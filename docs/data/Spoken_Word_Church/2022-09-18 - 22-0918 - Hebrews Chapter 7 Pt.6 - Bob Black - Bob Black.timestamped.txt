[0:00] that we unpacked this morning and I pray
[0:01] Lord that you'll bless us as we study
[0:03] these things out and be with brother
[0:05] Ronnie as he's preparing Lord to bring
[0:07] us the word this morning
[0:09] granted Lord that you'll just set our
[0:11] hearts in order Lord Jesus to receive
[0:13] what you have for us this morning in
[0:14] your name amen
[0:17] so now we've kind of been going through
[0:20] Hebrews chapter 7 and and as we meditate
[0:23] on these scriptures as we as we look
[0:25] through them
[0:26] um think about
[0:27] um now these are my words the theme of
[0:29] Hebrews is Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1.
[0:33] that Paul's trying to sit in our mind
[0:35] that that um all of these things that
[0:37] that uh the Jews the Hebrews understood
[0:40] about the Old Testament were a shadow of
[0:42] the things that now he was pointing to
[0:44] that Christ had come and paid the price
[0:46] for us for all of our sin for uh for our
[0:49] healing for our Redemption and so he's
[0:52] saying in Hebrews chapter 10 we just
[0:54] skip ahead to that chapter and then
[0:55] we'll drop back to Hebrews chapter seven
[0:57] he said for the law having a shadow of
[0:59] good things to come and not the very
[1:01] image of the things can never with those
[1:04] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:06] year continually make the comers there
[1:08] unto perfect
[1:10] so he's trying to sit and sit in the uh
[1:13] the Hebrews mind the people that he's
[1:15] talking to in that day you're reading
[1:17] this letter that he wrote
[1:19] that now we have access to something
[1:21] that was in the Old Testament it was
[1:23] just an image uh looking looking ahead
[1:26] to something that was coming now you
[1:28] think about what a shadow all the
[1:31] shadows in the Old Testament just kind
[1:33] of run through a few that Joni and the
[1:34] Jonah in the belly of the well for three
[1:36] days and three nights was a shadow of
[1:38] Christ that would die and be in the
[1:40] earth and that the bronze serpent was
[1:43] also a shadow of
[1:44] Christ suffering on the cross and and
[1:47] like the bronze Serpent of sand
[1:49] representing sin already judged there on
[1:51] that tree or on the staff that was held
[1:54] up if all the people would just look at
[1:56] him and look just look at it they would
[1:58] live and the man of the Phil in the
[2:00] wilderness was was actually something
[2:02] that they ate but still was a shadow of
[2:04] of he said I am that bread of life that
[2:06] came down from God out of Heaven he was
[2:08] he was the Fulfillment of that shadow
[2:10] and the rock that the Israelites drank
[2:12] from was a shadow of Christ who was our
[2:14] rock that out of him comes well a
[2:17] Wellspring of everlasting life and the
[2:19] Tabernacle in the wilderness was a
[2:21] shadow of of of Christ and and the model
[2:23] of of our of our new birth that God will
[2:26] take us through the outer Court inner
[2:28] core the holy of holies and uh a model
[2:31] of the of the human condition that
[2:32] you've got a body and a spirit and a
[2:34] soul it's a shadow of who of the thing
[2:37] that now we can look at and see our
[2:39] Redemption through Christ and the first
[2:41] Adam was a shadow of the second Adam was
[2:43] as it was laid out in Romans chapter 5
[2:45] 14. and the Passover Lamb was a
[2:48] something that they ate but was a shadow
[2:50] of of Christ dying for us and now we eat
[2:54] his body word as we're as we come to
[2:56] church and we we we read the Bible and
[2:59] we we're actually partaking of of the
[3:02] whole thing eat the whole thing like
[3:04] like they had to do it there in the
[3:05] evening time when the Cities of Refuge
[3:08] were a shadow of of Christ that we've
[3:10] got somewhere that we can run to when we
[3:12] when we do something that we're not
[3:14] supposed to do that we you know they
[3:15] they would run until they got to that
[3:17] City and when they got to the city they
[3:19] were safe and the temple veil was a
[3:21] shadow of Christ's body that was torn on
[3:23] the cross and Isaac the promised son was
[3:26] a shadow of Christ that would come and
[3:28] Elisha feeding a hundred men with 20
[3:29] loaves was a shadow of Christ that would
[3:31] sit on that hill and feed feed all of
[3:34] the different ones that were gathered
[3:35] there were just a few uh fish and a few
[3:38] loaves of bread
[3:39] and even Elisha there's so many so many
[3:41] things that you could go through with in
[3:43] the Old Testament there were a shadow of
[3:44] other things that now we can see and and
[3:46] substance in reality Elisha's body dead
[3:49] body Elisha's dead body giving somebody
[3:51] life the Elisha's body laying there in a
[3:54] grave but yet when somebody touched it
[3:56] they came back to life could touched his
[3:58] bones and Christ died for us and his his
[4:01] death is what gives us life and so
[4:03] Elisha's dead body was a shadow of
[4:05] Christ and all these things that we're
[4:08] speaking of so now Paul's trying to set
[4:10] in our mind that now we've got the
[4:12] reality and that Melchizedek in Hebrews
[4:14] chapter 7 is is what he's pointing to a
[4:17] shadow of things to come than the Old
[4:19] Testament the law gave us what God
[4:21] demanded but Calvary gave us a provision
[4:25] that satisfied God's demand
[4:30] you see if you go back and study and I
[4:32] hope you are as it go back and read
[4:33] through Hebrews chapter 7 and see what
[4:35] uh just kind of study it out and
[4:37] meditate on those things that as Paul's
[4:39] talking about Melchizedek he begins to
[4:41] wind up that chapter talking about how
[4:43] we knew we need a new priest the
[4:44] priesthood change the law changed
[4:46] everything changed because he's he's
[4:49] now where where God gave us is
[4:52] requirements now we've got a priest an
[4:55] eternal priesthood not just a priesthood
[4:57] that uh you know that where they they
[4:59] have to keep passing it down to the next
[5:01] then their their son and on down through
[5:04] generations but we've got an eternal
[5:05] priesthood in Christ Jesus who can who
[5:08] who paid the price for us and who
[5:09] satisfied all of God's demands in the
[5:12] law
[5:13] so Hebrews chapter 7 says for there is
[5:17] verily in verse 18 verily a disannulling
[5:20] of the Commandment going before for the
[5:22] weakness and unprofitableness thereof
[5:24] there's no way for the law to make you
[5:26] perfect the law can tell you you're not
[5:27] perfect that you need something but the
[5:30] law there's something else is required
[5:32] what it was require the life of God and
[5:34] to believe the Life of Christ that he
[5:37] would give his life on the cross to pay
[5:39] the price for you that that same life
[5:41] could come and live in The Believer for
[5:43] the law made nothing perfect but the
[5:46] bringing in of a better hope did by the
[5:48] which we draw nigh unto God so that's
[5:51] really you know that that's that's the
[5:53] sense I believe of what Paul is trying
[5:54] to communicate to us in Hebrews chapter
[5:56] 7. the bringing in of a better hope
[6:02] now what is that better hope you know we
[6:04] talked about it laying out that that
[6:06] shadow of thinking good things to come
[6:07] in the Old Testament when when
[6:09] Melchizedek came walking up to Abraham
[6:12] and and and they had he served in Bread
[6:15] and Wine and then you can see how that
[6:17] foreshadows Christ there in that upper
[6:19] room and he's serving his disciples of
[6:21] bread and wine and even what did that
[6:23] foreshadow what did that represent that
[6:24] actually represented him dying on the
[6:27] cross for us where Jesus said this is
[6:29] the blood my blood of the new testament
[6:31] which is shed for many
[6:33] for the remission of sin so they're on
[6:36] that cross what's the difference between
[6:37] that man that met that met Abraham that
[6:40] man was that God in theophany come down
[6:43] but then he rode himself in flesh and
[6:45] became my Kinsmen Redeemer that man that
[6:48] talked to Abraham uh came and and was
[6:51] born in a manger to be our Kinsmen to
[6:54] die on the cross so that we could have
[6:55] his same life
[6:58] so in verse 6 it says but he whose
[7:00] descent is not counted from them
[7:02] received tithes of Abraham and blessed
[7:04] him that had the promises
[7:06] and without all contradiction the less
[7:08] is blessed of the better and here are
[7:10] men that die receive tithes but he there
[7:12] he receiveth him of whom it has
[7:13] witnessed that he liveth and as I may so
[7:15] so say Levi also who receiveth ties paid
[7:19] tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the
[7:22] loins of his father when Melchizedek met
[7:24] him and see there's Paul he's trying to
[7:27] set out that that uh in our mind to to
[7:30] have to understand that that that Levi
[7:33] was was part of Abraham and he actually
[7:35] paid tithes to him in the same way that
[7:37] you were part of Christ God knew and he
[7:40] had it all planned out he he he knew you
[7:43] were coming and he had he had uh he had
[7:46] the whole the whole story all planned
[7:48] out he wasn't surprised by anything
[7:49] brother said in things that are to be
[7:52] he said you were all pre-planned by God
[7:55] nothing happens by chance with God he
[7:58] knows all about it it's all pre-planned
[8:01] planned for many generations back so
[8:03] that you could be here tonight did you
[8:06] know that
[8:07] just think that you at one time I repeat
[8:09] this again you at one time was in your
[8:12] father in the gene or your father now he
[8:14] didn't know you at that time neither did
[8:15] you know him at that time but you see
[8:17] then you were put in the betting ground
[8:19] in the womb of mother through holy
[8:21] wedlock and then you become a person
[8:22] expressed in the image like your father
[8:24] then there's Fellowship so you see what
[8:27] Paul's talking about is he said he said
[8:29] as I may so say Levi also who receiveth
[8:33] ties paid tithes in Abraham for he was
[8:36] yet in the loins of his father when
[8:38] Melchizedek met him
[8:40] brother Raymond said in God's power to
[8:42] transform you or in the loins of your
[8:44] father but your father could not have
[8:46] any fellowship with you until you was
[8:47] transformed into a body of Flesh my son
[8:50] there was in me I wanted a son but he
[8:52] was in me then see he was in me then but
[8:54] through wedlock he was transformed into
[8:56] a man like me and then he become like me
[8:59] all you think about Jeremiah saying
[9:02] before of God telling Jeremiah before I
[9:04] formed again the belly I knew thee and
[9:06] before thou came us forth out of the
[9:08] womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained
[9:11] thee a prophet unto the Nations
[9:13] that's something that if we could
[9:15] realize that God knew before the
[9:16] foundation of the world that we'd be
[9:18] sitting here this morning that that he
[9:19] knew that you would have need of
[9:21] something and if we can sit in our minds
[9:23] that that the minister is going to come
[9:24] forth is going to give us exactly what
[9:26] we have need of because God knew before
[9:28] the foundation of the world that we he
[9:30] knew we didn't need it he knew you'd be
[9:31] sitting here
[9:33] I think that should give Comfort to any
[9:34] believer to know that God God had it all
[9:37] your whole life and your the eternal
[9:40] life the day you would get it and
[9:41] everything all planned out he said in
[9:44] spiritual Amnesia he said notice and he
[9:45] is in me and I in him every Christian
[9:48] that's a real genuine Christian was with
[9:50] him with the morning Stars
[9:55] sang together in the sons of God shout
[9:57] out for Joy before there was a
[9:59] foundation of the world
[10:02] we were identified in the immortal
[10:04] Realms with God 10 million years before
[10:06] the world was ever formed I was back
[10:08] there with him if I got eternal life I
[10:12] was there with him I was identified with
[10:14] him when the morning star sang together
[10:16] and the sons of God shouted for joy
[10:19] and you think look at that little the
[10:21] little graph I got I've got over here on
[10:23] the other side that ate from Abraham to
[10:25] Isaac to Jacob the Levi that's a that's
[10:27] a long way but yet God God knew Levi was
[10:30] coming all the way back then before uh
[10:33] four generations back
[10:38] see what are we what are we talking
[10:39] about this morning with the Melchizedek
[10:41] Abraham met eternal life walking up to
[10:44] him and that same that same eternal life
[10:46] was manifested In the Flesh and died on
[10:49] the cross for you so that that same
[10:50] eternal life would come back into you
[10:52] into the believer you think about that
[10:55] God uh we were we were trying to tying
[10:57] back into Genesis 1 26 27 that God had
[11:00] it all mapped out the the part of
[11:03] himself that was going to be manifested
[11:05] in you and one day one day you you
[11:07] turned aside you heard the word preached
[11:09] and you were connected with that eternal
[11:11] life when you received it like brother
[11:13] Randall said in the message Investments
[11:14] and the messages leadership and the
[11:16] message things that are to be you
[11:18] receive the Holy Ghost you receive an
[11:21] eternal life so brother I'm sending the
[11:23] message identification when you receive
[11:25] eternal life there is only one forming
[11:27] of eternal life that's the Greek word
[11:29] Zoe is that right brother God's own life
[11:32] so you being a son you become part of
[11:35] that life so the life that's in you
[11:37] never did begin and it never can end
[11:41] I I hope maybe I don't know if you can
[11:43] see this this chart too good but the top
[11:44] part is that the eternity Genesis 1 26
[11:48] 27 and the bottom part is time down here
[11:52] in time you were born in sin you you
[11:54] went through a journey born from your
[11:55] your natural mother and father but there
[11:57] came a time when you got connected to
[12:00] Eternity when you receive the word and
[12:02] the word that you heard was quick and
[12:03] now you're you're connected back with
[12:05] what God foreknew you to be before the
[12:08] foundation of the world and God's power
[12:10] to transform he said just as you were in
[12:12] your father at the beginning a germ seed
[12:14] did you know that every one of you you
[12:17] were in your great great great great
[12:18] grandfather also did you know that read
[12:21] the book of Hebrews read the book of
[12:23] Hebrews he's saying where that we find
[12:25] that Levi paid tithes when he was in the
[12:28] loins of Abraham four generations behind
[12:30] him when Abraham paid ties to
[12:32] Melchizedek it was accounted to his
[12:34] great great grandson down below him and
[12:37] he was then in the loins of Abraham
[12:40] there you see
[12:42] so what are we talking about
[12:44] eternal life
[12:45] my brother said in the possessing all
[12:47] things he said now we find out that he
[12:49] that he met him and after the promise
[12:51] had been Vindicated he had Fellowship
[12:53] Melchizedek come out to bless Abraham
[12:56] and he said Blessed Be Abraham and
[12:58] blessed be the god of Abraham the
[13:00] possessor of heavens and earth earth oh
[13:03] my how I like that believer's promise
[13:06] you say what's that got to do with us
[13:09] maybe this morning you're thinking
[13:10] what's what's all these things that
[13:12] we're studying about got to do with me
[13:13] what's it what has got to do with you is
[13:15] there's a promise laid in God's word a
[13:18] promise of eternal life to every
[13:20] believer the Believers promises eternal
[13:22] life the believer's promise is life joy
[13:25] peace long-suffering gentleness patience
[13:27] fruits of the spirit Divine Healing a
[13:30] dozen things I got wrote down here
[13:32] nearly that is your possession
[13:35] it's your possession because you're part
[13:37] of him
[13:39] so in verse 11 of Hebrews chapter 7 it
[13:42] says if therefore Perfection were by the
[13:45] levitical priesthood if you could get
[13:47] perfected by the levitical priesthood
[13:49] what do you need another priesthood for
[13:51] for Andre the people received the law
[13:52] what further need was there another
[13:54] priest that should rise after the order
[13:56] of Melchizedek and not be called after
[13:59] the order of Aaron now if you ever read
[14:01] the Pilgrim's Progress you remember that
[14:03] how the pilgrims started off with that
[14:05] that burden on his back and he went on
[14:07] he went journeying with that bird he was
[14:09] trying to get rid of the burden and the
[14:10] only thing that can get rid of that
[14:11] burden of Pilgrim in that story was the
[14:14] cross that's the only thing that we can
[14:16] get rid of our bird and that's why we
[14:18] needed another priest because what's
[14:19] going to get rid of your burden of
[14:21] trying to live trying to live right
[14:23] trying to do right what good does it do
[14:25] if you're like the Rich Young Ruler and
[14:27] you you do all the things but get down
[14:29] in your heart you still got iniquity
[14:30] down in your heart there's something
[14:32] wrong or something Twisted you can't
[14:34] love your brother you can't love God the
[14:36] way that you need to that what good does
[14:39] it do if you can keep all these things
[14:40] and like Jesus told the Rich Young
[14:43] Mueller yet there's you there's
[14:45] something lacking there's something
[14:46] lacking in your life we needed we needed
[14:49] a priesthood that's different from that
[14:51] old Old Testament priesthood an eternal
[14:52] priesthood that God himself would come
[14:55] and die for us so what's the if we go uh
[14:59] it's a little bit small I don't know if
[15:00] you can read all that but I'll just run
[15:03] through so the order the the order of
[15:05] the priesthood is is going to be changed
[15:07] from the order of Aaron to the order of
[15:10] Melchizedek the priesthood is going to
[15:12] be changed what's the difference now
[15:14] the order of Aaron was an imperfect
[15:16] priesthood but the order of Melchizedek
[15:18] is a perfect priesthood the order of
[15:21] Aaron is temporary you every year you
[15:23] got to repeat your sacrifices you've got
[15:24] to come back and you got to do it over
[15:26] and over again but the order of
[15:28] Melchizedek is a permanent atonement
[15:30] Christ entered in once for all
[15:33] the order of Aaron is insufficient but
[15:36] the order of Melchizedek is sufficient
[15:38] that Christ's sacrifice was sufficient
[15:40] to make a way for the believer's
[15:42] Perfection the order of Aaron can't
[15:44] reconcile man to God and can't represent
[15:46] God to man and can't remove the sin
[15:49] barrier but the order of Melchizedek can
[15:52] the order of Aaron cannot bring man to
[15:54] Perfection but the order of Melchizedek
[15:57] can the order of Aaron is just Earthly
[15:59] it's just a priesthood that's passed
[16:01] down according to the flesh but the
[16:02] order of Melchizedek is a royal Heavenly
[16:05] priesthood that isn't based on any
[16:07] carnal linears that's passed down from
[16:09] generation to generation but it's based
[16:11] on eternal life
[16:12] the order of air and the priesthood
[16:15] after the order of Aaron is that that
[16:17] the priest the priest that comes to
[16:18] represent you as a sinner his own self
[16:20] but the priesthood after the order of
[16:22] Melchizedek is a as a priest that is
[16:24] sinless the high priesthood after the
[16:28] order of air and is is under sentence of
[16:30] death and under condemnation of the law
[16:32] but the priesthood after the order of
[16:34] Melchizedek it broke the power of death
[16:36] and fulfills all the requirements of the
[16:39] law through Christ faith in Christ
[16:41] sacrifice
[16:42] so if we keep reading through Hebrews
[16:45] chapter 7 it says in verse 12 for the
[16:48] priesthood being changed there is made
[16:50] of necessity a change also of the law
[16:54] for he of whom these things are spoken
[16:57] pertaineth to another tribe not Levi but
[17:00] now he's going to talk about Judy he's
[17:01] flipping everything over
[17:02] of which no man gave attendance at the
[17:04] altar for it is evident that our Lord
[17:07] spring out of Judah of which try Moses
[17:11] spake nothing concerning priesthood and
[17:13] it is yet far more evident for that
[17:15] after the similitude of Melchizedek
[17:17] there ariseth another priest who is made
[17:19] not after the law of a carnal
[17:22] commandment but after the power of an
[17:24] endless life
[17:25] of God sends his power into the church
[17:27] to make you live different and think
[17:29] different and to to to to cover cover
[17:32] over all of your sins
[17:36] to satisfy everything that the carnal
[17:38] commandment could not
[17:40] for he testifies thou art a priest
[17:43] Forever After the order of Melchizedek
[17:48] for there is verily a disannulling of
[17:50] the Commandment going before for the
[17:52] weakness
[17:53] and unprofitableness thereof for the law
[17:56] made nothing perfect but the bringing in
[17:59] of a better hope did by the which we
[18:02] draw nigh unto God
[18:04] that's right
[18:05] what kind of a new commandment are we
[18:07] talking about the Commandment that
[18:09] Jeremiah prophesied of in Jeremiah 31
[18:12] where he said behold the days come saith
[18:14] the Lord that I will make a New Covenant
[18:17] with the house of Israel and with the
[18:19] house of Judah not according to the
[18:21] Covenant
[18:23] that I made with their fathers in the
[18:25] day that I took them by the hand to
[18:27] bring them out of the land of Egypt
[18:28] which my Covenant they break although I
[18:31] was a husband unto them saith the Lords
[18:33] he's saying I'm not going to make a
[18:34] covenant where with all these things
[18:36] that you've got to keep but I'm listen
[18:38] to The Covenant he's going to make but
[18:40] this shall be the Covenant that I will
[18:41] make with the house of Israel after
[18:43] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[18:45] law and their inward parts and ride it
[18:48] in their hearts and will be their God
[18:50] and they shall be my people and they
[18:53] shall teach no more every man his
[18:54] neighbor and every man his brother
[18:56] saying know the Lord for they shall all
[18:58] know me from the least of them unto the
[19:00] greatest of them saith the Lord for I
[19:02] will forgive their iniquity and I will
[19:04] remember their sin no more you think
[19:06] about what a blessing it is that that
[19:07] that law that Moses came down from the
[19:10] mountain with if you could take that law
[19:11] that was on the stone and put it into a
[19:14] believer's heart now that law that they
[19:16] looked at and kind of pondered over but
[19:18] now it's alive inside of a Believer
[19:20] living and walking onto your feet now
[19:23] you can love somebody the way that I
[19:26] somebody smites your face or or spits on
[19:29] you you can love them back because the
[19:32] law that was on those tables of stone is
[19:34] now written on the tables of your heart
[19:37] so that's you you now we I I told you we
[19:40] were gonna we're gonna put put things
[19:43] together all the way from Melchizedek
[19:45] serving Bread and Wine to Abraham bring
[19:48] it all the way over to Christ in that
[19:51] Upper Room serving Bread and Wine is a
[19:53] type of the New Testament the New
[19:55] Testament has blood The Life of Christ
[19:57] and and his flesh being broken on the
[20:00] cross his life being poured out so that
[20:03] we could have fellowship with him so
[20:05] that all those attributes that were in
[20:06] him could be put on display and
[20:08] manifested and he could have fellowship
[20:10] with us and and talk with us in love
[20:12] with and show and reveal itself to us so
[20:15] brother Adam said
[20:17] in Hebrews chapter 7 he said when he was
[20:20] preaching this he said you can't no
[20:21] matter what you do you quit drinking
[20:24] quit smoking quit telling lies go to
[20:26] church and try to do this and try to do
[20:28] that you're still carnal that's just law
[20:31] the law makes nothing perfect but what
[20:35] makes perfect Christ I might quit lying
[20:38] quit stealing quit committing adultery
[20:40] quit chewing quit all the things and I'm
[20:42] still carnal God don't receive it
[20:44] because I have nothing to offer him in
[20:46] propitiation but the minute that I lay
[20:48] my hands upon the Blessed head of the
[20:50] Lord Jesus and say Lord I'm no good will
[20:52] you take me as your servant and God
[20:54] kisses away my sin I stand perfect in
[20:57] the sight of God
[20:58] I'm not standing on my own Merit
[21:08] standing on kids
[21:12] and he has perfected us through his
[21:14] suffering and his blood
[21:18] that's that's the melchized that Paul is
[21:21] talking about in Hebrews chapter 7. I'm
[21:23] not standing on my own merits like the
[21:25] Rich Young Ruler when Jesus talked to
[21:27] him in verse 17 of Mark chapter 10 he
[21:30] said when he was going forth into the
[21:31] way there came one running and kneeled
[21:33] to him and asked him good Master what
[21:34] shall I do that I may inherit eternal
[21:36] life
[21:37] he was trying to interrupt life eternal
[21:39] life by just keeping the law and Jesus
[21:41] said unto him why call us without me
[21:43] good there is none good but one that is
[21:45] God thou knowest the Commandments do not
[21:47] commit adultery they're not killed and I
[21:48] still do not bear false witness defraud
[21:50] not honor thy father and mother and he
[21:52] answered and said I am master all these
[21:54] have I observed from my youth then Jesus
[21:57] beholding him loved him and said unto
[21:59] him one thing thou lack us go thy way
[22:01] sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to
[22:04] the poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[22:06] heaven and come
[22:08] take up the cross and follow me
[22:12] there's something we need that goes
[22:14] beyond just keeping the law just being a
[22:16] good church member just coming and
[22:17] paying your tithes but we've got to be
[22:19] born again
[22:20] in Hebrews chapter 7 if we keep reading
[22:22] he's in verse 20 he said and as much as
[22:24] not without enough he was made priests
[22:26] for those priests were made without an
[22:28] oath but this with an oath by him that
[22:31] said unto him the Lord swear and will
[22:33] not repent thou art a priest Forever
[22:35] After the order of Melchizedek but by so
[22:38] much was Jesus made a surety of a better
[22:42] Testament and that the scripture that we
[22:44] keep going back to in Psalm 110 the Lord
[22:46] has sworn and not will not repent thou
[22:48] art a priest Forever After the order of
[22:51] Melchizedek
[22:53] God God made an oath he made an oath to
[22:56] Abraham that he was going to give a
[22:57] promise he made an oath that during
[22:59] Psalms that he was going to send a
[23:00] priest after the order of Melchizedek so
[23:02] brother Brown was saying in the water of
[23:04] Separation in 1955 he said the Old
[23:06] Testament we had laws and bylaws and
[23:08] things that people had to do by The
[23:10] Works of the law to be saved but God
[23:12] wound everything in the Old Testament
[23:14] right up and put it in Calvary that
[23:16] believer hath now only has one thing to
[23:19] do look to Calvary and be born again
[23:22] that's all it is just so simple the laws
[23:26] and all the ceremonies and everything
[23:27] passed away with the shedding of the
[23:29] blood when my shadow was coming to me
[23:31] when my shadow and I meet my shadow was
[23:34] no more but I took the place of my
[23:36] shadow and that's the way the law was
[23:38] and so forth the Old Testament was the
[23:41] shadow of the New Testament and was
[23:43] fulfilled Grace and law met at Calvary
[23:45] and law was fulfilled and Grace come
[23:49] into existence
[23:51] Paul said in verse 23 and they truly
[23:53] were many priests
[23:55] because they were not suffered to
[23:56] continue by reason of death
[23:58] but this man because he continuous ever
[24:02] hath an unchangeable priesthood
[24:04] wherefore he is able also to save them
[24:07] to the uttermost that come unto God by
[24:09] him seeing he ever liveth to make
[24:12] intercession for them for such an high
[24:15] priest became us who was wholly harmless
[24:17] undefiled separate from Sinners and made
[24:20] higher than the heavens and brother
[24:22] around said this about this he said
[24:24] there it is now if I try to represent my
[24:26] own case I'll lose it if I try to
[24:29] represent say well my daddy was a good
[24:30] man my daddy was a preacher well I've
[24:32] lived in church I still lost it but this
[24:35] man is a perfect one to Christ he sits
[24:38] there and offers his blood constantly
[24:40] for my sins
[24:41] there you are
[24:43] so in verse 27 Paul said we who needs us
[24:46] not daily as those High priests to offer
[24:48] of sacrifice first for his own sins and
[24:51] then for the peoples for this did he
[24:54] wants when he offered up himself and the
[24:57] musicians can go ahead and come forward
[24:58] for the law maketh men High priests
[25:01] which have infirmity but the word of the
[25:03] oath which was since the law maketh the
[25:05] son who was consecrated forevermore
[25:07] what's the word of the oath the oath
[25:09] that I'm sinning a promise I'm sending
[25:11] the promise of a priest after the order
[25:13] of Melchizedek to give you eternal life
[25:16] in Genesis chapter 22 he made Abraham
[25:19] that promise of a promised son and in
[25:21] Psalm 2 1 10 he made a promise of a
[25:24] priest after the order of Melchizedek
[25:26] and brother Graham said again he said
[25:28] but the real thing is this nothing in my
[25:30] arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling
[25:33] oh God naked Wounded Knee sucker oh I
[25:36] most only come Christ confessing that I
[25:39] am nothing and there's nothing Within Me
[25:41] perceive Me O God then God receives you
[25:45] now you might not even know your ABCs
[25:48] you might not know coffee from split
[25:49] peas you might not know G from hall
[25:52] right from left hand it won't don't make
[25:54] any difference what you don't know
[25:55] there's one thing you must know that
[25:57] Jesus Christ took your place as a sinner
[26:00] and you take your place to stand in his
[26:03] righteousness confessing every day that
[26:05] you're wrong and love him with all your
[26:07] heart and your whole motives be set
[26:09] towards him you'll make Heaven that's
[26:11] all there is to it for the love that was
[26:13] in Christ for the life that was in
[26:14] Christ has to be in you or your loss
[26:17] there's the theme of Hebrews chapter 7.
[26:21] and brother Rams are Paul said in verse
[26:23] 28 he said for the law maketh men High
[26:25] priests which have infirmity but the
[26:27] word of the oath which was since the law
[26:30] maketh the son who was consecrated
[26:31] forevermore you think about that the
[26:33] lyrics of that song Rock of Ages cleft
[26:35] for me is speaking of that oath the
[26:38] immutable two immutable things that a
[26:40] God who cannot lie made a promise of
[26:43] eternal life Rock of Ages Cliff for me
[26:46] let me hide myself a knee let the water
[26:48] and the blood from thy wounded side
[26:50] which flowed be of sin the double cure
[26:53] and brother Brandon said double cure he
[26:56] swore by it two immutable things that a
[27:00] God that cannot lie made a promise to
[27:02] you
[27:03] we've got something that we can lay hold
[27:05] on this morning
[27:07] I hate on those words as you prepare for
[27:09] the for the sermon this morning and just
[27:10] think about that and let it build up
[27:12] your faith in you this morning God bless
[27:14] you
