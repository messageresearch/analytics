[3:15] See, we will get
[3:19] this. Brother Anderson, I may need you,
[3:24] brother. So, yeah, I want to get this in
[3:27] in presentation mode here.
[3:30] We did it last
[3:41] [Music]
[3:53] time.
[3:55] Yeah, we try that. I do
[4:02] it. I miss
[4:04] [Music]
[4:13] things. It's one minute. We'll get it.
[4:15] We'll get it right.
[4:17] [Music]
[4:52] Okay, getting close.
[5:02] [Music]
[5:08] Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. All
[5:12] right. Well, that's five minutes. We'll
[5:15] go
[5:17] faster. Amen. So, we're going to
[5:19] continue talking about wisdom. We
[5:21] started that last time. The wisdom,
[5:23] wisdom to be free. And certainly honored
[5:26] by God's grace to have this opportunity
[5:27] again to present this Sunday school. And
[5:30] you know, financial jubilee, as as our
[5:32] prophet was just saying that that
[5:33] message that was on, press on. Keep
[5:36] pressing on. And everything that we're
[5:37] doing for the Lord, keep pressing on.
[5:41] Amen. Financial jubilee. Those things
[5:43] that you've learned and heard, keep
[5:45] pressing on in those things. You know,
[5:47] again, as talked about, we have
[5:48] testimonies and challenges that that's
[5:50] right here in this church of of us
[5:53] pressing on as brothers and sisters in
[5:54] Christ. And the pattern that we see in
[5:57] financial jubilee, it's just the same
[5:59] pattern. It's the same application in
[6:01] all areas of your life. The same
[6:04] application, the same pressing on that
[6:06] we need in the areas of our finances. We
[6:09] need that in the areas of our family. We
[6:11] need that in the areas of our faith. We
[6:13] need that in the areas of of fitness,
[6:15] mental fitness, mental stability. We
[6:19] need that in all of the factors of life.
[6:21] It's the same exact
[6:24] principles. And when we talk about
[6:26] wisdom, it's about hearing, recognizing,
[6:29] and acting. You know, that's when you
[6:31] really get into understanding. You don't
[6:34] really understand if you're just
[6:36] hearing. It has to be a recognizing what
[6:39] what is what what are we talking about?
[6:41] And then that has to go further where
[6:42] you're able to act on what you hear and
[6:45] what you
[6:46] recognize. You know, financial jubilee.
[6:49] uh my son, he's a good example, you
[6:51] know, and when God started showing me
[6:53] and my wife about finances and and all
[6:55] of that, you know, we were playing Dave
[6:56] Ramsey on the road and and finding
[6:58] everything we could about managing
[7:00] money. It was new to me and they would
[7:03] hear it. Oh, I'd be so excited. I start
[7:05] telling them about it and they that's
[7:06] all they heard driving back and forth,
[7:09] you know, Dave Rams going at it and I'm
[7:11] like, man, it is I didn't know this
[7:13] existed. And I try to tell them and I'll
[7:16] get ideas. All right, guys. y'all going
[7:17] to earn your chores and you got a glass
[7:20] for saving, one for giving, you know,
[7:22] and um one for spending. And we tried to
[7:25] teach them and they were hearing. Okay.
[7:28] And then, you know, they were doing well
[7:29] until they hit about them teenage years,
[7:32] you know, about 18. John like I hear
[7:34] that, but I hear other stuff,
[7:36] too. I hear that, but I hear this.
[7:39] Daddy, do you hear this? You start
[7:41] hearing other things. So, now he's
[7:44] getting old. He's getting more mature,
[7:46] right? But he's hearing so many
[7:48] different things. We're just one of
[7:49] many, many voices. And it's the same for
[7:52] all of us in all areas. There are many
[7:54] voices speaking to us. How are we going
[7:56] to recognize the voice that we need to
[7:59] hear? So slow enough, he starts making
[8:02] different decisions and you know, just
[8:03] different decisions than I would
[8:05] make. And um still I'm still trying to
[8:08] get it out. Are you hearing? It's going
[8:10] to cost you. It's going to cost you. Can
[8:14] you recognize what I'm saying? Slowly
[8:16] starts making decisions. Things start
[8:19] going differently after a while. First,
[8:21] it's good. It's Hey, it's good. He might
[8:23] be doing better than dad. You know, you
[8:26] know, we used to hear the the older
[8:28] generations used to tell us when we was
[8:30] coming along said, "It took us 30 years
[8:32] to get this." And of course, the young
[8:34] people like, "Uh-uh, it going to take me
[8:36] a year. You watch. See me." You're like,
[8:39] "Okay, okay, young stuff. You'll see.
[8:44] But sure enough, he started realizing
[8:46] and started learning from some of the
[8:47] lessons. And then slowly you see him
[8:49] starting to recognize, wow, financial
[8:52] jubilee does work. It is the way to go.
[8:55] My now he's preaching to me, Dad. Yeah.
[8:58] I heard this guy on YouTube saying, "You
[9:00] just do it with cash. Just do it on a
[9:02] loan. Don't spend your cash. That's
[9:05] foolish." Amen. Amen. It's recognizing
[9:09] and acting. And that's what God wants us
[9:11] to do. When we are able to hear,
[9:14] recognize, and act, we will see God in
[9:17] motion. I thank the Lord that he's he's
[9:19] a God that rewards. He's a God that
[9:22] shows you. He'll show you the next step.
[9:24] If you're able to take that one step,
[9:26] he'll show you the next step and reward
[9:29] you for the step that you took. That's
[9:31] very important because we need to see.
[9:33] We're human beings. We need to see. And
[9:35] if you can do it in finances, he'll do
[9:37] that in every area of your life to show
[9:40] you you're walking right. It's not easy,
[9:43] but he'll show you.
[9:45] Hearing when the trumpet sounded, every
[9:47] man could be free if he wanted to go
[9:49] free. That's the word. It's hearing the
[9:52] word, hearing. But then there's a choice
[9:54] to it. If you want to go free, recognize
[9:58] his lord said unto him, "Well done, good
[10:00] and faithful servant. Thou has been
[10:01] faithful over a few things. I will make
[10:03] thee ruler over many things. enter thou
[10:05] into the joy of the Lord. Why do you
[10:08] want to go free? Why? That's the
[10:10] question. That's what recognizing is all
[10:12] about. You know, back in the slavery
[10:14] time when they came and said, "Hey,
[10:16] you're free." Some of the slaves didn't
[10:17] take that. This is talking about the
[10:19] African-American slaves, they didn't
[10:20] take it. They were used to being on
[10:21] their land. It was a difficult thing to
[10:24] go free. Some of them would say, "Why do
[10:27] I need to go free? I I got my food. I
[10:29] got I got what I need. Why do I want to
[10:31] go free for I don't understand.
[10:34] And many of us when we hear the go word
[10:36] of God, we hear the gospel being
[10:37] preached, we don't know, Lord, what what
[10:39] what do I need to go free for? What is
[10:41] it all about? Well, God being in the
[10:43] rewarding business, he's saying, if
[10:45] you're able to be faithful over a few
[10:47] things, I will make you ruler over many
[10:51] things. So, it's about dominion is about
[10:54] what his purpose is. In the Garden of
[10:56] Eden, he wanted us to subdue and have
[10:59] dominion. That's not going to change.
[11:02] You know, there's a song and it says,
[11:03] "Walk around heaven all day. When I get
[11:05] to heaven, I won't have anything to do."
[11:07] Well, I don't believe so. I don't
[11:09] believe that. I believe we're going to
[11:11] have a lot to do in heaven. Because in
[11:13] the Garden of Eden before the fall, he
[11:15] said, "You need to subdue." It was
[11:17] things that Adam had to do. And if we're
[11:20] going to be ruler over many things,
[11:22] there's things to do. So, here is the
[11:25] opportunity for us to get ready for
[11:27] those things that we're going to do. We
[11:30] don't know fully the picture, but it's
[11:32] things to do. Amen. And he's trying to
[11:34] prepare us here. So, it's a goal to be
[11:37] faithful over every area of our life.
[11:40] Faithful in these things that he may
[11:42] make us ruler over many things and enter
[11:45] into the joy of the Lord. Amen. That's
[11:49] our desire. So, that's recognizing why
[11:52] we need to be free act. Then, we need to
[11:56] go on and train and fight. We have to be
[11:58] doers of this word, not just hearers
[12:01] deceiving ourselves. That's it. We want
[12:04] to hear, we want to recognize, and we
[12:06] want to act. God has everything good for
[12:10] us. Everything that he has for us is
[12:13] good. It's all good. But we have to
[12:17] train and we have to fight for
[12:20] it. He says as we hear the word, when we
[12:24] hear this, we are free from sin. We are
[12:27] free from shackles. We are free from
[12:29] habits. We are free from smoking,
[12:31] drinking, carousing because the son of
[12:34] God has raised from the grave and has
[12:36] broke every feder. All condemnation is
[12:39] gone. The debt has been paid. The
[12:42] penalty is paid. The sins are washed
[12:45] away. And we are free. Oh, we are free
[12:49] people. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. And
[12:53] we're free from all that the devil would
[12:55] try to do. We're free. That's the same
[12:58] freedom those slaves heard. You're free.
[13:01] The sun is coming up today. We're free.
[13:05] Amen. Amen. And those who recognize what
[13:09] it meant. My I'm no longer limited to
[13:12] this
[13:13] plantation. The sky is the limit. My
[13:16] generations to come were free. I get to
[13:20] go and build whatever God has for my
[13:23] life now. Not what my slave master has
[13:25] for me, but what God has for me. I'm
[13:28] free to go pursue that and put in the
[13:31] work. Just like Esther, just the same
[13:34] thing. You're free to fight now. You're
[13:36] free. You don't have to let Mori come in
[13:39] and destroy. You are free to go and
[13:41] fight and defend yourself. We're free.
[13:45] We're free to cast down smoking,
[13:47] drinking, carousing these things that
[13:49] pull on us. These things that try to
[13:52] hinder us. We're free. That's God's
[13:55] part. He has done his part. He has paid
[13:58] the debt. We're free in Jesus name.
[14:01] Thank God for his part. Praise the Lord.
[14:05] Our part. And I'd say come, you got
[14:09] something to do. God just don't poke
[14:11] things down your neck. You got to
[14:12] believe it. You got to do some fighting.
[14:16] Amen. We got to believe and we have to
[14:18] fight. That's the only
[14:20] way. God's part again is to sound that
[14:23] trumpet. And it's our part to put it in
[14:25] action. Put in place what we're hearing.
[14:28] This word of God, this is one of my
[14:30] favorite quotes. Covers everything.
[14:32] Clean your lives up. Pay your debts. Oh
[14:35] no man. Jesus said, "Get all things off
[14:37] your hands. Get everything right. Make
[14:39] ready. Get ready. Remember, in the name
[14:42] of the Lord, something is fixing to
[14:44] happen. That's more than ever, my
[14:46] brothers and sisters. We're living in
[14:48] the time. We're living in it. We're
[14:51] living in it. Make ready. Get ready. My,
[14:55] it's so much to say just about us making
[14:58] ready, getting ourselves together
[15:01] mentally, physically, spiritually,
[15:04] everything. Anything could happen at any
[15:06] time. And this is not a a scare tactic
[15:09] to scare us. We have the word. We're
[15:12] special people. You know, God has always
[15:15] sent his special kings and queens,
[15:18] prophets. You look in the Bible, they
[15:20] were there to help them, to tell them,
[15:22] to set them on the right course. And we
[15:25] have the same thing. God has sent us a
[15:27] prophet to us to help us navigate where
[15:31] we are to let us know what's going to
[15:33] happen. We see it happening right before
[15:36] us. Yeah. My my
[15:38] my you know yesterday I was actually
[15:40] preparing for this this Sunday school
[15:43] and it was in the morning praying and
[15:46] earlier that morning you know I was just
[15:47] sitting there thinking about our prophet
[15:49] and I was thinking about California you
[15:51] know I was like my we know that thing is
[15:53] going to sink you know one of these days
[15:54] and I I thought you know how how is it
[15:56] going to be you know we've seen what co
[15:58] did and you know how the world and this
[16:02] big world that we thought was so big can
[16:04] just change in a matter of huh
[16:07] that we never even imagined it could. We
[16:10] thought it was too big that everything
[16:12] could be restricted everywhere, every
[16:15] country. My we saw it and I said, "Man,
[16:18] you know, California, that thing sinks.
[16:20] You know, the internet may be gone.
[16:21] What? We have built an infrastructure on
[16:23] the internet, man. You know, all your
[16:25] money in the bank account, you can't get
[16:27] to it." I said, "Man, all of a sudden,
[16:29] you know, military to go to the store
[16:32] and shop, man, this thing is my
[16:34] goodness." And I said, you know, I want
[16:36] we probably, you know, maybe it'll be a
[16:38] rumble or something. You know, that's
[16:40] what I was thinking. I said, maybe it'll
[16:41] be a rumble cuz, you know, California go
[16:43] down, we might get a little rumbling on
[16:45] this side. And I was thinking about that
[16:48] and then I just went on to prepare the
[16:49] Sunday school a little bit after
[16:57] that. I thought it was my daughter cuz
[16:59] he's upstairs in the room. I'm like,
[17:00] she's up, but what in the
[17:02] world? I said, "Well, maybe it's a
[17:04] helicopter." And I was getting ready to
[17:06] walk outside cuz about 15 seconds, this
[17:08] thing was
[17:10] still said, "Well, man, maybe it's a
[17:12] helicopter. It can't be a earthquake. I
[17:15] never felt that in my life." Said,
[17:18] "Man, I went on bing." Brother Anderson,
[17:22] did y'all feel
[17:24] that? Don't tell me you felt it, Brother
[17:26] Anderson. I said, "Lord said, yes,
[17:29] brother, I felt that." My goodness. I
[17:33] said, "Lord God, man, what what season
[17:35] and time are we truly in, my brothers
[17:38] and sisters? It's it's like it's like,
[17:40] Lord, help us. Get all things off your
[17:43] hands. Get ready. Get everything might
[17:46] right. Make ready." That's just nothing
[17:48] but the truth. That is nothing but the
[17:51] truth. Do all that we can in Jesus'
[17:54] name. Amen. See the goal is for us to be
[17:58] efficient servants. Efficient servants
[18:01] in the Lord. not hindered servants. I
[18:04] love this quote. Our prophet said, "And
[18:06] we ask that you'll be merciful to us
[18:08] today and grant unto us the
[18:10] understanding that we have need of that
[18:14] we might be a more efficient servant for
[18:17] thee." It's our heart desire to serve
[18:20] thee with reverence and with a true
[18:22] heart, and that you might get the very
[18:24] best out of our lives every day. May our
[18:28] walks be so that you'll be well pleased
[18:30] with the things that we did for that
[18:33] day. My Lord, help us to be efficient,
[18:37] efficient servants for the Lord. Amen.
[18:41] That's it. To be efficient, to be ready,
[18:44] not not hindered and caught up in all
[18:46] kind of things. All tangled up, all
[18:49] trapped up, unable to be efficient.
[18:53] The devil knows if he can just keep us
[18:56] hindered, he has us. Our prophet says,
[18:59] "What happened to you?" Paul said, "You
[19:01] did run well. What hindered you?" See,
[19:03] back there you was free from that stuff,
[19:06] but you wanted to be like the rest of
[19:08] them. What's happened? You did run well.
[19:11] What hindered you? It's become so common
[19:14] to you. You believe it all, sure, but it
[19:17] doesn't thrill you anymore. It's so
[19:19] common. God's so good to you and you
[19:22] don't realize it. My my my my
[19:26] my. You can see you can see what the
[19:28] devil is doing to us in this this time.
[19:31] His goal is to hinder us, hinder our
[19:34] walk. You see these two pictures here of
[19:36] this plant and this one plant has a rock
[19:38] on top. Our prophet said a stick or rock
[19:41] something falls on that thing. It it's a
[19:43] real genuine plant. We're real
[19:45] believers. We believe. But the devil has
[19:48] done everything to get our eyes looking
[19:51] at everything else. Everything else to
[19:54] make what we hear so common to us, you
[19:57] know, and yes, this is a new time. We've
[20:00] never been where we are today. I
[20:02] understand that many things have
[20:04] happened over the years and that's part
[20:06] of the journey. You know, I was telling
[20:08] my wife, you know, when God first got a
[20:09] hold of us, how how excited, you know,
[20:12] we were young, young young people and
[20:14] God changed our lives and man, then you
[20:16] start getting responsibilities and
[20:18] houses and cars and kids and different
[20:21] opinions, different ideas. People come,
[20:24] you know, you see a pastor may pass
[20:25] away, a family member pass away. That's
[20:28] the hardship of life start coming in,
[20:30] you know, and and all of a sudden, you
[20:32] know, man, you're you're seeing so many
[20:34] different things. people leaving this
[20:36] word, people questioning the word, all
[20:39] these kind of things challenges you as
[20:42] part of the tests and trials. That's
[20:43] part of this journey to put us through
[20:46] to see are we going to hold on to God's
[20:48] promises or is it just going to become
[20:50] common to us? My goodness, we are seeing
[20:53] the word of our prophet fulfilled in our
[20:56] day and time. We're seeing these things.
[20:59] Yes. Now, we have to keep a balance. Of
[21:00] course, we got to keep a balance until
[21:02] we know. We don't know. And that's just
[21:04] the truth, right? But that don't mean
[21:05] we're not pressing on and doing
[21:07] everything we can. And that's what
[21:08] cleaning up your lives is all about.
[21:10] It's about giving God the opportunity.
[21:12] You can see him in the small things. And
[21:14] he's ready to show us more and confirm
[21:17] more to us. We're ready to handle it.
[21:19] Amen. We have to be able to handle what
[21:21] God has for us. That's why we have to be
[21:23] faithful over a few things that he can
[21:25] add more to us, more revelation that we
[21:28] can handle.
[21:30] Amen. We can't run off and and then
[21:32] we're on the wrong track.
[21:33] The devil is looking for every
[21:35] opportunity to question our credibility
[21:38] in this word. What we don't know, we
[21:40] don't know. And that's just that. But
[21:42] what we do know, we do know. And that's
[21:45] a blessing to know that. And what we
[21:47] have is not common. And we don't need to
[21:49] take it for granted. God is good to us,
[21:51] our families. He's been so good to me
[21:54] more than I could even say. He's been so
[21:56] good. And I thank the Lord for that.
[21:59] Amen. But these hindrance these things
[22:01] looking at the rest of them we got
[22:04] internet temptations and all kind of
[22:06] things that challenges us in our
[22:09] walk so much we can
[22:11] see. Amen. Achen you know he got
[22:14] hindered by lust. Brother Brim said he
[22:16] hindered the entire battle. Hindered the
[22:19] entire battle. The 10 spies they got
[22:22] hindered by circumstances. We're not
[22:24] able to take it. David got hindered by
[22:26] distractions. And us, we're hindered in
[22:29] Lady Osia. We got all of those things,
[22:32] circumstances, distractions, every lust,
[22:35] everything you can name is aimed right
[22:36] at us. Amen. And what we have can become
[22:39] so
[22:40] common. So common. But if we can just
[22:43] reflect that God has been good to us in
[22:47] his wonderful name. That's why we need
[22:49] training. That's why we have to have
[22:51] training to act. We have to have the
[22:53] training to be able to act. Christian
[22:56] training. Colossians. I think this just
[22:58] kind of spells it out to me and what I'm
[23:00] sharing is all about as I shared in the
[23:02] last part one in Colossians Paul says to
[23:06] the saints and faithful brethren in
[23:07] Christ which are at Colise and then he
[23:10] goes if you read that chapter he's
[23:12] talking about how faithful they are and
[23:14] how loving they are you know they
[23:17] they've heard and they fa their faith in
[23:19] Christ he's talking about that how the
[23:21] gospel came and they're producing fruit
[23:23] he's saying all of these wonderful
[23:25] things about what they've been able to
[23:27] do. But then he goes to verse 9 and
[23:29] says, "For this cause, we also since the
[23:31] day we heard all of these good things,
[23:33] we do not cease to pray for you and
[23:36] desire that you might be filled with the
[23:38] knowledge of his will and all wisdom and
[23:41] spiritual
[23:43] understanding." He says, "Hey, I'm
[23:45] praying for you. All of these good
[23:47] things, but it's something more that you
[23:49] need." And I see that for myself. I see
[23:52] that in the churches. I see that that we
[23:54] need more because we need that we might
[23:57] be filled with the knowledge of his will
[23:59] and all wisdom and spiritual
[24:01] understanding. Verse 10 starts
[24:03] describing why that you might walk
[24:05] worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
[24:07] being fruitful in every good work and
[24:09] increasing in the knowledge of God,
[24:11] strengthened with all might according to
[24:13] his glorious power unto all patience and
[24:16] longsuffering with joyfulness. He
[24:19] started telling you a little bit about
[24:20] what this knowledge, wisdom, and
[24:22] spiritual understanding will bring. All
[24:24] the things that we need so we can walk
[24:27] worthy. So we can increase in the
[24:30] knowledge of God. So we can be fruitful
[24:32] in every good work. We can be
[24:33] strengthened with the Almighty. My
[24:35] goodness, that's exactly what we have
[24:37] need of, my brothers and sisters. That
[24:39] wisdom from the Lord. Proverb Proverbs 3
[24:42] breaks it down a little bit more. says,
[24:44] "Proverbs 3:13 says, "Happy is the man
[24:46] that findeth wisdom in the man that
[24:48] getth understanding. For the merchandise
[24:50] of it is better than the merchandise of
[24:52] silver, and the gain thereof than fine
[24:54] gold. She's more precious than rubies,
[24:57] and all things that thou can desire are
[24:59] not to be compared unto her. Length of
[25:01] days is in her right hand, and in her
[25:03] left hand riches and honor. Her ways are
[25:06] the ways of pleasantness, and all her
[25:08] paths are peace. She is a tree of life
[25:10] to them that lay hold upon her, and
[25:12] happy is everyone that retainth her.
[25:17] Proverbs 4:5, "Get wisdom, get
[25:19] understanding, forget it not, neither
[25:21] decline from the words of my mouth.
[25:24] Forsake her not, and she shall preserve
[25:26] thee. Love her, and she shall keep thee.
[25:29] Wisdom is the principle things.
[25:32] Therefore, get wisdom, and with all thy
[25:35] getting, get understanding. Exalt her
[25:38] and she will promote thee. She shall
[25:40] bring thee to honor when thou does
[25:42] embrace her. Wisdom is the principle
[25:46] thing. It's the main thing. It says it
[25:49] will preserve us. It will keep us. Keep
[25:51] us from what? Keep us from the pitfalls
[25:53] of this life.
[25:56] Pitfalls. That's the unsuspected hidden
[25:58] danger that's everywhere. That's in
[26:01] everything that we're living in. That's
[26:02] in Lady Yosia. That's what it is. Wisdom
[26:05] will keep us from those things. We need
[26:08] that wisdom in Jesus name. Knowledge,
[26:12] wisdom, and understanding. As we kind of
[26:14] close up here, knowledge, it's what gods
[26:17] want. It's the facts and the information
[26:19] from God and his
[26:20] will. Wisdom applying what he wants.
[26:24] It's the skillful applica and practical
[26:26] application of God's will in your life.
[26:30] Your life and understanding is why he
[26:32] wants it. It's the complete picture. is
[26:34] hearing, recognizing, and then acting.
[26:36] That's the full
[26:38] understanding. Wisdom is the actual
[26:42] application. You can watch YouTube. I
[26:44] have watched YouTube many times to learn
[26:46] how to fix something. And I get out
[26:47] there and it's, man, it seems very easy
[26:50] to take this whole piece off of this
[26:52] car. Matter of fact, they did in two
[26:54] minutes. Sped it up. Done. Wow. I'm
[26:58] ready. Get out there with my tool set,
[27:00] man. Fancy tool set. Get in there.
[27:03] getting that screw. Yep. Man, my screw
[27:06] happened to be rusted. My
[27:10] goodness. That's where wisdom comes in.
[27:12] It's practical application. I heard it.
[27:15] Seemed very
[27:17] easy. Five minutes, I'll be done. Saved
[27:20] me about a, you know, good
[27:22] $150. 3 to four hours later, man, it's
[27:26] going to the
[27:27] shop. They got a shop for a reason.
[27:32] Yes sir. My son started speaking to me.
[27:35] Dad, your your hours cost money. You've
[27:37] been out here four and a half, five
[27:39] hours. You could have saved
[27:40] that. So wisdom is the practical
[27:43] application as we apply God's word to
[27:45] our life. The hardships that's there.
[27:49] Your personal situation, your personal
[27:52] difficulties come into place. Your
[27:54] patience, your background, your history,
[27:57] all of that. It's very different from
[27:59] just hearing You have to now apply it.
[28:02] Some of that application may be, yeah,
[28:04] you need a little longer on your knees
[28:06] than maybe that person.
[28:09] You know, that person started with a
[28:10] little bit more than you had. You
[28:13] started with nothing. You started with
[28:15] two of your parents are divorced. They
[28:17] have a history. So, what may seem very
[28:19] easy to them may be a lifetime of prayer
[28:22] for you.
[28:24] Their grandparents could have left them
[28:25] a ton of money. Your grandparents could
[28:27] have left you in debt.
[28:30] Everybody has a different situation. And
[28:32] as you apply it, that's when it becomes
[28:34] practical to you. Lord, help me in my
[28:37] situation. I need your wisdom in my
[28:39] marriage. I need your wisdom in my
[28:42] situation. I need your wisdom with my
[28:44] kids. My kid, all I look at him one
[28:46] time, he'll stop and start crying. This
[28:48] kid, you whip him 10 times, he still
[28:50] ain't crying. He's telling you it don't
[28:53] hurt. You said, "Lord, help me." You
[28:57] need his wisdom in your situation, my
[29:00] brothers and sisters. That's the
[29:01] practical application of what we're
[29:03] hearing. The song leaders, song players
[29:06] can come on up. We just thank the Lord.
[29:08] We We need all that God has for us.
[29:12] Last quote
[29:13] here says, Proverbs 2:6 says, "For the
[29:16] Lord gives wisdom. From his mouth come
[29:19] knowledge and
[29:21] understanding." The word says, "I have
[29:23] taught thee in the way of wisdom. I have
[29:26] led thee in the right paths. Wisdom from
[29:29] God leads us in the right paths of our
[29:32] lives. There's two paths we know is a
[29:34] path of righteousness and it's the evil
[29:36] path. And God has taught us in his word.
[29:39] He's taught us. We've heard the word. We
[29:41] just need his wisdom to apply it. And we
[29:44] need the training to act on these things
[29:46] in areas of our life where we don't have
[29:49] wisdom. The word says, "Thank God for
[29:52] this word. If any of you lack wisdom,
[29:55] let him ask of God that giveth to all
[29:57] men liberally and upgradeth not, and it
[30:00] shall be given him. James 1:5. We can
[30:04] ask God. And I think it's such a time as
[30:06] this to ask God. We've never been here
[30:08] before, none of us. It's time to say,
[30:11] Lord Jesus, give us your wisdom in our
[30:14] whole area of our life and give us
[30:16] wisdom where we are today, this season.
[30:19] everything we see happening. Lord, we
[30:20] need your wisdom how to navigate where
[30:22] we are for our practical living
[30:26] situations in Jesus name. God bless you.
