amen let's give him a hand clap of praise amen good to be in the house of the lord today good to have each and every one of you here what a wonderful day to praise the lord amen i pray everybody have a good week bear with me today we're going to try something a little bit different we're going to see if we can come up into the 21st century and maybe use this now it's configuring brother anderson so i'm gonna have to wait just a minute so by way of announcements let's go ahead and get those out of the way um brother louise and sister christine and some of our youth are at the uh beaufort south carolina youth camp and they're having a wonderful time i think maybe this afternoon we're going to try to play a little bit of the special that they sang last night but we thank brother luis and sister christine for being over there with them and for them having a good representation of the church over there with the with the youth so that's where they're at today is there with the with the use also with the youth i will uh i'm going to fly to ohio uh tomorrow night and be there until thursday with them for a little while and have a little fellowship with them so just keep me in your prayers brother bob will be speaking here wednesday night then we will have the youth service next saturday at three o'clock and you need to get with sister jim today about the food because i think we're going to go ahead and have spaghetti again like we did because it's really simple really easy to have that and to have some salad and stuff like that so i think that's what we'll do again if that's all right with y'all i think it's the simplest thing to do there wasn't a lot to there wasn't a lot of stress and we're looking for a good time in the lord brother kidri diggs will be with us it's been a long time since he's been here but uh we pray that you're praying for the service amen so i think we're can you put that on there now anderson will is it going to go also remember that we're only have one service next sunday what's this one service next sunday that will be with brother diggs and also we will have foot washing that afternoon that will be the whole second service will be nothing but foot washing i'm sorry foot washing i'm thinking about all what i'm doing here sorry about that y'all just have to bear with me ta-da now we got it okay so we got that we're going to have a baptismal service next sunday afternoon we're going to set up the new baptistry and we're going to anybody that wants to be baptized i think we already have about five or six that are going to be baptized and re-baptized but we're going to do that next sunday after the first service we will have a baptismal service what we may do is go if anybody wants to go eat or we just may have it directly afterwards so we'll just talk about that we'll decide that next sunday it won't matter one way or the other but uh if you want to go get something deep maybe or we'll just start right into the second part of the service which will be a baptismal service and like i said there's five or six gonna be baptized um sister uh corinna will be here from ohio she's to get baptized along with some of the other ones that have expressed interest to being baptized and being baptized again it it it it's just a good conscious thing to do if you have if you don't know like i was baptized long time ago as a kid i really didn't know what i was doing i did it because i think somebody else had it somebody else got it but i want to do it make sure that i did it so i had brother dale do it again when i was older and we want to make that as a good conscience to the lord and something that the devil can't say well that person that baptized you is now in the world there's a lot of a lot of people that have been baptized that the message people person is not even the message anymore so to have a good conscience if you want to be baptized we're going to baptize anyone that wants to be baptized next sunday after the first service has everybody got that say ma'am all right also now june 18th will be the father's day fishing trip at the pond over at terrence and zach's uh we'll start about eight o'clock in the morning we'll have hamburgers hot dogs it'll be for the kids and for the boys and the men no girls allowed sorry it's father's day no girls allowed but we'll have a fishing and we'll have hamburgers and hot dogs there on the uh around the pond and just fellowship there on that saturday also july the 3rd remember brother chris long will be preaching for us our anniversary 51st anniversary meeting will be just on sunday we'll have two services on sunday and then we will eat a meal after that and we'll get together on all that i know that's a month or so away but i try to announce these so you can understand that we're having something later on in the month and make your plans for it also july the 22nd through the 25th we'll be going to ohio as i see now there's 42 people have signed up which is wonderful they about fell over in ohio because i told them maybe they won't be about 25 people show up so he's going to be 42 some are going to drive some are going to fly but we're going to um i called two trailway bus places and our charter bus places and um they can only drive 10 hours at a time so we'd have to stop get a motel have another day there another day back so we're just going to rent two vans and that puts 20. if we get two 15 passenger vans that's 29 people riding in the in van two vans so we'll do that and if you still want to go now if you don't want to go you need to let us know all right if you're not if you're still on this list and you don't want to go now that we've changed a little bit i know some of you wanted to get on the bus but that's okay because we'd have to leave a day early you'd have to pay a motel bill an extra two motel nights they just can't drive over 10 hours they can double up but it's it's way expensive to do that they have to send the driver 10 hours up put him in a motel and then he picks up and drives on and you gotta pay for that guy to come back here then you gotta do that when you come back so it's about fourteen hundred dollars extra to drive straight through so we can rent a couple of vans almost for that but if you still want to do it there's there's room if we have to get three we'll get three but we'll we'll work on that later on but just keep that in your heart we will leave sometime late thursday night or early friday morning it's a good 12 hour trip and then when we get finished monday we'll leave monday morning we'll have a youth service on saturday and then we'll have a one church service on sunday and then have fellowship afterwards so just keep that in your prayers and we're trying to look for some airbnb so that people can stay together and not have to be in a motel room so we're working on that uh there's not many big houses up there but they are on lake erie and they are really pretty so i'm trying to i'm working on that so maybe when i get up there this coming week uh that's probably one of the purposes i'm gonna go one of them is to check out the place in the facility and where we can stay and all that other stuff so but we will probably have a church service here that we can um and whoever's left behind i didn't want to say it like that but whoever's left will have a church service we talk about playing a tape but but maybe if if some are not going then we might just have a we just have a regular church service just keep that in your prayers so and also sister mary kamani sent a message i know some of you may have got it on whatsapp but her maids got the bad cold and now she has that same bad cold um her right hip is hurting and it hurts when she sits you know she's had that accident she's her desire is to get to church so we're just gonna pray that all that'll go away and she asks also for the healing of her mind because of anxiety when you have to sit around and your world's turned upside down you get anxious you get all you know light chest and you've got all the butterflies and all that stuff a lot of anxiety comes with that when your world gets turned upside down or wreck or accident or whatever else so let's just pray for her now and pray for the rest of the service let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day we pray now that number one you come here and speak to us today lord you be the speaker lord you be the one that gives revelation and lord as the word goes forth i pray that if anyone's sick in the building we know the sister mary commandees had a special request lord and we pray now that you'd send the holy spirit there with the healing power that we know it has inside of all of us that we send that to her lord that she'll be raised up for your honor and glory and the hip will stop hurting and the cold will go away and and her desire is to come to church lord and i pray that you just grant her that desire lord to keep her out of that anxiety it's just the devil you do not make people anxious it's the devil that makes people that way and devil you have no hold on that sister you've got you got bride here today praying for this one sister lord i prayed lord that you'd be with her bless her comfort the lord be with each one that's not here lord the ones that are sick the ones that are traveling brother louise sister christina and the and the young young adult over in in buford that should give them travel and mercies back lord we pray that you'd sanctify this in this journey we commit all things unto you in jesus name amen so let's turn to uh john 1 verse 1. we got it there on the screen so i'm going to try to be able to move this thing myself so they don't have to how about that john 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word where it was with god and the word was god in verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and he beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord as blessings to the reading of the word um i hope all of you oh i want to make it now i hope all of you sisters last sunday if you did not get a mother's day card if you did not get a mother's day card from the church you need to let brother terrence know or sister lisa know because that was a gift to you mothers and some of you i know weren't here but we want to make sure everybody gets a little gift from the church and make sure you thank brother and sister dale for providing that gift on mother's day amen a little thank you goes a long way you know brother brown and that guy was that brother branham was going one day he said that he said that guy just walked up to me and you could hear it in brother brown's voice he said he said that man walked up to me and said i don't need anybody to tell me thank you i don't need anybody to tell me a good sermon i don't need this he said brother brother brown said that man was lying every human being likes a good pat on the back every once in a while or a good sermon or attaboy or thank you for doing what you're doing and thank you for all this um that uh that you're doing for the people that you really didn't have to do but you did it out of the goodness of your heart so we need to make sure we're appreciative and give it back and thank thank brother and sister dale for doing that so so let's now romans 10 verse 8 says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in the heart the word of faith which we preach that if you confess shall confess without mouth to lord jesus and believe on thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved all right we're talking talk about just baby form salvation they're going to pull up the chart in just a second i think over on this side but i have i have this week i've kind of tried to pull it back a little bit so that we can all understand i don't want to run away from anybody but we got to understand we got to be born again we got to understand how and why and what's the uh what's the way how's the way there's been many ways brother brown told us 50 50-something years ago 60 years ago he said the new birth is the most ill-taught subject in christendom because one says it's this one says it's this one said i cried one said i shouted i quit chewing tobacco i quit doing this i quit drinking i quit that's not the new birth all right that's not the new birth amen the new birth is god personally coming to you and we'll talk about in just a minute and burning out not just softly oh he's going to come in is this soft no the kingdom of god is taken by force he's going to rip that thing out of you he's going to pull that thing out of you and he's going to kill it that old nature i'm talking about not your soul the nature that's attached to it because if it kills your soul you're dead and if god kills your soul you're in trouble all right that's gog that's way a long time from here because the only one that can kill a soul is the one that gave you soul man satan can't kill your soul he can pervert your soul enough though where god has to kill it amen righteous judge he can't stand evil thou shalt be saved for with the heart look for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation as we were talking last week and last saturday at the bible study if you'll compartmentalize all these things you'll understand it a lot better because once you get born again see where that bracket says son of god can you you don't see it from over there sorry we're going to leave it over there because i need to have this one over here technology but see where the bracket says son of god son of god and we'll read it in just a few minutes that was what god the new birth in the church ages everybody with me and that that group got the message of their time their little box they lived that message they lived that time period they lived the word of god for their day and they died and they were put in the sixth dimension because the son of god is what the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost but what is the son of man it's that holy ghost inside of a human being all right the son of man now don't get me wrong but the son of man has nothing to do with your new birth it does but it does you understand what i mean the understanding of the son of god puts you in the body of christ you come up in the first resurrection you don't have to stand the judgment you don't have to go through the tribulation period you get to live in the city your bride amen but those people have gone on and we'll read it in just a few minutes oh we'll read this afternoon if we get to it but that son of man at the top that that's something that's never been taught before that was jesus himself he was the son of man everybody with me all right so look christian walk of god is right here not down here you're still walking in flesh and walking in sin until you get born again then you come to the revelation not revelation of the son of god but it is a revelation that you're born again that god has given you the new birth and these virtues are going to now flow out of you if you'll let them but this is a special the headstone that's been what i've put special anointing over there that headstone was rejected so in other words it just disappeared in the church ages it was not taught it wasn't supposed to be taught in the church ages the prophet tells us that in the end time the bible tells us that the son of man is to come back in the end time just like he did when he walked the shores of galilee in a mini-membered body and that will be for a body change not for salvation not to make it in the rapture i've never taught that never will teach that you born again as look see that little baby shadow right there if you're born again today that's you today if you just started and that baby is going to make it in a rapture the first resurrection with all the other bride but you've got to have look you've got to have somebody to come to the wheat maturity to bring these people out of the ground to bring these people up they listen they without us cannot be made perfect so what's paul tell us he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ i'm going to read that real quick and then we'll skip through it leaving the principles of doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection everybody with me this is the epitome of perfection this is your body change this is only see how little it is only a small group of people is going to attain to that small group of people but it's but we have the ability to do it by the opening of the field by the opening of the word of god in the end time god has told us there will be a group of people that will stand and death will not be able to harm them that's what we're looking at therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on into perfection we were talking about this the other day not laying again the foundation of repentance we'll talk about that a little bit because you can't keep coming back to the foundation what if you walked out and built a house today but you you were going to build this great big house to live in and you built a foundation and you started setting up furniture what are you saying for that's what a lot of people do they get in the foundation and say well i live right here i'll start putting my and then the first time what first time the wind blows it's going to blow whatever you got sitting on that foundation but that foundation is for you to what build walls build a roof then put your furniture in build a wall a living moving breathing instrumentality of god the prophet of god said build the house you're starting down here but build the house give something for this to reside in because if not you're going to be tossed yes by every wind of doctrine as the bible tells us of the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands under the resurrection of the dead of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permit first corinthians 13 9 says for we know in part we prophesy in part but that which is perfect son of man was perfect was he not i know some of them came to certain parts of perfection but the son of man was perfect and then if that son of man is supposed to come back in the end time and come inside of me and you in its fullness it makes us perfect thank you very much then that which is part shall be done away with not done away you can't look you can't say all right i built a house let's rip the foundation out from under it what's going to happen brother john house going to fall house is going to fall no matter how good you built all this up here if you leave that foundation it'll be fine but if you want to take that foundation out from under the house when i was a child i spoke to the child brother bob was preaching my sermon today it's all right they get you in the mindset maybe get you in the same furrow i understood as a child i thought as a child it's not bad to be a child it's actually really good to be a child look at all the things we do for a baby starts crying what's the first thing we do almost the whole church goes looking what what what do they need but now if josh starts crying back there unless the lord attacks him pretty good if he just starts crying and say i need my mama we're gonna pay me attention half the church gonna turn around and say what grow up stop crying back there but i put away childish things in other words i put the xbox up now listen if you like to play xbox and you're 50 years old that's okay but it's a waste of time i didn't get any mans from those that still have xboxes but you don't need a lot of discernment when people are going but what does that mean it means brought to an end or finished that's what i like this is why we have to come to perfection because it will end in the dispensation of just being born again and living for god because see the son of god revelation is these virtues the revelation of the son of god we'll get into it this afternoon brother brown said these virtues without the holy ghost is a stumbling block to the believer why because you got to start at the foundation you got to start down here and that's what we're going to start on we had a little bit the other night but we'll kind of go on a little bit more today if that's all right brought to an end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness perfect that which is perfect consummate human integrity and virtue full grown adult a full age a finisher a perfecter one who has in his own person raised faith to its perfection and so set before us the highest example of faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen that's down here at faith but that faith never listened that if that's it faced the foundation it never leaves you it's going to take more faith though to be here than it is here it's going to take a lot more faith to be here than is here and faith is the substance of things hoped for we're hoping for a body change but it's an evidence that there's going to be one amen because that faith is there it's the fish in the water which one was first the water was there so the fish can get in it look at the days of creation ephesians 4 11 said he gave some apostles how are we going to get this brother away well he'd give it he give us he give us these people a prophets apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ is everybody okay i'm not getting you drunk by reading that am i it makes me where i can get through it a little bit faster till we all come to the unity of faith all come to the what unity not division not i can't stand this person and this person doesn't mean this no we got to talk about brother kindness a little bit later on it's easy to let people love you love somebody that literally hates your guts and of the knowledge of the son of god into a perfect man until see that's son of god son of god didn't say son of man because when you come to son of man revelation you've had a lot of teaching from pastors prophets teachers evangelists and all the different five folk ministries and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more foundation babies tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lying wait to deceive so lit folks they're out there they're out there satan is out there to deceive satan is right here in your mind right now i'm trying to deceive you amen but speaking the truth in what love not filial love agape love love that doesn't have feeling and emotion to it oh wait a minute nope doesn't feel love has feeling and emotion and that's what we have to filter agapa love through because we're humans we can't have agape love without the new birth like brother brown said feel your love somebody strikes your wife you'll kill him agape love you'll pray for him big difference which is the head even christ may grow up into him in all things from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted every sunday and every wednesday listen to the tape boy sometimes it hurts it hurts to be compacted but you know what it keeps everything together and whichever joint supplies according to the effects you're working what's he talking about he's talking about a body he's talking about a body joints he's talking about every joint well if you didn't have a joint what would you be you couldn't be a statutor you'd be a statue if you had no joints some of them some people probably wish the joint that's up under my ears didn't work very well but boot devil god made me this way maketh the increase of the body into the edifying of itself in love and that's agape love not feeling love so that word there means adult age maturity suitable age for anything come on devil anything if you're mature enough you'll be able to handle it if you're not you're going to yield just like i'm going to talk about that nature today you're going to yield to the devil every time amen 100 without the new birth you're going to yield to that old nature i don't know about y'all but is it just me maybe things i used to do i do them no more but it's not that i don't think about them amen let's be real we're not message zombies suitable aids for anything metaphorically of an attained state fit for a thing something that's what this is talking about me and you today it's not talking about the world it's fit for this thing called the bride the perfection is going to come no one else is going to come to perfection except the bride of jesus christ only the bride of jesus christ is going to come to perfection first corinthians 14 19 says yet in the church i'd rather speak five words here's paul five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others now not just to speak them that's right i got a quote on my region this afternoon where brother brown talks about remember the first sermon he preached what he said man he said i preached the sermon he said brother dr david said brother brown that's the worst sermon i ever heard he said yeah but everybody in the church was crying he said they cried funerals they cried burst he said you didn't say anything about the word of god and i think that's the way we got it now if you're crying if you weep a little bit it's okay but what are you saying bring the word of god let me shout about what you're going to say the preacher don't have to shout about you shout about what i'm saying if it's the word of god if it's not then sleep on that by my voice i might teach others also than 10 000 words in an unknown tongue brethren be not children in understanding you know why he said that because the previous verse people children without understanding are going to head toward this emotional side every time oh he made me cry oh he made me shout no he didn't make you do it you did it because that's all you need to do what does a baby do a baby cries because that's all it knows to do but now as an adult you have emotions to cry laugh not say anything take the word of god and grow up i be the mouths be children but in understanding be men that's what we all need to come to understanding not the understanding of man the understanding of god to not be children anymore in the law it is written with men and other tongues and other lips will i speak unto the people and yet for all that they will not hear me saith the lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying service not for them that believe not but for them which believe in other words the preaching of the word of god is god telling you what he's already said about you so he's prophesying of a group of people and to a group of people first corinthians two verse nine says but it is written eye has not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that have agape love amen amen may i say that but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god if you have the baptism of the holy ghost today there is something that draws you higher if it's not you're not born again you just got a feeling you just got an emotion i'll come to church when i can no no we're way past that see we don't have to sit here and judge people people that just show up every once in a while and don't come back second service don't show up on wednesday night you ain't born again you ain't born again get born again cause they some born again people come to church every sunday every wednesday that's when the board again people come to church the ones that are not born again come to church when they want to if it hits you right between eyes you need a new birth and that's all you just said it's just simple as that why are you talking about me ain't talking about you talking about the devil's inside of you getting you to do that stuff because it searches all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit that's in him that's what i was just saying we can tell the spirit that's in people by the things that they do and the way that they act sure we have all our little intricacies that that i may not like you know music and but i like hunting that ain't got nothing to do with the word of god that's humanity but when it comes down to the word of god if you're doing these things you're not born again if you're doing these things it shows that at least you're trying to get born again if you're not already you're trying to get born again but just listen folks everybody in this building has been in the message at least two or three years i'm looking around just to make sure if you don't know for a fact that coming to church is a duty of a christian you are deceived you need to get born again well i got this bro tom falbush he used to come and i'm gonna tell it that okay donny brother tom falbush had a problem with going to the restroom number one he wore a catheter and made his own bag and tied it to his leg he was here every single service and you can't make it because your cat gets cross-eyed every once in a while come on come on people it's time to grow up if you don't come to church you ain't born again if you don't have a desire if it doesn't say hey i've got to go not that i i want to do this this is something in my heart well i've got you can get all kind of excuses that wasn't in my notes but you get you got it anyway because what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man which in him you know what take a guy that's in the world he's got a spirit in him you you stay around him long enough you'll find out what that spirit is same way with a christian supposed to be because look even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god because without the holy ghost you can't understand god you just come into church because somebody told you to now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god so there's a spirit that we have that we didn't have before everybody with me we're going to try to get into it if we don't we'll get to it this afternoon but we talk about that stony heart and brother brown talks about god giving you a new spirit it's not the holy spirit everybody with me but he does give you a new spirit to start coming see that's what i'm back at one more time in sanctification you should want to come to church all the time just in sanctification because the unclean spirit goes out you want to come to church not the new well i come to church now every sunday because of the new birth no you don't you might know why but you should come to church and sanctification because brother brown says your name goes on the book is a believer you become religious right but it's a hard one to stay at though because satan will make you deceived and set you in a church and tell you that everything's okay and you're all right and you ain't got to understand what the preacher says that's hogwash i just told you what it said right here the spirit is what if you have the holy ghost and it's down there at the bottom it's it don't want to stay a baby so who makes it stay a baby we do now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which stings look which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the nature of man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god we'll talk about that in just a few minutes the nature the natural man you were born with an adamic nature you were born with a nature sinful you can't help it because you were born in sin that's why you were put on free moral agency and god gave you a choice to make that's right we'll talk about the age of accountability maybe in just a few minutes but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for their foolishness to him i tell some of you now oh i really don't have to come to church i'm in the message i can watch online the bible says for satan that's assembling of yourself together i know there's some cane i know there's some that live a long way and i know some that are older and that's fine but if you're healthy i'm going to use the tom fall bush if you've got a catheter wrapped around your leg and you you want to be in church you'll be in church god will make a way for you to do that because i know that probably 90 percent of this the people sitting here today did not know brother tom had that every service he was here every service even on wednesday night he had to go back there and empty that bag but he came to church and you know what he's in glory right now because he did what god asked him to do you come to church you do what you're supposed to do and i'll make you a child of god because if we don't have the spirit of god in us we're what it's foolishness to us when i was out in the world when you were out in the world it was foolish to want to come to church don't get quiet on me neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned listen when you get the baptism of the holy ghost you become a spiritual person in god now you're a spiritual person now but you get the new birth it moves you over to new desires but remember we're predestinated not just to get born again we're predestinated to grow to adoption we're predestinated and we are being pulled up that pyramid by the holy ghost it's up there on the very top right there that's what you get the new birth here you get the new birth here it cannot do anything but pull you up so if you're not being pulled to grow you don't have the new birth down here amen i wish we'd look at ourselves in the face every once in a while say am i really doing right am i really born again or am i just sitting in the church and oh there's some good preachers in this church ain't no doubt but you can sit here and go to hell with five good preachers in this church so the son of man ministry just to get before we get started on the stages of adoption because remember you can't be adopted without being a son so we're going to get to this and we're going back way up right to the birth but when we look at this chart and i don't i i thought that i simplified it but maybe i didn't but but the new birth gets you in the body then the verse you start working through you and then the holy spirit seals it in because you're what you've come to adoption all right then the son of man ministry comes on the scene and caps that off in other words sits down on top of that and you're fully connected that's for your body change not for your new birth the son of god is the new birth everybody with me all right now we're looking at the chart and remember adoption is not your birth so it's not we got to pull this apart now put the next one up please brother the one that we've been dealing with and i wanted that in its fullness makes you a christian amen a son and daughter of god right there that's what makes you a christian everybody with me all right not not that i i no everything is in that though the life of that plant that you plant in the ground remember you plant it it get roots it's got to be established and then what does it do you go out there and say man i got corn up now this tall i think i'll just cut it off well it's corn well potentially it's corn it has the ability to put ears on the stalk but it's got to go through one stage two stages three stages and then that's got to lay in the sun to ripen all the virtues is everybody with me all right that's pretty good so we know that there's three stages of adoption and it has to start with your birth romans 8 verse 14 says minions are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god everybody writing me doing this and this was worked out pretty good but you have not received the spirit of bondage to forget to fear listen you're in bondage until you're born again no i'm free i can do all i want to do i can do everything you're bound you're bound because when you do get born again you look back and say that wasn't freedom i was bound i was bound but now i'm free for you have not received the spirit of a mind of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption what a new nature a new spirit that's motivating you to do the things of god not the things of the devil right we'll get to that in just a second but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry abba father our father father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit so you have a spirit amen the holy spirit bears witness that we are the children of god all right children of god look children of god and if children then heirs heirs of what all that that was up there when the first one all that up through there every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse how are you going to know that though if you're not born again some of you heard me up at brother jules you got to have the as brother brown said you got to have the heart of the composer before you can read the sheet music you got to have some some kind of ability i mean i look at these notes and and they mean absolutely nothing to me a flat b flat b i know there's a seed whatever you start with the letter c right c is the middle key i knew that but other than that i don't understand because what there's not a spirit in me to play an instrument but if there's a spirit inside of me to play an instrument i'd know what that says so guess what when you read the word of god and you're not a christian it doesn't mean as much to you as if you're born again and read the word of god but look it's okay to be a child that's where you got to start and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ where was where was i loved the picture of brother branham i mean a picture of the bride they got one with the bride up here but they got one with jesus standing here with the hoffman's head at the top because that is who that is that's who we got to emulate no we got to be that but now it's not going to be real fun if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together you got to have a nature change because if you don't have a nature change i said before you're always going to go back the other way without a nature change you're going to always go back the other way always going the other direction all right why because you were born contrary to god so if you're born contrary to god it's like brother i'm talking about the the shooting of the of the gun how you can't ever get that bullet trajectory back right until you come all the way back and start at the foundation start at the blade in the front the two blades in the front and one blade in the back and when you line them up then you can shoot that bullet and it'll go right to the target but if you're off an inch here you'll be off 50 inches 200 yards away because it just continually going away that's why i'm telling you stay in church you say why do i have to go how many people have been successful not going to church they ain't a christian in the world that'll tell you it's better to stay at home than it is go to church if he's a real born-again christian you really have to never ask that question it's the weak ones you have to ask that question to i'm sorry we all some we have weaknesses we all do but we ought to be over this coming to church business you get born again you'll come to church well i'll make it when i can i need the spirit of god and the worst thing in the world is when you start getting in trouble what's the first thing that you do you disappear from church that's foolish that's absolutely the most foolish thing you can do is if you start having problems in yourself what does satan want to do divide and conquer he wants to keep you away from it because you just might get the holy ghost if you hang around holding those filled people amen hey listen you hang around drunks out when you're in the bar what's the first thing you did you got drunk because the environment you were in made you act that way so let's come to church and get drunk on the holy ghost let it change your life every once in a while so now let's look at justification let's start with this bottom one down here but what sayeth that the word is nightly even in thy mouth and in the heart that is the word of faith which we preach saith thou shalt confess with our mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved there's millions and billions of people that have come to that place but they stay there they stay there and brother brown says if you die right then you're going to go to heaven now he doesn't call you bride you will not be bright you will go to heaven though because your past sins has been chopped off you've done what the word said to do but now listen everybody in the sound of my voice that's still awake you don't have that option you've not been taught that way amen amen you do it you're not born again you're just doing a lot of ignorance and you're doing it because satan's getting you to do that for with the heart just talking to somebody the other day for with the heart that's where you believe you believe in your heart if your heart wants to do something and in justification let's simplify it right here i'll read it in just a minute it just chops off your past sins it gets you to a place to where you said i'm done it's like brother uh luis it's all about my i'm tired of this thinking thinking i'm tired of the place that i'm in you know who is that that's god because satan is never going to tell you you're not in the right place you need to be unless you're out in the world doing the things but i'm talking about coming into a religious environment or a christian environment if you feel uncomfortable then you need to get the new birth okay for when the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation how's that romans 3 verse 24 says being justified freely by his grace we'll get into that a little bit later on going up the statue of a perfect man through the redemption that is in christ jesus watch whom god has set forth to be a what perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past you cannot get forgiven i we heard a preacher one time praying to god to forgive his future sins can't do that that's catholicism i'm sorry and then the man turned out to turn the message down just saying but you can't get forgiven lord forgive me tomorrow i know i'm going to do it i'm not saying no i'm going to do it so forgive me no no get born again that's our theme get bored again but you get remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god but it's from your heart to declare i say thee at this time his righteousness is not yours because you know what you can justify yourself and be wrong but god can't justify you and be wrong and you'd be wrong if god justifies you those who is justified he is already glorified he said to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in jesus you've started in baby form justification you you know what you're not going to forget those sins but god did remember i talk about the sea of god's forgetfulness and don't go fishing there's a no fishing sign don't go fishing in the sea of forgetfulness uh-uh what do we do first thing we do we go well i'm doing this because now if you're truly justified you stand clean before god at this moment now remember though the unclean spirit has not left you you're going to continue as the prophet of god says you're going to continue to do if you were a thief you're still going to continue to steal that's a hard thing for people to see but in justification it all it does it chops off your past sins it gets you in a place to where god can soften you get ready to soften you up and start dealing with you all right where is boasting then it is it excluded so forget the boasting part well bless god he chopped off my past then so i'm just going to get another truckload of them god knows your heart and unless you really are repentant he ain't going to forgive those past sins because you really didn't mean it you're doing it with a motive that's off the word of god so the lord watch but the lot by the law of faith therefore we conclude paul we conclude this that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law do's and don'ts you can't get clean under the law once a year the priest took the blood sprinkled it went inside the holy of holies sprinkled it come back out says okay our sins are not done away with they're covered until next year we gotta do the same thing again and that's why paul says don't don't make the blood of jesus christ like that that you got to come in and out every every year you got to go in and out every year like i said before one more time get born again i won't take care of all your problems but i promise you it will help you deal with them justified freely first stage of justification chopped off your past sins unclean spirit's still there everybody with me we need to go through this because we got some young ones that are here now let's go to sanctification matthew 12 43 says when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man oh here we go we're fixing to change something here we're fixing to change an attitude because when the unclean spirit goes out of a man he walketh through dry places seeketh rest and findeth none then he sayeth who the devil the unclean spirit so that's not the holy spirit right everybody with me it's not always prayer it's unclean spirit when he goes out of a man he walks and drives places and when he look watch this then he says i will return into my house he's still got possession on you amen brother brown said he was a squatter he doesn't own the title deed but he's a squatter there's a difference in possessing something and being a tie having a title deed you can possess a piece of property until that owner stands up walks in and says i own this thing get off my land a lot of that happens overseas they have a lot of places people will go to the united states and they'll have a piece of property and they'll come back about six months later and somebody's already built a shack on it well they possess whatever's there but they don't own the ground so that's what satan done through the fall in the garden he has possessed me and you he's a possessor all right then he says i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he finds it empty swept and garnished this person we'll talk about in just a minute maybe if we get to it this person has decided to start doing things different things and let me give you an example of that when you come to sanctification that unclean spirit has gone out it's an unclean spirit so you start getting a little different attitude and i'm just telling you what happened to me the unclean spirit's still there out there all right you don't throw it out there it just god just takes it and you do what you come to church that's what i said before people in this message and in different denominations says oh you just believe the message you shout speak in tongues you've got to be in the message because you're sitting in a message church that's a lie of the devil live the devil what have you done in 10 15 20 years have you grown anyone no i i just i can't get i still cry a lot stunted growth come on people then go with him and take it with himself seven more spirits more wicked than himself more religious than himself and they enter in because there's not a cap being put on it there's not a seal been put on it so the water can get out or we'll get back in one of the two and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation is it so i know i got the new birth because no if you fall under a real true a work of the holy ghost of sanctification that's when all that junk goes out that's when all that goes away but then what's going to happen if you don't have a tie post if you don't have a spiritual rudder yes what's gonna happen is your vessel that you thought you could control come on somebody that you thought you could control the first wind it blows where is it going to blow you right back at where you were before right back out there but with that rudder that you have it doesn't matter if the wind blows listen it might be sideways we come flying into uh me and dad went bear hunting and we was in this little crop duster wasn't very much about 12 people on the plane but they come flying into wherever we were in new brunswick canada and i couldn't see the runway because it was so little i could i was sitting on the first seat and i went no further from here to um sister zoe from the pilot no door there that's how little that plane was and i could look out the window with him and there they're flying the plane and the yokes are turned this way you know what i'm talking about the yolk's supposed to be this way when you're landing on a straight runway i look outside brother john i see pine trees and i happen to look this way where the engine was i see the runway i'm like i hope we're gonna make another pass but what was the crosswind was like 30 miles an hour and they were running into that crosswind and just right before we hit the runway that yo was like right before we hit the runway he turned it and said it right now why because he had control he had a rudder so the winds can blow you every which way it wants to blow you but look they had their mind on that runway and when they hit that runway they were right on that white line why because they were skilled pilots they had grown up past the baby stage now what if a baby had been sitting in that seat we had to hit the pine trees but a skilled pilot was on board a skilled pilot will get you where you're going same thing with the word of god second timothy 2 19 says nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal that the lord knoweth them that are his let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity depart from doing what you used to do that's sanctification not the new birth don't dwell on that because like i said before you don't have a rudder you will go back to where you were before but in a great house there's not only vessels of gold silver wood and earth some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore what purge himself from these he be he shall be a vessel of honor sanctified and meet for the master's use what is sanctification cleaned and set aside for service not in service compound word greek word cleaned and set aside for service not put in service and meet for the master's use and prepared into every good work listen there's a lot you got to do in these two stages because it is a work of the holy ghost but you know what it's doing it's going against your nature let me just say this just a few minutes we may not get nowhere but it goes against your nature we're not forgiving people when we're not born again hello somebody we're not very forgiving people people in the world that's their problem now they can't forgive things that happen hundreds of thousands 200 500 years ago they cannot get it out of their head but if you're a christian go go don't even worry about those things paul said in other words throwing those things that are passed out of the way let's go on to perfection and let's just walk no he said run and finish the race let's run now listen now watch judas iscariot swallow was justified by faith and believed on the lord jesus christ and was baptized let me ask you a question yeah everybody believed brother brown was the prophet right we believe what well some of you do i don't know what the wrestling i'll do in this building there's another church right over the under the bible said jesus baptized the disciples his disciples all right saint john 17 17 says before he could send them out he said sanctify them so judas was what justified and sanctified amen sanctify them father through thy truth thy word is truth and he was the word even before the atonement was made in other words as a preview father of my shed blood i'm going to sanctify these he gave them power against unclean spirits this is how an anointed one can work in the end time he can be given power to preach the gospel pray for the sick raise the dead preach the gospel and just be sanctified so when one thing comes along satan comes along guess what he goes back that way because he can't go this way he's got to go out of the message you can't stand the message he give them power against unclean spirits and they went out and they cast out devils of that right and they healed the sick is that right and they came back sanctified which we would consider the new birth by old teaching right brother can preach like a lark i'm telling you i heard a sermon from a brother that preached the millennium better than i've heard anybody preach the millennium got a lot and still got notes from it mostly in my head and he was sleeping with a 14 year old girl preaching a message y'all pretty much know pretty much who he is while he was doing that all that preaching all that good preaching so that don't mean deadly squat watch the life but they came back sanctified rejoicing jumping shouting and praising god if that's true some of y'all are not even sanctified just saying is that right and they said even the devil is subject to us jesus said don't you rejoice because the devil is a subject to you but rejoice because your names are written in the book of heaven is that right and judah says carrot was with them one of them called out sanctified he went to church i don't think he ever missed a service that'll tell you something and his name written in the lamb's book of life but remember not the eternal section because your name can be removed everybody with me read matthew 10 and see if that's not right he called each one of them and judas and every one of them right down there he sent them out gave them power against unclean spirits so let's not put our i'm born again because anymore no you're sanctified and you know what you can be sanctified and be a real good person but somewhere like i said before there's a wind going to blow through your life and it's going to blow you right back to where you were i hope this is hitting home how's the thing this this is 1955 a hidden life in christ how the thing was refreshed in the presence notice another thing once in the presence of god you get quiet why you get quieted it's kind of contrary to some of these meetings we've been doing huh you're not tossed about by everything you know where you're standing i'd rather know where i'm standing like paul said five words five words of revelation truth then to have all the shouting you can ever have but there's a time when you need to be shouting at you what you got that is the truth amen you know where you're standing there something happens you know that you're a real christian you know that you've been in contact with somebody that loves you you know that something happened down here and it's refreshing and not only that but you'll refresh others you seen people that was nice people but you couldn't hardly stand to be around them there's something about them they got a creative power around them that just seems to be different how i'd like to stop here now if if brother brown stopped you need to listen to this it's like jeet listen he's not jesus christ but when he says that it's kind of like jesus saying very rarely listen listen fix and tell you something how i'd like to stop here if i was possible if it was possible tell you something on that you're a little creator yourself now here he talks about we're talking about sanctification real quick right here and then we'll close we'll get to the rest this afternoon he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in him but the thing god has to do now look in sanctification not here not here when he's not talking about the holy ghost he's talking about sanctification there's many things to be said about sanctification your name goes on the book is a believer you become religious you start coming to church you start reading your bible [Music] things i used to do i do them no more like i was telling somebody the other day brother brown how can i quit being selfish he said just do the opposite just do the opposite no brother brother brother i got to get a prayer cloth and i got to get him i got him he said just do the vice versa when i want to go hunting deer i go to the woods now if i'm confused and i want to go hunting deer i'm going to open that door up right there and i'm going to just watch highway 52 i mean 23. and every once in a while maybe in about i have seen one down at the end of the road maybe in about 25 or 30 years a deer may come by right that's what satan is telling you about the world stay right here it's coming no you go hunting in a different spot same way in sanctification if you go to the bars quit going to the bars if you listen to what is it ryan christian rock croc music if you listen to that stuff get away from it do the vice versa you'll be surprised at what station you turn on the radio will help your spirituality say oh brother well do something quit listening to rap music quit listening to country music that talks about your drunk mama and your three four wives that's what i couldn't understand when i was growing up they talk about um you know kiss and all them other rock heavy metal rock bands it talks about drugs and and sex and alcohol and that's just so bad but now let's listen to country music all country music was was d-i-v-o-r-c-e and my mama got drunk and went to prison and it's all bad even some of this christian junk they're trying to put down our throat it's bad too but i'll tell you one thing listen to the words because sometimes the words can be anointed just forget about who's saying them toby michael whoever's saying the different things they're doing the best they can with what they got but listen to the words the words are inspired all right i don't know why i got onto that look watch this he gives you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you wow now if i believe brother brown was the prophet right okay i'm just reading you what he said about sanctification or he couldn't even live with you so he has to get you fixed up first i like that good old kentucky english he's got his uh no offense um our northern brethren and sisters so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in i'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so you can entertain him right wow now how can you entertain god in a bar how can you entertain god playing rap music how can you entertain god cussing the whole time that's what i'm telling you sanctification is the place that we need to realize where we're at and then move on through that and not say that's the new birth and settle down right here and don't get anything else from god because remember that unclean spirit that brother brown's talking about that went out all that's coming back if you don't get it sealed it'll be all right just a few more minutes and then we'll start right here this afternoon so that's when you're on the first altar but when you hide away you get his spirit then the holy spirit none other than god himself comes and dwells in you and then there's something about you the neighbors love you the people like you let's listen to this first peter one verse two elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through what sanctification of the spirit what is sanctification clean and set aside for service and we're going to continue up because the statute of perfect man is what cleaned and set aside for service all right even though you're already in service as a believer there's other things you've got to do through the sanctification of the spirit unto obedience brother wave when you become obedient at sanctification not at the new birth you become obedient at sanctification that's what i'm telling you if you don't come one more time if you don't come to church but half the time you're not even sanctified it's time to wake up spiritually and physically because this thing's gonna the door's gonna shut on this thing and you go what where'd i miss it god's gonna tell you where you miss it you missed it by not being in church because you know what if you want to i've just i've not had a visitation from god in so long you ain't been a church i thought he said where two or three are gathered in his name he'd be right here in the midst so if you want to meet where god is there's a there's a number down well it's not on the door now but used to that at ten o'clock and at two o'clock that's when god shows up here and seven o'clock on wednesday night if you miss it then you'll miss your visitation from god i know we can't be here all the time but you know what some of you just don't come but you're a believer yeah you believe in something obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace and peace and you be multiplied let's read this right here before musicians get ready to come i love this little sermon called intervale in sturgis michigan god prophesied through the prophet and said i will write my laws in their heart where i put them in the tables of their heart showing that that would be the dwelling place of god in the human heart not the human head but the human heart amen i will write them in my heart in their heart and they'll keep my statutes and so forth this is the sanctification we're supposed to keep the statues god sent in another place over in ezekiel said i will in that day take out your old fleshly stony heart and i'll give you a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you now a lot of people even you pentecostal people a lot of times get mistaken in that you get a new spirit that's not god's spirit that's you that isn't god you get a little happy because you get a new spirit and you jump up and down and run around on the floor maybe and shout a little bit speak in tongues everybody still believe brother brown with the prophet i'm reading health it's not my words it's his and thank you god the holy ghost that's not it that's a new spirit god gave you amen that's right that's you then after he give you your spirit then he said i'll put my spirit that's what's the matter with the missed meal cramps you get today that's right that's the reason you can't get nowhere with god what grow you can't grow with these virtues without having god in your heart notice you put a new spirit god has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him amen you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen i will put a new spirit in them and i will put my spirit in them he said after he's given you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with god's spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the holy spirit if he ever gives it to you so it's not automatic because you and your condition never get along what with god you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband you can't get along with your neighbor how are you ever going to get along with god so he has to give you a new spirit before you can even get along with him so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit in you gives you a new spirit a new outlook that's what i mean if you don't have a new outlook you're not even sanctification a new outlook a new faith a new faith to what not have faith in the world have faith in god then he puts his holy spirit in you and that's what we'll talk about this afternoon we'll start with the baptism of the holy ghost let's stand our feet god bless you hope i'm not been too hard but i want to nail this thing down before we even get up talking about the virtues because like i just said and i'll read the quote this afternoon without the holy ghost the virtues are a stumbling block to the believer to people that look around you and all these different things because they see you doing this and you claim to be a christian they see you doing this over here cheat lie still out on the late fishing on sunday that's when you usually meet your neighbor did i say that that's usually when you meet your neighbor and he's going to go aren't you supposed to be in church because he's not he don't claim to be anything but you claim to be something then you're out there whatever listen take a vacation do whatever you want to do that's fine i don't i don't advoc advocate you coming to church every sunday you know that but i swear just because you don't come that you ain't got you know what i'm saying you're not sanctified if you don't have an excuse and what an excuse is an excuse if you take a vacation that's fine i don't don't bother god i don't think brother i i was thinking the other day i was listening to a tape or something and anyway from that tape in september or october brother brown said i'm going hunting with the with the boys or the men we're going hunting out in arizona wherever he went and it was like three weeks later before his next sermon that was taped so he went hunting he said we're going hunting that's why when they asked him you know about going to church he said now if you're way out there in the woods and you ain't got a church to go to he said keep on hunting because i'm not saying he did but i'm telling you there was a gap of three weeks he didn't preach on a tape when he went hunting during october november he always went there and he had it he had a deer hunting um what do you call it he just had a whole lineup of going hunting with the brothers so i'm not an advocate of you having to do that but you know what i'm i'm not also not an advocate that well why didn't you come to church and i had one guy tell me because we just wanted to take a sunday off that one sunday you take off maybe the day the rapture takes place and uh guess what god's gonna take born again people home he's not gonna take people with sanctification home only with the new birth is he gonna take you in the rapture sanctified you might become a foolish virgin and you might be so fooled you're not even a virgin not even a foolish virgin amen sorry about that but i'm not really let's sing a song just sing one verse brother joe is 12 o'clock already [Music] the water show my soul [Music] today [Music] desire and i love to worship thee for you i alone are my strength my shield to you alone does my spirit you all alone are my hearts desire is that your desire your heart's desire to be around people brown believers and doing their belief what believers do that's where we draw strength as christians we don't draw strength from the world if you draw strength from the world then you're just of the world we drink from the right fountain i want you more than any other so much more than anything saying to him for you alone are my strength my shield to you alone does my spirit you you alone are my hearts desire and i love to worship thee [Applause] you know i'm sorry i'm spending so much time but you know the foundation if you ask billy gary krantz what's the what's the what's the to make sure the house is being built right to make sure it's going to last and stand you spend a lot of time on that foundation and you know what it's kind of messy you got to dig down deep on one side it may be unlevel it may be that you've got a poor footing and that footing's got to be so thick it's got to be so deep why because all that pressure of that house is going to sit right down on that foundation everything you build on top is sitting on that foundation and if it's what built on shifting sand it'll move where's brother aaron i can't remember we were going across they were building a new bridge and you could hear it from a long way off have you ever heard that thing it's driving that that um uh i-beam and they're driving it through the water into the mud and they're they gotta pound on it until it hits solid rock because think about a bridge with so much water running by and and all the different traffic and everything's shaking they sat there it'd be nerve-wracking if i had to listen to that all day but you know what once it gets to the bottom it goes because what is hit rock and that's what's god doing to me and you make sure that foundation is right bang bang every sunday every wednesday every time you pray every time you read your bible every time you study every time you talk to the brethren it's god pounding what compacting so that we make sure that when we start building that bridge that you're not going to fall i read the scripture a couple of sundays ago if you get these things put in you you'll never fall didn't say you wouldn't fail we fail every day but you'll never fall you about your building will never collapse if you build it right the first time that's what i want us to do make sure from this point on that we built the house right we've got the right foundation and that we've got the right tools to go where we need to go that's another thing you have to have the right tools to build with and it did come from i know when i worked with with um brother joe's dad it was hammering nails man you had to have you had your little belt with all the nails in it you had a hammer and you had a big hammer the big for the big nails and the smaller hammer for the little nails and man your arm and your wrist brother george had a wrist buddy you don't ever grab a hold of him he'd grab a hold of you buddy why because he built 20 houses a year and this is all he did well you know what now brother gary how many times you do that not very many you know why don't you let air do it why because we progressed in revelation it's okay to build a house with a hammer but it's built quicker when you use technology and you put that house together and that's the same way with god god is going to build us up the right way if we have the right foundation dear heavenly father we thank you for this day that you give us i pray that you forgive us of our sins and our mistakes that we make against you lord i pray father that you would anoint every one of us lord as our goal from the first of this year is to let it out whatever it is lord we need to let it out let it be displayed and if we if we find out that it's the devil then we can do something about it we can expose him we can make it so uncomfortable that he'll want to leave this house and father to the lord the the sweetness of the holy spirit we know that that you reside in our heart lord and it's a sweet smelling savior lord it's something that we can live with and even as the prophet said even in sanctification you give us a you take that old hard spirit out and you start softening us up lord so that you can put your holy spirit inside of us father be with us as we go eat a bite lord that you'll bring us together back at two o'clock we ask you to be with each one be with sister mary come on you again lord and touch our body lord as we pray in jesus name amen you're dismissed oh for you are my strength my shield to you all alone does my spirit desire and i love to worship you [Music] i want you more than you
