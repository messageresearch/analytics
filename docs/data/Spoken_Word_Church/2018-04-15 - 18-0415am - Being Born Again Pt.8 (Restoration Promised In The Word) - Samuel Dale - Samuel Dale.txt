we committed to you now remember each one remember sister Trudy's our Lord reach down touch her and her having a lot of problems let everything be alright and the baby okay we love you and we thank you in Jesus name now we keep on reading from the first Peter and then eventually we're going to get into second Peter said eventually but I don't know okay so we go to verse 18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation or your manner of life and things you know received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who've early was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that's your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned that means white-hot as far as you can go with it you know that desire in your heart should be that away and the love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently what being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever take let's go to Joel 1 and world will just universal will use verse forward in Grover's chapter 2 that was the palmer worm had left at the locusts eaten and that which the locust had left has the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm has left half the caterpillar eaten all right now we go to 2 and then we you know we pick up our thought from that 2 and 23 be glad in your children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will come cause to come down for you the rain the former and the latter rain in the first month now remember how in the world could that be it's got to be a spiritual but it's a natural looking at it how can you have former and latter how can you plant and then within one month so that means something's got to happen you got to change the natural story of planning and thing you can't keep the natural story to come for you got to go then into the spiritual because it's got to be a rain falling in quickening right at the same time all right so we'll get to that eventually and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and all and I will restore to you the years that the locust and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Plumber weren't my great army which I sent among you then you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word remember what I always say when I read that Scripture because you'd say well look at our God sent these things among us no God permitted the things to come among us he did not send no locusts caterpillar etc etc he permitted it to take place so that it would be you know for our benefit all right now we've been talking about restoration then we went into some things talking of how the restoration deals only with that which has been here originally all right now that to me is a very valuable valuable thing to follow in a line through the Bible and to think of it alright there's things in the Bible that have not been here before they will be a time for it to come forth alright now it can be prophesied through the Bible but there has to be a time to come to that okay now as an example you've had the prophecies throughout the Bible of the millennial reign right but the millennial reign see is not a restoration because it's never been here before but it's been prophesied through the word and we'll come to pipes because it's do it that's the form of what I'm trying to lay down in your mind to keep you to thinking about is that the things that we talk about well this has got to be restored that's got to be restored there was a lot of things that had to be restored the new birth was never eaten away you can't bring forth the new birth and let it be taken away in any age or any time it cannot be you would leave that aged without the new birth you would leave them without eternal life so that can not be so the Holy Ghost was never eaten away the word was what was eaten away all right now the Holy Ghost can only work I want you to make sure and get this point the Holy Ghost can only work through the amount of word that you receive right now as I've Illustrated over and over to you so you've got a hundred and twenty in the upper room they receive these virtues that's what your prophet said all right but then you got 3,000 outside when our so later and they only receive the new birth as faith all right see now then that shows that that new birth could never be eaten away said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against him what a revelation of Jesus Christ so we say each time had the new birth I just got a thing from way did from a brother in some certain place but he said people was teaching you know that that nobody got the new birth in this life stage until 63 you know and all of that it's a whole bunch of stuff but you'd be surprised what's going on right now so if as you I just try to listen to the truth and try to receive the truth for the hour that we're living what about okay I won't get into that because let them go now listen talking about then that there has to be a restoration of the things that was eaten away and what was what was eaten away it couldn't be the holy ghost you can't do that but the word brother Brown said to pure unadulterated word went into the ground but on the back the third and the fourth age right in there it went into the ground because it was eating away all right now see then that word being eaten away it was promised to be restored okay see that way then the hour is here that we believe that we're in the end of time if not wish you're in bad shape anyway you know if you don't believe it because most of us are hitting our our prime time of life you know and we're gonna get out of here one way or the other so I want it to be the right way don't you I got a quote where brother Brennan said we don't need to look out there you remember that what's the point he always made he said where we mess up is looking back to what has been looking forward to what is coming failing to get what's taking place now what's coming is no good to you and I a change of the body a rapture etc that's no good to you and I you because it's not my plan offenses it's not here at that point all right so we don't look back we don't look forward looking at what's taking place now today is the day of salvation all right now see then keeping that as we're trying to bring in the last message of you can have Reformers and that's why in Luther we'll read in a minute you know Luther was called a reformer Wesley was called a reformer even brother Branham will bring it over into the gifts and restoration and still talking about reformed wine because a reformer comes to reform the former age he doesn't have enough word to get to church totally out so he gets it out as much as he can so Luther taught the just shall live by faith now the just shall live by faith was a restoration of God's Word all right but the age and the time and the happening of mankind was reformers time all right so then Luther knew they they tried to pick on that church back there trying to straighten it up Luke this whole goal I've read his own writing about his whole goal was not to leave the Catholic Church it was to try to straighten up the church and that's why brother Adam will call it a reformer and he's trying to reform that Catholic people away from their thing and it struck that the just shall live by faith now there was the word for the age but the people of that age could not go on any further then run around and we read it to you were that Luther's age was called an unfulfilled age all right it never reached a maturity before it could go on it went back down we'll get to that in a minute until we have some might be surprises if we can get to the end of the message this morning all right but see Wesley then he comes along he jumps onto that church beaten against their doing and trying to reform the church the message of sanctification is the restoration of the Word of God amen but it didn't bring forth enough to bring back the original like it was on the day of Pentecost then the restoration of the gifts came in Azusa Street came with the baptism with the Holy Ghost and I read it to you our Wednesday where brother Branham is in the resume of the ages where he said it what looked like was to come forth and be the great promised coming he said it didn't said it proved it they denominated a died and took it now the bride of that age didn't die it didn't the age itself is what's dying in the things but the bride of that age was the bride of that age she was the new birth all right so Azusa Street came forth with the gifts not just speaking in tongues not just that we say penticoff speaking in tongues that's all we talk about they had the restoration of the name right what was his name Seymour and some of those came forth with the name Jesus being restored right all right she didn't come forward with a lot of things to that a but it still didn't come back and bring it to the way it was supposed to bring it why because it was reformer it wasn't time receive in this life day messenger was not to be a reformer because he's a prophet all right see all right being a prophet he's in that word and he's not a reformer he's bringing the word that will start the restoration Luther started it with a judgment little by faith Wesley brought more of sanctification that was part of the word being restored but it didn't finish I keep want you to see that because that way then you can see where you're standing see that's what a lot of people say you know or when I get the new work I get everything well no that's contrary to the Bible contrary to the prophet but people don't care they're just the same own that is evidence of the Holy Ghost you ain't gonna change that person that believes that's their evidence it's gonna take God to have to move on the scene in that person's life to convert them from that because if not they're still gonna go right on but I've spoke in tongues you say what you want to but I spoke in - told you about a lady telling me she was dire when her children received the baptism of the holy ghost speaking in tongues and she named one of them and the girl was in some horrible situations I said no sister I'm just gonna be playing we don't you tell me she got the baptism of the Holy Ghost because she wouldn't be acting like she is right now I said she met spoke in tongues but that don't have it but still that didn't matter see she did more nothing more to do with me because I didn't agree with her saying that's the way people are we'll get to that as we go along all right but in this age according to the first seal now I gave these to you started it off so they don't have to pull this up but you just remember it's in the first seal where the Prophet says the Reformers came to return the Fallen Church age all right and those reformers come and the church age when it was and it went back into the world the words Luther him come out started to do it but to prove it it was not the great move of us of the book of Acts it went right back into the think you're gonna see it a little bit you know bread around them covers a lot of things a lot of ways you when you we get down to the end of it maybe you'll think about it the message called cankerworm palm warm locals caterpillar you need to listen to that message because right around them in the restoration the bride tree covers it but on this message he's more specific you know what he says you ever heard him say it this way he said what the Methodist left the Baptists ate what the Baptist's left the Pentecostals ate and he said it come down to a stump just identically the way he describes it in the ages of the restoration of the broad tree so remember that same bug as I saying the other day when you when Wade was bringing that out and that that quite righteous Church right I said oh bug is after Eid but remembering all of that was a group of people that was trying honest hearted people trying to serve God I think about that just like it was in world war two there when the when the Jews was being persecuted so much you know there was a lot of those German people I mean you know the the people back there lost their lives because they protected those Jews they stood up for him see because it was good people all right so think about now what does it say when you come to getting to the age he said I want you to see what I mean listen the first thing you know here comes the church age is such a mess along comes John Wesley another reformer see the buildings and the see buildings another church age their bills get what I mean another church age is built as long as you have a church age coming into being you're dealing with Reformation I don't care how much you think you're doing you're doing with Reformation that's why there is not an eighth day there's not an eighth Church age there's an eighth day going into eternity physically yes okay well and over but not an eight Church age you can't do that you got to end it with a seven because in the seventh church age according to what he's saying here from the first seal and I'm reading from 189 up to 194 but in the last days it'll have to be a prophet to take up the mysteries of God bring it back because the mystery was only known by the prophets so it has to be this fella come see what I mean now he can't be a reformer he's got to be a prophet because it's got to be somebody that's gifted and set bare that catches the word now do you see what I've tried to explain alright Paul comes forth you remember that Peter teaches the Statue a perfect man and how to become to that place Paul comes in doesn't even confer with him other than just a little bit in his and then he leaves and he's gone for one time he mentions 14 one time two three and a half but or three the earth or something all right and he comes back teaching the same thing that Peter was teaching but he was teaching adoption and that's exactly what Peter was teaching was adoption alright because he Paul was a prophet that God could take to the backside of the desert and not out to get it and he said I didn't get this from no man well you know what brother branham didn't get that message from no man you remember some of them said about the serpent seeds and he must have got it from someone who grew up in the mountains back there or something he said no no he didn't get it from there see brother branham with this church age messenger remember he's got to do two things he's a special built person for doing it alright but as he does then he's comes forth and see he could go to the to the backside of the desert as we call it God could carry him up the statue of a perfect man and he gets up there intelligent in the statue of a perfect man what God has done with him the least little nod and all the things you know why because he was a prophet but he was having to do first the work of the seventh church aids messenger to restore the faith of the fathers to preach there and see being a prophet he could get that you understand what well I try to make it you said well you know we've heard enough about brother Brian being a prophet now you hadn't heard enough about him being a prophet not when you ask people will say well how do we get this well I don't know well brother branham tells us how he brought the word starting back during his early ministry to restore it back to the faith of the fathers proving it by what he was preaching as he went along as I stand there the other day he gets into spoken word his original seed Durango and ask you where anybody read that or listen to the time the brother branham said on there I've got him out on the limb Lord he went right through the message how did that messenger was to come and how I ever thing was to happen and the faith of the fathers was to be restored and brought back to the church and then he turns and he says Lord I got him out on a limb now one we're gonna do God says pick up your pen and write he picked up his pen and read read that that he wrote he starts writing it and when he comes down to the bottom of it he's standing at the same place that he just preached without any hope because the best he could do would have been faith of the father I've told you over and over you don't like it I'm sure but if ever a person in the world had the faith of the fathers it'd be a wonderful world but they'd still be no change of these bodies because there was no change back there all right we got to get the restoration back to the faith of the fathers before you could even talk about a change of the body other than that we're going to go by the grave right we're going to go by the grave because we don't know the thing to take us to a change the message he's already brought if you just listen we're not looking for something else to come the message has done bitten bro God has already done the work proved it but he stood there on the spoken word and reading those seed and he said my lord what do I do he told him he said you speak depending right when he got down to that life part there was something added to his thought what was it but as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled now I didn't write the book ok see then being that of Malachi 4 he could see where what he had brought but he could see there was something wrong because it was not taking him to the change you know you don't I know you're not a minister you're not supposed to do all of the different things with me you ever heard brother around I'm talking about it's like candy taken from a baby have you ever experienced that have you ever really felt that a way about God I preached in 79 the seals in a series and when I finished I stopped because I had a gap between me and eternity the gap was in the word I couldn't go across I laid it aside 82 and 83 I went back come up to that same place and when I did it just went right straight on right on into the opening of the world I tell you that not to say something about me but to tell you it's dire God works it that away if you just listen in your life you'll see what's happening to you you'll see how God is speaking to you and turn you over humps and hurdles in your life if you just listen to it well I'm not if I'm not listen to the simplicity of God speaking to your heart okay let's see the Luther node I'm quoting brother Branham that the bread wasn't the body of Christ so he preached now this is off the first single paragraph 194 he knew that the bread wasn't the body of Christ and so he preached the judge shall live by faith he saw he preached it he knew there was something was wrong so he preached the just shall live by faith now he was talking about the body and what does the justice shall live by faith have to do with the thought that he was having that this body is I mean this bread is not the blood it's not the body and God speaks to him and he preaches the just shall live by faith 1 because it went into a revelation he preached justification look and when John Wesley come along he saw there was sanctification so he preached sanctification which one was it when a minute of the older brothers back there he talked about faith or something he said preach faith and do you get faith preached faith until you get faith so John Wesley come to America to convert the heathen right he met the Moravians River how you pronounce it on his way over here and they actually had the message already going of sanctification they may not have known how to call it a lot of things but as they did they introduced John Wesley to it John Wesley goes back home he says I will head to America to convert to he had come found out I was a healer into it didn't mean that he wasn't saved under the message of Luke come on he didn't find out he was lost he found out there was a gap that needed to be filled in his life or something choisi does he he starts searching to God and he found that sanctification and he preached sanctification I tell you what he must have been a pretty good man I've got his book at the house and some kind of rotten about if you'd like to read it where his wife would hire a chariot to follow him around the country to see where he was really preaching or what he was doing and she would drag him around the floor by the hair of his head and he wouldn't say a thing I think he sanctified don't you I believe now my ride that John Wesley came in and his house was on fire I believe that's correct I'm recording that is from memory from well and back see his house was burned down he said thank God that's one of the other things I don't have to fool with we'd all be crying snubbing in whoo blabbering and everything else wouldn't he just simply said that's one of the things I got fooled you see jurors will great men great warriors of faith come on in to Azusa Street with it and get with them bringing the gifts and the things back into the church and see what they were doing how they would lay in pray all night how they would beg God brother Branham said it I didn't I can find you a quote where he said he said talking about Azusa Street and right in that period of time now not exactly knowing what a part but he said something like that he said they were closer to the coming of the Lord than we are why because they didn't have no doctors to go to they didn't have no medicine to depend on and praise God for all of it but they didn't have none of that they had to depend on God and cry out to him no great people but still as this the street wasn't the end of it why because they begin to denominated and die though the runner said Don the seal book he said they cabbage down on it they begin to die and go into the ground then somewhere about in the 30s there you see the Prophet striking the earth and he starts out preaching a life he starts out preaching a justification of Luther a sanctification of Wesley and the baptism of the Holy Ghost of course he didn't know to call it Pentecostal he wasn't involved in that for a long time right it was only in his life so many years later he found the Pentecostal people and he began to go on and with them but they were great wonderful to him who some of us were talking about this the other day they were really great to him they really wanted him oh yeah all out through the Arizona's they wanted him to come and preach to him but when he stepped down at the tabernacle and he moved out west he said it I didn't he said I come among you and he said but now nobody will have me you know what that's freighter as Freight he's gonna start a church and he told them I am NOT going to start a church but the Peregrine started to church it brother branham's request now that's the words he said what you see they honored that to start with just like the Lord Jesus they wanted him among them until he began to say I and my father one well they got afraid of brother Branham and then when he started preaching those the seals and the deeper things and going on in it oh yeah they just turned away from them but haven't helped them that's their business this messenger is not to start a Reformation I'm quoting from brother Branham but he's to have all the mysteries that those reformers left off and gather them together and solve them to the people now where do we get to the end of the message work that was not his message letter Brandon was in a two-part form he was to be the church age messenger but he was Gope to go beyond that and bring the message all right his message didn't begin in the seals all that was restoration back to the faith of the fathers I've tried to say that for 50 years but who's listening do you see how important that is how in the world could you and I ever achieve into the statue of a perfect man or the faith of the fathers without hearing the prophets message I wasn't the one that made the statement 327 church age book What did he say this messenger of Malachi 4 word revelation 2:10 7 will do two things 1 turn the hearts for the children back to the faith of the father to reveal the seven thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals and it'll be these where they finally reveal mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back so if we want our hearts to be turned back to the faith of the father why have the people turned down the seals and the message of brother Branham his message didn't begin in 43 I remember when you want to come up with a date or a thirtysomething or do we got 40 something that starts to last 47 it didn't start back there that was restoration back to the faith of the father back to work the Bible had been preached but because it was written by mankind we've got to come back to that place before we can talk about anything else 50 years I've been screaming they're trying to get somebody to see we've got to have the faith of the fathers no we don't need to know this we don't need to know that we just need to be good and go to church yeah it's kind of like I told a brother one time he said well these tape people he said there they're sitting at home and listening to tapes what do you think I said I'll tell you what a thing I can you show me one tape Church that ever amounted to anything now we've got some that come out of those tough situation but if you don't realize that truth is something wrong your blindness I said show me I said because we've got a house something present tense and I've never been but one thing and I'm playing people of this message see the biggest portion of them looking for brother Branham to come back and to bring this and that in the other I've never said a thing about I preached it from the day one to where I'm standing today that I believe he will come back all right because I believe you'll be first in the resurrection all right but if we don't get down into what he's already taught what good is for him to come back that's all I've ever said what you're trying to interpret this into turpan what I'm just saying that there's a place brother moment used to preach a message called and I'll find a quote for you but there's a place to be waiting I believe it's in the rapture message brother run said there's a place of the bride will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture I'm pretty sure it's a rapture immensely I remember him preaching that message a place to be waiting I've always gone to phrase then what don't go down to the bus depot to get you a ticket for the aircraft don't do that it won't work you got to go down to the airport so then you get to the word that's all I've ever get to the word and let the word change us could has got to be into that it's got to be to that word being restored why did the Prophet have to come why would it not be okay for him to be a reformer what would it not be okay for him to be a Lutheran Wesley or Baptist or Methodist or Presbyterians or Catholics or anything or all of these new messages and all these great things that's typically why would that not be it you don't take that away with the restoration of the word comes what come on I thought there was a quote that verse Ermine's power or strength I thought you're supposed to listen to that you're a perfect man with the restoration in the word the Prophet said comes the restoration of power that's the only way it can come you show me any other way I'm open show it to me any other thing than the opening of the word no it's okay to be this way it's what I say I got a piece of paper right in there I'll let you read it of what they call the new birth over in some of those countries you saw it's not confused brother Dale okay let's keep on going you've got to have the faith of the fathers that is the restoration back to the word can I quote this one the third seal and in the hour the time of the life's angel the seventh angel seventh messenger begins to sound the mystery of God is finished see restoration back to the word the Bible said again back to the faith of the fathers there it is read it back to the faith of the fathers do you think they'll receive it no sir last days he would restore the original word again as he said in Melancon for but said she's forfeited it she who the church system she's forfeited it oh they got building programs they got all kind of fun but where do they want this message come on he said like Eve in the Eden she rejected hers at Calvary and I see it and I see his group is rejecting here in their last day now he just brought you from back there others of the Old Testament Saints New Testament Bronto and now he's up to the day we're living showing that people are rejecting it we don't we don't need definitely death I remember Richard when you come told me one day he said I didn't know that the Prophet said we had to have their virtues someone that's what he's saying he said we had to have them why wouldn't we not want them well Georgia I cried and long to God from the time brother mo preached the stature of a perfect man I could see it was a necessity I cried to God for years Lord how can we get that Heath ain't beat somebody over the head and you get patience how can we get that then the quote that I just quoted this message melikhaya for do two things all right so there's two parts to his message are you agreeing or you listening part one is to return the faith of the father's that had to be done before the seals could be broke the hell now not to everybody else now I ain't saying it was dire I ain't that way I ain't no boy bless God in 63 when the Prophet was dark he said the Lord was dying I say the Lord's here I said then I said quit playing garbage can just cause a prophet says it here brother dick could get up and he'd say have you ever seen know what is it when a the Eiffel Tower or something maybe he never saw that one but anything Statue of Liberty indeed say it's right here it's right over that blessed God there's the Statue of Liberty I've seen it how'd you see it well he told me about it well is that all you think the Prophet could do you can tell you but God's got a reveal we ain't going out I'm but we don't get to former in latter Ryan but listen Church what was to be restored read what I gave you the ones who read it all through the first seal and then picks up into the third seal and talks about the restoration of the word restoration back to what then he said it on the statue of a perfect man you remember we gave these for 18 for 19 those disciples those people back there they know that was a nod from God they had these virtues in here they had these qualifications and the first little nod of God compared with every bit of this and with his word why did not those disciples take up every little doctor in an idea that come along because they knew it didn't comply with the word right so they rejected it why did God reject all of those books when the Bible begin the King James began to be put together because he didn't compile with the rest of the world and God annihilated it who rejected it from him wouldn't let him put those things in there because we had to have a word right well may I quote it word brother Branham did we had to have the word back in pure unadulterated if you'll go to stat to a spoken word and read no see he said to appear on the don't already in word it struck the world that's what he said go to read the book listen to the tape spoken words original see the pure unadulterated word has struck the world or through his ministry right they wouldn't in everybody and to his ministry he gets over to the Seventh Seal he said heard right in our six percent he said it's gone from you there's no way for you to know it he said what right around to come into the Lord read your message let's see well no I was I was dive lifeguard I heard he preached to see you I know what he talking about I didn't write the book but listen he said these those disciples those people they had these virtues they knew were this they know where they stood they know who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit doing only in the word just one nod from God just one not from God I come dem guys coming along they wanted to buy gifts and they want to do this that minute right and Linda book of Acts and God wanted to buy gifts you know one to do this area and they said we can't sell you the hills God has to give gift we can't sell you gifts come on church but listen all right we'll pick up read just a little bit but quarter number five mr. racin of the bride tree I asked you to read restoration abroad tree and thank you brother Colley brought me a copy of the restoration the right tree so I got one now for some reason one got gone enough I'm valued my books you know thank God I wrote on there presented by James Colley on this date you know I remember that you know because I wanted that book but look what he said yes I asked you to read restoration in the bride tree you're listening to the message I didn't ask him II don't eat I asked you to do it bless going I got my won't bless God go ahead look what he says Roman caterpillar started eating on the bride tree and took it all the way to the roots now it's in this message and it's in the warm part were talking Pilate caterpillar he said you could not eat the life away so remember when he went to the roots the life was in the roots you can't eat that away you can't eat it all the way just cause the church rejected Luther's message of the Jesse 11th my faith didn't do away with justification come on cut it all the way back everything cut the tree right off like he did Jesus Christ Jesus the bridegroom cut the bride right down and started out in creeds and denominations same old bugs but what an Old Glory but in its roots was the predestinated seed the royal seed of Abraham it could not die the word was in the roots of the promise the title of the message today is restoration promised in the Word of God you realize when he said it in jaw somebody has got to do it it's got to be fulfilled cuz he said it why can't we believe we're one I mean why can't we the word was in the roots of the promise I will restore Seth another one all the years of the cat caterpillar cut off all the locusts they can all the rest of the boughs I will restore it back again saith the Lord a promise of a restoration what is that restoration okay go ahead to number five number six now so he's taking the restoration to the bride pre-treat he says there's four death messengers now would you rather with his clothes on okay listen folks there was four death messengers killed that tree now listen to it or did it kill it out in the Dark Ages and started from the book of Acts that book was already dire in the book of Acts Paul talked of grievious wolves coming among you Paul said if any man preach anything then what I preach what a Galatians 1/8 he said let him be accursed now that's pretty strong in it he didn't play around he said let him be accursed if he said anything contrary to what I say and he double stated it said let me say it again that he'd be accursed those men were great men and stood on what they believed and they wrote the Word of God but as time went on what happened plumb worm locust can't go worm pummel worm is that right aiming for messengers of Roman Devils dogmas killed that tree one took his fruit one took his bark when took his leaves one took his mark one took the life is that right amen four messengers of dogmas killed of the tree all but two roots I emphasize that all but the roots and four messengers of death killed a tree for messengers of life restores the tree do you get it he said amen amen for God said I will restore he's going to restore it how by for death messengers killed it then for live messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecostal pin third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost come on what was the fourth the word what the word there were four great prophets what wasn't now come on are you are you lost in what we're trying to bring the ages was Reformation but the men were bringing the message of the age would be restoring the word back right but the age itself was Reformation and proving that it had to be Reformation they went right back and started another church age but this messenger and this life day didn't start no church age they tried to get him to but he said no way oh they done and they were done one of those latter rain brethren and all of that we look at it one of them Martin Luther he began to sound like there was a little light just a very small strength and justification Along Came Wesley stronger sanctification after West becomes stronger than him Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophet now that's not brother Branham that's the Holy Ghost that came one day of Pentecost because the Holy Ghost itself is the Prophet you say how do you know a lot read the rest they don't come to stronger in him Pentecost the baptism with the Holy Ghost in another great prophet but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with a very word the word of the Lord come to the Prophet in the evening lights it is to come forth to restore and bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God forth like big man said on my approach as I said thank but three stages of life I said you got a point what you're talking about he said fourth is Antichrist you got a point four is the number of Antichrist he got a point now what you talking about yeah I knew what he's talking about I want him say it and he said now brother Branham was that prophet to come to lady ousia number three see I said in other words what you believe is your number four he didn't back up and I didn't back up either he said it's four stages to life I said you're wrong there's three stages to life for is restoration yeah but I got I see you go get you books because I'm heading after mine ain't hateful but I'm truthful I want to be plain I want him to know where I stood so I went got the book and read where brother Brendan said life comes in the third stage fourth is this restoration which is the word being restored this causes Antichrist number you know number six is man's number well that's man's number for everybody in the world well you know in the world there's a bride she's on number six you know is she all messed up causing her number I know it but your what's he saying for bugs laid it down for life we'll return it in coming up to a number three and stopping listen to it for killers took it for messengers destroyed for message of death took it away in dogless for messengers of righteousness restored her back again prophesy Son of Man now where's he going in Ezekiel can these bones live wish we had time I got it wrote down how many steps are they in the Book of Ezekiel ain't got time to fool with reading it but watch Leslie watch the fourth stage of Ezekiel's dry bones coming forth what's the fourth stage you got this got that you got seen using all without seeing you you can stand right there they could stand right there in Ezekiel and a full body standing there covered with skin but no life the Prophet had to breathe on them dry bones oh what a wonderful thing the prophet of this last day has breathed go back to blasphemous names and listen go back to where Jesus breathed on them in the Bible there and said receive ye the Holy Ghost they didn't get it right then but you know what they did they got it help around come on church look Ezekiel dry bones coming for but to life only come not when the sinew skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when that's when come back that forth the message all right now what's his brain then explain it justification brought back to pull sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of holiness what brought back the leaf Pentecostals what did it clap your hands and know you know rejoicing pinnacle what the fourth was the word itself the Word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection signed that Christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification had been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organization died out and Christ says again thus entered himself like that cup of the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming of the couch the number force restoration of the word what is it the holy ghost months being honed out so that it can fit Oh the Holy Ghost Bunch we read that the Holy Ghost in brother Branham praise God but he said than in a bunch being honed out so it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified sanctified in the baptism when the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the Tree of Life is growing it in are you with me can you follow it because we say for is an antichrist when you see children for come out to be an antichrist but remember there was four riders to oppose not just three riders to oppose the four stages there were four riders in the seals to oppose right and that life's riders are prophet right you see why that we've got to depend on what he brought he was the messenger to bring us the word well we've got to get it in the right order and not say well it's here because of this or here but are we waiting on this over here amen there's a lot of I'm waiting on in the Bible to be fulfilled amen but let me proclaim what's been fulfilled let me stand it proclaim what's been fulfilled then you can look for something cuz only when it's fulfilled in your life are you capable of looking to what's coming outside of that you're quoting something you're saying what somebody else saying you're not saying what the Bible says are you with me Holy Ghost must be include okay I quoted it to eat 327 Church age book what this mention you're Monica for gonna go to Thun one turn arts or the children back to the faith the father let me give you just a quick one they don't have to pull this butt off the Macy's Abraham's covenant confirmed he's talking about allies come and he would turn the hearts of the children to the father's our fathers to the children see cuz John turned their hearts of the father's to the children now listen to what he says those are I think it is where I won't miss reading it that's part of them aids you know you got hearing aids Rolaids and panda aids and that's part of living ok turn our hearts for the our hearts of the father's to the children see the old patriarch fathers and listen to it this is John the Baptist the old old Orthodox the legalist the law and Riemann he turned it back to the faith of the fathers here to the children the hearts to the children this new message that John was preaching of the coming Messiah in a hand he turned the hearts to this no watch but watch the next the next time John appears until my John the Baptist then he turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so we'd be back to the original message and we you'll you'll know when it gets here it'll be a restoration to send that lukewarm the lady you'll see in church back to that original faith back yonder again see and he will be anointed to do so when this Elijah comes he'll be a prophet he'll pull no punches you'll cut nothing away even the end time of angel' ISM the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture what can it do according to my left eye for it bring is bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the father's the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore all right back to the faith of the fathers listen to what he said here on be not afraid 1963 it points exactly to the broad tree this hour the same spirit to return back again and the fruit no got it and the fruit of the Spirit to be manifested to restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers again it's just exactly the same thing all the way I wish you would look that up a lot on what did I tell you that I believe it's 66 times brother Brown says faith for the father I mean that's very word faith of the Father 66 times all the way through his whole message he's preaching the same thing it's exactly the same thing all the way through the Bible predicted to be here and here we are immediately after the baptism falls and listen and things like that there is supposed to be a restoration of the last days did you read it immediately after the baptism folks what was that Azusa Street right there supposed to be a restoration at the last days and people don't put it off look way out here in the future it usually goes right over the top of your head and you miss it be ready if it's Scripture took ahold of it if it's not Scripture leave it alone see but so help me if scripture see that's what he did in the other days if he's the same today he'll do the same bringing us the message he bringing us to that place don't turn it down but listen brother Branham was to do two things right turn arsons children back to faith of father then restored that ARCA bring the seven thunders which is revelation containing the seven seals 327 or changeable it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the sky so that's a two-part thing that's why you when you're studying blood around this message if you listen to him you'll see him preaching and he'll be here in a minute he's up here the minute he's back down here he's bringing things and trying to line it up he came to first restores back to the faith of the Father and the faith of the father's is the statue of a perfect man the faith of the father's is adoption the faith of the father's is the one God - water baptism the no eternal hell - all of the thing he was to bring all of that he brought it and stood there with it as I said on spoken words original seed and said Lord I've done all of this I ask you please please just go home and get that message if you don't think enough of your soul to go get that message and listen to it or read it then your soul is not the most important thing about you I know what he said well tell me what he said he brings you up to the faith of the fathers and then he says something's wrong yep mouth call for him full feel so what he set out to do the runs message did not begin in 47 that was a restoration back to us in the Bible you find him in 62 he starts to laying it down in the 62 he gets into the pride the things he preaches faith what is it the key I ask you to get right in that area they're just winding up or 62 and get those tapes and then go into 63 and see what happened especially serves what time is it he knows it's there but he knows he's got to go somewhere so he has to go west to get what when you go west to get did he go west to get to faith of the Father did he go west to get the Word of God that was already in the Bible he said when he whipped that top off one of the statement says as far as man knew and had preached these things he went west to get his message okay we're gonna end it by reading this well let them pull it up while they bring it up number 13 I'll read part of number 12 bring back in the last days these great things that he promised it'll bring that it'll it'll bring the revelation what's he to do Malachi 4 was to bring back the faith of the fathers to the children that's right to bring that same thing the same pillar of fire and on the scene and same signs and same wonders the same Jesus making him the same preaching him the same vindicating him to be the same now didn't that didn't that what he preached did not he stand right there with the word improving the faith of the fathers was our guard backed it up is that true they look at him so when he gets to works his faith expressed he talks about him turn back in the great Elohim that'll bring to pice today because we have faith I know this is of God is because this and the other scriptures points to this hour revelation 10 said in the hour of the seven angels message when he begins to sound forth his message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service right now come on are you with me are you with him and the healing services were to bring back the faith of the fathers and restore and God proved it now look at the next one look at number 14 I haven't heard but now I see these are 65 now that we're promised to church age to reformers and we've had them but he promised in Malachi 4 he to keep his pattern in the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Apostolic father for that very purpose and the church is so broke up in denominations and isms it's so torn to pieces till it's dead and watch him it's been a care of year we could preach the whole message right there only the denominations was carriers that's what your prophet said go to masterpiece seed not our with a shuck read them to messages you'll see what he's talking about what the carriers are indeed he promised in the hour of the seventh angels message the seven seals would be revealed in the mysteries of God would be declared revelation 10 when the seventh angel begin to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service where do the next one number fifteen trying to do God a service without being the will of God then you read all the message but brain don't know do we get to the water the mysteries were revealed and will be revealed in the life days when the seventh angels seventh angels message when he not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not the years in preparation well when he begins to sound the message these mysteries then will be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of that now remember brother Branham never preached marriage and divorce in 62 he didn't preach it in 47 but around he tried to preach the seals because you got a message even title at the seal but in you and Ryan he went back preached 63 he said marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals he said even serpent seed was revealed in the season it was preached in 58 it was in the word you remember what they kept asking brother Branham about this marriage and divorce brother Branham could we do this can we do that he said listen he said if you believe mean I'm perforated but he said if you believe me he said go on as you are until I until you hear from me is that close enough go on until you hear from me he said they's been places things made rot in the Bible but he said go on until then now that's on question as an answer to 64 I'll be glad to bring him for you that's before he gets to the seat since the marriage and divorce and I listened a lot dire marriages horse and not a restoration that's a drug direct revelation straight from God proven that his message was right those seals was not restoration that was God's voice speaking through a man bringing unto you and I the revelation of God's Word things that are to be I've asked you to do it sometimes just take the book the title book sit down and go to 63 and just read from 63 own and come and tell me one title to a sermon one titled whoever sermon in there show me one over that was a negative point everyone almost positive things that are to be Christ the mystery of God reveal future home one God God of this evil age or the garden you know all of it was a revelation listen a revelation to those disciples didn't even have brother Branham didn't he come to restore back what they had within his message broke and when his message broke he brought things them disciples didn't have no way of understanding none of them priest marriage and divorce they spoke of it yeah they didn't preach it all right look the omission would be revealed in life stage itself when he begins to sound as Mason see not the years of preparation but when he gets to sound the message these misses gonna be revealed and our and here they are not knowing them and you people are witnesses go to them mrs. rapture now Here Come a tape of the seven churches which in Revelation 10 7 that the great mystery of the book was to be unfolded by the seventh angels message now here is a messenger above always and a messenger on earth he said it there's a messenger above always and a messenger on earth he went out to earn Arizona and met that messenger come on people say he's taking up and into angels and I'd like to know what he said what it was he said he's taking up near my angels if you want to find it I'll be glad to read it to you he said that they told him to go back to Jeffersonville it will be told you later you said no he knowed it's not then he lied because when he come to the first seal he said I don't know what it is I don't know what the second one is he said the Angels come daily to bring him the word it was not written in the form of riding it out had to be in the Bible don't misunderstand it look at the great mystery of the book which will be unfolded by the seven things which meant now here was a messenger above always in the messenger on earth the english word angel means a messenger in the seventh angels message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry then when he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started out when he was bringing his ministry but around his message begun in opening of the word do you understand what I'm getting at I'm playing out way to make it then veterans message nobody could bring it but him because it was his message and he had to be the prophet of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 to be able to do that couldn't be brought by anybody else now some of you sitting here note I could call the names but I won't when brother Branham come out and said now on marriage and divorce he made a statement and when he made a statement was something similar to some of you may have the wrong mate or something to that degree do you know that there was I named the brother he went out and preached because he come through here I've told years later to preached it you may not have the right wife you need to get rid of that wife and get you another one it's old lady he thought that was the marriage and divorce that was his thoughts of marriage and divorce that's just like people today what is the Seventh Seal the great revelation of polygamy you hadn't heard about that the great revelation of polygamy is what brother Branham come to bring us heaven help but listen jerko musician I'm simply trying to explain one day there was a faith of the fathers had to be restored to the church and if that's not restored to the church then we need to not even worry about the rest so we could go home play PT patter do what we want to we can sit down do what we want to or we can seriously get into the message and start studying it as brother branham said and many of you children they didn't know all about Superman's and all of this but said they even know the name of Jesus I said it I'm sorry just say it again and many of he has ever read to see a book through but yet you know all about it they mean he's read Daniel 70 weeks but you know all about it I mean he's rich statue of a perfect man but you know all about it I mean he's read adoption sometimes here um but you know all about it how can you do it without the Prophet saying God revealed it to me baloney is that plain enough that would be adding to the word converter Branham never added one word his message was not an addition to the word it was the fulfillment now listen it was the fulfillment of the entire word that's why timeless restoration promised he realized that when it says to to Eve I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the one promised you realize that had to take place and to do it it caused Jesus his life oh yeah they wanted bread around him yeah they wanted him until he began to say I'm my father's one now watch him and he says in these other things did when he begin to preach those seals they knew nothing about what he's talking about you know why cause they were the horse or the rider I'd rather make the rider to the devil cause that's one of the horses to church how is it gonna come forth you realize where he won't he won't Cologne you realize he's gonna be only a small group I've really just a minute ago in eighth in the days of Noah right and that don't even top the church top of the church with Enoch they didn't even mention his wife I don't know where he had one and odd you know my being with his talks of Enoch one man John went to Patmos says one man to represent the bride of Jesus Christ one man what if it hadn't have been for the messenger of Malachi for me that's why I was asked a question where we talk about the night in the Bible study that's why that's so wonderful to me when it says there in Malachi it don't start right off he's in in the Old Testament he's bringing it to a close and he says remember ye the law of Moses what's he telling man Dini talks of restoration with John turning it and in a Lodge of his day to turn it back why does he say that remember you the word because all the way through the word the restoration was promised all the way through the word the seals was promised all the way through the word the marriage and divorce was promised all the way through the word the revelation to these things was promised remember you the law of Moses why don't you think sometimes instead of being so smart you called me a smart aleck or something but what is this simple thought you could over the revelation 2:10 when they say but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God to be revealed why did he write that why did gone right there John was told to write what he saw and he went across then he saw the age and saw the rapture it's not the fifth chapter saw this things but then when he comes over to the tenth chapter he said look we got this angel this lame to hear this angels are the only thought who said how am I gonna get this back to the seven churches that was his key he stopped he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound that mixture will be revealed John what is not to be may call now but in the days turned all the way back out of eternity right back down to the seven churches and said to Life Church a messenger will be a prophet well what do we got this time I pray you will listen and think on these things Oh [Music] and renew arrived what about it within if I say that contrary to the message [Music] one of people not want this message they throw the house somebody with something you didn't have this until they come here then you got the answer and Oh would that probably went out there we got the new bird you know yourself can you would tell when I first come in it's messy the Ronettes it was over in 1963 that was one of the first stops in this truck before we did was over in 63 when the Prophet came God came down I told her I said according to my Bible bring em over before the foundation of the world you tell admitted Afghan they say cuz I didn't hear the profit is what they talk [Music] no wonder the probably said to cabbage down on it and we knew the right spirit I didn't get to finish it you see what Luther left the bad to say because even though that had been brought back to Luther and Westland thing and yet it's the same thing that Oh bug will eat it Oh bug was eating away and even what Luther robbed above would eat it away they were to dine friend they went forth all the way through that bug is feeling today it didn't stop he still eat today he's eating the melon two away from the people [Music] salvation every God set our Risto [Music] but it made it feel a little flock its what the word says [Music] and renew a right spirit within created me [Music] father we thank you for the day ahead we asked as it now goes down into history because we've said what we're saying and we'll have to meet it someday but we've tried to say what you say it we've tried to speak of what your prophet had to say and we give honor and glory to the man that brought the message we thank you for it but now somebody's got to take that message and walk on somebody's got to become what he taught [Music] somebody's got to become Lord former and latter rain former rain is a teaching rain latter rain is quickening of what taught the prophet priest his message at former rain are you listening the Prophet taught his message at former rain where's the latter rain we've got a lot to look forward to just bless everybody on the way now to eat Lord be with us and happy way in Jesus now you dismiss me not [Music] take not thy Holy Spirit from me run to [Music]
