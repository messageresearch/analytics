========================================

eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you to see shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy holy i want to see amen and amen and amen i don't believe there's ever been a person that really desired to see god that didn't see him because that's what he wants to do is reveal himself to us amen good to be in the house of the lord good to see a lot of you back from different travelings and doing things and right the lord blessed you and took care of you and blessed us here so we we all got a blessing and we pray that the lord would bless remember like wade and brother brother bob dylan's going down this weekend to a minister's meeting and fellowshipping there with them and weighing them weights going down so him in june so remember that just pray the lord would give him a safe journey and everything then remember now the fellowship meeting will be the third saturday at brother tom crushane's so remember we'll have to be leaving here about 10 o'clock all right so if you want to go with us if you want to ride over and back with us let us know and then we can take care of it i believe that's all the announcements any other announcements i generally forget something you know okay no more okay so we'll go to romans 8 28 and then we'll go to romans 10. heavenly father we thank you for this day and for the hour that we're living thank you for being you and we just ask you now that you'd have your way with us tonight and you speak to our hearts lord that we may be able to talk about you in a way that would be pleasing in your sight to be able to bring to the people the words that we have been given in this last days and we thank you for that because lord where would any of us be without this end time message and we just ask you now to have your way bless each one remember the sick among us it was a promise in your word and it's still there that you would send your word and heal us and so lord as the word goes forth we pray that you would just quicken to the hearts of each individual and and make us well in your love we love you and we thank you thank you for the testimonies and the things lord tonight we love you we thank you in jesus name amen and amen the lord willing i said the lord willing i'm going to try to get on predestination this coming weekend you know down into where we've been driving out so just remember that and remember also it's always easy while you're in a series to you know to be able to travel but when you're coming down to the end of it it's kind of well you don't know where you're going next know so not as it's not a lot to preach you just don't know what he wants you to preach so you have to kind of take it easy and kind of walks off all right romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us amen all right romans 10 beginning reading about verse 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call upon him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall he preach except how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of things good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for isaiah said the lord who hath believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen you may be seated if you look at the text and the thought how can you hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sent and talks about faith cometh by hearing all right so now we're trying to get some things laid in order the main things i said i was going to do for a few services was try to get your mind into the thought process of of looking at the word of god as being something that we we should have been looking at from the very beginning but we know we realize we're human beings and uh i asked the question many times of this point does god have a seed or did he create mankind now we know his seed is his word i mean that's that's the law always we call it you know that's set in order but is god tangible like we are or did he create us we'd say well we know for sure that he created us but also to remember that him creating us would make him greater more tangible more real than we are all right because you wouldn't want that that would make the thing that's that's created greater than the thing or the one that created it and we know that's not true but then dealing with the fact of looking at god's word as his seed and how he creates all right now i'll get back to it in a minute and i made a point the other day a little bit about it the prophets would say thus saith the lord because that was god speaking through them right see if i said thus saith james cawley that means james carley told me to tell that so when when a prophet would say thus saith the lord well that would be right but just remember that jesus never said thus saith the lord because he was not using someone else to speak he was god himself all right so he didn't have to say thus saith the lord because he was that word all right now we get back to the end of the message tonight the lord willing we'll be dealing with that but we've been talking about what is the seed of god and we've trying to make a point out of it to where we can think about it the alive word the word made alive is the seed of god the letter of the page is just letters on a page you know if it's not quick and made alive then it's just words okay and the prophet said it could be questioned as long as it's laying in the bible but once it comes off the pages of that bible into your heart it can never be questioned why because it's been made alive all right in talking about faith or revelation and that it comes by as we just got to reading faith cometh by hearing and hearing by let me state it this way and not add to faith cometh by hearing and hearing by hearing the word by faith can i say it that way and that don't change it see it it means faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word that's revealed right see because there'd be no need of saying it like that all right now if that's true then and we believe it then we know that god's word it can judge us it can condemn us we don't want to talk about that as being the word but it will but it can also set us free what's the difference in it it's whether or not we can receive it as coming from god all right now in doing that then see god chose his original plan was not to have to use man you know to speak he would just use man to bring forth what he wanted to because as i said now moses the prophet made it plain that it was first god's thought then it was moses thought and he said it's not a word yet all right but now that's not said about him when he was writing genesis exodus leviticus numbers in deuteronomy and moses never said thus saith the lord in that writing see if it had not been a fall we know that it was wrote about the fall we know that okay but had it not been a fall had there not been a problem we wouldn't have been in this condition right even after the fall god wanted to speak to every individual amen all right you agree with that because he did see okay but now when it comes as we were covered the other day when it comes there in exodus 20 and god came down and gave the commandments by moses and because of his presence being so um great of the thunders the lightnings the things you know the people got afraid and they said uh now moses you speak with us because if we you're god we're going to die they got us scared right all right now what about mankind then choosing choosing mankind to bring the word now did you hear what i said i didn't say god i said mankind choosing the way he wanted it to come but then he turns around now and what does he say we don't want moses to speak no more we don't want brother random to speak no more we don't want you know this that or the other we want to hear from god ourself that's really a change isn't it but you know god will never do it that way because once we wanted the prophets to speak to us then he won't change from that right okay now watch that when we come through the old testament then we come to the new testament and he used paul which was a prophet right all right he's still speaking today amen because he spoke to us in the end time through the prophet right all right see then faith cometh by hearing now hearing comes by the word now think about what i'm saying and i'll get back to it after a while and emphasize more first it was god's thought and then it was spoken and it becomes a word well then we're trying to make it to word that we think that we can receive for ourselves instead of having to depend upon somebody but why does the scripture say faith cometh by hearing well now brother dale i never had never went to church i i never but you heard somebody you heard somebody you read the bible that was somebody speaking to you now what i want you to show me is anybody in the bible that ever received the holy ghost without hearing the word first like to have that you know i'd like to know that i know god can begin to work on people yeah but why would he begin to work on people you know or how would he begin to work he could speak to man right don't you believe he spoke to this prophet in the end well see then there's nothing wrong with the way that it's going it's just the point of trying to make that we wanted a way of it being done but then when god came that away then we turn it down all right amos 3 and 7 says what he won't do nothing except reveal his secrets to his prophets all right now we ended up coming over into the new testament there sunday and bringing it to the new testament prophet which would be the apostle paul because he wrote the biggest force in the new testament and paul reaffirms the fact or covers the fact of what we've done in our representation with the people back there when they said don't let god speak let man speak and paul brings it down to the scripture we just read and he says how shall they hear without a preacher you know there's a lot of tape churches today because they won't hear no preacher and they say we believe everything the prophet said and he said my full ministry was for the perfecting the saints paul said that see a scriptural lineup was made by the apostle paul in saying that how can we hear without a preacher all right but he didn't stop there he goes on in our thought of saying what and how shall he preach or they preach unless it be sent all right now then we must realize that what he's saying that some are going to go out with their own words right and it won't be sent you know i'm not arguing with nobody about who's sinner who's what i'm just talking about the word why would it be that he would say how can you hear without a preacher i said now you hold on just a minute satan's got his angels that's other scriptures right even as ministers of righteousness and honor but he puts a stipulation on that minister that says how can that minister preach unless he be sent so he's stating as i was trying to get to sunday one fact mama called daddy since no a preacher right i've listened to preachers talk about their call to the ministry and i'm not going to argue with nobody i'm just trying to state facts of what i believe paul said the mystery wherever he was called i believe every god called minister you notice the way i said it now truly called minister that is sin of god has something to bring to the people no matter what age you're in no matter what you have something to bring to the people and that's his purpose you know i've told you many times maybe mine is just to be so outlandishly hateful and arrogant and stubborn and whatever to be that i just seem to have or have been led to deal with contradictions seemingly that are in the message and the people of the message maybe that's me maybe that's just me it's okay dumb dokey tells you the truth you got to amend the donkey right no matter what you mean baylor turn around that donkey quit talking to me but i'm trying to save your life you know and he realized it but now think about it so we ended up speaking where the prophet said on the message things that are to be 1965 that these ministers would sweep this on they would take the message sweep it on to the coming of the lord all right now then we went over to where he was talking about it on believing god in 52 he said really what a minister has is just an ability to break the spell that satan has over your mind and he says that demon there is to cut you off he said the reason i wasn't saved quoting him what he said when i was 12 years old he said because there was a demon there now he was sincere don't you think so well now he was born a prophet okay praise the lord but in this dispensation since calvary to be a prophet in the body of christ is necessary first that you get into that body amen so then the prophet had to be born again and he tells us about his new birth all right and in doing that he doesn't say well i was a prophet all alone i don't have to get born again i come to seed in me that's the way the people say it now right but yet your prophet emphasized that he needed the new birth and he emphasized the scriptures that paul did that you can't hear unless you have the holy spirit to reveal the word to you that doesn't mean you cannot memorize it listen to it 24 hours a day it means it's not revealed until the holy spirit comes amen and reveals it all right and according to what christ mr god revealed about 45 i think it is he said the holy ghost is the only revealer of the word then think about it it's necessary that we hear the word amen i made the point there emphasizing that you know if you come into the world with this seed like everybody wants to make it and i believe what the prophet said on those quotes we will get back to all of that we've been through parts of it but but it's just emphasized by people that you don't need a new birth all you got to do is just believe well that's all right that's everybody's business all i'm trying to do is get you and i to see the one question i asked 30 something years ago i said is the new birth the birth of the word that you came here with it in you that you believe or is it the birth of the word that you hear after you get here that's all i want to know and that's all i want to know tonight because if it's what you came in the world with you don't need nobody go home stay at home don't even put no tapes on the brother adam because you don't need him you just need to believe you always wise yeah you just get brother there you just get you get us all stirred up because of your your stubbornness maybe you'll study a little bit and maybe the lord might speak to you all right but now listen the one point i'm trying to get across to you and was sunday and i want to relate just a little bit to it and move on is what is the seed of god we say well it's the word well then you can hold the word in your hand read it memorize it right it won't do you no good unless it's quickened right so it's any natural seed you hold it in your hand you keep it they preserved it six thousand years in the pyramids of egypt and they opened it up went got the seed put it in the ground nourishment of the ground the moisture produced grain wheat you know why because it was a germanized seed it was a seed that had life in it right now watching you'll understand what i'm trying to get at how can you hear without a preacher he said well what are you doing brother dale i'm just going sowing seed or are you sowing seed and i know the word of god is called a seed i know that but are you really sowing seed how are you doing it are you doing it with the letter only come on i thought that the only way he could preach was the fact that he was sent and if he sent then how was jesus sent you remember that how was jesus sent god came down went in him i thought a true minister of the gospel was to try to help you break down the word the prophet had brought not to try to get another message or be anything greater than the prophet no we recognize where we get it from and just remember the bible says oh you have you received all right see then wouldn't the minister then be trying to tell you what he sees when you find that out one of these days you'll realize that a lot of preachers all are doing is sowing their own seed they're sowing their own seed i'm trying my best to get you an eye to a change of these bodies in a rapture and a resurrection if we die and go by the grave that's my goal that's my doing that's all i've been concerned with all right we could have a big home church if we could have everything we could be you know but we sit in a building like this but we are debt-free and we can help other people and do things all right but you see if you're sin of god you've got something to say as i said about the man learned the bible you know the battle was over and this runner took off and you know he knew what to tell could have been told another man come on let me go let me go let me go he said don't send him no no i want to go he said well go well he outran the other guy right that's right but when he got to her now no message well what's the message i don't know and while here comes a man little slower he gets hurt and uh he tells the message well the prophet preached the sermon right running without a message all right so that means we can do everything and it look right right go to church preach all kinds of things happen and it'd still not be sin of god yeah i face that because what if i'm one of those that's running without a message all you got to do is a choice to find out whether i'm running without it or not i got to be responsible if i am or not all right but now think about it a natural seed we look at it we say we have a seed of corn but we can't find the life of that corn they can make one look just like it everything perfect except for one thing what no jeremy of life so is it then if i'm bringing what god says if a true preacher is bringing what god says tells him first right how his woman must what be first partakers of the fruit i get a message i come here i try my best to deliver that message to you because that's what a true minister does and i don't have my message i'm just the vessel that's being used all right now in that then where is the seed of a grain of corn so we got to see the corn really we don't even call it that right we say we have a grain of corn which is technically more rot what is the true meaning i just quoted these the other day what is the true meaning of the word seed i don't have to look it up i know what it is well according to the strong's concordance 22 33 the word seed means offspring descended it means children what webster says what we're supposed to speak by right says the seed is the germ or propagate for creative or population if every how you say co-creative which means to reproduce source of anything the ability to reproduce it means sperm or even semen is the word seed all right now we've been over and over that it takes the germ and the egg to make a seed all right so now word and spirit is the seed of god word by itself is not alive the letter killeth and you can have the spirit on your spirit can still be lost so one without the other is no good now i can holler it's coming back see it takes the word and the spirit so now do you see why the preacher's doing if i preach my own ideas i'm showing a denominational seed that's what your prophet calls it and that can't be made alive only the word of god could be made alive right and the word of god then being germatized right germatized we're in a day of that aren't we where that we deal with germatic seed that's what we're talking about tonight and if that seed hasn't been germitized it won't reproduce that's right even a hybrid that can bring up just to deform things it still has to be to a degree dramatized and that's what we do with the word of god when we take our ideas and we put it on the word of god we deform that word and no matter how far we can go with it it won't produce correctly right think about how that prophet when he came and started preaching how he realized what he was doing how he was preaching the word of god it was totally contrary to every denomination it was truly he stood alone didn't he you know a handful of people believed him and just like jesus a lot of that handful you know some of them after brought a random past on within six months was back in denominationalism that were names he called on almost every tape but you see they got the letter of the word but they never caught on to what the man was doing he said well he was planting seed was he planting seed or were you trying to put a germ into the people we don't deal with germs seed gene in the correct way do we we did well it's all a seed brother tail we'll go get you some corn that somebody made and plant it right some way get that germ out of that grain of corn and go put it in the ground i mean the the grain of corn but also the germ won't do to put it in the ground it has to rot rotting out rottening out is what produces enough what do you call it energies or whatever you call it um to make the grain come alive well so is it with the word of god what if faith comes by hearing then somebody's got to preach it all right because that little yeller thing you're looking at that's not the grain of life you go there pull him up out of the ground one day and you look and it's all just cracked open and rotten and like everything and and your corn done up to three inches tall huh even your crows know that you watch them go after it all right the ability to reproduce is what a seed is all right then if the germ of life is not in the seed it won't reproduce the whole shell husk whatever you want to call it the outside of the grain is not what reproduces it's the life in the grain all right the prophet said lean not to your own understanding if it didn't have the germ of life in it it could never be quickened right now do you understand what then the seed really is you talk about a peach seed and we say it's in the heart of the pizza what are we calling we're talking about the ability to reproduce i remember at work down there one time a man boy he got on to me and he challenged me and i said okay i accept because he said let them tassels you see out there on that pecan tree this spring he said you plant them tassels and that brings up the pecan tree i said man you're crazy i know what i've read okay what you doing you gotta get the seed i tell you what i'll do i'll flap me some tassels or what you call you plant you some okay i took him a peace tree i mean a pecan tree he never brought me one because that tassel don't do it all right that's beautiful isn't it come on i mean see where it's hard to go with the thought when you say look at all these churches and how beautiful they are but they're only tassels now i have no germ of life and you say well no i'm not talking off of them i'm telling like it is they'll bring forth more denominations what do you want to call them brandon mice or a little odds that's no problem with me but we call the hull the seed when really the germ of life is the seed because then the letter killeth but the germ of life see the spirit give us life but the spirit don't have something to fall on it can't reproduce itself the outside of the hull will not reproduce but the germ of life will now watch and you'll see why paul said that we cannot hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sent all right a scent preacher is one with a message you agree no no we're not talking about brother brown's message right he brought his message we're talking about the part that we're supposed to break it down to help understand what the prophet has said all right see then i must first get let's see if you can follow me and walk with me i get a thought by listening to the prophet's message all right and i wait for that to be quickened because i realize that if i depress too much i can run overboard and it won't work so i wait i've had things that i studied for 20 years before i ever preach them most preachers won't say that right why because it would not progress on in the rest of the word so even though it was a good idea or a good thought a thought is fine but remember the devil can give you thoughts too yeah but i know the difference brother dale the devil's mean and hateful and and god sweet and humble i've had him to tell me a few times to sit down and shut up it didn't sound too nice but it had a meaning to it and i done what he said see then if faith comes by hearing then someone must speak the word before it can be made alive now keep going back to this over and over where you won't run me off i'm not talking about trying to get um the thoughts of moses even though that is in it as you come down i'm talking about getting a thought from the message of the hour getting a thought from what the prophet has said and then looking to see whether that's right or not see jesus sowed the seed in the disciples now is that true amen about three and a half years right you know they understood some of the things he said right finally one of them said one day on where's peter one of them said you know we now know that you you got the words of life and one day jesus said why don't you go he's where can we go they saw certain things and like i was bringing out the other day we talk about we just make a seat alive we just throw it out anything a little woman at the whale she was looking for the messiah she had heard right and when he came that was quickened to her that that was who that was did that give her the new birth that's all i'm asking then if the ability to make her eternal was brought by her understanding that he was the messiah then what does she need calvary for what does she need the day of pentecost that's what people think they quote they'll say we come here with a seat and say look at that little woman at the whale okay look at her i don't believe she went on being a prostitute dude i don't believe that but that did not give her the new birth and as i said what about mary that would be a real good case but your prophet said mary pulled up in the upper room received the baptism in the holy ghost all right he said but peter he had a revelation of who jesus was right the heart the christ the son of the living god and just like mary who denied him being virgin born and being on god we find peter lying and cursing about it i don't know this guy is that what heaven's going to be you see no matter how much you hear the word preached which is vital got to be no matter how much it's shown it's got to be quickened if not it's dead if it's sown and does not rotten out the life cannot come forth and we was reading there the other day and one of the parables were that they took the seed and and it sprang up okay but the cures of life and the things took it away you'd never do any good did it see then the word must come through somebody and when that word comes through somebody i hope you're going to follow me down for the rest of this message it's going to come first to you as a thought and if you don't believe that thought if you allow satan to take that thought out then look what you got see it's got to be a thought before it can be a word right so then all i'm doing tonight is using letters of a wording to speak to you but god can take that and drop down into your heart and quicken to you not even what i'm saying at the point he might speak to you of something that i'm not even talking about and you say oh i say that well all i done was what the prophet said i broke the spell satan has over your eyes where god could speak to you because that's all i'm trying to do you know what i'm trying to do tonight i i said it sunday and you know i thought man gonna give all the calling he'll be nobody coming up here and a lot of people did but i made the point in the emphasis on one thing preaching the gospel is casting out devils if you want to be healed make sure you ain't got a devil that's brother dale you who that's what your prophet said casting out devils is casting out unbelief well i didn't realize i had it well that's the point if you realize you had it you already done got rid of it but you see i know that's what i'm doing and i know then that when i speak that the biggest portion of the people are taking only the letter of the word i'm saying they're not listening for a revelation they're only listening to words that i say to try to trap me into well you said so-and-so but you see it first must be a thought now that thought you receive if it's quickened it makes a lot of that thought right now you go with me if that thought you receive is quickened you know i have no problem well then what did you get you got a journey that's right the thought is adjourned brother brown said we wouldn't a german god's mind a germ a thought that's all i can do says to gail he's trying to speak to you in some way try to break the spell satan has over your eyes you can't see it and that's not nothing wrong with all that away but yet speak something that you can take and hold on to that and that's what them disciples had all they had was one thing where can we go is that what they said where can we go now that's the words of eternal life you're the only one with the ability to bring life to me was what they were saying right all right see then first it's a thought and then it becomes a word when you speak it amen now are we back in the scriptures are we over in romans where it says with a heart man believeth but said with the mouth he's speaking right right is that romans see them speaking the word and it's necessary to speak according to what he says if not we've got our own but now as i said i'd like to say it over and over show me any word in the bible or any word brother branham said that people receive the holy ghost without first hearing the word well yes god i'd worn this seed in me i didn't need nothing well go ahead you know argument you i'm just saying i didn't see it that way that all right why because i'm a firm believer in you must be born again and if you're not born again you're lost and die and on your way to hell that's as plain as i can make it that's where everybody wants that thing though yeah but if i'm predestinated i'll be there of course i'm going to live like the devil while i got to change he said oh that's not said it's not why did why did we go on doing what we was doing if god wants to save me bless god he can save me he can't without you first accepting it i just i just old enough i guess sorry you just still believe in justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost and believing that you must hear from somebody whether it be a tape you put on whether it be the bible you pick up and read you are hearing what someone has said all right adjourn a seed would it be possible that we could have all the word in letter form come on and it not be quickened i believe it my computer has it don't yours you know it ain't saved and a lot of people can have photographic memories of the bible and things that don't save you right so how did the prophet explain something to us and i believe it's very vital and it'll explain why how can you hear without a preacher how can he preach without it unless he be sent all right go ahead brothers pull up number one on the notes this is from spoken words original seed reached 1962. we start 389 through 92 then jump over to four 300 and something all right but look now watch remember god's law of reproduction now remember after it's kind that's right corn against today amen the seed of christ the word must come through his body now he really got hilarious evidently you know evidently enjoyed what he said because he said what the seed of christ the word must come through his body then are you getting it carnegie said yes just a minute now let's get quiet and pray and you know let's go on he said i want this to grind down the seed of christ must m-u-s-t must come through his body not through a denomination but through a born-again seed of the word must come through now remember what it is christ's seed how much how does my seed come through the body how does apple tree seed come through the body seed is through the body and christ is the body of christ or excuse me the church is christ is the body of christ that's right congregation said amen the bible church this birth produces that's the new birth himself in body his church is his word so that people can see the confirmation of hebrews 13 8. it must come through the body the body of christ is the bride of jesus christ right is that according to paul all right wrote it up excuse me not to jump up 399. you read in between and see if all this don't stay together but let's go to a paragraph 399 still from spoken word oh here we're going to get in something deep now now watch this seed church this real church with a real true sperm now i remember some ministers one time saying that the eunuch couldn't preach because he's sterile sounds good don't it but i thought the ethiopian eunuch went down to egypt or where it was he went down there and all of them a lot of them got converted but he didn't have no seed you see folks what i put up with in my thoughts and then you you think i'm hateful i run into these things and you you know what do you want to do you want to roll up a piece of paper and say here's what brother brown said it and you won't cram it down the throat sorry i'm human you don't like me that's fine pray for me but i'm human right it gets you stirred up this real church with a real true sperm because i can call a man's name that they told him he couldn't even preach right here in this pulpit that this brother couldn't preach because he wouldn't marry it i said well paul wasn't married boy he went haywire paul was married he's on the sanhedrin had to be married to be honest i said i don't give a hoot what the sanhedrin said i said besides even brother branham was saying it's i found it showed it to him but that's even if it if paul said you'd have to be like me so if paul's wife was dead we'd have to kill her wife that's silly in it but it ought to strike home see the eunuch had been with the dds watch him now remember god never committed god never committed his his preaching and his gospel to an angel now you're not talking about a church age messenger not right now come on he's talking about a heavenly angel how many knows that now what's the scripture he gave how many knows that galatians 1 8 said if an angel come from heaven and preach something else besides they had preached let it be accursed so the angel is wrong if he's different from the word god came on down below angels and committed it to man which were sons you believe that but they say amen now watch now he never committed to angels notice he did not do it now philip has been up to pentecost now remember back of a mother we're talking about the word sowing and we're talking about the germ coming through the body that's what we started reading did you forget that he said the germ come through the body he said how does my germ come my seat go through the body we'll go through it watch now philip had been up at pentecost jerusalem to worship and he says amen to that the eunuch he had been with all the dds and lds and everything why didn't he get something he'd come back down see the eunuch had been up to jerusalem to worship right you know that right everybody understand he was up there at jerusalem worshiping he comes down he's sitting reading the scripture and he says this man speaking of himself or another philip took the scriptures right and what the unique he had been with the dds and ld's and everything but why didn't he get something he come back down studying the prophecy of isaiah although an angel directed philip to him once but the germ of life had to come through the body all right philip oh brother now we're on the line where did the germ come from through the angel no the angel showed him where to go an angel is a messenger here is a son philip had the germ the message the word that's how a child can be born laid his hands upon him philip baptize him in the name of jesus christ there come forth the spirit of god sure enough the germ had to come through the from the body what body christ's body correct and philip was a member of the body okay an angel directed him to peter to kinesis but where did the word come from the body oh oh oh oh i feel pretty good i feel like traveling on an angel come down and said don't worry don't call nothing unclean just go on don't think nothing and why peter spake these words not the angel not the cardinal or peter spake these words what he was the body he had the word the word took hold oh brother we oh my angel directed it but the life coming through the body and the eunuch had been up there and heard all of these but it didn't bring life peter went to the house of kines directed by an angel right an angel came to mary right but the angel said you'll be overshadowed you couldn't bring the seed come on paul on the way to damascus vision directed him right came down struck down et cetera but ananias had the germ and the word my the prophet and then i saw a vision they said go up there and lay your hands on him he said brother saul the lord appeared to you in the road coming down here how did he know he had the word the word of the lord came to the prophet prophesied went up there and said he come he sent me up here i might lay my hands upon you and you might be healed and receive the holy ghost receive your sight the scales fell off his eyes he rose was baptized in the name of jesus went out to study angel directed it that's right but paul had to see german it takes the spirit of god to seed to give life eternal and that ought to be enough right there to make us realize that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word and how can they preach unless they be sent because if not they'll preach their own ideas and god can't quicken something that's not right did he say it in a church age book and non-seed does nothing to quicken what is non-seed scriptural terminology is what is non-seed seed without a germ of life right brother brother said the baptist has got the word come on you're going to argue with him he said they got the word but why didn't he bring the life close their own seed no germ of life no germ in the seed and we'll bring it to life all right now how does a prophet receive the word we'll speak for a little bit on this if i have to i'll cut off take it up sunday as the prophet use his own thoughts that's what i've tried my best to get you to see even about the spoken word that we'll get back to eventually why in the world didn't brother branham speak the word to cast that growth out of his wife he was a prophet but he waited on god amen yeah but i thought adoption bless god's gonna be one day when i just come out terrible no for your benefit we should be that way but i don't agree with it because i've always taught you one thing this is 40 years i've had one talk adoption is not the father going off the scene and the son coming on the scene that's what mankind teaches adoption is the sun going out of the picture and the nature of the father coming into that son that it's the very nature of almighty god dwelling in that son and then he can speak the words of god amen if i'm wrong that's 40 years and i've been that away and i still believe it more today than i ever have see we think adoption over it brother dale you don't understand adoption just when he just gives me a right thinking thing i want to but roman said you have within you the ability to speak worlds into existence something to that degree maybe paraphrasing it but what'd he say he says hell by bar that you can't do it well bless god i'll just do what i want to go right ahead help yourself that's up to you but let's just think about now how god transmits his thoughts to mankind and i'll give you one in here in a minute if we have time to read it on a sunday where brother ryan says that god had a thought and said then he spoke it right and it become a word but that's always the word not like you're saying it and brother random emphasizes that when he says in the beginning was the word word was with god the word was god and the word was made he said that was genesis 1. when god said let there be but listen to what he's saying now let's see if we believe this go ahead number three which is taken from the fourth seal paragraph 67 the word itself is spirit it's spirit and word form remember the other day when i gave this one you see when it when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts see because that now look here a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word then when a thought is presented it is a word what's it he's talking about the bible right now this is the god's thought that he has placed in the word what and when we right we everybody talking about you and me you know somebody then when we receive it from him it becomes a word talking about you and me but you see folks like i said while ago and i've still got the same thought the word come to the prophet it don't come to you and i except by way of the prophet now that's as loud as strong as i can make it yeah but brother dale i got thoughts the prophet didn't get bye-bye don't come around here we don't need it thought has to be a fault before it could be a word and then when a thought is presented his word now this is god's thoughts that he has placed in the word and then when we receive it from him it becomes a word now he illustrates it what god revealed to moses what to do moses spoke it and it happened see that's it when it really comes from god going down to the next one paragraph 289 on the sixth seal he was talking about moses and his mouth and isaiah and them you know and god might have been straightened of the jews he said god put the word in moses's mouth see it's god's thoughts going into moses's heart he goes over now to express it then it becomes the word he stretched his hand forward said let there be flies and there come flies look here and if any man hurts them the two witnesses what's going to happen fire's going to proceed out of there they can speak what they want to and there it happens so there's more to come right look at the next one which is laura grace 1954 1006. he's talking about sunday he's talking about when he's talking about when god speaks it has to be so there is no way at all to get away from it god said let there be it has to be now the very word itself and the word was a thought god when he before a word is an expression of a thought god thought in his mind it into existence god thought well i thought it's always the word it just this goes back and you just don't understand brother there's always been the word why did the prophet spend so much time bringing down the logos theophany the the speech the word of god and why is it that the bible says that jesus christ created all things why it says without him there was not anything said that was said it's easy to understand he's that right look at the next one this is uh letting off the pressure 62 609 evening uh eve 68. you bring it all the way down you read all you want to to hedge your sword word coming sharpen it into edgy sword listen to the word amy believes that in the beginning was the word that's first it was a thought and it has to be a thought then when it's expressed it becomes a word and then in the beginning was the word in the word with god and the word was god when he spoke it and the word became flesh and dwelt among us when he spoke it all right you see church that's why i can't understand why people don't want to go with a message so beautiful and to realize that brother branham brought us the thoughts of god i don't understand one right after all the garbage can who is this melchizedek 65 paragraph 6 55 notice now his attribute then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us it goes to john giving in to begin in the beginning was the word when the time begun it was word but before it was word it was an attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word going to the next god hiding in simplicity okay well let's finish that first first being with spirit god's supernatural all right to eternal secondly he begin to form himself towards flesh and at the often is called the word a body this then is the state he was in when he met abraham what's called male charity now did not god just speak a body into existence he can speak what about your prophet going to the next one going to hide it in simplicity 63 412 261. now if the blood of bulls and ghosts could give a power to moses to go out there by the commission of god and stretch forth that rod and say that there come flies he had the word of god and he spoke that word and when he did it become from god's thoughts a word is a thought expressed and so then when god thought it and put it in moses's mind and he spoke it it become a word and moses turned around and went back maybe not a fly in the country you know what happened the creative word of god that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man god uses men god could have used the son to preach the gospel he could have used the wind to preach the gospel but god chose men to preach the gospel what about it look at the next one it's taken from the third seal 63 320. paragraph 97 before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created all right so god's thoughts became creation when it was spoke by word now does that come on all the way down to where brother random and the lord said what do you need you need squirrels any problem he said under the blood of bulls and goats they spoke god's word come on so god's thoughts become creation when it was spoke by word that's when he presents it to you to you as a thought his thoughts and it's revealed to you hold on then it's still a thought until you speak it right all right that's the reason moses went out to pray that pillar of fire hanging around him and he said go hold your stick towards the east and say call for a fly and there's no flies but he went and held the stick there and said let there be flies no flies at all yet went on back but the word god's thought had already been spoken it's a word now it's got to happen go on to the next this is taken from the absolute 62 and a word and now a word is a thought expressed first it must be a thought and it becomes a word because you do not speak your words without thought now i've seen a lot of people that i'd almost argue about that because their mouth is constantly running and i know they ain't thinking forgive me but they still got to think right you can't say anything unless you think it you want to quote where the prophet said you can't say cat unless you think cat i'm just being a little obnoxious all right go to the next one this is taken from the message letting off the pressure of 62. and immediately believe that in the beginning was the word that's first it was a thought it has to be a thought then when it's expressed it becomes a word and then in the beginning was the word and words with god and the word was god when he spoke it and the word becomes flesh and dwelt among us i gave that a while ago it's in there twice all right go on to the next one let's see what it is i gave you the wrong all right this is number 12. this is taken for the word made flesh in the india trip 54. god's thoughts expressed through those mortal lips of isaiah a man with sin and things i have with his ups and downs like i have and like you have but a yielded vessel to god expressed the thought gods thought through word and no matter what they done isaiah's words had to be fulfilled because for it was god's thought expressed through isaiah what about it words expressed through isaiah look at this next one taken from believing god 1957 e45 and now watch i've seen it work and to think if you'll get into the to that contact with god it becomes till it isn't your voice anymore it's not your thought anymore it becomes god's thought in god's voice you're just a vine or just a branch he's a vine and if your spirit that goes in and energizes as long as you can get yourself out of the way he will fill it up and then when you can be a witness just like mo noah's ark was a witness like jesus was a witness of god he become so full of god till him and god was one god dwelled in christ reconciling the world to himself the very expression now what about it of course i know what most people think they think all of these quotes that i've given tonight it even said we and us and you they think that they only pertain to brother branham in his speaking that's what you believe go ahead and believe what you believe but you see i believe still today faith cometh by hearing and hearing comes by the word and i still believe that somebody's got to speak it to us and i believe you sisters could help us if we listen to you because you can get a thought from god and you can speak it to us what kind of spirit would it be to say i'm not going to listen to no woman can you tell me what that spirit is but what about it it becomes god's thought and god's voice i thought we believed that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel meaning that voice was still on magnetic tape systems or whatever we're doing going around the world but i believe there's got to be a bride to receive that word or else why bring it if it's not for someone see we believe well it was for the prophet well amen we don't have no problems but the prophet is one that said the fivefold ministry would take this and break it down to it the bible's one that said that he said it they'd take this and carry it on to the coming of the lord you know but you see are we turning down the vessel now don't you agree let's see when moses went out there god wanted to speak to all the people right he wanted to speak to all of them and they chose moses to speak well now did that change god or was it it just changed the vessel the the ability to bring it forth right because just because man was accepted did that change god no because in prophets they never said nothing until they had thus saith the lord they waited on god to bring the message to him and when they did they spoke it it was written down you know and taken and doing and made a bible and you and i can read that bible and the prophet then he said okay i'll give you a message fourteen hundred sermons the only time that it was capable of recording the messenger's message you know very little writings of luther wesley or whatever you know small amounts of things compared to what you and i have we have a message that we believe was god's message sent to us to a prophet and we believe so much until we believe that the bible is right when it said the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel and a trumpet we believe this message was the descendant of god through a prophet but i guess all we're supposed to do is just sit around and wait nope i've always been blunt plain straight just tell it like i believe it if you're waiting on brother random to come back to preach to us we got to be ready to hear it i've said that from day one i still say it we've got to have the foundation laid how long do you think it would take him to come back now and re-preach to god try to get the people to believe the word took him 30-something years to be able to preach the statue of a perfect man that's what he said and i've never said that there wasn't going to be anything like that because i said he could come back and preach to us but i still believe the bible says they which is the one that's going on without us cannot be made perfect or brought back to the right position i believe it's you and i that's going to call him out of the ground i have no problem with him preaching to us that he does that they never have been misunderstood totally but i'm not just sitting down waiting either at least we ought to be prepared and believe it the only way we can be prepared and believe it is believe what he's saying amen and believe who we are because there's a message there called recognizing your day in this message even though martin luther brought the message of the justice league by faith there was a people took that message and made it alive even though john wesley brought sanctification there was a people who brought that message alive and put missionaries around the world even though the holy ghost fell on azusa street it was still a people and to make that alive but do we believe the things that he said pull up number 14 there and let's just read a couple of messages then we'll quit this is taken from the message escape hither come quickly 58 202 e54 now if your life tallies up to the life of jesus christ now you can see immediately there's going to be conditions upon a lot of time but brother dale it says out in the bible if you say go reading a little bit further and it says if you don't repent and forgive people god won't forgive you you mean this message is just for any joe blow he says i believe the prophet live like the devil i'm not in that day i'm sorry now if your life tallies up to the life of jesus christ that is he said in his word there if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that it's coming to pass and you can have what you say what you say the only way you could move that mountain would have to be deity speaking when you're a son of god you receive god which is zoe god's own life then you become a part of god then if your objective is right and your motive is right it's not for everybody this message is not for everybody it's for a selected group of people that can believe it look at the next one taken from the tested time 58 530 e14 if you say to this mountain be moved not if i say if you say to this mountain be moved and we know that man could not move a mountain just by speaking to it the only thing could do that would be deity so then if the mountain is before us and our objective is right and our motive is right then it isn't us speaking anymore it's deity speaking then it has to move i truly believe that the church is on the brink of one of the greatest outpourings that has ever that it's ever had in this age i believe it i can't say the lord told me but it's just something inside me just catching a hold of something that i haven't seen all my life until just now and how glorious it is to know just before the coming of the lord that these things are happening what about it do we believe it the prophet's still talking look at this one wait with the next one number 16 philadelphian i'm excited with perkman church h 60 1207. paragraph 91 now he is the living word and this wrote on the bible is part of him then if you can receive this and remember the whole message behind you get the thought it's your thought it's got to be he said revealed remember the quote he said then you speak it oh i got a good thought you remember the man that told brother branham said i won't straighten out a little bit on your marriage to divorce issue you remember that he said i had a vision brother branham and he said i immediately seen he had a dream but he said all that was well and good which is not according to scripture so no matter what our thoughts are amen it's got to be according to the word you remember one time there in the bible where they said well we've got to talk that land is ours let's go get it that's right they eating our wheat the prophet said don't go that's right well i got it thus saith the lord brother branham said they said but that won't work it's got to be in his word see part of him then you can receive this into him which is the word this word comes into you by faith makes it alive because oh catch that the word comes into you if the holy spirit's in there it's alive as soon as it comes in all right and every promise is true nothing therefore you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart because what you are deity speaking you believe it the bible said so and whatever you say shall come to piss if you'll not doubt if you can get all of the the world bred out of you let the holy spirit make you a full son and daughter of god no world no condemnation no doubt what is it then it's no more you it's god in you and you take his word you remember the whole thing that i've emphasized it's not you it's god doing it it's a promise to say father it's your promise satan something has got to move all right look at the next one this is taken from the presence of god 64 6 18. if you'll notice i go before and after sealed on a lot of the quotes because i want you to see it was back there and it's down here god don't dwell in big buildings he dwells in your heart god don't dwell in intellectual education he's far from it he dwells in humility in your heart he dwells in his word and his word comes into your heart and speaks itself out speaks itself out and it declares he interprets his own word through you he is trying to find somebody to get a hold of to show that he's still god and he is he will do that if he can just get somebody he can speak to once if he can get another woman with a blood issue he can still speak the same thing he can still do the same thing making known declaring we're in the presence of god not recognized go ahead we've got a couple more next one is programming church age page 170 church age book now then this word he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said his word was life john 6 63 be that is exactly what he is i am the way the truth and the life if any man have not the spirit of christ is none of his romans 8 9 there it is his spirit in his life and exactly what the word is and it's exactly what jesus is he is the word so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and place it upon his lips well that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man must be talking about somebody well brother dale we've always believed that the word comes to the prophet i hope i've said that enough through the message to believe that the word come through the prophet see then i get the thought you notice a lot of people just take scriptures and they'll just run with it and others i'll just take quotes and run with it why don't you intermingle them together because this prophet can't speak anything contrary to what the bible's written amen come on but listen we said well brother dale the word only comes to the prophet the message has come to the prophet we're not looking for another man to come to bring us a message we're not looking for a brother dale to raise up with a certain and he takes over into no not looking for anybody else to do it looking for a bride to do it but look at the lights when they want to take page 164 to pergamon church age church age book remember now john the baptist was both the prophet and the messenger of his day he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb when he was baptizing in jordan the word of god jesus came to him the word always comes to the truly spirit field okay that is the evidence of being filled with the holy ghost that is what jesus said would be the evidence he said i will pray the father and he'll send you another comforter let me abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive now we know what truth is back on some scripture i think i was using sunday why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word did you notice that jesus said that the world could not receive the holy ghost well in this verse i just read neither could they receive the word why because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the holy spirit as the prophets the word would come to you you would receive it i believe the word comes to the spirit field i believe this message has already come the world can't receive this message because he don't have the holy ghost all right he said well brother dale what are you expecting to happen i expect things to get a whole lot worse than what it is number one not a doomsday preacher but just plain language because we're going to be about to be tried to see whether or not we'll stay with the word you know old age may be a gift to some of us we may not live to see things come on where somebody is amen somebody is going to become the word because the prophet has already said it somebody is going to come to the basis by the prophet's message to believe god's word somebody's going to walk off this earth in that word why can't we contend we're part of it but you see church it's got to be revealed when god is not quotes on a page come on that's right one god is not quotes on a page you know yourself the world is dying fighting over matthew 28 19 and acts 2 38. one said it's father son and holy ghost one saying this lord jesus christ what do we say it is i've told you i've heard people in this message say we take acts 2 38 they take matthew 28 19 i told him and i said if they'd take matthew 28 19 they'd come out and baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ that's the only way you can take it listen getting ready for sunday then a prophet saying we were born with this seed in us let's let him answer what that is because he was the one who had the message well it's just what you say well if i said anything wrong tonight i want somebody to show me where i said it but if i say what he said and i don't have to worry about it but i believe the word's going to be made alive in somebody somebody's going to walk off this earth why can't we believe it's us let's stand a germatized seed has this message become a seed in your heart a germ in your heart has it become real to you and i or is it just quotes on a page or is it really a revelation if it's revelation you're not going to be spending your time trying to correct the messenger all right you're not going to do that go ahead what do we got anybody have a need amen i wish i had a voice to be able to sing that would you sing it unto him and think about him would you know the peace that comes by giving all would you have him save yourself let him have his way we've had a message what we need is the holy spirit to quicken out but you know what he said it and it will come to pies somebody is going to fulfill this word why can't we believe we're part of it yeah but brother dale i got too many problems you want to run that quote back where are you talking about isaiah now having his ups and downs in this problem he said like i have that didn't change god he didn't change god he's going to bring his word you know in brother branham's ministry the gift was taken away for about five years let me remember that about five years the gift was taken away from brother branham would you show me in that five years that he wasn't still preaching the word it's just a gift he was still standing there he was still praying and people were still being healed delivered saved then one day it came back what about it during that period of time to ask him so what he's doing he said i'm going to show and see he never quit he was still on the field traveling and preaching and didn't have that gift that he'd stood there with but you know what he was still a prophet you know what those messages he preached in that period of time is still part of the message because this is a message this is not just gifts and signs and wonders it could be a live word but i believe the bride is going to be the alive word praise the lord the lord praise the lord let all god's people praise the lord right shake off those heavy man and lift up those holy hands oh god praise the lord i will i'll be somewhere listening for my name right the opening of the word calls your name call her name by hearing the word we've heard god's voice listening for my man you're dismissed pray one for another remember the service remember wade bob and him june wade and bob and his family and all them traveling just pray the lord will bless them father in the name of jesus christ we ask you to just dismiss us tonight in your love lord forgive our sins cover us by thy grace we love you and we thank you father and let your grace be sufficient for every need in jesus name listening i'll be something hmm
