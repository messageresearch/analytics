[24:55] I have to go do it we've had a little
[24:57] problem with somebody walking around so
[24:59] we've had to
[25:01] um
[25:01] lock the doors downstairs
[25:04] not the one coming up the stairway now
[25:06] that's not that's the end of the church
[25:08] we're talking about down into the bottom
[25:10] part of the of the church because of
[25:12] somebody walking around and doing things
[25:14] and there's a lot of equipment
[25:16] downstairs that could be very easily
[25:17] carried out while we're up here right on
[25:20] the side door so we'll just have to lock
[25:22] it up down there if you need to go
[25:25] downstairs don't get all excited just
[25:28] find Terrence or somebody and they got a
[25:31] key they can open the door for you okay
[25:33] just don't go haywire and try to run off
[25:36] to McDonald's you know just hang around
[25:40] we'll try to take care of everything but
[25:42] we just do it because of that and then
[25:44] but the main stairways are open they're
[25:46] not that's not locked up it's just the
[25:48] downstairs part okay all right yeah
[25:51] do you have any father we thank you Lord
[25:53] for your love and your grace unto us we
[25:56] thank you
[25:57] for the day and the time that we can
[25:59] have upon the Earth
[26:01] when we can actually
[26:03] really be able to read your word and to
[26:06] comprehend
[26:07] what is being said unto us
[26:10] because our eyes have been opened to the
[26:12] truth
[26:14] and Lord we can see then what is written
[26:16] in thy word things that we pondered and
[26:19] wondered about
[26:21] things that man has gone crazy to try to
[26:24] figure out
[26:26] and all of that has been made known to
[26:28] us in the end time by way of the Prophet
[26:30] who brought the word into us
[26:32] and now we thank you for all of the
[26:34] things we ask you now to just bless each
[26:36] one of us as we read your word you come
[26:38] and speak to our hearts forgive our sins
[26:41] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[26:44] keep us in your love
[26:45] I ask it all in Jesus name amen
[26:52] Revelations
[26:54] one
[26:55] what is this book about
[26:57] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[27:01] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[27:03] things which must shortly come to pass
[27:05] and he soon and signified it by his
[27:07] Angel unto his servant John who by
[27:10] record of the word of God and the
[27:11] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[27:13] things that he saw
[27:15] blessed is he that readeth today that
[27:17] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[27:20] those things which are written therein
[27:21] where the time that is at hand
[27:26] okay Revelation 6 verse 12.
[27:30] and that beheld when he had opened the
[27:31] Sixth Seal
[27:33] now who opened the seal the lamb right
[27:35] right and lo there was a great
[27:38] earthquake and the sun became black a
[27:40] sackcloth of her and the moon became his
[27:43] blood
[27:44] and the stars of Heaven fell into the
[27:46] Earth even as a fig tree passes her
[27:48] untimely fix
[27:49] Ed when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind
[27:52] and the heaven departed is a scroll when
[27:54] when it is as they scroll when it is
[27:57] rolled together in every mountain and
[27:59] Island were moved out of their places
[28:02] the kings of the earth and the great man
[28:04] and the rich men and the chief captains
[28:06] and the Mighty Men And every Bond one
[28:08] and ever Freeman hidden themselves in
[28:11] the dens and in the rocks of the of the
[28:14] mountains and said to the mountains and
[28:15] rocks fall on us and hide us from the
[28:18] face of him that sitteth on the throne
[28:20] from the Wrath of the Lamb for the great
[28:24] day of his wrath is come
[28:26] and who should be able to stand you may
[28:28] be seen the Lord have his Blessing to
[28:31] the reading of the word
[28:33] now
[28:35] we are trying to just study some things
[28:39] and just look through that
[28:42] the message and see and not just
[28:45] basically preaching on the seals and
[28:47] things
[28:48] but to this going through the Book of
[28:50] Revelation
[28:52] as I said this morning
[28:54] he's in the Book of Revelations truly is
[28:56] the bride's book amen right because now
[28:59] we can understand there was a time we
[29:01] couldn't
[29:02] we were told to stay out of it have a
[29:05] Genesis day out of Revelation why
[29:07] because it would show who we are and
[29:10] what's going on like I said this morning
[29:13] I've made this statement for many many
[29:14] years I believe it
[29:16] The Book of Revelations is the bride's
[29:18] book amen because you never see Jesus
[29:22] standing in the Book of Revelations by
[29:24] himself
[29:25] he's always with the bride or in the
[29:27] bride or with Israel you know in dealing
[29:30] in Israel and the things you know to
[29:33] thereby but he's never seen by himself
[29:36] and you find that he is oh
[29:40] coming forth like we brought it down
[29:42] this morning to you know
[29:45] Luke 17 30 that the son of man would be
[29:48] revealed
[29:49] and then we see that we get over in the
[29:51] Book of Revelation about 1 13 of our
[29:53] bouts and it talks about
[29:57] one life under the son of man you see it
[30:00] was so close to the likeness until
[30:03] that's why it emphasizes one life under
[30:05] the son of man
[30:06] and the prophet said that's bride right
[30:09] he looked to see the voice and saw the
[30:12] bride well we can find ourselves
[30:15] then we went through and picked up
[30:18] through the Church of Aviation a few
[30:19] things and we went up into the the uh
[30:22] started in the seals and begin to just
[30:26] read them and then going on through and
[30:28] we've gotten up now we spent quite a
[30:31] lengthy time on the fifth seal
[30:34] because there was a lot of things that
[30:36] there that needed to be a little
[30:39] emphasis placed upon and then now we're
[30:42] coming over into the Sixth Seal
[30:44] and what did we see as we started out
[30:46] this morning that
[30:48] in the fifth sixth and seventh still
[30:51] there is no combat Beast
[30:54] there's only four and that ends on the
[30:57] fourth seal
[30:58] and the Rapture takes place on the uh
[31:01] the in the seventh Church age
[31:04] but in the the revealing of the seals
[31:07] before Co would cover up to Armageddon
[31:10] and being up to Armageddon in the
[31:13] Rapture of the church had already taken
[31:15] place because Armageddon is at the end
[31:19] of the three and a half year tribulation
[31:20] period to setting up the cleansing of
[31:23] the earth and the things getting ready
[31:25] for the millennial Reigns all right in
[31:27] doing that then we drop back the prophet
[31:31] said it to the fifth seal and see who
[31:33] these souls are that were under the
[31:35] Altar and found out that they were the
[31:38] the chosen of Israel that the prophet
[31:42] said was from the time of Calvary down
[31:46] to the Rapture of the church
[31:48] it would be that group of people that
[31:50] was killed down through there and they
[31:52] will be given what roads all right and I
[31:55] told you I said that's the most
[31:57] marvelous understanding of justification
[31:59] our true mercies of God Amen because a
[32:03] group of people that do not want
[32:06] Jesus Christ as their savior they
[32:09] rejected him as being their savior but
[32:12] yet when it comes down to the end of it
[32:14] God kept his word amen because he had
[32:17] spoken and said that people would be
[32:19] saved Paul covered it all Israel will be
[32:21] saved he said now not ever Israel
[32:24] only those the prophet said whose names
[32:27] were written on the lounge for Goliath
[32:30] amen amen and said they remained our
[32:32] remember their son that on and off and
[32:35] different things but
[32:37] and then when we get through that part
[32:40] we see the wonderful story of Grace as a
[32:43] sin that he would give her mercy of
[32:46] Salvation that he would give those
[32:49] people white robes who did not even want
[32:52] it whatsoever
[32:54] and he said that wasn't this Wall Street
[32:56] much of Jews he said it was a real one
[32:59] from down in those countries that had
[33:01] never heard the gospel you know that
[33:04] plow and he said even still with a
[33:06] wooden plow we were there in Israel
[33:08] years ago and actually saw him doing
[33:10] that was still just in one handle plow
[33:12] you're doing things and and those people
[33:15] are good people
[33:17] but yet they rejected the Messiah they
[33:20] were blinded
[33:21] let us be coming in all right then we
[33:24] came on over into the Sixth Seal
[33:27] and seeing that there's no combat Beast
[33:30] all right
[33:32] now we found out this morning that the
[33:35] fourth combat Beast would be the eagle
[33:39] and by being that being John would pick
[33:42] up in the 10th chapter and say but in
[33:45] the voice days of the voice of the
[33:46] seventh angel he could see that there
[33:49] would be a possibility of bringing this
[33:51] great Revelation to the church by way of
[33:56] the seventh Church AIDS messenger our
[33:58] seventh angel all right then that would
[34:01] put us into that position that we could
[34:04] see it right and then you don't have to
[34:05] put right around over here
[34:08] me that's been massively confused by
[34:11] people
[34:12] in the message of saying they don't
[34:14] understand but the prophet said it so we
[34:18] believe it and it sounds it I just want
[34:21] it revealed right all right then
[34:23] uncovering that
[34:25] we saw in this six sealed
[34:27] there's no combat Beast
[34:31] but I told you there was a great secret
[34:33] partner too
[34:34] when we got into the fifth seal
[34:37] and it was a very simple thing
[34:40] in the fifth seal there's no symbols
[34:43] right
[34:45] you just read it right
[34:48] it tells you those people right that's
[34:50] right it tells you what happened it
[34:53] tells you how they got there right it
[34:55] wasn't a symbol of a white horse or a
[34:57] red horse or a symbol of this or a
[34:59] symbol of that
[35:01] why because
[35:04] that would make it to where the Prophet
[35:06] could just expound upon it
[35:09] and we could see it amen then it would
[35:12] open up to our eyes and see the same
[35:15] thing when we come into the Sixth Seal
[35:18] there's no symbols
[35:21] they just said it to him
[35:23] this great earthquake
[35:25] and it tells you the things that
[35:27] transpire
[35:29] during this earthquake
[35:31] one because see we have come through the
[35:34] understanding
[35:37] and now the symbols are broken right
[35:41] the moisture symbols are broken
[35:43] what's the problem of understanding
[35:47] now we can go through the Bible and
[35:49] understand
[35:51] we can see all them symbols that was
[35:52] back there
[35:55] and Ezekiel would say A Wheel in the
[35:58] middle of the wheel all right
[36:00] or he would say uh that they were
[36:02] running like lightning of Blue Book
[36:04] what's that
[36:05] um
[36:07] you know cherish Johnson in the streets
[36:09] right the symbols have been broken by
[36:12] way of the Prophet Messenger to explain
[36:16] the Bible
[36:17] okay we don't have no
[36:20] excuse
[36:21] for not understanding
[36:24] you know
[36:25] well but brother Dale oh you know I
[36:29] don't understand why don't you read
[36:34] I mean you claim brother was a prophet
[36:37] yes
[36:38] yes and yet you know more about
[36:40] uh the presidential race
[36:45] come on man that's right man you sure
[36:49] like to argue
[36:51] what brother dick said one day he said
[36:53] he'd go out there gills from where I
[36:54] live because he see him sitting out
[36:56] there so they ain't going out there
[36:58] not all in the world they do it in argue
[37:00] politics
[37:03] and what good is it out of all her
[37:06] arguments
[37:07] who got elected
[37:09] yeah right whether you like it or not no
[37:11] I'm not a Republican or a Democrat
[37:14] I guess I'm a polar crowd or something
[37:16] because I just I voted a lifetime for
[37:19] John F Kennedy I found out right around
[37:21] and said you put a Catholic in the white
[37:23] house I'm honest and ain't voted no more
[37:27] because and I'm not saying if you not to
[37:30] vote that's your privilege
[37:33] but you know
[37:35] I'm just saying that we're in the end
[37:37] time
[37:38] and surely
[37:41] surely you can see yes
[37:44] my brother called made that statement
[37:46] the other day it was pretty good
[37:48] he said if you're voted for Obama
[37:51] that he's a muslim with a prophet
[37:54] false prophet
[37:58] but if you'd have voted for Romney
[38:04] they got a false prophet
[38:07] so we voted for Jesus Christ amen and
[38:10] God's got a prophet
[38:12] I like that statement it was a good
[38:14] point
[38:16] put all the money set into that
[38:18] you know looking at those things I enjoy
[38:21] look at the things but what does it make
[38:23] a difference right I love the scriptures
[38:26] amen he said I put in Kings
[38:29] I take out Kings you know who God wanted
[38:32] in the White House
[38:34] the God is not her
[38:37] because he put them in he's going to
[38:39] take them out that's right
[38:41] he's the one we need sure we may be
[38:45] hungry
[38:49] but we're going to be taken up because
[38:51] they're not going to shed us up right
[38:52] all right amen amen I believe they could
[38:55] be some horrible days laying ahead of us
[38:57] but I believe in a God that brought
[39:01] around said it he said the bride does
[39:03] better under persecution we ain't got
[39:06] nobody bothering us
[39:09] and the words we got is you sisters
[39:11] getting like that when you walk to
[39:13] Walmart
[39:14] yeah
[39:17] we say there's no problems we need
[39:20] something to jog us a little to make us
[39:23] dig down and see who we really are all
[39:26] right but that's what I'm trying to do
[39:28] all right but there's no symbols
[39:30] in the six seal
[39:33] you just said an earthquake
[39:38] yep I won't get into that part because
[39:41] it takes a message in itself
[39:43] we talk about the earthquakes and then
[39:45] you know people say with this and this
[39:47] this well
[39:49] we're going to read in a minute there's
[39:50] an earthquake when the seal opens
[39:52] there's an earthquake after it's open
[39:54] right
[39:55] yep there's an earthquake at the
[39:57] resurrection when Jesus raised
[40:00] and I believe that'll be one in the end
[40:02] time when the bride races
[40:06] yeah look a lot of earthquakes tonight
[40:08] but yet we narrow down to one or two
[40:10] things and we make our own talks or a
[40:13] Doctrine idea
[40:15] but no symbols
[40:17] right
[40:20] now whether you believe it or not in the
[40:23] Baptist Church
[40:25] actually basically you read more of The
[40:27] Sixth Seal in the commentaries and
[40:30] schofields Etc
[40:32] about the Sixth Seal when you do of any
[40:35] other form
[40:37] because we used to say this was a
[40:39] tribulation
[40:40] of course we'll get to it in a minute
[40:42] we used to believe we all went through
[40:44] the tribulation too you know that was a
[40:46] great mystery
[40:48] right
[40:49] the great straightening up
[40:51] amen
[40:54] because see we talked about it we I've
[40:57] heard preachers preach about the
[40:59] the
[41:00] six seal they didn't call it because
[41:03] they didn't know to bring it they were
[41:05] bringing earthquakes and things that's
[41:07] right but you see
[41:10] the prophet didn't come
[41:12] to tell us
[41:14] what it was
[41:16] now get what I'm saying you'll see the
[41:18] offense oh
[41:21] the power
[41:24] of the reveal word all right
[41:27] the uh the importance
[41:30] of it right it's just like I said this
[41:32] morning
[41:33] the lamb could break the seal
[41:37] please the eagle couldn't tell you what
[41:39] that seal was
[41:41] it was closed up to him
[41:44] right
[41:45] and he says on that first seal written
[41:48] it he said I'd made a horrible mistake
[41:52] now listen Church
[41:55] we were dealing with this the other day
[41:56] in a meeting
[41:57] the brother was bringing out that when
[41:59] brother when the sword came and brought
[42:00] around his hand remember
[42:03] in Sabina Canyon right the sword came in
[42:05] his hand right
[42:08] then he comes all the way back right
[42:12] and it was even the the angel saw you
[42:14] know the clouds and and the voice there
[42:16] says go back to Jeffersonville then we
[42:19] told you what to do
[42:20] it a lot of people thinks all that was
[42:22] opened out the urban according to him
[42:23] that was right now according to him he
[42:27] said
[42:27] on that first Hill he said you know
[42:29] right before he said I don't know what
[42:30] it is
[42:31] right
[42:33] well he said I'd have made a horrible
[42:35] mistake
[42:36] if God had to come and straightened me I
[42:39] don't want to see him to say reach it
[42:41] first see them
[42:42] it's after the sword in his hand after
[42:44] the things
[42:46] he still didn't have the understanding
[42:48] until
[42:49] the angel of the Lord met him and
[42:52] revealed the word
[42:53] because he was a prophet yes
[42:58] but those things were sealed up I was
[43:00] laying that down this morning to say
[43:02] this that
[43:03] it wasn't under the line it wasn't under
[43:06] the Opps it wasn't under the man
[43:08] but you could call that man death
[43:11] it was under the Eagle right
[43:14] all right then there's the eagle now all
[43:17] he has to do on the fifth sixth and
[43:18] seventh seal
[43:21] you notice I said Zelda
[43:24] could I believe he done it
[43:26] all he's got to do is tell us what that
[43:28] is right
[43:29] he doesn't have to deal with symbols
[43:31] anymore
[43:35] that's a wonderful thing
[43:37] he didn't have to deal with symbols
[43:41] he just told us what it was
[43:43] who are these wrote a random he asked
[43:47] the question
[43:48] on the fifth seal he said
[43:51] this is Israel
[43:53] to be saved as a nation
[43:57] what is this six seal
[44:00] that we're talking on
[44:03] he finished the tribulation period
[44:08] those are not symbols
[44:11] those are statements
[44:13] of fact
[44:16] God vindicating
[44:20] a prophet
[44:23] just tell us the symbols
[44:25] how much more when he's just speaking it
[44:29] straight
[44:31] I'm telling you what it is amen this is
[44:34] the Tribulation period
[44:37] no questions
[44:39] he just answered it
[44:41] not a symbol right
[44:44] it's a great statement then in the Sixth
[44:47] Seal open
[44:48] it opened went up earthquake
[44:54] and when it did
[44:56] then you're told what will happen right
[44:58] that's right the little turn of this
[45:00] just don't do that you say well well
[45:03] brother Dale I I don't know where this
[45:05] happened that happened see now you're
[45:07] trying to figure it out that's right
[45:10] we talked about one down there though
[45:14] Moon turned into blood
[45:16] I've heard every kind of a definition
[45:20] said I can tell you where that's already
[45:22] happened
[45:24] well until you find where he said it
[45:26] happened
[45:29] you're just beating your head against
[45:30] the wall
[45:32] good as your own concept
[45:39] do we could talk about it and I believe
[45:41] in it when the towers fall they're in
[45:44] the scripture
[45:46] jerk I was in the word
[45:50] those two planes didn't go into those
[45:53] Powers by accident
[45:55] man I was in God's work I can't believe
[45:57] that
[45:59] then you can find back there that
[46:03] they stood before the Watergate and read
[46:05] the word
[46:07] why don't you remember when that
[46:08] happened yes the Watergate trials and
[46:11] situations right right when the prophet
[46:14] was striking the Earth with the word
[46:17] I believe in all of those things
[46:21] but what I love to Anchor It Down is
[46:23] when the prophet sits this is what it is
[46:28] right
[46:29] go before then you can
[46:31] argue opinions or ideas
[46:36] but when you say the prophet said
[46:39] right that settles it
[46:41] all right so then let's just go on into
[46:45] it let's pick up
[46:47] where we left off this morning and you
[46:49] forgive me for my throat like I said I
[46:53] either put in cough drop or a hush
[46:56] so a lot of people says well don't put
[46:58] in the cough truck
[47:02] ideas for
[47:04] eight or ten years
[47:06] nice Stripes I'm Healed and that's right
[47:08] I ain't worried about it but
[47:12] I had a bad throat
[47:14] I'm so you pray for me about that
[47:17] and forgive me for having to
[47:20] handle it all right
[47:23] don't know what happens
[47:25] go ahead let's start with number 10 on
[47:27] our quotes
[47:30] remember what is this six seal
[47:34] we want you to tell us
[47:36] all right
[47:38] so when he gets in the sick city of
[47:40] paragraph 67.
[47:42] you talk about the time you know we're
[47:44] studying right now
[47:46] this time that we're studying right now
[47:47] is what right after the church is done
[47:50] gone no Revelation 4 1.
[47:54] yep there's a bride going up 19 just him
[47:57] coming back see all right
[48:00] see these things are the tribulation
[48:02] period
[48:04] I love that you know to have it
[48:06] understand it but this is the part I
[48:08] love
[48:10] the rest of it I mean I think it'll be
[48:12] truly settled and every believer's heart
[48:14] that this true church never takes the
[48:16] tribulation period
[48:17] amen you cannot put nowhere the church
[48:21] in the tribulation what you put the
[48:23] church there
[48:25] but nothing right right
[48:29] see see the bride's done gone because
[48:33] she has not one sin
[48:36] another thing against her the grace of
[48:39] God has covered her over under bleached
[48:41] has took every sin away she's right into
[48:44] the presence of God she doesn't have to
[48:46] worry about the tribulation
[48:48] all right but the tribulation period
[48:52] and then we'll drop over
[48:54] and uh
[48:55] pick up a little bit more about
[48:58] because I thank God
[49:00] and we don't have to go through the
[49:01] tribulations
[49:03] the basics of world teaching religion
[49:07] you know
[49:08] is that you're going through the
[49:10] tribulation
[49:12] at least there is a division among it
[49:14] all of them don't teach everything the
[49:16] same
[49:17] there's a division among it that says
[49:20] they're going to be three and a half
[49:21] years minor tribulation in three and a
[49:24] half years major tribulation
[49:27] and the teaching is that the bride
[49:30] Church they call it right
[49:32] right if you're through the three and a
[49:34] half years of minor tribulation
[49:37] but then she goes up and then there's a
[49:39] major tribulation and a great vast
[49:41] number of Gentiles would be saved in the
[49:43] major tribulation
[49:45] well
[49:47] they run around when he came out and
[49:48] told us
[49:49] right a lot of things were settled right
[49:52] there
[49:53] and he said sit down
[49:56] a lot of people don't agree with him
[49:58] he's the next people sitting right here
[49:59] no yeah
[50:01] that don't agree
[50:03] because they believe the bride's going
[50:05] to go through this tribulation
[50:07] and he said no sir
[50:10] you can't do it
[50:12] then some confused even brother Branham
[50:14] when he preaches on the Daniel 70 weeks
[50:17] it takes one week after the Rapture they
[50:19] confuse that with the denominational
[50:21] teaching of the tribulation of minor
[50:23] tribulation major
[50:25] but he had no connection whatsoever to
[50:27] it all right and there is no Gentiles to
[50:29] be saved after the Rapture okay
[50:32] it's not in the scripture any word he
[50:34] said that's right
[50:35] they got to be saved now
[50:37] well who is that group in the
[50:39] tribulation it's only Israel in 144 000.
[50:43] all right
[50:45] we'll get back to that and do it but
[50:47] I just want you to see
[50:50] the main thing is what is this seal it's
[50:52] the tribulation pyramid right
[50:54] the things that man as I said has talked
[50:57] about
[50:59] horrible times would come up on the
[51:01] Earth
[51:03] and it would be a vast problem
[51:07] um to where the birds would even eat off
[51:09] the Flesh of you while you're alive see
[51:13] uh of this if we read where they would
[51:15] cry for the rocks to fall on them and
[51:18] hide them that's not a symbol
[51:20] that's a fact of what will take place
[51:23] one day that's right upon the Earth
[51:25] right all right then
[51:29] in seeing that
[51:32] and seeing that we don't have to go
[51:34] through that amen
[51:38] if that don't clear your heart man
[51:42] I'm going to say it anyway because I if
[51:45] you're not very if you're pretty old we
[51:48] had that denominational Doctrine
[51:51] where do you understood it
[51:53] or heard it talk
[51:56] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[51:58] Pentecostal whatever believe that the
[52:01] church is going through the tribulation
[52:04] so I never heard that talk in my church
[52:06] maybe you wasn't deep enough in the
[52:08] ranks
[52:09] to understand some of they were saying
[52:12] maybe you slept in like you do now
[52:17] maybe you don't agree
[52:20] maybe you just shut your mind off
[52:23] because I realized minds are like
[52:26] computers
[52:27] you know they'll blow a fuse
[52:31] and the thing won't work no more right
[52:35] and my sit down has its own mind
[52:39] and I don't know how to figure it out
[52:42] and I don't have the little boy in uh
[52:45] Blended Day wood they're coming over to
[52:47] straighten out on Dagwood's computer
[52:48] every time I got a big old boy named
[52:51] Richard my son-in-law and they just call
[52:54] him up and say hey this thing's messing
[52:56] up again
[52:57] you have to come over and fix it and uh
[53:01] he's gracious to do that
[53:03] but now listen
[53:06] if it's the tribulation period
[53:10] who would want to go into that
[53:12] right
[53:13] and what we just reading
[53:19] you remember brother random when he was
[53:20] preaching about his first sermon
[53:23] and he preached about hell
[53:26] am
[53:28] he said to one thing one problem we
[53:30] wouldn't know God there
[53:33] there what no Daddy there man
[53:39] the yellow understanding
[53:43] what would be the most horrible
[53:46] thing you could think of
[53:48] burned alive
[53:51] um animals eating off your flesh
[53:54] while you're alive
[54:00] that would be the problem if you had
[54:01] thoughts of
[54:03] God stepping on the scene in just a
[54:05] second to take you to Glory right man it
[54:09] would not be an enjoyable time but you
[54:11] would know you had something left the
[54:14] greatest of all
[54:16] but what about if you don't have no
[54:18] homes that's right
[54:20] you realize churches you and I
[54:24] miss this rapture
[54:28] we we got a problem trying to qualify
[54:30] for foolish virgins even though I
[54:33] believe that there will be more foolish
[54:34] virgins out of this message than
[54:36] anywhere right and I can quote where the
[54:38] brother around said it's those out of
[54:39] the seal book who never heard the
[54:41] message
[54:42] or those who were blinded by false
[54:45] Shepherds right
[54:46] you know the preachers of this message
[54:48] are blinding the people to the truth
[54:50] amen and they're going to wind up in the
[54:52] tribulation period
[54:55] maybe God will be gracious to him and
[54:57] give them eternal life
[54:58] at the white throne
[55:01] but
[55:03] I don't try to reserve anything just in
[55:05] case this don't work out that's right
[55:07] you know that's what the people now are
[55:09] doing and churches are doing they put
[55:11] their money in the Swiss bank account
[55:14] just in case
[55:18] they want a little bit left over or
[55:20] something you know just in case
[55:22] well I've never done that I always just
[55:25] give away everything I had never worry
[55:27] about it and uh
[55:29] I just
[55:31] I don't have no second
[55:34] thing
[55:35] this is it
[55:37] all right I got a problem but I'm not
[55:40] worried about it
[55:41] I just didn't want to be it I want to
[55:44] encourage you and to teach you
[55:47] to be able to miss the tribulation amen
[55:49] right well the only way you can miss a
[55:51] tribulation is be born again right
[55:54] if you're not born again you're going
[55:55] into the tribulation I am too if I'm not
[55:57] born again right
[55:59] right
[56:02] you know that's the prophet said the
[56:04] most important thing in your life is
[56:06] whether you're born again or not right
[56:07] it's not who's going to be president
[56:10] amen
[56:12] it's not whether you got a meal to eat
[56:14] it's whether you're born again
[56:18] but I've never been one too that like to
[56:23] you know say well okay we'll go this way
[56:26] but if it don't work out then we'll cry
[56:28] out for it later
[56:30] I've always told you what I believe
[56:32] I'd rather go through life
[56:36] seeking God
[56:40] asking him am I Born Again
[56:45] and wind up at the end of it and him
[56:47] tell me I already had it and to go
[56:49] through life and not seeking it because
[56:51] of my great religious thing that I am
[56:54] you know
[56:55] I believe the message I believe all the
[56:58] prophets said I believe everything
[57:00] and find out one day he'll say depart
[57:03] from me I never knew you
[57:05] because you know right then where you're
[57:06] going that's right
[57:10] this thing is not to be played with
[57:12] right
[57:16] the message is perfect
[57:18] amen amen
[57:22] you see we need to be the people as I
[57:24] was covering this morning of the
[57:26] prophetic people to believe the
[57:28] prophetic message that's right now
[57:33] put a stand and say the prophet said
[57:36] amen
[57:39] I don't like these things you know what
[57:42] is your input on this
[57:45] I don't like that word
[57:48] cause that simple
[57:51] looking about and you don't either so
[57:53] let's talk about her inputs
[57:56] what do you think and I'll compare it
[57:58] with what I think
[58:04] I'll tell you what I believe not where I
[58:07] stand right
[58:09] like that that I'm sorry
[58:13] I don't want to be the truth
[58:15] to stand one day and be able to present
[58:18] a group of people to Jesus Christ
[58:22] right you say I taught you the word yeah
[58:24] yeah
[58:26] see not just left it to where you
[58:28] flip-flums in backwards and forth
[58:30] you know
[58:31] trying to find everything you can you
[58:33] notice the people of this message you've
[58:35] got a young man rise up he's got a
[58:37] little leadership you know a little bit
[58:38] of an anointing about him a little bit
[58:40] of persuasive preaching in fact and the
[58:43] people the message just run to it
[58:47] and they run the boy they listen this is
[58:48] it this is it
[58:51] after a while you see him kind of fading
[58:52] away may go find him another one
[58:57] that away
[59:00] two
[59:02] that's a great thing for us
[59:05] to realize
[59:07] and I wish I was the type of preacher
[59:09] that could preach
[59:11] you remember the man Brothers somebody
[59:13] told it that the man was preaching about
[59:16] being on a ship and it was sinking you
[59:19] know you know
[59:20] he preached it so
[59:24] captivating until the guy jumped up and
[59:27] hollered man alive folks
[59:29] you know they just got so involved I
[59:31] wish I could do that
[59:34] I wish I could preach hell and it so
[59:36] horrible until no one would want to go
[59:38] there
[59:39] hmm
[59:41] I wish I could preach his six seal
[59:44] and so horrible events that would take
[59:46] place
[59:47] it would scare the children to even
[59:49] think of it
[59:52] but never found anybody
[59:54] that got converted off of that type of
[59:56] preaching
[59:58] right now you tell me you did right
[1:00:03] that ain't gonna hold you that's right
[1:00:07] some of the revealed words
[1:00:12] you shall know the truth right not a
[1:00:14] truth right
[1:00:16] I'll set you free that's right amen
[1:00:20] what about we see
[1:00:23] most of us now are beginning to fall
[1:00:27] there are sometimes as much as a
[1:00:29] baseball or even on a rare occasion as
[1:00:32] much as a softball
[1:00:33] this beats everything to pieces
[1:00:37] but what about in the tribulation and a
[1:00:39] block of ice will weigh 90 pounds
[1:00:43] that's right
[1:00:46] you see when I get on the bridge
[1:00:50] I didn't plan on falling out of the sky
[1:00:52] the biggest problem is you ain't gonna
[1:00:55] be under the bridge
[1:00:57] the bridge is going to be on top of you
[1:00:59] you know
[1:01:02] but yet that's going to take place
[1:01:05] he said I don't see how in the world I
[1:01:07] can happen
[1:01:08] is because we fool with nature so much
[1:01:11] until we messed it all up
[1:01:15] and it can happen
[1:01:18] The Way of All of Us forms it
[1:01:20] it starts down this
[1:01:23] you know beginning to form
[1:01:26] and that raises back up
[1:01:30] and comes back down again and each time
[1:01:33] it does it's increasing its size
[1:01:38] so you fool around with those things out
[1:01:40] there like like science has and you got
[1:01:42] it all messed up
[1:01:46] we're creating our own death you
[1:01:48] remember the prophet
[1:01:50] God don't kill nobody
[1:01:53] God didn't cause the flood man caused
[1:01:56] the flood
[1:01:57] yeah right
[1:01:58] because my Bible says God yeah that's
[1:02:01] true what reads your profit man your
[1:02:04] Prophet explains that God didn't do it
[1:02:07] man did that that's right
[1:02:10] nuclear destructions and things told the
[1:02:12] Earth
[1:02:13] catered to where this wobbly
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:20] what about a horrible life
[1:02:22] you think of the most sickening thing
[1:02:24] you could think of in your life
[1:02:27] put an animal to be able to eat off your
[1:02:29] body before you die
[1:02:33] that's the tribulation
[1:02:38] but we don't have to go there because we
[1:02:39] go up in a wretch
[1:02:43] I'm not doing it then it's left to
[1:02:46] someone else we'll go to the number 11
[1:02:47] now bro
[1:02:50] I got 190 of the six sealed
[1:02:53] and he says this six healed is a
[1:02:57] tribulation period
[1:02:58] that's what takes place
[1:03:00] the bride is gone see
[1:03:03] there's no living creature nothing can
[1:03:05] nothing there to say it it's just now
[1:03:08] God is not dealing with the church no
[1:03:10] more
[1:03:11] it's been gone he's been with Israel see
[1:03:14] you see this is the other side this is
[1:03:17] when Israel receives the message of the
[1:03:20] Kingdom
[1:03:21] by the two prophets of Revelation 11.
[1:03:24] remember Israel is a nation
[1:03:27] God's servant Nation
[1:03:29] when and when when Israel is brought in
[1:03:31] it'll be a national Affair Israel the
[1:03:35] kingdom age is where David the son of
[1:03:37] David
[1:03:39] says on the throne now that goes on into
[1:03:41] the Millennium right
[1:03:43] all right
[1:03:45] we said it's brought in by these two
[1:03:46] Prophets
[1:03:48] now let's read that scripture
[1:03:51] of Revelations 11.
[1:03:53] go ahead and put it up right
[1:04:00] Revelation 11 which is number 12 on your
[1:04:02] notes
[1:04:07] I got it over this time the Jimmy head
[1:04:09] of me
[1:04:13] I appreciate these brothers
[1:04:17] you'd be surprised what we do sometimes
[1:04:19] because we Shuffle books back there
[1:04:21] because I changed it right in the middle
[1:04:23] of the course and go running in there
[1:04:25] they put 11a and 11b you know I'm done
[1:04:29] changing everything because all right
[1:04:31] but watch what he says and brother
[1:04:33] around said these are the two Prophets
[1:04:35] in Revelations 11. all right now watch
[1:04:38] it
[1:04:39] and that was given unto me I really like
[1:04:41] them under like them to A rod an angel
[1:04:45] still saying rise and measure the temple
[1:04:46] of God and the Altar and build that
[1:04:48] worship Larry but the court which is
[1:04:50] without the temple leaves out and
[1:04:52] measure it not but he's given under the
[1:04:54] Gentiles and the holy city shall be
[1:04:56] destroyed Under Foot 40 in two months
[1:04:59] all right yep yeah and I will get power
[1:05:02] unto my two witnesses
[1:05:05] bless your prophesy a thousand two
[1:05:07] hundred three score days which is 42
[1:05:10] months because you're back to 30 days to
[1:05:12] a month right all right
[1:05:15] these are the two olive trees goes all
[1:05:17] the way back over
[1:05:18] Zechariah
[1:05:21] and they're two candlesticks standing
[1:05:22] before the god of the Earth
[1:05:25] and if any man hurt them fire proceeded
[1:05:27] out of their mouth
[1:05:28] and devour their enemies and if any man
[1:05:31] shall hurt them he must in this manner
[1:05:34] be killed
[1:05:35] please have power to shut Heaven Let It
[1:05:38] Rain not in the days of their prophecy
[1:05:42] do you think about it
[1:05:46] if it was nothing but just
[1:05:51] being
[1:05:52] three and a half years without water
[1:05:59] now where would it be anything
[1:06:02] to be able to survive
[1:06:05] right
[1:06:09] you better hope they can create water
[1:06:11] one of these days right these have power
[1:06:13] that shits Heaven that it rained on the
[1:06:15] days of their prophecy we know that's
[1:06:17] like Moses and Elijah
[1:06:19] our old Waters to turn into blood this
[1:06:22] might be Earth with plagues as often as
[1:06:24] they will
[1:06:28] think about it
[1:06:31] we'll read or think about it the minute
[1:06:33] we get down to it
[1:06:35] you know that when these two prophets
[1:06:36] are killed
[1:06:38] they actually send notes around the
[1:06:42] world and
[1:06:43] celebrate right
[1:06:46] because their enemy is dead
[1:06:49] and you think about it
[1:06:52] your baby is starving to death and it's
[1:06:55] nine of thirsts
[1:07:00] and you got a pool of water
[1:07:02] and Moses and Elijah walks by and it
[1:07:05] says blood
[1:07:06] let's turn to blood
[1:07:09] ain't no good to hardly drink blood is
[1:07:11] it
[1:07:14] see they get to the bases that they're
[1:07:16] hated
[1:07:18] yep
[1:07:20] for three and a half years
[1:07:22] they played him
[1:07:24] with the voice of God
[1:07:26] for three and a half years
[1:07:33] as a human being you'd want them taken
[1:07:35] out of the way
[1:07:38] right
[1:07:43] but you know what's so horrible to think
[1:07:45] about how caramel it could be
[1:07:48] you know it was stated that when brother
[1:07:49] Brown passed on
[1:07:53] the sun said our enemy is gone
[1:07:59] for sure
[1:08:00] you think you wouldn't be that way
[1:08:04] you get hungry you'll do anything
[1:08:08] you'll eat each other
[1:08:18] it would be better go on a diet
[1:08:21] because maybe they want to eat the
[1:08:23] bigger ones first
[1:08:25] then that gets you the last quit open
[1:08:28] but listen they can Smite the Earth
[1:08:31] anytime they want to
[1:08:34] yep and then when they finish their
[1:08:36] testimony
[1:08:39] three and a half years
[1:08:41] they preach 42 months we just read it
[1:08:47] what happened the beasts that ascended
[1:08:49] out of the bottomless pit you'll make
[1:08:51] war against them and she'll overcome
[1:08:53] them and kill them
[1:08:56] is it over with
[1:08:58] no
[1:09:00] you know within
[1:09:03] and their dead body shall on the street
[1:09:05] of the great city which is spiritually
[1:09:07] call Sodom and Angel
[1:09:09] where our Lord was crucified in other
[1:09:11] words of Jerusalem
[1:09:12] they're the people in Kindred and cons
[1:09:15] and Nations shall see their dead bodies
[1:09:17] three days and a high and shall not
[1:09:20] suffer their dead bodies to be put in
[1:09:23] Graves
[1:09:24] right
[1:09:26] they that dwell upon the Earth shall
[1:09:28] rejoice over them
[1:09:31] how horrible can anyone be
[1:09:33] and make Mary and she'll send gifts one
[1:09:36] to the other because those two Prophets
[1:09:40] tormented them that dwell on the earth
[1:09:41] and they're gone see
[1:09:44] all right
[1:09:46] and after three days and a half
[1:09:49] Spirit of Life coming from God into them
[1:09:52] life from God innocent do that
[1:09:55] and they stood on their feet
[1:09:58] and great fear came on them which saw
[1:10:00] them
[1:10:02] is it over yet no
[1:10:05] and they heard a great voice from Heaven
[1:10:07] saying
[1:10:08] the two witnesses right come up hither
[1:10:11] and they'll send it up to heaven in the
[1:10:12] cloud and their enemies behold them
[1:10:15] you say it won't be a lot of repentance
[1:10:19] who will it do any good
[1:10:23] you send gifts around and all of you
[1:10:27] Rejoice because your enemy's gone
[1:10:30] and all at once he raised it up from the
[1:10:32] dead
[1:10:33] you think it won't be screaming and
[1:10:34] hollering and trying to repent but it
[1:10:37] wouldn't do any good no
[1:10:39] dance when they're going to cry from the
[1:10:41] rocks to fall on them that we ran over
[1:10:44] in Revelation
[1:10:46] why because in the same hour there was a
[1:10:49] great earthquake
[1:10:50] and the tenth part of the city fell
[1:10:53] and in the earthquake they were slain of
[1:10:55] men seven thousand and the remnant were
[1:10:58] frightened and gave glory to the god of
[1:11:00] Heaven I want to say it this morning and
[1:11:02] only seven thousand
[1:11:04] two hundred thousand died just recently
[1:11:06] over there
[1:11:08] but you see the Bible is specific
[1:11:13] the part of the city fell in seven
[1:11:15] thousand goes there is your truth
[1:11:20] are you following me I love it like that
[1:11:22] the word that you can look at it and see
[1:11:25] it
[1:11:26] and comprehend
[1:11:29] see Jesus saw these things
[1:11:32] and he spoke of it
[1:11:34] yep
[1:11:36] Matthew 24.
[1:11:37] and we covered this morning
[1:11:39] Jesus spoke of this great
[1:11:42] six seals
[1:11:45] and he was writing so let's read that
[1:11:47] Matthew
[1:11:49] will go to 11a
[1:11:58] which is paragraph 184 or 185
[1:12:01] of The Sixth Seal
[1:12:05] it's perfectly turned right back over
[1:12:07] see what Jesus said here in Matthew 24
[1:12:10] 29 listen after this this Eichmann case
[1:12:14] since you're working immediately after
[1:12:16] the tribulation of those days which is
[1:12:18] the minor tribulation we're going
[1:12:19] through now the pre-tribulation
[1:12:22] immediately after the tribulation is no
[1:12:24] day no say shall the sun be darkened the
[1:12:27] moon shall not shall not give her life
[1:12:29] Stars shall fall from Heaven the powers
[1:12:32] of Heaven shall be shaken and watched
[1:12:34] and then there's the Earth shall appear
[1:12:36] the sign
[1:12:39] what
[1:12:41] other son of man in heaven
[1:12:45] and they shall see and they that then
[1:12:48] shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
[1:12:51] they shall see the son of man coming in
[1:12:53] the Clouds Of Heaven with great power
[1:12:55] and Glory
[1:12:57] and he'll send forth his angels and they
[1:12:59] will gather with the trumpet
[1:13:02] but now we were this morning
[1:13:06] talking about the Luke 17 30.
[1:13:09] why would it be brought in about the son
[1:13:11] of man in the end time
[1:13:14] see then we know the message is brought
[1:13:17] To Us by the prophet of God
[1:13:21] who had the son of man Ministry
[1:13:25] but then it's going to leave us and go
[1:13:27] to Israel
[1:13:30] brother said that that anointing off of
[1:13:32] the Gentile bride
[1:13:35] will go to Israel
[1:13:39] he says Israel I'm quoting if you want
[1:13:42] to eat he said Israel will see God
[1:13:45] coming after you and I
[1:13:49] and thanks they're coming after them
[1:13:53] let's go
[1:13:56] the son of man what is the sign of the
[1:13:59] son of man
[1:14:05] we know the son of man
[1:14:08] does not step on Earth until the
[1:14:10] millennial reign in a Corporal body you
[1:14:12] agree with that statement do you need it
[1:14:15] it's in the Millennium when he's
[1:14:17] standing on Earth in that Corporal body
[1:14:19] yes right all right so this this is not
[1:14:23] a Corporal body
[1:14:26] this is through the two prophets right
[1:14:29] because they're bringing the son of man
[1:14:31] ministry right that's it
[1:14:35] good around said when I saw that
[1:14:40] he said I got up and walked out of the
[1:14:42] room
[1:14:47] why would you talk back
[1:14:51] he said they have the power to shut
[1:14:53] heaven
[1:14:55] then call down plagues
[1:15:00] he said God they have the word of the
[1:15:02] Lord
[1:15:04] we'll get back on that one
[1:15:07] when the prophet said he went out of the
[1:15:09] room why don't you think he could see
[1:15:11] what was in his ministry
[1:15:14] don't you see he knew what was taking
[1:15:16] place in his ministry
[1:15:20] there through the two prophets won't be
[1:15:23] a televised uh picture in the sky
[1:15:28] oh the son of man
[1:15:31] is what we want to get all into that and
[1:15:33] try to visualize which is making sense
[1:15:35] to me
[1:15:37] you know that brother Reynolds says he
[1:15:38] won't be here in a Corporal body for the
[1:15:40] money
[1:15:42] but he says he'll be visible Among Us
[1:15:44] and raise the dead and we're going to
[1:15:45] rapture now
[1:15:48] is that a contradiction no
[1:15:52] visible to you and I
[1:15:56] won't be a great big halo son of man in
[1:15:59] the skies
[1:16:03] give me two prophets standing there with
[1:16:04] the word
[1:16:05] that's right
[1:16:08] I didn't close heaven to do what they
[1:16:09] want to
[1:16:13] it's not the son of man
[1:16:17] it's the sound of the son of man
[1:16:20] the son of man it's a word make flesh
[1:16:23] yes right
[1:16:25] them two Prophets
[1:16:27] are so close
[1:16:30] you know that run around and even said
[1:16:32] they were that sexy
[1:16:33] you need that quote
[1:16:36] Rich you feel good there's a lot of
[1:16:37] things in there you know
[1:16:38] what about you know what do I encourage
[1:16:41] you to do
[1:16:43] I'm encourage you to read to see a book
[1:16:46] to see what he's talking to you
[1:16:50] even through the symbols of the one two
[1:16:54] three and four
[1:16:56] well did you just know the Antichrist
[1:17:01] yep
[1:17:02] I wanted to know
[1:17:04] Jesus Christ in our Homer in opposition
[1:17:08] of the Antichrist
[1:17:09] I encourage you to read the seal book
[1:17:14] even told you a word that I got into the
[1:17:16] sealed and read them
[1:17:19] when I got to the seventh seal it seemed
[1:17:22] so much that he was speaking of his own
[1:17:24] self
[1:17:25] do I begin to have problems
[1:17:30] I knew it was my problems not his if it
[1:17:33] was God's Prophet so I went back to the
[1:17:35] church age book and I studied it for
[1:17:37] years and years
[1:17:42] but then when I began to see
[1:17:45] what it is right you're listening while
[1:17:48] ago you call the key of it when
[1:17:50] fifth seal and six seal opens
[1:17:54] he's just simply telling us what that is
[1:17:58] right you only do them with symbols
[1:18:02] right amen see they see according to
[1:18:06] Matthew which brother Reynolds is going
[1:18:08] down and read it
[1:18:10] see just exactly comparing what Jesus
[1:18:12] said in Matthew 24 and what the
[1:18:14] Revelation here Revelator here open up
[1:18:17] the new Sixth Seal
[1:18:18] is just exactly and Jesus was speaking
[1:18:21] of the tribulation period
[1:18:25] all right
[1:18:27] is he putting them together you could
[1:18:28] see that there's
[1:18:31] the sound of the son of man
[1:18:36] the word through two Prophets
[1:18:40] and if you'll notice on what we're
[1:18:41] reading on the scripture this is already
[1:18:44] after they're killed
[1:18:46] does that make any problem
[1:18:51] did Brother random say
[1:18:56] California would go under one day
[1:18:59] you agree with that yeah
[1:19:02] well you know that went yeah right right
[1:19:05] but is that anything to do with it no no
[1:19:08] because it will why
[1:19:10] why would it go under because he said it
[1:19:13] go under that's right
[1:19:15] he didn't say New York
[1:19:20] he didn't say Arizona he said California
[1:19:24] go under well the word has been spoken
[1:19:28] all right
[1:19:29] you cannot return unto the god void
[1:19:32] those two witnesses call down plagues
[1:19:36] in the Bible we just read fire proceeds
[1:19:39] out of their mouth and right after
[1:19:41] breathing dragons
[1:19:44] sailing
[1:19:46] no better than the Baptist Church man
[1:19:49] what's wrong with this church right
[1:19:51] it's the word out of their mouth all
[1:19:54] right amen the prophet said it would let
[1:19:56] fire in my bosom
[1:20:02] he said how can I not speak
[1:20:07] do those two prophets will call that
[1:20:09] word down they'll just whatever they
[1:20:10] call that's the way it'll be
[1:20:12] till the people just get to where they
[1:20:14] hate them
[1:20:17] laughs
[1:20:18] you know what God has to permit in two
[1:20:21] flowers to be killed because how could
[1:20:23] you kill them
[1:20:26] you ever notice about Jesus
[1:20:28] foreign
[1:20:40] what happened he didn't zap them
[1:20:45] he just turned all around well time
[1:20:48] you know what they're doing is hunting
[1:20:49] Barn right yeah the word the guy we
[1:20:53] brought out here to go off the mountain
[1:20:56] he just walked out
[1:20:58] do those two prophets cannot be touched
[1:21:03] until their things of their Ministry
[1:21:06] you know what I love about that
[1:21:09] the same Prophet said those things says
[1:21:12] Satan can't get you until God is through
[1:21:15] with you amen
[1:21:17] what are you afraid of you right
[1:21:22] Brazil you afraid to die I'm more afraid
[1:21:24] of living
[1:21:29] 's got more problems than died
[1:21:33] what'd you see
[1:21:35] he can't touch you and listen the other
[1:21:37] day to a date I love to do that down the
[1:21:40] woods you don't understand you're going
[1:21:41] to be there for hours trying to find a
[1:21:43] deer because I sleep sometimes you know
[1:21:45] but
[1:21:47] at least that's why I don't kill anyone
[1:21:51] listen to a doctor three or four tanks
[1:21:53] and I was listening to Brett random was
[1:21:55] talking the other day about
[1:21:57] those type of things life
[1:22:03] and he said he said God took a picture
[1:22:05] of you
[1:22:06] one day
[1:22:09] and said he turned around to Satan and
[1:22:11] says
[1:22:12] come on
[1:22:15] you can take it
[1:22:17] but since you can't take his life
[1:22:21] amen and I'll tell you when
[1:22:25] these two prophets could not be touched
[1:22:27] until God was through with them
[1:22:32] when he was through with him
[1:22:35] that Beast rose up and killed him
[1:22:43] God used to with you Satan can take you
[1:22:46] but until then he can't take you
[1:22:50] all right don't worry about it right
[1:22:53] can you please ruined I won't go
[1:22:57] right right well you want to hang around
[1:23:01] pure I love life but
[1:23:03] I love him but think about it now
[1:23:08] good profits
[1:23:10] during a three and a half year period
[1:23:14] claim the world with their voice
[1:23:16] right
[1:23:18] fire like out of their mouth
[1:23:21] when they speak it
[1:23:23] it's just go down let's see it
[1:23:26] you can't do nothing about it
[1:23:31] let's see
[1:23:33] they've got to be taken somewhere so
[1:23:36] they will be killed
[1:23:41] their bodies will lay in the street for
[1:23:42] three and a half days which will
[1:23:43] probably rotten pretty good
[1:23:46] with our especially
[1:23:49] and then wind up
[1:23:51] yep
[1:23:52] being resurrected brought up you stand
[1:23:55] upon the Earth and then God's voice
[1:23:57] calls them up and that's your rapture
[1:23:58] the last one that run around the spoke
[1:24:01] up
[1:24:02] to be the two witnesses going up in a
[1:24:05] ranch
[1:24:06] all right
[1:24:08] their work is finished
[1:24:10] but things are not done
[1:24:13] put us in the same hour
[1:24:15] Revelations 11 13. that was a great
[1:24:19] earthquake yeah
[1:24:22] horrible things starts happening
[1:24:27] Virginia this world and the things
[1:24:29] getting ready for the millennial reign
[1:24:32] but listen Church
[1:24:35] this is what I love about our prophet
[1:24:38] he just didn't tell us about the
[1:24:40] tribulation he just didn't tell us about
[1:24:42] the quirks the earthquakes the the Sun
[1:24:45] going into these things happening
[1:24:47] he told us
[1:24:49] go ahead and go to number 13 let's get
[1:24:51] started on a field and then he'll quit
[1:24:56] this is the Sixth Seal paragraph 317.
[1:24:59] here it is
[1:25:01] here it is in the tribulation period
[1:25:05] in your stands in prophets who has
[1:25:07] control of the word
[1:25:09] that God gives them I love that
[1:25:12] you read that sometimes you think
[1:25:14] control of the word that God gives them
[1:25:18] me
[1:25:20] is it not the spoken word
[1:25:23] all right
[1:25:24] gods
[1:25:26] they're temporarily the Emmett
[1:25:28] maturely let it work they are because
[1:25:31] Jesus said they were said you call him
[1:25:34] God sent him the word of God comes to
[1:25:38] what's the matter he's fixing to take
[1:25:39] the 144 000. out for Redemption out of
[1:25:43] the book of redemption and that's under
[1:25:45] the Seal of redemption and The Sixth
[1:25:48] Seal that's it my dear friends that's
[1:25:51] the Sixth Seal our drove mysteriously
[1:25:55] the tribulation
[1:25:58] and 144 000 is going to be called out
[1:26:03] the mysterious part
[1:26:08] is what
[1:26:11] go ahead number 14.
[1:26:13] this is the bridge between the churches
[1:26:15] and seal paragraph 23.
[1:26:17] Church goes up on the third chapter of
[1:26:19] Revelation and does not return until the
[1:26:21] 19th Chapter of Revelation therefore the
[1:26:23] church misses the tribulation
[1:26:25] I know that's contrary to pretty near
[1:26:27] every teacher I've talked to
[1:26:31] but I don't mean to be disagreeable
[1:26:34] I mean to be your brother but I must
[1:26:36] teach just as I can see it if I don't I
[1:26:39] can't put it together you see and now
[1:26:41] whether it goes up I love what he says
[1:26:43] see before the tribulation interact with
[1:26:45] the tribulation I want to go up with it
[1:26:47] and that's the main value right amen but
[1:26:51] see we don't have to go through the
[1:26:52] tribulation
[1:26:53] and when we heard these things good
[1:26:55] going to hear them again
[1:26:58] go to the next one 15. right around 79
[1:27:01] the first seal
[1:27:04] and how can a man save
[1:27:08] that the bride of Christ goes into the
[1:27:10] tribulation
[1:27:13] I can't understand it
[1:27:16] she stuck away from the tribulation
[1:27:19] if the church had been judged
[1:27:21] lived and they have judged themselves
[1:27:25] and have accepted the blood how can God
[1:27:28] judge a man that's perfectly totally
[1:27:30] sinless
[1:27:32] amazing
[1:27:34] question
[1:27:36] you say
[1:27:38] there's no such person
[1:27:41] jump up or sticker went down said I'm
[1:27:44] not perfect I'm just forgiven

[1:27:53] I'm just forgiving hey if you're
[1:27:56] forgiven you're perfect
[1:27:59] get a little sense
[1:28:01] right
[1:28:03] if I don't have anybody that gets me how
[1:28:05] can I be kelp
[1:28:07] right my dad's been he died in 1945. you
[1:28:11] want to try for some crime for me
[1:28:13] admitted yesterday
[1:28:15] not quite
[1:28:17] he ain't guilty
[1:28:20] did not run around and say an invisible
[1:28:22] Union
[1:28:25] it's not that you're just forgiven
[1:28:29] he said you're Justified
[1:28:32] first statement is what
[1:28:35] he says no you've never done it right
[1:28:37] amen finish it up the message saying the
[1:28:40] real you never did do it
[1:28:42] that's right who can be perfect
[1:28:45] every morning again believer
[1:28:47] okay
[1:28:50] let's read
[1:28:51] he's American such person
[1:28:54] never born again believer True Believer
[1:28:57] is cold perfectly totally seal this
[1:29:00] before God
[1:29:03] he's not trusting these works
[1:29:06] what's he trusting you in the blood
[1:29:08] Jesus died Christ had his confession
[1:29:10] drops into
[1:29:12] it now let's back up and seal
[1:29:16] you remember what we were teaching under
[1:29:17] the fifth seal
[1:29:21] the Bible says that
[1:29:24] they received white robes before now
[1:29:26] read your Bible
[1:29:27] ready to feel single he says they were
[1:29:30] given white robes before the 144
[1:29:33] thousand to kill
[1:29:39] so then with that conclusion in mind
[1:29:43] it means I feel you don't go to the
[1:29:46] tribulation
[1:29:48] he said well that's true because he's
[1:29:49] dead
[1:29:50] she don't go to the watch when I need to
[1:29:52] show me a scripture show me a quote from
[1:29:54] Brother Brown
[1:29:57] I don't care what you think
[1:30:00] I used to play contrary too I used to
[1:30:03] think they had to go to the white throne
[1:30:05] until I read the Bible
[1:30:12] where are you gonna put that fifth
[1:30:13] sealed you
[1:30:14] into white throne for what
[1:30:17] when they already have white room
[1:30:20] my robes is eternal life
[1:30:28] the only one don't get eternal life into
[1:30:30] my Throne is going to be the foolish
[1:30:31] Mercury right right man you know 144 000
[1:30:34] don't go to the left throne
[1:30:37] brother says they go to the Millennium
[1:30:39] and it's you next to the bride right
[1:30:42] need to quote
[1:30:44] Church Blue
[1:30:48] like about it
[1:30:52] if God don't send a foolish uh
[1:30:55] official Jew and a 144 000 to the white
[1:30:59] throne
[1:31:02] right
[1:31:03] and you say you're the bride
[1:31:06] you say you have accepted Jesus Christ
[1:31:08] as your savior you say that God has come
[1:31:11] and lived in your heart
[1:31:15] according to the Book of John it says
[1:31:17] he's sineth not
[1:31:20] because your seat remaineth in him and
[1:31:22] how can he sin
[1:31:30] the Bible says
[1:31:32] so see he that that is born of God does
[1:31:35] not commit sin for he cannot sin how can
[1:31:38] you make a man a sinner when the bleach
[1:31:40] of the blood of Jesus Christ is between
[1:31:41] him and God that would scatter sin
[1:31:43] through God will there be nothing left
[1:31:46] of it see how can that pure blood of
[1:31:49] Jesus of Christ ever let his sin pass
[1:31:51] there he cannot Jesus said to you
[1:31:54] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:31:56] Heaven is perfect
[1:31:57] how could we ever start the thought of
[1:32:00] being perfect but Jesus required it and
[1:32:03] in Jesus required it he's got to make a
[1:32:05] way for her yeah right and he has his
[1:32:09] own blood amen
[1:32:12] amen that's the reason we don't go to
[1:32:13] the tribulation
[1:32:18] go remain perfect
[1:32:21] he said I don't see how anybody can
[1:32:24] say that the bride he's in other Church
[1:32:29] he said because it's typing
[1:32:32] three
[1:32:34] Noah rode up and went over
[1:32:38] right
[1:32:39] right Enoch went into rapture
[1:32:43] before them
[1:32:45] for one thing ever struck Enoch went
[1:32:47] into Rapture
[1:32:49] Noah wrote up went over come back down
[1:32:51] died drunk
[1:32:56] how can you put to church
[1:33:00] the tribulation
[1:33:02] man whoa brother they'll ask you know
[1:33:04] why because you've always been taught
[1:33:08] you've been caught by organized religion
[1:33:12] amen right
[1:33:14] in the teaching they taught was we're
[1:33:17] not perfect
[1:33:19] we're just forgive
[1:33:29] we're going to have to
[1:33:31] I'm teaching I'm saying what they're
[1:33:32] teaching
[1:33:33] not the truth we're all going to have to
[1:33:36] stand at that white throne and give an
[1:33:39] account
[1:33:43] I never hear him say that happened
[1:33:45] what was that
[1:33:49] I sure heard him yeah
[1:33:51] right
[1:33:53] maybe it's gone I was listening because
[1:33:56] you know what
[1:33:57] my soul is involved in what I hear
[1:34:02] so is yours
[1:34:07] we're not going to the watchroom
[1:34:08] judgment
[1:34:11] not because we're going to sit on the
[1:34:13] throne with him
[1:34:15] isn't that wonderful to find out that
[1:34:17] truth
[1:34:19] to find out if we
[1:34:21] go to the watchroom
[1:34:23] find out we don't have to go through the
[1:34:25] tribulation
[1:34:29] to find out how perfect these man is
[1:34:35] now I've left out a whole lot but I'll
[1:34:37] wind up get it back later
[1:34:39] but I want to get one point in mind
[1:34:42] if we believe
[1:34:45] the prophet
[1:34:47] they said the bride goes up in
[1:34:49] Revelation 4 1 and not seen till 1921.
[1:34:53] all right
[1:34:57] then we don't have to go through the
[1:34:58] tribulation amen
[1:35:03] were made perfect by the blood of Jesus
[1:35:05] Christ amen amen
[1:35:07] now
[1:35:08] you remember about
[1:35:10] 20 messages ago so I guess you can't
[1:35:13] come in with that good but
[1:35:15] when it was on Revelations 5.
[1:35:18] and you know they asked a question to
[1:35:20] brother Bradley said
[1:35:21] is this the bride of Christ you remember
[1:35:23] and he said no
[1:35:27] why because his mind was thinking
[1:35:30] the bride goes up at 4-1 and not seen
[1:35:33] till 1921.
[1:35:36] he said it's Israel
[1:35:42] brother Ned Allison brother Brandon
[1:35:45] read your question over
[1:35:48] read your scripture you went back and
[1:35:50] read it he said see there
[1:35:53] I would have
[1:35:54] he said Daddy it's the bride in glory
[1:35:56] right
[1:36:01] yeah
[1:36:02] massive Pride and Glory chapter five
[1:36:08] calls us priests and kings
[1:36:11] all right
[1:36:13] already in glory
[1:36:17] he said see I was wrong
[1:36:20] God wouldn't let him say that would he
[1:36:25] because it was too much hands down
[1:36:29] because you see Church
[1:36:31] if we're not in Revelations 5
[1:36:34] we could be in Revelation 6. right
[1:36:38] you understand the way I said that if
[1:36:41] we're not in Revelation 5 and going up
[1:36:43] in a Rapture and are sitting around the
[1:36:46] throne but all of this is taking place
[1:36:48] down here we gonna be down here that's
[1:36:50] right
[1:36:54] right you know what I mean by that
[1:37:03] what he thinks of us
[1:37:08] you don't show this globally
[1:37:12] you know what I like
[1:37:14] before he even wrote the church ages
[1:37:16] about us
[1:37:18] you agree that was about us
[1:37:22] he said in chapter one there was one
[1:37:25] standing in the midst of seven gold
[1:37:27] again to the son of man gird about the
[1:37:30] pouch for the golden girdle run around
[1:37:32] and said see there and all that was the
[1:37:33] bride
[1:37:34] before he brought anything in the Book
[1:37:37] of Revelation he showed us
[1:37:40] eternal
[1:37:41] now you tell me that ain't perfect
[1:37:43] amen
[1:37:47] I'm not looking at what I do or don't do
[1:37:49] it I'm looking at Jesus Christ
[1:37:53] he wasn't what you've done or didn't do
[1:37:55] in the Old Testament it's whether or not
[1:37:57] you believe that lamb right
[1:38:00] now everybody took a lamb up there and
[1:38:02] just throwed it down let him kill it her
[1:38:03] sins wasn't covered
[1:38:07] because God had done spoken he said I'm
[1:38:09] sick of your my nostrils
[1:38:12] of your sacrifice and offer let's set an
[1:38:14] honest in a contract heart read your
[1:38:16] Bible
[1:38:18] a man sincerely took his offering up
[1:38:20] there and laid it down and put his hands
[1:38:22] on it yep believe me they took his place
[1:38:27] God forgave him amen right but everybody
[1:38:30] took around I thought it down wasn't
[1:38:31] forgiven
[1:38:35] let's go play games
[1:38:40] we seem to be Christians or get out of
[1:38:41] this thing and leave it alone
[1:38:44] this message one day is my house
[1:38:47] I said why don't you get out of this
[1:38:49] message or get in at one
[1:38:52] I didn't know how to say it you know
[1:38:54] what his wife said you're right brother
[1:38:56] Daley needs to get in or get out
[1:39:04] because you see
[1:39:06] he was stirring up the
[1:39:08] teaching that brought around Was An Old
[1:39:10] Testament prophet in the New Testament
[1:39:11] age
[1:39:12] all of those things
[1:39:15] I was trying to hit me
[1:39:17] he's running around with an Old
[1:39:19] Testament Prophet we're still under the
[1:39:20] law
[1:39:25] but he was a new testament prophet
[1:39:27] greater than all the prophets right
[1:39:30] right he was a church age messenger he
[1:39:33] born again Christian he was Elijah the
[1:39:36] prophet and he was
[1:39:39] I ain't son of man all right man not
[1:39:41] these other man that's the Lord Jesus
[1:39:43] Christ
[1:39:45] like on these things
[1:39:49] it's a great thing to think about
[1:39:54] that we missed the tribulation amen
[1:39:56] right we don't have to go there
[1:40:01] because he's already made us cleansed
[1:40:03] and perfect
[1:40:07] let's Stand Together
[1:40:09] we're going to go into the communion
[1:40:16] no one would be worthy to take the
[1:40:18] communion
[1:40:19] no one is worthy to take the communion
[1:40:22] except
[1:40:24] they be born again right
[1:40:31] my Prophet said it's only for the
[1:40:33] born-again believer
