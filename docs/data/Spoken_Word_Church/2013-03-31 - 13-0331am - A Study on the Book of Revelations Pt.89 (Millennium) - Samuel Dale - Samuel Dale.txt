========================================
oh oh is is my oh service open the eye with my heart my foreign oh amen amen amen good resurrection morning to everybody good to see everybody in the house of the lord you might turn any scriptures turn to revelations 1 where we've been reading in revelations 20. let's remember now that lord willing this coming saturday the easter festival will be down at guildsville it's a city park now not

real bad and and everything the doctors are doing what they can but it still just hits her and then it'll go away a little bit and then come back real hard so remember that remember also wade's

something uh do that you know because it'd be it'll be nice we'll take care of it we won't let any of it go to waste we'll consume it all right so remember that amen heavenly father we thank you for this day and your love unto us we truly thank you for this morning as an example in a time that we can call it a resurrection morning we realize and know that every day is a resurrection to a born again believer but it's just a time that the whole world has set aside and they've had all kind of services today and and all but lord what we need is a resurrection in our hearts and our lives so we just ask you to come on the scene in each one of us and speak to us that we may see you lord and to be god in your understanding forgive our sins because that's what we want to stand complete in you have your way now and just lead us as we read the scripture you come among us and bless us bless those that are sick remember our wife lord and just touch her there and just lord let everything be okay we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen revelations one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show into his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sinned and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now let's go to revelations 20 we read the first seven verses and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into a bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should not deceive the nations no more until the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season and i saw thrones and they that set up on them and judgment was given to them now this is not i'll emphasize here this is not to watch on judgment this is the millennium that we're coming up to and when you get on over in the chapter you'll find the white throne judgment all right and i saw thrones and they that set up on the end of judgment was given them to them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had worshipped the beast which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years was finished this is the first resurrection blessed is blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection on such the second death have no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years and when the thousand years were expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison he may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've been studying for quite a while in the book of revelations and reaching to this position uh i'm trying today to take a couple of messages that will be basically relating to the uh easter time which we call the resurrection time and in that you know uh the resurrection of 2000 years ago was a wonderful opportunity a wonderful thing to happen to where that mankind you know could uh receive the new birth to life and be raised out of his things of life and beings but if we don't have a resurrection today amen you know being raised paul wanted to be part of an out you remember there in the scripture and see brought around explaining that it's not that he didn't believe in the resurrection he believed in it and he had experienced it by the new birth but he wanted an out resurrection out from among ideas and thoughts of mankind or you know denominationalisms or whatever you want to call it for our day we'll see that's what we need we need an out resurrection we we cherish and think about the resurrection back there but if that resurrection is not real here as we'll pick up this afternoon on the first resurrection and talking about it if if that's not still going on then we've got a problem we've stopped somewhere we've denominated we've died whatever you want to call it uh but uh i was at one i'll reach a little while the prophet said i'm a firm believer in the millennial reign but see if there hadn't been a resurrection there would never have been a millennial right see it's all hinged upon the resurrection everything is life all of it whatever we are is hinged upon the resurrection all right and then being on to that part we need to think more about it and we will this afternoon get back onto the thought but we've been for quite a while now in the book of revelations taking it slowly step by step going through the things and basically what we've been covering from chapter four upward uh would be after the rapture because the bride goes up in chapter four we know that and then you know we we look at all of those things and we see them the tribulation period was set in upon israel and while they're at their tribulation period and having that uh by the two witnesses then the bride will be in glory because she's been done taking a rapture she'll be at the wedding of the of the lamb and she'll be being married to christ not that we're not married to him now we are by the new birth that's wonderful but we are going to a wedding in the sky and then a marriage suffer after that wedding and all of that is to take well that's taking place the earth is being uh purged in a form of tribulation falling upon it and then we'll wind up into armageddon and getting ready and seeing those things so all of these things that we've been talking about are future events but we see what it has to do with us you know here in our day in times and what we're looking at it and and seeing then that the bride of jesus christ according to revelations 19 that we've been there it says and his wife has made herself ready well that's what's taking place now is not going on over there you know and some were being made ready because the the actual bride of christ is not seen anymore after revelation on earth let me put it that way they're not seen in an earthly scene after chapter four going to go up in a rapture now we're seeing in chapter five right you know they're and and recognized as priests and kings and and things like that but that's still that's not that's a heavenly scene and that's what's taking place while the earth is getting its purging and and everything and getting ready for the millennial rain right and then the bride has made herself her wife has made herself ready and then we covered then covering on up the last couple of messages how that in revelations 19 that we would see the bridegroom and the bride come riding back together into the millennial reign all right and the millennium is the prophet said paragraph 495 of the future home he said it's it's a honeymoon right we don't come back here to to uh do as a lot of people today we come back here on a honeymoon all right and that honeymoon there can be a lot of things taking place but it's a honeymoon for the for the bride and the groom you know to have some time together to hear but to have something that they can do and they're going to live a thousand years all right all right here on earth but remember we'll be in glorified bodies so it won't matter about the time elements to us you know once we go up in a rapture or you know we're going to be eternal body spirit soul so it won't be a a point of the millennium that we're coming back you know to some form of an earthly something as mortal people now but they will be people here that will be in the mortal realms and things but it will not be the bride because when she goes up in a rapture she just doesn't come back to a natural point she comes back in a supernatural to rule and reign with him for a thousand years all right now in the religious world system there is what's called about the millennium because the millennium will read the minute and go through it it means a thousand all right then you can say millennials and some say that that's what it means there but millennials means thousands but you know we're only going to deal with what we know about the 1000 years because that's what the scripture was reading but there is what's called post-millennium pre-millennium some people believe that back during the catholicism of the ages especially in the the catholic church ruled and reigned for over a thousand years and that's why they come up with a pre-millennial in other words they were having their millennium and they were picking up the tights and the shadows from uh like uh solomon david you know back in their time that there was a thousand years through there that there was a uh a kind of a a utopia on the earth that uh that they didn't have any battles they didn't have any things going on you know and they picked that up and they brought it up and brought it in and said well we're already in the millennium well it's kind of odd some of the believers in the message kind of picked that idea up now and wanted to know asked brother branham somebody didn't said where was the millennium at so we heard it was down here under the under the bridge of jeffersonville we'll see you had the argument of a pre-millennial post-millennial you know one being before meaning it's already transpired and that's the catholic doctrine all right and some are looking forward to the millennium well i i don't think the bride was back there in the dark ages being killed that that was a millennial ring to you i i'm looking forward to a millennium a thousand years to be on earth that i don't have to worry about any problems and people are teaching in the message some now that we're already in the millennium well if this is the millennium i'd sure miss my understanding of the bible right you know i mean i i'm still getting older and and uh you know and um people are having to go to work and slave and do and if this is the millennium i don't know i i don't know whether i'd want anything else you know what i mean no that might be worse no this is pretty bad with the sickness and the heart acts and trouble i always thought in the millennium but that satan as we read there would be bound a thousand years that was my understanding of reading the bible that's what that would be wouldn't have to be interpreted that would be self-explanatory that you could read that he would be bound you know for a thousand years and and it would be a a peaceful time well like i said this is peaceful i sure wouldn't i want something better than this somewhere down the road don't you but that's the way people believe it and that's their thoughts because you're gonna have that as i said just like you got the the pre-millennium you've got millennials and you've got the post-millennials and you've got all kind of all millennials and everything in the world you know that goes on in man's ideas because he just reads something and he tries to put it together well remember that you're reading something that will transpire after you're here you know even in chapter four we see we went up all right then these other things would be happening to israel all right then we come on over in our understandings and we come riding back in revelations 19 the king of kings and lord of lords there this past wednesday trying to to bring a little talk on it you know that when you come to that position you see all of it in bold capital letters and that's the 1909 edition of scofield okay i'll make sure to put that because a lot of people said my bible don't say these things you know because a lot of bibles don't put emphasis upon the wording they're just writing the book but some do in the 1909 version of the scofield it does it and the 1611 does it i checked both of them and you say i've got a 16-11 scofield bible well i would advise you to go look i've got a king james version the king james version was in 1611. but the scofield bible only come out about 1909 somewhere right in there with the beginning of doing that but yet that's where people you know they'll argue with you and they'll tell you but they don't even look and think about i want you to think that's one reason i'm going through the book of revelation i want you to look at the bible and read it for yourself but you have to have an understanding from that of the things that will take place even after we get out of here and gone you know these things will be transpiring and then we see ourselves that's it in chapter 5 in a heavenly scene but then we don't see ourselves until you come over about the 19th chapter and then you can see the wife is getting married and everything taking place and then we come riding back into the millennium on a honeymoon well that's where we pick back up to see our park the other part is to israel and i told you the amazing part of it is all that you read in there and all the preaching i've been going through it's only a three and a half year period of tribulation you know plus whatever happens to israel because there is an extension and going on into the daniel 70 weeks but now think about it so we read here that they'll be a thousand years a thousand years now you think about it a thousand years of perfect peace now this will come to pass because of the resurrection on easter morning now there won't be anybody in the millennium other than the gospel to the heathen and what that is you'll have to go to your prophet he says he'll be there but you know all else will be in eternity won't be having to deal with you know earthly elements we'll get to it in a minute where that we can rule and ring with him and the ruling ring means you gotta have something to rule over so then god is going to do those things and some of that i can't explain and won't try to but we believe it but see why is there going to be a thousand years why is there going to be a millennial rhyme all right you can argue the post in the freeze but people don't they didn't talk about why there's to be one why is there to be a thousand years of perfect peace of earthly time now now it will be 360 days to the year because it will throw the year back the world will fall back into perfect order and it won't be like we are now 365 in the fourth and things but still it'll be a thousand years that somebody's going to live on earth well like i said a moment ago then what are we worried about for because we're eternal beings that's right and we won't be times we won't be uh people of time we won't be that we'll we'll be creatures of eternity so what will it matter to us about the thousand years it won't because we won't even having to be worried about it we'll be actually sitting in the stage when we reach there until when the scripture actually says that that in with the lord a thousand years is how long in one day i mean you take two days ago he was being raised as far as he's concerned well when we come to that position that's all it'll be with us it will make no difference about time we won't having to be well well i gotta go eat i've got to go i've got to do you know it won't be that but to somebody it will to somebody it will be a thousand years that's right all right we read it in a minute to do what to prove the sin curse was gone right that's why the reason for the millennium that's why the thousand years is to show the sin curse is gone but once man failed see that nobody's ever lived a thousand years upon the earth methuselah was 969. now that was the closest time coming to a thousand years but he never made it why because the bible says the day you eat thereof that day you shall die all right let's see that's what missed eva because she still had the carnality she ate took whatever you want to call it and she thought 24 hours later but i didn't die because she was thinking about natural days he was thinking about a thousand years of the day and a day of the thousand years when he said today you eat thereof that day you die see then the bible self-explanatory if we just read it that's why i want you to read the book of revelation for yourself see we were told to stay out of it you know we couldn't understand it but why not i mean is there any problem with 1 000 years i mean you know there's any problem with reading that is there any problem with understanding the different things that we've read it's just bringing it down to simplicity and to see ourselves and to see where we are that's why i tried to take everything in each message at least somewhere in that message try to bring something that relates to you and i now yes right now brother said jesus had the millennium in him yes well he said why did he have the millennium in him because he was the millennium we get this evening he was the resurrection wasn't he he didn't just have the resurrection he was the resurrect he didn't say i've been in the resurrection he said i am the resurrection right but it's going to be interesting when we get down here to find out that the millennium is a first resurrection so we just read in the scriptures but we didn't emphasize that point not then we'll have to get down in to understand when now so think about it we're going to live a thousand years somebody on this earth is going to live one thousand years ago and that is the promise throughout the world the types and the shadows that are said of david solomon and them and their times of peace all of those things mean things to us god worked six thousand years now that it took him six thousand years you could call it a day because he calls it a day which you can take that day that it's called make it a thousand years because what does it matter to an eternal person it's just a statement this is defining what happened on day one day two day three four five six that's all it's doing it's just explaining you know explaining the the creation see then he worked six thousand years or worked six days and he rested the seventh but see nobody ever finished that seventh in the natural right even metusa but remember methuselah came along after the fall so just remember what i'm trying to say see god worked 6 000 years you realize that as far as god is concerned he just got too creative he's not worried about time and doing he just got too creative that's right because he's eternal and see then doing it you don't realize we fell in the rest right we failed in that day it wasn't that today was completed then we failed right no we fell in that rest that he was resting not because he was tired but eternal god doesn't tire but he just done that as a type we'll get two more some of the things this afternoon but as a type all right in doing that then in his rest satan sneaked in and began to pervert so that day wasn't finished man never finished that day of rest in the that part back there see then when he comes over into the creation or the life the fall he surely has never finished a thousand years living but this will make 969. but somebody's going to live a thousand years he said well why do we need that for because god said we would amen you don't want to go you wouldn't like to be on earth a thousand years with no devil i think there's something wrong with you all right amen i mean we'll get a straight jacket and send you somewhere if you wouldn't want it a thousand years on earth and it ain't kind of like the uh who is it i won't say cause like i can't get in my mind but anyhow they believe that we're going to be discord along here today and and all at once god comes and we just go right on doing what we're doing we're just going doing what we're doing and we'll be building cars we'll we'll just go around on building cars but we just reached a happy time but being mad you'll be happy well that's their ideas of it what's your idea i still don't think i'd be too good of a utopia do you he said why would god spend all of the times going through types and shadows and and things to show of why a millennium will have to come he said well we know see because we do we know we've heard the prophet we've heard the prophets say that you know we're going to live a thousand years because the sin curse is gone that's fine but now a thousand years then that seventh day back there when he rested it was never completed or finished because the fall came so it interrupted god's 1000 years it was going to be yes was it okay go ahead but one day i'll come back and we'll have a thousand years to prove the sin curse is gone now wouldn't that be something to be able to live a thousand years without the devil but see remember it's the millennium is the seventh day that there is a type of the millennium to come all right see then as i said and i'll try to run through it in a hurry without taking a lot of time but we know down through the old testament they worked six days and rested to seven you still have the people called a seventh day adventist i think we know that they still have then they have their saturday because that is the seventh day of the week we believe in raising the first day of the week and ongoing but still if you'll understand what i mean in the old testament they would work six years and they would risk the sabbath they would work six days and they would rest a sabbath what about a whole year to just take off from work you know and let the land lay and just live but remember in the sixth year you had to work a little extra because you store a bunch but just think about all of those types of shadows out in the old testament that you read about of them was pointing to a time all of those seventh day speaking off was pointing to a time but you said well it was pointing to jesus christ we're amen we believe that but get the point the seventh day back there as a rest day could only pop the baptism of the holy ghost jesus said come unto me all year labor and heavy lady now i'll give you rest because remember that came on the eighth day the holy ghost never came on the seventh day because see if it had come on the seventh day it would have been finished are you listening you know i'm just putting in a few points just for you to think you know and the holy ghost fell on the seventh day see then that would have completed the rest and paul wouldn't be right when he said he spoke of another day you know but see that seventh day was a type of the baptism of the holy ghost because of the rest that you go into from your own labors but it would really type in the millennial reign because you're still going to be in time in the millennium you hear people saying it and i wonder what they're thinking i don't know what brother rubble said he said the lady of cnn ages ended but now what's he meaning time didn't quit right right time goes on into the millennium that's right because it's a thousand years so you got to listen to what he's saying what's what's he talking about the age cease when the bride is called out but it's to the bride that's right right it's it's not to the world that's right right now see if you're born again christian you're not in the age you're physically humanly living in the age right but by the baptism with the holy ghost you're called out of that into the eighth day by the baptism with the holy ghost no they say physically that won't happen until the future home see when it falls over there come back into a night understand what i'm saying so the end of the millennial reign is to show you that satan is not in control but if we don't have the new birth that takes our soul into the eighth day by the baptism of the holy ghost not our physical body i keep saying that because there's a doctrine of that ideology people saying years ago said we're already in the eighth day well we're already the next day you didn't pass the millennium but the millennium was the seven right does that mean you're already in the future home well like i said well ago if if this is the millennium i've done missed it and certainly if this is the future home i've i've missed it all yeah i mean i thought by that time the devil not only to be bound but by the future home he's supposed to be annihilated all right but just getting some things to think about not to just say we're millennials people that believe this but why do we believe it why do we believe in the millennial reign but just remember now the bride is eternal body spirit and soul in that millennial reign so it really don't matter but it's just a statement or phrase and i like the way the prophet said that he said it's a honeymoon you know he comes after the wedding and the wedding supper and everything and all and then we come back for a honeymoon a special time to be on a honeymoon now if you like we was we couldn't afford a whole lot of it so our honeymoon was one night in a motel and that was all we could afford and i couldn't hardly afford adapt but you know but still it was a honeymoon right there there was a time away from mama and daddy and they couldn't come and knock on the door because the second night we spent at my mother mother-in-law and dad-in-law's house well we was kind of subject to their rules and regulations but we did our one day you know one night as a honeymoon all right maybe some of you took long ones and went on them and done all this at the other you know what i'm getting at then it was a get-together time a learning time now you're thinking the other way okay your mind's going the other way i'm not on that all right i'm not on the living you know getting the sex acts i'm talking about getting together and learning each other so you get your mind up where my mind's at all right now all that other is natural we'll get into the spiritual it's just a time of getting to know each other that's why you know i i'll say it from the day that my wife and i got married we've had a wonderful time learning each other you know someone's been hard to do i guess but at least we've had time to learn each other i mean we we get to work so much we head toward town and i'll say where are you anywhere you want to because you know what i mean where you want to eat right see you just learn each other well that's kind of what the millennium is to be that's right amen while the world is proving the sin curse of god you're not having to prove that it's gone that's right come on if you get the numbers put your numbers in the right order see it wouldn't be us in the millennium living a thousand years and try to type of baptism of the holy ghost now we have the baptism in the holy ghost do we already have the the if the millennium if jesus had the millennium in him was by the new birth we got a millennium in us you understand what i'm saying that's the thousand years yes we don't have to worry about it we're going to be there it's not whether we're going to make it or not we've already made it it's already in us we just need to wait until this other catches up and that's what's happening if you get what i'm trying to preach to you we we got the new birth we'll get the resurrection more this evening we got the new birth all right but that puts our soul ahead we're having to wait till time catches up we're having to wait here in mortal bodies now waiting for god to fulfill the rest of his word to bring about a rapture and then take us to a married supper and it'll bring us into the millennium what a beautiful time it'll be do you think people don't want to know you remember little brown said the millennium would be to the jews as a nation now so that means there's going to be some jews there we know according to the prophet there's going to be 144 000 there all right what do you think you're going to be doing in the millennium you're going to be learning about him and then going out and telling them about him because they don't know about him like we do right the old testament saying you know the people there even though they'll be there but they won't be the bride that's right you know you don't have that part they rejected that right they'll be there but they won't be the bride of jehovah they'll be the his servants you know you understand what i'm getting at see it is this is something special to you and i yes and we're learning a lot here but what about when we get there i mean you dated for a long time right you thought you knew your boyfriend or girlfriend that's true until reality happened and you got married right then you begin to find out a lot of things he snores you see they do that why is dayton you know if that right sister anderson he snowers so you have to put a bedroom down the hall because of the snowboard but still after all this sweet snoring in there my wife will punch me all the time said turn over your snorer but i can say this with an honest heart 55 years and i never told her to turn over i don't care how loud you know why because that's my wife that's not why it's not just somebody that i've listened to snowboarding just keeps me awake man we go deer hunting we get we're always lined up with some all right so we got that fixed he pulled his camper down there and he said brother dale that's your just got a queen-size bed in there and he said that's your bed right there i'm gonna sleep on you i said no no way because see there's a door that can be closed to that room if it gets too bad and i can close him off and he can snow where all he wants to i'll just go to sleep all right i'm learning a lot you were gonna have a millennial right to learn about him it's not over with you brother said he gave us his message of cheer down to the endless ages and you realize what i'm saying then you'll be able to take it to others that heather and it's going to be there you'll be able to preach the gospel to them but i wish you could understand me and my ways of thinking and i'm sorry that's just me but you know they'll be glad to listen to moses talk about what god meant to him right they'll be glad to listen to joshua tell about crossing the red city that he heard from moses there's no problem with hearing it from somebody else and taking it to him so personal because the god in joshua that was standing there after they got over with the same god was in moses that's right that's right do you understand it's going to be a wonderful time of just learning about him that's the point i want you to understand just learning about your your groom your husband and then after that's over we got a future home to go to what a wonderful time and it won't be ever if paul said ever learning but never coming to the knowledge and the truth who has preached the gospel all right let me just quote a few of these and move on they asked brother brown in the questions and answers 1964. say will the millennial running be 1 000 years or just a count of time okay so count of down would be a thousand universe right you count what's his answer i got that one even this i got that one even this morning it's a thousand years so now if the person that said will a millennium be a thousand years of just time he would say that's around a thousand years but they asked would it be a thousand or just a count of time see the millennium is not a count of time right if the millennium is in jesus christ and if jesus christ is in you the millennium is in you now is it an account of time it's something wonderful okay now he said it's the seventh day god had a sabbath hebrews chapter four god had a sabbath and that seventh day was one thousand years long a top of the millennium atop of the millennium a thousand years then god rested from his work he rested one thousand years not because he's tired but as an example to where it would come up to be that there would be a time that we would somebody's going to live a thousand years but he rested now look at number three paragraph 189 questions and answers real number 1 64 8 23 in the morning service god made the world at 6 000 years and the 7 000 he rested he said a man will never live that time out a year or a day day you eat there of the day you die adam or methuselah was the oldest man that was ever lived in the bible and he was 969 years old and he never lived that thousand years but the man that's going to live through the millennium 1000 years to show that the the penalty has been paid man lives forever the day is finished the time is finished they're in eternity it's going to be proving that the penalty of sin is gone well i don't think i got the new birth well i'm still looking at the penalty of sin whether you're looking at me thinking that way or not i'm still looking at you and i getting older and dilapidated and worn out i'm seeing the effects of sin and what sin has done to us but there's going to be a day that there won't be any penalty to be paid he paid the penalty himself see then you're going to rule and reign and the ruling rain you've got to have somebody to rule over that's right so then you won't be ruling over each other all right and then it wouldn't be right to rule over israel if it was to them as a nation that was promised right when it promised to david then his son would sit on his throne amen that was the promise of the millennial reign because that's where he'll do he'll be the son of david then solomon in the natural was the son of david but he didn't live a thousand years yet he had a utopia time putting together david and solomon and you wind up with a thousand years that they had peace back there from their enemies you know when you finally get over the end of david in his troubles but think about it to show the sin curse is gone look at number four paragraph 177 question answer 62 527 and then at the return of the church and bride the bride and christ you'll walk out upon the righteous into the millennium now you know that some people teach we're going to walk out upon our own ashes that's a doctrine in this message you say well brother dale wolf all i try to do is warn you because you may listen to so and so and then preaching so beautiful and you think boy that's right we're going to walk out upon the ashes or we're going to walk on our own axes we're going to walk out upon the ashes of them that burns up but it won't be ours well i'm going to drop mine no if you're going to raise it up you've got a problem then you better make the ass as you're living in eternal right then you won't be walking out on your own ashes all right walk out upon their ashes in the millennium where the earth is purified by fire and they then and theirs they shall reign and the heathen that's never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time now that was one of the things no theologian ever picked on none of that up or nothing your prophet brought it out and the sons of god will be manifested if he's the rain he's got to have something to reign over he's got a domain and they ruled and rang with christ and christ ruled with the wrought of iron the nation then the gospel then the manifested sons of god with the authority just like he had when he was here there will come the millennium in that reign the upon the ashes because that fulfills of malachi 4 when the son of righteous rochester's writing even in his wings and coming forth you know and i want to fulfill malachi 4. but he understands what i'm saying the heather is going to be raised up so who's going to live a thousand years and he's going to live a thousand years yes because the prophet never said they'd be raised up eternal or whatever they are and i don't understand it so don't ask me are they eternal i don't know i just know the prophet said the healing would be raised that's right all right so that solves the problem he explains how that those things are about because of of paul talking in the scriptures you know it'll hit me in a second but he's talking about being judged one of another and right around said a lot of those here and lived according to their tribes or perfect life better than ours that's right what are you doing just throw them into hell for because you didn't take the gospel to him right come on i'm glad he's going to give the heathen an opportunity to be able to hear the gospel you know it's going to deliver to we are going to be a lot of people in the millennium if you get down to thinking about it you've got your israel as a nation you got 144 000 you got all your fist sealed you where are you going to put them show me where to go to the bathroom i want it in the bible and i want the prophet's message you can't put those at the white throne all right i ain't gonna be able to get down to what i want to get on it but just think they've never heard the gospel so they'll hear the gospel so you're gonna rule and rain not ruling rain like a rod of iron as we were reading like water just covering them it won't be no problem right there won't be no devil he's going to be busy he's going to be in the bottomless pit but he's trying to dig himself that's right you know why the hell's not eternal because he called the bottomless pit see and that there ain't no bottom to it so if hell can't be currently just keeps falling you can't break up those signs but now watch the prophet said i believe in the millennial running the physical return of the lord jesus that's invisible union paragraph 34. to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood all right we'll reign with him for a thousand years right jump on over then to number eight brother anderson let's see where the chill back turns so they're swapping out a little bit today well look what happens now to satan you say well how can you have a thousand years of perfect peace you can't unless you do something with the devil i mean you've got to deal with it because he's the guy that's caused all his problems and he ain't going on vacation you know he's gonna have to be dealt with him so god tells you how he's dealt with revelation 23 and cast him into the bottomless pit and him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more to the thousand years before phil and after that he must be loosed a little season now cast him into a bottomless pit looks like a chain look like some kind of doing but let's get this let's get these go ahead number nine let me get these five this is the junction of time 1956 11 15 or e7 it's 79 we know that we're in the great day of the life's reign when satan will be bound and cast into the pit chained with a chain of circumstances not a log chain you can't hold satan with a log chain you can't shut him up in a building and lock a door right you just go through the wall because you don't have any spirit all right so it's chained with a chain of circumstance what that he cannot come out and deceive the nations no more he won't have anybody he can deal with you certainly ought to think that the bride of jesus christ he won't be able to deal with us because we're supposed to cast satan out now right he's supposed to be out of our soul where god's not living there he's supposed to be cast out if we can't cast him out now then there won't be no chain of circumstances to hold him right he cannot come out and deceive the nations no more a thousand-year millennial reign will take place on the earth while we're glorifying our lord jesus and adorn him crowding him the king of kings and lord of lords going for the next this is where he says not a log chain the living room with christ for a thousand years upon the earth and on the count of the time the parable this comes to the sabbath not because his subjects is all in hell the reason satan won't have anybody to deal with in the millennium all his subjects is busy somewhere else you know that brother branham even explains i didn't bring it but he says why is he loose for a little season he says together all of his subjects bringing them to the white throne judgment but he don't know that he can't raise the dead now i didn't say that okay but when god raises the dead satan will be right there thinking man he's in control again but he's only leading him to the white trunk if we get time we'll find out he don't even get to make it okay we get kind of see his subjects is all the people satan's bound he can't work he has nothing he can do he's helpless and hopeless just waiting for the resurrection of the subjects not a chain of circumstance i'm not a chain to hold him not a building to put him in a pit to drop him in it this means that he is taking away any ability that he has to work through mine that's why you're going to have a utopia a thousand years without saying he's going to be tied up right he's going to be number 12 brother anderson revelation 20 you find the very interesting scriptures and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are under four quarters of the earth looks like some kind of a uh doing but he's really bringing his subject to the resurrection i mean he's actually getting them after the resurrection because they're going about to be raised up huh you say well there could be some people on earth leaving that's up to you whatever you want to do because it will come to gog and magog which will be a final termination and gog and magog will be destroying demons and everything right not just uh doing they went up on the red sea then was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever what about satan the author and the instigator of hell winds up going there or the lake of fire which we'll get to in a second he goes there but the devil is cast in after the millennial reign because he lives for a little season but look at the next scripture coming up to the next one look at number 13. you remember the other day when i brought this out revelation 19 20 once and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles within which we he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and then that worshipped his image these both were cast into the lake of fire burning with brimstone that's very interesting to me because according to my understanding from the prophet and the bible that every man has to be judged first before he can be cast into the lake of fire that was not the lack of fire death and hell were reading the minutes cast into the microphone like a fire is a final annihilation can be for thousands and thousands of years but it'll finally become extinct but now listen how come these can be cast in and how come satan can be cast in and after the thousand years has expired he'll be cast into the lake of fire you don't have no record that satan has to go to judgment i got one quote from brother around he said satan's got to be judged i agree with him because he's judged himself now the reason it says the beast and the false prophet that's not referring to just literally man because the beast is satan rome which is many people which is a spirit the false prophet is a spirit not necessarily a physical being because there's many many many false prophets right and see the demons can be cast in without having to be judged you say let me make god no you don't understand every man that ever lives on the earth has to be judged you ain't listening what i'm saying if it's a man who's got to be judged satan is not no man that's right he's an angel a created being he's not a human being body soul spirit so then your beast and your false prophet is cast in even before the millennium comes then after the millennium is over satan's cast in and will be annihilated because brother said that will be annihilation over demons and everything no time you come to the future home there's not going to be anything but i hope you understand what i'm saying every person has to be judged but angels are not people they will be judged yes but they don't you know satan and him won't have a chance to stand to watch on judgment deplete the case that's the point i want you to see he won't have a chance to plead his case those that white throne will have a chance to plead your case right but you better believe we don't want to stand there because what would be cleaning your case you remember the the man that brought around was talking about city that he stood there you know and he said they wouldn't nobody's going to represent him but said jesus stepped up well that man wouldn't have wiped on judgment doing that he was talking about other things but he said he stepped up and said put it on me foolish virgins it'll be put on him at the white throne we'll get to that but satan's not a man he don't have to be judged you don't have to be lenient on him i'm sorry for him i really am because he can't be saved he made his choice a long time ago and he's judged when he made that choice the beast is the symbolics the false prophet is a symbolics because it would take millions of people to be the false prophet right but it's just symbolics he's showing you a judgment is cast on them now because revelations 20 and 14 says death and hell was cast into the lake of fire this is the second death this is the second death all right see the second death is what we don't want to go to he said he's captain to hell his second death you're okay you know but just being technical it won't work because death and hell is both cast into the lake of fire the lake of fire is the second death that's why the soul will die that's not born again the soul that doesn't have eternal life right even if you go to the white throne and receive it as a foolish virgin you will have eternal life and the soul that senate that shall die for the second death that's why the bible says don't fear him that can destroy the body that's right right but fear him that can destroy body and soul is that scripture see because they're going to be annihilation he said well that's a horrible thing to think about all of the billions and billions and billions of people that think that we'll have to burn in hell maybe for a million years 10 million century but they won't burn there eternally because we don't believe in the eternal hell i know we've been talked that down to there but there's no scripture for it that's where our teaching is wrong show it to me you would have to have eternal life to be able to burn in hell eternally is that sensible amen you would have to have eternal life all right and then you would have god's own life because he's the only one eternal and that'd be putting god in hell that's right see that's what they never thought about the preacher a preacher in hell like a good old baptist he likes to fry you over hell like a weenie so he likes to scare you you take away his doctrinal point of that and he's lost because he likes to get to the end of the sermon and scare you if you don't get saved you're going to die and go to hell eternally no the bible speaks of eternal judgment true because once you're judged you're judged that's what i said about satan he's already judged that's right he's judging been cast into the lake of fire the beast in the false prophet is cast in there without having to go to a white throne because they're already judged and you're not dealing with human morals you're dealing with demons demons don't have a right of any form of correction or straightening up you'll just be burnt up one day but you say well that's horrible to think about an eternal i mean a hell that would be from millions of years never one day it'll be extinct because if you put him in hell eternally you've got god going to hell solve the problem or be sensible enough to think about you'd have to have god's own life because god's the only one that's eternal and if you have an eternal hell you'd have to have god's own life living in hell then you'd have god going to hell that wouldn't work well he went what he did he went one time but he sure didn't stay he kicked satan over into the bed and come on back up right right you see what i'm talking about little simple poet little dogs to tie together look at the lights quote this is taken from the sumerian church age which is church a book page 133 and we all know that the second death is the lake of fire revelation 2014 and death and hell were kept to do elect for this is the second day and of course that means all those who with our end were cast into the lake of fire and they don't want to bring out something here for you and that's what he brings out that you cannot have eternal hell if you did you'd have god living in hell but think about it what a wonderful thing it is to think about this if we have eternal life by the new birth then we have the millennium inside of us we don't have to worry about the judgments and the things we already have eternal life the millennium is not to just say the reason it says a thousand years is to just prove the sin curse you'll come the brother in this message said that that's really not millennium there and it's millennial which would mean thousands well i don't know that's none of my business i just know one thing for certain i'm not concerned about it because it's not me that's going to be living a thousand years it's the heathen going to be living a thousand years and what happens to him i don't know so don't ask me say well what are they going are they going to be saved well the gospel is going to be preached to him so the gospel is preached to him and let's be an opportunity because why would you preach to them if there's not you know there's no need to preach it to them it's all right that's fine i don't know i don't mind telling you when i don't know i don't know because i can't find where the prophet said but i thank god for the truth to be able to show me that there's going to be a millennial ring one day we're going to have a million years i can preach a sermon then i'll probably get done i wouldn't have 89 sermons already on the book of revelation i can have a thousand years or something to preach because see it's not going to be just a it's not going to be a preaching services if you understand what i mean your sister is going to have your chance the brothers you're going to have your child so there's going to be no kids there but in the bride right because we're going to be the same age but you'll be able to talk to people yes but it won't be see this is the one thing i like the garden of eden was a millennial right now are you listening for a second beautiful utopia everything perfect it wasn't hot it wasn't cold it wouldn't everything everything was just perfect but then satan come along there were no crooked trees there was no worked up fruits with no naughty apples nothing but everything was perfect the satan come along and he began to pervert but see one day there's going to be a millennium it ain't going to be no shape you don't have to walk around is he going to come out of the bushes and deceive me no he won't be nowhere around you don't have to worry about him when he's loose for a little season they asked brother brown said where would the bride be when some of those things he said she'll be on the outer rims of the earth now you explain that i don't know see because satan ain't going to be able to deceive us he can't do it now if you're a born-again christian he can hinder you give you problems but he cannot deceive you that's a wonderful time i'm already enjoying it that way if you preach the millennium as beginning in the millennium the day you got born again i wouldn't argue too much with anybody about it but i'd just say it still ain't no millennium around here now it ain't been for 2000 years so that's just going too far but i think we're having order wonder church we know what's going to take place there we go here what's going to take place there he said well just a million little cabin right around i said you'll hear me over there he goes to the future home with it because he didn't care a little log cabin he didn't hear he was offered all kind of money we were listening to him last night all kind of money you know that he could have had but he didn't want none he said what does it matter whether you have money or whether you have a nice home or just a home he said what does it matter it's as long as you got jesus christ you remember the old hate jamala story he said i've been in king's palace and you know he prayed for king jordan he said i've been in king's house he said but never was i'm more welcome when i walked into iran a lot of difference but you see church we're gonna go to a millennial run for a thousand years and that's gonna prove that the sin curse is totally acknowledged well from there on there's not no opportunities once satan is thrown into the lake of fire that's his second death he's not seen anymore after the lake of fire because you get into 21 and 22 and you'll get into the future home right satan won't be nowhere around won't be no trouble that's what the resurrection means to me come on let's sing this song think on these things think on the fact that the resurrection made a way that you and i could live and have peace while we're here there never will be peace on earth until the millennium right may be peace in your heart but the world will never have peace but in the millennium it'll be perfect peace see i don't think you're going to be standing around looking at this clock and say when did you say that other day's going to end because that's what i'm saying that we can just go anywhere do anything we want to then it don't make no difference oh we're the bride cry but you know what they're doing now they're teaching in the message people some aren't doing this now that we're already into the millennium and the reason they're saying that is they're saying that we're in the millennium so we're under another covenant you heard that you've heard that we're under another covenant now since the seals broke and the prophet's message come and the lady will see an age ended they said it ended in 77 and it ended and when it did said we're under another covenant so now you women can cut your hair or wear your pants paint your face marry a dozen times don't make no difference because we're under another covenant sounds like satan's not bound yet right sounds like he's still working right go ahead 299 anybody have any 299 is a sparrow book my brother's having trouble with the blank you know that we've got blood clots they say but yet we believe we believe in a millennial we believe in a time now that we can rejoice and believe but by strike we're here in the name of jesus christ we lay our hands upon our brothers believing that by your stripes now just come and give energy back to the body all of these things that satan has taken said you in jesus name coming let's play yes uh down hear them is i'm is amen you will never ever i
