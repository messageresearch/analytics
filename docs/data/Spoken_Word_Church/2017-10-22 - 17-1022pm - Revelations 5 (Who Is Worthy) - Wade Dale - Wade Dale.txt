you supposed to be my brother home alone gora told us he said you need when somebody comes to see you you say make yourself at home where you ought to be you can take that to different ways so good to be in the house of the Lord let me read you a little something that we got in the email it tells you how far reaching that that the ministry is here and and that people are being blessed around the world this comes from a brother in Western Australia says dear brother Samuel I have been listening to your sermons for some time now so I just wanted to write and say how much I appreciate your ministry most pastors preach encouraging sermons but I find that your depth of understanding of the message and your teaching has greatly helped me I've been following the message for many years and I am now an old man living alone in a retirement village in Perth Western Australia it is not easy for me to go to church so listening to your sermons and also brother Wade's is a wonderful blessing I will never meet you on this side but you've touched my life and I just want to say thank you God bless you yours in Christ brother Kenneth gone from Australia so there'll be a lot of people when we all get together over there there'll be a lot of people said we really enjoyed what you had to say and you never meet them in your entire life same way on your walk in life it's not just here folks this ice you you're walking life your job and and many things that you do you you affect people the reason we're here is for our purpose and it's not just to have our own little caulk and you know ever knowwwww supposed to give it to the world you supposed to let your light shine everywhere you go so good to be in the house of lore but yeah I thought that was kind of good I mean way over in Australia only Donnie's been to Australia I mean it's a long way from here but but thank goodness this brother at the end of his life coming into a retirement village and can't get out hey ain't nothing wrong with that listening to the Word of God and getting something any blessing their soul there's a lot of things we listen to bless our soul but but coming from a true believer I believe it's it's worthy so let's turn to Revelation chapter 5 we'll get started now on Revelation chapter 5 and today we want to talk about who is worthy because we see we come up and I'm going to take the chart one more time and just kind of give us some an update of of where we're at in the message as far as coming out of the church ages because remember the message the message is eternal so and you do have to place it in different in different spots but you got to remember that Jesus Christ was slain 2,000 years ago but he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that in God's mind that all this is finished but we had to come down here into reality and go through it right and I was like I was thinking the other day you know brother Dale was talking about we would really we would just be we'd be almost zombies because a zombie has nothing inside of them we'd we were really when we were if we just came there the plan that we thought we would be nothing more than just we'd say yes sir and we would be robots and there would be no Bible there would be no overcoming there would be no redemption there would be no revelation there would not be anything it would just be a void there that we would fill and I don't think God God's not that way so he didn't want us to be that way and then so the full revelation of God is this is the way God knew that we would love him the most is to put it in this way right here if not he would have changed then he changed his mind his original plan was this and we're living it I told you many times before and you'll get this one day is this what God thought of or is this his fault cause if he thought of something then it went maybe thirty Seconds to go because remember God's not even in one second he's not one second older than when he thought it before the foundation of the world amen so is this the thought of God back then and then now we've come to time travel or is this the thought of God just being made known just rolling through we drop down I was thinking about this morning we drop down into time that thread of eternity never move you can't move eternal but you can move us we come down in the time but we're going and then that eternal we just connect right back to it and take off again so so good to be in the house of the Lord we're gonna start here revelations 5 and we're we're like we said in the chart we're we're in between that we're in the breach all right so we got to get this thing right the first time and I think that's what brother Branham was he brought that breach at the correct moment to bring us to the and I when you say real revelation that didn't mean that they got a wrong revelation it's just that their revelation was partial I mean all the church ages revelation was partial but I'm promising you Martin Luther even in his partial that little drinking beer and smoking the pipe and and talking about the Word of God that was for his time but if he was to sit here today and listen to a few sermons all that would go away and he wouldn't understand and you know he would probably run anyhow where we fall asleep because hit what it would quickened the part that he didn't have it would quicken that part and he would come right over and just say well that's what that said that's what that said that's what that said but that's the way you and I gotta be though cuz we got to move up we got to remember the thoughts of God is he turning we entered the thoughts of God then we've got to come into that eternal thought we'll see that in just a little while but remember before we read the scripture next Saturday will be the it's not in no Decemberists its next Saturday Saturday we're going to have our Fall Festival we've got it kind of all set up for the kids and the grown-ups we're not gonna have a dunking booth so don't worry about it I just thought I'd scare you but we're gonna have one in April because it'll be warm then not afraid we'd all get sick if we had one this this weekend so we won't have that but we will have hot dogs and chili can't do anything without chili and it's gonna be chilly so bring jackets we're gonna have a little fire but just make sure you bring your jackets with you and also remember the next Saturday November the 4th I'll be at brother Tim hems at 7 o'clock on Saturday evening to have service there and then we're gonna stay over and being serviced with them on Sunday so just keep us in your prayers and know some of you were gonna go then the next Saturday November the 11th is Jim's mother's memorial service at Center Baptist Church she has the obituaries you can run your copy off from there or if you have the Atlanta journal-constitution you can just get it out of it but her obit is in the in the AJC today so you can get that and it is at Center Baptist Church and I think technically it's Roberts town I think it says Helen but I think it's Roberts towns where you'll put your address in so just keep those in your prayer as we follow through so let's go to the Lord and pray Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you just be with us today father you be the one who does the speaking let us hear from you today Lord as as we look through and see these eternal words that are written on the page or may they come alive in our heart may each one of us realized what we're doing here where we come from what we're doing here and where we're going Lord that way we know that you're our guide and you're the one that's going to take us to that position we're looking forward to the many days ahead Lord until your coming that we will grow more in you that the that the bride of Jesus Christ will be as you said in revelations 19 will be a a wife not just a bride will be a wife because we've made ourselves ready we pray Lord that you distinct to find Lord for this journey be with the ones that are not here the ones are on the highways be with the missionaries father give them Lord give them bountiful fruit for their labor Lord we pray that you just take care of us here in this building be with us now and the further man their service in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen revelations five who is worthy and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with her loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth and I was looking for a man no man in heaven nor an earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I'll be held in law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts now who are the four beasts lion ox man and Eagle that's the Holy Ghost amen and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps go and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and have two redeemed us till they made it personal to God by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and we finally get to this maybe later on in a few sermons and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on this earth now if you look in your Scofield Bible the original says we shall reign over the earth a man you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading the word you shall what reign over the earth because remember sorry I ain't got Thomas you remain over the aren't you and I are go to what if Adam I'm way down here I can't stand how much shoes not tied and I usually double knot him but not today but remember I was looking the other day we were talking about something and then the word overcome now we're gonna talk about who is worthy but now remember the reason he was worthy is he overcame something a man think about he overcame something who did Christ remember he got an inheritance remember will read it in a couple of Sundays from now he got an inheritance he inherited eternal wife in his body right he didn't have he didn't need eternal life in his soul My heavens he was he turn alive he didn't just have it he was it a man it's not that Christ is like Bob was telling us in Sunday school this morning you know that that baby that was in that cradle that was gone all mighty no more no less but he was God Almighty in human flesh given what the ability to breathe air down here and to live on earth and become what our kinsmen and that's what we're going to talk about today is who is worthy because whoever's worthy had to be if we fail that made us what unworthy we are on worthy but now we got to remember that little brother how you doing come on in sit down brother Raphael is with us today good to see you buddy all right so now we're this is where we're at for our study everybody knows what that is the candlesticks we're here this is the breach where the Prophet talks about revelations 5 we okay with that say man all right because we know this is what revelation 6 now also you got to remember revelations fathers the breaking of the seals right show you what you're doing is you're gonna lap back and what is this this is telling us that it's broke he was worthy to open the book this is telling us how it happened got it all right this is telling us how it happened in revelation 6 called you're gonna have to lap back and forth because revelations 5 is a scene that John was what he saw the church ages and man revelations 1 through 3 he was caught up in 4:1 now you got to remember to an eye I wanted to hit on this but I kind of kind of didn't because the prophet of God said revelation 4:1 the bride goes up and she's not seen until revelations 19 is everybody alright with that we should be taught well enough to know that this is all scenes that happen and it has all for Israel we're not physically you got it physically here you said what about the coating of the seal I thought we had to be in a higher realm where what we are eternal creatures now that we're born again we're eternal creatures trapped in time and then we're trapped in time but this right here because remember time is no longer when we get to revelations 10 we come to that place where there's no time but we're getting ahead of ourselves so let's drop back to revelations chapter 5 and I saw in the hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within on the backside sealed with seven seals now as we've told you before and for those of you that weren't here that we understand one thing's for sure that the Old Testament Bible and the scrolls were written not in a book but it was written like this if you wanted to read Isaiah the prophet of God said you had to what unroll that part of I left alright so now so then then obviously this is not the seal the seal is what had it hid the seal is what had it closed where you couldn't see what was inside all right so the revelation of the seals broke the seal off and then and then you could read what was inside that all rights Amen all right that's exactly what we're looking at too though even in Revelations 5 we see that somebody was worthy to take this and pull the seal back because no man was worthy to do it william branham was not worthy to do it john the baptist was not worthy to do it paul was not worthy to do it yet they're a part of it you can't kick them out they're a part of it because they broke while the Prophet was here through the Prophet Christ broke the seals and then cause remember as we as we showed you before and I'm getting a little ahead of myself but I think I want to all right so look you got in the Old Testament you got seven church ages right we talked about that the other day but for those of you that weren't here there's seven church ages in the Old Testament brother Branham said the middle age is just like our middle age was when what church and state combined church and state combined when they having Jezebel married so you kind of got your center point but we know one thing for sure the last church age of the Old Testament Elijah came on the scene John the Baptist because in the last church age of the Gentiles who came on the scene the Elijah William Branham the messenger comes at the end of the age John came at the end of the age what six months the prophet of God said walk the Laodicean age would be a a short age so John had a short age but now who did he introduce he introduced the head Christ the literal man I mean the flesh man John introduced the flesh man Christ the Son of man on the earth behold the lamb of God it takes away the sin of the Orcas into the world now what this allowed you do same thing but now what happened between here and here Christ II more feed from what of corporal body come on somebody he come he more and more feed from a corporal body because that corporal body went up cuz we're gonna talk about Thrones here in a minute that corporal body went up and it's sitting but what to do he sent the Holy Ghost down to m-more feet into a bride he morphing into a bride sure he had bride all these church ages is his body we know that but right at the end the head had to come that's what we're looking to revelations file because when we get to the end of this service I want you to see that he says who is worthy and what's the first thing you think of Christ Jesus Christ not Christ Jesus Christ amen cuz it was a man sure Christ is a man but Christ is all the way back from the beginning but he wasn't a flesh man kinsman redeemer man until he came right here amen at the end of the church age of the Old Testament that's why I remember the teto the New Testament didn't start till the book of I Matthew Mark Luke and John is a commentary of what happened while the Son of Man was here but you come at the end John come at the end of that age I love this and introduced Christ and Christ preached three and a half years Elijah in the end time introduced Christ in the breach introduced class and then he preached for three and a half years brought the headstone back to the church not back to the person Christ I said the person Jesus Christ we will not see him until the Millenium in the way that we want to see it is that right remember we meet him in the air sure we go to a wedding supper we go eat and we have a rejoicing time but I want you to see something when he said in Revelations who will read it in a minute he said you'll sit in my throat as I have set in my father stroke you're gonna sit in my throne now the Father's throne is in heaven the son of man's throne is on this earth this is when we set our foot back on this earth in the Millennium will God Almighty in human flesh he'll be the son of David that's one we're gonna see in a few minutes the reason he's worthy we know that he was virgin born son of God we know that but he had to go through stages because remember he was the son of God - the son of man - the son of David Amen because there's promises in the Bible for each one of them alright where do you say sterling a man well Moses said what he'll they'll raise up a prophet locking to me right so we had all the promises then David David said Michael the your throne will be forever son of David gonna be wise there's the Millennium alright so let's just start here and see because in Revelations 5 look I'm not saying these people in the church ages weren't worthy they were worthy for their part but there's only one man that was ever worthy and that's Christ Jesus not Christ Christ is that Genesis 1:26 men that never fell Jesus never fell but he came in to our fallen whatever you wanna call it dimension whatever he didn't fall he came into this fallen condition but remember his the effect on him was that he got older remember him Satan would have left him alone this is profound if Satan would have left Jesus alone he too died an old man and we'd still have a problem but same put him on cross and you and I were inside of it and then on the day of Pentecost here we come 120 little jesus's then 3,000 little Jesus now Satan's got millions of little Jesus he's one that he's kind of like that guy that he tries to kill one and thirty comes out and kills another in 30 cars tell me this morning when Bob was preaching them or teaching on the corn of wheat you know you take one corn of wheat put it in the ground when it comes out at least has two ears on the stock ears of corn that has six to eight hundred seeds on each one take those and dry them out and put them in the ground you see how the seed but because of one seed Christ Jesus Christ not Christ Jesus Christ one in the ground you can't put Christ in the ground but Jesus Christ went in the ground one see now what a hundred and twenty seeds came up then three thousand seeds came up and as a word went forth millions of seed there'll be millions of people because of that one corn of wheat that went in the ground hey ma'am now let's read quote number one everybody all right with that so we got the stage set we we got excuse me we've got the church ages in order I believe don't you think we're just worried about our Gentile AIDS now I believe that there was a church age in the Old Testament because I can see it the prophet of God said it was so we see that Christ came at the end of the age same thing was here Christ is coming what comes at the end of the age our agenda or I'm sorry Elijah to introduce Christ and and I I'm gonna say this with with all respect but there's no way brother branham could have been here for what we're in now I must decrease he must increase Christ ain't gonna share his glory with nobody and I don't want him to you know because we'd be looking at two we need to be looking at what amen we know brother Brennan what did it he introduced us to Christ he wasn't Christ he introduced us to cry but now we can look back and see where Christ came from he came what through that man remember the mighty angel came down and brought a message to open the seals to read bring us to full Redemption we'll see that in just a minute because look when I say who is worthy the first thing you say is you saw it was Jesus Christ sure but remember he's the first fruit he's that first seed that went in the ground and because he went in the ground and what got a body change he said where I am you will be also she is him my people the breech look at number 1 notice he is not an animal he took the book out of the right hand and him set up on the throne who was it the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand no angel no angelic being nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what is it brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture I that not an angel not nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that set up on the throne what is it now it belongs to the lamb yeah man alright let's go to the number two or three and then we'll then we'll get started these I've already read before but now look at number two the breech no we're look still in the breeze now remember because we haven't gotten to the opening of the seals yet but we have to him be in position remember we talked about the breech the breech birth week we can't come feet first we got to come head first and man so we got to come head first go that's the head all right so the breech the property guard is is showing us how listen God doesn't ever have to explain himself but he does right he doesn't have to explain who he is but he he has to though for you and I and our finite condition can understand an infinite God so he what he comes down to not make yourself smaller he comes down to make yourself bigger through his people through you and eyelet that's what a brother down one stomach this morning Adam had a long and gone head along you to talk to Adam well Adam was in God the Creator standing here they alo him let us make man in our own image now where did that man come from he in creating remember oh yeah you say well it created well we've already been through that you know that that word create means form there's no way that you and I in that Genesis 1:26 have a beginning you hear me that Genesis 1:26 man never had a beginning or it's gonna have an end I rest my soul at that thing right there Genesis 1:26 man never had a beginning cuz if I can connect to that then I'll never have an end amen that all right now Genesis 1:26 man is very important that is Christ but when God stand ándale him standing here by self he brings somebody into being and it's in a multiple form and it's his all of his bride down through the church ages I was thinking why brother Dale was preaching this morning we actually as believers even in this message are tunas crash enough cry enough brother Brown said if you see two ones got to be God and the other ones got to be the what die Diablo hey man mucho Caliente hi the devil when we start realizing that Christ came here to tell us we were one not two but we all like just like I said who is worthy first thing we said well I know were they you're not in the condition that you're thinking Urena amen but he's worthy and if he's worthy and I was in him that makes me worthy cuz I trust him I don't trust me I trust him all right look the breach that's what the Holy Spirit's been doing he goes he inspects that's the reason you can't have these things you have spoken tongues I shouted I danced in the spirit I don't have nothing to do with it Holy Spirit inspects that person until he's thoroughly satisfied and knows that they are then they are sealed unto their eternal destination there's not nothing can ever break that seal the Bible you're putting scripture down visions for 36 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption now we're talking about Redemption we look hold that word Redemption until the day that the book of Redemption has been revealed made known seal has been broke the rider rides home but there's something left for me and you this is what we're doing this has been already exposed the wild horse riders the Antichrist but but no one he's the anti-crisis not gonna change your body knowing what was written underneath that seals what's gonna change your body and man cuz look keep weird Empson Redemption Redemption we're going to become about Redemption Redemption Redemption book of redemption the breach is where the redemption comes in sure the devil has to be exposed because he's riding down through these search ages spitting out his doctrine but there had to come a time that what we need to me to me when he was exposed he was dead cuz in Revelations 5 show me look in your Bible show me one place the devil's in there everybody's gonna show me you were reading again he's not in there now he's in revelation 6 because that's showing you how what that man picked that book up the books menu hold that word redemption until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the Redeemer comes to claim his possession nothing can do it don't grieve it do the things that please God for the book is sealed now and you are sealed and then excuse me now number 3 revelation chapter 5 verse 1 chapter 5 1 let's just read the red part look this is not written in the word it's sealed in the back of the book back of the word the book was sealed by these seven seals let me hold them rain the whole mystery of the book is sealed up in those seven seals this is one of the most greatest chapters in the whole book of Revelation why because if we don't get this right if we don't get them if we don't get the birth right if we don't get the head right we're not going to understand revelation 6 7 8 and obviously we're not going to get to 19 cuz in 19 look we're ready we're ready to go the wife has made herself ready not in the process of making ready but ready standing there's one day we're gonna stand ready for whatever God brings this is one of the most greatest chapters in the whole book of Revelation and I saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within inside written that's what we're reading this morning the backside sealed with seven seals outside the Bible what the Bible doesn't even say now listen what does the Bible not say the Bible never says in the book that Wade Dale owned December the 17th 1997 he's going to come to a realization that he's lost you can't find that in the book but it's written from Genesis 1:26 all the way to revelations 19 I'm in the whole book you're in the whole book it's not written anywhere where brother Raphael one day comes to God and he does this and he is this and he does this but everything in that book typed you and I never want to preach that sermon when that literal literal is not a type I mean I'm a literally way Dale I'm that person I'm not a type of me I am that person if you're ever going to be mrs. Jesus Christ you have to realize you not a second person that's our problem Adam and Eve literally was one person now you and I because of the fall take me that way June and I are one as one can be but they can take her DNA and my DNA and they're different but if Adam and Eve went to the doctor and the doctor took a sample of her blood in a sample of his blood and he's in confound he couldn't found the scientist you can't do that well in God you can cuz the Bible says will have a body laughing to his glorious body boy it makes me feel good he's gonna change me even in the atoms he's gonna change my DNA not that I would different but I don't know where it came from and you know what we're not gonna do that that to me that's why the Prophet came brother Ram came to show us it's all gonna happen right here all other denominations everybody in the world believes we got to go somewhere to get all this when we get to heaven we're gonna I thought the mighty angel came down I thought Redemption happens on earth Redemption doesn't happen in heaven Redemption happens here if you're in heaven you're already redeemed that's why that the people are waiting in that other dimension to get back here they're waiting to come back here the only reason they're not here cuz we have not conquered death yet why would you want to come from a place that's so sublime there's a to eternal life back into this thing but one day one day somebody is gonna stand here and that's gonna crawl up your arm you're gonna say you have no hold on me I am worthy because of that man and then they're gonna come from that dimension and step right over into this way get their flesh body and we're gonna step over into another one and wait till this thing's burn off those people in that Curt across that curtain of time they told William Brennan if you had no car sure they know Jesus Christ saved their soul amen but they said William Branham if you hadn't come if you hadn't come you're the one that planted the seed remember Paul Barnabas and all the one watered one planet one gets God gets increase right Paul planted Barnabas watered washing of the water of the word but who gets increase God's the one that's on the one who's worthy we know that but we're gonna have to see though that we're not Adam and Eve weren't two separate people they were one person a man they were literally boned of their bone in flex with their flesh and if the first Adam and Eve did that then guess why you're not going to be the same boy ain't even close to getting started that all right everybody sorry didn't mean to holler oh yeah I did let's go to number let's go to number four he's getting happy when you see something you know I just get happy when a season and the strong angel with a loud voice proclaim who is worthy who is able to do this then the elder says don't wait for the Lion of the tribe of Judah he is worthy and he has overcome now we're going to talk a little bit later about overcoming because remember you got to overcome there's got to be something like brother dev summit it there was not being overcoming if we just come the first way what would we have overcome nothing but here now we've got testimonies that were we're going to talk about free eternity what God did for us then the elders who don't wait for the line of tribe of Judah he is worthy and here is overcoming and he took the book and opened the book and loosed the seals thereof he never told what happened to them when we hit them seven seals being opened right down through the Bible what's what took place right in this seven sealed book that were in that we're we're entered now holds the whole mystery of all what the redemption blessings of God so when these seals open you and I are supposed to see the redemptive blessings of God not just that the white horse rider was the Antichrist then he had a bow in the house and he was a bluff sure that's what we're supposed to see it first but there's something underneath that it's got to be redemption who is worthy let's go to number five the breach now I and a strong angel now verse 2 the strong angel with a loud voice proclaiming who is worthy worthy for what who is worthy to take that book now we find out where's the book at now to its original owner because it had been forfeited by a son the first son of God in the human race which was who items what brother Dells preaching on now and when he forfeited his right to listen to Satan see that's what we blow Eve up about all this we know the act came through but what's what did he do he accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's work so he was the son of God the Bible says he was the son of God the Prophet said he was the son of God but the book then what happened then Adam had the ability to do whatever he wanted to on the earth multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion he had all these characteristics that he had to fulfill but he couldn't do it once he crossed the chasm you know you can say what you want to about what Adam did with Eve but there's one thing for sure Adam thought he could save Eve but he couldn't there's only one Savior that's what we're talking about here there's only one man worthy Adam wasn't worthy he thought maybe he could be but brother Rob said when he got out when he went out with Eve there's no way he could get back cuz he was not he was not the creator he was not the Redeemer he was not the healer Adam had a place you and I have a play everybody's got a place but and so does God God's place is he's everything but Adam got out and couldn't get back he lost the ability look watch who was the original owner to its original the original owner was Elohim the creator is the one that developed this book called Genesis 1:26 and he handed part of it to Adam and through Adam and Eve he was going to produce the rest of it amen but Satan got involved he forfeited his right to listen to Satan he give up what did he do he accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's Word so that's why that then God said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman a division enmity alright a division that's our problem the carnal mind it's kind of strange that we were born with a carnal mind and basically we still got one I mean we have the mind of Christ and we're supposed to have you know but sometimes we like like Bob said this morning we've the flus get stopped up and we can't get all that out all right you know but we're supposed to have the mind of Christ right but that's what we're doing we're getting all these flus through all this through all these hours and fifty and sixty years after the Prophet we're getting the flu clean down the chimney sweep the Holy Ghost is coming up there nice taking this take it what he's taking the flus and he's cleaning them out so that's what happened Adam his flus got stopped down but the original owner was God Almighty Himself hey man he owns everything amen but he was going to give part of it to Adam and then he give out he give Eve to Adam to reproduce itself not sexually not to the loins of man any more loins it's down here now it's up here the spoken word is the original seed speak the word and it'll happen he even told Moses and Moses why are you crying speak same way with you and I but he lost the ability to produce the book Adam Adam lost that ability to produce the book and who is the book I got a list here I was listening to just few minutes ago there's the book the book consists of Christ and his bride foolish virgin fifth seal Jew 144,000 cup of water my name the earth the future huh I mean the millennium and the future home that's what consist of this book and it's nothing without the people in it when the city of Gainesville the bottle of Bible sorry the newspaper says the city of Gainesville come out to the parade today well all the buildings didn't hop out in front of them right I'm not gonna do that again that hurt but who came out that people the people came out and walked along that was the city of Gainesville it's not the literal book you and I were the literal book we're not gonna have a book in heaven where we all go when our sister Anna Cunard you're right here no you're gonna say no I'm right here I'm not in the book anymore because the book was taken by the lamb hey man all right I promise you ain't gonna jump I'm telling it again I have lost a little weight but not that much yet but he lost the ability to produce all this Adam did remember the first item failed the second Adam will not fail did not fail that's what we put all of our attention to then in Revelations 5 is that is that even listen in our understanding listen I said in our understanding Christ wasn't fully revealed in the church ages partial partial truth partial truth but then that which is perfect is come that which is in part to be done away with a man there's only one perfect one and that's cross but you and I as the bride if we've made our self ready here what you hear what I'm saying he says the wife has made herself ready but Adam lost the ability to produce the book so God took the book back God's the only one worthy Christ is the only one worth he has the book he has control of it all that's why down through the through the Old Testament you would see him show up but not the book hold on you sho know that I read it to you last Sunday Redemption wasn't in the Old Testament right I'll read it to you next Sunday cuz I'm not gonna bring this Sunday but next Sunday brother Branham said souls in prison he said not in the Old Testament nobody in the Old Testament had this Genesis 1:26 men in their soul they had an anointing just like I know it listen to me I said just like anointing ones that's why the property guard to look back and he said that anointing to come on David he was speaking the first person but when that anointing comes off of David he'd have his best friend killed and commit adultery but God's not looking at that God's looking through what the eyes of the Redeemer but he's not redeemed yet David's not redeemed yet Abraham's not redeemed yet Isaiah's not redeemed yet no sir they without us cannot be made perfect they without us can't come to a place where they see Christ like you and I see cross there's nobody not even to the church ages this terrorize think about this yesterday said understand there's nothing ever unfolded to a group of people like today nothing nothing even Paul pumps that I look through a glass darkly I don't know what's coming but look we've come right here we can look all the way back down through those ages we can see every characteristic of God that's already been made manifest and you and I are standing right here let me ask you a question was any of that hid from Christ was any of that hidden from Christ no he's the one who brought he's the one who brought him you don't you think Christ didn't know what Martin Luther was gonna do when Christ came to Martin Luther and gave him a new birth he knew exactly what Martin Luther was gonna do and you know what he was happy with that but he wasn't fully satisfied he was happy with that but he wasn't fully satisfied that all right now look number six as soon as he's made as he made when this angel this mighty angel cried out who is worthy he was advertising right then he was advertising for a kinsman redeemer and immediately after he said who is worthy to take the book then something then John started weep then what happened he's seen somebody read that for me there stood the book now wait a minute there stood the book there stood the book not this there stood the book there it was but who was worthy well there stood Gabriel of course he was worthy but see he wasn't a man he was an angel there stood Michael he was worthy but he wasn't a man he was an angel so it had to be somebody that became a earthly person like we did and when he seen this Lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world come up and he seemed that he had been slain all the way to the foundation of the world then John what they meant because there it was he saw the whole thing now let's read the next one now look he saw the whole thing now what was look he was he saw a lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world now this is not in there this is not in their notes but I just picked this up revelation 13:8 that kind of ring a bell revelation 13:8 says all would be deceived except those that were written in the book of the life of the Lamb before the foundation of world what is Hebrews 13:8 say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever revelation 13:8 in Hebrews 13:8 the same identical thing amen all right all right say man all right so the Old Testament to John here we come up the old testament of john christ comes on the scene sorry cross died to release the life to come into these people cuz he wasn't in these people in a new birth he didn't reside that okay he didn't reside in these people he would anoint them and then when the anointing would leave Moses he would anoint Moses speaking the first person amen flies fleas and frogs but now when Moses went and killed that Egyptian that was across that was Moses the man a man because what the holy ghost would come on them do what he wanted to do and then he would pull off right because remember even John the the Bible says date that the Holy Ghost told John says who you see the spirit descend and remain because John being a prophet he could see that see that's why John had a problem John had a problem because he could walk into the temple in coccus he'd see the anointing see if John the brother Brian could pick that anointing up so could John the Baptist that was that whole message of a lives of that whole Ministry of Elijah was able to pick up spirits so John the Baptist would pick up a spirit he'd walk close to that temple and he'd see the anointing following caucus and he would prophesy and it'd be true but confers put Jesus on the cross amen so Elijah John the Baptist who you see the spirit descend and remain behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world that anointing came down on Jesus and stayed there didn't make him God Bobby read a quote this morning the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in that baby what was that own bomb you remember okay well if you if you watch it you'll see where brother Branham said the fullness of the Godhead bodily it was lying in a manger another word so what happened on the river Jordan we know that we've all been taught so well hid the anointing first ministry had no ministry until he was thirty years old because no priest could preach until he was thirty years old so the anointing comes on Jesus for her three and a half year ministry and then the Bible says the anointing left him even the Prophet says anointing left him in the garden watch so he could die he couldn't die with that three and a half of your ministry that's why I'm telling you there's nothing holding me in you the Prophet had to decrease so that Christ could increase but they don't say that - Brian go she is him and we get that three and a half year ministry guess what we don't die you'll realize that one of these days number seven the Angels call was the call for a kinsman redeemer to appear God said I have a law a kinsman redeemer can be a substitute where is that kinsman redeemer who's able to take it and it came from Adam all the way down through all the apostles and prophets and everything else and nobody was found now what about that nobody in heaven nobody on earth nobody that ever lived Elisha was standing there we think he might be worthy nope Moses was standing there all the apostles were standing there of all the ones that had died all the holy man job the sages everyone was standing there and nobody was worthy even to look at the book let alone to take it and break the seals because look if you took the book you had to be able to redeem everything in that book that just makes sense to me I mean you can't read that in the Bible anywhere but that just make sense if you're able to take the book you got to be worthy to take it and you got to be able to do something with it when you take it you're not just gonna take the book say well I got the book no you gotta be able to do something with it right that's what he just says take it and break the seals okay all right done all right say man now number that seven number eight now let's take a little bit on Redemption Redemption have you heard that before Redemption before this person could be could redeem the first thing he had to be worthy he had to be the right kind of person person so this was accomplished when Jesus Christ was born a virgin birth for he was good he was God Himself made a man he was God in human flesh he had to be worthy and the virgin blood of Jesus Christ made him worthy now we find that if you want to go to the scripture first Peter 1:18 2:20 if you're keeping the scriptures or keep going he prevailed God took on the form of human flesh he came to the earth was born a little baby and walked among us and through his holy blood he prevailed now let's read let's read what he said to read first Peter 1:18 let's go to first Peter 1:18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things whatever took the book could not be corruptible because what was in the book at one time listen to me at one time was corruptible because Redemption is you went from here to here and back to here right so we had to fall that was a fall in there somewhere because like like Brooke like brother Dale says there's nothing to redeem if you're already perfect there's nothing to redeem but you and I are redeemable because we fail ok we're redeemable because this is what happened down here for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you and watch times 2,000 years in these last times these last two thousand years Christ is what he was foreordained to what manifest himself through seven church ages but he's not finished the heads got to come back revelations 9 I mean sorry revelations 5 this is to quote number 9 and soon as he advertised who is worthy he was advert housing the coming of the kinsman redeemer and here he stood a lamb and what did he do walked over to the throne look now remember this is a scene and to get this scene you have to have some spiritual thinking nearby alright without you got to have some spiritual thinking the second thing you gotta do is wake up hyah hyah he was advertising the coming of a kinsman redeemer and here he stood a lamb what did he do walked over to the throne where the Spirit of God was now in the scene you'd think that's two people but remember God is manifesting self in another form God's one but now you got to remember one thing y'all forget so do I say y'all I say y'all everybody don't mean y'all y'all forget that if he more feet is last in Morpheus in a bride that's not a second person our problem is is we think we're it's a good person we're not we are the person of God manifested in another form this is the Spirit of God you see this you see one person is sitting on throne with a book right one guy's sitting on throne with a book in his hand and there's another man gonna come around a man cuz it says a man come around because a lamb can't take a book out of somebody's hand lamb don't have hands and a lamb can't be bloody once the lamb dies he's dead but this lamb could walked over to the throne where the Spirit of God was that I want you to look the Spirit of God the Son of God what was he down to the church ages he was revealed as the son of God upon this rock I'll build my church Peter says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God you thought that doesn't mean anything that means a lot the manifestation of God was the son of God down to the church ages not the son of man the son of man's two headstone that's why they're all in the grave right walked over to the throne where the Spirit of God was at and took the book out of the right hand remember right hand is what authority of him that sets upon the throne and all the elders fell down and said thou art worthy because thou was slain and then he become them watch this his book or at least the book of Redemption now look we're fixing he's fixing to open the seals and this is the book this is the book of redemption not the book of the devil we got to see this to continue into the seal we got to see this the book or at least a book of redemption or the book of intercession remember he was interceding he's still interceding but there's time watch the book of intercession in the church age was finished now he becomes the Redeemer now Redemption Redemption is to be revealed let's read this now the revealing of how he did it see I wasn't just saying that was my thought remember I said this is what happened but this is how he told us I didn't get that from my guy from him the revealing of how he did it is going to be in the seventh sense which is Revelation chapter six now we notice in that light when the book of the mediatorial work of him was done the work was finished now in the first three chapters of the church finished right here this is revelations one through three right and then wake up this is important Josh young set up all night and watch all you want to but you can't say turn but now redemption redemption is what to be revealed he's just not gonna take the book and just go no if this is the most greatest scripture in the Bible amen brother Brent said to scriptures Daniel 9 was the most important Scripture in the Bible revelations 5 was the most sublime Scripture in the Bible so those two to me revelation I mean Daniel 9 shows the redemption of Israel revelations 5 shows the redemption to me in here redemption is to be revealed what is it now when he took this book now try to put your deep thinking not your deep sleeping your deep thinking because we ever get these seven nights you're gonna get it you're gonna get it now well they didn't but he thought they might now let's go to number 10 number 10 breach we're gonna stand in the breach and he saw one sending him of the throne with this book in his hand and his right hand think of it now and then in this book what's the title deed to Redemption and it was sealed with seven seals now look so it was sealed with seven seals I've lost my seal here it is it's sealed with seven seals now obviously people obviously man thought for centuries that this seal was you and I yeah cuz even brother Branham preached this first seal was the Holy Ghost right so man through the ages thought this was something great that had to stop do me and you they missed this they missed this this was the revelation they were supposed to get not this so the profit comes Christ comes takes the sail off and then he walked reveals what's in the book then in this book was to end this book not old in in this book was the title deed to redemption and it was sealed with seven seals and then an angel come forth the strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to take the book who was able to open the seals who was able to open this book see the angel asked it John saw it and he said now who's worthy let him oh my maybe I'm just feeling this this away but let him said the angel lent him here is the book of redemption here is the plan of redemption listen to this here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed look how important not the seal what was written in the seal what was written behind the seal here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed for here is the title deed to redemption of the whole heavens and earth let him come forth if he will oh my now speaker forever hold his peace let him come forward and claim this book who is worthy to do it john said there was no man in heaven found worthy no man on earth found worthy no man beneath the earth that ever lived and died was found worthy no man was found worthy so who is worthy here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed I like that the only way that you'll ever be redeemed now we're gonna shift gears in just a second but let me give you this point right here believe it right there when he takes the book listen to me when he takes the book that means he's worthy right now what if he's worthy I hope you get this if he's worthy is he gonna reach and get a book that's dirty is he gonna reach and get a book that's sinful is he gonna reach and get a book this unworthy what's he reaching to get a book that's just as worthy and whose the book the book was standing there he said the standing there he's not gonna reason get something filthy folks this shows us that our redemption whenever he reached and got that book redemption was over when he took that book everybody had come to full Redemption hey Bobby change cuz he's not gonna get that book say when that legs up there's a part of it let me see that there's a I'm just gonna get about three pages of this book no without hesitation he reached and grabbed the book he said it's mine I have redeemed it and everybody that's in that book it's sealed in and there's no way that Satan can get him no way that man can touch this book the Lamb the one worthy reaching got something that was worthy oh I'm sorry that's the second person he raised and got himself gong can't you see that he got himself he didn't have a problem he woke up there now he had overcome he was worthy an angel said who is worthy everybody just kind of stood around but when he raised and got the book do you hear what happened I'll Hammond scream I'll scream everybody heard John scream and for he has redeemed us what Redemption listen revelation is father's not part Redemption that's full Redemption full Redemption body spirit and soul so the seals has to be connected to your body change it can't be just that Satan was a wild horse rider there's something lying underneath that something in Redemption that you and I have not seen yet cuz we're still here if he was worthy that book was worthy it had come to a place to where that book was just as worthy as he was because when he took it what was it he took that book he's a redemption is over now redemption is coming not three chapters later redemption is over when the lamb takes the book we'll read it maybe next time be the prophet of God said he said redemption was over no look Redemption was over for the foundational world but the acts of a play had to bring us down into time to this part here because look let me tell you something the reason I'm so hard on this about being worthy you can't understand when when you start really seeing the seals you see how he makes you worthy right you see how he makes you worthy he's worthy now we know that but like I said before when he reached and grabbed that book that book couldn't had one speck of sin in it so what was that book that book was none other than Genesis 1:26 through 27 let them have dominion over the fish of the sea in the fowl of the air and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth right what revelation 5 we just read it says kings and priests and we were what reign on this earth we will reign over there sir brother mom said if your priest or King you got to have a domain he said you are right there all right say ma'am number 12 no I'm sorry number 11 now let's shift gears here just a second watch so keep this in your minds for next time if the book is where if the man that takes is worthy the book is got to be worthy so the redemption has got to be done but we now just like the Prophet said we got to come back into revelation 6 and see how it happened hey man that's what he said but I watch an Elder came forth our strong angel said weep not for the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David he has prevailed a man conquered in other words he is worthy to take the book see I want to talk a little bit about overcoming later on because you got to have something to overcome before you can overcome it something's got to happen because each age got an overcoming our overcoming in this age come this age here is is that we could sit in his throne we'll talk about that next Sunday I was gonna take it today but I'm gonna come down to a spot right here and then stop and then we'll take it next Sunday cuz remember these these gifts and all these things in the Bible is only for overcomers there's not a person in the Bible that doesn't have a testimony there's not a person on a person sitting here if you don't have a testimony you're not born again well let me put it this way you could be in the process and that could be part of your testimony but born-again people have a testimony you know what it is it's true all the way through I can't get born again different than you as far as we come to one thing that we can all come different directions it may take some longer some walk some run some crawl right but we all come to one place that the word in you agrees the spirit and you agrees with the word that's been preached and it remains problem is we see all these people come running running running around running and then what they had a good anointing but they never had a possession now remember he's worthy to take the book he's been doing the work of the kinsman redeemer my own the rock yeah here's purple conquered in other words he's worthy to take the book hey man remember he hadn't seen him up on up to this time tell my John why he was sitting on a seated on the throne in there god stro he was on the inside of the sanctuary he wasn't st. he hadn't seen him to this time so John was expecting to see a line come forth but he saw a lamp all right now look a line doesn't redeem a lamb it's the only sacrifice there has never been a line sacrificed sorry no the line isn't overcomer the line is the tribe of Judah the line is the one that speaks amen but the lamb he's meat general you see the different characteristics but now remember same God but he can be a lion in a lamb at the same time but in this scene he has to play the part but watch but he saw a lamb now let's go to number 12 third seal Jeffersonville 1963 and then we went back gothic rent kinsman redeemer and picked him up see what's brother branham's doing he's he's going back to the to this to the breach in the third seal and when he went back got to the kinsman redeemer and picked him up to see what his work was and now for all these years Christ has been doing the kinsman redeemer work now all that understands that say man he has been doing the work of the kids remember lemur but there will come a time that when the redeeming work will be over and when the redeeming work is over then he leaves the throne of God where he's seated now but that's not his problem he that overcometh shall sit with me in my throne as I have overcome and have sit down on my Father's throne now that's revelations 3 verse I got it right here that's gonna read it but I'll read softer up there next Sunday that's revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne thought alright say man where he seated now but that's not his throne he that overcometh shall sit with me and my throne as I have overcome and have sit down on my Father's throne that is not his throne that belongs to Spirit God Christ the lamb it doesn't belong to him he is the Incarnate God which is the same God made incarnate now will we just kind of stop there because I just want to read a few of these kind of tickle your interest and next Sunday we'll continue right here on this but let me read a few more now look cuz remember who was the lamb the lamb was the Redeemer their lamb is the son of man God in human flesh but he's the son of God in the son of man we know that but he wasn't in that son of God manifestation at that time he was in the son of man hmm this is kind of strange but the son of God is the new birth right but the son of man came in flesh bled and died because a kinsman as son of God he couldn't bleed and die forth but when he in morphing into Son of Man that's when he could go back and redeem all his possession amen cuz look that all right look this right here never fell never never had a bad day this is Almighty God in another form called a bride this is the bride he was calling his bride right there in Genesis 1:26 amen created he them and let them have dominion over the fish of seeing the foul the air and whoever creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and God blessed them and said multiply and replenish the earth Lord these people hadn't even come to earth yet literally right they're already blessed they're already multiplied they already have a Dominion none other than Christ himself in the form of a bride this is you this is your bride amen but when we fell we had to get back to something right redemption is not dropping this and picking up this it's dropping this and picking this up and putting it the people in the message forget this you got to put it back where it was you can't just pick this up and sit it over here that's not where it fell from it fell from here it's got to be put back where it goes we'll see that into place into the seals that all right a couple more quotes and we'll be finished sorry too little loan today but that was the son of man God made incarnate hey man pull that back up again the third seal number 12 he is the Incarnate God which is the same God made incarnate now what is God incarnate guarding human flesh right okay now he rises from the seat first the announcement went forth who is able to come and take this book of redemption see for the whole plan of redemption from Adam from Adam all that Adam lost there was nothing lost until Adam and after Adam all was lost in the earth and everything on the creation of the earth was lost and everything fell with Adam cross the chasm that no one could get back to no way at all man when he sinned he left his way left no way back for himself and when this question was asked John the Revelator the Prophet John was in division look saw it there was no man in heaven no man earth no man beneath the earth nobody even worthy to look at the books you know just think of it then the lamb comes forward and he takes the book now John was asked not to weep any more he said Behold the line of Judah has prevailed and he can take the book and open it so he turned to look for a line and he saw a lamb the elder calls that a line has prevailed but when he come and look it was a lamb coming out growing on up now he'd never noticed that before why he had been back there in his doing as me tutorial work for he was bleeding for the people interceding for the people into the last soul that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world come in there's just going to be so many of them there and that's it that's all the others won't even want to come in they have no desire to come in so when that last soul has come in then the time of redemption is finished then the lamb comes forth to claim us rise to what is redeemed and that's all creation in the earth and everything belongs to him see he has redeemed it with his own blood that will read it next time you remember brother brother Bram talks about Christ getting an inheritance the inheritance that he inherited he'd give it to his children that's what this is amen mm-hmm and we'll read it next Sunday when he comes forth to take this book to open it while my they was John didn't weep anymore and he looked and this lamb was a slain lamb it had already been killed but it wasn't live again now we find out that a slain lamb is a bloody lamb bleeding all over picture of Calvary and then after he'd been slain it raised again and was sitting on the throne stayed back in behind the throne like this interceding for all those souls that would come that when the last one was here it was completed then God still held the book of redemption see he's just doing the kinsmen work now so we kind of backed up a little bit but look the line it's not a Redemption line the line is a judge when the mediatorial work is over he becomes a judge amen and we'll get to that we'll stop right here don't go any further than this now look he was bleeding for the people interceding intercessing for the people until the last soul that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world will come in that's just be so many so when that lasso comes in then the time of redemption is finished the lamb comes forth to take what he's redeeming and what is it all of creation souls in prison I'm gonna read this and real quick number 13 if you want to pull it out paragraph 148 John look to see a lamb or see a line and what did he find a lamb and it was a bloody lamb a lamb that had been slain how long since the foundation of the world the lamb came forth now look the lamb came forth in Revelation walked up what walked up to him - had the bookends right hand receive the book climbed up on the throne and sat down now that's not anywhere in the Bible but if you put the scripture together that he that overcometh them sit on my throne as I have overcome and set on the Father strong if you put those scriptures together the prophet knew exactly what he was talking about that's what's happening people with these seven thunders they're not written verbatim in the book but they're written from Genesis 1 all the way to revelations 20 the lamb came forth walked up to him that the bookends right hand and received the book climbed up on the throne and sat down that's it it was over when when the seals was revealed now I wrote myself a little note he said oh well then it should that's why everybody says Redemption was redemption was over in 1963 cuz I said well the seals were open sure that was a it was a doctrine daddy knows you can't be saved after 1963 cuz Redemption was over because what the lamb took the book it says when the seals was revealed right I thought I just read y'all the quote that it wasn't revealed back when he preached him when the last one that was everything that he had redeemed there was nothing he come to redeem why didn't he redeem them 40 years ago 2,000 years ago see their names are on the book of life in that book he had to stand here because it was God's purpose to redeem them their names were put on the Lamb's Book alive before the foundation of the world the lamb was put there with it so it's not two books the Lambs not a book and we're book it's the same book because when brother Brown said there stood the book you thought I talking about y'all he was telling about Christ he was talking about the lamb the book was standing there but you and I are part of that book the lamb was put there with it to be slain here comes the lamb when was slain come back to make intercession watch him there's a lot of impersonation listen there's a lot of impersonation Satan can impersonate but he cannot redeem me he can't call your name and give you eternal life so there's only one man right here showing us let Stan musicians come only one person look I'm not finished let me read the rest of this look watch this dot all right I just want you stand up so you go back to quit going back slate I get to sleep he cried so I have to be excited a little bit okay there'll be a lot of impersonation a lot of everything else but there was really somebody was gonna be saved for the church was predestinated to be without spot or wrinkle doesn't that make you worthy if you're without spot or wrinkle but look we got to realize cross it I'm the one that did it and I thought Paul said it was Christ in who you the hope of glory not Christ in Christ Christ in you the hope of glory think Christ in you the hope of glory we just have not but we haven't got to believe that yet we're believing on - we're believing because what we can't leave here until life's one comes in all right we can't leave here - last one comes in all right so the last one could be sitting in the messy Church I'm not you know I'm not physically looking for the last one because you know I've seen some people come in here I thought oh man it's about over with because that person I never thought would have come in ya'll said the same thing about me about 15 18 years ago I know that so anyway but then you see him leave or you see this one drift in you see just in our little congregation what about around the world oh but there will be like the Prophet said there will be somebody that will be the last one and when that person comes in you better be ready you better be already in the book you better already be the one that Christ talks about because when that door was shut they wasn't another person when in that are and God shut the door no it didn't hey man God shut the door I'm sure on the outside there's a bunch of little make believer standing at the door and all of a sudden when that door went heard the preachers the one time I'm Erin Ellen who it was the preacher said I bet you they because you know it was pitched on the inside the outside with tar he said I bet you there was fingernail marks all up them down that I bet there was people trying to get in when that water was coming up and you know what it was too late they had a hundred and twenty years good grief God don't give me 120 years you're getting close but don't give me 120 years I'm ready to get out of here but when the last one comes in we're gonna leave but you know what the last one came in that can't come in until they're preached - amen you love Lord thank God for all things but look if he took that book he's worthy and what's in the books got to be worthy to you remember them go ahead 299 the read vote when we all get to heaven they meant 299 in a red book no love [Music] he'll dream ever us away oh when will Oh - hey [Music] we want the pill Wow Oh Fred [Music] No [Applause] when we Oh what [Music] [Applause] [Music]
