========================================

[Music] pour out your power as ways [Music] Oh I want to see praise the Lord Jesus amen it's good to be on the house of the Lord this evening and appreciate each and every one of you coming out to hear the word of God this evening it's good to have brother Wade back and glad the Lord watched over him as he was traveling and my daddy natella loose okay all right vennett is gonna be my voice hey man praise the Lord Jesus all right so I'm gonna try not to keep you all along this evening and then I know it's it's getting dark now soon it's already dark out there and it's very cold out there so we want to go ahead and go to the word and in John chapter 15 let's go to John chapter 15 John 15 started at verse one Bible says I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring more fruit now now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and there's withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you amen herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit you want to know how to glorify the Father that's how the father is glorified when you're bearing fruit by the word that you're receiving amen the father is being glorified praise the Lord so shall ye be my disciples and let's just skip down to verse 16 it says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it you Amen Lord I'd a blessing through the word let's just go ahead and have a word of Prayer our Heavenly Father we we thank you lord once again for the opportunity to come to church lord thank you Father God for know we know father God that you said where there's two or three gathered in your name you said you said that there would be you would be in their mist and we believed that tonight we're claiming it father God so father God speak to us through your word because father God you said in your word father God that your word is spirit in life Lord and Lord God let your life father God just shine upon us Lord and and Lord changes from the inside out Lord God Almighty revealed to us your word Lord God so that we can go live your word Lord help us father god bless your people now and meet every need that's amongst us and every request that was made Lord God may you meet these needs father God we commit ourselves now into your hands and we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen and man you may be seated Saints praise the Lord amen I just want to give a little title tonight maybe we would do a little study tonight maybe I'll call it what kind of fruit are you bearing what kind of fruit are you bearing in you know this scripture here in John chapter 15 is a it's one of my favorite scriptures and really this stems a lot from like the last time when we had the the last youth service the last Youth Saturday service because to me when when this particular scripture is one of the scriptures that helped me understand the new birth and and and and so one of one of several but I want to try to see if maybe this evening if maybe we can kind of maybe simplify a little bit a little bit if we can you know and and just try to see what we'll see what the Lord does amen to find out exactly Saints because we have to remember that whatever a tree out here is meant to give fruit you know there's a fruit that it's supposed to give right and whatever fruit it's supposed to give if the tree of this oak tree out here is given forth some oranges or a pecan tree is given forth oranges something is wrong right something something something's not right something something's crossed something that something's not right you see and so therefore when we are supposed to be meant amen full of the Word of God living through us amens in an abiding in us amen and if we're given something different contrary to the word then something must be wrong something that something is not right in our life amen praise the Lord Jesus so by the help of the Lord Amen let's just see where the Lord leads us tonight so in Jesus Christ said in in in John chapter 15 and verse 1 there it says I am The True Vine and my father is the husband man now I like the way he words it there because he is the True Vine that's the reason why he said I am the way the truth and the life amen that no man can come to the Father except by me except by him right praise the Lord he's the only one that he can say I am thee and be correct praise God but it's in this last day Amen when you and I began to say I am my father are one I am the Bride of Christ I am God amen in flesh today amen people don't like to hear that amen you'll get persecuted for sure I am The True Vine my and my and my father is the husbandman praise the Lord Jesus and so there if you read in John chapter 14 verses 5 through 7 the Bible says there Thomas saith unto Him Lord we know whither thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so there's no salvation in any other except Jesus Christ there is no salvation than in any man there's no salvation and in what you can do you can do nothing to save yourself and that's the reason why it has helped me and I hope it helps you sings a mint that sometimes we we feel so condemned when we may be done wrong and I hope this helps our younger people maybe sometimes we did something wrong we've done something and you know what you if you just get to the mindset and say lord I can't save myself there's nothing I can do to take this sin off of my off of my life done it I confessed it and you Lord you already did it for me so now you take care of the rest they meant and when you take God that way amen God will be able to do more things for you than what you can imagine he'll take care of that sin because why you believed his word you believed what he did for you amen and then the rest of it is in his hands praise the Lord amen so that that's how God wants us to to approach him so simply you know sometimes we think that we just need to be crawling on our knees for fifteen hours or or doing some sort of petting and penitence or or something but saying it's just as simple as taking God Lord you said it you did it you said it I believe it I'm confessing it to you and the Lord says I like to hear my word back at me so let me just go ahead and apply what my breath my son or my daughter's request an amen praise God that's how you have to do that's as simple as that praise God if he had known me then and continuing there in John 14 if he had known me Jesus speaking you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him Amen because jesus said if you have seen me you've seen the father there was no difference in between em it was just that he was being manifested in flesh at that time you see praise the Lord Amen so now if if we read here in the next verse there in in John chapter 15 and verse 2 it says every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away you see so if there's a I mean if you gardeners or in you any of you that deal with horticulture you know if there's if you plant something you meant for it to give forth a certain fruit an apple tree and if it's not given anything you know it's just in the way you know it's dead something's wrong right and so that's the same thing here you're gonna do something about it you're gonna cut it away you're gonna do you're gonna take it away and that's what jesus said here every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away there is going to be people in this life they're not gonna bury any fruit whatsoever they're not gonna they're not going to bear they're not going to bear anything they were they were put in this life amen for that purpose amen praise God but you and I Saints if the Word of God has come to us amen and has in his abiding in us we're supposed to give off fruit an abundant fruit and let me tell you what Saints that fruit is not for you to enjoy because a tree out here an apple tree out here doesn't give fruit for him itself to eat that of that fruit neither there's an orange eat of its own fruit that fruit that you and I give is for each other to eat enjoy the fruit that brother Wade gives off a man is for me to enjoy the fruit that brother Dale gives off is for me to enjoy the brother Marcus other brother Boyd is for us to enjoy one another amen it's God's fruit amen so now we have to make sure and we have to look and say Lord what kind of fruit am i given is it positive fruit or is a negative fruit amen or no fruit at all you have no hope then but now we could be given negative fruit some sort of rotten fruit it's fruit but it might be rotten and I don't want to eat off of that you see I want something God who likes a good juicy nice crisp apple red apple or Granny Smith whatever amen no nothing out nothing rotten and then when you bite into it there's a worm sticking out like this and saying you know you don't want anything like that amen but sometimes saying say man we have to step back and take a look and say you know what am I just given half half half fruit you know half half a part you know how part rotten and part good oh well now I'm going to eat at Apple I won't eat the whole thing I want to enjoy everything that God has for you sir amen that God is working in your life praise the Lord and every branch that beareth fruit he purchased it that it may bring forth more fruit now Paul speaks of this fruit in in Galatians chapter 5 and the brothers could bring it up in Galatians chapter 5 verses 16 through 24 and Paul says here it's interesting what a ringlet we're gonna see if we can bring a couple of things from this he says here this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh now what does it mean to walk in the spirit well what is the spirit amen the spirit is God's own life amen you see that's the reason why Jesus said if you abide in me and my spirit abides in you then ask what you wish amen so it's God's own life so if you have God's own life amen you should be walking in the spirit amen how many understand that is that clear so far man if God's Holy Spirit is abiding in your life then you should be walking in the spirit so in other words not walking in yourself walking in the spirit of God as the spirit giveth to you then you will be walking in that you see I meant because it's God's own life amen and so the spirit here in this verse is is God is God himself in John 6:63 Jesus says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing amen the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life you see so when you're walking in the spirit that means you're walking in the word amen is it simple enough I hope this is making this little simple of it when you have the Holy Spirit of God amen that means you're feeding off the Word of God right off the life of the word Amen not off brother Dale or brother waiter he or any about amen we're just here a man just proclaiming that life you see but then that life Amen should change you from the inside out a man pushing out to be able to push out the fruit that God wants you to to Express you see Amen so so continuing here in Galatians for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh see when you don't have that that struggle in your life then something is wrong when you're not when you're not struggling you're in your life a man I used to love this and now for some reason I just don't I'm struggling I want to do it but then I don't I wanna I want to get be involved with this and then I don't you see and then it becomes a struggle it becomes a and if that struggle is not a new Saints Amen then somebody you we need to repent we need the Holy Spirit we don't have the Holy Ghost amen because the Christian the the life of a Christian saints is a battle it's a tug-of-war a man it's like that it's like that that that black him that black and white dog that brother branham gave that example amen when they asked that Indian up in there Alaska a man who is it that there wins it says it's the dog that did I feed the most the dog that you feed the most or in other words the the man that you feed the most amen the the the the one that you feed the most the flesh or the spirit is the one that's going to end up winning why can I overcome this are you feeding that are you constantly I can't overcome it I can't overcome and then you're constantly born back and forth back and forth repenting for the same thing over and over and over amen are you feeding that because if you feed it then it's gonna continue to win right very simple concepts in the word he meant but we just want to try to keep it a little simplified tonight amen praise God so so for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other that's the reason why Saints that makes in the world with the church doesn't doesn't doesn't mix it's like oil and water to the world it seems okay that's why when you go to a church one of these secular churches and you see all the other all the lights and all the all the dancing and all the another it's like it's like a holy club supposedly oh you know I might as well just go back to the club right where I used to hang out you know that's the real thing this is all mixed you see so this stuff doesn't mix and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that you would now verse 18 but if you'd be led of the Spirit you are not under the law now I like I like how Paul says that there amen and in later on in in the in the next few verses he'll mention something else regarding that but Saints really I was to be Catholic and I used to I know how it was like that you do to try to do works to get the favor of God to get the favor of the Virgin Mary and all those things I know about those things and and and so but there is once the Holy Spirit is living your life there is you there is no more law because Saints you become a law within yourself God already fulfilled the law for you you see God in in the Old Testament Jesus the the the Lord gave the Israelites the law because they wanted it so really in them doing that it was actually showing them grace but they him God knowing that they could not and no human being ever could fulfill that law so what happened Jesus Christ came and lived on earth and He fulfilled the law himself died on the cross and then came back in the form of the Holy Spirit and now that same spirit that fulfilled that that fulfilled the law already a man that is a law within that's his own law amen now he can give us that conquering power in you and I so that's the reason why Paul says here but if you be led of the Spirit you have God's own life you are not under the law you're not under the law of Christ because why he's already fulfilled it for you praise the Lord you don't have to live under the law if you if you let the Spirit of Christ amen guide your life you have to worry that I gotta do this I gotta do that I have to I have to do this that or the other no the Holy Spirit in you will automatically amen let things come out forth amen as you continue to feed on the word amen as you continue to feed on a drink from this water now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God amen just like in John 15:2 that we just read you know God will just cut them right off the branch amen but the fruit of the Spirit now watch verse 22 but the fruit of the Spirit you see the Spirit has fruit the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance watch against such there is no law there is no law because why those things when the Holy Ghost is in your life amen those things are automatically couldn't be coming out of you amen and there's no law against that right in other words let's say I'm out here driving and there I see a sign that says don't drink and drive I think brother wait is given this this example before don't drink and drive well if if I don't drink that law doesn't apply to me you see and that's the same thing with the word Amen all these things he got see Paul mentioned all these things idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife all those things but there here comes the luck that here comes the life of Christ amen and if the life of Christ is dwelling in you then none of those things have anything against you there's no law wait for the that you you have you have not you don't have to worry about you trying to live the law again because the law has already been fulfilled because that life is living in you how many understand amen the life of God living the law through you amen praise God living the word through you amen praise God but the fruit of spirit now all right so meekness temperance against such there is no law amen and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts amen praise God so daily that we live Saints we have to crucify ourselves more and more the more we crucify ourselves the more we continue to feed off the word the more of God the more of the life of God should be reflecting in our lives and then and the more of the fruit that you're gonna be bearing God's fruit you see more of that fruit that you're gonna bear and so that I can enjoy awful amen same thing from you with me and you amen and the message that laman brother Branham says here and now the fruit of the Spirit is not joining church the fruit of the Spirit is not smoking cigarettes the fruit of the I mean quit smoking cigarettes the fruit of the Spirit is not to speak with tongues the fruit of the Spirit is not to pray for the sick and they be healed the fruit of the Spirit is not prophesy or preach but the fruit of the Spirit is found in Galatians 5:22 love joy peace goodness long-suffering faith meekness gentleness that's the fruit of the Spirit now no matter how much you preach you got a real LLL telll temper don't do you much good to preach see no matter how much you join church and try to impersonate if you're crabbing and nasty with your neighbor you'll never win him to Christ then all right see it's the fruit of the Spirit as my wife used to tell me actions speak louder than words that's right live me a sermon instead of preaching me one that's a good thing leave them live me a sermon amen god help us amen we want to live more of the words because Saints the word is it's good to another word amen but what is the word it what what's the use of knowing the word if you don't live it God wants us to manifest the word and the word amen as I've said before the only things that you'll take away a man from this life is what you do for Christ and what you do for others and what you do is living the word you see because I could have it here but doesn't mean I'm doing it hey man it's two different things I mean I want I want to do the word amen praise the Lord now if we continue in John chapter 15 and verse 2 there again it says there in the last part it says now in every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit amen now I don't know if you if any of you all have dealt with roses or deal with gardens and things like that I I have thing here where it says that the the importance of pruning roses one of the reasons one of the reasons that it's important is because it removes the dead and diseased branches and so roses get dead and diseased branches and they're also called canes it rejuvenates the plant and encourages blooming encourages airflow through the shrub and controls the size and the shape of the plant you see so as your as a gardener a menu you you're you're the husband then you know you're caring for your for your rose why because you wanted to do to to look more beautiful to give forth that it's fragrance to give forth more of what it was meant to give amen and therefore Saints God is this does the same thing with you and I through what through trials and tribulations the more mature of God God is going to want to make sure that you could give fruit at the maximum level God is not satisfied with 50% when he knows you can give a hundred and ten God is not satisfied with 20% when he knows that you can give a hundred amen he's gonna do everything he can to get you to reach that that fullness amen praise God and so sometimes a man he looks and sees Wow I see that for the mark I'm not saying that you do brother mark but for the mark has a long tongue I had him cut here a little bit coat over here all right now he's turned a little bit more sharp no but you know he he's gonna cut wherever and this person here you know too much lying in their life or or too much cheating too much of this that dieter the other Amen too many dirty jokes or whatever let me cut something in his life they men why because if you claim that you have the Holy Spirit in your life and it's God's own life in you and you're not manifesting you're manifesting rotten fruit amen he's gonna want to make sure that you continue to manifest more fruit for him amen because I cannot if I if if I am to feed off of you my man I can't feed off your dirty jokes I can't feed off you know the the things that the cheating lines stealing or whatever amen praise God and you can name it well you you you you know what you have struggled with each and every one of us has struggles in our lives you know your struggle and you know what to do amen to keep that covered amen and if you don't Satan's gonna continue to punch that if you don't keep it covered if you don't keep that amen constantly amen hidden and covered amen Satan knows where to punch so God is going to purge you they men and it's through trials and tribulations a man and you know what Saints the cleansing starts with the word sometimes I mean the word can go forth and it can be so it could be so it could be so hard to receive amen but cleansing comes from the word if it's the word if it's the truth if it's truth a man it might be hard but it but but it'll help us why because God wants us to produce better fruit amen wants us to produce more fruit hey man he's not satisfied with just 50% when he knows that you can yield more because he knows you Amen he created you praise God and he knows that that life in you amen is his life praise the Lord now look what it says here in in in verse 3 it says now now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you now he is talking to the disciples there and he's telling them he's they're clean with the word amen that he has spoken Amen but we know that they still needed the Holy Ghost because we know what Peter did amen he still he still denied even though he was cleansed by the word a man he was being sanctified by the word he still denied Jesus that's the reason why Saints you've got to have an experience with God you've got to have the new birth for yourself amen and it's a continual process in your life I mean the disciples they were there listening to Jesus they were living with Jesus receiving his word for three and a half years and they thought they oh my this is the maximum this is this is probably I'm just thinking oh this is the this is the fullness we can't get better than this and yet through let's just take Peter for example through what he did denying denying Jesus he probably realized I don't have what I thought that I had I need more of him amen that you wonder why he wept bitterly for one the crow would you know the crow the the crowed and fulfilling what Jesus said that he was gonna do and - he probably thinking you know what I don't I don't have the goods that I thought I had and that's the question saying soon when I asked ourselves do I have what I think I have amen again are you bearing the fruit that you are supposed to bear we don't want to just be satisfied Amen with what we have III know there's more of him Amen because there's more of his word his word is continually meant praise God Ephesians 5:25 says here in verse 3 verse 27 husbands love your wives I'm not gonna speak about this but so don't worry husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word now you see Saints the water is the word as the reason when God was speaking when Jesus would speak the Nicodemus he says you must be work born again born again of this of the the spirit and and of the water and spirit well the water in the spirit is both the word it's not anything different it's both the word they meant that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen you know Saints when you it's interesting that Paul that Paul says they're without spot or wrinkle when you sisters or when you brothers I hope you brothers too when you get to ironing your shirt or something like that amen when you you know you get the iron and you know you can't just have heat on its own I mean you need to have a little moisture in there yeah you say you need to have some water in there in order to get the wrinkle out amen but now you can't just have the water by itself either you've got to have the heat in there too in order to remove the wrinkle that's the reason why you need the water which is the word great to have the word great day man but you also need those trials that heat a man in order to get the wrinkles out of your life amen you need both of those things together and that's the reason why he said that he's gonna have us a spotless church without spot or wrinkle and that's the only way he's gonna do it continue to give you more trials amen continue put that heat on you amen okay as you continue to receive the word expect for more than four more trials to come into your life for more heat amen because he's trying to iron out wrinkles from your life amen because he wants to have us a spotless and a ring CLIs church amen praise God so you know as the preacher is there preaching you know and he's there preaching that's where he spread you know those those irons where you at water going forth and then all right they received the word that feels great and there's a every but it caused us some steam it causes something to rise amen something happens when that takes place right causes a reaction that's the reaction that God wants from you amen praise the Lord that amen praise God so that water and their spirit amen we know is that word amen jesus said John in John 17:17 sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth amen thy Word is truth amen praise the Lord so so and just like the iron Saint you know a tree can't grow without water see the branch is it can't it can't produce branches they can't grow it can't you can't go to his potential without water and of course they cannot grow without without heat or sunlight you see it needs both of those elements and they may in order to grow and that's why you and I Saints we need both of those elements in order to grow praise God we need to have Amen trials to come our way every now and then whoever said to you that the Christian life is easy and it's a flowery bread of bed better v's Amen is lying to you and it's probably trying to get your money because as many of you have tested Pali testified that the Christian life is not easy but it's very worth it it's very worth it email so just keep pressing on st. John SEP John chapter 7 Amen I was looking at this here a little bit ago and it's interesting what Jesus says here the brothers don't have this but they can bring it up if they want John chapter 7 verse 30 vii says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water now Jesus is here speaking these things you know and he's saying these things and of course the new birth couldn't come he at that time because look what the next verse says it says but this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so it took the disciples received the word Amen for three and a half years right they received that water that water was cleansing them amen but it wasn't a man it didn't vent that that that word that they received didn't come to fruition until the day of Pentecost you see when they were in the upper room then that word a man that Jesus came in in the in the form of the Holy Spirit amen and now have vindicated that word in their life that now it wasn't just in their in their in their head a man but now they acted upon the word I am you see now Peter went out and he and with boldness the Bible says and he was able to preach the word and speak the word and and and and and it would be word on top of word word on top of word amen as you if you've read there in Acts chapter 2 so you know that's one of the things Saints that when the Holy Spirit is working in your life as the word is going forth you'll see that it'll just be word on top of word word on top of word and and things start clicking thing things starts things start clicking I remember brother uh the the the last podcast I did with brother Steven coffee from from from North Carolina and he gave gives a testimony there of how when the Lord was dealing with him at fifty you know when he he believed he the Lord death started dealing with him around twelve for 1314 years old but when God really when he knows that God filled him with the Holy Ghost a man he says the word just became a brand new book to him it was it was it was it was he got to himself amen and just to him him in the word amen and and and just like things were just clicking one on top of the other one on top of the other I mean and that's what it's supposed to be because it's the life of Christ amen it's the life of Christ revealing itself through your life praise the Lord Amen praise God you know Saint you take the woman at the well you know Jesus Jesus the woman at the well went to to seek physical water instead found spiritual water easy and there and there Jesus she Jesus to start the conversation asks her give me the drink doesn't even doesn't even ask please the Bible doesn't say but give me the drink and but he knew that that was the way to start that conversation you see a man and the conversation goes Amen and and and and as he's and and as he's discerning her amen she realizes she realizes that that word a man she had heard she had to have heard the word at some point in her life because the by but the Bible says that we know that when Messiah comes he's tell us these things you see and he'll tell us all things about is what everyone says and then when the word amen when he says to her when he says to her I am he that speaks to you a man she drops the water pot and runs a man and tells the whole the whole people everybody in her town says come see Amanda told me all things in other words confirmed to me what I had already knew amen and of course we know that's not you know she did that wasn't the feeling of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Jesus hadn't died yet amen but still it's sparked amen something in her II meant that to see that that's Messiah amen praise God and so Saints you know if the word doesn't come across into your life amen you you in order for for God to reveal the word - you have to be in the word that's the reason why we have to be at church that's the reason why we have wherever the word is Amen let's try to be there let's try to constantly amen listen to the word being the word Amen because how can the word be revealed to you if you are not in the word you want a revelation from God God's not gonna give you a revelation through a comic book he's not gonna give you a revelation through Netflix he's gonna give you a revelation through his word Amen that is the water a man that's gonna a man continue to wash you and and eventually will you get a revelation some things we don't understand in the word I think I don't understand everything in the Bible I can't explain everything Amen but I know if I stay in that word eventually it will be revealed through prayer as well amen and God knows your intention in your heart amen he knows why if you if you ask the Lord in a humble heart and you say Lord reveal this to me I don't understand it I want to know I believe there's something there amen God will reveal it to you amen God knows God knows your intentions in your heart and there Jesus said to her to the woman there at the will whosoever drinketh of this water again while he had said there in John 7 whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again that water there in that well she was gonna thirst again if she drank from that well so was Jesus there in the flesh amen but he says here but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life amen praise the Lord all right now continuing here in John 15 Jesus continues to say abide in me and I in you all right as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself that's the reason why Saints you cannot live the Christian life on your own there's nothing you can do to please the to please the Lord on your own amen you have to be connected to that life amen praise God except as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me praise the Lord you see Saints see you right let's just pretend this as a tree right here just for that for the for the kids you have this tree right here and let's just pretend this is the branch yeah all right and if this branch you know if I just put this branch right here down here on the floor is it gonna buy is it gonna is it gonna produce any fruit why not it's next to the to the tree I mean it's right right there right next to the tree or shouldn't it give off fruit it's sitting it's in close proximity it goes to church it reads the message it reads the Bible it shakes the pastor's hand it acts very nice around their Christians but why is it not given enough fruit right Kaylee why is it not giving any fruit cuz its underground [Laughter] that's right it's on the ground it's not giving in your fruit amen because it's not connected right see when it's connected then it will be able to give our fruit glory right praise the Lord same thing with us Saints if you're not connected with God if you're not connected in the word if then the word is not going to pur be able to help produce fruit in your life right if you're just a church comer if you're just if you're just a benchwarmer that that's all you are a man and you expect for the word to live out through you it won't happen but once you connect through the word once once and God is revealing that word to you and even and it's manifesting through your life amen then you're gonna be able to produce fruit you see so I hope you hope that made a little clearer praise God you have to be connected in Christ right amen and you have a man you have to have that word abiding in you and him about and him you abiding in him and him abiding in you praise God and that word abide is the word Meno which means to abide to remain to dwell to continue to tarry to endure amen praise God it's to stay it's eternal amen like when brother Aaron when when brother Aaron was looking him and his family we're looking for a home for a house they weren't looking for a house to just live everyone now and then to be in it for for a month and then leave six seven months and then and then come back no they were looking for a house to make it a home that they can constantly dwell in and that especially like nights like this night right they have a home that they can go to there's got heat and then you you see and that's the same thing with Christ Saints God doesn't want to do and you every now and then when he gives you the Holy Ghost amen it's an eternal to seal a man and he can't get out and st. can't get in praise God a man it's he doesn't want to dwell every now and then oh I'll come back I'll go to church for just a few a few days a few Sundays and then maybe stay out for about six months amen no the life of Christ doesn't produce that Amen if the life the life of crisis is eternal and it's constant amen and it's full praise God so it's gonna make you produce amen something consistently right you see praise God because why we are we need to produce that fruit amen and verse 5 it says and I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing you can't do it on your own you you you need him you you you you've got to depend on him amen praise God praise the Lord Jesus and and see Saints that in a tree or in a vine see Jesus has given this example here of a great bond you see of a great vine and in the branches branching off of a great vine but those those branches amen should be made of the same material as the vine you see there's no different material it's the same material and that's the reason why it produces the same life praise God because those branches they're connected to the vine so just you know just like the the the you know if if that microphone which represents the branch was just sitting there next to the to the tree it was not gonna produce anything it could even be made of the same material but it was broken off at some point you see it won't produce any fruit right amen praise God and verse 6 it says if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned amen so you know Saints we're we're doing damage to ourselves amen if if we don't abide in Christ amen amen you reap what you sow amen you you reap what you sow praise God if you abide in me verse 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you jesus said in John chapter 8 verse 31 it says he says here's to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed if you continue being washed by the water of the word if you continue in that life then are you my disciples indeed praise God and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free praise God amen you stay you stay in the truth amen you stay in Christ amen knowing the truth they men the truth will set you free praise God for whatever it is that you may be struggling with whatever it is in your life amen truth always will set you free amen praise God herein is my father glorified back to back to John chapter 15 herein is my father glorified that ye bear just a little bit of fruit hmm what does it say there in verse eight you bear much fruit amen now remember that fruit is the fruit of the Spirit right which is the fruit of the word which is the fruit of the life which is the fruit of the the water and the spirit a man it's all the same thing it's all interconnected if you can understand that Saints a man it will help you in your Christian walk with Christ amen you know it'll take doubts it out in your life amen am I born again or not it might and my you know it might you know if you can understand then ask God if you don't understand it God reveal it to me cuz I want to understand their hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples Amen just as he said there if you continue in my word then are you my disciples and Vesey praise God hmm where are we alright now in verse 16 it says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain right and if it's the fruit of the Spirit Saints it's going to remain praise God it's it's it's eternal hey man it's it it will remain a man if it's the spirit a man but it but whatever whatever your agenda your own thoughts your own things that will never remain see that's the reason why these doctrines are about throughout all these all these all these decades you know different decades these past few decades where are they now they haven't remained amen praise God but if it's if it's from the Word of God if it's if it's the doctrine of the word amen the doctrine of what the prophet preached and the doctrine of the word amen it will remain praise God and if it's the true Holy Ghost in you it will remain amen I mean those those works that she do they men that our Holy Spirit our Holy Spirit guided amen they will remain a man they will they will God God doesn't overlook those things amen God one day we'll you know sometimes we may not understand we may not know somebody out there praying for you and it might be the the least person you'd think in the in the church that doesn't it's not the quietest person in the church and that person probably is gonna have a lot of tributed to her him because Amen those works those fruits remain praise God you see that's that's eternal fruit amen praise God so in Luke chapter 11 it's because Jesus said there at you if you about if he shall if you are if you abide in me and I own I abide in you then whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give it to you see so you have confidence in God now amen when you abiding the word a man when you when you when you and you let the word about in you amen you have confidence to ask whatever you want amen whatever you need and he can give it to you in Luke chapter 11 verse 9 it says ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth you see and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened man but the key thing is there is to seek to knock and to look for and that's the parts that we struggle with we don't do that therefore we don't receive therefore it's not opened unto us how am I gonna go to a man to brother Dale's house and and then I didn't let him know that that I'm goin but when I go there and if I don't knock the door how is he supposed to know that I'm outside wanting to come in and fellowship with him if I don't ring the doorbell you see same thing with Christ if you don't seek am a man if you don't do what you're supposed to do amen how is he supposed to bless you if you're not in the word how is he gonna best see through the word if you're not if you're not in it you want revelation from God amen get in the word right praise God if a Sun shall last bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone if I go and knock it brother Del's door a man will he will he open his window how he supposed to open his door right because I want to come in you see I'll be right out there no and then never comes to the door no I expect for him to open the door right if a son shall last bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will here well he for a fish give him a serpent you see you as a father you wouldn't do that to your child you know you wouldn't get you they'd ask they'd ask you for some food a man you'd give him something else you know some a stone or whatever you know you'd give him what they need or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Jane amen how much more you ask him amen and you ask him in truth in the word amen and say Lord I want that I may not understand it fully but I want it and Saints you know it doesn't have to it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be a bunch of emotion it doesn't have to be a bunch of shouting him and if the Lord deals with you that way that's great that's that's wonderful amen but remember how the new birth takes place amen you've got to get the baby here first when you get the baby amen when a mom is pregnant and she gives birth they meant to the baby that's the birth amen then the shouting and the screaming and the crying happens after the baby is born you see I've never heard the baby crying inside the stomach I hope no I mean I don't know a few sisters I my wife I don't think she ever when she had our two children it's never happened that way it's the baby comes out first usually they're quiet they're not saying anything right and the water is involved and the blood is involved and I'm sorry it sounds gruesome but but but but the Bible types it this way you see then the baby comes out and then POW smacks it and then the baby starts crying if the baby doesn't cry automatically right that's when does jumping and shouting and screaming and then and that rejoicing and all that stuff that's when it's good then but don't put the cart before the horse just because you screamed and shouted and and then glory hallelujah all throughout the building and everything that that's wonderful you did that but that does it that doesn't guarantee a new birth get the birth first and then those things will come after I meant then Amen that that's just icing on the cake then but some people Saints I don't understand that and they think that the new birth is because I shouted somewhere I screamed that the altar I or I did this and that and the other and there's a lot of confusion about that it about the new birth because of that amen and we'll finish off with this here Saints brother Branham says here and lamb and dove in in lemon Davis's you know a sheep a sheep is very sensitive and odd animal and you know a sheep never was asked to manufacture a wool he was asked to bear wool because he is a sheep and as long as he is a sheep he will bear wool because that's his nature you see a sheep bears wool because he's a sheep you see a dog has fur you know because he's a dog right a Christian bears the fruits of the Christian because he's got Christ's life living in him you see because Saints if I was if I had the life of one of these singers out here modern singers I don't know who they all are demi lovato or whatever you know all these are these singers that are out there if I had the life of Demi Lovato and me I'm gonna dance and sing and and and like Demi Lovato whatever her name is if I had the life of Michael Jackson living in me I'm gonna do the moonwalk and dance like Michael Jackson and and wear rhinestone gloves and you know that's why that's why you wonder if some of these impersonators you know that person a Elvis and and but you wonder what kind of spirits well it goes in them because some of them look exactly like the person now take that Saints in the physical and you see how people can be just like the person right I mean I've seen some very close people that look just like Michael Jackson and you take Saints the spirit of Christ if the Spirit of Christ is dwelling in you nobody will confuse you is that Michael Jackson or is that Jesus Christ no people are gonna know that's Jesus Christ Laurie that's Christ in her because no shine oh she can't do that that's got to be the that's got to be the Spirit of Christ in her a man I know he can't do that or she can't he can't live that way that's got to be something higher than him or her amen nobody will confuse if you're Christian or not when you really have the Holy Ghost in your life nobody well nobody will confuse and say do you really believe the are you really a Christian so that's why we have to be careful amen when we're trying to put in some of these worldly things in the church you see sometimes you don't want to look like the world the spirit of Christ that means the spirit is turning leaning back to some other entity when it's leaning toward the world it's leaning back to the club it's leaning back to a man but when the spirit amen when you see the sisters dressing right when you see the man hey man they're not out there Worley and all these things amen that means the spirit is leaning a man towards the Spirit of Christ amen amen was that is that simple enough amen praise God and so it is with the Christian and so here and so that that that that sheep was was just bears wool and as long as he is a sheep he will bear wool because that's his nature and so is it with the Christian Church when we were never asked to manufacture fruits we were asked to bear fruits Galatians 5 said the fruit of the Spirit is love joy faith peace long-suffering meekness gentleness gentleness patience these are not to be manufactured in other words you you can't try to do that on your own you can't try to live the Christian life on your own because you will miserably fail you're under the law you see there to be products that comes from the inside out the outside life that we live proves what's on the inside so the way you dress the way you the way you act and the way you you show yourself truly shows what's on the inside what's working inside now we have tried to manufacture this to manufacture the fruits of the Spirit and we always turn out hypocrisy because you cannot manufacture Christianity it's an experience by a spirit that lives in you and bears fruit of itself you cannot manufacture it we have tried to educate it and denominated and when we do we turn our hypocrisy and failure it's not to be done that way it's to be done as God intended it to be done the spirit inside of us bearing fruits of its presence I like that the spirit inside of us the Spirit of God inside of us bearing its fruit because it's dwelling in us I see of its presence that's God's program can never be changed praise God and in the last quote and we'll finish with this Saints and as I said this morning queen of sheba 1961 as I said this morning if the first branch of the vine brought forth a Pentecostal church every real branch out of that vine will bring forth another Pentecostal church but we got a lot of grafted branches and they bring forth after their kind we got Methodist branch grafted into it Baptist branch Pentecostal branch every other kind of branch it bears its own fruit you can take a orange tree and put a grapefruit in it it'll live off the life of that tree but it'll bear great fruit and this is this is this is for another topic but but it'll bear a great fruit but put a lemon in there it'll bear lemon not in orange yes it's living off orange life see that's that's that's the thing Saints you can live off the life of this message amen you can live off the life of going to church in other words of living off the boat the motions of going to church and and being at church and and and and maybe every now and then reading a Bible verse and every now and then listening to a scripture or listening to a message you can live off of that but again that doesn't mean that you're connected that doesn't that just that just means you're living down here you're living next to it you understand what I'm trying to say you're just living next to a beige it's not producing true fruits that's two different things any church professing to be a Christian thrives off the glory and praises of Christ but it can't bear the fruit it won't bear the life of Christ until Christ puts forth that branch himself then it'll it'll write another book of Acts behind it that's right because it is the acts of the Holy Spirit in the church amen so it is the acts of the Holy Spirit in you and I Saints when the Word of God amen when the spirit is living in us praise God and how does how does the spirit amen how do you receive the spirit through the continue if you continue in my word right it's not because you came over here and prayed right that's good that's wonderful and we need that but if you the word is the ultimate if you continue in my word jesus said not in my word but in Jesus word then you are my disciples indeed man praise Lord I mean he loved the Lord tonight I hope that was very simple and very and very uh you know I hope that you receive something off and Saints the main thing is to go out and do go and act on the word right live the word there's many people out here there are thirsty to see the word manifest they all they see is hypocrisy and all I see is nonsense amen and all they see is Whirley ISM in the church amen but you be the one you be the the change that people are looking for because you have the the one that that can make the change inside of you Amen Lord bless you all and may listen to our feet unless how the musicians come praise the Lord other boy lists let's just sing something whatever you have praise God if you have it need a prayer we're more than glad to be pray for you standing on the promise [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord Jesus standing on that word amen praise God just want to say it's good to see our brother here tonight
