========================================

it picks up fine really it does right i mean it picks up fine you really this thing is just kind of go through there really it would go through there we could run it through these speakers if somebody don't talk loud enough we can run it through those little speakers right there why not i don't need it somebody else does he knows how to do it don't spot sure he does yeah you can run it through i mean you know how to do that you just turn these speakers on and turn them up and your voice will go good okay okay cool all right patience we're talking about patient but uh like i said we i was kind of meditating yesterday on uh on thoughts so let's get through here second peter 1 3 according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this in other words besides your new birth right well that's what it says having the divine nature so besides having a new birth giving all diligence add these things to your new birth all right add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience we've already been through those into patience godliness now we'll stop there and we're talking about patience and the bible says in patience possess you your soul and we'll read in just a few minutes but remember the word patient means enduring perseverance in other words it's not something that's going to come quickly it's something that's going to come over time and god's going to test us and test us and test us but how is he going to test us he's going to test us through the devil or through his little minions or through his little i was thinking yesterday i thought and this is no this this should not be something that we talk about in the message but you know to be an overcomer brother brown said coming to church you're an overcomer so if you don't come to church you're not an overcomer he said well i'm going to stay home and watch because i because i had a long day you're not an overcomer an overcomer is somebody to those that overcome in the book of revelation that's one thing about in the book of revelations to those that overcome your give these but if you're but not if you're not you're not going to get that right you say well i can overcome at home say no no you can't overcome at home you overcome by the things you overcome to get here i don't have no gas money ain't got no time i ain't got this right now the bible didn't stipulate did it it says for satan not to assembling yourself together and the bible says and more as you see the day approaching the problem is a lot of y'all and people in the message must not see the day approaching because do you come to church more than you used to if you don't you're part of that group i'm sorry but to overcome overcoming means you get here and you persevere that's what we're talking about patience we're persevering oh i can't do this look at bob he works till five o'clock in the afternoon in downtown atlanta now if anybody's got an excuse he does and sometimes maybe the things don't run right and and all that but i'm talking about sometimes i'm talking about i ain't talking about something i'm coming all the time see we got you know people can't make it on wednesday night why i got work i got bob comes from downtown atlanta at five o'clock gets on a bus rides it to marta gets on the marta bus meets monica somewhere at the marta station she fixes his lunch or supper he eats it on the way up here see that's overcoming you know what god's gonna bless him but some of you live eight and ten miles from here can't get a church on wednesday night what's your problem what's your problem sorry come on sunday morning we got people to get filled up on sunday morning now they just become denominational message believers sorry because the bible says impatience possess you your soul impatience right that's right impatience bob is patient because he knows at five o'clock he's going to get off he's not going to be nervous about it sure he wants to try to get to church but remember brother brown i'm told that guy said he said you had a i saw you had a real rough time getting to service do you have a fight from a time and the guy said i just got in the car and come to church but it was all the external things that maybe the guy had to handle before he went out the door or the devils that was trying to you know do this or do that i've always said that that we must prepare perseverance means to if i got to get him go to work every morning as far as i know i've never been late for work because i get up before i'm supposed to get up but i see that and you say well that's not your nature no i had to train myself to do that i had to be an overcomer on saturday sometimes i sleep till eight o'clock and that to me that's a wasted day isn't it jim tell them i mean i'm uh way before she gets up or stirs or whatever but that's okay she needs her rest for dealing with me all week so that's a rest time but impatience possess you your soul so you've got to do it you've got to decide i don't care how i feel i'm coming to church i don't care if i don't have enough gas money god will provide gas money that's right but you know what he's not he's not obligated for you to sit home and worry about the gas money get up and do something get up and go get up and yeah hey how many of you really felt like getting up and coming to church this morning one or two or three but not everybody how you gonna overcome you overcame something by getting up and coming to church and you've dedicated this day to the lord i hope you do that i hope you dedicate this day to the lord not that you just gotta come to church because brother dale's gonna tell you if you don't come to church you're going to hell right that's right you understand what i mean and brother i'm not going to tell you that but that love letter between the lines will tell you if you don't come to church what are you you're not patient you're not persevering that's word here sustaining i come to church every wednesday night how many of you know i missed one in 14 years one wednesday night something happened at work and i had to leave and go and i couldn't didn't get here but you know what i came here after i got finished one sunday morning i didn't get here to a service starting that's two times in 15 years now that that's life stuff's going to happen in life two times in 15 years but 15 times in a month we got a problem right 15 times in a month we got a problem oh yeah but look if we don't have these virtues you're not going to take a body change and it starts with the simplicity of being born again and persevering persevering be of a long spirit and i haven't read some of these be of a long spirit not to lose heart that's our problem we lose heart we we by tuesday we say you start preparing not to come on wednesday why you lose heart you you don't listen you don't believe god's going to meet you how many times have i told you i've been preaching i said look god tells you when he's going to be here he's going to be here at 10 and at 2 on sunday he's going to be here at 7 00 on wednesday night remember what he said we're two or three or gathered in my name there i'll be in the midst so you know god's going to be here if there's two or three people here if you miss that you've missed the visitation of god that's how i feel about church and i'm not dog and i am dogmatic about going to church christians don't brother brown said christians go to church can't wait for the doors to open to get to church all right and i know there's life and i know this thing's happening i'm talking about it in the long run have long patience bear long suffer long be long suffering patiently endure to persevere patiently and bravely in enduring misfortunes and troubles that's how your patience is going to be tried right that you don't have gas money to get here that your car won't work or you got to get another car or or you did have to work till 5 15 instead of 5 o'clock and you got to rush to get here and i know some people say well i had such a bad spirit i didn't want to come to church now you're going to take that bad spirit home with you and you're going to sleep with it this is where you're going to get delivered from that bad amen that's right i'm going to preach this morning amen this is where you get rid of that stuff you get rid of that bad spirit here if you get a bad spirit say well i'm not coming to church guess what that bad spirit guess what it's done that's right i've done my job and satan gives him a flame of fire or some coal or something i don't know give him something to persevere patiently be patient and burying the offenses and injuries of others to be mild and slow to punish now let's go to luke 24 let's read some of these scriptures again because there's one i want to talk on this morning besides the one that says in your patience possess you your soul now listen your soul is what we're talking about right it starts in the soul if the soul has a desire the body's going to walk right into that desire is that correct all right luke 21 17. sorry i didn't have it up on the screen y'all have to do the old-fashioned way luke 21-17 21-17 and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but there shall not a hair of your head perish in your patience possess you your soul all right in your patience patience is very important therefore be romans 5. now let's go to romans 5 1. we're going to talk about one here but probably stop in just a minute talk about it all right but think about that over go read those overcomers i'm i'm working on something in my head i haven't got it on paper yet with these overcomings tied to the statue of a perfect man and tied to the seal so remember there's eight overcomings did everybody know that he said now there's only seven church agents go to revelations 21. there's one more he that'll overcome it because that says all things all right okay so we're in revelations when the city comes down you know john sees the holy city and everything's done and locked in and he says to them that overcome us number eight there's seven in the church ages but there's one more just saying here one two three four five six seven eight that's eight overcomings right there faith virtue faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and love that's eight hates the number of what eternity all right so we are we are creatures if you were in a bible study last night i hope you understood what we were talking about there is a there's not a difference but there's a difference between this church age and all the other churches yes okay all the other church ages had the holy ghost they had the token they have the new bark they had some of these virtues working in their life but when brother brown says the end time message is a token and the token only came in the end time a lot of people think well nobody had a new birth from now no it's just that we have the fullness of the new birth so brother branham come brother brown never came on this earth to change the new birth you get the new birth the same way martin luther got the new birth yes brother brown didn't come to change the new birth he didn't come to change the bible right but he came to take what was laying on that pages of the bible that martin luther read many times probably in in peter about add to your faith virtue and all his temper but see it didn't it it didn't come alive to him it wasn't quitting to him or he wouldn't smoke a pot and drink a beer in a pub but the just shall live by faith is what god wanted for that time that's what the people could understand for that time so now here we are to where the brotherhood says the token only came in the end time the token to get us the body chain that's right to get us out of here the full course meal which is eight manifestations of god like brother dale and and i've been preached for many many years on the eight manifestations of god and you know what i that's a a pretty popular sermon that i preach out in the out in when i go preach and and a lot of people understand it a lot of people don't but uh i've been speaking on it for years but if you don't see the eight manifestations of god then you will die and go by the grave because seven is completion but seven is not eternity seven you're still in time time doesn't take a rapture eternity takes a rapture so we have to have the eight manifestations of god here working in our life before we take a body change all right so romans five verse one so when we uh when brother dale preaches he preaches two levels everybody needs the new birth we got young people everybody needs a new birth so the new birth has got to be prevalent on your mind but the ones that have the new birth need to add to add two what you already have add two everybody understand what i'm saying brother brown's the same way he'll tell you he'll say he'll say luther had a dip of the holy ghost well hey then he goes to the not at that time but he goes to another illustration and he says if you take a dip out of the ocean it's a very minute piece of the ocean a teaspoon out of billions and billions of gallons but it has the same substance that's right of the ocean so if you've got a teaspoon of the new birth or a spot of the new birth it's the same new birth they come on the day of pentecost okay now you have to understand the day of pentecost there was two comings of the new birth 120 in the upper room had been tutored by jesus he was the word he he spoke the word to him they remembered what he said they took what he said so peter could say add to your faith virtue but now when peter goes outside and speaks to the 3000 downstairs they're just babies that's right they're just going what must be do we do to be saved peter said repent that's right and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and the bible says three thousand souls were added well they didn't have virtue knowledge temperatures godless brother and kindness they were beginning to develop into that but they didn't have it like the 120 in the upper room because the 120th like i said had been tutored by the word himself so that's you and i we become babies downstairs down at the bottom the 3000 that's how we all started right because we only get birth by the word that we hear that's why i said these ads are a birth as you hear more of word you get more virtue as you hear more word you get more knowledge you get more temperaments you get more patience um we read the scripture i think last night about the young sister but there's a there's a i was reading somewhere i believe it was in galatians or philippians or timothy or somewhere where he's talking about the bishop people like that he's talking about the younger ones don't don't give the word to a novice in other words don't don't don't don't take a deacon that's uh say that brother danny just been born again a week ago and he's excited and he's got you know he gets born again but don't make him a deacon yet right he's not seasoned he's got to be seasoned a little bit he you know after about three or four years you have to judge that well see that's why god same way with patience we must have patients even with the babbling babies babies make mistakes babies fall but listen everybody sitting in this room right here ain't babies that's right you've been in this thing a while so if you make a mistake there's two things you either lost or you backslid one to two okay okay that's right you be born again and be backslidden don't let that bother you you can because brother brown said we backslide every day and i ask god every night i said god forgive me for backsliding and i don't exactly say backsliding sometimes but forgive me for for the things i do against you because just being this is contrary to god that's right i mean i don't apologize for being human he knows that but i apologize for my human ways that my reactions and my actions and reactions so we're not going to get finished with this romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god now peace is patience peace is patience okay you understand that that's what peace is patience if you're all jittery and nervous now is that peaceful no peaceful is knowing that like when god shows you something like dad did about me or dad did about the other night you know he talked last night about that scripture in in deuteronomy once you get a revelation and once that cog kind of clicks over into that place well that's not a devil in hell gonna drive you away from it now they're gonna come and try to that's right punch that but when you have peace that means you got patience okay these peace accords and he's trying to get peace what was jimmy carter trying to do he's trying to get look be patient be patient with each other let's come together and shake i know we've got differences but let's shake that's peace so watch therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith bottom of the pyramid into this grace wherein we stand a statue of a perfect man and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only also but with glory and tribulation also good side bad side it's going to be tribulation but watch knowing the tribulation work at patience all right and patience experience and experience hope look at the three things patience experience and hope all right so now let's go to hebrews 6. because i want to get to something here hebrews 6 11. and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence and what patience diligence what is diligence going to the end be diligent to the full assurance of hope and to the end they be not slow for just what i was talking about but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise and joshua had a promise he said cross jordan god did and said possess the land now joshua didn't just walk over jordan and people just fell over dead he fought for every inch of ground that's right now sure he didn't lose the man until then came into camp but still he had five that's right he had to prepare his army he had put him in position he had to say go get these ice go get this side go get that ice all right so you and i have a have a uh a part to play in this through patience inherit the promises for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiply and i'll multiply thee so after after he had patiently endured now god knew what he was going to do god had already given the promise remember i told him that brother gerald's last weekend this is not written for god he knows what's going to happen this is written for our admonition because we don't know what tomorrow's going to be so this is not pulling anything over on god this is not some new thing to god he wrote this before the foundation of the world amen he always had it here he was just waiting for us to develop patience next sunday so we got this yes sir thank you thanks for reminding me we're going to be a brother bill johnson sunday morning we'll be preaching for him up there so just keep receiving prayers i forgot we're gonna ministers meeting saturday and then he asked me to stay on what's a big sunday so keep me in the pressure that should be not slow fall drag the church well you will but followers of them who through faith and patience inherits promise when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater swear by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiply i'll multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise patiently endured he received a promise right let's go to let's go to james let's turn it over to james that's the one i want to get to james five right here real quick okay james five and seven that's right before uh jude and revelations there you know i said most of our if you'll if you'll look back brother branham makes most of his comments on temperance and patience he'll say see we've already got this far and we're falling off or see we do this or see we did that or we temperance and patience are the two things that he really said we needed and i believe temp like i said i told y'all temperance and patience goes together and if you don't have them listen if you don't have them you're not going to take a body change can i say that one more time so these are requirements these are half twos not i can skip these right these are half tooth that's right sorry if you want to be born again bob did a great job last sunday yes yeah the kingdom of god is taken by force you got to fight your way into this thing and you know what when you get born again you don't lay a sword down god just gives you more armor that's right so he wants you to fight more than you are right right remember you get a helmet of salvation and shot with the shoes of preparation and shield of faith and he puts everything on you then when you get the new birth if you we think we get the new birth and man we we walk around and we walk around in in sil you know we're fine don't bother us no god keeps he puts put your armor on you that's right you don't take it off of you all right and we're going to need it until we get over there all right be patient therefore brethren well right there he starts be patient unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth in other words he's waiting on us who's the husbandman christ right right watch the fruit of the earth us um so christ is waiting on us that's right and have long patience for it until receive the early and latter rain now what's the form of rain what's the latter rain harvest all right former is teaching or planting the latter rain is the rain in october before the harvest time comes all right you have a plant man and a harvest moon and all things work together in nature but it's also the same way with you and i right but look have long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain there's a promise to you that if you're patient you're going to see you're going to get the word sewn down but it's not going to be that the word's just sewn down he's going to harvest what's in your field now the harvest is what the rapture is right but you only rapture or you only harvest mature grain like dad's been preaching to the the corn of wheat or or the wheat comes up like this you go out to your garden and you say man i got i got wheat let's just go and harvest it no you're going to get just two little wilted leaves then you get a stock that comes up well boy there it is no that's not there yet but it is got life in it that's right it has the life in it right but when that thing comes out to the grain and you see the grain you say oh that's the grain no that's not the grain that's the shot okay all right that's the shuck got life in it because what's inside of that is it's nurturing what's inside of it then the shuck pulls away and there's your grain again well now that grain's got to dry it's got to lay before the presence of the sun you've got to have patience but right here at this to me this is a this is the promise until he received the former and latter rain let me say it that way or the teaching rain or the sowing of the rent or the sowing rain or and the harvest rain so this patience is going to carry us from our new birth right to our body change or to the rapture be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nine now that was two thousand years ago how much more now is the lord drawing now so like i said for saying not assembling yourself together and much more as you see the day approaches some people just can't see that they approach them be ye also patient establish your hearts in other words grounded settled don't be swept away in other words by every wind or doctrine for the coming of the lord draweth now grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned behold with judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and a patience look at isaiah isaiah was a young man he was a prophet what happened to isaiah they took him out and saw the dude to pieces saw him while he was alive saw him in two look at all the other ones that were stoned even jesus said you you stoned the prophets and you you in other words you you clean the tombs and you garnish the tombs of the prophets and you're the one to put them in there don't let that happen to us right we don't the physical killing parts over i think i hope we're not murderers but you can murder somebody with your actions in your mouth thank my brother and the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience now look they had patience but they didn't have new birth patients they didn't have any birth they could have new birth patients they had an anointing patients right which was temporary we count them happy which endure like i told you before to have happiness you got to have song sorrow is a part of happiness right you got to be in one position to be real happy when you get to this position or you're a bunch listen we're spoiled brats if we do if if we do that if god just pours everything on us all the time all right yes yes yes yes yes yes no sometimes he says no and remember his nose were better than all of our yeses behold we count them happy which endure now do we believe the bible or not you have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy we've got to start believing this yes that the trial of our faith which is much more precious than gold this world runs by gold right yes but the trial of your faith if we believe the bible is much more precious than that goal and it said that perishes because your faith is not going to perish we'll walk on the streets of gold gold's not going to mean nothing to us we're not going to need gold to run the economy you know who we're going to need to run the economy us that's right people in the city because i believe outside the city they're going to plant they're going to grow and they're going to harvest and they're going to do this and they're going to do that and i think i might brother clog they're going to bring a tenth of their tithe in and bring it into us and we're going to eat it a scripture in it we're the levitical priests we're the priesthood right we're the kings and priests the ones outside are going to harvest and bring us attempt of everything in and you know what you don't worry about getting hungry because there's going to be billions more outside the city than they are inside we're probably going to have to rebuild the town to get all the stuff in it and i'm just making a point but don't worry about that but i do believe that that we've come to a position that we don't we're not seeing the position that god wants us to be in if and i'll get back to it in my last part i think of of the genesis 1 26 man that's okay baby he's all right i lost my thoughts somebody say something this is 126 man and the part that if adam had this working the whole genesis 126 because that was ma that was man not mankind you understand that's when you borrow it but all those characteristics that i was speaking about in the first part about having the replenishing and multiplying all those things we got to come back to that while we're here that's right adam's got to come back in power here not in the millennium now that's how we're going to make it out of here we may have to speak a storm out of existence we may have to speak a car off the road we may have to speak a car to get to church but if you don't have it you're going to sit home and die not physically but spiritually you're going to sit home and die all right let's go we'll see you in two weeks sir bob be next sunday and ryan you got the next one coming up
