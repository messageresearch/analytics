[18:14] thank you for your loving your grace in

[18:22] go start with about verse 6
[18:28] and the Sabbath of the land shall be
[18:32] meat for you for thee and for thy
[18:34] servant for thy maid for the hard
[18:37] servant for the stranger that sojourneth
[18:39] with thee now remember the rest for the
[18:42] land the land gets the rest and all like
[18:45] that remember that part okay but then it
[18:48] goes into the human part all right so
[18:50] you take from the land to to do in the
[18:53] next is what animals culture and for thy
[18:55] cattle and for the beasts that are in
[18:57] thy land shall all the increase there
[19:00] will be meat and thy throat number seven
[19:03] Sabbath's of years under these seven
[19:05] times seven years and the space of the
[19:08] seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto
[19:10] the forty and nine years
[19:12] then shalt thou caused the trumpet of
[19:15] the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of
[19:17] the seventh month in the day of the
[19:20] atonement so you make the trumpet sound
[19:22] throughout all your land and you shall
[19:24] hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim
[19:27] liberty throughout all the land unto all
[19:30] the inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[19:33] jubilee unto you and you shall return
[19:34] every man unto his possession and you
[19:37] shall return every man unto his family
[19:40] you may be seated
[19:41] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[19:44] the word now I got I don't know what you
[19:50] called it I got I don't get nervous
[19:53] preaching I get to a point trying to
[19:56] bring something out and that makes me
[19:58] speed up and I was going to let it go
[20:02] and you know but I think we need to make
[20:04] sure that we understand the scriptures
[20:07] about things because that way it's not
[20:10] just taking what somebody says is taking
[20:14] what the scriptures are actually saying
[20:16] and letting it be the answer to it more
[20:20] than just to be you know a point that we
[20:24] we look at and I hope he was following
[20:28] my point I've tried to make it over and
[20:30] over and over we know that there's a
[20:34] Sabbath ever seven years there was a
[20:36] release every seven years all right now
[20:39] then it would go seven times seven
[20:42] and it would come up to 49 that's an
[20:45] automatic doing all right and see then
[20:49] something was to take place in each
[20:54] church age because the seven church the
[20:58] the seven sabbaths is top of the seven
[21:00] search ages as Feast of the trumpets
[21:02] paragraph two to 38 28 right and there
[21:10] was supposed to be a time tire of a
[21:14] release and it would come all the way
[21:15] and come to the seven churches that's
[21:17] what I want to hold that point because I
[21:20] want you to see it because to me it's
[21:22] marvelous to think about how perfect the
[21:26] scripture goes one two three four five
[21:29] six seven like that it comes it comes
[21:32] out perfect if we follow the taller the
[21:35] lineup and don't get our ideas and you
[21:38] know get to thinking on something and
[21:39] take it for what it's saying all right
[21:42] it had a jubilee ever seven years all
[21:48] right
[21:48] you work six years for somebody for your
[21:51] debts if you sold yourself into bondage
[21:54] to him as a slave as the Prophet would
[21:57] call it but it's a brother to a brother
[22:00] it's a Hebrew to a Hebrew and then when
[22:03] it does is it's when you go free there
[22:07] was a freedom ever seven years in the
[22:11] Bible time that would type then the
[22:14] seven churches so it would show you the
[22:16] seven churches is gonna have a freedom
[22:18] there was a freedom as I was trying to
[22:20] say this morning in each church age a
[22:22] release was in each church age whether
[22:25] it be Luther's justification
[22:27] Wesley's sanctification the baptism of
[22:30] the Holy Ghost under Azusa Street it was
[22:33] a release it was the time to let man go
[22:37] free
[22:38] Linna but it stayed in a seven and
[22:42] remember this as long as you're in a
[22:46] number seven
[22:48] that's where we'll get to it later I
[22:50] meant to go into this evening but take
[22:53] me too long so I need to cover this
[22:56] because it take me too long to try to
[22:58] maybe next Sunday just take both
[23:01] services and try to speak about and if I
[23:04] would if you would between now and then
[23:07] to read the message called the future
[23:09] home of the heavenly bridegroom in the
[23:13] earthly bride all right and that you'd
[23:15] pay close attention to the statements
[23:18] that brother Branham makes about the
[23:22] seven and it represents the Millennium
[23:24] alright because it's the seventh day out
[23:27] of Eden but then he starts talking about
[23:31] something that mankind had never hardly
[23:34] I don't know of any doing it and
[23:37] teaching it that way but you know breaks
[23:40] it to a number eight and he actually
[23:44] says now I brought a random you're
[23:46] trying to put something beyond the seven
[23:49] well now listen to what I'm saying
[23:52] Church you say well if we understood
[23:55] this we we are you saying we don't want
[24:00] your prophet said there was something
[24:04] beyond the seven and nobody knew
[24:07] anything about it now there may have
[24:11] been people who picked up things and
[24:13] preached them and read it and things
[24:15] like that of the number seven Scofield
[24:18] mentions a lot of the things about it
[24:20] but they had no comprehension you didn't
[24:24] hear him preaching of a future home you
[24:27] didn't do it here I'm in the Book of
[24:29] Revelations trying to explain it because
[24:31] they didn't understand it that was we
[24:33] didn't have no comprehension see it took
[24:36] a prophet and I'm saying this it took a
[24:39] prophet that had spent almost three
[24:41] years in bringing his own message as I
[24:44] was trying to explain this morning
[24:45] co-brother honest message started right
[24:48] there right before the opening of the
[24:50] seals he's the one that said these
[24:52] things you'll find it in the rapture and
[24:54] things like that not in the years of
[24:56] preparation but when he begins to sound
[24:58] you said what was he doing before he was
[25:01] doing the work
[25:02] restoration back to the faith of the
[25:06] fathers because that was the to part off
[25:09] 327 Church age book 1 turn the hearts of
[25:12] the children back the faith if I to
[25:15] reveal de Thunder switches revelation
[25:17] contained in the seven seals we see his
[25:19] message didn't begin until bringing this
[25:22] the seals into view because his message
[25:25] was not just a message of of a release
[25:30] at the end I was trying to explain it
[25:32] and I know I mess up a lot trying to get
[25:35] you to see it but this message was the
[25:37] message of eternal life there's never
[25:40] been anybody taught it like the Prophet
[25:43] taught it now you know that's true I
[25:46] mean there's no church taught it no
[25:49] denominations taught it nobody told us
[25:51] about these things I'm telling you
[25:53] honestly come on somebody might have
[25:55] preached a message on it that's what
[25:57] gets me you say this you say well so and
[26:00] so it's wrong nobody's ever I heard that
[26:03] well it might mean one time they heard
[26:06] it or one message or whatever I mean for
[26:08] a doctrinal issues and things
[26:11] nobody knew those things it took a
[26:15] prophet all right now then in doing that
[26:18] if you watch what he's doing then watch
[26:20] what I said he's he's bringing a to part
[26:23] of the message
[26:25] he tried to preach the seals back in and
[26:28] he preached him entitled it to seals in
[26:30] wala 55 55 56 somewhere out at night but
[26:35] then the seals broke to him in 63 all
[26:39] right see then that was his message to
[26:42] bring those years in before were in
[26:45] preparation just like I was trying to
[26:47] explain each church age had a messenger
[26:53] and a message to bring to that age all
[26:57] right and that was the only way you
[26:59] could be in the right of that age was to
[27:05] follow the message of that age and the
[27:08] messenger in his ministry all right
[27:11] because that was God's Way of doing it
[27:13] but see then none of those ages went to
[27:17] a completion to where that you could
[27:19] totally go for 8 they kept being a
[27:22] little scruples little problems and run
[27:25] around and said this messenger come to
[27:26] straighten out all the screws he said he
[27:29] didn't have no message of his own you
[27:30] remember that we said he was to take all
[27:32] the loose ends and time together all
[27:38] right
[27:38] see there was loose ends he said on that
[27:40] seal book he said there's a mysterious
[27:43] part of justification a mysterious part
[27:46] of sanctification a mysterious part of
[27:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:50] there wasn't understood by man you mean
[27:53] Paul didn't understand just K same came
[27:55] back Peter no he's not talking like that
[27:58] he's telling you there was something to
[28:01] her that was those seals would open up
[28:05] to bring into view we see each church
[28:09] age and I tried to explain see then they
[28:11] would have a release
[28:14] but nobody took a rapture nobody took a
[28:17] change of the body
[28:18] everybody had to die and go by the grave
[28:21] so then number one number two whatever
[28:25] you read it wouldn't work but when you
[28:28] come to the seventh one you might not
[28:32] have understood that part maybe I need
[28:33] to spend a lengthy time on it I've done
[28:36] it before but there is seven church age
[28:41] angels but there's eight manifestations
[28:44] of God in the church ages I read it to
[28:48] you where the Holy Ghost came himself or
[28:53] huh he was the messenger to the lady of
[28:56] C&H was the Holy Ghost
[28:58] then the Prophet comes at the end of the
[29:01] age
[29:03] if you'd understand when he comes to do
[29:06] and compare it with what we're gonna
[29:08] read in Leviticus the word that that
[29:11] priest rides through the land and tells
[29:14] everybody the freedom is to come you
[29:19] couldn't just throw you ho down and walk
[29:21] off you had to wait till a certain time
[29:25] and that priest had to declare it the
[29:28] gospel trumpet is what tells you you're
[29:30] free
[29:32] so his church age messenger was bringing
[29:35] the gospel trumpet between you come up
[29:38] to the seventh one and it's a marvelous
[29:40] situation the Holy Ghost comes to make
[29:44] way for the Prophet would you agree to
[29:47] that he comes to make way for the
[29:50] Prophet to come on this thing all right
[29:52] then when the Prophet comes the Holy
[29:55] Ghost enters the Prophet to bring the
[29:57] message we'll get to it next week and
[30:02] they hit it just a little bit right at
[30:05] the end this morning on this evening but
[30:08] you know yourself that people are tied
[30:11] up into what a little bit I tried to
[30:13] explain oh how that thing's he comes in
[30:17] three and sons nine so the man of God
[30:21] son of David where would you be without
[30:26] a profit organization people are our
[30:30] ideas and thoughts after hearing a
[30:31] little bit they could express that and
[30:33] understand it but where have you ever
[30:37] tried to hear it explained you know that
[30:41] right in between he says between that
[30:44] son of God and Son of David he comes
[30:47] back at son of man now that would have
[30:51] to be in one man to start with the
[30:56] messenger of the age all right but then
[31:00] it has to go on over into the people
[31:02] because they're got to receive the
[31:03] freedom that's all right yeah see then
[31:06] if you're following what I'm saying
[31:09] to the bride of each age had a release
[31:14] we read you the scriptures to where
[31:17] there was the limitations on the seven
[31:20] you go into bondage with a wife you come
[31:26] out with your wife if your master gave
[31:28] you why the wife in the children stayed
[31:31] you know with the with a master I've
[31:37] tried to be even sensible about things
[31:41] that you think I'm not you think I'm
[31:42] hard but you know what I tried to
[31:47] explain a brother to a brother and
[31:48] freedom when that brother would let you
[31:51] go free it didn't make no difference
[31:53] what you owed because it was the law of
[31:57] God it was the Word of God they were
[32:00] keeping and God would bless that person
[32:03] they said I go into bondage brother
[32:06] Colley cause oh and money will see God
[32:09] for me in him for me to keep my part of
[32:11] the word and work hard and try to do
[32:14] everything and for him to keep his part
[32:17] of letting me go free God's gonna bless
[32:20] that cause it's God's Word a blessing is
[32:26] there for those thing why because he's
[32:28] speaking of salvation all right speaking
[32:34] of a time that would come that there
[32:36] would be a real rest that Jesus spoke of
[32:39] all right and see when he come he had
[32:43] his rest
[32:45] to speak of just as any other but his
[32:48] rest and he spoke up was he turn alive
[32:52] that's what Jesus was speaking of when
[32:55] he said coming to me are you labor and
[32:56] heavy laden and I'll give you eternal
[32:58] life I'll give you rest well huh because
[33:02] that was to be what it would would come
[33:04] out into finally in to the ages you know
[33:07] to be the right thing okay then that
[33:14] seventh you went six you know Dave's
[33:18] that seventh year the sabbatical that
[33:22] would come to work that you would be
[33:25] speaking in the seventh think about that
[33:27] messenger he rides through the land
[33:31] telling the people they can go free at a
[33:33] certain date he doesn't go through
[33:36] necessarily and say you're free you're
[33:38] free you're free throw down your home go
[33:40] home go you don't know nobody know
[33:41] you've got to know he it's the Holy
[33:43] Ghost
[33:44] whatever that God wants me to do I must
[33:49] stay and work for brother Colley until
[33:52] my pay is done or my time is up when God
[33:57] would establish my time
[33:58] I don't quit ahead of time saying bless
[34:00] god I'm leaving no you don't do that
[34:04] this is all speaking of salvation and
[34:08] speaking of it remember if you're going
[34:10] to bondage with a wife you come out with
[34:11] but it's from your master give your wife
[34:14] and she has job they're supposed to
[34:16] study
[34:18] the church case you see something from
[34:20] one time about salvation in the Old
[34:23] Testament I'm just I'm serious I know I
[34:27] say thanks funny and I like that but do
[34:33] you think nice I'll go work for brother
[34:36] Colley I spend my time I work for it
[34:39] okay he tells me said all right you can
[34:42] go free and we went through and
[34:45] explained what the Bible says he's
[34:48] supposed to give me enough to take care
[34:53] of me to get me started right
[34:58] wouldn't do you think he's going to keep
[35:01] my wife I'm just serious sure I think
[35:06] about salvation maybe a little different
[35:09] you did I don't see that brother Colley
[35:12] would keep my wife even though he gave
[35:14] it to me and had a right to he's my
[35:18] brother he wouldn't keep it bless God
[35:22] I'm gonna keep her I'm gonna keep her
[35:24] children he'd have a right to because
[35:27] the law said it what do you think he'd
[35:29] do it would you do it
[35:37] you know no you would you would say okay
[35:41] you take your wife and children and go
[35:43] home
[35:43] we're all brothers it to be no poor in
[35:46] the land the Bible says that's what I
[35:49] love about it God takes care of he made
[35:52] a way for everything all right we see
[35:55] when that lies we're not 7th aids or
[35:58] seventh feast I'm Jubilee would come
[36:02] it's very special but I said you can
[36:06] argue back to back you can argue all you
[36:08] want to about how you get to the 50 the
[36:12] only thing I've ever said and talk it's
[36:14] one time they will one day have to
[36:17] become a literal 50 that will be your
[36:23] future home the eighth day so to say
[36:28] there's never going to be a fifty you're
[36:30] wrong what to say well this is a 50
[36:33] you'll be wrong the best thing to do is
[36:36] just let it go and think about it as
[36:39] that messenger would ride through the
[36:41] land telling everybody that could go for
[36:44] me if you think about brother Branham
[36:48] circling the world seven times going
[36:51] about and declaring freedom was anybody
[36:54] ever preached freedom like he did no you
[36:59] know better than that
[37:00] nobody ever know anything about freedom
[37:02] like he did
[37:05] let's see freedom to us is like we think
[37:08] about getting everything gift to us free
[37:10] of charge
[37:13] that's not free to me there well I don't
[37:18] have to go in bondage to him
[37:19] ask my brother that's not freedom see we
[37:24] make our own stipulations and points and
[37:26] we wind up listen what I'm talking about
[37:34] in plain language when your prophet
[37:39] brought his message the first time of
[37:43] mankind that ever had the ability to
[37:47] receive from God
[37:50] not brother branham them from God that
[37:54] you believed that we needed the message
[37:58] we needed this message is your release
[38:04] it will either bind you or loose you
[38:08] that's according what you do with it you
[38:12] can make it a book a rules you can make
[38:14] it all kind of things but it's not a
[38:18] book of rules this message is the
[38:22] revelation of Jesus Christ no shadow
[38:28] brother branham and having to preach to
[38:29] a world of different people than
[38:31] everything but what did he make a
[38:32] statement one time he said you don't
[38:39] have to tell the Holy Ghost feel woman
[38:41] it's wrong to wear pants
[38:48] that's what he said
[38:52] you know you know how to tell nobody's
[38:54] wrong no woman that's wrong cut her
[38:56] higher if she's ever read the Bible when
[39:02] she ain't never read the Bible I don't
[39:07] understand I don't know why a lot of
[39:09] things happens in life but my wife she
[39:13] Ward this very little lipstick or
[39:15] whatever this that was there this small
[39:17] and that was gone in a hurry but you
[39:20] know what I always wanted her to have
[39:21] long hair because I'm old school I'm old
[39:27] school that a woman's supposed to look
[39:28] like a woman and a man supposed to look
[39:30] like a man and I even tell it but not
[39:34] for the degrading but telling it for the
[39:37] truth the girls that were wrong living
[39:40] prostitutes as we call them red light
[39:42] things in my day had long hair why
[39:47] because they knew what a woman's
[39:49] supposed to look like right I mean you
[39:55] go walking in Walmart and there's a
[39:57] little divider then you look up there
[40:01] and here's one wall this way the one
[40:03] wall that way with a door well you know
[40:06] I don't have to be able to read
[40:09] they're still doing that at least
[40:12] they're trying to change all that
[40:14] but you don't have to walk over my
[40:17] eyesight is getting so bad I can't make
[40:19] out that little letter does that say men
[40:24] you understand welcoming that I look at
[40:28] the Sun the sun's got a dress on it I
[40:32] know which bathroom to go into without
[40:34] having the ability to read I thought we
[40:39] were Christians brother Adam never had
[40:42] to come to tell us to get rid of you
[40:46] didn't have to tell me to quit drinking
[40:49] that's what people are saying boy when I
[40:51] come in this message man I was s nothing
[40:53] and I quit that drinking I quit that
[40:55] smoking I quit that chew and I didn't do
[40:58] it was I saved all the time I know a
[41:02] wooden we got no arguments there I know

[41:10] Dakota I don't drink I don't smoke I
[41:11] don't you try must be saved
[41:15] see that ain't even a good old testing
[41:17] with Christian little only knew he said
[41:22] whoa okay I'm just trying to explain
[41:25] what this prophet done you think about
[41:27] how hard he had to preach and wouldn't
[41:31] it wouldn't it a shame what he would say
[41:34] he said I come back every year
[41:37] Tabernacle now I come back every year
[41:41] and finds you going worse and worse and
[41:43] worse

[42:02] I'm at the Tabernacle just a hollering
[42:03] and screaming that run around I'm
[42:04] talking about some and they're the ones
[42:07] he's talking about
[42:11] right and then see he really was a
[42:18] prophet but see he had a message the
[42:23] message is what I'm getting at people is
[42:26] not concerned about the message they're
[42:27] concerned about some kind of this that
[42:29] or the other it's the message your
[42:33] prophet brought a message that will take
[42:37] us to the change that's what I've tried
[42:41] to get you to say take us to the change
[42:43] of the body this message will if you
[42:48] just follow it it's not a book of rules
[42:53] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ what I
[43:00] said you say yeah when I heard the
[43:03] product I quit this not quit that
[43:04] well what about some of us that never
[43:06] done it well you're just the oddball

[44:06] message just a book of rules rules will
[44:11] never change anything
[44:14] you will always repel against rules you

[45:41] down and say downwards supposed to be up
[45:42] and it's just getting old but at least I
[45:45] still got so that's one thing about all
[45:48] right get off but now listen see the
[45:53] message I was talking about this morning
[45:55] they've been talking about the message
[45:58] brother Branham was too brain was to not
[46:02] just bring us a seven-year Liberty you
[46:05] know one over seven years because
[46:08] there's limitations in all of those
[46:10] seven years
[46:14] there's limitations in that well you go
[46:19] into bondage with a wife you come out
[46:20] you're going to bunny throughout and man
[46:22] give you a while you come out and wife
[46:24] stays and bondage that's the laws and
[46:27] the things there's limitations now I
[46:31] want to get to where they ain't no limit
[46:32] but to show you that it's not so perfect
[46:37] the Bible tells you and the Prophet says
[46:41] when the man goes out he goes out owing
[46:44] nothing I oh brother Kali a million
[46:50] dollars I pay him back for so many years
[46:53] working they need enough to start a down
[46:57] payment on paying him back when he can't
[46:59] hold that against me he lets me go free
[47:02] cuz that's a brother to a brother you
[47:05] say that's no that's not loose living
[47:07] that's the truth that's what God said
[47:09] for us to do and see then when you come
[47:15] down to it this life stage this
[47:21] messenger of this life stage the Holy
[47:24] Ghost at the turn of the century leading
[47:27] the messenger to the age I read it to
[47:29] you this morning when the messenger
[47:32] comes at the end of the age there's many
[47:36] times as brother Brennan said that like
[47:37] I told you we said in talking one day
[47:39] and his this minister said I just
[47:43] sitting there outside of him and I know
[47:44] he listened to my tapes because he told
[47:46] me did
[47:47] and he punished this other and said
[47:50] that's where they get all of this mess
[47:51] and you're coming at the end of the age
[47:52] oh brother why didn't you say something
[47:56] Oh same thing to it if that's all he
[47:59] knows that's all you know who forget it
[48:01] ain't gonna argue we just gotta walk off
[48:08] this mortises he studied the message
[48:12] it's kind of like that
[48:14] I remember one the Martin boy said it
[48:16] it's lady told him something and he said
[48:20] my lord sister he said that ain't even
[48:23] in the Bible she said well you ought to
[48:26] know it's in there somewhere
[48:27] cause you the preacher preacher can't
[48:31] put it in there
[48:31] you might have you find it but listen
[48:37] see then this life stage this message is
[48:42] so marvelous until it spoke of
[48:45] throughout the Word of God this message
[48:50] is this time and it's doing all right
[48:52] let's do that for just a little bit to
[48:54] see then we've got a communion go ahead
[48:57] with number six cause we're right back
[48:59] where we started with your notes if you
[49:03] got them we're on number six we kept
[49:05] these notes Leviticus 25 eight nine and
[49:08] I felt number seven Sabbath's of years
[49:10] under the seven times seven years in the
[49:13] space of the seven Sabbath's of years
[49:14] they'll be under the forty and nine
[49:16] years okay then shalt thou cause the
[49:20] trumpet of the jubilee trumpet of the
[49:24] Jubilee message of the release okay it's
[49:39] so perfect until the release is this
[49:41] Jubilee then shalt thou calls the
[49:43] trumpet that's trumpet of the Jubilee to
[49:45] sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[49:47] month and the day of the tone will show
[49:48] you make trumpet sound throughout that
[49:52] word is taken
[49:56] the Hebrew lexicon number 86 43 and you
[50:05] know they got it go ahead it's number
[50:06] seven that little work jubilee look what
[50:11] it means let's remember soul eat a
[50:15] release but look what it goes back to an
[50:19] alarm a signal a sound of Tempest shout
[50:23] that's the words you believe it means
[50:26] shout shout blast of war or alarm joy
[50:32] alarm of wars in other words a battle
[50:35] cry applies a shout of joy with the
[50:38] religious impulse shout of joy in
[50:41] general the word Jubilee which is a
[50:46] release it literally means a shout
[50:51] because somebody's got to proclaim it if
[50:54] it ain't proclaimed we can't celebrate
[50:56] it now I said this morning so let's go
[51:03] to that go to Joshua we'll go to number
[51:05] eight and let's read this Joshua 633 216
[51:13] you can now you know what if this is
[51:15] when they come up to Jericho and the
[51:17] children of Israel was facing to the
[51:19] walls of Jericho go around about the
[51:23] city once I shall do six days when they
[51:27] got there look what they've done now
[51:29] usually seven church ages here's your
[51:32] perfect message and everything laying in
[51:34] order right in the Old Testament

[51:39] wasn't Joshua it was God telling him to
[51:43] go out there circle the city go back and
[51:47] camp next day circle the city go back

[52:19] with the trumpets and it shall come to
[52:22] pass that when they make a long blast
[52:25] with the ram's horn and when you hear
[52:29] the sound of the trumpet all the people

[52:53] touch shout bring it on up to the next
[52:54] one you can read all this in between it
[52:57] came to pass when Joshua was spoken
[52:59] under the people and watch him the
[53:03] Joshua's got to have a message all right
[53:08] cuz this prophet had a message Joshua
[53:13] had a message from God to tell him what
[53:15] to do how to do it everything he tells
[53:18] it to the people but the people came to
[53:23] say you know where's he tells them they
[53:24] would you shout when I shout another
[53:26] word well they didn't this jump up run
[53:28] over hey know everything had to be in
[53:31] perfect order they had to make the
[53:33] perfect amount of times they had two
[53:35] sets plays in order and then they got
[53:37] ready okay and Joshua commanded the
[53:40] people saying you shall not shout nor
[53:44] make any noise with your voice neither
[53:46] shall any word proceed out of your mouth
[53:49] until the day I bid you shout then shall
[53:54] you shout yeah it's nothing just oh we
[54:00] got it
[54:01] we're know the Prophet said I'll tell
[54:04] you what to do if we'd listened to the
[54:09] Prophet we wouldn't have to worry about
[54:10] all the other thing he rose up early in
[54:13] the priest an arc and he read it and
[54:15] they been when they did when they began
[54:17] to blow and all the others the walls
[54:19] went straight down now I
[54:23] I could think of it like this the
[54:26] prophets message is what's going to take
[54:29] Babylon down take things out of our
[54:31] lives take things away from us that are
[54:34] sinful and life of us living in things
[54:37] when we get the revelation of what the
[54:41] man is saying he brought us the message
[54:46] to tell us the freedom the release the
[54:52] things it would be his message you know
[54:55] what I love about brother Brown have you
[54:57] ever thought about really the word he's
[54:58] made one day where would a man have a
[55:03] right to come up and make a statement
[55:04] like this
[55:05] he said now listen I say this so and so
[55:13] he said now you say what I say you
[55:19] remember that he said you say what I say
[55:22] he said cause I'm responsible
[55:25] do you realize well I'll give an example
[55:30] you realize in brother runs early
[55:32] ministry that he talked to white horse
[55:33] rider was the Holy Ghost
[55:34] am i right did he do that you realize
[55:38] that somebody dirt never heard any
[55:40] difference than that never couldn't get
[55:42] ahold of no message that explained any
[55:44] of it you know what they could go around
[55:46] and they could say the white horse rider
[55:49] is the Holy Ghost now God is not going
[55:53] to hold that person responsible until he
[55:58] hears truth what about a man had that
[56:02] much of a say-so with God until he could
[56:06] say you say what I say because I will be
[56:12] held accountable there gonna be a lot of
[56:18] people there that you're thinking you
[56:19] don't be there because it's gonna be a
[56:21] lot of people that are that you think
[56:23] turned away from the message and went
[56:24] away maybe they never heard the truth
[56:28] don't throw stones what is that saying
[56:30] he who lives in the Glass House don't
[56:32] still throw stones you know
[56:36] the message Joshua commanded the people
[56:41] there is his message he commanded the
[56:45] people and told him said now don't you
[56:48] shout until I tell you huh he said but
[56:56] when I tell you you shout and go
[56:58] straight forward because God has given
[57:00] you the city well then like I've always
[57:04] said wouldn't it be something they said
[57:06] they can run chariot races over the
[57:07] walls and the things you know all around
[57:09] there wouldn't it be something that the
[57:12] enemy's setting up right of life and
[57:13] said they went around here seven times
[57:15] more they wore out everything seven
[57:17] times today for some reason now they're
[57:20] all out there hollering about that time
[57:27] the wall gives away and it's gone
[57:29] because it literally went straight down
[57:33] and then they just went straight ahead
[57:39] because they was doing what the
[57:41] messenger saying now we'll do that it'll
[57:47] take care of a lot of things all right
[57:48] now watch the word the word Jubilee is
[57:51] shout Joshua tells them to shout all
[57:58] right go ahead to the two number nine
[58:02] and look what the scripture says just we
[58:08] say unto thee by the word of the Lord
[58:10] that we which are alive and remain unto
[58:11] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[58:12] them around then which are asleep for
[58:15] the Lord himself shall descend from
[58:18] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[58:24] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[58:26] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[58:28] now the Lord Himself descends what did
[58:33] the Prophet say that it was he said the
[58:38] shout is the message the shout is a
[58:44] message
[58:46] the Lord himself shall descend in this
[58:49] message that's what he done he descended
[58:52] to earth in this message the Prophet
[58:56] brought the message to show that God had
[58:59] descended when God descended
[59:01] now remember I'm quoting brother Branham
[59:03] he said Jesus does all three in his
[59:07] descending alright who was it descended
[59:11] not brother Branham he had the job to do
[59:14] they had to be a man understand there
[59:16] but he had to let God bring the message
[59:20] God delivered it to him then he
[59:22] delivered it to us like it says in
[59:26] Joshua there they then when the people
[59:28] say what the prophets say it walls is
[59:32] coming down when the people say what the
[59:37] Prophet says the walls is coming down
[59:41] the Lord himself shall descend from
[59:43] heaven with a message are you looking
[59:48] for the coming of the Lord I think
[59:55] you're in bad shape the Lord descended
[1:00:00] in this message that we have in our
[1:00:02] possession
[1:00:04] that was his descending that was his
[1:00:07] coming in the message not the man coming
[1:00:14] thank God that had to be a man that had
[1:00:16] to be a messenger but the Lord Himself
[1:00:21] descended when he said for it first
[1:00:25] thing comes when he starts descending
[1:00:28] from heaven there's a shout what is it
[1:00:31] he's a message to get two people
[1:00:33] together the message comes forth to get
[1:00:41] two people together a shout and a voice
[1:00:43] and a trumpet shout a messenger getting
[1:00:46] the people ready all these is taking off
[1:00:50] the rapture message to get two people
[1:00:55] ready
[1:00:58] therefore the message calls the bride
[1:01:02] together see the shout and the trumpet
[1:01:06] in the same one he was allowed the same
[1:01:10] one he with a loud voice he screamed out
[1:01:15] with that shout and a voice and waken
[1:01:18] Lazarus now if you'd have been standing
[1:01:21] with Jesus you would have heard him say
[1:01:25] Lazarus come forth right that would have
[1:01:31] been his word but what was really
[1:01:33] bringing Lazarus from the grave the god
[1:01:39] that was standing there
[1:01:44] God was standing there in a body rock
[1:01:48] the Lord had descended from heaven
[1:01:51] you're looking for the coming of the
[1:01:52] Lord you're in your you're missing the
[1:01:55] whole point
[1:01:55] now don't misunderstand that and throw
[1:01:57] me in the wrong degree if you're looking
[1:02:00] for his descending you've missed the
[1:02:02] message of the hour because that's where
[1:02:06] he descended is there anything outside
[1:02:07] this message can you show me anything
[1:02:11] else outside of this message that is to
[1:02:13] be done come on here this message is the
[1:02:26] shout it's the Jubilee it's the release
[1:02:30] it's what sets us free is this message
[1:02:35] he didn't bind us like somebody said one
[1:02:44] time they said well I'd tell that person
[1:02:45] off but I'm a Christian I'm late that
[1:02:48] ain't it Christian you just said the
[1:02:51] wrong thing to me that ain't a Christian
[1:02:54] I tell him off I wasn't a Christian I
[1:02:58] just walk brother Colley I wasn't a
[1:03:00] Christian

[1:03:10] just whooping it right see this message
[1:03:15] is what I'm trying to get you to say and
[1:03:20] then Watchers why is it that we can't
[1:03:24] read and believe what we read well I've
[1:03:33] been believing this making a long time
[1:03:35] then see it produce you're in bad shape
[1:03:41] don't talk to me about that this message
[1:03:44] won't produce we've seen the dead raised
[1:03:48] we've seen their sick healed we've seen
[1:03:50] times right but I don't mind telling you
[1:03:56] have no problem then people run over the
[1:03:58] RC the city on the dead raisin that's no
[1:04:01] problem
[1:04:01] I don't degrade nobody or try to prop up
[1:04:06] something this message church is what
[1:04:15] I'm trying to get you to say we have
[1:04:16] within our possession I know I shouldn't
[1:04:23] say that I'm sorry how many of you have
[1:04:26] an ability to hear ever sermon brother
[1:04:29] branham it's preached how many of you
[1:04:34] can say that you heard basically ever
[1:04:36] sir
[1:04:47] we've got the message now I'm beta
[1:04:51] Proclamation while ago for next Sunday
[1:04:54] services it will be dealing for the
[1:04:58] future home now read anything you won't
[1:05:04] - because that's what forgets people you
[1:05:07] say I want you to listen to that tape
[1:05:10] bless good I'll listen any tape I won't
[1:05:12] true now don't tell me you're a
[1:05:15] Christian there's something wrong with
[1:05:17] your mentality let alone your
[1:05:19] Christianity and I've had people to
[1:05:22] throw stuff like like I don't have time
[1:05:25] for that like broke said one time this
[1:05:29] man who said some doing me he said he
[1:05:32] said brother said I preached on that
[1:05:33] said I got about 65 sermons are the
[1:05:36] priests own it and he did a statue a
[1:05:37] perfect man this brother said I ain't
[1:05:40] got time less than 65 messages well the
[1:05:43] Moke said you've been listening all this
[1:05:45] year and don't know nothing yet your
[1:05:47] change things around he was a little
[1:05:50] more sterner than I am
[1:05:51] and when he would say that but you
[1:05:56] understand why I'm good it's not to know
[1:05:58] who's gonna be pressed in it's not to
[1:06:01] know all about this that or the other
[1:06:02] all of these things is to know this
[1:06:05] message we have the message of eternal
[1:06:11] life there is no message nowhere outside
[1:06:16] of this message that has eternal life in
[1:06:19] it this message because this message is
[1:06:29] the shout the Jubilee the release you
[1:06:40] know stay a little while you know when
[1:06:41] Psalms where the where it says the Lord
[1:06:44] will go up with a shout and that'll be
[1:06:49] the background for next week it says the
[1:06:52] Lord she'll go up with a shout
[1:06:59] boy if he's waiting on somebody to shout
[1:07:03] and see I never have believed if that
[1:07:05] shout there was a holler you know what I
[1:07:08] mean if God told Joshua what to do go
[1:07:18] around the wall go around the wall do
[1:07:20] this then and sit stand and look at the
[1:07:23] wall noise and said just when I say
[1:07:26] shout you shout and go straight forward
[1:07:31] because the Lord has given you the CD do
[1:07:36] you think it was just a shower to hover
[1:07:38] yeah and the walls go for you could it
[1:07:44] really be when the people believes
[1:07:46] Joshua was the leader they saved a lot
[1:07:57] of problems and the people of this
[1:07:58] message if they believe brother branham
[1:08:00] is the leader because it would change
[1:08:05] the motor situations but the Lord
[1:08:10] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:08:12] shout then that means he's here word
[1:08:20] yeah you'll never see him that away with
[1:08:25] that attitude you'll never see God but I
[1:08:30] thought we were supposed to believe for
[1:08:31] the impossible I thought we were
[1:08:35] supposed to believe the impossible see
[1:08:39] this message is the Sabbath's Jubilee
[1:08:43] released the trumpet the trumpet is
[1:08:49] already sounded letter Brennan said on
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:54] 10 virgins and pretty sure he said a
[1:08:58] gospel trumpet when he says the trumpet
[1:09:01] life he said a gospel Trump and her son
[1:09:07] well like I've always said you mean the
[1:09:12] deads gonna be raised and walk among us
[1:09:14] we'll get together and we're as dead as
[1:09:18] we are today who won't even say Amen at
[1:09:23] least you could say old me right I mean
[1:09:30] and what throwing off on you yeah
[1:09:32] throwing off on all of us they were not
[1:09:40] I'm not looking for some kind of a
[1:09:42] message I'm not looking for something to
[1:09:44] take place I believe the message is here
[1:09:51] if there is anything else it will have
[1:09:54] to be brought by the message it can't be
[1:09:58] brought any other way than by the
[1:09:59] message that the very prophet brought
[1:10:01] unto us well I'm looking for this
[1:10:06] brother Dale I'm looking for that all
[1:10:08] right ain't gonna argue with you but
[1:10:13] it's just like I said are you looking
[1:10:17] for the coming of the Lord or have you
[1:10:19] seen the Lord descend and we're talking
[1:10:25] to people that set tower with the
[1:10:26] Prophet when he was preaching right are
[1:10:32] you still looking for something to take
[1:10:36] place or can you say the message has
[1:10:40] already come we at least have the
[1:10:43] message right because the Lord Himself
[1:10:50] has descended with the Jubilee time a
[1:10:52] shout and it ties together all the way
[1:10:55] through the Old Testament of their
[1:10:56] releases and things to tie to the church
[1:10:59] age releases ties down to the end time
[1:11:01] to work that there's a messenger comes
[1:11:04] that's the Holy Ghost to bring the Azusa
[1:11:07] Street message and then the Prophet
[1:11:08] steps on the scene with his message and
[1:11:12] declares Liberty you remember the other
[1:11:19] when I said I'm free that's what I'm
[1:11:23] talking about I'm free from any thoughts
[1:11:29] or ideas of trying anything else beside
[1:11:33] this message because I have no vote for
[1:11:38] know ourselves what about your salvation
[1:11:44] minds based upon one time is this profit
[1:11:47] right sort of toes and brothers were
[1:11:51] sitting down the stars are one day
[1:11:52] talking about something I said well I'm
[1:11:54] gonna tell you this like it is because
[1:11:55] it is where I stand if the Prophet said
[1:11:59] it I believe it I'll stand behind it but
[1:12:03] if he didn't say it that's this
[1:12:05] questions and answers and things we can
[1:12:06] discuss well you don't want me to you
[1:12:12] know what I didn't say nothing about I
[1:12:15] said that's where I stand this message
[1:12:18] is right it is the descendant of God I'm
[1:12:22] not looking for God to come you ever
[1:12:24] heard your prophet say I'm not looking
[1:12:27] for him to come I'm saying he's coming
[1:12:29] he said I'm saying he's here we know
[1:12:33] what may not have been to nobody in the
[1:12:35] world but it was to him he wasn't
[1:12:41] looking for something out there that's
[1:12:42] what caught my attention when I first
[1:12:45] heard him and heard the way of talking
[1:12:49] I've been through the philosophies of
[1:12:51] mankind and their teachings and ideas
[1:12:56] you know but I heard a man talk about a
[1:13:00] Living God we looked out
[1:13:07] well hopefully we will maybe we will I
[1:13:09] hope we're saying you ain't never heard
[1:13:12] people talk like that
[1:13:13] I believe I'm saved well when is it
[1:13:19] going to turn from belief into a fact
[1:13:25] the Lord has already descended with this
[1:13:29] message now I'm going to make these
[1:13:33] statements for the next service is
[1:13:35] coming on next week I don't want to make
[1:13:37] complain even to the people of this
[1:13:42] message they say Jesus come in three
[1:13:47] sons 9 our God come in three sons now
[1:13:50] son of man son of God son of David and
[1:13:57] that's right but here comes a prophet is
[1:14:02] the one that had taught us that over and
[1:14:05] over and over and one day he seemed
[1:14:07] something and he said right in between
[1:14:12] this coming of the Son of God down
[1:14:15] through the church ages and the son of
[1:14:17] David said comes forth the Son of Man
[1:14:21] you remember unveiling of God he's
[1:14:28] saying something when he gets to the
[1:14:31] future home is reading I'm asking you to
[1:14:33] read it he's bringing that message down
[1:14:37] so perfect and he's bringing it down he
[1:14:39] brings that seven he nails it down he
[1:14:42] gets it all nailed down and he's got
[1:14:45] that seven he's got that millennium and
[1:14:50] he plainly says something to this degree
[1:14:52] where do we go now because that's as far
[1:14:57] as he could see was the son of David
[1:15:02] sitting on the throne in the Millennium
[1:15:11] and he says we're missing it I'm just
[1:15:16] paraphrasing his words we read or listen
[1:15:18] we're missing it we're not seeing
[1:15:23] eternal life because the millennium is
[1:15:26] still under time and as long as you're
[1:15:29] under time you're not in eternity
[1:15:34] he says you're still under a seven he's
[1:15:38] because the seven is the seventh day out
[1:15:40] of Eden as I saying this morning that
[1:15:43] were God worked six days and rested the
[1:15:46] seventh seeing fell we fell in the
[1:15:49] seventh we fell into rest the Prophet
[1:15:52] said God is going to bring back that
[1:15:54] thousand years to prove that somebody's
[1:15:57] going to live a thousand years without
[1:15:59] dying he said to prove the sin curse is
[1:16:02] gone glory hallelujah it takes more to
[1:16:16] come
[1:16:22] there's more to come scriptures don't
[1:16:31] worry about it
[1:16:31] just listen and if you miss the services
[1:16:34] I ask you to please get too tight you
[1:16:41] miss the service there's some reason get
[1:16:43] the tape and listen to it you owe
[1:16:46] yourself you owe me that much because
[1:16:48] I'm going to be blown about something
[1:16:50] that the Lord showed me that's going to
[1:16:52] tie it all together
[1:16:55] if we keep dealing with a seven we're
[1:16:58] left in time and there's no rapture
[1:17:00] there was no rapture down through seven
[1:17:03] Church ages what about
[1:17:13] well you just got me start up good maybe
[1:17:16] you'll go listen because the main thing
[1:17:18] is if you listen to the message the
[1:17:20] future home and just listen to it over
[1:17:22] and over or read it and listen how he
[1:17:27] goes and lays it down and he gets it
[1:17:29] right up to a 7 and stops he said now
[1:17:36] brother branham said you've come to a 7
[1:17:38] he said where are you going from here
[1:17:41] I'll see mankind have never taught
[1:17:43] nothing beyond that he said oh I'm not
[1:17:49] out of the scripture yet you remember
[1:17:51] that he said I've got another day well
[1:17:57] how do you think people felt it was
[1:17:58] sitting there another day after the 7th
[1:18:02] we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 another day if
[1:18:09] you'll remember this it'll help you if
[1:18:11] you've got another day you've got a high
[1:18:16] of another part of your message and I've
[1:18:21] done that deliberately of what I say it
[1:18:22] because Rutter insame see starts back
[1:18:25] here and comes all the way through ok no
[1:18:27] problem then which you've got to have
[1:18:29] somewhere to put that now listen you
[1:18:32] think it I I preached it up to where the
[1:18:36] three sons nice and I done knew that I
[1:18:41] preached that 40 years ago three sons
[1:18:43] night and then here comes son of man in
[1:18:46] between son of God and Son of David to
[1:18:48] be able to transfer over to the
[1:18:50] Millennium now he's opened up from dark
[1:18:54] to the future home but I want you to
[1:18:58] think about it I want you to think about
[1:19:03] what could be between now and the future
[1:19:06] home what could be between the
[1:19:09] millennium and the future home it's in
[1:19:13] the future home brother Owen said now
[1:19:15] listen to his work he said there'll be
[1:19:16] things in the Millennium that won't be
[1:19:18] in the future home
[1:19:23] find that quote and read real careful
[1:19:25] around it there'll be things in the
[1:19:27] Millennium that will not be in the
[1:19:30] future I see we're not ending the
[1:19:35] message that's what everybody thinks so
[1:19:38] we're in the message we understand do
[1:19:39] you understand well why do we need to
[1:19:42] well are you not going to the Millennium
[1:19:45] don't you want to know where it's at and
[1:19:47] what's going on before you get there I

[1:23:32] and we think in Jesus name anybody else
[1:23:35] that have a need before we do the
[1:23:38] communion let's go to first Corinthians
[1:23:48] then at 11:23
[1:23:53] I have received of the Lord that which
[1:23:55] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:23:58] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:23:59] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:24:02] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:24:04] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:24:06] you this do in remembrance of me
[1:24:10] after the same manner also he took the
[1:24:13] cup when he had supped saying this cup
[1:24:16] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:24:19] use often often as you drink it in
[1:24:21] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:24:24] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:24:27] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:24:29] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:24:32] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:24:34] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:24:37] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:24:40] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:24:42] that bread and drink of that Cup
[1:24:44] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:24:46] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:24:48] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:24:50] body this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:24:53] among you and many sleep for if we would
[1:24:57] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:25:00] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:25:04] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:25:06] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:25:09] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:25:10] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:25:13] hunger
[1:25:14] let him eat it home that you come not
[1:25:16] together under condemnation the restroom
[1:25:18] I said in order when I come so let's
[1:25:21] just take a few moments of salat prayer
[1:25:23] praying one for the other the Lord would
[1:25:26] help us all
