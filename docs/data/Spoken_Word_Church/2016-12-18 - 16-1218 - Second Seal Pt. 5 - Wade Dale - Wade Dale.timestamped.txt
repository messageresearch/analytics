[0:02] I know you and I you know in normal life
[0:06] red and I've told you I want you to
[0:09] think of this while we're talking about
[0:10] it I'll turn it on in a minute but it
[0:12] won't something will come up with my
[0:14] Bible verse 10 the the color red is a
[0:20] two-fold now remember i told you the
[0:22] sanctification is what it's a great
[0:24] place to be but it's a horrible place to
[0:26] stay okay so that's why you take the
[0:30] color red I was looking at the color red
[0:32] last night now one on one side of the
[0:36] street red is what when you think of red
[0:40] you think of know what what stop when
[0:44] you think of red you think of what else
[0:47] blood but when you think of red you go
[0:50] to Valentine's Day the color red has the
[0:53] longest wavelengths of any color and
[0:56] it's the second most popular color but
[0:59] besides blue but when you look at blue
[1:03] you know that blue means a boy and bush
[1:06] guy but when you look at red and we see
[1:09] this red horse we also have to see that
[1:12] red means the blood the sanctifying
[1:15] blood of jesus christ but also go go to
[1:17] those i represents then i'll say the now
[1:23] they want to 18 come now let us reason
[1:25] together seven more though your sins are
[1:27] like scarlet scarlet and what red they
[1:31] shall be as white as snow though they
[1:32] are red like crimson they shall be as
[1:34] wool okay so that's why the brother
[1:37] brown said read through red is why you
[1:40] take the red blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:42] rid of your sins and put them together
[1:43] and then what you get a white righteous
[1:47] person alright so that's the cup away
[1:50] the red cook the color red you keep
[1:52] looking and it also goes the other way
[1:55] toward passion and and
[1:58] it's the most passionate meaningful and
[2:00] sometimes even deadly colored of all as
[2:02] a color aid Cody can be taken two ways
[2:05] same thing with this red horse same
[2:07] thing with all these seal it can be
[2:09] taken two ways sanctification can be
[2:10] taken too late you can stay under
[2:12] sanctification and be diseased and go to
[2:15] hell are you can take sanctification and
[2:19] go on and let it cleanse your sins and
[2:21] go on and walk with God to the baptismal
[2:23] ago and there's your perfect love are
[2:25] the baptism the Holy Ghost which is
[2:27] eternal life that's why I've always said
[2:28] that red color you know the old saying
[2:32] used to be that color insurance was more
[2:35] on a red color car well I don't think
[2:37] that's true but a red car is more
[2:39] noticeable climb because it's a blaring
[2:41] color you can't hide a red car you can
[2:44] hide cars with different colors and
[2:46] different in the parking lot but you can
[2:47] go and scan across the parking lot and
[2:49] you can study you'll stop at that red
[2:51] car pretty much every time until the
[2:53] same thing with with this red horse
[2:55] rider what's he doing he's riding
[2:58] through showing he said look at me look
[3:02] at me I'm going around look at me I'm
[3:05] doing that's what the catholic church
[3:07] did right got the church killed 68
[3:09] million Jews under this red blood
[3:13] looking horse they physically kill
[3:16] people and spiritually kill people right
[3:18] they said it's it's a two-fold it takes
[3:22] a lot more powerful meaning in the Bible
[3:24] because remember before the children of
[3:29] Israel left Egypt what happened they had
[3:32] to put the blood over the doorpost to
[3:34] rewrite they'll come the Passover
[3:35] symbolizing what the blood of Jesus had
[3:38] to be for us all right the same
[3:41] thing with you look and see that that
[3:45] the red goes all the way over to the red
[3:47] dragon which is the devil the red dragon
[3:51] spews you know water out of his mouth
[3:54] people all right but you have to look
[3:58] and see a saving grace of of red in the
[4:01] Old Testament what did they tell right
[4:03] after day put a blue pink orange no put
[4:07] a red color
[4:09] scarlet cord and brother branham I was
[4:12] reading last night though like nice not
[4:14] but the other day brother I'm said that
[4:15] scarlet red goes off that that red line
[4:17] goes all the way through the Bible see
[4:20] so there's your sanctifying but it's
[4:22] saved right but you know what it done
[4:26] though it killed all the other till they
[4:27] turned it down that's really right so
[4:29] you see that's why I said many times
[4:31] before and sometimes maybe this will be
[4:33] more of an impact that that part of
[4:36] sanctification that we come under as
[4:38] Christian it has a two full minute you
[4:41] can stay there be lost or you can go
[4:43] continue on and take that has got to be
[4:46] part of your process of being a
[4:48] Christian you can't just go from being a
[4:51] you know uh let's just say an alcoholic
[4:57] prostitute drug addict and then go
[5:00] straight you can say well i got saved
[5:03] that's justification that's just our
[5:07] terminology now in the world's
[5:08] terminology they see that you made a
[5:10] change and if you're now that's their
[5:12] born-again experience but see that's
[5:13] where the devil has got them in a lie
[5:16] the lie of that red horse riding that
[5:19] red horse is not riding out over
[5:21] yonder's riding through the churches
[5:22] people people and it's telling them hey
[5:25] you're okay um you know I out of this
[5:29] girl it works with us that she's always
[5:32] talking about the Lord out of one eye
[5:34] one side of her mouth from cussing out
[5:36] the other you know and i can get tired
[5:39] of it sometimes you get tired of eating
[5:41] you know I had another guy said one this
[5:43] I'm uncle Colin with this girl sure have
[5:45] the testimony and I said yes you sure
[5:47] have the testimony I but he wasn't
[5:51] thinking about not lean but by your
[5:54] fruits you'll be no sanctification
[5:56] though is a cleansing process but it's
[5:59] also a process that if you stay there
[6:01] you're worse off than if you'd never
[6:04] been saying before your to fold more
[6:07] child health and then you worse when you
[6:09] begun because you think you're okay you
[6:12] think you all right and that's one the
[6:14] denominational world they'll lay just it
[6:16] okay you're safe safe or what well I
[6:20] used to better know
[6:22] that's good alcohol and honest I'm into
[6:24] something that we but when you come up
[6:26] into this higher level of the opening of
[6:28] the seals though you have to come from
[6:30] not that sanctification that you got
[6:33] when when I put cursing and drink it in
[6:36] but then we smoke but you say put all
[6:39] that together drinking smoking cousin
[6:40] all put all together when I stop doing
[6:44] those things it was a sanctifying
[6:47] process in my life but it wasn't a new
[6:49] birth process it was a process oh and
[6:51] you birth but it wasn't the birth okay
[6:54] okay you can you can have water and
[6:57] blood and stillborn baby right so you in
[7:01] tight but you can't have a water blood
[7:05] and a baby crying and not having you
[7:07] birth you something that birth has got
[7:09] to produce a lot and a continual life
[7:12] but this part of sanctification is like
[7:14] juno come aces geez I die daily you have
[7:17] to die but you have to be washed you
[7:20] have to step under that blood and what
[7:23] brother I'm said the blood was in this
[7:24] hour the bleeding word of God the Word
[7:27] of God is the blood there is no literal
[7:29] blood hey there is no even even there's
[7:32] no red symbol of anything it's the Word
[7:35] of God Jesus Christ was the word the
[7:38] word bled and died and the word came
[7:40] back to living the believers and do what
[7:42] to them do the same thing to them that
[7:44] he did to him amen so that's but you
[7:49] look into in the higher form of the of
[7:52] the seals though when you see that red
[7:53] horse rider you see that there's a
[7:55] process going on that he's going out he
[7:59] the devil is going out and telling the
[8:02] people you're fun right you're okay
[8:06] everything is good you've quit this you
[8:09] quit that you've not doing this i don't
[8:11] know this anymore i don't do that
[8:13] anymore and so you just your ass yeah
[8:18] but the real rest is when you go to all
[8:21] the process the whole process of being
[8:24] born again then you are in a race but
[8:27] you rest from your sins you don't rescue
[8:30] read from you later because you still
[8:32] lately because what did this red horse
[8:37] do this reinforce when that spirit went
[8:40] out in that page right here of Columba
[8:44] if I got that the first three ages type
[8:46] the first field second seal times the
[8:50] fourth church age if I goddamn first
[8:54] three ages the Lion of the Tropic uter
[8:57] the lion opt man eagle and then the
[9:04] eagle goes on up the eagle there's no
[9:05] limit to legal he keeps lying okay but
[9:08] you got your lion ops man and eagle now
[9:12] in this age to get to this here to get
[9:16] to the you get to the capstone that's
[9:19] why that I were talking the other day
[9:21] this is the only time we could be the
[9:24] fullness of the Godhead Bobby okay the
[9:25] bride this is the only age they were the
[9:29] phone is for their time but this this
[9:31] age we got to be the fullness and take
[9:34] everything brother Brown says all for
[9:36] horse/rider so you got a call for combat
[9:39] beef all four I'm a combat these all for
[9:42] combat meats off everything of every age
[9:45] every seat Paul way down here he had a
[9:49] he had a super revelation but it was
[9:52] what the cornerstone right like we
[9:55] talked with which the cornerstone it
[9:56] wasn't the hex country excuse me i
[9:59] rinsed wonderful wonderful brother but
[10:04] he only had cornerstone all right all
[10:07] the way up to here even in the first
[10:09] part brother on his ministry that was
[10:11] the cornerstone coming back as we were
[10:14] jim was reading Zerubbabel the other
[10:16] night you sweep that thing off and what
[10:19] brother round head and go and start
[10:21] right back down there with the church
[10:24] with the church he had to start back
[10:27] down here quite the faith of the fathers
[10:29] the face of the fathers was not up here
[10:31] at that moment it was down here brother
[10:34] right I've had to bring from 47 263 had
[10:37] appreciate
[10:38] Ryan back up to where these were at here
[10:41] to begin with then what happened was
[10:44] what Satan gets on his horses horses and
[10:48] what does he do he takes the effects and
[10:51] brains it all the way back down to here
[10:54] remember he ate the Brian tree down to a
[10:57] lot of stunts stunts where's your stuff
[11:01] back stuffed on top of three stops at
[11:03] the bottom all right so he's started
[11:04] back at the bottom and said I will
[11:06] restore with what with four lion ox man
[11:11] and even you're going to restore with
[11:13] those four he's going to restore
[11:15] everything back now you've restored it
[11:16] back when you could become born again
[11:18] you have all four of those
[11:20] characteristics of the horse riders that
[11:24] is the new birth right okay the
[11:27] Lionhearts menon eagle that is the new
[11:28] birth and you know ryan had a had a
[11:32] question a long time ago the up he had a
[11:34] question that remember in Ezekiel he
[11:37] says how can they be facing in one
[11:40] direction but there's 40 you got you got
[11:44] you got to take the limitations off of
[11:46] God what you need for the time is if
[11:50] going forward it's not really in a box
[11:54] where you box you can't how many of
[11:57] y'all got a box for holy oh no you don't
[12:00] you got it so you got line ops man and
[12:04] eagle either way you look at cuz
[12:06] remember they all go forward you say
[12:08] well this one's going forward what's
[12:11] happened to these they're going side
[12:12] with no that's forward that's followers
[12:15] that's forward to next forward if their
[12:19] eternal well this is the way I look at
[12:22] it Lionel's man an eagle they'll face in
[12:27] the same direction if you need the bonus
[12:30] of the line he step front if you need to
[12:32] go into the office he stepped up if you
[12:33] need the boldness of the man he stepped
[12:36] up if you need to Eagle he steps up in
[12:38] other words what comes to the forefront
[12:40] of what you need that's what steps
[12:41] forward okay so if you'll see that that
[12:44] means they step forward okay so if
[12:47] you'll understand that
[12:48] you'll see that they do offline it in
[12:49] one direction don't remember they fly
[12:53] you chords word because it is work I
[12:57] mean there's work so it flies you
[12:58] towards the worm and it takes you toward
[13:00] the Word of God whatever you need and
[13:03] we're not we're not Catholics to the
[13:06] point we go god I need the eagle no it's
[13:08] just part of you it says the part of you
[13:10] can't piece it and pull it apart but you
[13:13] can see though that what's working in
[13:14] you is the boldness of the line the
[13:18] labor of an ops are the revelation of an
[13:22] eagle are the shrewdness of man you got
[13:25] rid quote yesterday very interesting and
[13:29] it was in things in modern events made
[13:34] clear by property brother Brad said the
[13:37] Lord would bring him something and he
[13:40] said I wouldn't see it immediately now
[13:43] you would think I mean if this guy had a
[13:46] direct tube from God into him you know
[13:49] yeah that one coming but he was still a
[13:51] human being he had to run that through
[13:53] this human filter he said I wouldn't see
[13:57] it he said but then what would happen
[14:00] was an angel said we'll read Isaiah I
[14:03] read Jeremiah read Matthew this is what
[14:06] I was saying and then brother Brown
[14:08] takes what the shrewdness of a man to
[14:12] put that run that through his filter
[14:14] because remember he got he thought Hills
[14:17] was eternal for a long time that was
[14:19] unless you're Baptist denominational
[14:22] theology and brother Graham said I went
[14:24] to preach on until one I saw in the
[14:25] Bible rule he had to hold it goes plan
[14:28] you see it you understand what I'm
[14:30] saying I what I'm trying to tell you is
[14:32] you may fight over thing he said why
[14:34] what I can't understand that I must not
[14:36] be boarding in that's not true right
[14:38] that's not true right at all you just
[14:42] don't understand it for the time and
[14:44] brother Brown said if you get there and
[14:45] you get under that spout enough he said
[14:47] if you want speak in tongues he said if
[14:48] you get under what if you start studying
[14:51] praying and asking God for something
[14:53] you'll give things right
[14:55] so back to the simple red now red
[14:58] stained red to me as a color that that
[15:01] catches your eye number one so what
[15:04] happened in this for of age during the
[15:06] time of Colombo remember that was the
[15:08] Catholic age they were getting the
[15:11] attention of the people right you go
[15:15] kill 68 million people under the under
[15:18] the umbrella of Roman Catholic Church
[15:20] then you put fear into people and that's
[15:24] what Satan wanted to do with that red
[15:25] North you want to put fear into people
[15:27] he wanted to make sure they saw him but
[15:31] what did he do though he was telling
[15:34] them that he was gone yes God's doing
[15:38] this if God is doing all this God's if
[15:41] you don't the Catholic Church's the note
[15:43] is is it if you don't see this then it's
[15:45] better like the Pope said it's better
[15:47] that we kill you then for you to live
[15:50] and be a Protestant now that's a lie the
[15:53] devil he was on his red horse he was
[15:56] riding fast and hard during that time
[15:59] but there was an ox kind of strange have
[16:04] you ever thought about this the red
[16:08] heifer the red heifer is the only
[16:11] sacrifice it's a female what's the
[16:18] heifer I see many all other sacrifices
[16:24] where he goes it was once she dope for a
[16:29] ignorance offering but the red heifer
[16:32] had to be brought up red no more than
[16:36] three hands of that whole heifer could
[16:38] be any other color that's why they're
[16:41] trying to produce it now they know Ben
[16:42] get the red heifer back because the
[16:44] ashes of the red heifer sprinkled into
[16:46] water of separation that starts
[16:48] everything seemed to have a gut you go
[16:50] make sacrifices all day long but unless
[16:53] you go by what the Bible says then the
[16:56] Jews know that once they get that red
[16:58] heifer that they can begin sacrificing
[17:01] brother Aaron said they would remember
[17:02] they will start sacrifices all right but
[17:05] it's kind of strange that she has to be
[17:06] ready
[17:08] and it's a woman i miss a girl it's okay
[17:10] it's well Jesus Christ the male
[17:15] sacrifice came to do one thing right get
[17:21] a what a female breath washer in red
[17:26] blood and she you say what she want to
[17:30] set you up we sacrificed herself daily
[17:33] this one honestly we are the red heifer
[17:37] we have to be burnt yeah in the fiery
[17:41] trials and all these things you know you
[17:43] you look at the redhead from you say man
[17:45] why she have to be a female and Christ
[17:48] comes as the mail well you've got to
[17:50] have Christ in a bride right so that red
[17:54] heifer really symbolizes you and I
[17:55] because remember we can't have no spot
[17:58] that's right without spot or wrinkle why
[18:01] because we're covered in that red blood
[18:03] all right so that's just a little
[18:05] somethin up then go in there i was
[18:07] looking at at at that the other day
[18:09] about the red heifer but she's ready
[18:13] she's clean she's cleansed and then
[18:17] she's the very first sacrifice before
[18:19] because remember why are they looking at
[18:24] Sasquatch so strangers so you get so
[18:26] many allegories and all these things but
[18:27] why is Israel looking to complete all
[18:32] the sacrifices they know the Messiah
[18:34] will come after they get finished with
[18:35] old sacrifice right how's it going to
[18:39] start the red heifer has got to die the
[18:43] red heifer has gotta disappear we got to
[18:49] go in the rack we got to go interactor
[18:52] before they can start then physically
[18:56] yes but it's going to turn into
[18:58] spiritual to where they going to look
[19:00] back and say that was it we don't have
[19:03] to do sacrifice what's the two minutes
[19:05] that's why the Jews are going to hate
[19:06] those two witnesses for 2,000 years
[19:08] they've been trying to get temple
[19:10] worship back and get and then all of a
[19:12] sudden here comes to guys out that says
[19:15] hey that's worthless God's not even in
[19:18] that temple
[19:20] where the temple of the Holy Ghost and
[19:22] then 144,000 come out they get
[19:25] persecuted that's why I've always said
[19:27] that that's why they're going to get
[19:28] persecuted is because man dem jus they I
[19:32] mean what if you worked your for 2,000
[19:35] years what if you worked and worked and
[19:37] worked and worked and worked at work and
[19:38] finally somebody said that's worthless I
[19:42] do okie for that I promise you get a
[19:45] deal we'll get you for that and not take
[19:47] not take no shame about it at all that's
[19:49] what they're going to do with 2 n's yet
[19:50] but when you see this red shimmy they
[19:52] just came in we look at the the color
[19:55] red is two different in two different
[19:56] spectrums we look at red as being you
[20:02] know remember the scarlet letter the
[20:05] girl in wanting to commit adultery and
[20:06] that that was red so you symbolize red
[20:10] with with passion and non purity but you
[20:13] also take red and it's absolute purity
[20:15] the shed blood of jesus christ is all
[20:17] through that's what that red scarlet
[20:19] brother brown somebody there's not a red
[20:22] scarlet thread all the way through the
[20:23] bible is true blood of jesus all the way
[20:25] from adam and actually the word Adam
[20:27] means read the word out of me and read
[20:32] so there you got red all the way from
[20:35] Genesis to the end of the book you've
[20:37] got that color red but when we talk
[20:40] about these seals though and we get into
[20:42] them let's read the let's read the
[20:47] description see if we get the thing
[20:49] pulled on there
[20:55] I look at that offer
[21:09] there we go all right we're on the
[21:13] second seal now watch when he had opened
[21:17] the second seal I heard the second beast
[21:19] safe which was what the office say come
[21:21] and see and there went out another horse
[21:25] that was red and power was given that
[21:28] sound him thereon to take peace from the
[21:30] earth so really it wasn't the horse that
[21:33] took peace from the earth it was the man
[21:36] sitting on the horse okay and he that
[21:39] sat on the horse to the peace from the
[21:41] earth but what is that red horse
[21:44] symbolized power of the people that man
[21:46] has no power on that horse if that horse
[21:48] gets knocked out from under in that's
[21:51] what weird to do where to take that
[21:54] horse and kill it power power if you and
[22:00] i give my brother brown say said if you
[22:02] want to get if you want to not be
[22:03] standing he didn't do the vice versa
[22:05] what are you doing resist the devil
[22:07] he'll flee from you well that's kind of
[22:09] example but if we would do that one
[22:12] little picture then what happens much
[22:14] trouble right now one mo scripter resist
[22:17] the devil you don't have to do penance
[22:20] and do all these things like the
[22:21] Catholic Church you know they start that
[22:24] was what Lucas problem was Luther's
[22:27] problem was that he would grew up and
[22:28] all that if you did this and thought
[22:30] this you have to beat yourself for
[22:32] crawling the floor so when God was
[22:35] starting to deal with him the old Luther
[22:37] was back there so the old lucre was
[22:40] still saying okay god I see that you're
[22:43] revealing something to me something more
[22:45] they gotta go depends you know he kept
[22:47] phone kept falling but God finally and
[22:50] finally one day Martin Luther stood up
[22:51] with the edict which was just a few
[22:53] month like a month ago then he nailed a
[22:56] thesis on the wall in other words he
[22:58] said this is my stand I'm not going back
[23:00] to that anymore this is where it is this
[23:02] is what gods revealed to me you don't
[23:04] have to do penance you don't have to pay
[23:06] money no no Venus which caused or what
[23:09] the Reformation that's why it's called
[23:11] for information could be reforming then
[23:14] all right they want another horse it was
[23:18] random power was given him and sent him
[23:19] to take peace from the earth
[23:21] that they should kill one another and
[23:24] there was given him a great sources kill
[23:26] one another it wasn't it really was it
[23:31] good people killing bad people right
[23:36] where did they get the people to kill
[23:38] from the Christian community they killed
[23:42] the Christian so they'll so what are you
[23:43] doing you're looking at to see the only
[23:46] thing with Constantine is when
[23:49] Constantine's sent out the Crusader
[23:51] memory cell division of a cross so he
[23:55] put the cross and while they call cross
[23:56] back that really didn't have nothing I
[23:58] don't think that vision he if he came
[24:00] from God he misinterpreted you
[24:02] understand what I'm saying I can't stay
[24:03] but what if the devil did the same thing
[24:05] and gave him that dream or vision to put
[24:10] across from the bass or what you do in
[24:11] the name of religion they killed 68
[24:14] million people they killed 68 million
[24:17] Christians they didn't go out then go
[24:20] out to borrow that's why I'm telling you
[24:21] now this is we're saying that he's not
[24:23] the barroom look at the same spirit come
[24:26] back around now not physically killing
[24:28] us but spiritually killing right try to
[24:31] do not going out there in the bar rent i
[24:33] mean the the catholic church was smart
[24:35] enough to know that they didn't have to
[24:37] go into the brothels in the end you know
[24:40] them the houses of robbers and thieves
[24:44] they went right straight to what the
[24:46] christian that's what that horse did
[24:49] kill one another so it was too same
[24:52] looking force you had one that was
[24:55] sitting in their house they had a cross
[24:57] they didn't pray to the croft but knew
[24:59] that that cross was the symbol of what
[25:01] that christ died for their sins but then
[25:03] you had another christian group that
[25:06] comes in with a cross killing you for
[25:10] believing in supposedly the same thing
[25:13] they believe yeah so you see where the
[25:16] deception is alright and that was given
[25:18] unto him a sword or work what happened
[25:21] here in this dog ate all this word of
[25:24] the catholic church comes out they had
[25:27] to latin vulgate right which is the
[25:30] which is the writings of the Bible they
[25:31] had it in Latin they had it but they
[25:34] would not give it to the people the only
[25:36] way they'll give them to the people then
[25:37] Luke on Wesley's day with 10 day of 10th
[25:40] del Y cliff and all those they took and
[25:43] put the Bible together and give it to
[25:45] the Christian people well the kinds of
[25:47] churches no you don't need that you just
[25:49] need to pre season so there was a
[25:51] separation there but that was his word
[25:56] against their work Satan's work against
[26:01] the revealed Word and that's the same
[26:02] thing it is now look how closes in the
[26:04] message false false preachers rainfalls
[26:11] birth all right and it was given him a
[26:14] great sword so that it didn't stop
[26:17] sometimes we think well that horse road
[26:20] and then it just disappeared still get
[26:24] that horse road and disappeared no the
[26:28] problem is is we have to see that when
[26:30] we get to that grizzled color are our
[26:33] brindled color horse it's all three of
[26:36] those colors in one it has become so
[26:39] powerful it's took the symbol of the
[26:41] flight the red and the black and mix
[26:43] them all together and that's what you
[26:45] get alright so the powers are going to
[26:48] head right here this is the power that's
[26:53] going to head up because remember after
[26:56] the fourth writer is gone after the
[26:59] fourth seal the rapture takes place all
[27:02] right I swear it just blows people mind
[27:04] but you can't when you take the seals
[27:07] you can compare them with the church
[27:10] ages but you can't go one from 1141 same
[27:13] way with the Ten Commandments that's
[27:17] thinking the other day the Ten
[27:18] Commandments is not first commandment
[27:20] first seal second commandment second
[27:22] seal no it's written in there you have
[27:25] symbols all through those 10 cuz you
[27:27] can't take 10 commandments make seven
[27:28] seals all right yes but you can combine
[27:31] them and show the same spirit and then
[27:34] you can show the seventh seal because
[27:36] there's not ten sale okay that's on
[27:38] Santa right so
[27:40] I stand I stand by this other day and
[27:45] all of us we have to do this we have to
[27:48] see these things in layers you're
[27:51] selling going you've got a natural
[27:53] happening you've got a supernatural
[27:58] happening or are all right and it don't
[28:00] have to be supernatural eternal Saints a
[28:03] supernatural creature right he ain't
[28:06] naturally supernatural because he works
[28:09] in another realm that's not come it's
[28:11] not defined like our realm it all right
[28:14] so you got the natural happening all
[28:16] these things were coming out where they
[28:18] went out and kill the Christians no
[28:19] that's a natural that happened in
[28:20] history that's written in boats it tells
[28:23] you that Constantine went out on a
[28:24] crusade killed CPA men but they don't
[28:26] call them Christians I don't think they
[28:28] just kind of weave it in but sometimes
[28:30] they were bad they were against the
[28:31] Catholic Church and all this but we
[28:33] understand the supernatural part of it
[28:35] Satan was given what a false word to the
[28:39] people and ingrained them so much so
[28:43] that's my brother i'll call this for
[28:45] days the catholic eight right yeah so
[28:49] that's when the Catholic Church really
[28:51] blocks them and really bloomed and
[28:53] everything come to a head is right here
[28:55] in this church age all right so we see
[28:59] all these pieces that's natural
[29:01] supernatural and then there's a
[29:03] supernatural revelation underneath all
[29:05] that member brother Graham said besides
[29:07] besides a revelation there's a
[29:09] supernatural element that we've got a
[29:12] scene I believe that supernatural
[29:13] element of this message here's our body
[29:16] change that's the supernatural element
[29:20] though we have a revelation though God
[29:24] reveals something to us I believe he
[29:25] revealed to M Martin Luther John Wesley
[29:27] brother Ronald had the apex or the Eagle
[29:30] anointing of the revelation so his was
[29:32] higher than anybody else but we as a
[29:34] group have got to put that revelation
[29:36] together and then there's another
[29:38] element a supernatural element that
[29:40] comes underneath all that you got a
[29:44] regular while you got a red horse now
[29:45] this was not a regular red horse it's
[29:47] not a literal red horse dead right okay
[29:49] you got them but the natural
[29:51] that tells us that in history what
[29:55] happened in history somebody got on a
[29:58] power that was red because of the blood
[30:02] and killed 68 million people we can read
[30:05] that that's just common that's just
[30:07] really history man can't man can't deny
[30:12] that it's kinda like the Holocaust you
[30:14] can't deny it its history it happen but
[30:17] now is that going number one that's not
[30:20] gonna save us that's right but if we
[30:24] take the spiritual part of that the red
[30:26] blood of Jesus Christ cleansing our sin
[30:29] sanctifying us killing us and putting
[30:34] his life in now we're into a
[30:37] supernatural park or you can stay on a
[30:40] supernatural part of the devil okay then
[30:43] everything is okay you can stay right
[30:45] here everything is fine everything oh
[30:47] it's just cozy we can come to church we
[30:49] can yo be there we come every day and be
[30:54] under this condition so see there's that
[30:56] but there's an element down here that
[30:58] what we're trying to get to it's what
[31:00] we're trying to get to it's that
[31:01] supernatural element that this these
[31:05] four horse riders all right these four
[31:10] horse riders has a symbol that you and I
[31:12] must see that's going on in your life
[31:15] they're separating the good from the bad
[31:18] but it's not just separating good for
[31:20] the baddest telling you that there is a
[31:22] combat beef to combat every one of these
[31:25] and it's in you and then when you get
[31:29] those four let me let me before we get
[31:35] there you got four seals in there a
[31:37] rapture takes place you say well we're
[31:38] going we don't need five six and seven
[31:40] no I think you need five six and seven
[31:42] for you body shame that's right 124 is
[31:46] is is getting you up to here cuz you can
[31:48] be right here and not take a body check
[31:50] brother branham was right here and you
[31:52] didn't think about you all right so
[31:55] there's a supernatural element that
[31:57] we've got to bring together in what's
[32:00] already written and I'm sorry to say
[32:04] this but you
[32:05] got to be careful there's a brother said
[32:08] something the other day here in the
[32:09] church and had time talk to him but I
[32:11] will tell my brother branham being would
[32:14] be scripture writing you know it would
[32:16] be you can't do that this is not the
[32:21] Word of God that's right no this is not
[32:26] the Word of God brother branham was not
[32:27] the Word of God he preached the Word of
[32:31] God that's right and this is God sure
[32:33] this is God to us hey the revelation we
[32:37] needed amen but this is god this is not
[32:41] another person another this is not even
[32:44] a prophet this is lee profit that's
[32:48] right okay good remember what to do'
[32:50] brother branham remember they got called
[32:52] in that he said well ram with the
[32:54] revelation you got you can write a
[32:55] twenty-third chapter revelation he said
[32:58] stop it right he said that's Antichrist
[33:01] that's true he said I can't add one word
[33:04] he said read in Revelation where it
[33:05] tells you right then to tell you cuz it
[33:08] dont and thats kinda strange right up to
[33:09] the last chapter says no add don't take
[33:12] away leaving it like it is and i'm going
[33:15] to send you some help yeah I'm gonna
[33:18] send you some help to understand what's
[33:21] already wrote so be careful don't don't
[33:24] and see us why brother and he is close
[33:27] you say what about sins being forgiven
[33:29] well that was the son of man doing his
[33:31] work I was reading in questions and
[33:34] answers Oh last night where brother
[33:37] Brennan was talking about it was right
[33:39] before mayors and divorces being free he
[33:42] said be still he said I have the answer
[33:45] he said I just got to get something in
[33:48] other words he's gotta go up to the
[33:50] mountain and let God say whatever you
[33:52] say that's the way it'll be all right
[33:54] but you said well that's and that is
[33:56] close but he's not God he didn't forgive
[33:58] them of their sins right God forgave
[34:01] them of their sins he won't you know
[34:02] what he done he brought them to a
[34:05] understanding that they could be
[34:08] forgiven man had killed him so much to
[34:11] where you know it was my mind said if I
[34:13] preach it right down the line he said
[34:15] everybody he said you know
[34:17] all out if kissing is a potential
[34:20] adultery I got Sam okay you understand
[34:25] what I mean but brother branham brought
[34:27] an understanding that what God had
[34:29] already said garnered already safe right
[34:33] what to do I stink another day I thought
[34:36] whoa well if they were so staunch in the
[34:38] Old Testament how did that one walk up
[34:40] to the well get preaching is good
[34:44] teaching had that one walk up to the
[34:46] well go and have five husband and once
[34:50] she's living with wasn't hers that's
[34:52] adultery she should have been dat dead
[34:55] yeah is that right and all right you get
[34:59] caught in the act of adultery you
[35:01] supposed to kill him she's in five times
[35:03] and the one she's living with you wasn't
[35:06] even hers why was she still alive what
[35:09] they had took and got Jesus then he said
[35:12] it wasn't so from the beginning yeah but
[35:14] you know the words you've watered it
[35:15] down so much till but now remember she
[35:21] wasn't so bad off that she didn't get
[35:22] forgiveness right yards dead ones home
[35:25] she needed husband number seven and
[35:27] found it yeah she found number seven
[35:30] nipple oil all right and he can read
[35:32] hurt a lot okay we know they may give it
[35:34] to a rock band but potentially you are
[35:36] telling fans cuz you can't you listen
[35:38] you can't give a woman at the well he
[35:40] turn a lot before the disciples they
[35:42] were the word bearers she's not she's
[35:44] sure she went and said come see a man
[35:46] yes that told me off what was she doing
[35:49] she was testifying and you can touch the
[35:51] pot that's fine no problem but she was
[35:54] given eternal life I believe she may
[35:56] went to the upper room but she convinced
[35:57] that in the meeting but she didn't get
[35:59] it before it Peter James gone no sorry
[36:01] they don't happen that's enough that you
[36:04] can take a coat from brother Brown that
[36:06] she got into our life but you've got
[36:08] what you guys go by your layers you got
[36:11] to come down to that supernatural
[36:12] element knowing one thing's for sure
[36:14] then eternal life was given to no one
[36:16] until Christ died and come back on earth
[36:19] at Pentecost and went into the believers
[36:21] hey that's what I've always said my
[36:24] questions been flying if you think you
[36:26] had this see than you all you out we
[36:28] think Peter bullet right
[36:29] James John we think they would already
[36:32] had it in them and walk with the word
[36:34] now what you just said receive you the
[36:36] Holy Ghost I like that name is Papu had
[36:40] the way to clinical it's right all right
[36:42] to where the word can be quickened that
[36:45] they have heard what so the word was
[36:48] there it took life same thing with these
[36:51] horse riders you say well that's death
[36:53] there's life in that take justification
[36:57] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:01] under the death part right and then what
[37:05] the 444 completes the birth now you got
[37:09] the word you got it what thats that
[37:10] revealed part of the word that nobody
[37:12] else had right nobody else had this
[37:14] revealed word right here that we're
[37:16] running through our filter every Sunday
[37:18] every Wednesday we're running this
[37:20] through the filter of our man annoying
[37:23] and worthless I put the spray wrong or
[37:27] we don't understand it like brother
[37:28] branham right now i'll find it i think
[37:30] you same questions and answers instead
[37:31] of instead of martyrdom is feel I've
[37:33] reading questions and answer so my ask
[37:35] him a question and he said well I don't
[37:37] get it up you know in other words I
[37:39] don't get it just like that that's right
[37:41] I have to go study it he'll tell me
[37:43] something and I'll not say nobody why
[37:46] would never how it goes just go I see it
[37:49] no you got to go through this thing good
[37:52] said he changed right head that's right
[37:58] and that's what you got that smile i
[38:00] love what brother Brown said he said
[38:01] face final resting places in the Word of
[38:03] God you can't put your faith in this
[38:06] comes every doctrine that's being
[38:08] preached is preached out of these books
[38:10] on blooming to Seoul seven thunders all
[38:13] being preached on this hey father son
[38:16] Holy Ghost baptism of eternal hell
[38:18] they'll be in priests out of this one
[38:19] yeah so you just be satisfied this year
[38:22] coming up you be satisfied know one
[38:24] thing's for sure if you're born again
[38:25] and you're sitting under a good ministry
[38:27] then and you're being fed then you're at
[38:30] the right place at the right time and
[38:33] let God do the rest let's not try to
[38:36] push this thing let God do the rest let
[38:37] God do it because what we're supposed to
[38:39] be doing Ruth did what Ruth decided
[38:42] right she decided to stay she worked and
[38:46] she rested and why did what didn't they
[38:49] only tell her says hey you just go rest
[38:51] is his time to go do this work Oh ass
[38:54] had to go due to work of kinsmen you and
[38:56] I can't be take the beer cans member
[38:58] down but we can have the kinsman
[39:00] redeemer in us right and what'd you say
[39:02] don't want thankful we go hurry my
[39:07] favorite time there is the fall and not
[39:09] used to bother me cuz it's the sign of
[39:11] death so one day welcome through the
[39:13] woods in North Carolina it came to me
[39:16] that the colors in call our fam burr and
[39:19] red and green and that's the Holy Spirit
[39:23] I see original color and Creed for life
[39:28] follow the harvest time I just believe
[39:33] you know spring is Resurrection and all
[39:35] but fall is when jesus said go out and
[39:38] reap the harvest put the tears over here
[39:42] he said wait till it fully mature when
[39:45] do they pull a matt or october november
[39:47] my weekend is why are you you look at
[39:51] those dates and you you know you get
[39:53] excited about certain things because you
[39:54] can what you rightfully a natural filter
[39:56] yeah but that natural filter is wrong
[40:01] unless it compares with the wording like
[40:02] just left brother Brad brother brown
[40:03] thought his brain Oh hell's got to be
[40:07] eternal I've been caught out on my life
[40:08] and then oh all the angel had to say
[40:15] well cousin angel can't hear you
[40:16] revelation I'm telling you angel did not
[40:19] get ever give brother random a
[40:20] revelation angels brought the word to
[40:24] him and he studied all day putting that
[40:26] thing together and finally I bet you all
[40:28] the angel said was there's an eternal
[40:31] hell it's gotta be eternal life and then
[40:34] brother Brown didn't just jump up and
[40:36] run out I believe he went right through
[40:37] the Bible when you talk man so this is
[40:38] it this is it what same thing can happen
[40:41] you same thing I'll help you when you
[40:43] get a revelation what is it God put the
[40:45] word together because Satan don't want
[40:46] that time that's right right if you get
[40:49] a revelation it's got to be from geico
[40:50] Satan will not
[40:52] you a correct revelation you'll give me
[40:54] a wrong one but he won't give you around
[40:56] never regardless go what kind of get
