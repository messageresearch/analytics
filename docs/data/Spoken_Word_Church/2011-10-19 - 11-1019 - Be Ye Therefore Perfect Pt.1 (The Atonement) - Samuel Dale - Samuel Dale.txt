to minister unto us for the weekend he's coming down for the Lord willing tomorrow be hunting a day or two and and in preaching for us for the weekend and just getting back in from Jamaica so maybe have some good report tonight for us just remember that and also remember then brother Ron Spencer will be with us the 29th and the 30th that's Saturday and and Sunday and we'll only be having one service on Sunday but we'll be having the uh having dinner together and fellowshipping together so just remember these announcements I know you you put them all down and keep up with them so just uh come and have a good time I think we'll have a good time for these brothers coming in and and speaking for usen but as like I said I want to just read one scripture we'll be seated then we'll pick up the rest of it all right so this is the thought that we'll be bringing for I don't know how many services maybe a couple of services anyway but uh let's go to Matthew 5 and then we'll just read to 1 verse 48 you Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us thank you for all things we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence because we worshiped we' sung about you we prayed to you we we poured out our heart unto you now and we've gathered here for one purpose and that's to serve you now we pray that you would just come on the scene now to manifest yourself Among Us and let your love be with each and every one of us just touch each one Lord take away that problem brother Danny there's having with his leg Lord and just let him be delivered let everything be all right we love you and we thank you we ask you to just guide us now forgive our sins because that's what we want to do is stand complete in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus is your name just going to read one scripture very familiar with everybody everybody can quote it by heart Matthew 5:48 says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I'll be using this for a couple of services I'm sure and trying to bring a thought so uh we will just go with it as far as what the Lord leads but everybody you know wants to go through this scripture and they try to figure it out that it means this and it means that and that's fine um you know it means a full age it means you know uh different things and all and we will get back to those things as we go along but what I want you to think about is what is the background are the reason this statement is made all right so we remember how that we've talked about the before and the after is the answer to to all things and so what we want to do is just back up a little bit and uh brother Joe will be putting it up there from verse 37 if you want to follow that and and you know read with us but this is Matthew 5 which it starts off and it's called the Beatitudes all right so you go about somewhere around 10 verses or something like that and you're covering the beatitude you know blessed is he that this blessed is the pure in heart blessed is all of the things and then it changes to uh what if you'll notice especially scofi uses the word there and it changes from the Beatitudes to the similitudes which similitudes means like your your likeness or or something you know taking place all right so you know I want you to think with it cuz we're going to go with this and just get a point out of the way then we're going to drop way back in the Old Testament and come up to talk about our thought for tonight all right but as I said now the the Beatitudes that's be your attitude words blessed is he and that was he was telling us you know how that how blessed we was and are and then the similitudes brings in to our lives the things that you know we're we're talking about in the bless so we're not going to read the whole thing but we'll just stop up and start on verse 37 of uh this Matthew 5 and I'm I'm just telling you just think about why did he say the seemingly going along and covering this and covering that and going this away and going that away and and talking about life and what we should be and what we need to be and and all in and and the the the things that our lives should be manifesting and then all at once he just says be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect well now what's the background for that so let's drop up there and Jo got it up verse 37 so you just follow with us now but let your Communications be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and what and who soever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twine wow give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies amen bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute not that you may be the children of your father and watch that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same right and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now like I said did he just coming along and talking about her attitudes and her similitudes and the way and all like that and then all at once he just says be therefore perfect it seemed like that it is a uh and forgive me because I don't know no other way of saying it but it seems like it's an out of text right thought I said seem like you know it seemed like he's just coming along and going through these things and he just says go right straight on with it but uh I don't think so so that's this is going to be now the background of of what we're going to try to bring out because notice especially now you don't have to pull it back up but look what it says in verse 43 you have heard that it ha been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy okay but I say unto you love your enemies now the point I want you to see is to me there is a dividing between the fact of what he's telling us and the fact of what is being really said in the word and what I mean by dividing it one of them is saying like we've read there somebody do good to you it's easy to do good right you know right it's easy to pray for somebody that's praying for you it's easy to be good to people that are good to you but where is the Perfection there the Perfection is not in being good to those that are good to you right right that has nothing to do with it see I wrote my Bible this way but I say unto you verse 44 love your enemies see God does it this way God does it this way that's what I wrote in my Bible God does it this way he he loves his enemies right he loves them that persecuted him he loves all mankind righten he loves nobody and that's what makes him perfect now come on when you drop down here see then it's coming into view that you're talking about a Perfection or being perfect as your father so that's what he's saying if we can't do these out of love then what good is it right amen if we can't love those who hate us yeah where's there any perfection in it where's there any of the life of God now we surely we know for certain that God is perfect right there shouldn't be any question with anybody's mind know that that God is perfect well if we don't display the things that he displayed in forgiving and doing and all how can we even talk about perfection if we don't do like he done why even talk about what the whether this word perfect here means partially forgiven or all the way forgiven or growth development or or some kind of a thing see the background shows you the Perfection come on Amen you have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you here's my nature here's my way here is my perfection love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which def spitefully use you and persecute you can you do that well I talk about being perfect right all you got is definitions of words right oh perfect that means complete hey yeah I know that I preached it myself I believe that we'll get back to that that's right the follow own man why do you want to do these things why do you want to beat the word that you can bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and pray for them that even persecute you you know that it was who was it polyart requested permission when they came to capture him to take him in and finally killed him he requested permission and was granted to pray for the sin of the people and pray for those people that come to capture him and gave him 2 hours and he prayed for him now that's Perfection you understand what I'm getting at do we can talk about perfection is being a sinless position is that what it is is perfection a sinless position when the uh the Pharisees the high priest especially we would just use him if one Mark was found against him they would take him out and kill him Paul said concerning the law you know that he was blameless he's perfect cuz the word blindness would be Perfection right perfect same word so what is perfection and what's it based on now wonder that brother around and said that you know no matter how high you jump said make sure you can walk straight and you come down right why because that's a display of of your life now did Jesus do these things did he pray for his enemies did he pray for them that persecuted him did he you know desp did he what what are we supposed to do same why verse 45 that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven right if our lives don't display that we're the children of God then who whose children are we right right come on you can holler Faith all you want to you can holler Revelation you can holler I believe the message you know you can holler all you want to but remember the statement what is it I can't because of your life I can't see word you saying right the word you're talking about right they that you may be the children of your father in other words have the very nature the Perfection of the father for he maketh his son watch now for me he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust now because of brother Ram using that in the vision that he saw of the the Earth you know the the the trees and how the rain fell on everything see we just take it to be like that well that just simply means that it'll rain out here on a tree it rain out here on the grass it rain out here on this it'll rain on the good it rain on the bad it rains on the the weeds as well as it does on the others and we just well we got it all figured out have we right that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven because of his nature and his Perfection that he wants to display right he maketh his son under rise on the evil and on the good sers Reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not this even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public cons Soul that's right be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect now we can get definitions like I said we can go through the Greeks we can go through and we'll cover these things as we go along cuz I'm sure this is going to run into few Services anyway but let's drop back let's start with man in his sinful condition and that God made a way for that man to be perfect right right now here's where we go nobody can be perfect if God says you are you are right let no man argue about what God says right when God says you're perfect that's it amen who can argue with him about it well you know we all do wrong who worried about that we all know that right to it evidently ain't based upon a lot of that stuff what is it based on what is perfection based on simple question simple thought cuz this is what simple I am huh coming down to the end of the series and this is not the end I just keep going on a little higher but you know we kind of get away from a thought we were bringing and get to another one I thought Lord where in the world am I going now and I heard brother around say something and I said okay we'll go there and then it began to develop all right but now if you can't understand something the best thing to do is to go back and pick up a type or a background or a talk right so let's drw back in the Old Testament and pick up a top and let's follow that down through and tonight specifically now so even if I read something in a minute I'm dealing only with the Old Testament Saints and the conditions that existed you say well brother Dale were they perfect little Pharisees you couldn't name one thing that done come on right is that right come on I mean am I right they could you couldn't find anything they done wrong right well if they had done anything wrong right how close were they to being perfect right right because you got to remember that perfect would will symbolize and when we finally get to it it will come out to be you're not guilty because you can't be perfect if you're guilty right come on right you agree you're guilty of anything can't be perfect the Bible said though if you're righteousness doesn't exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you'll no way in okay but see that's way on down the road let's just go back let's drop back and I didn't give these to Joe so we Len use it but let's go to a little scripture and let's start a thought a thought of somebody being perfect as I said then you go ahead and toot toot your horn do all nobody's perfect well if God says I am talk to him about it amen that's right a no arguments he'll tell you whether I am or not amen I thought there was a man there one time that that God was so proud of him until he said have you considered my servant job you know it may not be the wording there because I didn't think of that scripture but you know God was saying job is perfect right y right you know what happened cuz he'd offered the sacrifice right he done what God said he was not guilty his buddies tried to cond him sin he said I'm not s he said I've made the atonement that God said cuz that's what we're going to be talking about tonight the title of be the be therefore perfect and we'll just start part one but the tit subtitle will be the atonement so let's go back to Exodus and just watch this as we come down go to Exodus 30 now what we're doing tonight is like I said I'm going to be laying down all we through the service tonight the the the the Commandments of God the the what to do and and the things like that and and and God looking down at those people and he saw them perfect right as long as they done what he said he saw them perfect no no no that couldn't be perfect brother we know we'll get to that okay come on but as far as God was concerned that's perfect now you talk to him about it right I don't care what your thoughts or ideas are mine are yours either one if we can show it in the word s in the word that's it come on look at Exodus chapter 30 we just start off about the atonement verse 9 you shall offer no strange incense their own he's talking about building the Altar and getting everything ready the Ark of the Covenant The Mercy Seat all of the things the Commandments you shall offer no strange incense there own nor bur sacrifice nor meat offerings neither shall ye poor drink offering their own and Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offerings and for atonements once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generation it is most holy un to the Lord now we know that what God commanded he gave it to Moses right right God gave Moses the Commandments of what to do right so now get that in your mind of what my point he gave to Moses Moses tells the people they write it down they keep a record everything said you know and God tells them to do this and don't do this and don't do this do this don't do that and and one time in there I I don't I try to remember get to it in a minute in the scripture but one time in there they had a little situation came up that they they went back to what Moses had said and they found out somebody had done something said what we going to do cuz we don't have no record of what to do and Moses didn't even have a record of what to do for that situation so he goes before the Lord and he comes back and he says we take the guy and kill him that's what he says do it you know what they done they took him out and killed him because God's word was passed down through into Moses right so in the writing of Genesis actually Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy is the writings of Moses that God gave unto Moses his word right amen right all right now he said do this every year so every year Aaron now they had many atonements right I I looked in this I thought oh Lord that's 60 or 70 times the word atonement in the old test might even be more than that I thought I sure I can't cover all this so I just use this one but he was told to make an atonement now there was atonement for all kind of things there was atonements because you you you you got jealous there was offerings that you had to make right there was offerings you had to make because of a a male child being born there was offerings you had to make for this all of that was atonements all right now the word atonement means to cover it means to purge make an atonement make reconciliation cover over with pitch you know like tar put on cover over it means to be covered now that's what atonement means okay now you got other definitions as you go along with other ones because it'll have a little varying and that's 37 uh 20 strong you got a little variation in the word atonement but just remember it's basically talking about a covering all right so once a year Aaron had to go because Moses told the people what God Said right now want that in your mind Moses told the people what to do God told Moses what to do right now I've always said it this way what if Moses would have walked out and said now Aaron what you do is you get all your clothes on and you go stand on your head well if that have been what God said you know what Aon had to done come on he went stood on his head and he got all his clothes on right cuz that been what God Said So Moses didn't shortcut it nowhere he brought exactly what God Said to do like I said even in that one case where he didn't even know what to do he said God what I do he said take him and kill him all right now so once a year they had to make an offering an atonement for the sins of the people you know what that done we'll get down to it in a minute when we get to our thought that covered the people right right atonement covered now it couldn't do away with it but it could cover it right it can make the people stand before God perfect that's right right yes sir you said no not well you tell me what it was they were covered amen how was it that Adam and Eve could walk out of the garden in the sinful condition they existed in because God made the atonement and they were covered so when I get the word covered and you'll see what I'm talking about how it made them perfect so you can go down the street out here and run if there is no law you can run 90 mph right or what is that Autobon thing overseas over there no Li speed limit to it you just run anything you want to cuz the law doesn't say anything but when the law says 30 we run 30 right well because you break it if you're running 29 you can't be fine now we we're in the day when the garbage Canin police officers will do anything in the world we get that out of your mind get what I'm talking about you running 29 you can't break the law right so we justify right and we're going to find out what justifi really means one of these days when we get back to it cuz it'll all tie into this so you see it once a year he go in and make a sacrifice and you know what that done that covered that and you know that God could fellowship with the people for one more year that's right and they wasn't killed cuz they were covered he made an atonement drop over to Leviticus let's get another one while we're here and then we'll get our talk going look at Leviticus n we read about seven verses and he came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the Elders of Israel and he said unto them said unto Aaron excuse me take the a young calf for a sin offering and a round for a burnt offering without blemish and offer them before the Lord and unto the children of of Israel Thou shalt speak saying take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering also a bulock and a RAM for a peace offering to sacrifice before the Lord and a meat offering mingled with oil giving you this to show you many atonements for to the to the day the Lord will for today the Lord will appear unto you and they brought out that which Moses command commanded before the Tabernacle of congregation and all the congregation of congregation Drew near and stood before the Lord now who is they really standing before okay now Moses was doing all this who was there really standing before right why did they get in trouble back there for what they' done with Moses come on and Moses said this is the thing which the Lord commanded that you should do and the glory of of the Lord shall appear unto you and Moses said unto Aaron go unto the Altar and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering and make an atonement for thyself and for the people and offer the offering of the people and watch and make an atonement for them as the Lord commanded all right make an atonement so an atonement means a covering it was done once a year many atonements I read this to get in the words atonement but get into where that you had it for the meat offering you had this right you had that one you had all kind but the Commandment was from the Lord but if you'll notice Moses was always telling them what to do right okay now follow that in a minute till we get down to something we know that every sacrifice that was made would be speaking of Jesus Christ that's right that's a later sermon okay it could only cover sin the sacrifice back there could only cover sin he could not do away with it because there was no soul in the life of the animal to be able to come back upon the believer so every time he offered the animal see it only covered brother Harris used to bring it out was called the word Capo all right everything was as we call it pushed forward because that animal life even though it was taken in the place of man and and what it would do then the blood would be placed there and as it was then God would looking at the blood of the animal and not looking at you and brother R said you had to take your hand lay it on your sacrifice right and said the blood would be in the animal kicking and that and said what you would do said you would lay your hand he said you believe then that that animal was taking your place so it made a covering amen all right he could not do away was sin it pushed everything to Calvary where that Romans 6 and: 10 said that he died under sin once right see Jesus Christ died to pay for all sin right amen now as we were bringing out in the last message that how that those Old Testament Saints could come up and that would show that we would not have to go through the tribulation right I hope you followed that message cuz those Old Testament Saints came up what those that were under the atonement not everybody those that were under the atonement would be able to come up why because we don't have to go through the tribulation for perfection right they were perfect now I know this ain't going to go over too good with some of you probably it's all right just go ahead you keep your computers running but after a while you might find out that we do know a little bit about what we're talking about cuz I got a couple of questions don't ask you see it was all pushed forward to Calvary right that's right it could only be covered it could not be eradicated or his brother around would use divorced amen so it can only be pushed forward and Jesus Christ then died for everybody but get the point now as long as it's said offer that lamb for one year God couldn't destroy those people right right cuz they were under the atonement that's what your atonement was for see so every time you'd come up you'd have something take place you'd have to make an offering you'd have to make an atonement cuz that was your natural life this was the big situation that covered whole Camp as far as uh not being eradicated you know the lamb once a year but then we had each one like the said as we come down then be our attitudes and if we don't follow the similitude doesn't match up with the beatitude say hey what do I got to offer a sacrifice Aaron made it that was for the C cing for everything but each one individually had to be made right if you didn't you were destroyed if you didn't go down and make an atonement for a baby the baby could die right you understand see all of the things has got to match together but when God looked down at Israel he saw on the apple of his eye right he could come down and fellowship with them right the dirtiest thing could be done that even who was it B would would go before the Lord you know or Baum there so look at the hinder Parts he don't see nothing right he said they're under the sacrificial lamb they're perfect right so we might find out Perfection is a little bit different than what we think when we get time all right so then what are we doing let's just make sure that brother randoms covers these things so go ahead and pull up the the number one quote brother Joe see some people would argue with you about the the thing so we we got a prophet so we just put up what he says and then forget it so on questions and answers part two are number two paragraph 35 1954 103 the evening service now there was a time that the people didn't go into the presence of God when they died the justified in other words the good people that was in the Old Testament they went into a place called paradise and there are The Souls of the just waited in Paradise but Paradise was a place where God kept the souls in like a dream land until the blood of Jesus Christ was shed for the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin it only covered up sin but Jesus's blood takes away sin so we want to get that last part but I just want him to get these points and you seeing what he say that that blood of the bulls and goats couldn't do away with it it couldn't eradicate It could only cover all right go to the next one paragraph or e75 the Queen of Sheba 6110 and then God was with us God above us and God With Us in Christ Emmanuel God With Us and then when that blood cell was broke at Calvary and the blood was shed the spirit under the old dispensation sin was just covered not forgiven covered because the blood of goats and Bulls could not take away sin it only covered it then he goes into the life how it gave it life and the things would happen but there was no way for to be done right going down to the next one God hidden hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself the same paragraph 407 but when he crossed he separated his son ship he's a center by Nature he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan and God took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood but the blood of bulls and ghost did not divorce sin it only covered it that explains a cover if I got a red spot on my hand and covered it with white the red spot still there see it's still there but God s down from heaven obl for sin but it was the blood of his own son see so that would go on further all right that's what I'm trying to just hold it to the point next one message called look paragraph 6963 428 God being full of grace and mercy took a substitute and it was a lamb or an animal was offered a substitutionary death but the blood of bulls and goats as Hebrews here said just previous to where I read cannot take away sin it only covered it it was a perpetuation truly but it just covered sin for it was speaking with a good conscience looking forward to when the blood would come that would cleanse sin and or divorce it or put it totally away now Hebrews 10:4 says it's not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin all right you could only cover it right but don't lose the point now we're trying to go on to Perfection a Perfection that is beyond Perfection but just remember if you offered what God said you're perfect that's right that's what he said about Job God was he's bragging about it have you considered my servant Jo man is just and upright that's why when he sat there before those three guys that was trying to condemn him he said I'm not guilty they said a God wouldn't do to you what he's doing if you wasn't guilty he said I've offered the offering it proved later that he had he had even offered the offering for his children that's how perfect the atonement would be he had even made an offering for his children remember right said pre- Adventure they've done wrong you know what there was what seven of them and they were killed right he lost all of his animals lost all the things but when God finished it up showing he was right he got his seven children back for seven children here and he got the seven over there the prophet said that's right and he got double for everything he had is perfect right but you see we only dealing with we only think about perfection is through Jesus Christ that's what I'm trying to show you right the atonement spoke of Jesus Christ every atonement that was made spoke of Jesus Christ that's right all right then we look at Perfection as to think that it's to be born again that's wonderful but is that all you know about perfection what about perfection if God required it now back this Matthew 5:48 brother R said if God required that said he had to make a way right said he did to his own self right now everything looking forward to Calvary right but I want to read one more scripture I want you to read with me look at Exodus 32 look at Exodus 32 now verse 30 now this is when the children of Israel had sinned and the thing that went wrong and and our about the C and and whatever and you know making the C and the different things and he comes down and what did he say and it came to pass on the marrow that Moses said unto the people you have sinned a great sin and now I will go up unto the Lord pray Adventure I shall make an atonement for your sins are you reading it you after on the internet and things are you reading it I'm reading in your scriptures what offering did Moses offer right what offering did he offer he said you sin this was the golden cave and all of the horrible right he said I'll go before God that's right and pre Adventure I shall make an atonement see your first time thought would be you'd say that Moses is saying well now God and now the people I I'm going to go up here and I'm going to offer an atonement and maybe some way if I get the right one you'll be all right but where's the atonement he made right see we're going to find out what Perfection is right oh my we're going to find out those Old Testament Saints as long as they followed that word and done what it's doing that's perfect go perfect means not guilty see we think a perfect is some kind of a you know oh look at that that's perfect we got our eyes on some kind of a scale that makes it that way but where's the atonement that Moses made that's all I'm asking you right amen now where you catch on real quick brother Joe pull it back up and we'll follow own right I want to ask you a simple question which is the most important the atonement that was actually made or the word of God that said to make the atonement I don't go wrong with me all right I say that to click people where they won't than they so you don't run it don't go wrong I know the atonement had to be made right right come on that offer the offering I just got to covering that if you didn't you got in trouble right you was in trouble with God if you didn't make the atonement that was said to be made come on but I'm asking you a question what atonement did Moses make there's no record there that he took in the handful no okay can you pull that back up brother Jo look at verse 39 let's go drop it down if you can let's I'm going to go back over verse 30 this 32:30 and it came to pass on the mar that Moses said unto the people you have sin a great sin and now I will go up unto the Lord pray Adventure I shall make an atonement for your sins and Moses returned unto the Lord and said oh this people have sent a great sin and have made them gods of gold I want yet now all if thou Willl not forgive their sins sin and if not BL me I pray thee out of the book which thou has written sure we go on with the rest of it then the Lord said unto Moses whosoever sinned against me him will I blot out of my book therefore now go lead the people under the place which I have spoken to you behold my angel shall go before thee nonetheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them and the Lord plagued the people because they made the C which a and me but do you see what I'm talking about can you look right there and see what I'm talking about what atonement did he make brother R said he wondered about that right right bring the others up brothers let's get this then we'll get on down to more to the point number five 54 the 2 SE 63 3:19 there Moses took the place of Christ amen then to throw himself in the breach and said don't do it Lord see and of course he after he ordained Moses to do it to do this and read it he didn't come over Moses right because he was acting like Christ in that time it was Christ in Moses absolutely right Moses was ordained to bring the word of God a man that went up on a mountain and stayed just prior to this scripture to get to 10 commandments to bring them down 40 days and 40 nights without water or drink you know food no man can live like that look at what the prophet said he was acting like Christ in that time God couldn't go over Moses okay souls in prison paragraph 116 there was a scripture that always puzzled me how that Moses could tell God a better way than God had till I found out that it was the spirit of Christ in Moses see going down to the last one paragraph 83 Look Away under Jesus and there was another one that puzzled me that was when Moses could tell God a better way than God know how to do anything when Moses said the people will say now this is tied together two different scriptures if you understand your scriptures CU this is the this is one here that we're dealing with but the other one is when you know he goes before him and he's actually says it and I bring it out the other day your God was able to bring them out but not able to keep you and Moses threw himself in the breach then later I found found out that Moses that was Christ and Moses standing for the people now the Salvation lay in the atonement or the Salvation lay in the one who required it you better lay in the one that required it because if not then your idea is like I used to have I used to think that ever Israelite was saved why cuz he made it own you didn't take that away you know they done what God Said So here comes a guy and he just walks up and he just grabs L he CL it down he said kill it I'm going off and do it again now was he forgiven why was it the almighty God would say my nostrils is sick of your sacrifice I'm fed up with him right who do you look to Lord he said I look to a man with an honest and a contrite heart we'll get to that scripture in a minute CU there a few more words after that but what do you think about it we know that was Christ in Moses so really where was the offering Moses made did he take a lamb lay it up he l no no he reminded God of his word God had said he was going to take the people in God had told Moses that the children of Israel was going to the promised land like brother said if God wanted to because he said God actually told him said just get out of the way that's the other one that's there there are two different scriptures he said just get out of the way I'll just destroy every one of them and I'll just take you and I'll raise up another nation and he could have done it but Moses reminded it right it will be said of you if you let all of them be destroyed that you could bring them out but you couldn't take them in I used to wonder about that I told you the other day I used to read that when I was in the Baptist no I like to read then and I think well how's this guy telling God a better way of doing something I didn't know the word better way of doing something or anything like brother R talking about I just knew that this man had some kind of a connection this man Moses he had some connection somewhere I guess it tickled at it with brother Tom faush he used to tell about when he was on that aircraft carrier and uh you know I mean you know how you the the uh the the commander what you call him you know of the boat I mean that's his boat that's why he's Alles to go down he's supposed to go down with the boat because if that boat goes down so far and everybody's abandoned it and it jumps back up by a big wave and ares itself and the captain's gone anybody that gets on there the boat belongs to them come on so the captain was supposed to go down with the ship that's how much Authority he had right he marry perform weddings do all kind of things he's just as much a president as anybody's a president cuz I said it's a little country right that's right and butd everybody saluted him my brother Tom told about this one guy and he said I don't know what in the world he had on that Captain he said but I never seen him salute him he said every time we come you know we oh we pop we saluted CL he with he said Captain walk up and I don't God H call his first name I don't remember what it was but say hey Sam how you doing don't cap say doing great Joe he said I don't know what he had on him but he said he never saluted the captain and my point is what he had something to keep him covered either something he knew about the captain or whatever he had something that kept him covered that's what I used to think about Moses Moses what what do you got when you can actually tell God but what was he doing he was reminding god of what he had said with no special deal he was just he was no special guy right when he's ready to kill him over there right God would have killed him mhm but yet see Moses just knew the word there's Christ that's right there was the atonement that Moses said pre Adventure I can make an atonement so Lord if you're going to block them out right if you won't forgive them just take me right he said Moses I can't come over you right I ordained you for the job I can't come over you take them moment right sure later he finally had to say Moses because of all the problems right you didn't sanctify me back there when it was about the water I mean about you the the speaking of the word that you didn't speak the word so now I'm not going to let you go in Promised Land you got to wait about 800 years and then you can take a little trip by there he did Joshua had to take them in would you see Christ in Moses that could actually remind god of what he said so which one is the greatest the atonement that was made literally you know of what God Said are the word of the one that told it I remind you of what I've tried to get you to see for many about 40 something years now what took care of Adam and Eve in the garden right before God made the atonement right is it click and read right what took care of him amen what took care of with Adam and Eve before God come in and made the atonement cuz God had done told them multiply and replenish the Earth that's right he could not change that right that's right are you listening we think Perfection would lay then where's your Perfection lay does it lay in the fact that you took up so many animals cuz if one animal was good why not give them two you know right right I mean one atones let me put two I get a double atonement just in case something goes wrong are you listening it wasn't just Moses standing there it was a word that's right that had wrote five books right A Man Called Moses if somebody made a requirement and you keep it you then it's dependent upon his word right right all right there's a law here in America that you cannot try a man twice for the same crime it's called double jeopardy every how you pronounce those big words amen and somebody triy to take you to court about something and the judge says you can't do it the law says you can't try him twice right the word had said it the word said in Genesis I put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman could it ever fail if that not come to P that's right so what is really the atonement that's God's word don't you think God will keep his word see I know now come on you got to make your tement we had to do it they had to do it Aaron had to go in once a year he had to do those but he was doing what Moses said but Moses was telling them what God Said see Moses here it was his words that made the atonement for the people that was the real Christ that was not just the spirit of Christ that was the real Christ right cuz I thought we believed that Christ was the Loos theophany word that come out of God in the beginning the son of God what about the words of a man how powerful are they that's right that's it that's right let me remind you of a man in our day the people kept asking him questions about marriage and divorce he said I got the scriptures he said it'll bust every Church in the in the world am quoting said Lord what can I do he said go up in the mountain I'm going talk to you a man right went into a mountain they had preach to seals and brought us the word The Ten Commandments had come down the message had come the seals had been broke the man said what can I do go up in the mountain and I talk to you he comes back off of thereon and he says because of Mis interpreted theology Y and this is a question in God's word not a question like a question but everybody questioned it the Pharisees questioned it in the scripture we just read in Matthew we started if you'll go back over it's a little bit back from where we read there in Matthew that's what they were talking to Jesus about Mar and divorce he said but I say unto you that's right tell them to go home as they are not do it again amen he brought us the word that's right so that would have been Christ standing there the brother random said that means you're taking the place of God he said yeah what could he say cuz he was right what could he answer cuz he was was Moses God no right was Christ in Moses right was brother brandom God no it was Christ in brother brandom right who forgave our sins only Christ can forgive sins that's right the atonement what is the atonement everything that we depend upon is based upon what some man say am right right right you and I are here tonight because of what somebody said some man do we believe it was God that's right or was it just the words of a man if it was the words of the man of a man we're still in our sins you wouldn't back there and I wouldn't back there to 2,000 years when Jesus Christ died so you don't know whether it's true or not right said Brother D well you don't what proof have you got the main proof that I've got that he died is it changed from the Beatitudes into the similitudes of a light right in our hearts and lives and that I can stand and look at people and they say brother Dale I've got a lot of problems I don't have much of an answer for you but we know a God that does so just hang onen cuz where AR you going amen come on I mean what else you going to do just hang on Amen Lord believe God cuz in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Amen and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us am right Moses was God to the people right that's right because the word came to Moses right didn't Jesus Jesus say you you're talking to me about these things that doesn't your own scriptural teaching say that you are that the word comes to come the children of God the prophets and the thing what about it right we look at the atonement but you can just go though he lay down Mak an atonement does that mean you're saved we believe in message yeah where's the similitude right oh my where's the likeness of the message come on when you know yourself in this message what it is is is 98% of the preachers beating the people over the head and scaring them to death and telling them they got to stay with them or they won't be saved oh no they don't preach it that way brother Dale well you're to listen that's right that's what gets me I stand up here and warn you and warn you about brothers and certain doctrines and and then some of you will start this talking and there comes their Doctrine right out of your mouth and me warning you not to listen to that see then when I say it like that you don't want me to listen to listen to all you want to but why don't you listen with open ears if I say something wrong right you let me say something wrong you let me make a wrong quote and outside somebody will be there after me said you missed it right here oh my which is the greatest the atonement are the words of the one who said make the atonement that's right I leave that with you think on these things what is perfection the Father the revealed word stand come on take on these sign be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect is that just a quote throw it in a bunch of scriptures or was it like what I was saying that even the publicans and things will do these things aren't you greater than they are if you want to be the children of your father if you want to be perfect father what the perfect one says is that right do what the one says that knows how to make us perfect cuz I'll state it again you can say there's none of us perfect if God says I am you talk to him I have no problem I know I'm not worth nothing I know what what you're looking at is a garbage can I'm the first to admit that but if God says I'm perfect you better say what he says are you're a liar right sorry cuz you see that's what I look back at you and you tell me God has forgiven me I see God Is Forgiven you well now I don't see how that could be because what you really done you done it against me and if you come tell me about it that's where them preachers are you watch them in the pull pit you watch people in the congregation they want that microphone to stay on where they can hear what that person's saying well I want to know what they praying about about and all you want to know what they done then you can run on garbage can your mouth about it that's why I close it off and well well I don't know how to pray till I know what to pray about oh my Lord that's about as th as that's din to Bro made off of Shadow a chicken that star today that's thinner that chicken was it they was killing over R was other night when they got to getting the
