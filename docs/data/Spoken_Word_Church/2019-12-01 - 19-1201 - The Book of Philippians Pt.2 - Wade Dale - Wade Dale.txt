========================================

all right let's go we're Olympians we work we're going to go through the book of Philippians here it's it's not a very long book but it's full of some really good nuggets and then we're going to start where we say revelation tremendous room we're gonna go revelations I think it was a revelation yeah okay go go go into the book of Revelation also so here we go Olympian student but in Revelation more than any change if they're there for being any consolation at welcome us go back remember this is a continuation of Paul writing a letter with Luke in 28 and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them and evident token of perdition but to you of salvation in that of God so he's talking about the two divisions far into you it is given on the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake I'm telling you you know you we were talking me and dad will come at something the other day you're really you don't have to call persecution on anybody because it will automatically come there's always because when Jesus walked on the earth I think he was this meat mile person sure he's a king of peace but you got to realize when he walked on the earth he said I didn't come to bring peace right I come to bring a division a sword in other words you gotta fight to get into this kingdom you got peace inside but you're gonna have to fight because jesus knew the outside man was going to have to fight foreign to you as given on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which you saw in me now Lane I thought my the conflict never worked Paul winning especially in his first convergent early conversion where were Paul when he was Paul the persecutor I mean poor lad a nice he had to have a real revelation to lay his hands on Paul because remember remember God told him in a vision see this coming to come into your house and you got lay hands on him in salute easy as he saw install so in my but anyway you see how the lecto brother Marcus wings denied after service us you know Germans earth are known to be staunch and real you know real arrogant and real hateful and I said but I finally met one oh god bless you man coming to them but I've met but to meet a German with the Holy Ghost is totally different look at his actions your German German no he's working on in yourself you can't do it that's why I'm telling you when you tell your testimony it's a testimony of what God's done it's not just what you do the real you wanted to do right the real human you wanted to do anyway with polity you see Paul having the same time claims which he saw in me and now here to be in me role Paul bless his heart that where he went he was either persecuted by the Christians at first I'm sure they were like hey Luna he's not the devil in God because remember brother Graham says believers can't find believers their holy ghost camp like the Holy Ghost so when the Holy Ghost in those Christian believers saw and felt the Holy Ghost in Paul then they had to come together whether Paul was he was a staunch Jew brother Ram City was the hook nose to you start you at first but he had Godhead remember pulse that I had forget all that gosh what he's writing to the Philippians look I I'm still having a conflict there but it's not actually with the Christians now it's with the people that were egos in the you know they stoned him they whipped him apply something they beat him they put him in prison what because he preaching the gospel not cuz he's persecuting the Christians the advantage to an IV when persecute the Christian it was the so-called Christian world to keep them it's always been that way Jesus had no problem with sinners none zero he had no problem with centers prostitutes and they even asked him said why does your master sit with these publicans and sinners and all these people and Jesus told and said look they need me in other words it's not that they didn't the Pharisees didn't even they didn't want me so they were there it's the separation there's the Bible that was between and you look in the Christian world or this you know Christian I don't say so-called Christian world Kalev trying their best I can do out there in the world but they're missing the mark they're missing it i watch the guys names john macarthur and he's a good preacher nominal preacher but i was looking on YouTube and it said should women preach or teach in the church and I thought I want to hear what they got to say about this but you know most people 67 percent of the people he read accepted women now as leaders in the church sixty something percent but nobody I never heard even a message believer lay it in the Bible like he laid it in about one he did an outstanding job but you got to remember though he heads back toward the Trinity he's got to follow son Holy Ghost baptism he's got the part that we have right he's got that wrong but not as far as women preaching and teaching in the church baby he lays it on the line he even lays it but where he goes back into civilization everywhere a woman comes into power the men get weaker because it's not the natural order of a kingdom of Genesis everywhere a woman comes into power he shows Cleopatra's surely for a while they were wonderful great you know people but then all of a sudden that fall was was horrible but yeah he brings it out I mean he did a good job teaching it but what I'm saying is he doesn't have all the pieces he's got the cow he's got the grass he's got the picture but the cows on the top of the tree and can't get to the grass so you picture from so but we don't we have it right that's what we're talk about today and starting them and coming about this revival that were that we're going to talk about it being a word revival you can't revive something in the that's wrong the devil can but you can't look in Christian the Christian world through Christian world God cannot revive anything that has error in it I'll read you the quotes from everything with brother Graham tells us that and it ought to be common sense how you're going to revise something that's wrong God can't revise something that's wrong but once you get you teaching right you get all the things right then God can what he can revive what's already revivals what's already inside of you being brought back down if there be any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill you might joy that ye be like-minded like him it's okay to be persecuted it's okay to be talked about having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than himself and that's where we get in trouble a lot of times I heard somebody the other day they talked about I I mean me I told them I said you know the slogan says there's no I in team this guy there's no team and I cuz he ain't got nothing but nobody but yourself out of this and all that so you have to be careful watch these people because that try your best to esteem others above yourself whether you whether they doesn't matter classes doesn't matter color doesn't matter where we came from there know that matter but it's what we're all one in Christ be a look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others you think well that's being a busybody that's been no he's not talking about things I phoned our watches and all let's know if there's a man like we've had two brothers come in here with brother Marcus preaching the way they preached and bringing the word like they're bringing it I don't want to know what they know I want more of what they got and then same way my brother Dale preaching today he comes in breaks a daily Mass so that's what Paul's saying he's he's not saying if you know you got a Cadillac I want to count around with your Cadillac and all the Bob that's coming you can't cover it look that's one of them ten suggestions I mean Commandments things we'll look at interest of others and that would be right you look on the interested what brother Marcus was preach and I had an interest in what he was saying I was interested in what he was saying same way we're brother Chris brother Dale whoever the preaching the true word all these brothers sent here okay but it's good to have fresh things you know it's good to have fresh fresh revelation fresh you we have to have fresh manna I stay another day when I went through the dam in seventy weeks down here and we get all that wheel chart and all that thing I couldn't remember none of that but it was fresh then but it's not fresh now but the way I brought it now was the way it should have been brought and then we're going to just leave it alone cuz it's all archived and you can read it somewhere and it's stuck down there somewhere not here here this is where you process the truth it goes through here but you process it with them in oh man all it says the inner man is where your strength comes from not Turkey you got to have your brain but it stops filtered down here look not every man on his own things so here we go it's not that we covet because the Bible tells us in the Ten Commandments not to cut it so we're not coveting and you know we're not supposed to steal but I like stealing other people sermon Haeju brother asked me that one time see no way you didn't steal people's sermons I said I still AM every Sunday never wins do that great I steal brother branham's out 1157 sermon by state law I taped but what do you just say the kingdom was taking about what force so we take it but we put it here how-to up here if we put it up here then we do this right here we esteem ourselves better than other thing you can't do that not as a Christian right I mean you may start out that way but this is what this is for like just retreat II said you just got that patients run ten minutes that's having one patience with God because Paul look at verse 4 when we're talking look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others our interest of others let this mind be in you what this this mind be in you which also it was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery in other words he didn't take anything from God to become God he was God he was God so you guys see the same thing thing because if that might have a crisis in you that makes you Christ okay alright my brother Marcus was talking about that headstone I like that chart that he had up there that was good he's a studied man he's he's though he's a Holy Ghost field German who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God evil yes equal but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men so that's this time of the year that everybody says that Jesus was born oh you seen a paper today they found another really they found some wooden piece of something that was supposed to been in the manger so the Catholic Church is having this you know probably having this 50 million dollar parade that they're gonna parade it down through Jerusalem and put it into one of the whatever the mains they think you know there's like three different places they supposedly the manger was so I don't know which one they gonna put it in anyway that's relics and they called it a relic so I worry about relics I'm gonna be right here well if you they say that the art was met found on Mount Ararat or whatever that place was and they were still would there would which preserve preserving well they call it sacrifice that's most of us most of us to get older we're better like beautified yeah but wood petrified yeah some piece and you know what it's just Tennyson's somebody comes up with it found it in the closet really I mean come on is really they found it in the closet said well this must been part of the manger but supposedly listen then this company I'm trying to not be funny what happened was though in 650 ad which was 600 years left this was supposedly given to a pope when the Muslims started building the mosque of Omar and Israel they find this place or this piece of wood so they give it to Pope Theodore the first I think I don't want to have a Pope Theodore I don't think of Theodore in the Bible and then now the Catholic Church is giving it back to the Christians but you know I have the right of the paper told me this morning that there's only like 10% of Christians and they live in Jerusalem 10% the rest are Muslims and all different factions Islam or in Jerusalem and of course the Jews don't care they don't believe in nothing right so and so the Jews beloved that don't laugh they're blinded that's right 144,000 is somewhere inside that Middle East circle rub there even Iran Iraq in different places that are coming by but the Jews inside the city they really don't care and the good prophets are in there somewhere so you know they're there but you know what they're there because they're there dormant because we're still here they're laying there dormant because we're still here once we leave buddy they've only got three and a half years to get a hundred and forty-four thousand believers born-again no it's a melting pot no well everybody wants to be there cuz this even though they don't believe it that's the holiest place in the earth yeah yeah like Mecca is to the whoever that the Muhammad yeah like mecca of the muhammadans here's a list to the Christians but Christians don't go and reside there they go and visit in anyway because I think they just both doors cemented em just got back from that they go in October I think or november somewhere like that but he'll take 40 or 50 people over there and I'll just I just think I want to go over there reside there Saunders wait till the Millennium I won't have to fly back I will have to fly back would it stay there for all time then we're just going to be lifted up in another dimension God got a lot better off a brand new city down around the same place that's right yeah and you went when she called you and told you about it no okay yeah oh yeah okay let's get back Leon we got over a betrayal there for a minute all right but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant that's why I hope everybody realizes that to be to have the mind of Christ that's what he said right right then then to have the mind of Christ makes you a servant I serve it to water serve it to the center I serve it to the even the born-again I serve it to all while we're down here there's no great ones among us brother Graham said he doesn't know God's no respecter of person so we should be a respected person all right but being and was made in the likeness of men of course he was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross and I've been reading back through my Luke and done and the accountant just read them making my living done again and you see how Jesus brother Brown said and Jesus did fight it out on the cross he followed her down the garden gets then when he got out before that's where he fought her down he said father not my will but thy will be done he totally subjected himself knowing what was coming now he mean what was coming but that time he said my or is coming so that day he knew he was going to die because two days before that he said he sent as he was going to go up to Jerusalem and be betrayed and all this you know them that's when Peter said no that ain't gonna have Lord he said get behind me Satan continued you read the book of Mark where he goes to the Garden of Gethsemane in three times he goes and prays trying to get that off of him the burden he was again he was in his humanity he'd never seen that he never felt that he God never felt this and I didn't die but the human body that he was then died it died dead as a hammer brother Brent said laid cold in the grave all right but remember he'd come by and picked up by you up glorified it and now he's forevermore King potentate king of heaven or authority and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things let's see what things mean those under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord brother brown says everybody is going to have to confess that one way the other we confess it here we can own our knees and pray here and we confess that Jesus Christ is Lord but going there you get to the other when you get to the white throne judgment every knees gonna bow and every time that's that that man was sent to save the world and they turned me down collects the realization of they'll have it's that they turned it down that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and Finland in other words Paulo saying look I'm separated from you I'm not your salvation brother they don't not your salvation he helps you after you're safe he's not your salvation he said you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling then you come back and then we'll teach you like I was telling the church in Kentucky last week you know meaning all those beautiful girls that are sitting there fifteen sixteen year old girl with us said they were beautiful little children when they were born momma's did you put them in the closet or did you build them playing around them and put plaster over them and say that's the prettiest baby there was and come back 15 years later where you got no you got a nursery you got feed it you got to teach it same way with God when you're newborn babes in Christ you're just like a baby that's being born you're helpless you just know you're born you're breathing do you need help you cry that's why the Bible says we will see the spirit of adoption where we cry where about we cry and my father but now josh is not going to come back home with us tomorrow or tonight and getting Jim's lap he's pibe now and she's gonna rock him to sleep there's a problem with that if it happens it's not normal but why he's grown same way we're doing the Christian world we have to grow we have to grow up and God that's what this is this is the growth part of your Christian journey sure you're born again down here with faith but these things have got to be added just like you add kindergarten first grade second grade third grade fourth all the way up that's what Paul's talking about wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence what's Paul done he's birthed them I suppose she the Christ a chaste virgin right but now even in my absence you guys need to grow grow up you know that's why I said about many times we we try to get the preachers to save our kids and to say that's your part like if we're going to talk about this revival nothing brother Dale can do nothing I can do nothing God can do you say nothing yes he is a you are free moral agent there is nothing god I'll read you the quote from brother Graham saying God cannot start a revival he walks to Amen but you start to revive the revival is starting into start an individual brother man since then it works into the preaching I mean works into the church and it works into the preaching we're totally backwards from what we're used to we're used to offset in there you know and I'm just going to put this it's y'all it's not literal but you're sitting there numb brain you know because you don't know what's coming day you don't know what that will avail station to teach right so you're sitting there open you know you're sitting there you're not thinking about anything but now it's got to be a reversal you've got to start thinking about what you want that's right man you not start saying about what you you know why this role reversal that's what's going to get us out of here for 2,000 years we've been rolling in this direction all preachers say my children you know old Catholic Church you know say throw the water and throw the salt throw them preached you pray for my kids you know confessed no you confess the gun so now what we're gonna do is change it we're gonna have a little role reversal do where you're gonna have to start something yeah cuz I'll read you her brother Ram saves about 18 times listen they was 15 20 571 quotes revival and revived it being brother very messy I ready everyone and brother Brennaman all his talk he says God cannot start he wants to but he did not start one reliable man started the revival when they cried out for something is real for 400 years cried for a deliverer finally they got fed up and said hey we need somebody now so we know what we need a body change now when he died to come on the scene in the third Pole we need God to manifest the things that he said he might fit and it's not gonna be a public show so I'm gonna be healing lines that's what people think of robot oh listen I'm preaching my sermon forget again what you just heard as the prosecutor says forget what you just heard and we'll talk about this afternoon you come for a reliable yeah inside of you remind what you got no no that's not questions and answers as well yes you do you start to revival I'll explain to you sorry yes that's where it starts that's why it's gonna get a little testy maybe this afternoon but that's okay we need a stone guy start somewhere well my beloved as you have always obeyed listened not as in my presence all but now much more in my absence like I said before it's easy it's easy to live a Christian life right here you've got all Christians around him you've got wonderful aura of anointing and you've got the light here but take it out there Monday morning deliver all the time if you don't work online this way and I'll have a buggy I mean a truck full of them and I'll have it about two more hours that are going to my route that's when it gets the more much more in my absence work out your own salvation within family for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure we're going to look at this afternoon too you can't start a revival unless you've got something already side to you number of reps I didn't catch the center and brand the center took to a knowledge of sin but you can't call for a revival and not be born again oh you got called for going to save you first this is a whole different thinking than what we've been thinking you got a call you can't set that call for a revival and there's nothing in you to revive it just be playing if you're not born again you dead right that's called a resurrection that's not a reliable because remember that you know what we're resurrected sitting then we're resurrected when we're born again what we died buried resurrected then we can be revived or have a rebuy ball in our heart all right it may take a while to change our our old way of thinking but maybe that's what we need you know I think it is all up where it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure now listen don't be so narrow-minded you say well you're the one starts a revival remember what I said is the Holy Ghost inside of you that's calling for the revival but it's calling for it through you be not through the preaching it's calling it through the laity in the church you're calling for a rip listen Israel call for a long time I don't say 400 years but they call for a revival God sent it at the very end and he let him stay down there 430 years thirty years past the time and even Moses got caught up and had to go back in the wilderness for 40 more years before you deliver them so they waited a long time and I think we've waited 50 years now since the profits going go they thought though you had that revival back then now here I'm going preaching again stop that do all things without murmuring and disputing boy I wish we could handle that them that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation now boy brother Ram sedition was the most wicked age so you are you are that right there in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of truth just like a city living it without having without being in turns it's easy to live it here living it out there holding forth the word of life excuse me that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain we can all say that hey Paul I don't know I don't know Paul stood next in hey I'm the first Turkish messenger I don't know that he had that revelation but he knew that what he was saying was going to be written yeah I mean put in them you know ages ages could read it I believe God revealed that telling day hey this is going to be my written word and you're gonna write it down and we're gonna put it in the Bible all right I believe he knew that but now how it ended up he looked through a glass darkly he couldn't see everything like I said before Paul was dead thirty years before John went to Patmos and God revealed the sails to our showed him the seals Paul had nothing Paul didn't know about a wild horse rider read horse rider black horse rider and all that he didn't know anything about that but what he done though he preached the foundation one great prophet here like I said before one great prophet here one great prophet up there now we know our ranch in Martin but number remember Luther and Wesley weren't prophets now he'll call them prophets but there were reformers okay reformers but they had to be followed a reformer he was restoring China baggage he was restoring us back to what this foundation of faith okay then he got lost in the ages and God had to send another major prophet India time to turn us back to what here plus this right God puts blessing there remember them extra mile come forward and do two things one returns back to here and bring us up to here and then reveal the seven thunders for the seals that were contained that nobody had ever seen God had to hand over their eyes just like you did the Jews all right so we're gonna stop adversity extinct we're gonna go on it today we're gonna hold the temper things well it's 10:15 exactly so let's go up there
