to this liz they went to get tested today so we're gonna pray that that test this is the only time i like negative brother dale's a positive preacher he's a positive brother but i want him to be

brother that we baptized brother tony and sister astral thank you sister astra for being among all this crowd of guys and and holding and holding the banner holding the banner up for all the sisters that can't be here so i hope that they don't look at you a little different when they all get to come back like you did something they didn't get to do but uh i i i say again we need the we need the worship part i mean it's okay to sing a cappella and it's okay to have this one here and that but it's much better with a piano hitting it song leaders much better with a piano player that's what i thought so okay so anyway uh bro john duret um little john sounds like we're doing the cartwright family little john uh brother bob brother zach if i didn't call your name come on anyway um but those are the ones remember all like i said mom and dad went to have their test today so we're going to pray that it's negative remember all the people we're not the only ones everybody's getting attacked with it brother donnie and all the different ones they've completely shut their church down and at least we can come and do this and put the word out because because people still need to hear we still need to uh we're sheep we need our shepherd and man and we need a word which is the food the grass that we get to eat on in the field the fields out there and so for any of you that are at home please try to listen somewhere somehow get something until we can pray that this thing be over with i i we we never questioned god job in all of his we've not one person in this room come close to what he went through not one person and i said not even close to what he went through and he never he never blamed somebody else he he just went through it and he come out on the other side and you know what that's why god brought his attention to the devil because he knew that job would be an everlasting example for even now 4 000 years ago job lived or longer okay in one of the oldest books of the bible that was written here's job and we're still talking about him and marveling that he can stand up in the midst of boils all over his body his wife turning against him all of his children dead millionaire in this age would he he would be and he had to sit on a nice sheep and listen to three of his friends complain about why he was why he was the way he was he was some kind of secret center or some kind of joke and you really done something have you really not cleaned your closet out lately you know but thank god for elihue that fourth man in the fire when he came when elihu came he said job stand right where you're at be quiet and listen to what i got to say and we know who that is that was christ through that gentleman talking to him said he was he was a young man and he spoke to job i just got finished reading the book of job and it's really uh you ought to go back and read it again with us going through the things that we've went through um here and we lost a pretty good friend uh close to us from gainesville that was june used to keep his kids he passed away today he's younger than me um with uh covid 19. it was tony hamilton he knew uh he went to school with debbie at north hall so so he um a christian man as far as nominal christian goes and a very good singer so he passed away today from this nasty virus so uh god bless you we still think we still don't think we know god's got a hedge around us god's only gonna allow things to happen i i'm still bringing this quote again from shalom where brother brown says when you've done all you can do just keep on waiting when you've done all you can do to stand then stand just stand how can i keep going on stand how am i gonna do it stand because listen if we can't believe in god in this hour who in the world are we going to believe in doctors don't know they got all kind of this and they got all kind of this it's like a ping pong ball this thing is and nobody's got any answer direct answer of what to do but we know one there's a bomb in gilead and that bomb something in that bomb that when you apply it you get better so thank god for that that we can look at that bomb in gilead you don't have to go to walmart and get it you don't have to go to no pharmacy to get it the only prescription you have is the gospel all right this is all you got right here and i think we're since we're coming down to the end time you know i think we're narrow this thing's narrowing down all the things we thought we couldn't do without we can do without so god i think god's preparing us and showing us that this is like brother dale said this may not be the uh the this isn't definitely not the squeeze come on people good grief i'm still driving when going to going to out and eat and no brother brown said physically bereft that's a little bit different uh sitting in line at drive through at mcdonald's for 15 minutes is not physically breath that's just real slow service okay i had to do that today so i just reminded everybody that but but when we look at these things but i i want to warn you uh brother dale's got a i want him here sunday because he says he's got a good sermon to give for all this that's going on so we we pray that he's had plenty of time to study so so he he may just uh we might have to get out of the way he may park the water and take us to the promised land uh but um but there is there is something for us to look at but please don't try to put i i and we are put we're canning stuff and we're putting stuff up because the food chain may go out you never know but there's a there's a guy that that um he's a friend of ours and and i think from listening to him i don't want you get caught up in this he's trying to figure out if he don't make the rapture he's going to make it through that tribulation period no no i don't put any hope on making it through the tribulation period i won't i'm getting out of here that my and i don't even have a hope you have an assurity when you have the baptism of the holy ghost you have an assurity that you will not go through the tribulation what a great thing i don't have a i don't have a backup or a second plan or uh maybe if i put enough gold up or maybe if i you know grow enough asparagus or whatever you know just saying that if you like asparagus that's fine i hate it but um it keeps from it reminds me of the the asparagus on uh veggietale so i just can't eat anything hardly i see them vegetable so it's like eating bob and all them people so anyway a little john knows one's on that don't you because you grew up on that didn't you so do my kids but um but just don't try to like brother brown said if you knew god was coming tomorrow now listen how profound this is if you knew god was coming tomorrow he said and you were planting potatoes he said go ahead and plant those now to me that's profound if you knew so what's he telling us to do be diligent press even up to the door of the moment christians will be diligent christians will not be high we might have to physically hide from somebody who knows but i'm not talking about us having to try to get around something or get away with something no no it's going to take everything you got to get us out of here everything you've got in here to get us out of here so god bless you we're going to talk about the feast of the lord we're going to review and then we're going to talk about the three great feasts that all males were required in israel to attend three of these seven feasts and they have a significance if we can get to them so god bless you pray for everybody it's a long list i start at night and i start with sister jill because that's the first thing i feel when i roll over in the bed i feel that and i start praying for sister jail then i pray for mom then i pray for dad brother donny brother ron spencer brother ron peterson i just keep going down the list and man it's getting long so we need to remember these people in our prayers we still need each other more than anything amen all right reach out to somebody hey look reach out to somebody if god put somebody on your heart send them a text send them an email call them on the phone do something if somebody's put on your heart just go ahead and go ahead and make that say hey how you doing maybe going through a rough time you know or maybe not maybe just want to say hey brother chris long said to tell everybody hey i talked to him yesterday he was calling to see how mom was and they're doing okay out there it's hitting the indian reservations really bad out there but it's not hitting them uh hardly at all so um uh just remember people like uh poor brother uh daryl ward he i think it was like 17 days that he was still having it he was coming out he was on the 18th day when brother chris talked to him but he said for 17 days he said i've sit in my house and been bothered by this thing 17 days so god bless you if you don't have it pray to god you don't get it all right let's go to the book of exodus 23 and this will be the three times the feast are in the year and then we're going to review all seven if that's all right and then we'll uh i think we're going to just to kind of tweak your interest we may uh we may uh either go back and do the uh timeline that we did many years ago about adam to the future home and we may do that or we may tell brother joe you know a lot of times our our sermon titles when you put some kind of mysterious something in the sermon title and then it's on youtube you get immediately you get 20 or 30 more hits so we might speak on the trail of the serpent guess how many that might get but we know one thing's for sure satan's still here but we know who he is and we're learning more of his tactics every day we know what that trail is we just got to be careful and not get on the same trail he does like that on god of the evil god of this evil ages brother bob that kind of what struck my mind is is there's people literally worshiping jesus christ today and worshiping the devil not the not the people out there with the with the what is it the six point star or whatever the the devil symbol is and all no that's not them they're they're uh god of this evil ages right here that trail runs right through every church every person you just got to remember and realize who he is and what he's up to and that's what the seals do it exposes the devil because it tells me of redemption as it as it tells me of redemption it exposes the devil and where does he go here stands a lamb and there goes the white horse rider that's what i want to see i want to see the tail end of the devil you know what that means he's going away from you amen resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's the greatest seal there ever there ever was you know resist the devil and he'll flee from you there's not a formula there's not ad this and that no just resist him just say no not today devil not today so let's bow our heads and pray before we get started dear lord thank you for the time that you've given us to be on this earth for whatever heartache and trial for whatever tribulation for whatever happiness for whatever joy for what everything lord we've been given lord we stand here today as a 60 year old man that's been through a long life some of it has been sorry but lord some of it's been filled with joy lord especially that that night that you gave me the baptism of the holy ghost lord what a joy that's been from now on now the trials and struggles have been real and the same but we've just been able to handle them lord and i pray each individual will look back on their life and realize where they did come from look at that journey that they were on and that they're still in now and how this is going to take us to a future home father we pray that you'd be with us now take care of the ones that are sick we pray that all these test results will come back negative and we pray that the light will shine in the dark place and lord we know it's you lord that's doing all this you are in complete control you're just allowing the devil to do things lord but we know you are the one that we turn to lord for everything we need father give us this day our daily bread be with us now and take care of us bless all the other churches lord that's getting hit by this thing lord there's a purpose behind it sometimes we don't know it but lord you gave us resolve and a resilience through your word it tells us that there's no weapon formed nothing can come from wherever we say china wherever they say it comes from there's no weapon that's formed that's going to harm us and lord we realize that now because we know that we are covered by your blood lord be with our pastor keep him safe lord bless your mom lord and take care of each one each family lord has been touched by any of this we pray that you just give us strength in jesus name we pray amen that's what we need we need strength so here we are now at the end of the feast we're coming to the end of the feast but there was three times a year that all males in israel were required to come to all right not everybody but all males all right so exodus 23 verse 14 says three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread now remember here you're going to see this it says unleavened bread remember passover is connected to that because i'm going to read you another scripture and it seems like that it might be a little different but it's not feast of unleavened bread thou shall eat unleavened bread seven days as i commanded then the time appointed of the month of bib or nissen first month for in it thou camest out from egypt and none shall appear before me empty now there's your key and the feast of harvest the first fruits of the labor now you say oh no that's the first fruit no it's not feast the first fruit that's feast of the harvest remember the feast of first fruit was when the first part came to maturity and the priest waved it but then there was a harvest in the feast of weeks or the feast of pentecost which was the wheat harvest because we're going to see here in a minute that'll prove it it doesn't contradict itself and the feast of harvest the first fruits of thy labors which thou has sown in the field and the feast have been gathering which is at the end of the year when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord god so it was required that they show up in these three feasts everybody that's in this room except sister esther would have had to win all three of those feasts all right now deuteronomy 16 this one is a little more plain it says three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of wheat now what is the feast of wheat feast of pentecost remember seven seven seven weeks you counted seven weeks and then there was a wheat harvest all right a feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles are in gathering when you gathered your crop for the last time and they shall not appear before the lord empty in other words you're not going to these feasts without bringing something with you all right every man shall give as he is able not everybody's the same position in the statue of a perfect man all right every man shall give as he is able according to the blessings of the lord thy god which he hath given thee you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word if you will pull the chart up please and we'll kind of go through all the feasts again and that way it'll kind of give you a little bit of refresher course and then we will be finished here tonight so we're talking about now the the first one was the feast of passover now remember we talked about the feast of passover and what was that it was when the lamb was killed it was put up for so many days and then they killed the lamb and they not only just killed it they took the blood and they applied it on the doorpost it was something that they had to do all right it was a passover because the death angel was going to pass that night and it didn't matter who you were prophet priest or king if you weren't under that blood of that passover lamb you died if you were the firstborn of israel or the firstborn of egypt all right so that's why we were we were looking at the implication of that that jesus christ was the passover lamb and he died and shed his blood and then you and i must accept that blood sacrifice amen now look the blood doesn't save you it's a liquid but the symbol behind the life that was in that blood see the life that was in the animal blood couldn't come back and take away anything it just died and went on into whatever you want to say because they have life they don't have a soul they have a life but god accepted that until he came himself to become the supreme sacrifice that that man that blood cell when it was broke in other words when the life went out of that blood cell it didn't just evaporate it had a purpose it was eternal the blood wasn't that's right the blood somewhere dried up and went down into the cracks of the earth and and gone but it's the symbol it's the life behind it we know what was behind that life it was eternal and that life not only could come in just one back on one person it started with 120 went to 3 000 and now there's millions all over the world some that's already in the sixth dimension that's waiting on us that are waiting for this thing to finish up but it had to start somewhere so it started with a passover you know i was thinking the other day that's mine in your first month of life also all that other life you had if god forgive you of that sin and put it into god and to see of god's forgetfulness you didn't have a life back then and thank god you didn't have a life back then because god can't see it now the devil might be able to but that begins your life or your year that's your first month of existence because before then you didn't exist oh yeah you were a soul and you took care of this thing and you took it out and you you dressed it up nice and took it to the bars and looked good for the women and and did your thing that didn't mean nothing but when you came to that sacrifice that night you accepted jesus christ as your savior and you accepted that he died and that life came back inside of you that started your life because you're what the bible says you're a new creation a new creature old things have passed away behold what all things become what new lord so that's what was happening to the israelites they have been in bondage just like me and you have been in bondage for whatever year you want to declare it oh brother wait i never oh please i heard 25 tapes when i was a kid that's really so what you were still in egypt you were still in bondage until you come to calvary to that passover and you said lord you did that for me because that's what the israelites did in symbolic now they said okay their messenger which remember the three important things of passover god sent them a prophet give them an angel to guide them and give them a lamb to die in their place if they didn't have any of them three because it took a profit to tell them what to do moses said look go put this over the doorpost amen and you couldn't just put it on one you did exactly what the prophet said you put it over the doorpost because they were getting ready to separate from egypt and so were you and remember they never went back that group of people never went back to egypt you should never go back to egypt during this journey you their journey when they left when they left egypt they just kept on going now so what they went 40 years in the wilderness so are me and you that's what a bunch of hard-headed i was going to say americans but not we're hardheaded anybody amen even christians so the passover a prophet comes on the scene tells them what to do an angel is there to guide them and a lamb to cover their sin because what happened when they started on their journey when they started on their journey what did they need they needed a day of atonement right they needed every so often to be reminded these are all reminders of israel of a natural happening and these should remind me and you of the things here we come to unleavened bread which is the day after we see the unleavened bread what is unleavened bread it was a seven day feast brother brown said type in the church ages to get the leaven out of your life during that time of unleavened bread and you could you had to get it out on the first day and you had to keep it out all the way through same way with your new birth even i started to do this but i'm not but you can type all these with justification sanctification baptism holy ghost says what is unleavened bread it's getting stuff asked the unclean spirit going out leaving you when you're not born again yet because you get born again in pentecost all right but you got to realize right here though when you come to here you got to realize that day that day at calvary when god died for you you got to keep remembering that that's right so that's what's happening all the way over in atonement when we get to that unleavened bread with a seven day feast it was when it was first of the seven day feast and what happened during that time you were to what you were to get all the leaven out of your life get all the leaven out of your house and eat unleavened bread for seven days all right so now first fruit and then we come to first fruits now remember first fruits was not a was not a harvest of wheat it was a harvest of barley remember that it was a harvest of barley this is the harvest of wheat this is the harvest of barley when the first barley heart when the first ears came to fruition are come to maturity then you wave that over and they collected up the barley but it was not the wheat harvest because jesus christ died on passover stayed in the grave what did he do in the day of unleavened bread he was down in hell telling them people that they had too much leaven but what did he do he picked up them that didn't have leaven abraham isaac jacob job picked him up and resurrected on what sunday because the feast of first fruits happens the day after the sabbath all right and then jesus did all three right there and they fell right in order on three consecutive days and there was jesus christ the first fruit but he was a barley harvest he was what he was a common man he was no beauty that we should desiring read isaiah 53. he was barley made lower than the angel actually made lower than us because he took our sin he took every sin you ever committed have you ever thought about that when he went to calvary he didn't just take mine and i know we always say no it was just mine no think about it peter james john he took every christian sin plus the sin of the world to that day at calvary for the passover and he said if you'll believe in me i'll give you eternal life so he'd give it to everybody that wanted it it's just that some did not want it some people decided to stay in egypt that's why you talk to people and you try to tell them and you try to talk to them about the word of god and it's like talking to that wall why it's like brother brown said no representation there's no re there's no in other words there's nowhere in their life that they're going to accept it see now that way god can move on i wondered why god put a man named adolf hitler in this world he knew he would be that evil and then to give him to say well i'll give you eternal life if you'll accept me and he would have given it to adolf hitler but he knew that man if he'd let him live 10 000 years see that's the omnipotence of god that's the all-knowing of god he knows exactly if he tries to give eternal life to these people out here they'll never in a billion years ever come to the day that they accept it that's right so therefore he can let an adolf hitler come on the earth and then live out his time and then whatever happened to him happened to him and he just goes on what a tragic thing this man wanted all power this man wanted to take over the world make a supreme race get rid of the jews he's burning he's in the fifth dimension right now sitting waiting for judgment but he thought he was the king of the world he tried to be but you and i own way more than that guy ever on earth you and i will will will we are recipients of everything that everybody brother john has fought for marco polo uh all these different napoleon they tried to conquer the world if you've got jesus christ in your life tonight you have conquered everything oh i want to hear it in the home somebody say glory because that's what it is why do we fight and it's not bad to have money it's not bad to try to do better but when he gets in the way of god when he gets in the way of god seek ye first the kingdom of heaven the problem with napoleon is that he didn't seek the kingdom of heaven first jesus come and he said i'll give you this kingdom i'm the king i don't need subjects down here to fight for me i'm going to have some of them that's coming on a little bit later and they're going to be meek and mild and they're going to be some of them are going to be fighters like peter some of them you're not going to hear much of some of them going to make a lot of noise but you know what when all this is over i'm going to sit on the throne and they're going to sit right there with me it doesn't matter if you're a gates or a uh um berkshire hathaway guy and warren buffett they're going to die and they're almost going but you and i are not here's the when we look at first fruits we got the whole field it's ours just take it and that's what i try to do on sunday that's why we we declare the resurrection when we come to church on sunday we don't just declare the resurrection 2000 years ago folks we declare the resurrection that happens in here we should have a perpetual feast day not 24 hour but the day of the lord as john was in is that all right so there's the feast of first fruit the first one to come to the maturity jesus christ come out of the grave and he said what all power in heaven earth has been given unto me but now what did he say he said now you go take what i got i'll be back in a few days i'll be back in a few weeks because see you come back in seven weeks and he didn't come with the people he came in the people that's the difference when we see the feast of pentecost to the feast of weeks we see that we come to a place that they count days you complete seven sabbaths but remember it's it's out of the seven day cycle or seven week cycle because it's seven sevens it's 49 and then the next day see that's where you see brother branham he picks up that eighth day holy convocation but then he takes it right back to all the to the feast of pentecost because you don't get born again under a seven you get born again and an eight and eight puts when you get born again you're eternal that is your eighth not a seven we are living in the day of the seven seven day cycle or seven week cycle but when you come to your day of pentecost which is 50 which is 7 7 just 49 so the first fruit the sunday after you see this happened on a sunday and this happened on a sunday jesus raised on the eighth day or the first day of the week everybody got that say amen all right so the same thing at the day of pentecost they were not born again under a seven they had one more day which made an eighth day a holy convocation that we see observed down here at tabernacles but it happens strangely at your new birth and then it's a wheat harvest remember that it's a wheat harvest you are so important to god he makes you wheat wheat's three times more expensive than barley is now i'm saying that's what he's done for us now see if you put yourself up there you got a problem let god put you up there remember what the bible says take the back seat if god wants you he'll bring you to the front seat amen so on the day of pentecost we see that we just got off of unleavened bread god said get that stuff out get that stuff that makes you rise up in anger amen but he turns that right around and on the day of pentecost he says you need to add some back because remember they use leaven all the time that was another question it was asked only on that seven day period did they have to get rid of the leaven and eat the little cracker the little matzah now after that seventh day they continued they had to add leaven when jesus was standing there giving out loaves and fishes he wasn't giving out crackers he was getting one time the bible says they were barley loaves and they were loaves not crackers so they added leaven back in they just at this point in time god wanted to say look and that's what you do every sunday you bring your 11 in you bring two types of 11. you bring your 11 which is sin and you're 11 which is what you're sitting in right now because you got to bring those two loaves as christ in the bride but christ was in flesh and now he's going to be in our flesh i have always said and i i have been through this message since i was a kid and they always beat on the flesh beat on the flesh beat on the women be on the flesh don't do this do that do this don't do that don't do that no right amen some of you didn't grow up through that but i know we did and they beat on the flesh and forgot about the soul get the soul turned around first amen and then there's nothing wrong with this leaven right here nothing wrong with it listen if there was something wrong with it god would give us something different when we got born again he wants us to win the battle with this right here remember not the picnic beast we need the combat bee and what's it it's in your soul working its way out and you are displaying it with this so when they bake the two loaves remember it wasn't baked in the in the uh temple can't do that now you can't put leaven in the temple but it was bacon in your habitation it was bacon in your house you baked the two loaves and you took them out and handed them to the priest now the priest i don't know whether he didn't know that was christ in the bride but it was an offering but in symbol it was christ that had to be in leaven when he stepped out of that tomb folks he was in leaven he was a loaf i am the bread of life and i'm not a real thin cracker i'm the bread that'll sustain you for all eternity and then they brought those two loaves and he said you know what i'm gonna have a second loaf because i'm not complete with just one loaf i'm going to have another loaf and you know what i'm going to do as i walked on the earth and flesh i go i'm going to have this bride that's going to walk in flesh on the earth and going to be wrapped up completely in leaven it's a secret folks the secret to this whole thing is is god living inside of you and you look no different now you understand what i mean we do look different or and we are different but standing in just an instant you look out in a crowd we all look the same but when you break us down in individuals and start talking about the word or not talking about the word or start using the sign language of the world instead of the sign language of the lord you know what i mean so there's your leaven that's what your leaven is going to display what's inside of you whatever it was added in your habitation when you cook it brother brown said you cook it in the oven of affliction when you cook it what happened to the three hebrew children who was the most preaching the other day they they well it's southern they hit that thing they hit that thing seven times and it killed the people that took him in there what it was that thing was so hot it burst their flesh before the other three even got there but what brought out that the three loaves the fourth loave in the fire amen the fourth loave in the fire he will be right here with you he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you so on the day of pentecost there was two loaves brought in because what happened was christ left the earth he took his leaven he couldn't stand there and say all power in heaven earth has been given unto me he was in a glorified body never could die again never could have a problem never could have a coronavirus amen and you know what he said he said now i'm going to come back and get in your loaf and i'm going to perfect that oh what a day of pentecost it ought to be a day every it shouldn't just be a day it should be every day that god used this loaf your loaf and he's gonna rapture your loaf and then you're going to see two loaves of bread in the millennium christ and his bride standing there in human flesh christ in a glorified body me and you in a glorified body cold equal amen that's what he said i i believe i sent romans he said uh uh joint heirs heirs and join heirs with christ so when christ stepped out of the tomb guess what we've got to come to that place all power oh all power and have a nurse been given to me no when he stepped out of that tomb he knew that something had changed his body had to yield to what was inside where at the beginning what was inside had to yield to the body doesn't that sound familiar doesn't that sound real familiar because that's what happened before you got born again but now that you're born again that thing inside is working on the outside and gives you a day of penta pentecost two loaves i love that christ didn't leave us out folks he's not left us out now god has not gone anywhere he's more close to us now than he ever has been because listen we do better under persecution you know why i've prayed more the past two weeks and i've prayed in a month if you hadn't then pray for me i just needed a little bit of prayer a little bit extra prayer uh push haven't we all haven't we all because we see situations right brother boyd's seeing one now we at home there with with one and we it it's all bringing it up and where do we depend on doctor god we depend on god there is no way we can make it without him so on the day of pentecost you know what peter said he said god he said this is that this is that that was promised by joel he got right into that old testament and brought it alive he said this is that which was spoken up that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh all loaves that'll accept him because truly folks i'm just going to say this one time if you're not born again you're cannon fodder you have no loaf you have no purpose and understand me i agree for people out there don't you but if you've accepted god he's put you in that loaf for a reason i love what brother brown said he he he took this one how many of you go back and look at the history of your life and see how in the world you even got here i'm talking physically physically got here yeah how'd you even make it to georgia well it's a fine place you know it is now but you realize your journey and how this one brother brown said this one was bred to this one and this one's bred to this one and this one and we just happened to pop up one day and god looked in the oven and there was a loaf well i think i'll call him bob no he knew you were coming he was just waiting on the right time i was reading today in the book of psalms this morning david said in continuation i was fashioned and in continuation in other words what this one come in this generation this one come in this generation inc i was fashioned lord i love that song i can't remember who sings i think it's um zach williams he says before my name was ever called on earth you already wrote it down in heaven before your mama and daddy ever called your sweet little name god already had called it in eternity if you're a child of his amen he knew your name before your parents even knew it so who's your real parent amen we were we listen we're changed in the image of that and like i said before i believe we were changed when you got born again that changed your soul into that 18 year old kid that god saw before the foundation worker brother brown said he put it in an album and he don't have to run over and go i think no he knows exactly who it is he's just waiting on you to realize it waiting on you to come to it i'm taking too long but this is to me this is good to me this is good when it gets down to where my loaf you talking about my loaf okay and you know sometimes god slices that loaf but you know what he does you know what you do when you slice loaf you hand it out amen that's what he wants you to do with your life god may slice that loaf and you think oh that hurt but there's a slice of bread that falls off and you might be able to hand it somebody and hand it to this person and hand it to that person lord cut me brother brown said one time share me lord you shared me one time you sheared me again what about a man that prayed for the sick by the millions and he watched his baby die he said god pulled the black sheep down in front of my eyes just because he didn't do what god told him to do but you know what he said it's all brother branham did you hold on your religion he said nope he said my religion held on to me and that's what it was that inside of the inside that's right it says the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord amen so pentecost complete seven sabbaths 49 days 50 days which was the eighth day and remember we were talking about uh circumcision when the circumcision happened on the eighth day and you and i were circumcised on the eighth day of our journey when we received the new birth all right so let's go down to trumpets because remember from pentecost to trumpets you're looking at you know your first three months basically and then you got about a three month what dry spell you got about a three month you got about a three year you may have even a third a year dry spell where you don't hear a whole lot from god but he's trying you to make sure that you know that you know that you know when you've done all you can do god i've applied to blood i've cleaned as much sin as i know of out of my life lord forgive me you come to the first fruits to where you know that you come to church you read your bible you study you press play when you want to not when you have to and then you come to that day of pentecost where you know something anchored in then guess what stand just like i said like brother brown said all you've done all you can do just stand right there if you're seeking the baptism of holy ghost you're gonna fight and fight and fight but you know what you're doing you're standing there what did ruth do you can't give yourself the holy ghost ruth couldn't do anything what did naomi say she said you go rest even boaz said uh you go rest it's my time to work let god fight our battles for us let's don't try to figure something out let him try to let him not try because he's never lost a battle he never went into a battle and lost one now we have and even the devil has but god's never went into the battle into a battle that he's lost so we come now to the feast of trumpets because what's going to happen and we think that sometimes it is silence in heaven for the space of not even a half hours but 30 years sometimes you know right sure if you've never been through a dry spell you're fixing to go through one that's right because everybody's going to go through that what wilderness journey uh-huh real dry and and ain't got nothing to eat and you think like you know you're the only one on the island and and the sand is all you got and a couple of trees and that's all but no god had his hand on that on the children of israel the whole time listen he was so much in the camp listen he was so much in the camp so much in your camp listen two million people got fed every day and watered 2 million not 2. he knew that 99 of them wasn't going to make it he fed him anyway he clothed them anyway same way on our journey folks i can see the children of israel going to these different ones and they look in these journeys and they what they do they murmured and complained all the time they sinned like 10 times but as they would get finished sinning you know they wanted well you know what this bread ain't enough we loathe this thing because every day we got to come pick it up every and if we hold any over oh it turns into wiggle worms and we can't eat it and but god give them enough on the sixth day he gave them a double portion to make it through the next day he had this thing written they plant them meals out in in them schools and and and they ain't nothing to what god done nothing two million people a day plus horses and camels and oh whatever else they took right and the water didn't just trickle out it's like five fire hydrants at one time because you ever seen a cow tea knows about cow cow drink 50 gallons of water in a day easy almost cause they'll suck you down what about a camel and two million people and they didn't have coca-colas and pop they didn't have dr peppers they didn't they had water that was sustaining life they had was what and god through your journey folks what are you saying by the way through our journey god's going to give you not what you want he's going to give you what you need because remember they couldn't hold over from one day the next somebody said well i'm going to gather a little bit extra because i might have a midnight snack god said no i didn't say that you're not gonna die your clothes are even getting new every day obviously they didn't have a weight gain issue like we do if it did their clothes just grew with them louise some kind of nylon i don't know but but you see what god did every day just like a bunch of kids what more that he knew they were going to not make it but he knows you're going to make it he knows whether you're going to make it or not if you're a child of god you're going to make it so he's right there giving you everything you need not everything you want but then all of a sudden about three and a half months later of this long journey drawn out silence we've come up now you know dad's been laboring for 50 years some of you been in the message that long some not doesn't matter it's just the labor and all of a sudden you're going to hear a trumpet and you're not going to hear a trumpet with an uncertain sound because because what did joshua and caleb they never got away from their first revelation everybody got that joshua and caleb never got away from their first revelation what about two men in two million unbelievers thinking think about you got a problem in three or four hundred people in your department or wherever it is you work or even three or four two million people and joshua and caleb said today we're more than able to take this thing and remember if you'll remember the reason that what this day right here the feast of weeks is one of the three is because remember that's the day the law was given 50 days after they left egypt at mount sinai god give them the law on the day of pentecost the day of pentecost amen so they had something to go by and they still hated it we'll do all brother dale says we'll do all moses said whatever god says that's what we'll do joshua and caleb's going now you ain't cause you can't see what we see what is joshua top of the baptism in the holy ghost right and caleb is the type of me and you he walked through 40 years of unbelief and he was like 80 years old when they got to that end and he said um didn't you give me that mountain 40 years ago didn't you give me that mountain didn't you give me a birthright to that mountain you in this church have a birthright to that mountain and if you can't claim it now like you did 40 years ago 40 days ago 40 minutes ago you're not a caleb caleb waited 40 years with them unbelievers and they're going joshua and caleb's going we good we're all right because see they got a revelation at the beginning of their journey that they were going to the promised land because they already got a little glimpse of it but remember them other 10 lion preachers is what kept them out oh my you ought to preach a certain oh i did so anyway feast of trumpets we'll get we'll get to this everybody all right what is a trumpet a trumpet is a message amen a trumpet is a message the feast of trumpets sounds a message and remember we read the scripture at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound there's a two part to even your journey you get born again under the trump what's the trump do you you're standing out in the crowd standing out there in the wilderness nothing going on maybe the birds chirping or the crickets chirping or the frogs chirping or whatever for frogs to do whatever they're doing frogs don't chirp i know that i just know about frog gigging i can't thought what's frogs do frogs frogs burp bee wait and all of a sudden what are you gonna do now you're not worried about you're not worried about like when our train goes by at the house i'm so used to it i never even looked but we were standing out yesterday talking to a technician from atnt and we were standing there talking and that guy hit that horn about not at my not at my crossing the one down there about a half a mile and he goes when he did i think he almost jumped in the bucket because he wasn't used to that sound but i was you know why because it was familiar if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound see it's scary but if it's just a if it's a if it's a sound that you know that's coming and and you know that it means something what does that trumpet mean in that instance it means danger don't come across this railroad track while i'm blowing this horn same way with god he wakes us up at the last trump the trump wakes you up inside right here to me the the feast of trumpets or your feast of your trumpet sounds right here because there's a trump that sounds and you say oh god that's for me you're talking to me you listen you got to hear something from somebody i don't care what it is you can't receive the baptism of the holy ghost without realizing you're lost and but realizing you're lost is not just you sitting under a pine tree half asleep no you come to a realization and something goes that's a sound i hadn't heard i've heard my hip hop i've heard my lionel richie john knows who i'm coming up line up come on now but you let but see that that's the familiar sound of the world but see that's unfamiliar now you turn that baby off where we used to luis was finding the up button turn that thing up let me hip hop a little bit more huh at the base base all right but you heard a gospel trumpet i'm being silly but you did you heard all these other sounds and noises and you were acquainted with that right you actually identified with a lot of those trumpet sounds but when you heard the trump that trump of god that says danny time for you to turn around time for you to listen to what i got to say because on the feast of the trumpets what happened it was coming up to the fall this is all your summer feasts this these feasts are all like i said before these feasts were now these feasts went on all year when jesus was here there was a lot of times he was in the tabernacle and on the feast of tabernacles but what he was involved in was right here he died at calvary he stayed dead the next day yeah he was dead his body was dead his soul wasn't yours is not either if you pass away and then he resurrected and then he came back in spirit form on the day of pentecost now what's these other three these other three have to be done by me and you or by something that's going to be at the not the harvest here but the last harvest i was reading the commentary just a few minutes ago the feast of tabernacles was a joyous feast but it also was a feast where you had to get ready for the planting of the next year because you gathered in all your harvests see there won't be one of us left that's why we're under the feast of tabernacles god is going to what harvest his bride and then he's going planting where to israel he's going right over there to open their eyes and plant over there to gather a harvest under the feast of tabernacles all right everybody okay so the feast of trump is good evening friends boy that that just you know what's coming afterwards it's not really that content a lot of people say good evening friends but when you heard that on the tape you knew something was coming or when you were in service which was none of us sitting here i think it was maybe about tony but when you were in service and he said good evening friends you really didn't really know what was going on but now we know that that trumpet makes a certain sound because you can hear it listen you can hear a gospel trump and it not be the message of the hour we don't explain that is everybody okay with that but you can't hear the last trumpet and not hear the message of the hour can't do that this is the last trumpet this is the last church age this was the last church age messenger and under her messenger you and i are to be the final voice the final trumpet to the final age amen so we're getting ready though for our fall feast because like i said before you've got harvest here barley wheat fruit you're coming to a fruit harvest god's not going to harvest your wheat he's done done that he's got your loaf he's going to physically take you out of here but by what the fruit that you bear that's right the fruit that you bear that's what he's going to take out of here it's not going to take luis yourego out of here no he's going to take what luis yourego has become because of what god has planted he's going to become that and that's what god is going to harvest listen we know one thing's for sure god's not coming back after you he's coming back after himself he's coming to get a part of him just like the armored meat packing guy he's coming back to get a part of him or he wouldn't be coming back he has decided that was his bride and the bride had decided that's my husband amen and he's coming back to get a part of himself and i love this part here on the feast of trumpets that there's two special silver trumpets announced that feast announced the sacrifice when the trumpet sounds the signal all the people who were within the sacrifice prostrate themselves stretch out flat face down on the ground two special silver trumpets the two witnesses are going to come on the scene because what they're going to do is they're going to sound a trumpet two witnesses they're going to sound a trumpet and what's he going to take them to the day of atonement not that christ is going to have to be killed again they're going to realize they're going to mourn the day of atonement is a day that you realize what happened and you realize that it either happened to you or it's happened somewhere else anybody good this is the first time the bible tells you to afflict your soul i say today afflict your soul what do you mean brother wade make sure you've got what you think you got make sure you got make sure that you know that you know that you know where brother wait how do i know stand right where you're at now that don't mean stand right here like that okay that means stand on what you got stand right there on what you got and say god i'd be like that man i said god if you don't give me the holy ghost you're gonna find a bag of bones right here in this one spot have you ever been that desperate you need to be that desperate somewhere in your life that your life has just went to i mean like the children of israel they just that god gave them quail they also paid for it you know why because it wasn't part of god's required plan his required plan was manna but they wanted something different they wanted to interject something else into the program now see that's our problem but you know what he'll allow us under permissive will he'll allow us to do that but look what it does about 20 something thousand of them died because there were serpents came out and bit them and they died why because it wasn't a part of god's required plan he said i am the bread of life he didn't say i'm the quail of life i mean really you just look you do what god said that's just and you say well that's do's and don'ts no it's really honest i don't go home and say go go home to jim cook lord i got to say i love you no there's a longing that if i don't see her i want to see her so bad don't you think god wants to see us so bad he's been so long in these feasts he's trying to get to israel but he's got to take me and you out of the way first all right so now also in the day of atonement we see that there's two goats brought in all right there's two goats brought in on the day of atonement and what one it flicks your soul then they take one goat and they kill it top of christ being killed for our sin and then not just being killed that day for our sin see because the scapegoat is not we know christ died in 2000 years ago at calvary for all the sins of the world but that didn't do away with all the sin of the world people just kept right on center but the scapegoat is the one i depend on that he takes that blood of that dead one and he carries it all the way into the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again that's the one i want because remember when you hit your knees and you say god i did that i know i did it and i know it was wrong and you know it was wrong please forgive me of that there goes the goat there goes the goat you got you got to see that that sin now has been carried away even through two thousand years of of heartache and trouble god had a bride a sinless spotless bride why because he took their sin as far as the east is from the west or as i say off into the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again the day of atonement on that day of atonement remember to israel's eyes will be open when the two trumpets sound the two silver trumpets sounds the message the message and then the 144 000 god releases their eyes so they can see remember he's got his hand over their eyes blinding them so that you and i can come in but see since when me and you i me you and i come in he has no reason to blind him anymore now he has another purpose he's got to go get them because there listen they are very important in this plan of redemption he said i'll never forget israel so he's not going to forget her listen boaz never forgot naomi never forgot her when she come to the very end they actually had a baby and handed it to naomi a type of what's going to happen to us we're going to take this jesus christ and we're going to hand it to israel through two witnesses and we're going to say here here's your salvation your eyes will be opened on the day of atonement and they're going to realize there in zechariah they realize that they had killed jesus christ 2 000 years ago so that day of atonement even our day of atonement we must always look back to calvary always look back to calvary because what does calvary do calvary gives you the two goats the one that died right there and the blood that keeps us covered brother brown said this world right now is covered with a small finger of blood all the way around and he said he don't see your sin he looks he hears your voice i say thank you too thank you for the atonement thank you that we come to a day that we realize that that atonement was eternal the bible talks about eternal redemption somebody read it the other day eternal redemption you know what eternal redemption is when we get to heaven jesus is going to have the scars still in his hands he's going to have the wound in his side and he's going to have footprint nails in his in his feet and he's going to that's going to be our eternal he's our eternal sacrifice he's going to let and you and i are going to walk around in a complete beautiful no cuts on us no blemishes and he's going to walk around for an eternity just to show see we'll come to that day of atonement you need to come to that day of atonement every once in a while yourself and do some checking up check up a little bit because you know what the very next feast is going to be a harvest the day of atonement's one day when we come to the feast of tabernacles it's a seven day feast and you have to go get boughs and you have to do a little bit of work you got to gather in what the fruit but i picked this up the other day i want you to see in john 1 14 don't don't pick it up just leave it right there in john 1 14 remember john said in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god then we always like to skip over to 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt look that word dwelt up that word dwelt john used that word dwell because it means to dwell in a tent you say well he dwelt among us no he dwelt in a tent called jesus christ now he dwells in your tent called whoever you whatever your name is all right so this fault this means that the fall feast is complete it's a seven day feast and they rest in booths for seven days they sit out there for seven days in the booth they make little bitty houses and they go sit in it and it reminds them that god give them tends to live in the wilderness and protected them for 40 years protected them for 40 years so he protected you for the same amount of time but now remember what is connected to this the feast of tabernacles if we are now feasting brother brown said under the feast of tabernacles we're feasting under a seven because it's a seven day feast but then remember where brother brown picks up the bible says on the eighth day is a holy convocation on the eighth day is when you are born again it's on the eighth day when you're circumcised it's on the eighth day when eternity begins so the feast of tabernacles see you and i are under the feast of tabernacles here but you and i are not under the feast of tabernacles as that is because you've separated from the world he's inside of you now because what does revelations 3 say i've been able to sit with my father on his throne and you are going to sit with me not on the throne the bible says in the throne look how intimate that is that's intimate so see israel can go out and sit in booths and they can say oh god protected us and and we're this is what they're saying now oh we're waiting for the messiah and we're the chosen people and those gentiles are dogs and here we are sitting today knowing that god is in your tabernacle he owns that loaf of bread he needs that loaf bro wait he yes he does he needs a body he's the head i'm just reading scripture he's the head we are the body he has no body on this earth today but our body and when we give him headship he is not it's not just us alone in this tabernacle we're sitting with him in his throne not on the throne in in the throne the throne room now is not over yonder with the holy of holies and all no that was done away with by more pure the bible says and perfect sacrifice so the feast of tabernacles it lets us realize to me it lets me realize that i'm still human but i'm eternal on the inside i am in a booth and i am feasting under the feast of tabernacles listening to the message of the hour listening to these brothers preach listening to testimonies from people what god's done in their life listening to all these things and it ain't crowded in my house there ain't three or four of us in there if he if he told me sister asked her if he told me i'm just dumb enough to believe that i can sit with him in his throne and they it's plenty of room you can be there and you can be there and you can be there but that's the symbol of what that feast of tabernacles is it's a seven day feast and then you go to the eighth day holy convocation look what happens when brother brown picked that up i want you to see how far that was we'll be finished in a few minutes how far that was because if we're feasting on the feast of tabernacles we're feasting still in the seventh church age right and that's got to go to the one week left for the jews that's got to go to the thousand years of millennial reign and you're still in the seven but you and i the day we got born again we stepped into the eight and all we're waiting on is the feast of tabernacles to end for you some have already laid their tabernacle down because they got too old or they something happened in their life who i don't know that's god's providence not mine but they're waiting on me and you because you know what they're not in their right to be booth what is there right to be booth the flesh they lived in on earth because that's their that's their possession that was something satan had a hold on he watched it die satan went to all the funerals and said but remember he can't even get i don't believe satan knows where the sixth dimension is oh hallelujah i hate he can't even touch it i don't think he knows where he's at that's right they just disappear brother gary they just disappear and satan's going i had him i had him here just a second ago i had him i'm just i just the way i believe i don't say satan ain't got nothing to do with that sixth dimension god put the believers in that dimension he put perfect love in that dimension and satan ain't got he can't even scratch the wall can't even peek over in there and see who she just don't know nothing about them people but you know what's gonna happen one day where'd you come from you didn't look that way when you went down that place right there your old body's laying down there it's rotten job it's dust paul peter you're dust hey we're more alive than you ever ever will be so you see what's coming that's what's coming that's a reality that when they step back in this dimension the devil is going to know he's in trouble because you know one thing's for sure death in your tabernacle is fixing to be destroyed and we're fixing to just take what satan has used all them years and bent us over made us ache where we didn't know we had a didn't know we had a muscle took all of our hair away but when they come back through that dimension he's going to have to shake his head because you know what he's not the daddy that took your picture he will not recognize you because he saw you when you were born in sin shaping iniquity but god looks back at that picture before the foundation of the world and he said that's what you're going to look like satan's going to go i shout out shut up you have no hold right over me anymore resist the devil and he'll flee from you tabernacles you say oh i hate this thing i'm in this old pest house yeah in the condition that it's in but you're going to live in what you've got for an eternity but it's going to be brought back young again and to me that's the great mystery that satan can't find it's where them people are now and what's fixing to happen when they come back across here because he's a spiritual guy he's a spiritual man remember he's the he's the second man to the god in spirituality amen he's the anointed cherub i made you perfect god said until iniquity was found in you so he's a spiritual man he's going to feel that and he's going to go where'd that come from and god's just over going he don't have to explain to him because you know what's going to explain it to him it's when them dead saints come out of that ground it's when they walk back in here in a glorified body and then me and you brother brown said death will crawl up your arm and you'll go because you know what that is that's devil that's not god that's the devil doing now and you just go i think that's what we're getting trained for now i think that's what we're getting he's give us warfare to train for this and i just feel that's what we're we're training for is that boy has death not ever been as close to now i want to ask all of you has death never been as close as it is now because we're looking at this thing and we know one thing like like tony hamilton he was okay a week ago dead today another person at uh josh um leo at school gone death is so close but what are we doing about it we're running off and going where's god no we're going to continue on as we can we're going to pray for everybody we can we're going to pray fervently and we're going to see him come through this and all in the feast of tabernacles because the first time this earth sees that feast culminate will be in the future home when it goes through the seven and when they step into the eighth day there's your future home brother brown when he preached that message he preached it a thousand years back this side of when it's going to happen what a prophet nobody knew much about the future future home right listen folks we grew up in the baptist church where they said heaven and earth will pass away that's exactly what the bible says right so boom and we're just gonna we're gonna be on a cloud you know even brother brown remember he said i'd go brother neville hey brother neville couldn't shake his hand because because you're just not really real you know you got your harp up there and you're sitting on a cloud they know what we were all brought up then we had a prophet come and say ah brother branham you've run out of your types he said now i got one more he said on the eighth day holy convocation he said that's past time that's not the millennium the millennium is not to us our home is the eighth day future home and it won't be future then it'll be the present day the present day place i'm gonna live not just a temporary dwelling like it was described in there so now let's go back to exodus just for a minute if you don't mind give me just a second the three feasts go away the very end brother joe thank you they do an excellent job back there three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year now remember all the males have to go be just about four minutes all right three times thou shalt keep a feast of me in the year thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread thou shall eat unleavened bread seven days as i commanded them the time of point of the month abib which is nissan for in that thou camest out from egypt and none shall appear before me empty and the feast of harvest the first fruits of thy labor which is the feast of weeks which is pentecost which thou has sown in thy field and the feast of end gathering which is what the feast of tabernacles which is at the end of the year when thou has gathered in thy labors out of the field three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord all right let's read the next one deuteronomy three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose and the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of weeks and the feast of tabernacles they shall not appear before the lord empty what have all three got in common number one it's a harvest okay all right now remember you say oh no unleavened bread but now remember your unleavened bread is heading toward the uh feast of first fruit feast of weeks is what wheat harvest and the feast of tabernacles fruit harvest that's why the the people the boys couldn't come to the tibet or couldn't come to israel or jerusalem empty-handed they all had to bring something that they planted in their field and it could be bananas oranges wheat during wheat harvest but you got it out of your field and you brought it to the lord as you were able some brought virtue some brought knowledge some brought temperance patience godliness brother kindness all the way up to the capstone now everybody's not going to bring the same but it's the fruit of your harvest is what you bring to god now what's the second thing and we'll be done what's the second thing that they all three have in common i'm gonna just wait a minute they are all seven day feast feast of unleavened breads how long seven day feast of weeks seven times seven but remember the feast of tabernacles was a seven day feast but every one of them has an eighth day involved every one of them you say oh no no feast of my love of bread remember you forgot passover what makes this an eight day feast oh wait a minute now feast of weeks seven sevens is 49 that extra day makes it an eight and the feast of tabernacles oh we know that is an eighth day holy convocation you all every time that you brought something you brought it into eternity you brought what you brought your fruit you were bringing it for a seven-day feast but you were there for eight days every man what head of the house the man the male nothing to say against the females but the man's the head of the house god's a man all right so in symbolics what do we do as christians not three times a year i hope you can church more than that but three times in the year they were supposed to bring what they had planted in their field took it in and brought it and they would go seven days and then they'd go one extra day proving there was an eternity proving that you and i are heading toward an eternity oh yeah we're already eternal in our soul but this thing is still in a seven we got to take the fruit that we harvest and we got to take it and step into that eighth day the holy convocation that every male was required every year and there's many times and i'll go and i'll not get into it if you want to look at the history of it many times jesus came up to many feasts and a lot of them were the one of the three feasts because remember on the feast of pentecost they stand to our feet and musicians come on the feast of pentecost is where they lost jesus well that was one of the that was one of the three feasts that the males had to come to and where did they find him they found him three days later but they had to go back to where he left him pentecost never went back and found him under justification sanctification of baptism and holy ghost they never made that three-day journey back brother brown said i read the quote to you brother brown said they lost him at the day of pentecost they never stepped in to the eighth day they stayed in that old seven day feast and you know what that's okay for the pentecostals of that day because that was the message that was the trumpet that was the trump that sounded but today that won't work today speaking in tongues shouting that's fine that's good that's okay but you got to go through justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost to receive the new birth that was kind of strange though seven feasts those three feasts that were required had a seven day period and then they had to step into one more day that's you and i we're required to bring what we have folks we're required to bring what we have and bring it what to the storehouse and what does that do that keeps us here for the eighth day now you skip a day or two it's not the eighth day i said what do you mean by the way well you know what run it through your head how many times you study read the bible like brother bob said you know what do you put in front of god brother brown said you can't wait for the doors to open to come to church and we just don't open them in the morning i'm just telling you what the bible says i'm just telling you what the bible says maybe that's why we have a lot of problems sometimes because we don't do what god tells us today oh what fruit are we bringing are we bringing it just at one feast and then not bringing it to all of them listen they were required all males in israel were required or they were cut off for the whole year they were required to come to them three feasts sunday morning sunday afternoon and wednesday let's sing a song before we get in trouble before we
