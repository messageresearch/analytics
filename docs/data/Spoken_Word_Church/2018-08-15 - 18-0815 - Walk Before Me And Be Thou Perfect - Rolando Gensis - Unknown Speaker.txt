Samuel Dale for the confidence that he had given me to stand behind this pulpit and I hope the Lord will meet our expectation this evening and please pray for me and as my English is limited and I pray that the Lord will help me to express what's in my heart and we have my the church in Kalbach City Philippines I bring greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let us open our Bible in the book of Genesis chapter 17 let us read just one verse and verse 1 it says and when Abraham Abraham was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect let us bow our heads there Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God for this opportunity that we can hear your word of eternal life Lord as we are going to talk about your word I pray that the Holy Spirit will come and anoint your word also I pray that you will use your humble servant Alleluia and you will hide me behind you and father God you do the the speaking Lord God circumcise my lips and my mind and my heart Alleluia and may the words that we are going to talk tonight Lord God will be a blessing to everyone Lord bless a bridge in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord Alleluia and I just want to talk about but just just simple things Alleluia and about the subject in the text that we read hallelujah walk before me and be thou perfect walk before me and be thou perfect or perfection by walking with God Alleluia now when we talk about perfection or the word perfect I know you you know it you understand it but for me hallelujah I always although I understand this word but I always go to dictionary what you know the some of the meaning Alleluia and it says ah perfect the meaning is having no mistakes or flaws completely correct or accurate but the third one is the one that I like is having all the qualities you want in that kind of person situation etc perfect Alleluia you have all the qualities you want in that kind of person or situation or a thing or Alleluia et cetera just like I know that I believe there are some of you here that know some woodworking there are some woodworkers that when they are making some projects that some of them are they're looking for the piece of wood that had some nuts and some defect on it hallelujah and for others maybe windy windy so what he is doing with the carpenter what what the carpenter is doing maybe other people will say oh that's a damaged hood or reject but for the carpenter who who has done there be division who as was the plan hallelujah what he is trying to make Alleluia what what is trying to portray in his mind for him although it is defective but for him it is the perfect one alia that he is looking hallelujah just like God when our government is recruiting young young ones for for soldiers Alleluia and in recruiting soldiers there are some qualifications to be met Alleluia and you need to perfectly fit for that qualification Alleluia because if you are not perfectly fit for that qualification you will not be accepted but it doesn't mean that when you are accepted that you know already the military tactics Alleluia you are perfect for that qualification but the government has to train you hallelujah we'll teach you will will shape you hallelujah in order for you to be a full-fledged soldier Alleluia now here in Genesis chapter 17 the text that we read hallelujah and Abraham called the father of faith father of faith it means he's our model he's our you know Alleluia a father of faith yet when we look on his life Alleluia there's a lot of yes a lot of mistakes Alleluia Flo's failures and even he don't be God although Paul said that after the dot after the blood of Jesus Christ was poured in in in Calvary Alleluia and God didn't see the mistakes of Abraham hallelujah win win God said about Abraham and he is pulled to write about what he saw Abraham God said and he started not at the promise of God through unbelief but was he was strong in faith hallelujah but brothers and sisters he got a lot of Alleluia failures hallelujah one time bar Burnham saying God would have could have killed Sarah at that moment when Sarah loved and doubted God Alleluia but for me it is a right for her to love because she was not the mother of faith Alleluia she was not the mother of faith but Abraham himself being the father of faith and he not the god oh my Alleluia you know if you if you read verses 15 to 18 after God said to Abraham Abraham walk with me Alleluia and build out perfect Alleluia and then verse 15 God said and God said unto Abraham as for Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall her name be and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her now Abraham you have already a son through Hagar but this time I will also give a son hallelujah through Sarah yay I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings people shall be of her you know what Abraham answered God hallelujah when the answer to God he said then Abraham fell at his face and laugh Alleluia and said unto his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old angel Sarah that is 90 years old bear would it be possible for a hundred years old for me hundred years old in Sarah ninety years old and when Sarah loved also he said can I have a son with my lord Abraham hidden her pleasure Olivia with the with the with the things that are what because I'm sorry Alleluia with the normal couple though Alleluia can can we have a son Alleluia so also Abraham did what Sarah did Alleluia and not only this he goes and says and Abraham said unto God all that Ishmael might live before thee hallelujah you know God Lord it seems the thing that you are talking about is impossible maybe you mean is mine Alleluia but the Lord said through Sara so it seems Ibrahim was doubting and not only sis but he he was really doubting Olivia what the Lord was saying you know in chapter 8 the 18 Elohim appeared to him in the plain of Mamre Alleluia and after that in verse in verse 20 dig up the body change and Bourbon hammy dramatized this data while Abraham and Sarah were walking down to gr and win-win Abraham looked upon Sarah and Sarah was Oh Sarah it seems you are getting beautiful I remember the first time I when we when we first get married Alleluia and Sarah said oh you're also getting handsome getting a young man hallelujah then then Abraham's in hallelujah we are in trouble if somebody will ask you just tell them we are I am your brother hallelujah just tell them hallelujah he made Sarah to life hallelujah he got a lot of failures got a lot of mistakes Alleluia but you know what God did say to to Abraham don't worry about him Alleluia I am The Almighty God just walk before me and be thou perfect Alleluia you can imagine brothers and sisters a father of faith a believer of 25 years old 25 years Alleluia and yet a lot of mistakes sometimes when you look too your brother and to your sister oh he has been a believer for a long time and yet he still can do these things I can't believe it hallelujah and maybe sometimes to yourself you discourage your your being discouraged hallelujah I got I still got this hallelujah this weaknesses I know but Barbara Hamm said as long as we are in this place he only we always have this stick in nature hallelujah Abraham in other words all that God was asking Abraham was just simply walk with Him Alleluia not to look him set himself his ups and downs but to see the Almighty God the I am who's like Abraham was not walking in I am The Almighty God hallelujah he can make the impossible possible hallelujah you know the nice things hallelujah what happened the next things is God breath a part of his name into Abram and suddenly his name was changed from a bruh Abram to Abraham hallelujah so just go ahead hallelujah and say I am not perfect not in myself hallelujah but just look hallelujah there is a perfect one Jesus Christ by just believing on what Jesus Christ did he is the only perfect one hallelujah now in Matthew chapter 5 verse 14 he says Jesus said says Jesus say be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect Alleluia in my humanistic mind hallelujah declares that this scripture is so ridiculous and seemingly impossible but my soul says amen you know God will not require from any person that although it is impossible for him to do it but I believe that when God require anything from any person he has a way hallelujah for him to do it I remember one time in when Jesus was preaching hallelujah in in the wilderness and the Bible said 5000 men just the man you know in every gathering the woman is always in majority Alleluia and the Bible said 5000 men so if there were 5000 men I believe the woman is more than 5000 so more than 10,000 how about if every couple they brought with them one one child or two children hallelujah so that was not only 5,000 10,000 or 15,000 more than that hallelujah and then the disciples came to Jesus and said you sent them Alleluia send him away let him buy big ones let bin die food and they were in the wilderness and Jesus was requiring them Alleluia telling them to feed them no no give him food all away so where are they going to get food maybe even though there were twenty corals building corals there or Shoney's hallelujah their food would not be enough for them hallelujah God was required and where was requiring them to feed the people Alleluia is so impossible for them to do that area but Jesus had away he will not require anything from any man if he didn't have a way to do it hallelujah so by two fishes and five loaves of bread hallelujah he feed them hallelujah and they were remaining baskets hallelujah still remaining they were still remaining bread hallelujah so I believe that are though this world is impossible for us to be done eliminate our lives made out perfect be thou a bidder for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect although it is impossible for our human mind but in our soul I believe hallelujah this is possible for us God has a way hallelujah for him to be done in us and furthermore the Bible says that as we walk in the light as he is in the light hallelujah we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin Alleluia cleanses us from some hallelujah from all sin so in when we say all is there something remaining nothing if there is no sin Alleluia what do you mean by that Alleluia so the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us from all sin the blood of Jesus Christ makes us perfect Alleluia so forget the mistakes Ilia forget the past forget the faults the failures the muck the mire and all the garbage in our lives forget them Alleluia and just keep on working as we walk in the light what means it is a constant hallelujah constant motion not walk today and then create for several months and then go to church hallelujah IPO if you want to go and then hallelujah you know in in the Philippines sometimes when I when I talked all the some people who were in the church before and now they don't go to church anymore how are you brother how are you sister oh yes by the grace of God we are we are still in the Lord we are continuing no brothers and sisters because the Bible says if we walk in the light if we are walking in the light as he is in the light we are fellowshiping one with another if you are not finished shipping one with another you are not walking in the light hallelujah so every service hallelujah you must come hallelujah if you are walking in the light and if we are filling shipping one with another bill is of benefit brothers and sisters Alleluia the blood of Jesus Christ is cleansing us cleansing us every time we come we are not we are not just praising God we're not just singing songs we're not just sick shaking hands with the brothers and with the sisters but there is something that is happening in us hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ is cleansing as cleansing us are we are we when we go out we we do this a little we do this and when we come Alleluia the blood of Jesus Christ take it the more Alleluia cleanses us from all unrighteousness you know even Paul Alleluia Paul who personally met Jesus Christ in the form of pillar of fire he was born again baptized with the Holy Ghost and he wrote Philippians chapter three verses 12 to 14 he says not as though I had already attained either we are already perfect but I follow after only I follow after he has been born again he has been baptized with the Holy Ghost he made the pillar of fire Alleluia but I follow after that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do and we are forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus Alleluia so you need to look forward how God sees you through the perfect sacrifice and he is the only blameless hallelujah Burhan all resist he always mentioned is that looking retro red is white hallelujah when a worshiper Alleluia he have done wrong in the Old Testament and then in his conscience he is a sinner he was a sinner then he will take a lamb and bring it to the brass in altar Alleluia where the priests are kills done the sacrifices every day and then when he got there the priest will not interrogate him will not investigate what kind of scene you have how often you know it how did you do it why did you do it Alleluia and how many times you did it Alleluia he just standard Alleluia and the priest will examine the sacrifice hallelujah and when the sacrifice is accepted Alleluia then the priest will kill Olivia that that sacrifice and the worshiper will will identify himself with that sacrifice ladies hands upon that sacrifice hallelujah and then after that he will go home happy hallelujah the priest did not ask him anything about his sin he was not examined the president examine him the priest only examine the sacrifice hallelujah and God hallelujah he only examine hallelujah our perfect sacrifice Jesus Christ hallelujah and you know brothers and sisters although we have this you know we have this weaknesses we have every day we commit we die daily we box-like daily yet hallelujah in the mind of God he saw you're perfect before the foundation of the earth earlier the one that his he saw in his mind is a perfect one hallelujah just like in building a building you know in in my place it is a city yet it don't look like one look like a city you know for a long time that we don't have more maybe just two years two years ago that we had this we call it in in our in in the Visayas region the guys are no more hallelujah and then when we heard that the the gusano will be built in in cal by organ we are going to have this the mall although it is not that you know it is just an ordinary kind of mall and the people were happy and then the demolished the old market and then we saw those those materials that they were bringing to that to the to the to the side and then one day my children when they came from school they said oh the gusano is is so beautiful you know looks beautiful and then one one day I went to the city and because our our house is outside the city and when I got there the tarpaulin is only the tarpaulin is beautiful but Alleluia on the side there are some steel bars and posts and pile of dirt and Suns and gravel and the people are working day and night Alleluia but in the mind of the architect Alleluia it is already finished Alleluia but when we got there Alleluia a lot of work and they are working constantly working day and night day and night working day and night Alleluia until this time there is already a finished guys animal the Christian Brothers how about if de quit working Alleluia would there be a Gaisano no hallelujah God so your perfect how about if you will fit working hallelujah we should walk walk in the light Alleluia hallelujah now you are called to perfection hallelujah just like the example that Birmingham gave about the waterlily hallelujah that was drawn up by the Sun by the Sun hallelujah that Lily had done nothing where the lily comes from from dirty stinking fun hallelujah maybe people doesn't want Ortiz to step on the pan it is dirty yet God knows there is something in there hallelujah that Lily had done nothing Alleluia it was it is the Sun that's calling her out of that mud hallelujah Abraham it was not Abram that chose God it was God that chose Abraham hallelujah do you say you have not chosen me I have chosen you and ordained you hallelujah 1st Peter chapter 2 verse 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous light hallelujah God has raised you up from that miry clay hallelujah to live in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you know if you will just meditate we have a song he brought me out from the miry clay he set my feet on the rock to stay can you imagine a man who is on Dada quicksand hallelujah in that situation hallelujah he cannot sleep because we need sleep he will hallelujah can i play down hallelujah and he was you know if when I was young me NASA when I was a boy I used to go with my father to do that to the rice field and some days there are rice field that the mud is up to here and we need this when you walk through that mud it is you know it's so tiring you know hallelujah and you can't rest you cannot sit hallelujah you know you cannot sit down you cannot you know imagine if you are on the condition for hallelujah for a lifetime hallelujah and you are searching for somewhere to rest and you can address hallelujah if you are going to lay down and they and have a plan to sleep and in the Mudville you know cover you hallelujah and then you are already tired hallelujah and one day there was a big hands hallelujah that pick you up from the miry clay hallelujah and put your owner up upon Allah and wash you hallelujah that's our condition we were in sin hallelujah you were tired in sin but by the grace of God hallelujah he called us out hallelujah from this world and in the Bible said hallelujah ah here in officience of thought over six and had raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah and if we are in Christ Jesus there's no more condemnation Alleluia Romans chapter eight verses 1 and 2 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit allelujah there is no condemnation maybe people is you know they are looking at you oh you are you know I know your past hallelujah I know who you were who you are hallelujah but in the sight of God hallelujah there is no more condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the Lord the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death Alleluia there's no more test hallelujah he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life Alleluia and shall not come into condemnation but had passed from death unto life Alleluia Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death and if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed hallelujah you know brothers and sisters the devil who enslave enslave you hallelujah got you in this mess in the first place I like what brother donating Regan and silliness in his preaching hallelujah that you're our first husband a drunkard and you know every time he come home he beat you hallelujah he didn't have money hidden up he's just a squatter you don't have a house he didn't have belong hallelujah he don't bring food he only bring disease sickness hallelujah but hallelujah when we were divorced from the old husband and we were married to Christ so our to the second husband he got life he got money he got blessing he got healing hallelujah he got split up stress of gold áliveá gets a burn and everything he got eternal life hallelujah you know that even hallelujah give us give you many names hallelujah he called you worthless he called you sinful he called you unclean and you know brothers and sisters even if you will what the unbelievers even though the his his his close friend before he will call his his friend he will he will curse you know you notice that when they were talking to each other cursing and curse you know Alleluia and we experience those things when we were an unbeliever but when we became a believer we didn't hear anything from cursing from from anybody Alleluia and God called yo brother called your sister hallelujah called you Saints Alleluia Jesus Christ he called you bribe hallelujah and this is the thing that the Lord had done to our lives Alleluia in the message the invisible union of the Bride of Christ he says he the bridegroom took away our shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness and the washing of the water by the washing of the water of the world and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water by the church no that don't sound right does it no you might find it in the Almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing up the water by the word in the word see hallelujah he took away our shame and put it on the sea of God's forgetfulness and he remember no more hallelujah you know what a wonderful thing what a hallelujah you know sometimes a human being that is so easy to forget easily to forget things especially win-win do Alleluia but when somebody I've done wrong to him you don't forget Alleluia a man who is finite Alleluia but to God who is infinite he knows from the beginning to the end he knows from eternity to eternity even the number of your hair he knows Alleluia but when it comes to our preview sing Alleluia he don't remember no more hallelujah remember no more by the washing of the water by the word Alleluia then he says you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now Alleluia you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning as we go up there in just a minute you are standing if you are standing on God's Word and with God's Word every amen every jot every title where you stand I'm trying to tell you pull away from them from them shucks and get out here in the width where you can get right before the Sun I heard the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah then he says you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the Son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the Spirit of God and was in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never seen that the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah so forget the past keep walking with God in the light of his revolt revealed word toward your son coming body change hallelujah now in John chapter 14 verses 1 to 3 says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also Alleluia what is he doing I'll go and prepare a place for you Alleluia to take you out of this best house and deliver you into my father's house take you out of this old earthly pest house Alleluia you know brothers and sisters even though you have everything you have the money Alleluia as long as you are in this body this body is always gives you problem the more you live longer Alleluia the more you get older Alleluia no more you got you get you have trouble when you hit 50 hallelujah then problem starts sometimes you can hear clearly hallelujah you can see clearly pains in the body starts Alleluia your knee and sometimes there are people that I I saw not taking medicine and put a lot of medicine here and then hallelujah but brothers and sisters this is a best house hallelujah he go to prepare a perfect place for you where there is no evil no sickness no old AIDS hallelujah no death no sorrow no hungry no pain hallelujah it's a perfect place calling you to the perfection Alleluia and you have hallelujah to be perfect to get there hallelujah that's why Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect Alleluia it is a perfect kingdom so it must be a perfect people Alleluia to come but the Christian how could we be perfect how to be perfect now in the oldest in the Old Testament the worshiper could only be permit perfect through the washing of the waters of separation Alleluia in numbers chapter 19 from verse 1 to verse 4 he says and the Lord speak unto Moses and unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the lowest the Lord had come that saying speak unto the children of Israel that they bring the red heifer with a spot where in is no blemish and upon which never came yo hallelujah who is the perfect the one that will bring no the one that they are going to bring hallelujah the red hater Alleluia without spot without blemish it is a perfect sacrifice never came yo Alleluia you know in my play in my country we use care about tone you know tone to plow and token to pull a cart to carry the products at our farm Alleluia and you have to you know I I believe you you know this that you mean what's at the yoga it is a piece of Buddha this upended world but you know brothers and sister you cannot put a yoke upon that care about unless the caribou is named or somebody had influenced him hallelujah he's influenced by somebody but hallelujah the European in the Bible it signifies sin hallelujah that's why the one that God is asking requiring is the one that never came you not yet employees by anybody Alleluia not yet influenced by the world as Y all said be not equally together with the unbeliever Alleluia and then verse three says and he shall give her unto aliens or the priest that he may bring her for bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face so this is the type of Jesus Christ there is no sin Alleluia he was a he was a perfect sacrifice and he was killed outside the home outside Jerusalem Alleluia and he deserve the praise shall take up the upper blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times so there is a blood hallelujah that would be sprinkled in front of the tabernacle Alleluia seven times and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the red heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin so the flesh hallelujah will be burned and the ashes will be used as waters of separation for our purification obscene Alleluia so there is the flesh and there is the blood only not only the flesh but also the blood Alleluia and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh hallelujah the world and the flesh Alleluia and the blood the world which is the flesh Alleluia and blood and if you will notice brothers and sisters in verse four it says and the priest shall take up her blood with his finger not fingers Alleluia and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times because if the press will dip his fingers into the blood and we'll sprinkle seven times so there would be twenty stripes but there were only hallelujah seven Elyria stripes hallelujah oh now in front of the tabernacle where the people goes through under the blood Alleluia so it it is a pipe earlier there are semen bloods on the signatures ages Alleluia and verse 12 he says he shall purify himself we read on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself on the third day then the seventh day he shall not be clean whosoever touches that the body of any man that is dead and purify it not himself defile it the tabernacle of the Lord and that soul shall be cut off from Israel because the waters of separations separation was not upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him so if he will not be was within seven days that soul shall be cut off he cannot come into the congregation Alleluia he could not come he could not enter into the tabernacle and the tabernacle it is that choosing place of worship hallelujah it is a place prepared by God Alleluia and you cannot get there unless you are pleased by the waters of separation Alleluia and then unless you go through under the blood Alleluia and how a man could be defined it says whosoever touches that the body of any man that is dead and purified not himself defile 8 the tabernacle of the Lord whosoever touches the dead body and we know that in the Garden of Eden there were two trees hallelujah the woman was called the tree of death and Jesus Christ was called the Tree of Life Brennan said in Jehovah Jireh though he says Christ that tree that was in the Garden of Eden there were two trees in the Garden of Eden these two trees were sit there for a birth purpose if she was the tree of death if she was touched Alleluia and Christ was the Tree of Life now by the woman comes death by the man comes life hallelujah so if a man touches a dead body he would be defiled and anybody that came out from that tree of death the woman he is defiled that's why job says in in in in Jude chapter 14 verse 1 hallelujah a man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble we are all unclean Alleluia in juices can you get a cleansing out of an unclean no we are all unclean we are all defined that way that's why we need to be washed by the waters of separation Alleluia now in the Old Testament that is only a shadow that's only the type now when we adopt the flesh of the red heifer and the blood Alleluia but in the old day in in the New Testament official chapter 5 verse 26 says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word Aliyah we have the world hallelujah that makes us clean earlier that's why when we come to church we are not I can say we are not just praising the darkness just shaking hands with the brothers and sisters or singing or Alleluia we are being washed hallelujah something is happening the Lord is washing us by the word hallelujah and not only by the world not only by the ashes but by the blood Olivia and the life is in the blood the Spirit is in the blood Alleluia Ephesians 1:13 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed the word hallelujah ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise now here is the word and the blood hallelujah but not only just simply the word hallelujah second Peter chapter 1 verse 12 he says therefore I will not be negligent to put you're always in remembrance of these things though you know do you know them and be established in the present truth earlier not only he did not only say mr. BAE's interest but in present trust alleluia not the blood that was killed yesterday the blood of an animal that was killed yesterday you cannot sprinkle it today when you kill an animal yesterday hallelujah the blood of that animal would you know become hard and you cannot sprinkle it hallelujah only the fresh hallelujah the fresh blood hallelujah that's why the present truth Alleluia in the Garden of Eden the Word of God is three hallelujah God mentioned tree it was the Word of God in the Garden of Eden but in the time of Noah hallelujah you never heard about the tree there is another mission in the time of Noah hallelujah it was an ark and in the time of Moses maybe the people they saw lights will say oh we are we are here and we need to we need an art to cross this Red Sea hallelujah but God did not mention any ark although the artist the Word of God in the time of Noah there is another word and God has away hallelujah for them in the time of Moses hallelujah just like in the time of Jesus he said he was a pointing to gently but this hallelujah he was a burning light hallelujah and then gently pop this is I must decrease and he must increase and then Jesus said I am now the light of the world but before he was risen Alleluia he went to his throne he said ye are not the light Alleluia and then Alleluia even Peter win/win/win Apostle Paul came he acknowledged hallelujah and the present revelation that God had given to the poor he said that about the he was talking about the knowledge and the revelation that the Lord had given to Paul and even the Alleluia even he said that even the the weak or hallelujah they are learned would raise to understand what what the what the knowledge of God that he gave the pole he was acknowledged hallelujah because it was because the age of that usages ha ha ha da began Alleluia and then from from Paul and so and so on until loser Alleluia until Weasley until Pentecost Alleluia and up to the restoration of the world the present truth hallelujah that's why if we walk in the light as the light travels we need to walk with the light hallelujah not only that oh I yes I am a Christian but you need to work with the light the present truth as a Peter said hallelujah as we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another hallelujah so you need to work with the present day trust the fresh revelation of your day Alleluia and that's why burnham the Bible says that for where the carcass carcasses there the eagles gathered hallelujah not the animal animal that was dead several days ago earlier but the fresh alleluia alleluia and in the time of job it's only the word that can make us perfect as we as we walk in the light with the word hallelujah as he is in the light hallelujah Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect you know in the time of Job hallelujah he was a believer God is revealing him every day he he made a sacrifice he made sacrifice who told him to sacrifice there was no Bible at the time hallelujah but he was doing what God was revealing to him in his days hallelujah and even his his friends was accusing him and job he knows who he was hallelujah he
