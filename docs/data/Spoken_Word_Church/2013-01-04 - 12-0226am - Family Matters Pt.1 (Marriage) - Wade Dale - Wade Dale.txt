========================================

foreign things let's take it to heart amen right it's easy to look at somebody and say well I know what they done I know what they've done I know how they act it's easy to do that and Miss what's being said unless you get the people on the way the person and everything out of the way you know settle it down to one thing and just listen and then applied to our lives you know some of you are going to the uh you know the you know Dave Ramsey's thing appreciate all of that but you're not going there just for to be out of time or sit down you're going there to take something and take it to heart and listen and apply it because if you don't there's no need to go you're just wasting time so let's don't waste time in this series as we listen that way you can speak unto us and give us the word of the Lord as to family and life and living and doing in church one of the things or what we're supposed to be husband wife Etc because We Believe it'll be right in the word right amen so let's listen that away attentively and then apply it to our lives he said well if he will I will or she will I will well that's never been nothing to start with that's right all right never been to anything like that it ever worked my brother said he heard a man say one time the greatest thing he'd ever heard old farmer preacher done their wedding he said son he said it's easy to take a rope and put it across the barn in this big jacket you know you ain't getting nowhere so just lay your end down go around and take her in and Pull the Rope right off the barn everything will be all right well that was a good point had a lot of wisdom to his mind didn't you so let's just listen and tentative you know and intend to put it into practice what we hear and see how it will change our lives we think right okay so remember that remember brother Claude why singer will be with us Lord willing this coming Wednesday preaching for us and just keep him in your prayers the Lord we bless them traveling amen so let's say we Open the Eyes of My Heart and the way he comes to his ministering the word unto his estate I want to see don't put in the Eyes of My Heart I everything your power is Holy holy you want to see him I hope he didn't come to see me today I hope you came to see him for him to be an active participant in this service not just a bystander as we always say that because there's going to be bystanders to record what we're saying but we want God Almighty to be the active participant in the service and if you brought him with you then you must be the active participant in the service right all right there's not a separation right brother Richard there's no separation it's urine you ain't got in there together as personally amen you love the Lord amen well finally this is the Sunday I was going to fool all of you and wear blue jeans and a and a T-shirt and let you guess again but brother Chris got the Revelation and he decided to dress up he might be able to help me this afternoon so you got your Bibles let's go ahead and start I know the ones of you that were at the uh um my enrichment ceremony or Valentine's banquet that we had you kind of got a little snippet of what was gonna what I was going to bring but I want to kind of give you a just kind of a little background I had been thinking about this actually since about probably uh when we went to Kansas hunting kind of sitting on the deer stand you know thinking about things and thinking about life and and you know Dad's been through this many many times but we got a lot of new ones that maybe have not heard it and I surely am not gonna I'm not going to to go into the wisdom of it like he has because he's been around a lot longer than I have but maybe by now being married to the same woman for 32 years I've learned some things a lot of things and maybe we are able to since since our life has been full and Rich that maybe we can help you have your life make your life full and Rich because that you know God doesn't want us to be separate that's right we're going to find out and go through the scriptures that that God fully expected us to be man and woman amen what a surprise in the garden he actually separated us to have fellowship with each other husband and wife man and woman all right but there's institutions that come in of marriage and of things that I mean covenants that comes in and vows and we're just going to try to break that down and and read it now to First Peter 3 kind of First Peter 3 kind of covers from one to seven covers the whole a scope of of what we're going to be speaking on and and just bear with me and and bear with them in the back we got a lot of quotes and we got a lot of scripture so Tim asked me was I going to move around a little bit well maybe not so much because we're going to read what the prophet has to say and like Dad said this is not this honestly this was not done because of one person or one situation now I've been thinking about this since November and and just kind of run it over in my mind and and reading in that book of courtship and marriage and all that that brother put out in Canada and he just kind of sparked an interest to go back through and and just kind of go over because I'm going to read you quote in a minute where brother Branham says without without these primary primary yeah primer he calls them without these basic things you are not going to understand Heavenly things okay and I was telling them this week I said we don't want to we don't want to spiritualize this thing let's don't go up in the clouds clouds I know we're supposed to commune with the Lord I know the Lord's always with us but you see your life your wife and your family more than you see Jesus you live with your family come on Amen let's just be honest I get a visitation from God just every once in a while yeah but I got to go to home to my wife every day I gotta deal with problems in my family every day I gotta deal with problems in my life every day so you can think about Christ in the church if you want to but we got to get past this guy right here right here's where it starts right now we're gonna we're gonna take in and use some spiritual applications but but don't go off in the heavenlies no we got problems right here right you know brother Brown said one time or somebody made a quote then and sometimes we're so heavily minded or no earthly good and then we're so Earthly minded we're no heavily good so there must be a balance in there somewhere Laurie that we can live and be honorable and and you know we're going to find out some things maybe that you didn't know but this is the way we're gonna do it we're going to call it Family Matters not Family Matters Family Matters the Family Matters part one is going to be marriage part two will be roll of the male part three will be role of the female so we're gonna separate it part four is going to be family all right so we start in First Peter 3 verse one and while you read it in the uh King James version I'm going to read it in the in emphatic dog life because it brings out a few more things that uh maybe the the King James version does not so let's just think about natural lives will use some spiritual applications and we know this all goes to Christ in the church but if we can't live together as husband and wife nurture each other and grow as a family you can forget you can forget about being married to Christ right all right all right amen all right amen all right chapter three of First Peter let's pray before we start dear heavenly father we lord you know in our heart that we when we sat down last night it was a presence coming through that I hadn't felt in a long time I wanted to know if this was right and I think you confirmed it thank you Lord for our families thank you for our church family thank you for all the things you've done for us you've done so much for us even though we didn't want it to be done you just overflowed us with grace and mercy and and that's what we're going to try to not be so hard Lord and but we're going to see how that you instituted many things that we're supposed to do and and and it's not do's and don'ts but it's out of love and how love came together and brought us into the Garden of Eden and how that that Satan came in and separated us and Lord he's trying to do that again he's trying to separate the very Foundation of of marriage and vows and things on the earth Lord and Satan is so deluded and and perverted the things that we're supposed to hold most sacred and that's our lives and our families and our wives and our husbands and our children Lord and also our church family Lord made this series bring us all together and one is you as you were one Lord you and Christ one Lord may we all be one and the same you prayed that prayer in John 17 Lord that we may be one with you like you are with the father we pray now Lord that she would strengthen us give us the mind of Christ and the knowledge to be able to speak the words that you want spoken Lord to be an active participant Lord in this service not to be a bystander but Lord take over and have preeminence in all of our lives and our hearts bless us and be with us Lord that we not say anything that would hinder Spirit Lord not say anything that will hinder you father but that we will be obedient children and not bash their children and not want to change anymore and not want to to do the right thing Lord because you told us we were that if we weren't able to change that we were just Pastor children father that's a hard statement but it's the truth we want to be obedient children Lord to be changed into your image father bless us today Lord let us be better husbands and better wives let us be better children and better servants for you father we ask your blessings Lord and the people that are listening that they will listen attentively and and be Lord active participants also in the service Lord to give Glory To You Lord if we were at a ball game and our favorite team was winning we'd be shouting and and glory and and here we are with eternal life being spoken and we just sit and sleep father I pray that you just make us quick enough make us more alive Lord to you father not the things of the world father just give us of your Holy Spirit today bless us and keep us we love you in Jesus name amen all right chapter three I'm going to read the dog lot you just read along there my brother didn't walk by me the other day and said how in the world can you see this well it's kind of hard especially when your contacts are wet all right let's read first Peter 3 verse 1. in life manner let wives be subject to their own husbands so that if some are disobedient to the word they may without a word be gained through the conduct of their wives we're gonna re-quote them a minute you wise hold of hold a very sacred part in this whole thing having seen your conduct chased with fear are chased or clean whose decorations let it not be that external one of braiding of the hair and putting on of gold chains or wearing of apparel but decorate the hidden man of the heart amen with what is incorruptible a Meek and quiet Spirit which is very precious in the sight of God for thus formerly also those holy women who hoped in God adorned themselves being subject to their own husbands right as Sarah obeyed Abram Abraham calling him Lord whose children you are become doing good and not fearing any Terror in light manner now here's going to be our our Focus right here in Lake Manor husbands dwell according to knowledge with the female as the weaker vessel yeah bestowing honor as being also listen to the dog light as being also joint heirs of the gracious Gift of Life in order that your prayers may not be hindered have you ever read that before I know in the marriage enrichment we were you know I read that that's going to be the whole theme of this thing the underlying thing do you read that again in order verse one through seven if you do this your prayers will not be hindered but if you don't that your prayers be not hindered your conduct between each one of us hinders our prayers to God right you sure I get all to think no you don't no you don't I was thinking this morning you'll be seated you know we always make that quote we live below our privileges we live below our privileges well you know what we've been saying that for 40 years someday we're going to have to say we are now living our privileges man amen because if we don't and we keep saying that what are we going to do we're just saying a prophecy we're just prophesying right and that's going to put us in an early grade but there it says joint heirs and Peter join heirs see in the in the in the King James it just says being heirs but see join heirs because we're not doing heirs now husband has rule over the wife yeah everybody's Fanning so and I'm hot up here so you'll just have to bear link for a minute the first Peter 3 verse one through seven kind of brings everything together now let's look let's go to you're gonna have to get in your Bible though or you no you don't have to you can just you can read up here let's go to numbers 30 because everything starts with a vowel now marriage is a union between a man and a woman not a man and a man a woman right all right I hope we're totally beyond that but it starts with a promise or an oath or a vowel until death do you part now do we have to go back through that again I don't think so but in numbers 30 verse 2 it says if a man bow down to the Lord a swearing oath to bind his soul with a bind he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceeded out of proceedeth out of his mouth if a woman also battle into the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house and her Youth and the reason I'm reading this because we're going to get to that I'm gonna have to bring some things together and I was telling the brothers that backstage back stay up back there back in the thing that I'm going to read some quotes two or three times because we're going to pick certain things out because we're going to stay today with marriage amen then we're going to break it down to the role of the mail break it down to the role of the female and then bring it back together as a family so we're going to be using sometimes the same quotes and the same scripture because right here this proves that the father is the head of the child as long as that child is at home all right so if and her father if a woman also bow down to the Lord being in her father's house in her youth and her father hear her vow and her bond when she has bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace then all her mouth shall stand and everybody she has binded bound her soul shall stand but if her father disallows her in the day that he hear it not six months not six years brother Dale's already been through this so we don't have to go through this again not any of her about Harvard bonds for which she had bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed that's what I told you before as long as the the boy as long as the girl is at home you're their Holy Ghost amen amen you're their circumcision they they come under the circumcision of the household of the male but the females can't be circumcised right all right now let's go to Deuteronomy 23 these brothers got a boatload to do this morning so just bear with them all right listen to this thou shall not bring the higher of a or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow see how safer this thing is for even both these are Abominations to the Lord thy God thou shall not land upon archery what is our three interest right telling brother Donnie this yesterday you're not supposed to charge the interest to your brother Christian r Christian are real brother you're not supposed to charge the interest no brother Nursery habituals anything you not you're what you're supposed to do is lend them the money or give them the money and don't expect nothing in return use usury of anything that is land upon Nursery unto a stranger though we got to make a living you can charge interest praise the Lord unto the stranger that Mass Land upon archery but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend Upon Our stream that the Lord thy God May bless thee now here's a blessing that the Lord thy God May bless thee and all that thou setestime hand into the lamb whether that goes to possess it look at verse 21 when thou shalt bow a vow unto the Lord thy God Thou shalt not slap to pay it for the Lord thy God will surely require of thee and it will be sin in other words if you don't do it right there is that okay it'll be sin if you don't do it exactly all right now go to Ecclesiastes five for a dream coming through the multitude of business and a Fool's voice is known by multitude of words not about that when thou violence of violence did God defer not to pay it for he have no pleasure in food pay that witch thou has fouled amen better is then that thou shouldest not even make the bow in other words than to make the bow and not keep it right same way with the vow of marriage amen the bow of marriage is the same way when you vow a vow yes until death do us part amen all right now I know I'm not going to get into marriage and divorce so don't get all squirmy because I know a lot of us have not kept that battle but that's between you and the Lord and I'm just telling you in a marriage that you're in right now we've got to deal with just I'm going to deal with them here that's brother Dale's part of the deal with American divorce not mine not yet anyway but that seems to be not mine and you know what we all have problems I always have problems with that so that's what Dad said there's no there's no one person we're pointing out no no one group or no I just want us to see what marriage is and and what it can be more you say well I have a good marriage do you do you have a good marriage does that marriage convert over into your relationship with God that's it because remember if your marriage is not right your prayers will be hindered then you say you're Superman I don't care who you say you are you eat tall buildings in a single bounce yeah I don't care the Bible says your prayers will be hindered exactly if you can't live with your wife or your husband in holy matrimony amen as unto the Lord now some of you I'm not there's no finger pointing to some of you that know what your wives are not here some of your husbands are not here I'm sorry this I'm just going to read you what the prophet said and I'm going to read you what the Bible said okay I'm not against nobody I love every one of you you know you should know that by now and this is this is not this is not a uh you know Regina Arline bashing or you know she don't care if I use her name I'm not bashing people I just want us to to realize right you know I was looking up the quote Val every time well 99.9 of the time brother Brown used the word bound he went to that woman remember the woman that committed adultery with the man while her husband was in service there's about 87 times he uses that story he said that got so deep he said into the Gable part of her soul yeah you know what a Gable is on a house he said it got into the Gable part of her soul and she forgot about it right and nobody could bring it out no he said no psychiatrists he said no drug nothing was going to bring that out except the Holy Spirit went back in her life saw that she had been untrue to her vow but remember her husband was also but she had left that get so far back that's right you know like Aaron said you know you got things in your house you hadn't used for seven years well you shouldn't you don't need them if they've been there for seven years you never used them yeah but what you do you just keep pushing boxes on top of boxes right what had happened she had she had let that go for so long until it had went so far back into her soul yeah because she forgot about it really so the Holy Spirit brought him back out remember what happened though she said you got to go tell him well he'll divorce me well he'd done the same thing to you so they come together brother Brown said they came together and become a very happy couple amen why they confess sin unconfessed sin is why we're still here right exactly Amen brother I ain't confessing is why we're still here amen all right I want to see if we can dig some of that out let's go to the very origin of marriage Genesis 1. my favorite scripture because you Bow Wow you better keep that vowel now listen brother Brown now this is what he said I just looked at it back there and I didn't have time to run it off brother Brown said one time a foolish King in the Bible made a vow now the Bible don't say it was a foolish King but brother Brown said it was a foolish King remember he said the first thing comes through my door I'll sacrifice remember it was his daughter he said now listen guys he said don't be making no foolish valve if you know better and you vowed anyway you've committed iniquity and we're gonna get to that you committed iniquity God's not going to hold you if you tell 14 women you're going to marry him thank you but which one you gotta have one true and you can't have 14 nothing's gonna happen but that's foolishness to walk up and say we're brother now I promised 14 women on marry her marry them they're stupid sorry I don't use that word an office We're Not Gonna use it here that was foolish unless don't be foolish we bow about you better think about it amen and when you start up we start again to get to the family we're going to get into the young adults we're you Sisters You Remember You vow Val to that boy brother Brown says you're married right and that don't mean you can go off and live with them right no no no this is where that begins right here in the Pulpit all right we'll get all into all that and I found some quotes the other day that that that's really good but we'll get into that a little bit later God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them them have demand over the fish and see and follow the air cattle herb over every creeping thing that creepers upon the Earth right so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them that's what he wanted amen you women are not a mistake right you were in the plan all along amen right right you were not a mistake you actually were created to reproduce amen I didn't uh verse 28 can y'all pull 28 up if not I think I can just about quote it and be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth amen ask them do it that's right if you don't have it don't worry about it guys okay so why did he put us in this agreement to do to create or to procreate all right now we know it was supposed to be done by spoken word amen now let's go to Genesis 2 7. God didn't want us to stay in spirit by the fellowship with you want somebody to kill the ground because he says and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathing those noxles the Breath of Life a Man became a living soul God wasn't happy we just fellowshipping with Adam in spirit right right amen exactly good thing boy that would be great no this is what God wanted amen what do you think it is or not this is what God wanted God wanted to make a man with this right here on him right right and then put that that he wanted to fellowship with inside so he could talk to it all right now let's go to Genesis 2 18. and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone because remember God created man for what Fellowship amen but now then the one he created not lonely yeah and he needed Fellowship amen what he had something inside of him they wanted fellowship and the Lord God said it is not good if a man should be alone I will make him a help me we'll get into that in just a little bit and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and never found the air and brought them to Adam now I want you to keep this in your mind Adam had no fear whatsoever oh yeah on the face of this Earth amen he did not fear the leopard he did not fear the line right he did not fear the weather he did not fear tornadoes he did not fear earthquakes there was no fear in this man at this point in time exactly man he he plead Fellowship amen with the Almighty you said boy that's a long way out of the way I'll read you a quote in a minute and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast in the field family and brought him to Adam so there was communication to see what he would call and whatsoever Adam called him that was it right look at the authority and Adam gave names to all the cattle and follow the air and every beast of the field right but for Adam that wasn't found to help me for him right and the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rim which the Lord God had taken from man made him woman and brought her unto man that's right and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man right therefore shall a man leave leave his father and mother amen amen hello oh you parents say hallelujah therefore shall man leave his father and mother and shall cleave remember with that word cleave we'll look at in just a minute that word cleave in the in the translation that comes from English it's actually in the Hebrew it means glue g-l-u-e that's the word they use cleave in the Hebrew for the word cleave is glue right yeah therefore man shall leave his father mother and shall be glued that's right and through his wife and they shall be one flesh right now there's a lot of implications there you can go to where you know it talks about cleave because you can't come unclude go back to your mom and daddy you've got to stay glued to that wife and all the parents say hey man now look Adam didn't say she is now a lesser part of me and she is a separate person from me which all right hold on no she is actually a man given to Adam part of the man called a woman a man with a womb to reproduce himself right all right she shall be called woman her name wasn't even Eve her name was Adam right they were co-equal they were going there exactly together amen that's the first Covenant right all right because they're going to look at there's another there's a double Covenant got to come into this thing and that's why we're under the place we are now but still even in that single Covenant he wants you to get married yeah there's the first marriage vow right right Adam said and this is Adam Bowen Dave amen our woman this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh and he named her no I didn't he named her woman amen right right because she was taking out a man therefore shall a man leave his father mother shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh all right now put up quotes one and two this is Brother Brown called This is the first marriage vow invisible Union of the Bride 1965 . marriage was performed first and instituted in the Garden of Eden right now all the rest of this we're going to come back to this with the characteristics of the woman but let me read it because this is what Eve was entrusted with right we didn't change the characteristics of a woman right even after the fall a woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile a woman is trusted to that now now a woman was trusted with that right capital W we're talking about the one standing beside of that right a woman is trusted to that there's not a creature on earth like woman there's no female dog no female of any kind trusted with the character that a woman is Right a woman was not even in the beginning of the creation because God know that she would fall all other females could not commit adultery amen she is the only one that can commit adultery if she had been made like the original that would have been this complementary to God's great wisdom right exactly pretty strong see she was made of byproduct of a man not a lesser form that's right but because she was cast over in that side in other words the fall right she has also been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption amen here we can spiritualize a little bit that's the reason Christ had a bride that's right Christ didn't need redeeming right right the bride needs redeeming amen but through her will come Redemption right but because she was cast over in that side she had been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption she's got characters that must not be defiled right if she would marry them she is defiled for a lifetime well see now he did the same thing or when she become me woman did the same thing no matter how much she is Forgiven she can't be justified right I'll strike that in a little bit got a scripture on that in a few minutes she can be forgiven for her defilement absolutely but she cannot be justified in other words she can't say no I'm a virgin she's had four men sorry she's not a virgin she's had one man she's not a virgin right all right I'm sorry I'm just gonna be playing she can be forgiven you can be forgiven in your slate white clean but you'll never forget it right right not in this life anyway exactly that's what we're working on this life right here we'll get to heaven I promise you but let's work on this one down here first amen amen not a script on that a few minutes she can be forgiven for her defilement but she cannot be justified in this life right it's always weather notice now she's been given this she may be forgiven but not justified Amanda right in other words men and women you give up your virginity and it's life exactly finished can't get it back okay I'm gonna read your quote here in just a few minutes my brother's around him said it doesn't matter if you've been married 60 years if you've never had just one husband and one wife he said you're just as pure as the day you're a virgin amen exactly even though you've had relations for 60 years why because of this sacred wedding vow amen all right everybody okay amen now the first thing in the origin of marriage we saw now what God has done God has given man and woman to reproduce theirself that's right even before tax was involved right right spoken word that's what we got to come back to the spoken word all right which is the spiritual part which didn't happen but it was supposed to happen right that's what he's saying right here there's the battle the woman was given a a sacredness right that she was only supposed to be with Adam but Eve was found with committing adultery so that put her down in the Lesser form right all right but now just as God is going to restore everything else he's going to restore that right he's got to restore perfect Fellowship so God created us to what fellowship with him let's look at quote number three number three goal number three okay now let's read now they're okay they have a lot to do I give them about 10 pages of quote so fellowship with God through reconciliation every nation is trying to get an atomic bomb now over room power to say all nations will bow to my you can't do it but God laid down a program in the beginning how that man can have Fellowship one with another and we'll have to come to God's terms on it that's all in the beginning when man used to walk in the early age with God in the Garden of Eden when first when the first Man was created in the great Cathedrals Under The Palms he and his wife when the cool of the evening come along they came out and worshiped God had a perfect Fellowship God Longs for Fellowship he learned he yearns he wants people to speak with him to talk with him he said you might do one thing you might do this too much of that too much but there's one thing you won't overdo and that's prayer amen that's the way you fellowship with God you commune with God through prayer all right talking with him excuse me and also brothers and sisters you can raise it you can go on if you want to you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God Amen amen and got long fresh creature who he created in His image to fellowship with him wouldn't you love to have lived in that time when the Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to come down to the cool of the evening and talk with him and fellowship with them wouldn't that be marvelous we all would like to have that time now listen to this now I Believe by God's word I can prove to you that we can come right back on them turns again with God tonight not tomorrow not in glory not at the wedding supper he said tonight right straight back to that kind of Fellowship right so we established now let's go to Genesis 3 in the garden and there was no fear right they walked straight up to almighty God and spoke to him because there was nothing in their mind there was nothing that had muddled their mind up their their bodies were they were naked but had no problem they were covered with what we said before brother Brown said they were covered with the Holy Ghost Veil amen Satan got to that Holy Ghost Veil and made it to the lust Veil into that in a little while maybe tonight or this afternoon now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God and made he said unto woman you know Satan was having Fellowship but is it in the right kind you got to determine that you on every eat of every tree of the garden the woman said to the serpent shut up talk to my husband yeah that's what she should have said amen all the woman yes I always gotta say something hey man and a woman sitting in the serpent we may eat in the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God said You shall not eat a beat me to shall you touch it unless you die right all right she got up on her Pulpit probably said and the surface said another woman you shall not surely die one word not for God doesn't know the day that you eat their own then your eyes will be open and you shall be as God knowing Good and Evil and when the woman saw what what Satan was talking about the Revelation that he was bringing to her when she saw that the tree was good for food because listen sisters are more emotional sisters and more uh the easy to be deceived because you take your emotion every time right you do that's just the way you were made that's why the feminist part of Adam came out into woman or Eve and she had the emotional part and he said and listen and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes and treated me desired to make one wise she partook of what the serpent said and did he and gave also unto her husband with her and he didn't eat all right so you understand we didn't know what went on brotherdale just went through all that and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew they were naked and they sold big leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst trees in the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said Where Art Thou listen to this Fellowship broke right here he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid yeah that's right clear all right fear broke Fellowship that's right fear he said out no I wasn't afraid before before he walked right up to God not a problem he could hear God coming feel that anointing he walked right up to God but now what happened and I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hit myself amen no words the Lord said who told you that you were naked now brother Brown you know how he says because man because Adam should have said God I knew what I was doing but see it's not our nature right and the man said the woman thou gave us me and she gave me the tree and I didn't eat the Lord said unto the woman what is that that was done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat in other words they were passing the boat down the line yeah watch man Adam woman and the Beast all live together in Perfect Harmony without the devil right they had Fellowship right right there was no fear amen yeah there was no fear in that Fellowship that's right that's why in the New Testament you see where it says come boldly to the throne that's why we can get back right we can get back to God all right and it's okay to remember that these things are spiritually minded that we'll remember these things but still look how now that God's gonna have to deal with this and making another Covenant Covenant was man and woman God multiply and replenish the Earth yeah no nothing muddled up in there everything flowed just perfect right right but now what happens you bring fear in it and when you bring fear in you break Fellowship you tell me before you were born again when you were first married to your husband or your wife everybody has this fear of them not loving them are this fear of this happening or this fear of that happening what's Jesus when he comes back in the New Testament what's the first thing he said he walks right up he says fear not because the Fear Factor is coming up because you're human right just like he did in the garden hey he was the one standing in the garden talking to Adam man right so it wasn't any different when he came down here human flesh when the man walked up to him he said fear not well he saw that fear raising up in the people right and it was killing them because it what if it destroyed Fellowship if it destroyed Felicia because of fear how's it going to restore Fellowship doing away with fear right right because Adam said I was afraid so that broke fellowship and then instead of going well God it was all my fault I knew what I was doing no he said she did it so that broke Fellowship because Eve turns around and gets mad at Adam and she says hey no it wasn't that it was me it was him yeah the surfing so here they go they start passing the butt right Fellowship just starts pulling apart well Adam don't fellowship with animals no more separated but God thought so much of that marriage vow though and there was so much of God and Adam so he didn't want to throw Eve away because he was a part of him he remembered that vow he made he said we too shall be one flesh I actually like brother Brown said God would have had to kill Abraham because Sarah was part of Abraham right and they weren't literally a part of each other Adam and Eve were literally amen DNA wise bone of a bone flesh of Flesh amen all right but now tell me you say well well I married my wife and she wasn't part if you're born again you and your wife should have the same DNA if you're both born again right exactly right and when we get to heaven we're going to have the same DNA right so there's a lot of things you can say about that how close that gets to putting us back into the right order but we'll leave that for another time so now this let's go to Genesis three we got three let's do 14 through 17. so God says well I can't fellowship with you no more not like I used to Adam you can't fellowship with animals like you used to if you have done what you've done and you can't Fellowship either way much and the Lord God said unto the serpent because now has done this that are cursed above every candle right every beast of the field and upon your belly you'll go and thus shall you eat all the days of your life you know how I tell you about that the dust the serpent eats is this thing right here oh yeah that's what he's eating he's eating this dust right here this is what he's eating serpent don't eat dust and left this is what he eats right here but here's the promise in 15 to put it back together Genesis 3 15. is the entire Bible entire Bible written in one verse that's what it was written for yeah and I got another word to Adam you can't do it but I can't and I will put in in between thee and the woman talking about The Serpent and the woman that's right what is enmity division God started dividing it up but he begins after that to start putting it back together because enmity is division so God is saying this is the way it's going to have to be now there's got to be another Covenant entered in brother Brown calls it a double Covenant and I will put enmity between being the woman right and between thy seed and her seed so there's division between woman and animal it shall bruise thy hand and thou shall bruise his heel in other words it what it is the woman's seed amen all day long they don't kill him and that's what Satan's been doing see it says Thou shalt bruise his heel now in other words Satan is taking us down to the Grave but her seed the woman seed will bruise thy head who serpent he's going to kill that thing hit it in the head really but the serpent still got a little bit of hold because of what he's doing right here because see that woman was standing in verse 16 and had two seeds in her right the serpents the the Beast natural and Adam right so he couldn't kill her watch this until the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow here's your Covenant sister did you win it and I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and die conception yeah what is your sorrow you're unclean every 20 you know 28 days you're unclean so it might just that's just the way it is yeah all right I will greatly multiply that sorrow and by conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children in other words you're going to hurt it's going to be painful thank God men don't have to have them that's right amen amen but now look that's why God said a woman the way she was okay the way your hamster formed the way you were formed God didn't just have to redo the whole thing he made you right to start with right okay another woman he said I would break and multiplying my sorrow and my conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire this is the one that people don't like I love the women anyway and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee right that wasn't in the first Covenant right right that's not in the first code it was Adam and Eve together co-equal amen right join air that's why in First Peter if you'll read that's what the restoration is back to join heirs and the glory of the Lord right right remember we just read it in chapter in chapter 3 verse 7 of Peter until the woman he said I would greatly multiply I saw on that conception and sorrow you'll bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee he's not finished guys we got a part two right and to Adam he said because thou has hearkened and to the voice of thy wife and hath eaten of the tree of which I commanded you thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it curses the ground for thy sake and sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days of our life and it keeps going on to dust you go back to the dust because that's where you came from thus Thou Art that's the shall return what death so we come into a double Covenant now look this Covenant was not made out of hatred right God didn't hate that the woman did this because he knew she was gonna do it yeah he designed her so that she could do it because she didn't make her in the original creation now he didn't design her to make her do it right he knew she would do it therefore he made her where she could yeah all right anybody said because now has hearken of the voice of thy wife now God listen God had to bring this New Covenant in to restore Fellowship right right Fellowship was broke before this was this was just an act afterwards this is what God told him now you got a double Covenant the man is going to be a ruler over the wife right thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee all right there was a new coming up between man and woman now but I wrote it here it's not out of hatred because look what was the first Covenant the Old Testament we're going to spiritualize a little bit now okay yeah click click because we couldn't keep the Old Testament right right that was the first Covenant in other words you said one nice note we got a neighborhood now listen God give us do's and don'ts through the Old Testament right yeah right right that's where I started do this don't do that do this don't do that way come in with the Ten Commandments yeah I know it goes into Grace but we couldn't keep remember Paul said you can't keep the law you can't keep it the law was given because of your transgression why not because you couldn't do the do's and don'ts but he gave us the second Covenant the Grace Covenant that's what that is amen that's not that that's not that now man's supposed to have power and rulership over the woman and treat her like dirt no every time I look at my wife sorry most every time I look at my wife I think of Christ in the church I think of how I'm acting because as she acts toward me the Bible says what Christ is going to treat me like I treat her right now I told you we was going to get kind of we're going to get it man what are you men moving around now for you had your chest back a few minutes ago why are you moving around of course because as God treats you is how you treat your wife exactly but you look at the wife and that's how you honor her as the weaker vessel we're going to read scripture maybe later on we want to go a lot further than this but I want to read this quote number five so we keep we couldn't even keep the first Covenant God give us which would be by the law right then he come in with Abraham Covenant but that was still in the Old Testament but the only time we can live it is when God came in with what the death of the testator or a new testament amen right we had the Old Testament we couldn't live it right right now that we have the New Testament we can live the Old Testament because we got the what death of the testator and that testator now lives in us right all right now look marriage and divorce two Covenants now that closes the beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't so at the beginning we got another Covenant now notice it's another Covenant now there's a covenant for the product and the byproduct right right notice the fall trouble death to every creature of the creation amen and like we said before you go back to Romans eight the whole creation does what groans and travailed right they didn't do this we did so they're groaning looking at us what waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God just like Adam did in the beginning all right now now there is a covenant for the product and the byproduct notice the fall brought trouble death to every creature of the creation making a difference in all nature right now let us notice what Jesus said from the beginning it wasn't so remember they asked him the question now it is not so from it is now it is after the beginning right in other words afterwards now there's a double Covenant first was just the Covenant Adam and Eve was co-equal amen one man one woman now the woman sinned and what does she do that throw them off to death and God had to make a covenant by that another Covenant here it is right here in Genesis 3 16. he made another Covenant man now the world is to be repopulated not by the original creation of God like in the beginning not by the original be creation but my sex desire right now that takes care of the beginning doesn't it in the beginning there was only one man and one woman one male one female but when she crossed that line and brought this sin now the world is to be repopulated again by sex not by creation my sex see where the woman is at now but that's the way the world is populated today through women that's the reason Jesus had to come through the woman to bring it back to its original beginning again without sex desire he's virgin born but Hallelujah there will come a time where it won't be no more sex right but God shall call his children from the dust of the earth why'd you talk about Resurrection back like there was in the original not through any woman but through the molding of the clay of the cosmic line and the petroleum he will create again like he did Adam at the first time Jesus made this possible by God making himself a man and coming into the world so he could die through this woman now it's testing time by sin right all right everybody got that so that's the the two covenants the Covenant now is man is to have river ship over the the woman and she's supposed to now multiply and replenish the Earth by the way we all got here right which was bisexual desire all right now let's go to number six listen to this this is a good one foreign Spokane Washington 1962. listen to this I'm gonna read the whole thing it's your American privilege you say oh yeah if you're a lamb a lamb forfeits is right right he don't have but one thing wool and he forfeits that if you're a lamb you'll forfeit your American rights to serve God say I can dress the way I want to it's none of your business it's not me brother and sister it's the Bible God made a man and made him dress like a man made a woman to dress like a woman made them act different and made two covenants with them and everything else it's always been the LIE has come your Adam might let you get by with it but brother God won't because that's the word now you men sit around and do such things as that aren't you ashamed Brothers deacons men who say they're men of God act like that when that's just the first primer or primary when you go to school you go to what primary school why because you get one plus one equals two all right you get a foundation that's just the first primer lesson of it how can you go into deep things of Discerning the spirit and things like that if you don't even take the first thing now what he's talking about is is you keep going on down through here you got a woman that put on manicure makeup and stuff like that you know all the do's and don'ts of the message what he's saying is if you allow that to go on you're not even at the primary thing yeah everybody awake yeah okay that's the first primer lesson of it listen the most basic primer lesson in these matters is to understand that God has put us under a double Covenant that establishes the role of the male and female right last established male and female have different roles right all right if it had not been for the fall they'd had the same role they would have both been ruler over the Earth both would have been ruler over the creation but now what happened in the garden you say well that's brother Brown said see that's just complimentary to think God wouldn't know that or God wouldn't do that and use it for Redemption so that's what he's doing he's using it for Redemption all right because the only way you and I can get here on the earth the earth was cursed remember he didn't curse out of me cursed the Earth the Earth was cursed so we all had to be in the fog to have a savior to save us so we had to go down into that crust of the earth we are all of our bodies we're laying there in Genesis 3 when God said Adam cursed is the ground there we are this thing's cursed this thing comes first right right all right we got to live with this this is what this is what happened but God said through the woman I'll bring it back so see I don't I don't I do see the man and woman in different roles but when we get up younger it's not going to be Jim go fix me some lunch or or where's my life no it's like Brother Gary and I were talking you know he's he's got sister um Rebecca and Sister Margaret brother Brown hadn't made remember meeting and hope and brother Brown said well now Mika said hopeless jealous right you remember he said oh there's no jealousy over there and he said we'll walk arm and arm and never have to worry about any of that wine all the f e a r right is going to be gone that's our problem right now we feel that we're not doing the right thing which Godly fear is good but we fear that we're not doing the right thing we fear that our wife will get mad at us come on people we fear that we'll do something we should be in Godly reverence and godly fear but not fear like Adam was afraid exactly Adam was scared Adam was in the old saying says he was shaking in his boots if he had any boots he was shaking because he knew that he didn't when he felt that presence coming like he did before it felt different something felt wrong right something didn't feel right there was not a a connection same way as a sinner set in a congregation I've done it before yeah I used to be the Christmas and Easter guy here that wasn't a fellowship right it was a what a condemnation a fear right now see we're supposed to come boldly Before the Throne of Grace We're supposed to come into the sanctuary and even though we may be fearful of things we're not supposed to have that fear right if you got the holy ghost that should do away with the fear inside because you've got the holy ghost that Holy Ghost will lead you to the word right so don't have any fear in that right right then that fear has got to work its way out yeah don't worry about our feelings all right so now Satan has obviously done one thing he has deluded this fellowship and this honorable uh part of marriage because you see what's going on out in the world and how the divorce rates and all the things are going on because remember he's made it cheap he's made it easy oh I just put her away and give me another one yeah or I don't like the way she cooked or I like the way he cooked or I don't like see the fellowship now let's talk about our fellowship for just a minute and we'll then we'll uh get one more point in and then we'll stop for this evening because I want to stop at certain points because like Jim said she said you ought to just preach 15 minutes because that's all we're going to get that's true though you only get 15 minutes of whatever hour you've got you're only going to remember about 15 minutes unless you go back and listen to the thing all right so I went over 15 minutes but I'm gonna stop in about 15 minutes yeah somebody you'll get this 15 minutes yeah but Satan has polluted it so much to where even the fellowship between even us and our spouse and those of you that don't have a spouse here you know we're praying that's all I can say is we're praying we're praying we've added them to the list and we're praying right because you can't be truly one we're going to talk this afternoon about the relationship you know you always heard the story of Three's a crown not in the Christian relationship nope Free's not a crowd right brother Brown said you got to have a man woman and God without those three won't work sorry no matter how good you think your relationship is with your wife or your husband that's not here without God and that three I'll read what brother Brown said he's there's a lot there's something strong in there he says and I'm gonna read it but I'm just gonna let the prophet deal with it you deal it with it with him he said if you if you sit there and you dwell in it I'll read it tonight and this afternoon he said if you dwell with it and you allow it to happen in your home he said you're not even a Christian I told you I'm gonna find out whether you believe you'll profit or not okay reach it now look let's go back to Genesis 3 16. until the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow on thy conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children the thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over there now pull up court number seven marriage and divorce now notice after the beginning after the beginning After Time began right time to get a win after the fall back in that was eternity is over notice after that fall was made by Eve after the fall there would need to be another covenant made now this is going to stumble you but I'm going to give you scripture to prove that it's the truth now notice after the fall Jesus said God at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall now we're going beyond that the Covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there's another covenant made now she is no longer ruler with him right each must have a separate Covenant now that's we're going to break that out when we get finished with the marriage part today maybe we're going to break that out into the role of the male and the role of the female and bring it right down through scripture all right then we're going to put it back together as a family all right now go to First Corinthians 11 3. but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is a man and the head of Christ is God so there's your any way you want to put it that's the way it's got to come all right the head of the woman is the man now we're going to cover that you say well I'm not going to leave it this afternoon we're going to cover all the different things about honor and respect we're going to talk about reverence uh obeying see it's not a lot of times what we think brother Brandon was real hard on the women why he was speaking spiritually because he's trying to get the bride lined up as long as the women getting the women lined up in the world or in the Christianity he was trying to get the women lined up but he was trying to get the bride lined up amen that's what he was sent for right see brother Dale was sent to preach to this congregation to get the women lined up the men lined up and to get the bride but but he wasn't sent to get all the bride lined up amen right that's right my brother Brandon was set to get all the bride lined up right so see that's why he had to preach the way he did he was preaching to local congregations but he was talking right right brother then he was talking to the whole bride right the our Prophet talks to everybody right but he was trying to get this group to see that the woman was still part of the man God never said the woman wasn't part of the man right he just said this is what you've got to do and this is what you got to do right he never he never took Genesis 1 26 out right never said we're not going to be one flesh but he gave us different covenants to live under right but what he's trying to do is to see he's trying to get the woman of the world lined up because he was typing them with the bride same way with you and I right in this local assembly men and women get lined up guess what that's for the whole assembly right right what did I just read you that's your prayers right be not him group right right that's powerful that's powerful that if you don't do these certain simple primer things sisters you know one thing's for sure brother Brown said if you cut your hair put scissors to your hair God will not hear your prayer right except for your repentance right that's it so you sit there and pray all that that's just like that woman she had went to psychiatrists she had went to doctors she had been prayed for she was going crazy and nobody knew how brother Brown said I don't care said you can pour all over I I think I still got it back there he said lady we can pour gallons of oil on you you can go to the greatest psychiatrist in the world which you've been to most of them she said but that thing went back under the Gable part of your soul of what you did your husband way back when he was off in the war he said you have let that thing stay in there and said there is nothing he said the devil will always have a hold on that until you get rid of it right said lady we can pour gallons of oil on your head and pray until the day she died and to do her no good right you hear how God works God don't go past his word God won't go past his word right so you sisters you cut any of you cutting your hair today I don't care if you've got this much or or give me burn it off you've cut it right amen hello then God ain't listening you sit there and pray for your family you pray for anything you want to pray for God ain't listening to it right amen God ain't listening to that right but when you come back like that lady had to do he said lady go get your husband when you two make it right and they did he said they gave their hearts to God right there they both knelt down gave their heart to God and he lived a wonderful Christian Life confession right right so cut your hair forget about praying he said for yourself say God forgive me restore me back and then let me pray for my children then let me pray for my husband they'll let me pray for for whoever it is but listen well we're established here on the Earth you notice I got a big tablet I couldn't get it all on my little tablet I got one big life here I wrote myself a note said this this was established while we're here on the earth and this is just the way it is yeah and it is right let me read this to you a marriage covenant and every one of us he got married listen this the marriage covenant itself is based on the double Covenant God established with man and woman it is very clearly established it very clearly establishes the roles and responsibilities of both husband and wife look at the portion of this wedding ceremony that speaks of these scriptural roles and did y'all get it another joke with there we go so here's the marriage covenant this is what you hear most of the time in the wedding I did one where it was a little bit different but it was basically the same without have this woman to be thy wedded wife now this is the Bible to live together after God's ordinance and the holy estate of matrimony with that lover comfort her honor and keep her in sickness and in health and wrinkles and then sagging faces and no teeth and I read a quote last night where brother Brown said uh he said he said I look at the somebody was standing before him I use it on Netflix if somebody was standing for him getting married he said I thought you know Lord and oh he was praying afterward he said Lord you know in 30 years they're not gonna look like this in other words that's what he said 30 years they're not gonna look like that yeah he said what are they going to do now so he had the prayer he said Lord make them always see each other as the first day they were married amen all right will thou love her comfort her honor and keep her in sickness and in health forsaking all others right mother-in-laws father-in-laws sisters Brothers mommies and daddies even man forsake all others keep the only unto her as long as you both shall live and you're supposed to respond yes that's your vow right now listen to the woman though lit without have this man this come from Brother Brown this was from where he was marrying somebody well thou have this man to be thy wedding husband wedded husband to live together after God's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony see now you didn't put obey in his and put on her right but you're supposed to honor but wilt thou this is scriptural wilt thou obey him and serve him love honor and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all others keep thee only under him so long as you both shall live amen so it's your death do we part right now let's cover one more thing well that's not let's talk right there because this afternoon we're going to cover being married in his name and then bringing the things together the purpose for marriage which we'll get back into Fellowship but that's exactly what we must do look without obey him and serve him so we see that the double Covenant has come in keep your vowel your vow comes down into your marriage and you're supposed to live together just like this and sickness inhale right you're supposed to obey your husband and serve him now when's the only time you're not supposed to obey when it's not in the Lord when it's not in the Lord yeah and brother Brown said if your husband says hey go on to church or your wife says Hey going to church you know that's your life you know the Bible says that's good to do that because because you living the life in front of them being salty you'll pull them in all right but now if you're not my brother my my buddy's coming Wednesday night he said if you live a hound dog life you're a hound dog yeah you're not a lamb you're a hound dog so you live a hound dog life in front of your family like Daddy's always said and I agree hey you know I didn't I didn't want to act like somebody else's father I want to act like my father yeah you know I didn't want to act like the way some of the other people was acting I've told you many times before we our actions speak louder than our world so even the little things that we do at home with our husband and wife that are not believing we still got to believe form but we got to be so salty we got to be so reverent and even to them I mean they can just I mean they can just lash back at you look at the illustration of that brother Brown gave of that woman that gave her heart to the Lord her husband was drunk remember when she he'd come home and he said hey I want to show you well see he knew what she was going to do that man knew what that wife was gonna do he knew it he just didn't know he was going to get caught up in it and get saved but he was you know he was telling his buddy he said hey my wife she'll clean her ah your wife won't do that she'll throw you out the door remember he goes in and he slaps the eggs on the table and slaps him into the floor and him and his buddy will act like they were drunk and walked back out of the house and went back around and looked in the window and there she was my she's a happy birthday oh man just because what she did amen just because what yeah she you know what like most of us we might have picked it up but we were already going home now listen your sisters are not supposed to be a doormat and put up with stuff like that but she did and it won her husband and that man to Jesus Christ right didn't have to have a preacher in that she was her own sermon right there all right same way with you and I let's say Glory each one of us ought to be the same way right in our walk and our marriage and her fellowship with God and our fellowship with our wife and her husband but you know what if you know we need to live in harmony right we need to live in no fear brother Brown said he didn't he didn't uh in other words he didn't you know when he said his wife you know he'd go off somewhere and his wife would he was afraid she'd commit adultery or afraid that he would commit adultery and he said no he said he said I just love her amen right I just love her so she knows I won't do it and I know she won't mess right so same way with you and I as as couples we need to be able to to have a holy reverence for each other but don't fear each other if you go home fearing your husband or or you want you you need to come to the office if you go home fearing that your husband or wife is going to do something um you know to you or to to harm your relationship then then that's not the third person in this yeah all right you need to think you need to get God in there first vows marriage tonight we're going to talk about a little bit more about the relationship we'll get into Fellowship relationship I like that one and we're going to get into obey and honor and we we should be able to to get through with with the marriage part and then maybe start next week on the roll of the mail and then the role of the female so everybody enjoys it okay man you get some things that you really enjoy but I want to take it by the scripture I don't want you to listen to my opinion because because see I could sit down and say Brother Gary this is how I treat my wife he said well I don't treat mine that way I'll treat mine this way it's not that we're wrong we're just different but there is a basic truth that everybody's got to live by right amen the double Covenant is not that brother Richard can let his wife rule over him which is not true and then I can't no that's the double Covenant that we have to live under right we have to live under that Covenant and we'll read that brother Brown said and I read remember I read to you guys that when we went to the marriage thing if a woman gets out of her role what is she Antichrist that's an antichrist Spirit if a woman gets out of her role as being the female in the marriage so I told you we're gonna find out whether we really believe the prophet or not right let's say something 271s of course 271 in the fireball yeah I'm so glad Jesus I travel all the time yeah you love the Lord be part of the family but you got to realize your big family down here right gotta be family down here not instituting the family and we wouldn't have one God instituted the family to show what the spiritual family looks like glory and for us to live honor respect and obey our husband us we respect honor and obey God right right that's the institution coming down but we all have certain things that we that we're going to talk about maybe this afternoon as far as as fellowship and things like that with your with your with your spouse because I think one thing is and I know June and I have not done this because we don't have a lot of arguments we really don't we don't have one arguments maybe one or two of them a day or no probably one or two a month maybe maybe but she's she's good she's what God gave me and I'm happy with it all right but there's ways that you can handle things and you know I always always thought that this was a great thing to do and that's if you ever started in an argument with your spouse it's just bow your head and say let's pray that's it all that take all the boiling yeah that'll take all the what I'm going to say to him and what I'm going to say to her just bow your head and say Lord we're about to get into an argument and it's just different isn't I mean we're different people we're different we are different exactly sure and and I think I have a quote in here somewhere that that brother Brown said that he said you may have an opinion and your wife may have an opinion but when you come together I'm going to tell you pray before you do right pray before you start in an argument or anything you do just bow your head and just say honey let's pray about this before we start and then afterwards you know you want to throw pies at each other or plays whatever but but at least you that kind of settles it that warms it all up you know kind of settles all that sharpness we just need to quit being sharp with each other just you're always going to have differences you know we talk about the Dave Ramsey class you got you got free spirits and you got nerds we're free Spirits like to spend money and nerds like to save money well you need both of those in a marriage if you don't if you're free Spenders that's why a lot of you're in the class so one of you's got to become a nerd that what does the money crunching the dose thing you know writing it on the paper and accounting for everything but you know it's all one thing change that's right yeah we got to change right right we got to change we're not trying to change people to a Dave Ramsey mentality you know I'm just trying to help us get through life that's what this is going to do listen if you're not willing to change you're not going to it right right somebody told me the other day so brother they'll preached this several years ago and said it ain't done no good I said well you know maybe I'll try it one more time amen you know people still living the way they are well you know what yeah the Bible has a word for that iniquity it's no one to do good watch the first seal you want to know what first deal is it's a mystery of your iniquity right that's right not somebody else's exactly not the Devils God don't have any who's left iniquity right here is what's keeping me here right I mean no one to do better or knowing not to do something I go ahead and do it anyway that's why I'm still here so let's pray and we'll come back this afternoon dear heavenly father we pray that you just be with us Lord I know it's been kind of dry Lord but we pray that your spirit would come Among Us in a special way that you would touch our hearts and Lord it if we need change in the Lord just change it you said you would change our heart and make it soft you take that old Stony Heart Lord it doesn't want to change or doesn't want to do your will maybe Lord that you would just come in and soften that hard up father so that you can speak to us more Lord even the ones the Lord has been in the been filled with the Holy Ghost and and had the new birth for 30 40 years may still we realize that we need help from you father as we go through our natural married life the changes and the things that go on and the children and the life crisis and the things that we do Lord kind of does type our spiritual life that when we walk with you Lord on some days and and it's dark and dreary and then some days the Sun's shining but Lord you said through a little Prophet one time said a gloomy day doesn't mean that you're not with us and a break day doesn't mean that you're with us also we just got to believe like Lord before the fall when Adam was Fearless when Adam just stood up and and you walked up to him and spoke to him Lord just lift the ear and just commune with him Lord we desire that communion to come back together that we cannot be be fearful of of of not anything that that we're going to do wrong but Lord let's not be fearful that to come into your presence you said Lord through Peter for us to come boldly to the throne of grace to come up and and take the things that we need and Lord we see them in the end time that that we're supposed to do that as Sons and Daughters of God indeed adoption stage is where we're supposed to be able to stand Lord and and do his Adam and and move the clouds and and move the rain and and command this Earth again father we know that it's groaning and aching every earthquake and every every tidal wave is all showing that there's still a fall here but that you're trying Lord through nature nature is trying to get back to that spot where there's no fear although we pray that you'd be with the people and touch them and heal them give them Deliverance Lord and may they come go together as brother Brown said they're in marriage in divorce sin husbands and wives hugging and kissing each other Lord and living in the admonition of the Lord taking all the things away that of the trials and toils of life and just let us live Lord for the moment let us live for you father be with us take care of us Lord as we go and come back with you in a couple of hours Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed Lord bless you if we never really understand foreign foreign oh well I will bring in the rain
