[12:59] morning I like the way the Scriptures
[13:01] start off in the book of st. Matthew if
[13:03] you notice I started off where Jesus was
[13:06] speaking here they wanted to know how to
[13:08] prayer and Jesus told Jose do you pray
[13:10] after this matter he said a lot of which
[13:13] are in heaven how do we beat our name

[13:27] honey if you know that with Jesus prayer
[13:29] when he when the disciple took this
[13:31] prayer how did Jesus Hill he was older
[13:34] but he was not in them honey so we give
[13:37] to he go back to the 17-yard chapter
[13:39] Holly he was now he's saying he's
[13:42] speaking again he says now this keen of
[13:45] not coming it's already in you honey
[13:48] we're not looking for his kingdom of God
[13:49] we know it's already in us if I had a
[13:52] title this morning I'm going to use the
[13:56] full revelation is revealed on earth and
[14:00] full maturity is lived on earth how do
[14:03] you know what we've been in this message
[14:05] a long time how do you he's gotta be you

[14:09] we've been like here we had to grow up
[14:11] we we started other charities and we
[14:14] fighting each other and we try to do
[14:16] prove
[14:16] Revelator prudent you don't need to
[14:19] prove God hello God stand by your own
[14:21] word other so you know where so we begin
[14:24] to see us a becoming into food is a
[14:27] maturity in the Word of God so now we
[14:30] can take the scroll thing is a God
[14:32] so we not discard anymore I don't get
[14:34] you say well the world is falling apart
[14:36] that's the world but it ain't got
[14:38] nothing to do with you so I begin to
[14:41] look at these things right here now I'll
[14:43] just stop talking about the four
[14:44] revelation here is coming to a full
[14:48] maturity is coming to it's time it's
[14:51] time for us to get ready but what we

[17:17] brother I've been studying the message
[17:20] for years I've been looking in the buyer
[17:22] I've been trying to I've been living a
[17:24] good life one time we thought the
[17:26] message was wearing long sleeves and
[17:29] water and everybody were and everybody
[17:31] had to be dressed that's part of you
[17:33] ought to be holy but that ain't the

[17:44] you and preachers at that day they begin
[17:46] to become a screaming they begin to say
[17:48] if I'm in one time here I wonder my

[18:06] it here
[18:07] holiday daddy ain't got nothing to do
[18:08] with the front making a right but she
[18:10] that way that what people thought it was
[18:12] one time
[18:13] hey though it was a book of Ruth and
[18:15] then lower you live in a book a rule
[18:17] you're still under the law you ain't
[18:19] found Christ yet but you know notice
[18:23] that we want to look at how we get this
[18:25] revelation right one more scripture here
[18:27] different foundation I'm gonna speak on
[18:31] this fella right here because this guy
[18:33] right here was a religious man he was a
[18:36] not only he was a religious
[18:38] man he was a renowned man he was a
[18:39] people a man that everybody look up to
[18:42] and I'm gonna read st. John 3 about no
[18:44] one talked about Judah knows this guy
[18:48] right here this is a guy right here he
[18:50] ain't no word everything Madrid he
[18:51] dressed right Holly if you need somebody
[18:55] to come play for your baby in the heart
[18:57] bill he would have done that
[18:58] hallelujah done we're just got right
[18:59] here all his ducks in order I'll do but
[19:03] we are not trying to get you honey we're
[19:06] not trying to get you holida you know
[19:08] well you know we come to and we were
[19:11] taking her just with maturity
[19:12] if we were looking at all right this is
[19:15] a life that man was not smoking part of
[19:19] drinking but was he was a clean man he
[19:22] had a good testimony and he was a ruler
[19:24] in the sickness so we go to st. John the
[19:29] 3rd chapter beginning at the first verse
[19:32] and did everybody say that was a man of
[19:36] the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of
[19:40] the Jews how little got bigger yeah I
[19:43] lose I baby you brought one right here
[19:45] hey man it's me right here you told my
[19:47] man it's got no Moses but they didn't
[19:51] know the God that moves to preach maybe
[19:53] when they knew the goddamn modes of
[19:54] freedom whatever he was he would have
[19:56] cut where he was getting to it but it
[19:58] didn't movie he does no doubt he was
[20:00] looking at he could probably take the
[20:02] Bible in the Old Testament and tied you
[20:05] up
[20:07] he says her and in a in him what what he
[20:11] said and that was a man of the Pharisees
[20:14] named Nicodemus of the Jews this the
[20:17] same came to Jesus by night and said
[20:20] unto Him rabbi we know that thou art a
[20:23] teacher come from God for no man can do
[20:28] these miracles that I does except God be
[20:31] with him in a way you know where he was
[20:35] now how would you know he's he come to
[20:37] Jesus and he was acknowledging Jesus as
[20:39] a teacher but then why did he go to his
[20:43] teacher he went to his miracles so he
[20:47] never was that he would never employ
[20:51] his teaching he was influenced by his
[20:53] miracles so when he came to Jesus he was
[20:56] looking at what he saw the manifestation
[20:59] of the light now he said we know you are
[21:02] a teacher he was a teacher if he would
[21:07] have been finally cheated with a
[21:08] position he placed in the world huh but
[21:10] he was looking at miracles here so now
[21:12] would you know him look Jesus Oh Gina he
[21:15] was giving Jesus a compliment he thought
[21:18] you know you know people get excited
[21:21] about miracles I believe in miracles
[21:23] I've been praying for the sick if you'll
[21:24] believe it that part of it but don't let
[21:27] miracles they see because of a man can
[21:29] have miracles in his life and be going
[21:31] around running around come into judgment
[21:32] doing everything else how do you know
[21:34] that my brother and you preach the face
[21:35] repulses going with it he saw two
[21:38] preacher one I promised I wouldn't run
[21:40] to interpretate you one man was a
[21:41] genuine Bamboula
[21:42] or to go and none was a genuine devil so
[21:46] we look we cannot look at things like
[21:47] that
[21:48] we got to stay with the open word for
[21:50] this day so you go to here so Jesus
[21:55] watch that Jesus never quit
[21:56] Jesus never even acknowledged to come in
[21:59] you know if somebody go tell us right
[22:02] thank you brother yeah but Jesus said
[22:05] man ain't got nothing to do with it he
[22:08] said jesus knew that satan would be an
[22:10] impersonator and he would impersonate it
[22:12] with him gifts cuz he knew what jamming
[22:14] and jamming would did but you know where
[22:16] he was the word he knew all instant he
[22:18] knew that it was gonna be outpouring in
[22:20] miracle and then would the day the world
[22:22] will be deceived by hit up outpouring of
[22:25] miracle they never want you to be
[22:26] because they go see his miracles so he
[22:30] go to the says Jesus and Jesus said unto
[22:33] Him verily I say unto her Lee really I
[22:37] say unto thee except a man be born again
[22:40] he goes right to the new birth he goes
[22:46] right to the anywhere he say all they
[22:48] don't matter how they okay how much you
[22:50] scream I know how much you shot except a
[22:53] man be born again he cannot see the
[22:55] kingdom of God
[22:56] you all understand it at all so he will
[22:59] let you understand how will we get there
[23:01] ever we got to come to a new birth
[23:04] his new birth is the important thing
[23:06] here
[23:07] people say well hey it don't matter I've
[23:09] been a good person that is not the new
[23:10] birth that's not the new birth
[23:13] hello the new Barfield were you in Jesus
[23:15] Christ become the very revelation
[23:18] thank God persons are you that is your
[23:20] new birth so we begin to look here we
[23:23] begin to look at the place right
[23:25] because we don't know what it you know
[23:27] how we go understand what Jesus purposes
[23:30] how we going to say what was his purpose
[23:32] to come here hallelujah he didn't come
[23:34] here to show up how did it go fishing
[23:37] with you I need to go hunting with you
[23:39] how Luda said that he'll fish rise with

[32:26] begin to quote we were he there the
[32:29] anointing of God is upon me I know my
[32:34] position in the world
[32:35] Jesus himself he and he had to come to a
[32:39] baptism how do we receive the word
[32:45] well-pleaded well he's kept it there no
[32:49] need a God above me then he go right to
[32:52] the the desert the fruited he was a word
[32:56] he played with he realized to the devil
[32:59] to prove that the world is more powerful
[33:01] than quicker than any to end so he went
[33:03] to the desert of proof hell you could
[33:05] take the word and beat the devil any
[33:07] place anywhere anytime
[33:09] Hollywood you know your position so
[33:12] Jesus go down to the desert in the
[33:13] dermis come to it and it's greatest
[33:16] battle ad ever Holly we needed at his
[33:18] weakest point of life everybody got the
[33:21] wheat ports here I go do we what we look
[33:24] you know sometimes Melanie we lose loved
[33:26] ones great little people that we love
[33:28] people sure - sometimes separating you
[33:31] to such a weakened support and you
[33:33] that's - Pam didn't ever fight you -
[33:35] hardest but that time of your weakest
[33:37] point that's the time that God gave you
[33:38] more revelation nobody wanted to go do
[33:42] that but that's the time you get
[33:43] revelation that God proved it your son
[33:46] of God how do you let them he let the he
[33:48] get cut up the prudent yield son of God
[33:50] everything coming against you depression
[33:52] and every day they'll fight you
[33:54] your weakest part he was still standing
[33:56] on the Word of God how do you know when
[33:58] I've been sick for a long time and I've
[34:00] been praying how old to the Word of God
[34:02] honey you ready go down and faint then
[34:04] they go down and out so Jesus get down
[34:10] in the desert when he got so hungry and
[34:13] it got down then he was at its weakest
[34:16] point man boy you know when people get
[34:18] hungry they get crazy I'm gonna tell you
[34:22] right now you want to get a woman man
[34:23] and you let her get hungry I believe
[34:27] hello yeah you know you retry them down
[34:30] the road means I always get this
[34:31] attitude ain't stopping for a long time
[34:33] but that ain't gonna help me you're
[34:34] gonna watch it means you better enjoy
[34:38] driving by yourself
[34:41] and then women go let you know a
[34:43] rest I ain't waiting no longer already
[34:46] deep he said this way no no no get me
[34:50] some meat I'm tired of you been driving
[34:52] but Jesus that just weakest point when
[34:56] he was so weak you know it was been easy
[35:00] for Jesus he was it was God all he had
[35:04] to do is say let this mountain be come
[35:06] bring it man you told me he didn't want
[35:09] to cook bread with me again man in the
[35:11] world and you know you know what
[35:12] hallelujah
[35:13] let it be brand he would had all the
[35:14] bread he won't he could have picked up a
[35:16] stone said turn it into bread haloo he
[35:19] had the power to do it but if he
[35:21] would've did that then how would we have
[35:22] covered ears in the word we would have
[35:24] been looking at Mira because we wouldn't
[35:25] say I got to see a miracle before I
[35:27] bleed God he want you to see the word
[35:30] know where he was not trying to get you
[35:32] to see a miracle if we would have turn
[35:34] it into a stone into bread yeah we all
[35:36] would have been looking for miracles
[35:38] every time I try but I need to see a
[35:39] miracle how do you know he want you to
[35:42] see the word sadly so Jesus is saying to
[35:45] come to earth to Jesus if thou be the
[35:49] Son of God command that these stones be
[35:50] made bread
[35:51] hello Jesus ain't no ingénue and that
[35:54] Jesus had the authority to do so but
[35:56] Jesus also had the authority to
[35:57] recognize the voice of Satan because the
[36:00] Jesus discerned the stalled in the bread
[36:02] he had to consume it himself to the
[36:04] powered oedema
[36:05] god never told him the door and he said
[36:07] I don't do nothing except the father
[36:09] showed me he said it is written
[36:11] I'll do it he's a man should not live by
[36:14] bread alone haloumi got me we why did he
[36:17] did not take from what he said he told
[36:19] Adam you eat bread into the day you go
[36:21] back to the desert but would it come
[36:23] down to either that will let you know
[36:25] devil I got no I told Adam in the
[36:27] beginning I'll do that man ate bread I
[36:29] won't let you know man should not live
