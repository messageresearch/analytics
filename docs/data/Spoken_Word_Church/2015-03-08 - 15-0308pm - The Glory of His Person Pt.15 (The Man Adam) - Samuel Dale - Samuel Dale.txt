the lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in revelations 1 then we'll go to genesis 2 and then we'll try to conclude in first corinthians 15. revelations 1 genesis 2 1 corinthians 15. remember now the fellowship meeting will be on the third saturday and just come and let's have a good time brother bray will be preaching for us we'll be having a good time in the lord so remember these announcements get everything ready and be prepared to sisters getting the food ready and all of the doings right so we'll we'll do that okay revelations 1 genesis 2 and 1st corinthians 15. the heavenly father we thank you lord jesus that you lord would thank enough about us that you would come to earth and die for our place that we might lord become you as to what you would desire for us to be we ask you to just help us now and give us understanding ears as to the things that are spoken and why we look to you the author and finisher of those things each one lord remember the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so just have your way guide us now forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in jesus name amen revelations 1 12 and 13 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clove with a garment down to the foot and gird about the palps with a golden girdle now let's go to genesis 2 and 7. try to get all of these together if we can in the message and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils and he became into his nostrils of breath of life and he became a living soul now let's go over to the familiar scriptures with most of us when you're talking about chapter 15 but i want you to think about it and go into verse 45. not we're not trying to deal with all about the body part and all but to deal with this part of 45 through 47 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the life's ma diced adam was made a quickening spirit howbeit which means nevertheless you know that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and after that which is spiritual all right now that does not mean that the physical occur we know the spiritual come first but it means that when he's coming on over in the flesh all right now the first man is the is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word as i said don't mix that up where it sounds like it's going backwards and forth get the text of what things are doing we were trying last night to uh speak a little bit there in romans of where paul was talking about the things i would i do not the things i do i would not and i told you the background he brought was the first part so when you see the background part and then you get all what's going on then you can finally understand what's being said and what's going on now what was our thought this morning that we were trying to get to when we were talking about the soul man you know we were trying to get the point to word that we could look at it and get understanding how that this man that is created in genesis 1 26 and 27 is the spiritual man all right then genesis 2 7 was a physical man all right now in getting that together then we understand and we don't try to cross over which one is what we try to keep it in the right place and you forgive me for blowing my nose because i can't help that part because it i can't reach up in there and turn it off and then when you do reach up in there and turn it off when it's trying to run it's going to clog up and you've got a headache so which one's the best all right i may run out of handkerchiefs at a while but i've got a bunch laying up here all right but now remember what our thought was that the genesis 1 26 man even though you can use that as an example of saying that all mankind is a special creation you know everybody in the world and that they you know are in the image form of god in the fact that they are little creators you know and even though they're in the fallen estate they still have those things you know that they can make a better car make a better home do all kind of things but the point was that this man of 126 and 27 was a special built man this man was made and it was made male and female right now you remember that created he them male and female created he him all right it comes back to one point all right and see i believe now that this man is the point of what we've been talking about that god is coming down to you know for us to understand his descending and how that he came and you remember how we had the drawing up of showing the things that was on this side over here and then in the line that we talked about eternity and then uh what was on the other side would be over into this part here and and life and uh in doing it see then that was the way god condescended and he came down as to be the word the son of god all right and he then would create and he would create a man in his image in his likeness exactly like him now to me that's not a secondary man or another person you might think it is it's all right that's your choice but as i was trying to explain this morning remember all mankind is not made male and female a little baby born it's not made male and female you know that's not you know that's not the way it is because all mankind even though you could say all souls were created before the foundation of the world is right in the mind of god he knew ever soul would ever come into the world every being every person everything he knew that or he wasn't god all right but just knowing that would mankind would come doesn't put us into any uh special category it just lumps us in with everything and we did after when you come on down after the fall and you're coming through then you see that then all mankind is you know going to come forth and all mankind would have been in the mind of god and by his foreknowledge he would know who would accept jesus christ and who wouldn't we'll get to those things as we proceed a little further trying to hold the point like this morning that was speaking about the creation of one man which was the man adam all right and technically you know i know brother random uses it as that but you go in there technically his name was not given unto him as adam until he was made in flesh it doesn't give a name to this man of 126-27 right and we talk about that and we don't have any problem with saying that eve you know that eve never received her name until she failed then she was called the mother of all living because it would not have been uh complimentary to give her the name eve while she was in adam it just says woman right no name all right so now is it with adam that the 126 man doesn't have a nametag to it because the name would signify coming into earth and being you know upon the earth and being uh mankind or man all right so it wouldn't it wouldn't have any relation so you wouldn't be doing that so then i believe the 126 27 and 28 going on over into 28 you pick up a little more that that is the spiritual man because that's the way the prophet brought it out so he said well you know we'll read the quote in just a minute where he he put it over in all right but the 126 man then would be a spiritual creation in the image of god the genesis 2 7 man the flesh man is in the image of animals all right see then that would put it into the point but i hope you follow that point in your thinking that you know and it'll help you to understand to see that all mankind was not made in genesis 1 26-27 that would have been a special man and really i'm trying my best to get you to see that that's one man we have to start with adam but this man adam that we start with was made different than any other man that would ever come into the earth you know outside the lord jesus christ himself because this man would come as to be male and female all right because in the theophany or the soul the being that was created in 126 and 27 it would be in the basis that once adam was placed into i'll get to that the lord willing wednesday once he was placed in two flesh that flesh man was lonely because part of his being was still somewhere else the way the prophet describes it all right so that would make it uh the word it would give us understanding of what we're doing all right now this man that is created we look at him as seeing him in a very special form because of his creation and the ability of what he was and the things and this person if we look at it correctly i wrote this in my notes where i'd remember to make sure three times and i wrote it one more time or whatever to say but you'd say brother dale you're seemingly trying to make the 126 and 127 man god well what can you make it that's right it is certainly not a physical situation right and it's certainly not physical man it's uh you know i noticed this morning that i got to preach in a while didn't blow as much so help pray for me on that all right i know what i can do to stop it but that wouldn't work too good and the lord has always made me kind of funny to differ to everybody else my wife was telling the doctor about it the other day i'm a different person i know all the way but especially in that that if if you have a bad cold and you lay down at night you get sicker i have a bad cold and i'm sniffling and i'm coughing i go lay down we'll put my head down i stop ask boyd about your breathing machine you can't stay on it when your nose is stopped up mine just running like everything i was on it last night because as destroyed maybe god made me where i could sleep i thank him for that all right but now think this man if this man is in the image of god then it's not and i keep emphasizing that where you'll remember it it's not like something in the image of something it's like the creation all right and then the rest of the creation okay see it's the same person in another form all right trinitarianism she won't work but it's the same god in another form father son and holy ghost is not three gods is god revealed in three manifestations uh three offices three whatever you want to put to it to to help your understanding but it's the same god amen well i i believe now that this genesis 2 uh genesis 1 26 man is the very one that created moved over in another form and it would be called the offspring of god that way you remember how i was bringing it out and just a little thought we'll pick some of that up later that all souls being created before the foundation of the world and a lot of that is just in the mind of god but it's not so with the real true offspring of god because that's the eternal life i hope you'll get one point i wrote it in my notes at the end i hope you get one point out of what i'm trying to bring all right and that one point is that if we can get this in the correct order of understanding who we are by the new birth brings our soul back to the position that it should have been now you are following me by the new birth it brings our soul back to the position that should have been had there not been a fall you want me to get that one we're running brother branham i believe it's uh spoken word original seed where he said being born by the word and spirit brings you back like it should have been in the original he said i just caught that if you remember the quote there's something similar to that all right and see think about it now this man is a special man and if it is not god creating something separate from himself then this man here would be what was supposed to have been for all the offspring of god the children of god you see then that way it would be god coming into manifestation you say yeah but that's making us god i wish i could get it to you you know enough to where you would realize who you are and then we can have faith in what we are all right because i'm not putting any any uh glory or anything upon anything else other than god himself because that's where i have to put it all right so this man now of 126 and 27 was the part of god that came out of god right part of his being part of his person and part of his very soul our being that's what i believe about the 126-27 man then it would be no problem to understand how when we get to it in a little bit in blasphemous names when that that you can take one the 20-26 man put it into the 2-7 man and brother branham says he breathed into his nostrils and he became an eternal person with god see that's where we're going in the message so you you listen to it all right the very part remember we covered how that brother brown said a part of god went out he said it's not like an arm falling off it's not like a doing this it simply means god moved into another form right all right see then this is just the expanding of god adam is going to come into being now listen and you think about it adam is going to come into being in the way we're trying to bring it because that's what he did has to be an eternal person that's the way the prophet brought it so now what are we doing because adam is going to be the example son see then the first man adam as we read in corinthians was made a living soul the second man adam which is who jesus christ has made a quickening spirit the god of glory all right it's just defining it and showing it as it would come into being as to what god is actually doing and he shows exactly what he wants in adam right was he not god of the earth god is the god of glory of heaven but he's god demands to be god of the earth all right that's our domain that's why that even the animals the most ferocious of the animals is afraid of the mankind because that was the way it was created he was created to be his ruler his master and his doings all right now so what is the soul of man it's the being the person who he is and this then would not be god uh creating a person he created the body yeah it had a beginning right right and you know if it's got a beginning it's going to have an ending that's right then adam's body where he where he messed up he fell the prophet gave it in the seal book and we'll get to that later he said he fell from eternal life right to death now before we get there and even talk about that are you going to think that god gave adam eternal life and then took it away from him and sent him to hell because if he didn't have eternal life he goes to hell right well you better define what you're talking about adam fell from the ability to come forth into eternal life he never fell from eternal life like having it falling away from it because you can't do that god is not an indian giver do we believe that what so think about this special person and i titled the message i'd always try to title it to get your attention if you're looking on the things or to anybody else and i titled it the man you know lock him into man adam because it's got to be the whole thing of coming into being to see what the original would be and how that original that would be would be what god would want from all of his children that's right you said but brother dale adam fell may i quote the prophet before we get there but when adam fell he had a sacrifice right right so now what are you going to deal with all right now watch the point as we're trying to get into it this then was not of genesis 1 26 and 27 i say that to make sure that you you hang on to the one i'm talking about then it's not a creation like god created a man if he gives this man eternal life what was he intending to do to start with is not the point that you and i are supposed to come to eternal life by the new birth then if we are then what's the difference in how we came other than sure the sinful condition right that's that's in there but remember without that sinful condition entering the picture our god our creator would have never been able to display any of his attributes right so he knew what we would do but this first man adam was not made in a sinful condition even his body was made perfect now i didn't say eternal his body was made perfect because that was what it would turn out to be all right but the soul that would be put into that body is going to have to be eternal life or have eternal life any way you want to say it that's your point now remember then that this is not the creation of mankind because you would run into the trouble about having the male and female for every individual that would be created but this is the creation of adam in the basis of the what the part that he would be of this being that we're going to talk about you say this being yes this first son now we brought it down through right the first son of god was what not that god created jesus and jesus created everything else right you remember the first son was god's own creation coming into being that we could understand see then the first son would be the logos the theophany or god made manifest in another form called the word that could create all right then the soul of adam was the second son come on now you're supposed to remember all these things i don't have to repreach so much you remember about the last week or something we've quoted where brother brown said he gave birth to his son the word the logos the creator that was not god giving birth to another person that was god moving over into another into the same form i mean into that form and would be called a son all right or the son of god all right so now this second son what about him what about this second son that comes into being the 126 man come on here with me so if the first son was not a second person you agree it was the person in another form called the sun the word all right now if that be true then this second son would have to be that same god in another form called the son of god is that what the bible says about adam adam there was the son of god is that in the lineage over and probably in the matthews or somewhere when it brings into the lineages and you're going backward and you go back to adam which it says which was the son of god all right see then the very image of god or very person of god would then be stepping over into this man of 126 and 27 or that would be him that would be that and he would be then watch well let's just read it go ahead brothers pull up number one and let's read it see that's where i love to go to the prophet and ask him questions you know i mean here on i'm saying i need to know something on god's power transformation look what he says now this great creator had placed his created son now go back and find out what he's talking about and just go into a garden and a thing now adam was his first created son but but brother dale brother branham said that god was his first creation no now adam was his first created son watch jesus was his only begotten son see he was begotten by a woman but adam was right straight from the hand of god in creation now i'd be real careful there how i tried to handle that very much because remember jesus was begotten he was not created but yet he's called what in revelations 3 14. the beginning of the creation of god right right so he was begotten from a wound of a woman jesus was this man that he's talking about here is his created son the adam was his first created son but jesus was a begotten son adam was straight from the hand of god in creation then he covered how the bride is to be in the things but we don't want to try to get into those things we want to move on a little bit further going down to the next one which is but it wasn't so from the beginning 1961 how many knows that god is like and when god became flesh and dwelt in the body that he created which was his only begotten son adam was his son a creative son but jesus was his begotten son he's trying to defy the difference in how that that came adam never came by wound right right adam came by creation all right so then who is this one that we're talking about who is he roll that up let me see if i can find the bottom part uh yeah now he's describing the coming down that jesus the son of god had the spirit without measure is that right but we have it by measure but it's the same spirit right right it's the same spirit what makes him the fullness by a new birth makes us part of that so that's where you're going to start off with adam right you say yeah but that's getting too close brother dale that's that's trying to make us a god well what's the problem right what's the problem with it let's just read a few things the prophet has said about this to see that he's even bringing it down to where we are now so what it would it be to start off in adam is we'll get back to him in a minute look at the next one number three which is progress 77 of adoption he's the logos that went out of god that is true that was the son of god then he made man that little god okay and he said if they called those who the word of god came to the prophets they called them gods who the word of god came to and god said so himself that they were gods he told moses and the thing all right he made a man a god made man a god a god in his domain and his domain goes from sea to sea from shore to shore he has diver he has the control of it is it too bad to think about he goes on down in that same one to say verily i say unto you that's little gods you'll say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you've said amen all right even in the point of coming through the fallen condition do you know that that is the place that you and i are supposed you and i in this day because no other age could achieve it we're supposed to come to that place or are you like some that say and i could quote names but because i heard them say it but no need of it man said that the third pull is the for only brother branham and the lord jesus well everybody just glory glory glory then we don't have to worry about nothing right but i can't help but being able to remember where brother branham said the third pull was for the bride and the church and to the totally lost all right if you need that quote let me know i thought that the prophet coming was to bring the word for the bride to be made manifest i didn't know it was just for the prophet to be made manifest but it was to be for the whole thing right right you say what brother dale i just don't see well why don't you look around the whole world you see it's impossible for the ministry of brother branham to be back i differ with you but it's around the world it's not in one person no more it's not in one person anymore it's gonna have to be in the bride of christ around the world that's no excuse because we've seen what god has done here we've seen the sick healed we've seen the dead rays we've seen the storms spoken out of existence we've seen rain come at the words of someone speaking it we've seen many things that people don't want to credit that they want to put out just in some pentecostalism well that's all right i don't worry about it if you put it in pentecostalism because if you're going to put it in pentecostalism you're admitting that it happened that's right so now you're trapped with your own thinking right sorry just don't let that spirit get too offending at me okay don't let me become your enemy because i tell you the truth look what he goes on to say on the unfailing realities of the living god god always likes to work through men it's god's program to work through men do you believe that congregation says amen god works through men he made man his helper on earth he made man a lesser god than himself what would be a lesser god do we believe in the uh because that's what the word demon god comes to and if i've mispronounced that you put it in the right place and spell it a demon god is a lesser god and that's what they're saying today that jesus wasn't god the people of this message a lot of them because they're saying he become god on the river jordan then it left him in the garden and you know and then he died a man and this and the other that's a demon god that's a lesser god then when you come to the prophet he says no man can die like that man said it took god to hang on that tree and to do the things that he went through but yet that's people and their ideas see but he's a lesser god roll down up just a little bit further to the next part of that quote and when god made man in his own image he put him on the earth as a lesser god jesus declared it when he said is not it written in your laws that ye are god's and if they call those gods who the word of god come to which was the prophets how can you condemn me when i say i'm the son of god he said see they just couldn't understand but man was put here with a dominion over the earth he had everything under his control what about a lesser god what about these things we'll get this out of the way and then we'll drop back to our point of what we're talking about look at the next one which is god's provided way of approach number five the prophets were considered gods man was give give made a lesser god and given a dominion over the earth that's the reason that the world today is groaning waiting for the full manifestation of the sons of god right now if that's what the world is waiting for was not that what it started with are you with me was not adam the god of the earth till even he named the animals the things what about it oh there's a great deep and blessed teaching in that that someday man will still come back into his right place and his domain will be the earth and he will speak to the tree or to the mountain or to anything and it'll just go in place just like it was in intended to be we are fallen creation creatures creatures all right what about it then what about this man that was made there in the garden what about him do you see adam as he was god now let's don't come over the fall and get all we got to get it all you got to run ahead see that's that's just a human brain you got to you got to run ahead and show how smart we are when when a person tells you just stay with me you know i mean if i go so far and cut off then the rest of it you're going to be presuming of what i'm going to speak right right because i'm the one's got the notes so i just stay with the person that's trying to get you to understand well you don't want me to think i said something one time the brother said you telling me i can't write down what you said i said no i'm telling you you can't right fast enough because you can't ride as fast as i talk even the secretary typing has trouble right if you had the typewriter you might be able to follow me but try it sometimes follow writing it down because you see that's where people come to me and see that's why we keep the tapes i've had people to come to me and they said brother dale you said so and so i said no i didn't yes you did i heard you never said it yes we did okay we solved that problem we'll go get the tape and play it see whether i said it or not well i guess because they i guess they realized about that time that if i was willing to pull the tape i pretty well knew i didn't say it because it was something outlandish you're sitting there writing down and you hear me and you're trying to write down and i'm not saying for you not to write write little short notes and do things to keep up to get you back later but when you're sitting there writing and trying to write and i'm over here and i say and and i committed adultery and while you're saying he said he committed adultery well you didn't hear all before thee and what was the reason i was bringing that point that if i had went out and done something wrong with a woman i committed adultery all you hear he committed adultery that's what he said well maybe you should write short notes i write notes you ought to see my my notes i write notes and if you'll notice a lot of times preachers up here can see it you'll see me write it and aaron's shaking his head and i tear that off and stick in my pocket and i'll write something out there that i'll just a little short note all right cause you can't well forget it listen let's look at this man and get the thought and then we'll try to pick it up look at the next one the messiah which is 1961 paragraph 37. now we say in the man the man before i leave that subject the man what is he he's got a hand like god got eyes like god got ears like god got a body like god now you say well well god's not real okay he was fastened after god he was given an earth and a dominion he was made god over the earth to rule the earth a lesser god god rules the universe everything but man was given the earth to rule the earth he was he was a messiah that's what he is tonight if he gets back to god he is a messiah and a little messiah if he had if messiah means anointed one and we're anointed then what are you that's exactly right messiah we call it that just for the word's sake till we get to a little further down into the scripture all right so what's he talking about now why was this man created in genesis the 126. what was he made in genesis let's just read it and we'll let him do it go to the next one number seven which is off of the messiah the same message but it's paragraph 16. now isaiah 9 6 we just won't read it but he was to be the everlasting father to mighty god when god made man in genesis 1 26 it shows if you're putting that scripture down genesis 1 27. it shows that god made man to be a god to begin with he was made to be a god a lesser god he was made in the image and likeness of god he had hands like god he had feet like god eyes ears and intelligence like god his whole fiber because he was a son of god and jesus referred to him as god all right are you with me he goes on in the sardisian church age and said who is the god of the earth he said man that's his domain the earth belongs to man it was given to him and he was ruler over everything all nature's groaning waiting for that time when the sons of god will be manifested again oh my oh my manifestation of the sons of god and if you were only the prophets you'd be running into trouble but that's all right you keep your thoughts look at the breach paragraph 99 when adam sinned he heeded his wife's reasoning instead of holding to to god's word that's what made adam sin his wife reasoned with satan and produced the product to adam and adam turned loose the word and sold out he lost all his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life and we'll get back to these in the next message the day you eat there that day you die and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth god's the god of the universe everywhere but his son had this earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature it could do anything he wanted to see but when he did that he lost his inheritance now adam could say let this mountain here be moved over the earth and it would do it adam could say let this tree here be plucked up and be planted over here it would do it for he had complete supreme control as a minor god under god our father because he was a son of god all right now is that enough to think about the point so we can get back to adam that this man adam was a special creation this man adam was made in the image of god he was made in theophany he was made a soul a person a being and that was what god would want all of his offspring to be it's to be like adam all right and adam would be the ruler of the earth because he's a son of god so it's not a second person it's just not god creating a man and calling him adam and then saying well i'm just going to let him run this if you're listening to what i've tried to bring this morning and i'm trying to bring now then you're seeing the point that this man that we're talking about and 27 would have to be the offspring of god which would have to be god in another form called a son right which would not be a second person amen he would be the person and that's the way he started his church amen was to be that away oh yeah we'll get on the end of the fall how did it come out and how they were done but just i wish you would remember one thing too you said but brother dale you're talking about adam with eternal life how could he fall you have eternal life by the new birth why do you do wrong i don't do wrong bless god i am a son of god and i never had a wrong thought you might not but you had a lie come out of your mouth because even jesus satan tried his best to enter the mind of the lord jesus don't think that just because you're a christian that you can't do wrong that's right now you can't sin enough to be lost no but you can sin enough to get have to answer for it right there's going to be a correction somewhere all right but are you following me now get away from the notes to where i can talk about this man this man his name wasn't adam because he was given that when he was put in flesh this man would be what would make the man adam eternal once he's put into adam this would be a part of god an offspring of god that's why people can't understand it then do you believe any you believe in pre-existence or soul i believe in pre-existence of one soul that's the soul of almighty god then i believe and i've always tried to teach you that soul that i'm talking about is constantly expanding amen as he gives you a part of himself don't worry about it you're not going to run out of parts god i'm talking about with the 7 billion people that's in the world today i can't even calculate that much we used to talk about a million dollars and how big a room it would take to put all one dollar bills in it that was in school now million dollars they need nothing i can't even what is a billion it's a billion ten hundred thousand million thousand million okay we we get these scientific educated people a thousand million i can't even comprehend that but there's seven billion people in the world you know that god could give every person the baptism of the holy ghost and he would be no less god when he got through right he would have more abilities right right you remember what is it there in the scriptures that that we can't do anything greater but by having more members it can be called more because there's more members right all right simply the plan of salvation simply speaking of how that god would start the man in the place and of course we want to get a we want to get a big story in our mind you know we like that don't we we like to read love story magazines and fantasize yeah i ain't talking about me i'm talking about people fantasize in your mind we try to figure it all out when the best thing to do is why not just accept it you can't figure out eternal life why don't you just accept it and let god take care of the rest of it you know why not just let him take care of all of it and reveal it you know what in all the studying you've ever done has never revealed anything to you or either the prophet missed it when he said the holy ghost is the only revealer of the word now if you don't read the word he can't reveal it to you because he can't open your head and pour it in faith comes by hearing and what hearing by the word and the word came by the prophet so that's why we ought to hear what the prophet has to say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and depend upon what he said about it and what amazes me so much is the things maybe you don't never think about but you watch these notes that i bring you sometimes that i'll have five six pages of quotes and things from brother branham from 47 to 65. and he's still saying the same thing well i can show you where he was wrong come on it's on internet don't be silly now don't come up with 700 instead of 7 000. don't come up with a white horse rider the way he taught it before because you didn't know nothing about the white horse rider and i didn't either until he came to tell us right and god and the man wasn't responsible until god opened the seals then he could teach the white horse riders the holy ghost and there was nobody to be able to correct him remember a prophet correction comes from god right okay so this man adam now or this man that we talk about would be one man but that man would have multiple forms i'll tell you what i believe i believe that man of genesis 1 26 and 27 was the christ and that one day he would come on the earth as a human mortal and he would give his life and that would start what he wanted in the garden for 4 000 years of man's time he never got what he wanted for 4 000 years of the old testament people he never got what he wanted the best he could do was get a few good people and most of them had plenty of flaws right what we're talking about last night when we talk about law and things then we only make the law always be in the ten commandments that's not what paul's talking about in romans when he talks about the law this and the commandments came because he said when the commandments came sin revived and i died what's paul talking about when the commandments came sin revived and i died have you ever got into that maybe some of you ought to go back and listen to what was said maybe or to play last night's message to the entire church because i enjoyed it all right because we saw what paul was talking about right then when the commandments came sin revived and i died the law didn't kill paul paul thought he was keeping the lord he was to the letter the law didn't kill him right but when christ came on that road to damascus when he was struck down right there paul became a sinner the man that had never done what he had never broke the laws right because that's what he said concerning the law blameless you argue with him the high priest couldn't have one mark against him or he'd be killed right paul wasn't a high priest but he was studying to be a um brother ryan said something about he's either studying to be a lawyer or being could be a high priest you know we see paul was looking at it when when that struck him down and brought around said that that pro man would not have called that any other thing then the great elohim almighty god they've struck him down and see his surprise was is when he said who are you and he said i'm jesus whom thou persecuted there's no record paul ever persecuted jesus he was there he knew about him probably done arguments about him and thing but he never done any damage until he come over with stephen and started with the doings of the killing of the church paul knew right then that all the law he had kept was just a school master right and could not bring life the law never brought life to no one you could keep it to the letter you can keep this message to the letter and still die and go to hell make a good person make a good neighbor right all right get off but do you understand that what i'm trying to drive at this man that come into being there in genesis 1 26 and 27 would be all mankind that would ever receive eternal life because adam came right amen right amen but everybody after the end didn't come right right we're giving them things then when jesus came he was the commandment he was the law he was the whole thing and he was that man that was doing why did brother branham make this statement about he said the only way he could be father was to be the son of man you remember that i'm glad to get you the quote i think it's the unveiling of god i'll find it for you the only way he could be the father he wanted to be would take place on the day of pentecost because nobody in that old testament except adam had eternal life he had to give it to adam to make it start right right all right so we'd realize who we are are you listening i want you to understand what i'm saying and then you make your mind up this man of 126 and 27 would be more than just to say the one man adam because remember eve was a part of it we got the quotes for it where she was still in theophany all right so it's not just a one man a one tall it's a one man in an example adam was the example son of the old testament jesus was the example son of the new testament right but you see this man here he is the soul of god there's only one soul that comes eternal you want to argue that point there's one soul that comes eternal that's the soul of god see then adam got a special impartation he got eternal life all right we're going to have to define something right now to word that you'll understand so listen so when adam was made his spiritual being was 126-27 that would be put into 2 7. but a lot of people's thoughts would be about adam let's see if i can define it that adam was body and spirit adam and then he was given eternal life why does it stipulate that he breathed into the nostrils of adam and he became a living soul all right if you take the body and the spirit and call it adam and just put the eternal life in there to be separate from anything else because you see you're going to get tricky here for a few minutes so you better listen all right then you don't have adam you have god that's what i thought you've been trying to say no you got to bring the man adam into being right you got to bring the man adam into being and then you got to remember that eve is still part of that atom and she ain't brought into being there she's brought into being later what does it take to be a human being we had it this morning we didn't go through it but brother brown says you're a circle of a human being said you're a triune being just like god as father son and holy ghost and what did he say he said it's body spirit and soul that's what it takes to make a human being right body spirit soul makes a human being he said without either one of them i had a miss mourning to going to you but but you ought to know it but he said without either one of them you're not complete so you're not complete without body spirit and soul all right you can't just have a body in the spirit and be a human being i'd make you no different in the animal we're going to read that in a minute that's right all right because you just have a body and spirit of creation you'd be that but it takes body spirit and soul you see why the prophet would spend so much time explaining that and explaining what happens to each realm and what's going on and see then in his early ministry he would be explaining body soul spirit and beholding that as a way of describing it placing the spirit as the center rim and then from somewhere around close to the greatest battle ever fought in 62 from there on he starts describing it as body spirit and soul well i'd like to know where he corrected that i'd like for you to show me where he corrected it if he didn't correct it then i don't think you and i have the ability to correct it right but if he was right all the time he didn't need to correct it he just his wordings was a little different because i've challenged you to find it and see he always gave outer rim see taste filled smell in here body he always gave the second rim of mankind whether he called it soul or whether he called it spirit he always gave the second realm of man memory reason conscious affection etc he always gave the center realm of man whether he called it bod a soul or called it spirit he gave it one sense faith or doubt so did he need to correct it i think that maybe that was withholding from him to were that mankind could use those things to try to trap the people with it because that's where the two soul people got their goings from but remember the bible says i give you a new heart and a new spirit right remember the bible speaks of the soul as being the real you that will go on after death and be either given eternal life or annihilated one day but god himself so did the prophet have to explain it no if you ain't got enough sense to realize that you make three circles and you give three circles and you give each one of them a nature or point or being and it don't matter what you call them it's still the same three circles i put that out in a minister's meeting years ago and they just went haywire yeah but he said but he said okay you explain it you're going to make him contradictory one to the other and i'm not making him contradictory i'm making him to where he's saying the same thing outer rim five senses see takes field smelling here second rim memory reason conscious affections loving you don't even love with your body you don't love with your soul you love with your spirit that's why you can be anointed on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell right but what if you took the old testament i mean the old form of what he would be using and putting the spirit as the center rim and then he would say you can have the anointing on your spirit you'd be in trouble you can't do that just like to lay out a few things a tron being to what was adam was he simply just a lifeless body standing there it's all right whatever you want to do you know when god created the body of genesis 2 7 was it just a lifeless form and then all at once he gave him eternal life and breathed into his nostrils and he become a living soul and automatic right then he gave him a soul that wouldn't be adam that'd be the same thing jesus was all right so what about this man brother brown said he put the genesis 1 26 and 27 into this 2 7 man he said it's not two people it's the same man he said he just put him into that but you say well well all right okay let's read then go ahead brothers and start uh on number 11. that number 10 is the one where he explains about the the uh what the body spirit and soul and what we are so look what he's saying here on blasphemous names we start in the paragraph 184 and we'll read about just leave it up leave it down to that 184 we're going to start our whole thing now here's jehovah witness in their book it says that the breath that you breathe is the soul now that cannot be right the breath that you breathe is not soul if it is you're you're one time you're one kind of a soul next time time you're somebody else has breathed that soul you know the the breath the going out that they talk about look where you'd be now the breath is the wind and the wind is what you breathe into your nostrils now they take the scripture from and god breathed breath into his nostrils and he became a living soul now i want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of a breath was he breathing before god breathed his breath of life into him two points that you can consider in this what kind of a breath was he a breathing living man well to take one side of it to say if that be so then every animal is a living soul if it's just a breath there'll be something a little different going on because they breathe a human soul and our soul and all together then jesus wouldn't have had to die the animal sacrifice would have been sufficiency oh brother the argument don't stand but what god did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he become a living soul a soul that can't die now watch now we're going to get into honey plum to our elbows notice breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul because god breathed now once not what nature done but what god did he breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul then you say to me adam died brother branham but remember before adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him hallelujah those who he foreknew he has called he got a lamb to redeem them he was a type adam failed then the lamb was provided for adam because already in his nostrils had come become the breath of the eternal god and he became a living soul he was the son of god now this breath is a african word you know the greek words and the different things these sinners breathe the more you bring it on up then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the eternal soul buried into us by breath why would we struggle for eternal life it backfires brother it just can't do it but god especially upon adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with god he had power like god he was an amateur god he was god of the earth not god of heaven no god of the earth and someday the sons of god will again become gods all right so now into adam he breathed eternal life now when we are born as children god has to breathe into our nostrils life for us to live but he doesn't breathe eternal life and if he breed it into you and wouldn't breathe it into me then he's a respecter of persons and we lost that thought so then there was no one past adam to christ that could talk about eternal life now you've got to bring eve in there and we'll bring her into the next message all right and i believe she had eternal life all right there's no quote that says she had it because i've run the message you know but we'll get to the point of trying to understand if she was a part of adam and theophany then that's the part but get get one thing something special had to happen to this man that when he was turned around and called adam because god gave him eternal life now that's your prophet you argue with him i can just see them old things are clicking you can't have eternal life to calvary you've got to be borned again yeah that's all right go ahead but you're not in back in what the prophet had to say about it and none whatsoever and i'm glad he said it because we didn't know it right right we didn't know adam had eternal life right we just know he became a living soul you see the prophet could read between the lines and see that adam started out with eternal life but i want to ask you a simple question is a thought was adam body and spirit and then no soul whatsoever that wouldn't be adam that would be christ but if adam body and spirit was made a man standing there and he was a soul a being a person and then god put eternal life into adam then it would be adam now we'll cover this point this is a thought see then eve was still in theophany then when eve was made was she just made a body and a spirit she had to have a soul whatever you want to think she had to have a soul she had to get it some way some way adam got a soul or was a soul and then god could breathe into his nostrils eternal life same thing with eve because eve was still in theophany and had to be taken from that and put into flesh before that come into being and remember she never got her name eve no more than adam got a name as genesis 1 26 he got a name when it comes into being about 2 7 of the natural man eve never got her name until the fall because it would be wrong in the scripture because eve it says what does it say the definition of her name is the mother of all living so she brought forth the seed of the serpent and the seed of adam she's the mother of all living that's why i say there ain't no such thing in outer space you don't believe in extraoretrial beings no unbelieving and we're here if there's anybody out there in any way or any form he had to come from here well how do you know that because it said eve was the mother of all living okay soft no argument right i love it that way well that just makes you a smart aleck well no no it might make me a nellie but i ain't too smart because if i smart i'd quit preaching sit down and listen to somebody else i guess but think about it this man adam because that's the only way you can talk brother brandon could you know he couldn't come up and say now no name was the man that was in 126-27 and then he was given a name adam and and so we'll deal with no name over here and adam over here he didn't do that he just talked about adam i can talk about adam but i know what happened to adam adam means the beginning our red man you know earthly he had to come into being as an earthly part to be called adam which was a genesis 2 and 7 man he said do we need to understand this what is the new birth why do you need the new birth what do you need a new birth for if the breath of life in a baby's nostrils makes it eternal why did jesus christ have to die so we know that's not true and we know we didn't come the way god wanted us to come right we know that for sure that we didn't come the way god intended for it to be but he's going to use it his permissive will and make it his perfect and to do that it was necessary that he have to come and die now may i ask you a question as we read the quote this morning that brother brown said when he walked here on the shores of galilee paraphrasing it we walked in him right you you need those quotes is that everybody understand the prophets made that statement many times that when he was on the shores of galilee i was in when he went to hell i went with him when he went to the grave i went with him do i need to go pull those quotes because they can pull them in a hurry back there but listen how was i in christ it would have to be a part of his own life right not physically speaking i mean we didn't come here to have enough sense to not think about that we come here physically in him or any form like that but the eternal life i have today was in him when he walked the shores of galilee is that you so then that eternal life was the one that was put into adam that's right so that man was christ amen and that man one day came into human flesh and we called him jesus christ and that eternal life that we have today was in him when he was walking back there did brother around and say we was even in his side does that mean we were physically in there you know and he had to put a spear in there and let the blood run out and when it did we all flopped out don't be stupid right we were in him as part of his life this man adam had a part of his life and he was made eternal but nobody else from there on down until christ could say that it could speak in prophecies as thy soul liveth brother branham will even say see there are elijah they were talking about that even his soul liveth that it was eternal he's not giving him eternal life back there no because from that on it had to wait to calvary and that would be christ brother uh henry greene used to quote brother branham he said brother branham said one day that god started his church the way he wanted it he said and he said he wants his church the way he started it now that's a good statement he started the church the way he wanted it he wants the church the way he started it he started in adam as an example son of the god of earth and we lost all of that rulership but even in our fallen estate we still have the abilities and the cree the parts to to put together to do things and and even the animals that said well ago are still scared of us right in their abilities we've been able to time every animal that's ever been in the world right he said well what about a big old grizzly you take a grizzly bear it's a little bitty cub and you raise it right and it's it ain't no big old big grizzlies you take the one up in alaska the big old white one that when you land there you're on the chain of command of food he's looking for something to eat and you're on that line if you get in the way but you take him as a baby and train him and he's a little bitty pet my nephew the other day was looking at some cows over terrence come on brother we're at terrance the other day and then little cows were standing up there and that old barbed wire fence was high pulled a fart you know and everything he's just tuckered down all that he said if them cows had any sense they could walk through that wire that's right that's life that's true if they could figure it out they'd just stick their head in there and keep going well you know what some of them does that and then you might as well put your yoke around his neck or shoot it because it ain't gonna stay in the pasture no more because he's gonna learn about being able to get out right because we're nothing and we're just a bigger animal but we are the one that god gave his life for he never gave it for huma for just animals he gave it for you man mankind let's stand together what do we got anybody have a need let's stand together i hope you go home and think about it what is that man talking about i'm talking about that there was a man in the garden created and that man was breathing his nostrils and he became an eternal person with god and that that's what god wants now out of you and i he became a manifested son of god that could name the animals that could lead them could rule them without harmful rulings he could rule them with love and the prophet said that's what god wants out of his children the manifestation of sons and daughters come back to realize who they are and what they're doing and what we're here for now ain't no need to worry about it it's not that away we'd walk out and i remember a man telling it years ago and how many of us has done it but he went up to this hornet's nest and he said i command you and they commanded him all right it wasn't long until he was leaving out of there and one man said he had these yellow jackets come up on the tree and said he said i command you little yellowjacket to get out of here and he said he got it right on the end of the nose all right that don't work that away that ain't even safe common sense to start screaming and hollering because the animal knows better but if you'll love the animal you might find out love can conquer well brother tatum was down at brother hollins one day he had a german shepherd that that suckered bit of tire on my car and had to pull it off because his teeth were so tough and that old dog was up in the back of the truck brother tatum hadn't been down there to see the dog or nothing we was going down to see brother holland and him and i told peggy and them brother tatum didn't hear me i said that dog's is rough i said because we parked there and rode to work i said y'all get behind me if the dog jumps i'll try my best to take care of the dog because we had to walk pretty close to the back end of the truck and old brother tatum come up before i could say anything old brother tatum brought past right by me and he walked up there and he that old dog was just you know he walked up there and he stuck his hand he said now blackie what's wrong with you that old dog just laid down in the back of the truck i mean just he had love in his heart for that animal that animal knew it go ahead brother number eight in the spiral book as i journey through the land singing as i go to calgary our brother's going for a chance tomorrow you know shocked my heart and bring it back in rhythm could she pulled it off you know that band that they put around your arm i put it right in behind that and i taped it daddy's got one under his watch right now when you we send this in the name of jesus christ oh lord don't you oh we love you father and we thank you and we thank you for your atonement that was made in the name of jesus christ let me say what he said and believe in your word and your love in jesus name anybody else i just have a name then my lord directs my at least we should be to the base at least we ought to be to the bases to believe god you was with me and you've seen me you've been here with me when they came out and told me that i had leukemia i looked that doctor in the eye and i said doctor i won't take none of your chemo so don't talk to me about it if you got anything else we'll talk about it but i'm on one side the table and you're on the other now i would never tell you whatsoever no one to not take chemo i wouldn't do that whatsoever we prayed this morning for the the one to be you know that the cumulative would be all right i believe in that i believe in doing what the doctor said well my point was you say well brother dale did it scare you when they told you that when they told me my heart was out of rhythm and they said what it'll do is that if it stays out of rhythm and things said blood will form in the body because it does not pump in the top part strong enough to remove all of the blood and said it'll remain in there and said it formed in the clots and said it'll go to your brain brother dale was you scared when he said that no i walked in the other day i was as calm as a cucumber i wish they had to put something on me when it was getting ready to do the shock treatment he said well i wouldn't let him do that well i said i'll give you one shot that's what you're getting if it don't work on this one we ain't going no more because i ain't fooling with it i walk in there and everybody knows you're all right i am great let's get on with this stuff they know they stayed in there with me until five minutes before they done the treatment the family was there and we were all lifeing and talking i want a little i'm scared i'm not afraid of dying i'm not afraid of dying that left me a long time ago i want to live for you to be able to help you in my family as far as living paul said it's greater for me to go home but said for you then i must remain why be afraid they tell you you've got cancer you know there's probably more people dies from toothache they just don't tell you about it the more people dies of common cold than to do cancer it's just that name why be afraid i know who made this man and i know who will take care of this man amen why worry about it well i just committed into the hands of the lord and say well okay lord you know what i've told all of you what go home and look in our medicine cabinet there's a prayer claw sticking in the medicine cabinet why we sanctify the medicine oh brother tom down there one time he told that old doctor he said and he was getting ready to operate which he didn't have to on that but he said i'm going along with your program but said you ain't going to find anything you get in there but said i want to lay my hands on you no doctor said okay you know i want to pray for you doc said okay prayer he said no no no i want to put my hands on your hands no doctor come over there you know and he just put his hands out and let him pray i was there with him in one time i don't know the many different stories because there's a lot of time to happen but the old doctor come out one day you know brother tom had went in there and it was supposed to been been drastic without his kidneys and something and that old doctor come back in there in a little while and this is where he just bounced through there he said y'all guys done it that's what he said because he knew dean you know new tom and he come and just run it y'all guys done it and dean said what he said they ain't a thing in that man and this was the doctor that had went in there and found the problem he said there ain't a thing in the man said i flushed him out said he'll be here in a minute to go home we've seen god heal we've seen god deliver when you see a man and his eyes rolls totally back in his head and he stops breathing and you call his name after he's been laying there a while and you call his name and he raises up and he says sam when you see those things take place it takes away a lot of fear oh no we're not stupid i ain't going to get in front of railroad track all right but i don't have no fear about that i fear about you you know when something's wrong with you i'm i'm afraid but to me death is not my victor i'm it's conqueror and i've proved it to you over the years and years that i've stood here with you and you've seen god come on the scene and deliver i say but brother dale if we just we just had this out of the other why not accept what we got you know what that's what i asked that doctor when he was talking to me about how do you feel with your heart out of rhythm i said how am i supposed to feel i'm 74 years old would you describe what i'm supposed to feel he said weak and nauseated and stumbling i said don't have none of that i still say any of you wanna work a whole day just come on we'll we'll see who lasts the longest why because i'm not afraid went down to deer hunting land the other day richard he wants to be the smartest and help pop out yeah he tried to climb up every tree but i beat him too some of them climbed them trees and took stand loose right because i ain't give up when i get give out then i'll think about giving up but until then i ain't gonna worry about it all right sorry about that just remember pray one for another just keep waiting in your mind as he's traveling and the lord is really seemingly must be blessing a lot if they had 600 brother danny's church i know i've been there unless he's got a new church they will stand in room only upstairs and downstairs if they had 600 in that building and this the lord will take care of everything and give us what we have need of right i believe that put what you got up on your own faith put it on your own faith say lord you know i believe i believe the prophet's message and you healed people before they never even heard of a prophet and i put it on his word and i believe it you know it might surprise you what's this like was listening the other night where brother brown said you prayed for he said you don't immediately get well when i didn't get it he said it might be three months later he was telling about the two ladies that brother branham had told one of them i know thus saith the lord about her one of them had a quarter and one of them had ulcers one of those two he told him it's not saith the lord might have told both of them now i'm just saying the best i can remember and you know it was months later and that lady was standing there and her husband even said honey said i agree with you but said you're making a little mockery out of of this about that you're healed said she's turned around to him and said husband said that man called me out and told me my life and the things that i'd done and all about me and said then he turned around and says you're healed and said i have no right to doubt what he said i'm healed her husband went to work said she looked said the kids had left some toast and she said i know i hate it but said i'll i'll eat it she ate a little piece of toast didn't bother her they left some oatmeal and he said that's one thing you don't eat with a bad stomach he said she ate the oatmeal said sit around there a little while and thought got up fried her some eggs and bacon and stuff and said just had a jubilee eaten well then she decided to go down and tell the neighbor that was the other lady in the story about what had happened since she got down nearly to that house and said she heard some screaming and hollering she thought the lady had died or somebody had broke in or something you know and said she goes in the house and said the lady's shaking the sheet in the bedroom said what are you doing she said i went to sleep last night with a border on my face or somewhere on her neck and said when i woke up this morning it's gone i'm trying to find it she turned around and told her her story of how this is delivered well see it may take three months but now let's don't prop it up by saying well you know it may take three months for this now let's believe and say thank you lord thank you lord but you never have thought i know what i would not say i guess names but i look at people like sister cleta she's just a little over 60. don't take no medicine does her own work cleans her own house works in the yard well you know i could rejoice over that let alone anything else brother how he's just a tad over 60. but i will tell you some things that's happened with brother howell sometimes if you want to sit down where he had some problems one time and he came up here and he said i believe the prophet i was there in his ministry but he said i believe that same god is still alive in your ministry and he said i'm going to put my healing on that and he was delivered he stumbled up here the other day hal brought him up i mean a boy brought him up asked him later i said how's his legs doing he said doing a whole lot better well the same god is still living all right lord jesus we could talk about you all evening lord we could talk about the great things that we've seen in our little days upon the earth that you've been able to use a little church to be able to call for healings for people and call for weather conditions and things to be out to do different things the dead rays the sick healed we could talk about them and we should i guess more and more lord but we get tired in body we just ask you to go home with everybody give a safe journey lord to each one and let your love be made manifest in our hearts and their lives in jesus name amen you dismiss pray one for another woman just hold on a little longer help is on the way better time is coming help won't help tomorrow you give up today she just hold on a little longer
