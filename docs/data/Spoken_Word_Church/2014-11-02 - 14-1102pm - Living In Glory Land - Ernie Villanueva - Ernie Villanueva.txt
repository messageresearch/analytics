how do you want to see you high and live shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we St holy holy holy I am lifted up shining in the light of your glory for to power and love s holy holy holy amen holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see sing it unto him Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see I want to see you see you high and lifted right shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy holy amen I lifted it up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy amen holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen bless you I couldn't hear you praise the lord well praise God Amen you know when we when we come into yeah me too when you come into the house of God we should be able to take all of our cares all of our our problems and we can just deposit them at the back door and come in and and really when I come in you know I I expect the supernatural to take place when I and you know when I first got saved in a little Baptist Church and uh you know I was way in the back row of the balcony because I had never been in the Baptist Church before I'd come from the Catholic church and uh you know the whole the whole Baptist environment seemed a little bit strange to me there was no statues and no candles and you know no stained glass or anything so I'm way in the back row of the balcony and the preacher he preached God's Divine judgment for The Sinner and he was preaching out of second Corinthians and he said you know uh you know if God's for you who who can be against you and uh so you know as soon as he made that altar call everything inside of me wanted to go but you know nobody else was going and I wasn't going to be the only one down there so I was back the next week and he preached again and and that time you know he really he really struck pay dirt and and I didn't care when when he made the invitation I was like Jack in the Box I just popped out of that seat and went right down there and I'll never forget you know so naive I said uh I said is what you're saying here the truth that you know uh if any man is in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away and All Things become new and God will separate your sins as far as the East is from the West to the sea of forgetfulness and and God will never never remember them and if God's for you who can be against you cuz I had written down all those notes and I had them right there and I said this this is this is what you know what what you said now I want to know is all this is all this how it works he says he says yes son I said so well I want to sign up cuz in the Catholic Church you had to sign up for everything so so I said I want sign up he says son he said nothing to sign up for he said we're just going to pray and I W I walked out of that that Baptist Church First Baptist of Winter Park Florida and I felt like a ton of bricks had been lifted off my shoulders and uh and and and you know the cigarettes went and alcohol went and uh you know I I I was just living in glory land and every time the doors were open I was there and they had a men's prayer breakfast at 6:00 in the morning I was there they had a uh Outreach meeting at on Monday I was there Tuesday was the young people's meeting then Wednesday was the midweek service then they had a a soup supper and every time they open the doors I was there and I I just couldn't get enough of it and uh and so so then you know I I I was I was still sitting in the back but I started moving up moving up moving up moving up and finally I I heard a oldtime preacher on the on the Bible he said when I go to church I want to be at at at the spout where the glory comes out and from then on I was front row anywhere I go I'm on the front row I don't want to be disturbed by anybody turning around or or lifting their children or picking their nose or whatever I don't want I don't want to be disturbed by any of that stuff I want to be right there and I want to be I want to be focused like a laser beam on what's coming from that pulpit and so so I expect the supernatural every time I come to church and I and and I trust that tonight that God will do something something or say something that that will inspire you to live a little bit closer and and uh you know get that get that that that seal tightened up you know real real tight so you are absolutely positive that you are going to have a safe arrival at that Port of Eternity amen God bless you um I'd like to have you turn in in your Bibles to First thess lonians we're going to read out of the second chapter 11th verse before we read let's pray father once again Lord we want to enter into that sweet Supernatural presence we want to come to the throne of grace with praise and thanksgiving in our hearts thanking you for the life that you've given us to live thanking you for the friends the brothers and sisters that have encouraged us to Long the way Lord we want to we want to be like you we want our hands to do what your hands would do and your feet our feet to be what your feet would do in our lips in our tongues to say the things that you would say so Lord I pray that you would take control of the service we committed into your hands bless your people father let let that great faith rise up in their hearts let the word be illuminated to their souls and help me Lord to move myself out of the way father and just say only what you would have said we ask these blessings and in your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen 1 Thessalonians 2nd chapter 11th verse as you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father thus his children that ye would walk worthy of God who hath called you unto his kingdom and Glory now that word Kingdom it it it designates royalty so God has called us into a kingdom it's a Royal Kingdom and we are priests in in in that Kingdom into his kingdom and glory for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye receed the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectively worketh also in you that believe amen God bless you and you can have your seats I know that everybody who who believes the message they they love to read and listen to what brother brandom has to say but every once in a while I'll I'll pick up a book and it'll be a book by uh you know I I I like to to read what Martin Luther had to say I like to read what John Wesley had to say and the experiences he went through and how he was out there trying to get souls saved and he met the people and and he found out that he wasn't he wasn't even saved himself and uh you know he was honest enough to to say that you know and he and and uh I love to to read Spurgeon Charles Spurgeon and I want to read something to you that that that he gave on a New Year's Eve service in other words a watch Night Service and and he used the scripture the Harvest is passed the summer is ended and we are not saved now can you imagine how Jeremiah felt when he when he had to say that to the children of Israel the Harvest is passed the summer is ended and we are not saved and and he gave this little exhortation just about a two-minute exhortation and he says uh and and i' like to you know exhort like I believe that char Spurgeon would would be exhorting and he starts off he said not saved dear reader is this your mournful plight warned of the judgment to come bidden to escape for your life and yet at this moment you are not saved you know the way of Salvation you read it in the Bible you hear it from the pulpit it is explained to you by friends and yet you neglect it and therefore you are not saved right you you will be without excuse when the Lord shall judge the quick and the dead the Holy Spirit has given more of less a blessing upon the word which has been preached in your hearing and Times of refreshing have come from the divine presence and yet you are without Christ all these hopeful seasons have come and gone your summer and your Harvest have passed and yet you are still not saved years have followed one another into eternity and your last year will soon be here youth has gone manhood is going and yet you are not saved and and and he's saying it like like you sh and still after all these things you are still not saved let me ask you will you ever be saved is there any likelihood of it already the most propitious seasons have left you unsaved will other occasions alter your condition means have failed with you the best of means use perseveringly and with the utmost affection what more can be done for you Affliction and prosperity have a light fail to impress you tears and prayers and sermons have been wasted on your Barren heart are not the probabilities dead against your ever being saved it is not more than likely that you will abide as you are till death forever bars The Door of Hope do you recoil from this supposition yet it is a most reasonable one he who is not washed in so many years will in all probability go filthy to his end the convenient time never has come why should it ever come it is logical to fear that it never will arrive and that that Felix like you will find no convenient season till you are in hell oh bethink you of what that is and of the dread probability that you will soon be cast into it now Spurgeon you know you can tell he's after Souls he's taken that soul and he's hanging it over the Flames of hell and you know this is shock preaching is is you know is what it was to me and he finishes he says reader suppose you should die unsaved your doom no man can even picture write out your dread estate in tears and blood talk of it with groans and nashing of teeth you will be punished with Everlasting destruction from the glory of the Lord and from the glory of his power a Brother's voice would Fain startle you into earnestness oh be wise be wise in time and a another year begins believe in Jesus who is able to save to the uttermost consecrate these last hours of this year to lonely thought and if deep repentance be bred in you it will be well and if it leads you to a humble faith in Jesus Christ it will be best of all oh see to it that this year passed not away and you still and un forgiven spirit let not the New Year's midnight peels sound upon a joyless spirit now now now and and and the third Now is really a big now believe and live and then he finishes he says Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou at in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed you know you know things like like that those are the kind of preaching that I heard in the Baptist Church I had a I I had a a a preacher's name was JC Mitchell and if he was a fire brand and I loved it you know to me you know I had been cleaned of so many things and I was so ha I was just so happy to be free I was just so happy to know that I was on my way to heaven even though you know I was a nehy I I was a novice with the word but what I knew about the word I believed in the word word and I knew that whatever else I needed to know that God was going to lead me and every time every time when I left the Catholic Church my whole family I was talking to Brother Sam and sister Peggy last night and uh they were talking about you know somebody being you know real real Catholic I think sister Peggy said she saw a sign and somebody said I am 100% Catholic well I had a grandmother she was 200% Catholic and she walked around with her prayer beads all day long saying lay in the rosaries and uh when I left the Catholic church and uh you know and and she found out that I'd become a Protestant you know she was Ernie and I was her first grandson and you know there was a love between us and she said how can you leave the mother church and suffered that persecution then you know when I when I left the Baptist Church and went to the Assembly of God Church oh you know you're that that's all of the devil over there all that speaking in tongues and all all that stuff all that healing you know you know what I found out about the Baptist they don't have any problem praying for the sick as long as you don't get well see and and and and so then I was in the Assembly of God Church everything was going well and then I got heavily involved with the Full Gospel businessmen and I wound up at Jim Baker's Bible school down at PTL and and then you know I out of out of you know the Assembly of God and the Pentecostal charismatic movement I'm into the the up see and all my charismatic friends that oh you're you're an ult and you're you're a Jesus only and you're a Oneness and you know you're a legalist and you know all those things because every time I found new light I wanted to share it I wanted to take as many people who had helped me in in in that realm that they had brought me to and and God was showing me more light and I wanted to bring them with me but whether they were coming or not I was going right if I was all by myself I I was going and finally you know when when I when when I finally encountered the message and I tried to tell the UPC preacher oh my you you want to talk about fire and fury I mean he just blasted me with every kind of a reason why I should run as far away from this message as possible he said why he said don't you know brother brandom he he he tries to make the Bible a pornographic book you know what he talks about in in in in in in Genesis you know what he talks about in Genesis 3 he said what he said that's that's crazy you know and here's a guy who memorized he had the whole Bible memorized took him 16 years memorize the Bible preach like a machine gun and never even had to pick up the Bible and I would get his tape and I would listen to it every chapter every I mean every he would wrote chapters and he' go back to the Old Testament New Testament I mean I to this day I've never seen anybody preach with that kind of fire and accuracy but the sad thing is he was lost in Genesis 3 right he never when he couldn't see Genesis 3 everything else he was off he was like you know Brother Sam was talking about you know taking a gun and and and you know sighting that that gun in well his gun got way off Genesis three gone now you know in in the state of Georgia I would I would guess there thousands and thousands maybe tens of thousands of churches in in in the state of Georgia and uh this morning there were pastors who got behind the sacred desk and they had they had prayed they'd studied they got some real good illustrations made some real good points and the people came and they expected that they were going to hear from a man of God so everything was set up and the man he preached his message and maybe the people rejoice shouted and you know went out went out to the you know H have some food after and so everything was fine and they thought their Sunday had just gone wonderfully they'd been in church they'd heard the word of God but of all the churches and all the sermons that were preached now I'm just talking about just in Georgia tens of thousands of sermons were preached but do you know not one not one person in all those sermons not one person ever receive the new birth not one unless it was a message church it's impossible I want to say it's impossible to receive the new birth outside of this message brother brandom said the only evidence that somebody truly has the Holy Ghost is that they can receive the message for their day and manifest the life that's the big key manifesting the life and and and often times the reason why people can't manifest the life is that they don't understands themselves people are confused they're frustrated you know the're they've got anxiety they've got fear they're they're afraid of the future and and now you know so many people they're trembling about Eboli and they're trembling about you know Isis over there and I mean they got so many things on their mind and the problem is they have sat in front of the pacifier called the television set they've sat in front of the pacifier too long and instead of being pacified whether it's CNN or Fox News or somebody you know I mean those people they believe in shock journalism oh yeah I mean to them when something when news comes in when a plane crashes or they have a shooting in some school man we got it you know we got we got headlines we got we got the audience our ratings are going to go up see and that's all they think about but we have to understand who we are and how we are wired and it took a prophet to tell us how we are wired C could we put that little uh little diagram up on the on the board you see brother brandom talked about us being a a Triune be being and uh you know a good illustration is like an egg now on the egg we can see the outside of the egg we can see the shell and by revelation we know that if you crack that egg you're going to see the egg yolk and you're going to see the egg white that they're going to be they're going to be there we know that now the human being is the same way we have got an outer we've got an outer shell and we've got our eyes our ears our taste touch smell now see your eyes what a precious gift eyesight is you know with your eyes you can behold the beauty of nature you can behold the beauty of a little child and and and how the child you know when they smile and when they make their first steps and everything is new to them everything is is exciting their imagination is going wild making new discoveries and we just look at that and we're able to enter into vicariously we can re we we can become like a little child our s when we're around the little children and so our eyes our eyes can behold the beauty of what's in the word our eyes can behold the beauty of what's in the in the message so our eyes can be used for so many things you can behold the beauty of Nature Flowers we have places up uh up in Vancouver bushart Gardens I mean it it looks like the Garden of Eden up there it's it's just so breathtaking and we can behold the beauty of of of of of of the moon sometimes when it comes down real close and when it gets full so there's so many things now I've got a friend of mine and he's blind and and he went blind in a in a hunting accident when he was N9 years old his name is Dick mailman and uh he's a preacher now he's a preacher down in Altamont Springs just outside of Orlando but when I met him we were in business together and and he was a speaker he was a motivational speaker a blind motivational speaker but the thing is he had had the sensation of seeing when he was a young child so he could move and you know and and and and he had a perception I mean he could turn he could be speaking to you and he'd turn around and he'd get that chalk and he go right on the chalkboard and people that guy's not blind they just put they're just telling us that he's not blind and so you know we spent a lot of time together and we had you know we had seminars that we were doing in Daytona Beach in Orlando and Tampa and then down in Palm Beach and often times when we were going I had the opportunity to drive and I mean I was like a sponge this guy had so much knowledge and so much insight into human nature and so I asked him one day I said dick I said I said you know you've had the sensation of seeing I said what would it be what would it be like for you if Medical Technology were ever able to advance to the point where you could see again and he said well Ernie he says uh he said you know I I I'd love to see again he said I've never seen my wife I have three children I've never seen my children I've never seen my dog I've never seen my house you know and he started name and all the things that he hadn't seen he said but he said there would be a danger there would be a danger if I could ever see again because he said I've known so many people and he says and they judge people like somebody says you can't judge a book by the cover he said well many people they judge your book by the cover he said right now he said when I meet somebody he said I don't know if that per you know maybe I can guess but I don't know if the person how old the person they may be 20 or they may be 40 they may be 50 or 60 I don't know he says I don't I don't know if the person is attractive or not attractive I don't know I don't know what color they are he said I don't know if they're short or tall he all these things I don't know he said but I have I I I have a perception he said I have a sense he said and and he called it you know he called it a secret sense I have a secret sense where if I'm around somebody for a few minutes he said I can feel whether or not this person is going to be somebody who is going to to be an asset to me somebody who's going to be a blessing to me somebody that I can fellowship with somebody that we're going to have good companionship or whether it's somebody that you know maybe not you know maybe I should just keep my distance from this person and he said and I would hate to ever have to go to the point where just because I had my eyes back I would prejudge people and he said and maybe because because of their age or because of the way they look or or or whatever he said I may prejudge that person and there may be a beautiful kernel of love in that person that God wants to bless me with and yet I might miss it because oh they're too old H they're not attractive you know I mean they're what have I got to be you know attracted to that person by and so a lot of people they judge and and they misuse their eyes and many people they misuse their eyes they read the wrong things they read the wrong magazines they read the wrong books they watch television they go to movies magazines Sports you know that's their end all Beall you know what the Georgia Bulldogs did this week or or what the Atlanta Falcons did you know or or going to do and uh you know every state is like that last year we had Seahawk Mania up in Washington I mean you you couldn't go anywhere and and you know they've got a thing where the the stadium it rocks you know and and and they've set world records for having the loudest stadium the loudest fans in there and and then Kansas City they went back and forth well they call that the 12th man now I don't know you know football doesn't interest me at all but if you're if you're living in Washington you know what the 12th man is and everywhere you go you got people with their jerseys on Seahawks Journey 12 man you go there they got automobiles 12 everything is 12 12 12 12 12 now if you just went into Washington you went from New York or somewhere and you went you say what in the world are all these twelves about but if you live there you know what it's all about so people you know they give thems over to TV stars movie stars sports stars rock stars business Stars political stars but I can tell you one thing without the holy ho ghost they're all fallen stars and yet people give their time and they give their attention and they give their money and their resources and they take their children and they sacrifice their children on the altar of entertainment and they make their children a sports fan they make their children a music fan or what whatever is you know whatever Mom and Dad are interested in they're passing down to their children whether they know it or not because children are very very perceptive so our eyes are a wonderful gift that can be used or it can be abused I'm so thankful that I've got eyes to see and now we go to our ears we've got ears to hear and think of all the wonderful things that we can do with our ears the things we hear the singing the in the church today was wonderful I love hearing people sing good songs music anointed songs I love being able to communicate with people I would hate to have to you know be deaf and have to everything be going like this or going like you know I I I I see up in New York in in New York City Anytime they have any kind of a government a government uh meeting they always have a signer there they have like the governor or the mayor or whoever he is and they always have you know the the uh the fans in the back there all the people that to be seen in the background and then they got the signer and the sign and you know I appreciate the fact but I am so thankful that I've got ears but many people they misuse their ears they misuse their ears by listening to gossip listening to the wrong things listening to the wrong music and also all of the entertainment and all the the uh the educational programs that that that that that are presented to them they don't put a filter on their ears now brother brandham said nothing wrong with education but many people will make education a God and they cannot get enough they cannot get enough seminars they cannot get enough insight into what's going on in politics and you know in the next couple of days you know the the the the uh the the TV news headlines I mean it's going to be just working on overtime who's going to win is it the Republicans is it the Democrats this state here it's at a razor thin margin here you know and they're spending so many millions of dollars and they got the you know it's it's bizarre I want to tell you when I was in North Carolina I walked into a print shop and when I walked into the print shop i s sit at the counter and I looked up there and the guy had a big giant Banner in the banner it said politics and he had it p o l i hyphen TI I Cs and underneath it it said poly means many ticks means parasites so politics equals many parasites all feeding from the public door see and and yet people get so they get so riled up you know I'm a Democrat I was born a Democrat I'm going to die a Democrat I was born a republican I'm going die Republican other words I'm independent you know I'm I don't go either way or I'll go both ways you know whatever it is and so we've got to watch listen now we've got to watch what goes into our eyes or ears because once you make a conscious decision to allow something into your eyes or ears it takes a journey to the back road of your mind and there in the back road of your mind is produced thoughts sometimes hundreds of thoughts while you're watching a movie or while you're watching you know the news thoughts and those thoughts they become words we hear it and then we repeat it you know the average person the average person has 10,000 thoughts a day go through their mind but you know what the problem is 9,000 plus of those thoughts that go through your mind today are the same 9,000 thoughts that went through your mind yesterday it's like your your mind is like it's on a loop you're worried about the bills worried about the kids worried about school worry about the and those thoughts go round and round and round and round and so you when it comes in your eyes or ears it it goes to your mind it produces a thought thoughts produce words words produce actions actions form habits habits produces character and character determines your destiny so we've got to watch our eyes and watch our our ears and then we come to our taste and and our smell and uh I did I didn't know it until yesterday I I was talking to Brother Sam and I gave him something that I Ed to to kind of clean out my sinuses once in a while and he said well I can't smell and I didn't know it I didn't know that but but I do know there are many people who cannot smell and there are many people believe it or not they cannot taste medicine sometimes has caused them to lose their taste buds or different things have have happened to them so ice cream tastes like potatoes or potatoes taste like you know it it's all the same they just eat they eat because they have to eat to live right but they can't taste it could you imagine could you imagine eating and not being able to taste good food and yet there are some PE so so we are blessed with our sense of smell we are blessed with our sense of of of of of taste I love the tast I I I love ethnic food I love Chinese food Japanese food thai food Mexican food Italian food Greek food you know I I love it all I've got a missionary stomach I I I just love any I can eat anything except liver oh my and I was in the Philippines one time and and they had a soup and the soup was delicious and I was eating that soup and all of a sudden I took a bite of something it was and I mean I have no control over it but if liver goes to my taste buds it automatically ejects my body rejects it and the food comes it ejects and I have to hurry up and try to catch it you know in a napkin or in my hands or something to avoid a big embarrassment so so our taste and our smell that they they're gifts we don't you know we don't we don't say Lord thank you for my sense of taste thank you for my sense of smell you know thank you for my eyes thank you for my ears but these are all gifts and some people are blind some people are deaf some people can't smell some people can't taste and then there are people and then we we go to the sensation of our touch now it's wonderful you know when when you're in love and and you have your sweetheart and you want to hold hands or you want to you know just walk down the you know the street you know and and just have a good conversation and you know many other things go with the benefits of of being married but other people they abuse their sense of touch and Satan has anointed them and anointed their sensation of touch and and and they use it and basically it just becomes raw Heathen lust is what it becomes and they want to go out with this one for a while and then go out with this one for a while and go out you know I want to touch this one I want to touch that one I want to be with this one and and so these are all the you know I say our shell our our our eggshell but now that's just the first part of who we are and many people you know that's basically what governs their life if it looks good they want to look at it if it sounds good they want to listen to it if it tastes and smells good they want to eat it and a lot of times they eat you know and gets in trouble they get them themselves in trouble and they wind up with you know with sicknesses and illnesses and diseases I I know a brother precious brother a brother I love been in this church many times we Fellowship all the time but this brother he's got sugar diabetes and he cannot control his taste buds he loves sugar even though he knows it's destroying his body his legs are literally turning black he's had a heart attack he's had a stroke and he's got a big church one of the biggest churches in the Philippines and everybody his wife his brother who's also a pastor his children all of them you know the deacons of of his church you know they they try to you know go with him when he eats and when he goes and he orders that hot fudge Sunday you know they try to they try to put the stop on it but he he won't hear he knows he knows it's detrimental to him but he is so Bound by that taste sensation and some people are bound by the touch sensation see and so you know if it feels good they want to do it yeah so so basically just as a review you if it looks good look at it if it sounds good they want to listen to it smells good tastes good they want to they want to eat it feels good want to do it and those are people who live after the flesh they are governed after the flesh this is the first realm and the first realm it's not a royal realm and I can tell you with with with with wi with all sincerity you are only as safe as the realm or the domain that you choose to live in and you've got to bring that you know many people they think well you know I'm a human being and I've come to Earth to have a spiritual experience that's not right you believe it or not you are a supernatural being and you've come to Earth to have a human experience and and your mission your mandate in life is to overcome that Human Experience is overcome your eyes ears taste touch and smell so you so so you you're in control so now let's go into the second realm we go into the realm of the mind and and in the mind the first one is your conscience now I am so thankful if if all this message did for for all of us was to give us a revelation of justification and the Sea of God's forgetfulness but I mean we are eons of miles ahead of anybody in any other church because you know their salvation usually last from one service to the next service and sometime from Sunday to Monday you know and right away they're back you know you know people they they are anybody ever had a bad boss work with a bad boss you know what the worst boss is it's a bad habit and bad habits get you in trouble and people you know they they they do it to themselves they they make choices they make decisions that they know are destructive they know they've done it in the past but they want to do it again and so I I compare it to a guy who gets a rope and he ties two loops around the rope and one Loop he ties here the other one he ties here and he just starts kicking himself every day he goes out and he makes the same mistake that he made yesterday I know I shouldn't do it but I'm going to do it anyways I know I shouldn't be here but I'm going anyways you know I know I shouldn't go to the movie show but you know I just want to this one movie I want to see see and so they beat themsel up this a guy one time he said it was a general he said we have identified the enemy and he is me so we don't want to be our own enemy we want the Holy Ghost to to to to be our friend and the Holy Ghost to govern us and and and so in the mind and the conscience real your conscience it can be so clean and so clear because the purity of a word has has has has called you out and selected you to be one of the few who can receive true justification true freedom from all Sin from all guilt from all shame from all condemnation and you can walk with a bounce in your step you can walk and say I got the token you know I packed the token in me you know and and you know I say that all the time so thankful for the token so thankful for the token and when I talk to my mom I talk to my my sisters I talk to my relative I want that token to be on display I want to be like David he says I place the lord always before me always before me what I say I want the Lord I the Lord is with me I want the Lord to be able to walk with me I want the Lord to be able to talk and be able to be pleased with what I say and so other people it's the the the Devil comes and the devil brings up your past he brings up all the mistakes you've ever made and so I I encourage people and I might have said this before might have probably did but I encourage people to get a notepad and and you got to get a not pad and you got to get a shovel and you got to get a match and you got to get a rock and some red paint and a paintbrush okay now the first thing you do is you write down all your sins all your mistakes all your failures all your disappointments all the rejection all the hatred bigotry Prejudice misunderstand just write write down everything that you can remember as far back now this is for your eyes only okay it's supernaturally classified only for you no nobody else can see this okay now when you finished then you go get a shovel and you dig a hole then you get a match and you light it on fire and you just drop it down into the the the hole and you cover it up and you get that rock little gravestone maybe about that size put it on there then you go get the red paint and the paintbrush and you put rest in peace and you have a formal funeral for your p am and it is say I am just taking and I am manifesting my justification I am manifesting that my seas are in the sea of God's forgetfulness and every time those hounds of hell those demons of Doubt try to come and assault you and bring up your past you say Satan you are a liar I've got a prophet word that says I'm free I got a prophet word that says when the weakest Christian gets on his knees that the demons begin to tremble so devil start trembling just start trembling you know did did do you ever take that seriously that in that realm that's all around us you know Satan Satan or or his imps they are listening to everything that you say I don't know if they got if they got a supernatural uh uh computer that keeps track of of everything you say and everything you do but they're listening and if you start talking about your weaknesses or your fears or your anxieties or your problem oh that's a good one write that one down we can use that one then they'll go and they'll get two or three or four more imps and they'll come and you can feel you can feel that presence when they come and they try to get a sneak attack on you oh yeah and the thing you need to do is stand when you've done all the stand just stand you know the devil he the devil can't make me raise my arm the devil can't make me do anything we choose to do it choice choice is one of the greatest powers that God has put into the hands of a human being you've got a choice you've got a choice to go to prayer you've got a choice to put on a a CD or a DVD or or any one of the other channels that we've got to listen to the message now you've got a choice if you want if you got a choice to go and witness of somebody all these things are choices every one of us has got 24 hours in a day nobody gets 23 nobody gets 25 it's what we do with those hours it's the choices and decisions and those choices and decisions they become either Positive Choices or negative choices positive decisions or negative decisions and there are consequences to each one often time you know many time brother brandom talked about the sin of om it's not that you went out and committed the sin it's that you didn't do what God opened up a door for you to do or you felt that nudge of the Holy Ghost and yet we didn't do it so now that's our conscience okay now we go to the next compartment it's like we go to the next floor and the next floor it's our imagination our imagination is one of the greatest and most powerful gifts that we've that that you could ever imagine you know you look at the skyscraper you know in downtown Atlanta or if you go to New York City all those buildings they were they were in somebody's mind all the engineering that had to be done all the wiring that had to be done all all the phones that had to be put in I mean it's just amazing all the plumbing that had to be done and somebody just sat down and somebody just wrote it down somebody designed it and they gave it to somebody who was a contractor contract okay I can do that and he goes there he gets the workers and the workers start digging or they bring in the equipment next thing you know there's a hole in the ground and the walls start going up and the floors start going up and next thing you know you know it's for rent you know come on in do your business here and it's incredible you see the boats that they build oh my it's just amazing some of these battleships they it was in somebody's mind before it was ever in the water so so our our our imagination I call mine the station of Creation in my imagination it's a dream machine see your imag and and you got to exercise your imagination right exercise it in things that are good and true and holy and positive things that are going to be a blessing to you and to other people see and so other people they use their imagination and I mean the devil uses their imagination and they watch so much television and movies and and they get so many video games and they're sitting there sometime you know sometimes they've said people have sat in front of those video machines for like 48 hours straight just doing nothing but playing those and they got they got places for people who who like to have people for for drug rehabilitation or alcohol rehabilitation they've got people who have to go to internet Rehabilitation because they can't pull them themselves out from behind the computer and their mind they don't have have any social skills they're socially awkward when they try to interact with human being because they're so used to interacting with the computer interacting with the mouse interacting boom boom boom boom boom boom shoot him shoot them kill him kill them kill them you know and oh my I killed 25 today I'm going to kill more tomorrow and so it's like they're they're actually their mind and Google is coming up you know I I I hear these Google Glasses I don't know how they work but I can tell you I don't want any part of it I don't want to go into a alternate reality I'm happy with the supernatural reality that God has given to me see and so your imagination it can be used positively or negatively I want to use mine for God I see because the the the the the the realm the domain the dimension that we're going into it's a supernatural Dimension and I want to practice I want to pract somebody said practice makes perfect I said no know perfect practice makes perfect right and I want to practice perfectly what the world that we're going into is going to be a faith civilization so I want my faith to grow I want my I want to meditate you know I start meditating and sometimes we have our mind has to be quickened to the fact like I'll Quicken you to a fact many of us maybe never thought of it but right now in this building there are supernatural angels in this building right now brother brandom said they're here to help out in the meetings right and brother BR said when you feel when that sweet presence comes in when the anointing comes in you know and people get to the point where almost drunk in the spirit and brother brand said that's Angels we're brushing up against angels unaware we're not aware of it but by a prophet's word we know and and I welcome the angels that are in this building I pray that they will do and and have have free Liberty to do whatever it is that they want to do with each one of us okay so now that's our imagination the next one we go to conscience imagination reasoning you know so many people they get trapped because they want to understand everything Brother P there's no way you can understand God if you could understand him you wouldn't need faith and so by faith we by faith we believe God by faith we understand the Promises by faith we understand that that Bible with 66 books with 40 40 different authors Wroten uh you know so many years apart I forget how many years a part of this but it all just comes together it fits like a glove so people say I got to figure it out well you know the Bible says the Bible says cast down reasoning right cast down down memory cast down imagination cast down everything that exalted itself against the knowledge of God now don't cast down your memory or your imagination if it's positive if it's productive and then we we have the realm of of our affections you have the realm of your affection and that's such a beautiful thing a beautiful thing you know I heard somebody talking talking about love and they were talking about puppy love anybody ever experienced puppy love when you were young I did I did you know what they say about puppy they say life is one fool thing after another and puppy love is two fool things Chas chasing each other see and and so affections can be wonderful exhilarating intoxicating I mean you know all as you can see all you can see is the one if it's true if it's holy if it's if it's God pointing out to you this is this is this is the one that I prepared for you my there's no feeling like that in the whole world it's a revelation that God gives you see my Revelation is that Christ is my bridegroom and and my my bridegroom my husband has never made a mistake how many of you can say that how many of you ladies that are married can say that my husband never made a mistake well you just have to override the first one and go to the Eternal one he never he never made a mistake now now now here how many can remember how many can remember the first time you ever got your heartbroken you were just head over heels in love there's nobody like her there's nobody like him I'm so lucky I'm so blessed I'm so fortunate this is like the world oh I just can't believe I can't believe that he loves me I can't believe that she loves me and then all of a sudden the day comes and he comes in he said I got to talk to you or she comes in I got to talk to you said uh I believe we need to go our separate way I I I I believe we need to take some time I believe we need a little space in other words what they're saying and and what it finally comes to is I don't want you anymore I don't need you anymore and and you know what it feels like it feels like somebody took your heart and they took your heart and they ripped it out of your chest and they threw it on the ground and then they spit on it and then they stopped on it they said I don't love you anymore I don't want you anymore I don't want to see you anymore I don't want to hear about you anymore oh I can't believe my world's coming to an end oh you have your poor me party woe is me nobody's got it so rough as me nobody's ever felt like this before I'm never going to be the same oh it's a big one it's a big one you know and then you know they go into their bedroom and they lock their door and they shut off the lights and they laid down am I speaking anybody remember that those days I've been through it a few times and you know I've caused it a few times too and you know at that time you know I wasn't I wasn't a Christian I was carnal all I cared about was what was going to make me happy you know and just so happens that she doesn't make me happy anymore so she's got to go and I'll find another one yeah and so they hide in the room and Mom and Dad try to come in and reason with them oh there'll be another one one and then the old oh there's a lot of fish in the sea you know that's going to help all as you can see is one fish in the sea and that fish just slipped off the hook and swam away he and so you know Godly affection or heartbreak affection it depends upon what you set your heart on the Bible said set your heart on things above right that's where we need to set our our desires on have have have strong desire but let them be Supernatural desires spiritual desires things that that that that when they come to pass are going to be a positive a positive move in the right direction a positive move towards Christ a positive move towards the cross a positive move towards becoming the person that God designed us to be but we've got to understand those things and some you know they say the problem with with with youth is that is wasted on the young you know I would love I I would give everything those of you who are young here today uh those of you who are 30 years and under I'll say you know anybody who gets up to you know up to 60 and 70 if we had the opportunity we would give everything that we have all our possessions all our belongings if I could just go back and be 18 years old again or 20 years old again just just give me the clothes on my back just give me a little apartment and a beat up car and let me start all over again but I need to I need to retain the knowledge that I have now at 60 years old I need to retain the knowledge but I want a young body I want to go back and be able to live it over we don't get that chance friends but through years we we gain experience we gain knowledge we know what's right we know what's wrong and and we understand God you know if a person follows the Bible and and and is dedicated to Christ you know that each step along the way it it it just you know you you're able to comprehend things at a much higher level at a level that young people could never understand but they're growing and and and and we are examples to them the young people are watching us they're watching brother Dale they're watching sister Dale they're watching the deacons they're watching the trustees they're watching you know brothers and sisters see and and so our affections oh my how we need to guard those affections we are the only people in the world who can set our affections on the message we're the only people in the world who understand the seven Church ages understand the Seven Seals we're the only people in the world who know what the future home of the Heavenly bride and bridegroom is we're the only ones who can understand the anointed ones at the end time could you imagine if God had not had brother Brandon preached that message and we'd be saying well I don't understand that they got signs wonders Miracles and people are getting healed and and they could be over Africa where brother brandham said they could make tables levitate and make the pen just jump up in the air and write something down with a pen nobody touching the pen the pen would just write down and it be true how could we understand those things but Satan you know Satan is not afraid of the supernatural Satan operates in the Supernatural he's a supernatural being and he's had 6,000 years him and all of his fallen angels have had 6,000 years practicing how to pollute your your imagination and your conscience and your memory and your reasons and your affections so now we go to the last one for me it's the most precious one it's our memory and you know when you think on what God has done when you think on on how in 1906 six God had a plan and he planted that prophet in in in in in Kentucky and he raised them up and we can meditate on all the experiences that he had and how God had to teach him lessons sometimes hard lessons even to the point where you know where he was going to commit suicide you know going to take a hold of that pole even times when because of his anger he that guy that poisoned his dog he he had the gun getting ready to shoot that guy and the gun wouldn't fire later on it fired perfectly and brother Brandon because he was poor because he wore the same coat every day he was he was bullied in school and the kids picked on him and one day he had enough and he got his gun and he hid behind the bushes and he waited for the gang that was bullying him and he jumped out he said Okay who wants to die first and the gun wouldn't fire my I mean just so many things what he had to go through with his W with his first wife and how he lost his little girl and how Satan came he said are you still going to serve him after he took your wife he took your little girl and and are you still going to serve him and you know I mean that was a b the greatest battle ever fought for him at that point in time but he had to think back for all the things that God had done for him all the promises that are in the word all things work together for good for those that love God unfortunately there are people you know there are going to be people in my church this year that won't be there next year some are just going to leave some are going to backslide some are going to die you know they're not going to be there and so I want to appreciate people while they're here and I've got such Precious Memories you know every once in a while I just push my memory button and I go back and I just think about my own testimony how I got from the Catholic Church to the message and how I had to to meet brother Arie and what I had to go through and that whole and I just I just relive it in the imagination I relive it sitting in brother Bear's living room and brother Arie going out there and coming back and wanting to preach the message to to him and had to go out there and and get on you know get on the highway and just so angry and and have him get out of the car and get on the bus leave me alone with I mean you know crazy I mean you know if I wrote a book and asked somebody to believe that they wouldn't believe it totally supern God was doing that amen and I'm so thankful that I I I came through the way that I did but you know I I mean my pastor when I when I told my pastor brother bisco when I was moving up to Cloverdale he said brother and he says give me your testimony so I gave my testimony and he said wow he said I've never heard anything like that before so the next year brother Arie came up so we're we're we're staying at brother Ed's house and brother Ed said brother Arie he said would you mind giving me your testimony how you met brother Ernie so brother Arnie said oh brother Ed I don't want to do that you know oh you you know it's too embarr no brother it's okay brother Arie come on go yeah I want I just I just want to hear it and so brother Arie he gave the same testimony and brother Ed came to me he said brother Ernie he said if there is anybody in the whole whole world that should believe in extreme predestination it's you and see each one of us we were predestinated to go a certain path and we can take our imagination and our memory and and and we can go back and we can relive the positive and we can forget the negative but then F so so that's the second realm but the second realm it's not a holy realm it's not a royal realm it's not an eternal realm see one day if the Rapture doesn't take us one day and you know it's sometime it sounds crude but brother brandom said it one day the maggots and the skin worms are going to be crawling through your flesh some of them are going to be eating heart some of they going to be eating lungs some of they going to be eating thighs some of them I don't know how they taste but some of them are going to beaten my toes oh my liver oh just thinking about it makes my liver quiver you know but but you know someday if if if I if if we don't go the way of the Rapture that's what's going to happen you know they said if you take a man and put a man in a box and seal that box airtight so nothing can get in and nothing can get out and you come back uh you know a little while later and those those skin worms are going to be crawling all through that through that body see and so the first realm it's not an eternal realm the second realm our our our mind it's not an eternal realm but we're only as safe as the realm that we choose to live in but when we get transferred into the Third Realm we get transferred into the realm of the holy of holy that's the bedroom out here is the kitchen out here is the living room but in here is the holy of hly and that can only bring you in by the Third pole it's like the outer court and the inner Court then the holy of holies and again you're only as safe as the realm or the dimension that you choose to live in by choice I choose to live in that realm where brother brandom said you get in that realm he said have you ever met somebody who's been in that in that Holy of holy is so sweet it's so kind so gentle so so caring so humble you know they they they've been with God and and when you really spend time with God it changes you see we say I'm a human being no you're a human becoming you're a human becoming a supernatural being and when you live in that realm my all the other things you know the the the outer realm the inner realm all your five gates here your five gates here everything passes away way and all that all that counts is that God has given you the privilege to live in that inner secret chamber where the shakina glory is all around you it saturates your being it changes you it transforms you it takes you on a paradigm shift you go from being you know some people you know that they're naturally negative and pessimistic but God changes them and they become positive POS and optimistic it's the word that does it and remember only the word only this message can transfer somebody nobody else there's not going to be any Baptist in this holy real they not going to be any Presbyterians or lutherans or Catholics now you know God may God may know something about them they may give a glass of water to somebody in the bride and they may be with us in heaven but they're not going to be bride there's no possibility for them to become bride they have to either die or go through the tribulation one or the other and if if they're a foolish virgin in the tribulation they're going to be hunted down like dogs and they're going to have to give their life for their faith or they'll compromise and they'll say well you know I I'll just kind of try to work within the system you know that that's death death God God gives us life he says choose life choose Zoe life eternal life positive life and choose to share it with everybody else live it breathe it manifest it share it become who God has designed us to be and God has designed us all to go through all these experiences all these experiences but our ultimate destination is here and brother brandham said and I believe it that you can get so close and so deep in here that the devil cannot even find you isn't that what we all want we want to be in the place where the devil cannot even find us God bless you Saint let's stand to our feet amen how many would say I I I want to be given that sacred access into the holy of holies I want to live there I want to stay there I want to bring as many people as possible I want my family there with me I I want maybe those who I've had the opportunity to work with I want them to be with me I want all all that I know and all that I love and and all that God brings my way I want to bring them in this is not something you know it's just me and mine and that'll be fine or just me and us for and no more that's not that's not the kind of gospel that we preach if you're a real Christian you want you want that Christianity to explode you want your life people come into your your presence and they feel an atmosphere we had the principal in our school I mean the the the the supervisors who come in and they check out the you know the Christian schools and believe they get real real picky about Christian schools and they want to go there they want to make sure the library is right they want to make sure that the lab is right and the computers are right and these children are being given access to a first first class education because fortunately in Canada where our school is the Canadian government pays for half of the tuition for that student so they come and they're inspecting and and and and they wrote a letter and uh you know they just sent me the letter the other day and these inspectors in the letter they said you you should be proud of your school you should be proud of the teachers you have you should be proud of the way your children conducts and they even said there is an atmosphere in your building that we've never felt before see it it's God it's God living in those children God living in those teachers God manifest his presence it's so wonderful when you come to a church and you know that church has been bathed in prayer the service has been bathed in prayer the pastor has been before God the pastor or the minister whoever it is they have been in that that that chamber there and they're just waiting on God waiting for the inspiration waiting for a thought to come waiting for a verse to come waiting for a part of the message to open up to them and then as they sit down and they write something else comes along something else comes along something else comes along alone you know and and and and and we've got such a resource of the you know many people the only resource that they really have is they use the Bible or they'll try to go back and see something that Spurgeon wrote you know try to get one of his sermons but we've got access to over 1,00 Masterpiece messages and we're able to draw from them you know it's like a supernatural morgage board right you know and God has given it to us and everybody has access to it but the question is as I close the question is do we choose do we choose to use our eyes our ears our taste our smell our touch do we choose to use them for the kingdom of God do we choose to use our conscience and our memory and our imagination and our reasoning and our F do we choose to use them to shut out the world to shut out all the enticements to shut out all the allurements and turn and believe me sometimes you know sometimes you need to fight the devil's going to fight you to get you know to get into the kingdom of God to get into the presence of God you know there's going to be Warfare daily Warfare if you're a Believer Satan he's he he he's around you or his imps Fallen Spirit they're around you you 247 365 and if you're a Believer when you wake up in the morning you got a big old Bullseye on your back and every demon in the area knows who you are know your address your phone number your email account your Twitter account and whatever else is out there in that in that realm you know so so so we've got to be on guard every day first thing in the morning put on the whole armor of God take that helmet consciously helmet put on the helmet put on the breastplate have your loins G about with truth have your feet shed with the preparation of the gospel of peace and have that sword and have that Shield say Lord I'm going out for Warfare today I'm going to fight with the devil you know you know what I know every day I know there's got to be two deaths I got to die and the devil's going to die and it's my privilege to drive a spear or a sword right through his neck every day and you do it by overcoming Power Glory that has been implanted in Us by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost living inside of you instructing you nudging you opening a door closing a door giving you that inspiration your mind becomes a breeding ground for Supernatural thoughts your mind becomes your mind is a fertile bedding ground and whatever thoughts that you plant in your mind that's what's going to come up I want to plant spiritual seeds I want the supernatural to come as a manifestation of the choices that I make let's bow our heads father we thank you for the instruction that you've given to us we thank than you for a people that would sit and that would hear and listen and that would see the spirit of God moving in their midst moving them trying to position them into that holy of holies into that Third Realm that Holy realm the place where that the there there's life eternal life it's like Aaron's Rod that budded oh God we want a bud we want our life to bloom brother brandham said the tree of life is blooming inside those who follow this message I want to ask your friends I want to ask you how many would say Lord and and all all heads are are are bowed please eyes closed how many would say Lord I want to spend more time in that holy of holies God bless you God bless you my hands both my hands are up I can tell you I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ I'm not ashamed I want to humble myself I want I if if I have to walk through shads of of glass the rest of my life I if if it meant achieving Heaven I would I would want to do it because the option is horrible even to contemplate Lord I Thank you for this congregate I thank you for Brother Sam and sister Peggy and the example they set for brother Wade and and and the spirit that's on my precious brother I pray that you'd bless his ministry open doors for him to go out and share the joy and the zest of life that he has father bless brother teren bless the deacons bless the trustees bless all those who sing father who who who create the atmosphere Lord we just have so much to be thankful for I just want to thank you for the opp opportunity to be here to be able to travel again to be able to see friends and people that I love and people that I know that that love me and that have shown it in so many ways even to the point of the suit that I have on my back Lord came from this church and I'm just thankful for it so Lord bless those that have raised their hands and give them insight and wisdom maybe wisdom they've never had before as to how to get how how to get away from the world how to prioritize their time how to H how to say Lord I'm going to spend time I'm going to spend more time in prayer I'm G to I'm going to spend more time reading your message I'm going to spend more time reading your Bible I'm going to spend more time witnessing oh God the body of Christ brother Bram said when she fully realizes who she is then will be gone thank you Lord for that promise we ask all these blessings bless your people give them the desires of their heart in Jesus precious name amen God bless you Brother Sam amen love you buddy amen let's give our brother a good hand well that is that's the way it is it's speaking of our life that's right amen our beings and what we are getting into that place to come to place to even be worthy to participate in know communion and you know and realize know what's going on because we come through that memory reason conscience and things but we got to get inside he's got to get inside CU that's where I like what brother R said it say he said it's faith or doubt he didn't say faith doubt they they made a drawing one time one did on this and we deliberately added the word r in the middle of it because it was just Faith doubt so that could mean either one of them I mean both of them be present at the same time but so we kind of touched up their drawing and put o in the middle you know cuz that's the way brother R said it's Faith or doubt because they can't be in our together that's right one's got to get out for the other and so we appreciate it just tell our brother how much you appreciate him coming down and being with us and we just appreciate him when he come out yesterday and come up walking I said good to see you home walking walking because that's am I I've never been in hurting of that you know but I knew that there was a lot of lot of doings and the Lord had to take care of a lot of things you say well you know why can't we just believe take care of I think we do amen I was telling brother Ernie we were talking about it you know you remember the man that or whoever it was and brother randam would stand there talking why didn't he just pray for him Lord he said you got a stomach problem said there's a doctor down here that specializes in that kind of operation right go down here and have it done well how it comes what does it matter you know thank God for healing yes cuz only healing is in God right we thank God for that amen you just tell our brother how much you appreciate it let's let's go into the scriptures and we'll just continue with the service and how the foot Wasing communion and the foot Wasing Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which he in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in rem rembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had up saying this cup is a new testament in my blood this
