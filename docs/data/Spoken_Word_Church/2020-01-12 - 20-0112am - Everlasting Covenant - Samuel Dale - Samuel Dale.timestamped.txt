[23:26] we go into the service you under
[23:28] Undertake and have your way with each
[23:31] and every one of our hearts let your
[23:32] loving grace be with us bless us all
[23:35] together in you forgive our sins and
[23:38] lead us by thine understanding we ask it
[23:41] in Jesus name amen what have we got let
[23:45] all things be done
[23:47] decently and in order so you may be
[23:50] seated the Lord at his Blessing so you

[23:55] different it's not just a thing but uh
[24:00] we we've got kind of

[24:03] uh New Year's starting out so we'll just

[24:12] you never keep them anyway but we're
[24:14] going to try to make some to keep them
[24:16] all right so there's going to be some
[24:18] things said then we'll try to get into
[24:19] the service so I'll try to run through
[24:21] fast now remember now we're trying our
[24:24] best to be a church to serve God and to
[24:28] be right with the Lord in what we do so
[24:31] let all things be done decently and in
[24:35] order so there's an order to everything
[24:37] and the the things that we you know we
[24:40] we wonder
[24:42] and talk about there is an order to it
[24:45] okay
[24:46] now I know it's hard for you to do it
[24:49] but would you please I know I've asked
[24:52] this before and I know it's not working
[24:55] and I'm saying it won't work this time
[24:57] but I'm saying it so you're going to be
[25:00] guilty when you come in there's a sign
[25:03] down there that says turn off all cell
[25:07] phones you're not doing it you're s
[25:10] texting you're sending messages to

[25:27] three telephones that are connected line
[25:30] lined to the church and then you have

[26:12] Beats comes in so you know all right so
[26:16] take care of
[26:17] that I know here I am one Sunday after

[27:41] position then he was the problem was he
[27:44] was complaining that the services was
[27:46] too

[29:11] what's right amen you know we're not
[29:15] telling you you got a set there no we're
[29:18] telling you do what's
[29:20] right get it done before
[29:23] service you know go by the bathroom
[29:26] before service you say yeah but my my
[29:29] kids are no no you're making excuses so
[29:32] don't make not I'm being as sincere as I
[29:34] can but as loving as I can okay now if
[29:37] you don't think this is a loving way I
[29:39] can get it
[29:41] different I can bring the profit of what
[29:43] he said and read it and say you are an
[29:45] unbeliever because you're not doing this
[29:49] I'm not doing that I'm being serious I'm
[29:51] being sincere and try to do the best
[29:53] that I can all right now no one
[29:57] necessarily
[29:58] talking we shouldn't have a lot of
[30:00] talking in the sanctuary outside of what
[30:03] did the prophet say tell the person see
[30:05] you outside amen see you outside but
[30:09] I've seen some of you stop and talk and
[30:10] take on conversations while the service
[30:13] you know right at the end of the service
[30:15] that's not correct that's that's not the
[30:17] prophet said one child running through a
[30:19] church would hinder the next
[30:23] service so now if you let your child run
[30:25] through the church or you get up and
[30:26] talking and you run backwards and forth
[30:28] you do it then you hinder the next
[30:30] service now who's
[30:32] responsible hey come on Church we're
[30:34] serving a God we're not playing just try
[30:37] to go to church and be good and have a
[30:39] book of rules and and
[30:41] everything I've always said one thing
[30:43] and I believe it Christianity is not a
[30:45] rule that's right amen Christianity is a
[30:49] love of fire between us and
[30:52] God and if we want him to come in our
[30:55] services we must invite him amen amen we
[30:59] must honor him and respect
[31:02] him all right amen
[31:05] now oh no one no congregating and things
[31:09] you know and doing things and like from
[31:12] the doors back underway we can't help it
[31:15] we come up the step and I'm just as
[31:16] guilty I'm not throwing off to you I'm
[31:19] guilty we come up talking and things but
[31:22] the closer we get this way there ought
[31:23] to be a whole lot
[31:24] quieter because it's you know respecting
[31:28] this Sanctuary we ain't got a great big
[31:29] building great big thing to where we can
[31:31] do it's it's our problem but that's
[31:34] still we can handle it all right but see
[31:36] sometimes you'll hear and they we've had
[31:38] trouble back there of people
[31:42] talking right there shouldn't be over
[31:46] two people in that tape room orever
[31:49] who's
[31:50] working the dress should be out
[31:53] here this is where we were supposed to
[31:55] meet all right we play the
[31:59] tape we thought that idea would work
[32:02] good because the prophet said get to
[32:04] church what 30 minutes four
[32:06] time sit down and read your Bible and be
[32:11] quiet right waiting for the service so
[32:14] we started playing the tape of the
[32:16] Prophet for 20
[32:18] minutes for us to come in on then
[32:22] playing for 20 minutes then it switches
[32:25] over and you have live music and things
[32:28] for 10 minutes for the
[32:31] services we should honor
[32:34] that I it doesn't matter who it is we
[32:36] should come in sit down and hear the
[32:40] prophet amen amen well that's Tak it
[32:43] away
[32:46] my yeah take away your talking time
[32:49] so but remember we're supposed to be
[32:52] serving God
[32:56] Amen as I said Christian J is not a
[32:58] requirement it's a
[33:00] joy why don't you want to come in and
[33:03] hear the
[33:04] prophet get yourself out of the way get
[33:07] here
[33:08] early
[33:10] uhoh amen you sure do it at work yeah
[33:15] you do it at all other
[33:17] things let me call you up and say we'll
[33:19] go eat supper you'll be there right on
[33:23] time right well then there's no excuse
[33:26] for anything else now we're not making
[33:28] excuses we're talking plain we should
[33:31] all come into the sanctuary 30 minutes
[33:34] before and sit down and be respectful as
[33:38] the tape is playing and hearing the
[33:41] prophet I think it's doing a good work
[33:44] amen I think it's bringing the presence
[33:46] of the Lord more into the services than
[33:49] it is to just be running backers and
[33:51] forth now listen I know everybody ain't
[33:54] capable of coming up a lot of time but
[33:57] now don't don't start the excuses well I
[33:59] can't get up Sunday morning might be an
[34:02] excuse cuz you're a teacher you're
[34:04] hailing a class you're doing this that
[34:06] that's that's go that's all but each one
[34:09] of you teachers should say to your
[34:11] children maybe way down to the adults
[34:14] you know boy to the bigger you know hey
[34:17] if you need to go to the bathroom you're
[34:18] excused sure right of course expect all
[34:22] of them to leave you know I mean
[34:26] okay but listen
[34:31] I said I know some of you can't do
[34:33] it all right now we're not complaining
[34:37] we're
[34:38] talking there should be no children come
[34:41] up here to practice music without an
[34:45] adult
[34:48] amen no children come up here to
[34:51] practice without an
[34:54] adult being with
[34:56] you and I know I know listen come on you
[35:00] sitting here and you're having to tell
[35:01] well what song are we praying what are

[35:06] be sincere about it be be quiet you
[35:10] don't have to holler boy that was good
[35:11] one was I'm sitting in the study a lot
[35:15] of times
[35:16] okay all right I try not to run out and
[35:20] say nothing but sometimes I hear things
[35:22] a little bit too
[35:24] loud that's what I'm saying no children
[35:26] to be up here now children don't come up
[35:28] here to play unless you got an
[35:31] adult to come up with you all
[35:34] right
[35:35] see no children doing that unless you're
[35:39] accompanied by an adult and controlled
[35:42] by that
[35:44] adult be sure that all are
[35:47] notified of the parts and the practicing
[35:50] and the singing you know let them be
[35:53] notified because that's the way it needs
[35:55] to be make sure all are instructed in
[35:58] the singing and the thing cuz you need
[36:01] to be somebody needs to be in
[36:04] charge appoint someone come to me I'll
[36:06] appoint one and when I appoint one
[36:09] that's a
[36:10] law uh you want to quote from the
[36:13] prophet the pastor is the only one got a
[36:15] right to put in and take out anyone he
[36:18] wants
[36:19] to now that's you want that
[36:22] quote you say yeah but we don't we're
[36:24] not supporting the denominations we're
[36:27] according to what the prophet says all
[36:33] right now
[36:35] listen make sure all are contacted about
[36:39] your singing groups and your things that

[36:47] contacted tell them in the classes tell
[36:49] them in the what tell them up here we'll
[36:50] announce it we do a lot of times anounce
[36:53] everybody's to meet so make sure
[36:55] everybody knows that and follows that
[36:59] because you're in
[37:00] charge all

[39:02] lot of times with you need to clean up

[39:11] in don't throw down things and let
[39:14] things do you need to clean up where
[39:18] you're
[39:19] sitting it's your children and all and
[39:22] so clean it up to end of the service
[39:26] take a little time and pick up the
[39:27] papers and the things and and all you
[39:30] know I mean that's okay all right now
[39:35] make sure especially
[39:37] downstairs that where you eat at and
[39:40] things that you clean up that
[39:44] area well I didn't see don't start that
[39:47] right if you want to come up here I get
[39:49] here I'm nine nine times out of 10 and
[39:51] I'm a first one here and you know what
[39:53] I'll do most of the time I didn't get to
[39:56] do it today because I was running some
[39:58] things and trying to think a
[40:00] little I go out and look over the
[40:02] parking
[40:04] lot and clean up
[40:09] everything you come out and get out of
[40:11] your car and there's a Coke can or there
[40:14] is there any problem to stop and picking
[40:16] that up and go put it in the dry
[40:20] scan I ain't picking up the trash out
[40:22] there it ain't my job I didn't know we
[40:26] had jobs like
[40:28] that I didn't know we had to have a job
[40:31] as a this I thought it was I helped the
[40:34] janitor as much as I
[40:38] can
[40:40] right we should all be that
[40:43] way there should be no drinks brought
[40:46] into the sanctuary now listen I've been
[40:48] plain I try to be and I know I get in
[40:51] trouble cuz here goes trouble brother
[40:54] dick Addison had problems with his sugar
[40:57] and the things like that I allowed him
[41:00] to bring a drink in I didn't and I'm
[41:03] putting it on here I didn't like the way
[41:04] he cared it in out and open in front of
[41:06] everybody he could have put it in a can
[41:08] and slid it in the seat that's up to him
[41:10] if he hears that and he'll know I don't
[41:12] like it that way see I don't like the
[41:15] point of us doing things to make it look
[41:17] like we're
[41:19] doing if I give you permission to bring
[41:22] a Coke in or a a water you should hide
[41:26] that water in your pocket
[41:28] not hold up brother D told me I could do
[41:33] this
[41:35] yeah no it shouldn't
[41:39] be because in most churches you'd get it
[41:41] straight and blunt
[41:43] right no water drinks period in the
[41:47] sanctuary period period
[41:52] right come on I try to be nice I try to
[41:55] be okay
[41:58] everything should be done decently and
[42:00] in
[42:01] order I believe children that are like
[42:04] six seven years of age they should be
[42:07] sitting up in a Pew listening to the
[42:10] service
[42:12] amen I know children hey I love them and
[42:14] you know that and these children know it
[42:17] they know it from the bottom of my heart
[42:19] that I love them and I want to help them
[42:20] and do and to do anything in the world I
[42:22] could for them but you should
[42:25] be little children should set
[42:29] up and if they get sleepy they're going
[42:31] to lay over and go to sleep that's a
[42:35] kid but don't come with a planning you
[42:38] know what are you going to do today now
[42:40] lay me down to
[42:42] sleep don't PL it
[42:44] don't
[42:46] okay people you know children should
[42:50] be monitored to the point
[42:53] of
[42:54] say get up kids and sit down
[42:57] yes you shouldn't be drawing coloring
[43:02] painting doing things like that in the
[43:06] service if you're over that six seven
[43:09] years of age and control them underneath
[43:12] that you know but you understand what
[43:16] I'm saying I see some bringing in great
[43:19] big bags of things backpacks all like I
[43:22] I don't think we need that in
[43:24] church I mean you know well I'm w c well
[43:27] my kids want well how old are
[43:31] they
[43:33] okay anything shouldn't be brought into
[43:36] the
[43:37] sanctuary that shouldn't be there at all
[43:41] control your children
[43:43] interactions and if necessary you take
[43:46] your children out so that they don't
[43:49] interfere with the
[43:51] services anything wrong with
[43:54] that I ain't saying when you know you in
[43:57] I can pull you and you get brother
[43:58] brandham I'll show you where brother
[44:00] brandham plats he puts it down to the to
[44:03] the point boy I mean he lays it down
[44:06] strong and then right at the end of that
[44:08] service there kids in there crying like
[44:09] everything he ain't saying a thing he's
[44:12] a Doty old granddaddy you think brother
[44:15] brandom was a hard Stern guy no he was
[44:18] honest and
[44:22] sincere he had a heart of love
[44:27] he did not say go back there and run
[44:29] that kid out of the room no we're not
[44:30] saying nothing like that if you think
[44:32] that's what it is you're the one
[44:33] thinking
[44:34] wrong kids are going to be kids just
[44:37] like that one they're going to say
[44:39] things and do things they're going to
[44:41] cry they're going to do you have to take
[44:44] care of them they're kids but now 14
[44:46] years old is
[44:48] enough
[44:50] right I don't mean that to you kids at
[44:52] 14 that just that just number come out
[44:55] okay
[44:58] all right let me get a little bit and
[45:00] then we'll get on to the service today
[45:02] see control your
[45:04] children make them act and Dre right and
[45:08] then
[45:11] don't if somebody one of the deacons or
[45:14] somebody corrects one of your
[45:18] children you get all blowed up and
[45:21] puffed up if you're going to be that way
[45:23] we leave I didn't ask you to come right
[45:28] is that blunt
[45:29] enough I didn't ask you to come here I
[45:33] ain't going to beg you not to leave
[45:35] that's right but I'm going to tell you
[45:36] where we stand that's right and what we
[45:39] stand for if you don't like that then
[45:42] okay that's a situation you have to deal
[45:44] with it I've done everything I've could
[45:46] to try to be nice and help you and do
[45:48] for you spend money on you give you
[45:51] thousands and thousands of dollars and
[45:53] all like that to do this that and the
[45:55] other send the kids to camps do all all
[45:57] kind of things one of some of it I
[45:58] didn't even agree with parts of things
[46:00] myself but yet I've done it to try to be
[46:03] a good pastor to help you to your
[46:05] children to where they can grow
[46:09] up and want to be
[46:14] right all right remember you're in
[46:17] charge of that child that's right right
[46:19] now who was it said it uh let's see I'm
[46:22] going to paraphrase it I guess you know
[46:24] it's your responsibility for your
[46:26] children get to baptism of the Holy
[46:28] Ghost somebody made that statement just
[46:30] recently now I don't remember what it
[46:31] was but you know it's a good
[46:34] statement you know you're responsible to
[46:36] bring them to church you're responsible
[46:39] to to tell them what it is to be a
[46:41] Christian You're expect they're supposed
[46:44] to be looking at you to see what a
[46:46] Christian is supposed to be
[46:47] like you know that all of that should be
[46:51] okay now listen I've noticed this one
[46:53] around here and I just say a word about
[46:54] it okay I've noticed a a lot of your
[46:58] sisters and when I say sisters that goes
[47:01] from Nanny which is 77 I guess the
[47:04] oldest no no sister CET excuse me sister
[47:06] clet look around back
[47:08] there I'm talking to her down to the
[47:11] youngest little child look your high
[47:14] heels is getting a little bit too
[47:17] high yeah the you want to get the profit
[47:21] see that's where that I get in trouble
[47:23] by saying things to people but if I
[47:25] preach what most preachers
[47:27] preach you'd be in bad
[47:30] shape I don't preach on hair and dress
[47:33] and clothes I expect a mom and daddy to
[47:37] take care of their children I preach
[47:40] Christianity I preach being borned again
[47:44] will take care of the cutting the hire
[47:46] and the
[47:47] clothes but then when you start seeing
[47:49] it ease out and gets a little bit and
[47:52] you know come on
[47:55] Church you sisters know what I'm talking
[47:57] about it's true you say well our sisters
[47:59] on yeah there's a lady what's her name
[48:02] that's got hired that just walks along
[48:03] and it drags behind her Crystal Crystal
[48:06] Gale you know I ain't against her that's
[48:08] none of my business I'm just saying you
[48:11] know yourself it's cut straight across
[48:13] yeah so that means she's cutting it what
[48:17] no matter how long it is she's cutting
[48:21] it hey girls don't be deceived don't
[48:24] think well I can sneak and get my high
[48:26] trimmed
[48:27] anybody that knows any sense at all look
[48:29] at you and see it's cut straight across
[48:31] her don't grow straight
[48:34] across he
[48:36] grows different
[48:38] lens okay but see you should be
[48:41] concerned about your high heels your
[48:46] clothes I'll still put our church
[48:48] against anybody in the message I ain't
[48:49] worried about it so I ain't throwing
[48:50] nobody out right am sir I'm proud of you

[49:05] not have to be beat to death about
[49:08] everything it it it irks me to have to
[49:11] say things like I'm saying today because
[49:14] I want you to do what you're supposed to
[49:16] do as a
[49:18] Christian why would you not want to do
[49:22] that moms and dad look at your children
[49:25] what they're wearing
[49:31] yeah but just remember you need to look
[49:34] over at your wife every once in a while
[49:36] and if her knees is shining something's
[49:39] close
[49:45] okay see remember girls but I'm just as
[49:49] bad now listen I'm not against the
[49:50] girls and for the boys come on boys we
[49:54] get the same thing man we're the ones

[52:59] preacher well see they'd be tickled to
[53:01] death for their son to be a preacher I
[53:03] didn't make him a preacher but I sure
[53:04] did pray a lot for him
[53:07] amen amen I'm trying to just be serious
[53:10] about all of us we're supposed to be
[53:13] Christians
[53:16] amen living for the world to look at
[53:19] right amen well that ain't my
[53:22] problem well according to the Bible it
[53:26] is is yes it amen so if I offended you
[53:30] anything I've said today I'm sorry for
[53:32] offending you but I'm not sorry for what
[53:34] I say cuz I'm going to say
[53:37] it and I'm not going to say just me and
[53:40] my me and my my family you to live like
[53:43] my family no you sort to live should
[53:46] live like a
[53:48] Christian you should be a Christian in
[53:51] every actions and ways and thing and
[53:53] maybe your children would like to be
[53:55] about that that
[53:58] way if nothing else they'll highly
[54:00] respect
[54:02] you if you'll just live right and be
[54:05] right amen they might not tell you but
[54:09] they'll highly respect you down the road
[54:11] if you do that because we're all
[54:13] Christians and being
[54:14] Christians all
[54:16] right because that's what we should be
[54:19] amen we should be
[54:22] Christians not to have to
[54:24] be I enjoy
[54:27] it I'm having a I'm having a good time I
[54:31] you
[54:32] know not caral illustration I guess but
[54:36] you know I never had no problem working
[54:38] at General Motors I was making a living
[54:40] amen and I ran jobs that sometimes it'
[54:43] take two people to run them when I
[54:44] wasn't
[54:46] there I worked but I never done it on a
[54:50] basis I done it because they was paying
[54:53] my bills they was giving me money to
[54:56] make a
[54:58] living you know I didn't have to do
[55:01] anything
[55:02] wrong I I was just being what I was
[55:05] being I worked well that's what I think
[55:07] about a Christian and sort of just would
[55:09] just be
[55:13] that and live before them what you'd
[55:16] want them to
[55:17] be now I'll end it by saying this
[55:20] because remember the way you live before
[55:22] them is the way they will be right right
[55:27] that's right did that come out right
[55:29] now you want them to live and be right
[55:33] but remember the way you
[55:34] live is the way they're going to
[55:41] follow so then try to be a
[55:43] Christian try to be a Christian all the
[55:47] time all right
[55:50] okay just try to be a
[55:53] Christian I got just a little thought so
[56:00] let's think about
[56:04] something okay I'm over with that any
[56:06] questions any thoughts anything you want
[56:07] to say against me or for me or whatever
[56:09] just go ahead write notes give them to
[56:11] them and tell me I'll do the best I can
[56:15] cuz that's what I
[56:17] am but I want to ask you questions I
[56:21] love questions amen I do brother R said
[56:24] questions makes a strong church now
[56:28] listen questions without answers don't
[56:31] make a strong
[56:33] church now what's he
[56:36] saying questions with an answer from
[56:41] God is no longer a question it's a
[56:45] statement of fact or a point amen right
[56:50] so then when he says something you know
[56:53] think about what he's saying question
[56:56] makes a strong church cuz it makes us
[56:59] dig in amen I want to ask you a
[57:04] question how many
[57:08] times is it in the
[57:11] Bible where it uses the word Eternal
[57:21] Covenant now I don't ask ask to raise a
[57:24] hand I'm I'm trying to get a point for
[57:26] for the message what I'm talking
[57:28] about
[57:30] H but WR down how many times you think
[57:33] it would be in the
[57:37] Bible now some of you catch real quick
[57:39] on this one so all right I'll I'll let
[57:41] you cheat sheet just a
[57:43] little how many times is in there that's
[57:46] called an Everlasting
[57:49] Covenant what I said see someone already
[57:51] shaking your heads cuz you you got to
[57:53] cheat sheet from way back yeah you you
[57:56] got what you've read and heard okay but
[57:59] it's odd isn't it why
[58:03] would
[58:06] God I believe I'm right now it says
[58:08] Everlasting Covenant I believe it 15
[58:11] times
[58:14] uh it's not in the Bible at all that
[58:17] says Eternal Covenant that's
[58:22] right now eternal life is there amen and
[58:26] all like that that's why I thought of
[58:28] this the other day when I was ending up
[58:31] in the message remember brother Brandon
[58:32] says he says we believe in Eternal
[58:37] Heaven he said we believe in an eternal
[58:40] God or something he had about three
[58:41] things he said but we don't believe in
[58:43] an eternal
[58:45] hell he said we don't believe in that
[58:48] amen he said because anything had a
[58:50] beginning has an ending so we don't
[58:52] believe in eternal hell we've been
[58:54] taught that all of our life and thought
[58:55] the said but the Bible in no way ever
[58:57] teaches hell as to be an eternal because
[59:01] hell had a beginning it was created the
[59:03] Bible said for the devil and his angels
[59:05] it will be burned up one day in the Lake
[59:07] of Fire
[59:09] amen all right so then there's no such
[59:14] thing as an eternal hell but yet there's
[59:16] an eternal
[59:18] life there's an eternal
[59:22] heaven but yet that'll be destroyed one
[59:24] day so then how you going to explain now
[59:27] I'm just asking you simple
[59:29] questions something that maybe means
[59:32] nothing to you but it rings a bell with
[59:35] me and it just think oh but
[59:41] why why would it not be 5,000 times that
[59:47] it would say an eternal Covenant
[59:56] why would it
[59:57] say an Everlasting Covenant
[1:00:02] yeah more times than to say an eternal
[1:00:08] Covenant see that's what makes the joy
[1:00:10] in my heart is to think of these
[1:00:13] things and they come out and then you
[1:00:15] you you you pray and you seek
[1:00:20] God how many of you remembers the quote
[1:00:22] that I gave the other day
[1:00:28] where brother brandom said on things
[1:00:29] that are to be said I got the baptism
[1:00:32] with the Holy Ghost that still has
[1:00:35] nothing to do with
[1:00:36] it that's just only a temporal gift
[1:00:41] right amen for
[1:00:45] you no that's what he
[1:00:48] said it's a temporal
[1:00:51] gift why would brother random call S an
[1:00:54] eternal point of eternal life and the
[1:00:56] thing but to talk about a baptism of the
[1:00:58] Holy Ghost that we all said this is
[1:01:00] where we get born again we get this we
[1:01:02] get that we get all the things we you
[1:01:03] know and the prophet say it's a temporal
[1:01:10] gift a temporary
[1:01:16] gift now according to my sense and
[1:01:18] knowledge I thought the word temporary
[1:01:20] meant something that wasn't Eternal you
[1:01:22] know that
[1:01:24] had it's there's something wrong with it
[1:01:27] why would your Prophet call it a
[1:01:30] temporal
[1:01:37] gift why would the Bible speak of an
[1:01:41] Everlasting
[1:01:44] Covenant 15 times and never speak of an
[1:01:48] eternal Covenant
[1:01:59] but yet we're in the
[1:02:04] message but see if you read you get an
[1:02:10] answer so you know real certain you know
[1:02:13] I don't fool around with all this
[1:02:14] garbage can that's running out now
[1:02:16] saying brother Brown was
[1:02:18] wrong I say it pling language if some of
[1:02:21] them dummies will come and even halfway
[1:02:23] come up to what the prophet taught I
[1:02:26] don't know where I even want to listen
[1:02:27] to him or not then but I'd at least
[1:02:29] think more about him if they come up
[1:02:31] with some kind of a sensible answer to a
[1:02:33] lot of
[1:02:41] things do you have eternal life yes you
[1:02:44] can have eternal
[1:02:47] life but you don't have an eternal
[1:02:54] Covenant wow
[1:03:01] well you say oh that's just the Old
[1:03:05] Testament cuz it starts out in Genesis
[1:03:08] about the uh uh the first time is when
[1:03:12] Noah and the rainbow and he said I give
[1:03:14] you an Everlasting
[1:03:18] Covenant comes on over a little bit to
[1:03:21] Abraham and and changing him from Abram
[1:03:24] to Abraham and he said I'll give you an
[1:03:26] Everlasting
[1:03:28] Covenant it comes on over further into
[1:03:30] the Old Testament of dealing with Israel
[1:03:32] as a nation and he said I'll give you an
[1:03:35] Everlasting Covenant about the land and
[1:03:37] the
[1:03:44] things but then you jump over to where
[1:03:46] we read or we hav read it so better read
[1:03:49] it You' be thinking I'm reading wrong go
[1:03:52] ahead brother Hebrews 13
[1:04:04] look what Paul has to say now this is
[1:04:05] New Testament okay obey them that have
[1:04:08] the rule over you and submit yourselves
[1:04:11] for they watch for your souls as they
[1:04:13] that must give an account that they may
[1:04:16] do it with joy not with grief for it is
[1:04:18] unprofitable for for it is unprofitable
[1:04:21] for you now remember
[1:04:26] they've watched out your souls that's
[1:04:28] right amen so now something down here is
[1:04:30] going to pop out in a minute and you're
[1:04:32] going to see what it
[1:04:34] means go ahead pray for us we trust you
[1:04:37] have a good conscience and all things
[1:04:39] willing to live honestly but I beseech
[1:04:42] you rather to do that that I may be
[1:04:45] restored to you the sooner now the God
[1:04:47] of Peace that brought again from the
[1:04:50] dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd
[1:04:54] of the Sheep
[1:04:56] through the blood of the
[1:04:59] Everlasting
[1:05:05] Covenant I said we could follow it
[1:05:07] through the Old Testament and look at it
[1:05:08] and talk about an Everlasting Covenant
[1:05:11] because we' know that you did not have
[1:05:12] eternal life in your soul that's right
[1:05:15] you did not have eternal life in your
[1:05:16] body or spirit in the Old Testament am
[1:05:19] right so then in knowing that we know
[1:05:21] for certainty that it's an everlasting
[1:05:25] right it's not Eternal eternal life was
[1:05:28] not a product of the Old
[1:05:32] Testament maybe a wrong way of saying
[1:05:34] that but the New Testament has the
[1:05:36] eternal life that it speaks of that it
[1:05:39] speaks of a new
[1:05:43] testament you had an Old Testament that
[1:05:45] would not deal with eternal life but
[1:05:47] would deal with things that would be
[1:05:49] Everlasting uh a rainbow and all but
[1:05:52] remember the rainbow is to be forever
[1:05:55] remember the things you do read in
[1:05:56] Israel and be careful because a lot of
[1:05:58] that has a point to it that it will be
[1:06:02] forever see that children of Israel in
[1:06:06] their land right now that's in their
[1:06:08] land it's theirs it was given to them
[1:06:11] that's right there's an Everlasting
[1:06:12] Covenant with those people for that land
[1:06:15] all right so they'll never lose it I
[1:06:19] don't care what the enemy does or what
[1:06:20] they try to do Israel will never lose
[1:06:22] that because it's Everlasting but
[1:06:25] remember the land is not Eternal
[1:06:27] remember the people are not Eternal amen
[1:06:30] all
[1:06:32] right but why would it be that way that
[1:06:35] Paul would speak of
[1:06:38] a Everlasting
[1:06:44] Covenant why would he not call it
[1:06:47] Eternal why would he not deal with those
[1:06:49] things
[1:06:57] go ahead and pull up number five
[1:06:59] brothers and we'll get that and then
[1:07:00] we'll we'll take just a minute we'll
[1:07:03] close
[1:07:04] out try to give you something where you
[1:07:06] won't go home down and out about it so
[1:07:08] all we done got chewed out this
[1:07:11] morning he hurt my
[1:07:14] feelings well after the service is over
[1:07:17] with I'll rub you
[1:07:19] back not to women but I let my wife do
[1:07:24] that
[1:07:25] but
[1:07:26] listen why would it be get the
[1:07:30] situation why would it be you can follow
[1:07:33] as I said you can follow the Everlasting
[1:07:35] Covenant through the Old Testament right
[1:07:38] because there's not eternal life there
[1:07:40] so you can see it's Everlasting now when
[1:07:43] you get to the New Testament with a New
[1:07:45] Covenant and the new things why would
[1:07:47] Paul call it an Everlasting Covenant
[1:07:50] right why would he not call it an
[1:07:52] eternal Covenant right
[1:07:58] see one of these days you're going to
[1:07:59] realize why I keep hollering and
[1:08:00] screaming the new birth is the birth of
[1:08:04] the
[1:08:05] word it is that word that you take all
[1:08:08] of that I put on the the anointing was
[1:08:10] what justification chops off your pie
[1:08:13] sin sanctification cleans and sets aside
[1:08:15] the Garment but remember at
[1:08:18] sanctification the word being brought
[1:08:20] into your soul is what drives out the
[1:08:22] devil the unclean Spirit but it all also
[1:08:26] plants that word within there to where
[1:08:29] that when the Holy Ghost does come it
[1:08:31] can make you
[1:08:33] alive amen right but remember it only
[1:08:37] makes your soul
[1:08:39] alive it doesn't make your body alive
[1:08:42] doesn't make your spirit
[1:08:44] alive it makes your soul
[1:08:49] alive all right now look what your
[1:08:52] Prophet had to
[1:08:54] say list some close now taken from the
[1:08:56] message token
[1:08:59] 1963 do you recognize his son is saved
[1:09:01] in Egypt the things of blood the blood
[1:09:03] lamb is the type of Jesus Christ in
[1:09:05] Hebrews 13:10 and 20 I ain't got time to
[1:09:09] read it put it down I was going to read
[1:09:11] it it's called the Everlasting
[1:09:14] Covenant the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:09:17] called the Everlasting
[1:09:21] Covenant yes sir Everlasting why is it
[1:09:24] not called eternal
[1:09:26] Covenant
[1:09:28] right you said well it's interchangeable
[1:09:31] between Everlasting and eternal go ahead
[1:09:34] you just running yourself blind let's
[1:09:36] read what the prophet
[1:09:39] says then we know what it's meant by
[1:09:42] then we know why in the Old Testament it
[1:09:44] could be an Everlasting Covenant right
[1:09:46] cuz in none of it was eternal amen a
[1:09:49] prophecy coming forth of the children of
[1:09:52] Israel where it says one time that he
[1:09:53] would give them an everlasting in
[1:09:55] Covenant which would be the prophecy
[1:09:57] that God would come and live in you
[1:09:59] right going to Jeremiah and Isaiah and
[1:10:02] things just really in Everlasting
[1:10:04] Covenant when you and and see what I'm
[1:10:06] talking about but
[1:10:08] look why wasn't it called Eternal
[1:10:16] Covenant because that it wouldn't be
[1:10:19] eternal
[1:10:25] that's right my brother
[1:10:28] Brandon amen because that it wouldn't be
[1:10:35] Eternal now look at his
[1:10:37] answer when we're redeemed it's all over
[1:10:41] then that's
[1:10:43] right now watch our Point
[1:10:47] listen when you come into the New
[1:10:49] Testament was you following me from the
[1:10:51] Old Testament you had the Everlasting
[1:10:53] Covenant nothing Eternal but when you
[1:10:55] you come into the New Testament you had
[1:10:56] a new testament which was speaking of
[1:10:59] eternal life in the soul of the
[1:11:01] individual by that new birth all right
[1:11:05] but that never made the body and the
[1:11:07] spirit
[1:11:09] Eternal that's
[1:11:11] right right so that's what we're waiting
[1:11:14] on is eternal life for this body and
[1:11:18] spirit and while we're waiting we're in
[1:11:20] an Everlasting Covenant because it's not
[1:11:23] Eternal because we're not fully redeemed
[1:11:25] that's right looken it's an everlasting
[1:11:28] which means certain amount of time till
[1:11:30] time is out there'll never be another
[1:11:32] one when time runs out we won't need no
[1:11:35] Covenant that's right amen that's right
[1:11:37] are you listening but until time runs
[1:11:40] out we need the
[1:11:41] Covenant are you with
[1:11:44] me
[1:11:47] amen you don't have an eternal
[1:11:53] Covenant sure you have eternal Life by
[1:11:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that
[1:11:58] doesn't redeem the body and the spirit
[1:12:01] it has to wait but when Redemption is
[1:12:04] over you don't need a covenant amen
[1:12:08] that's
[1:12:08] right are you reading
[1:12:11] iten no Covenant amen once it's over
[1:12:16] once you're fully redeemed once your
[1:12:18] body spirit and soul which is in the
[1:12:19] resurrection and
[1:12:21] Rapture and chain and Ascension amen yes
[1:12:27] now brother Run's right a't
[1:12:32] he because
[1:12:34] that baptism of the Holy
[1:12:38] Ghost it don't make your soul your body
[1:12:41] Eternal it don't make your spirit
[1:12:45] Eternal it's temporal that's right or
[1:12:48] temporary right it seals the
[1:12:52] soul come on that's right you have
[1:12:55] eternal life in your
[1:12:58] soul but your body is not Eternal your
[1:13:01] spirit is not
[1:13:03] Eternal but once you're
[1:13:08] redeemed once you're redeemed see you no
[1:13:11] longer need a
[1:13:13] covenant once you're redeemed you don't
[1:13:15] need eternal life why cuz you already
[1:13:17] have
[1:13:19] it right amen you already have it so
[1:13:24] what is it
[1:13:28] forgive me need no I'm too far gone
[1:13:31] finishing up come on musicians just
[1:13:34] think on these
[1:13:38] things think about whatever was ask in
[1:13:40] the
[1:13:41] question it never says Eternal Covenant
[1:13:44] no right why because it was never meant
[1:13:47] to be an eternal
[1:13:49] Covenant it was meant to be a covenant
[1:13:52] for time amen amen
[1:13:56] amen it was meant to be exactly what it
[1:13:59] turned out to be a new testament but
[1:14:02] that New Testament is in his blood but
[1:14:04] that new testament only gives you
[1:14:06] eternal life in your
[1:14:08] soul that's right it doesn't make your
[1:14:11] body and spirit
[1:14:16] Eternal what about a wonderful point to
[1:14:18] look back in the Old Testament and say
[1:14:20] they spoke of it but they couldn't bring
[1:14:23] it
[1:14:24] amen and even the Bible coming into
[1:14:26] Jesus Christ and the new birth it could
[1:14:29] bring eternal life to the soul right but
[1:14:33] it didn't bring eternal life to the
[1:14:36] body nor the
[1:14:38] spirit we're still waiting on that
[1:14:42] am no
[1:14:44] wonder I'm
[1:14:46] redeemed by love
[1:14:49] divine glory
[1:14:51] glory amen when my Redemption is over
[1:14:55] I don't have to have nothing CU I
[1:14:58] already have
[1:15:01] it when my body and spirit goes into
[1:15:05] that change and makes it Eternal I'm
[1:15:08] Eternal in Body Soul and
[1:15:10] Spirit I don't need a covenant a
[1:15:14] covenant is for the point of where
[1:15:16] you're needing it to keep you from being
[1:15:18] condemned and destroyed amen right
[1:15:23] amen so we have an Everlasting Covenant
[1:15:28] what eternal life through Jesus Christ
[1:15:30] Our Lord
[1:15:34] amen puts us to a
[1:15:37] place that's why church I don't
[1:15:39] understand why people don't want to hear
[1:15:41] the you realize under sanctification God
[1:15:45] cleansed and claimed that body you're
[1:15:46] living in amen you don't never even
[1:15:48] think about that that's in future home
[1:15:52] he cleansed and claimed that body you're
[1:15:54] living in and one day he'll take
[1:15:56] possession of it one day it will be
[1:15:59] fully redeemed and when it's
[1:16:02] redeemed I don't have to have eternal
[1:16:05] life because I am eternal life it dwells
[1:16:10] within me that day it'll dwell in my
[1:16:12] body and my spirit to make it Eternal I
[1:16:15] don't have to have something over there
[1:16:17] to say oh I'm glad I've got that I've
[1:16:19] got a tree of life no no uh-uh right
[1:16:22] here is where it's at
[1:16:26] yes it's just the way that it's stated
[1:16:29] but maybe you'd never thought about it
[1:16:31] go home and look it up it doesn't say
[1:16:34] Eternal Covenant amen that's right
[1:16:37] because see if it did then you'd be in
[1:16:41] trouble you'd only oh maybe that's why
[1:16:43] the good old Baptist wants to they don't
[1:16:46] want to redeem his body the good old
[1:16:48] Baptist in this
[1:16:49] message cuz you'd be surprised how many
[1:16:52] people in this message say they going to
[1:16:54] get a new
[1:16:55] body maybe you believe that maybe some
[1:16:58] of you new and's coming in heard that
[1:16:59] way back you going get you a new body
[1:17:04] why I want this body
[1:17:09] redeemed without but one statement when
[1:17:11] Jesus raised he raised with nail prints
[1:17:14] in his hands glorified Eternal Body with
[1:17:17] nail prints he'll always have
[1:17:22] that that will never be annihilated
[1:17:24] he'll always have those nail
[1:17:27] prints that's right but what about when
[1:17:29] we become just as Eternal as he is Body
[1:17:32] Spirit and soul we already are in Soul
[1:17:35] am yes we're already in a new
[1:17:38] testament that's right under a New
[1:17:41] Covenant yes right but it can only be
[1:17:45] called Everlasting at this period of
[1:17:47] time that's right because it's not
[1:17:50] finished Oh Glory how much this message
[1:17:54] could bring to us if we just listen to
[1:17:56] it right how much it could be if we
[1:17:59] would just read the message and not get
[1:18:00] our own ideas and thoughts involved in
[1:18:03] it when I just don't understand how you
[1:18:05] can be Everlasting and eternal what are
[1:18:07] you trying to say brother Dale exactly
[1:18:10] what your Prophet said
[1:18:13] yes that we don't have an eternal
[1:18:16] Covenant cuz it's not finished
[1:18:19] yet so we have an Everlasting Covenant
[1:18:22] for time to take care of the space and
[1:18:24] the point that we areen but one day
[1:18:27] we'll have a glorified body like unto
[1:18:29] his glorious body then everything will
[1:18:31] be Eternal let's stand together what we
[1:18:35] got done better than I
[1:18:39] [Music]
[1:18:48] thought I
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:51] long to be like it
[1:18:54] [Music]
