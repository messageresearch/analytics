holy holy holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you good to be a this good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Hebrews 11 we will finally get down to speaking about faith the way we started out to do and trying to get to so just you know we're going to be on this for quite a little bit now and there'll probably be a lot of repeating uh because I want you to uh be able to understand what I'm talking about whether you believe it or not I want it to be you know uh for you to understand the way that I'm trying to bring it all right uh the Lord willing next weekend brother Tom ERM is not going to be able to come so he's not going to be here with us preaching any and brother uh William um sister Monica's brother will be here preaching for us now we don't know where both services or just one whatever we go from there but brother Tom Earnest and him's not coming you had to make a different Arrangements also now we had announced that we're going to have the uh 4th of July weekend a fish fry and we had announced that we were going to have it on Saturday and then regular services on Sunday and so some have wound up to be that they're going to be some kids gone to Camp Josiah and and little Zach and the family will be gone to Hall them and everything so we will be changing it to where that we'll be having a regular uh Bible study Saturday night all right everybody got it regular Bible study Saturday night on the 5th of July and then on the 6th of July we will be having a fish fry here we'll just have one service and then we'll have a fish fry afterward in the evening so that's changing the things around and make sure you get that now what we're announcing and tell everybody about it all right amen everybody got the scripture Hebrews 11 any other announcements I generally miss something I know that we uh appreciate God being with with uh BB and the baby and everything's fine so that's all right and made us a another great grandma and a great grandpa so we're getting them on up there now getting a crowd of them that's where it goes with the age and then our brother dick and sister Gail coming up to you say 59 years and their an iversary today and we say to you happy anniversary so what anyone else anything else that we've missed all right Heavenly Father we thank you for all things we thank you that you are God and you change not and then that way we can depend on you we know we don't have to worry about it we don't have to be concerned about changes along the way we don't have to be concerned about having to find the changes or walk in but you've always been Hebrews 13:8 that's where Eve messed up in the garden by not believing that and that is the great test to be put forth before the people here in the end time is to see whether we believe you to be the same so we pray that you would just help us open our understanding forgive our sins bless us in Your Love in Your Grace and just have your way with us tonight in Jesus name thank you Lord amen Hebrews 11 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it Elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which were which are seen were not made of things which do appear you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to try to get into this scripture and maybe on it for uh quite a bit on to the point because I want to drive this down hard for us to see it and and understand it but you remember now what we've been talking about a positive attitude to where that that we can can uh be positive about what we're saying and not negative CU negativism will get us nowhere but you know uh negativism is what causes most of your sicknesses because that way you you start going over on and getting into the wrong side and and the right mental attitude the prophet said toward any promise of God would bring that promise to pass all right so then we need to have the even just if nothing else we need to have the right mental attitude and the right mental attitude shouldn't be in this day and hour as I've emphasized over a couple of services it shouldn't be oh wowy wowy woo as brother for is always saying you know oh we're Downing out because of the problems and nobody's got troubles like I've got well we found out that nothing can't come upon you unless God permits it so wowy wowy yo woo you know are we trying to get away from the will of God for our lives or the thing that would bring us to uh the bases that God can come on the scene because we found out that you know God comes on the scene in the the oddest ways isn't right in all of our troubles heartaches and trials when we think we're all alone and nobody loves us that's when God is more on the scene CU he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you you remember the story about the the man wondering about the the two sets of footprints and then when it got down to the hard part you know there was just one set and uh he said Lord I don't understand it he said that's when I was having to carry you well we ought to be able to get down to the bases at least to have the right mental attitude remember what we found out too that God loves to test us and not tempt us he didn't tempt job he tested job he permitted the devil to bring upon job the things that was brought so as to to bring him to a test but he never made those things come as to tempt him remember what we tried to bring out Satan tempts God tests a lot of difference in the two yet you can think about the wording of it and it sounds like the same and it's all seemingly trouble but I was just thinking and trying to put down a few things on it you know Satan puts before us things to tempt us God doesn't put anything before you to tempt you now that that that would be the wrong thing he permits trials and troubles to come our way to test but not putting them there that they've got to be because if we would be right about it we could bypass a lot of our sicknesses and things if we uh didn't fail all the test you know and and if we fail them remember we got to go back to them again because that's the one way all right see God really tests Us by his word Satan tempts us with the world and life and doings and you know riches and and all kind of thing he tempts with those things but God tests us or tries Us by his word to see if we'll take the word and just stand on it right all and see that way he can mold a character into you and I you know and and bring us to the right place now remember it was at the end or the final test of Abraham that he was went up to offer his own son and then God really came on the scene job got as far as he could go God came on the S see my point has been one thing don't think that God is not with us or where's the Lord and and what have I done wrong listen I know I'm just too old too blunt too plain but nobody don't have to tell you when you do wrong if you're so dumb that you don't know when you do wrong then your dumbness is a problem that's a big wrong and brother R said you don't have to tell nobody that's wrong to commit adultery that's right but see that's what everybody in the message think we come in this great message and it's don't tear down the fence don't do this and don't do that we're to know them as human beings but you see then what did we end up by saying God allows these things to happen even permitted there in the Bible said if a if a prophet or a dreamer of dreams come and give you a sign and it come to pass but if he takes you after another God don't hear him now what's another God it's a it's a Doctrine or idea or concept which is contrary to the one true and living God that's right right is any thought or idea that we have that we could be something great because of who we are that's another God see it's not trying to find you it's not that that there's going to the devil can't come along in the end time and try to get you to go after a trinity no so it has to go with other ways and that becomes Our God so so then we we don't but yet what did we find out that God does that to prove to Satan you remember God of this evil age I believe it was that this bride would not fall and remember the fall of Eve in the garden the climax was bad but the start was just a not believing God would keep his word right Hebrews 13:8 but just remember testing brings God to you and I after the test well we got to go through the test but do you understand as I wrote down cuz he said I'll not leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you always it doesn't say always because that CES to wrong all it means wherever we need it he's there all right now as we start out on this point that we're talking about now to to move on over into the message a little bit I've asked this question a good many times is our faith mental Faith or is it substance faith and remember with mental Faith a cheap magician can break life move objects around people can walk on colds of fire and not be burned by mental Faith so don't think we're talking about something that is just so far till one goes one way and one the other remember Eve was deceived with Hebrews 13:8 that's very close all right and I asked a question over and over to you have you ever had God to show you something show you that you were healed amen show you something that was going to happen now I don't mean presumption that's what I'm we'll try to get at tonight what it is cuz see you can have presumptuous thoughts you know and hit pretty good with them MH you know you remember how that that they do it done in the Pentecostal Parts you know and the prophet would speak of it you know and they'd say well there's somebody in the building here tonight got a headache well no more than here tonight there's somebody's head bothered them and then if they say well nobody well it must be mine see those are great Revelation great uh you know anointing great discernment and you'll see what I mean by discernment later on but just remember now that we all start out with mental faith we think we start with some super duper something now Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word there was nobody in the Bible ever saved or healed just by a mental conception just believing it you know I believe it there's an upper room saying I believe it I believe it but they didn't get it until the time came right so then remember what we're talking about Moses was his great intellectual ability he had trained all of his life cuz his mother told him you know as she raised him that he was not the son of Pharaoh's daughter he was the deliverer of her you know and said Son you need to know everything so he trained and he trained and he studied and he he even taught the Egyptians as the Bible says but when he come to the trial and the test he got one dead Egyptian and run into the Wilderness but when he had an experience of the burning bush and he was out there 40 years thinking over well I thought I was a deliverer I believed I was a deliverer I tried to deliver looked like Mama messed up but see couldn't go on what mama said but when he had a personal experience at the burning bush then he was ready to go to Egypt because he had something real not an imagination out in the desert there he probably had a lot of imaginations you know they say you can look out there A lot of times and and just see water you see water you go running for it and it's not there right why because it's your imagination but yet to you it looks real like I always say an old drunk he sees pink elephants and things to him is real but to you is not but that's just a part of his imagination so don't get to point now that we're talking about just mental faith is just well it's so far over that way until brother Dale I know I don't have mental Faith remember mental faith in Christianity Realms now all right is based upon the word of God mental faith is based upon on God's word and mental faith comes by what hearing the word of God all right now in that part then when we talk about perfect Faith the prophet said on Blasphemous names you don't have to run up one or just wait we'll run up number two and start but we've been through this one Blasphemous names the biggest portion of our faith is mental Faith mental faith comes by hearing the word of God right spiritual faith comes by taking the word of God holding on to that word of God and believing that word of God is for you and God can make it alive amen then it can become a spiritual Revelation all right so no matter who we are a great super duper we think we are we all start at the same place we start by hearing the word of God some people didn't have the ability to believe whereas others will never believe because we're asked to believe the impossible amen right as far as what science says man says the world says when you say you're believing in God I'm not talking about whether your Trinity or Force or Oneness or tenness or whatever when you're saying that you're believing in God you're stepping out on the grounds Beyond human mankind because mankind is believing on only what can be proven as to be what is real so you're asked to believe something that in a way you can't prove it but then after it comes to that you can see that it's the one thing that is proven but it takes experience to come through that all right so no matter who we are no matter what it must start by mental faith and then let the hold that word you remember how the disciples wound up being saved they took the word the Bible said and held it that's why there was only 120 in the upper room and not 100,000 that maybe hurt him in his life or 10,000 that hurt him it was the ones who took the word and believed it and held on what about you and I it's those who were were not taken away by the cares of Life the things that The Parables the Lord Jesus spoke of but they took it and held on to it they said one day said where can we go thou has the words of eternal life they' at least come to a position that they knew of no other place to go all right I I think you and I ought at least be that far amen because you take what you got and try to walk across the street over here now you go over there and keep your mouth shut you're all right you're brother that's right but you go over there to open your mouth and you're out the door and I'm not throwing off on nobody that's the their doctor their ideas right you get my point where do we have any place to go oh those people try it they go back and they do this and they do that you know but we at least be far enough along now to realize hey there's not anything else for you and I amen so let's move on right now remember this point and it would be good to even write it down mental faith is not a substance Faith mental faith is an imagination it's a hope it's a wish it's a desire right but it's not a substance all right like we said Peter he was doing fine right he was walking on water but then he lost his substance still has confession about Jesus being God and the Savior and but he lost his substance remember Moses he never had the substance he had a mental concept but when he met the burning bush and brought something personal to him now how many times have I said this so far I keep illustrating it probably Martin Luther in his desires was to try to and he is all writings about it what he's WR he didn't want to leave the Catholic Church he wanted to reform the Church that was why it was called a Reformation he was trying there were a lot of people in those days trying to reform the Church you know move it back to the word the middle and and and coming back to God with it and and he probably done a lot of speaking about the just shall live by faith but one day the message of that hour became a reality to him and when it did he like Moses at the Burning Bush was ready to challenge the world upon what he believed all right right cuz he had something real on we'll get to it in a little bit he had a substance that before then he had a confession an imagination a desire but only when that become a substance in the man's life now how many times have we went over it see Wesley what about him they came a day when he saw what was needed he came to America to be converted I mean the Cur convert to Heathen and got converted right the moravians or how you pronounce it they introduced him to the message of sanctification but they never conquered the world so their message are you listening was not the message of that age even though they were talking about sanctification even though they were talking about doings and deliverances are you listening but when John Wesley saw that message it was the message of that age zusa Street Pentecost people had spoken tongues and different things down through time the gifts had been in operation in her degrees but one day there was an age happened they needed a messenger and that messenger went out speaking of the speaking in tongues see all we do is we argue about well they just done this and they done that even some of the brothers that used to come to church here with us they were back in the Pentecostal mood said there was some of them preachers would tell them people just because you spoke in tongues don't mean you got it cuz they believed in speaking in tongues yeah but they believed in a change in life you go out and live like the devil speak in tongues all you want to that doesn't mean you're a Christian you understand what I'm getting at well we are supposed to be in the end time that this Prophet came to bring us the message of the entire Bible brought his message has passed on left it with us and as I tell my wife the other day we have spent most of the time most people spend the time reading and listening to brother brandom to try to find out him talking about himself when he was talking about a bride he was talking about a church that was where I gave the quotes right the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily h where the bride would be the son of man the bride would be the same grain it went into the ground that would come back well then when are we going to stand up and say this is that see we're going to have to have an experience to match the age that we're living in not a going to church and being good or claiming a message a prophet brought and I've told you over and over they didn't care when Martin Luther protested the Catholic church but when the people begin to become one with his message they got upset all right the prophet brought his message it died down right come on it went around now people are trying to raise up to believe that message is speaking about them and now it's when Satan is going to get upset because it's always been that way all right now I'm talking about a people that brother brandham said quoting it he said that it was no problem in the days of Luther that he could protest the Catholic church he said but to hold his head above all the fanaticism that followed the message that was the greatest of all that was more sure that he was the messenger of God is when the people had the same experience when we have the same experience as individuals and a group of people put together to be the Bride of Jesus Christ that the prophet has brought unto us then we can talk about something real right all right we can stand upon what we believe then that's it it won't be like we talking about brother Bob was talking about there the other Wednesday you know didn't want nobody to know that the preacher said you know God talking about they want nobody to know what he believed I want everybody to know what I believe I would love to be able to stand as Martin Luther did that day and maybe we'll get a change when they asked him said did you write this what was his answer he didn't know what was in the pile right he said but what I wrote I believe it all right all the garbage that goes with this message I don't believe but what's revealed in my heart I believe amen and I'm willing to stand upon believing that you know and no matter what it cost us why can't we be but now mental faith is not a substance it's an imagination which is something that you you think are uh you know you think it's a substance but it's just an imagination a hope is a desire of fulfillment see you think you have it there's where the problem's at but we read in Hebrews one that it says faith is the substance of things you're hoping for expecting Desiring or imaginations that brought to your uh part of your being that you're Desiring after something it's the evidence of Things Not Seen now this is this is a hard point because of trying to break down a little line right here for you to understand and I don't mean that you don't I'm just mean it's a hard thing for all of us to understand it's hard thing for me to understand to separate between uh what we've been taught what we've thought was right to bring it down to a uh a concept at least that we can be scriptural about it and then let God Quicken that to us all right you know how that I've always said it that firew Walker that firew Walker he enters into an imaginary situation and he walks on the co right that preacher who has the great ability to uh even bring healing to people but you put this message in front of it and let him begin to see what this message really is and they'll lose every bit of those great super duper things that they thought they had you know what if you lose it then it evidently would no good right it evidently had no substance to it now I've looked up substance to try to to bring bring it you know backwards and forth and the word substance is used in about three different ways or four that I've finding throughout the scriptures and substance can be referring to just uh structural ability you know houses cars uh wood trees animals uh those things is dealing with a substance you know this pullit all right this is a substance it came off of a tree you know an old tree and it's a substance it's hard all right but now when you're dealing with substance faith in the Bible terminologies and I'm trying to break this down down now so listening when you're talking about scriptural or spiritual faith our substance faith that we just went through that mental faith is not a substance Faith uh Peter had substance Faith but he lost his substance went back to his mental part all right now so there's a difference between mental faith and substance Faith substance faith has something behind it you know and really in relationship to it this is wood this is a substance but according to what we read there in the scripture that it says it's the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen all right which means whatever this tree that this wood was cut out of at one time was in non-existence according to our terminologies of substance right run it all the way back you back to an acorn right come on and the acorn was put in the ground and it come forth and made a tree of substance but when we're talking about Bible terminology of substance remember it's where the acorn came from are you listening that Acorn came from somewhere and it came from an unseen situation as far as our ways of thinking all right but we understand that through faith the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which we are seeing were not made of things which do appear so when we're talking about substance faith we will be going back further than the mental mind of mankind all right because see we give the definition of substance and as we do as I said now substance what anything consist of but remember there was a time this wood was not in existence right there was a time it was an acorn then there was a time that it wasn't no Acorn that's right then there was a time there was no tree or the acorn that's right right there was a time that there wasn't nothing right and God said let there be that's all right now when he said let there be that's the word of God Amen so we're going to find out that the only substance we can depend on is the word of God Amen I hope you'll write that down and take it with you I prayed of how to try to express this part because you just say faith is a substance substance what anything consist of you it just goes right through but remember if there is a substance of anything that substance at one time never existed in the form that we call a substance you keep on going on back back back tree tree tree tree tree until amen you would wind back in the garden and there'd be a tree right but then you keep on backing up until it would be no tree that's right and there'd be no atoms no molecules no scientific abilities and you will go back into the world of what we call the unknown the reason we call it the unknown because we don't know about it but yet the Bible tells us right that it was made from things that do not appear come on now remember if anything ever came into a substance somewhere that started as a word of God all right he didn't have from some other civilization to take a tree and bring it on the earth and plant it you know he didn't have no 99.9% gerti seed you know that's the best you can buy you can't buy 100% gerti seed whether you know that or not go try it you only get about 96 or something like that but yet the word of God said let there be all right now there is the connecting of what we want to hang to is that word is the substance now come on and if that word is a substance then you got to back up past the substance because it says faith is the substance meaning that one time it was not in existence of the way we think because then it would have been the thoughts of God in his mind there's where faith is going to lie cuz come on we're going to get down to where we run to where the Prophet said if you got to a quarter you got the loaf of bread well you can run that and run that and run that you better keep running it because one time he said it like this he says now the quarter is only the purchaseing power the quarter is not the bread it is only the purchasing power that must all be brought together correctly or we'll miss the point of what really is saying in Hebrews all right but are you following me now now Faith is the substance of things hope for all right so you going backward and you find the first substance that we can deal with as understanding because it's hard to deal I know in the human mind as to God and how really is I understand that understand most people can't go back and talk to you about before the world and believing that God existed and walked around and and everything cuz they want to believe a spirit and I want to get into but remember now before it can be a word it's got to be a thought all right so now before he said let there be an oak tree a world a substance Etc tangibility or whatever you want to call them whatever brought this wood into being was already there there's your substance and remember it comes from the mind of God which is the faith faith moved over into a being of Let There Be are you following me faith God God himself alone Elohim self-existing whatever you want to call it but he had thoughts and in his thoughts was the whole concept of trees houses cars this that the other people but none of it was into substance are you with me right but then one day he said Let There Be Right the word amen Prophet said not another God not another he said it's a part of God but said not like a arm flying off of this see it was the word he said let there be now you see a substance what a world right let there be this let there be that let there be this let there be people it all wound up to be substances but before it was substance it was Faith the reason it's saying faith is the substance remember that's present tense is faith is the substance CU whatever created this world is still here believe he didn't go nowhere he's still here all right and in being that he could become a substance right right condescending all right see not talking about a desire of fulfillment he never had a he now don't get me wrong don't okay I don't have the education just forgive me I just try to preach God desired these things into come into being but his desire these can't bring these things come into being didn't bring it into being at that time in his mind was reality to him but in his mind was not the substance we deal with but it's what brought this substance all right what is a substance we can talk about faith let's deal on this substance part and then we'll go back to faith and I hope you follow what I mean by that and you'll see that the faith is the part of God that is his thoughts and he delivers his thoughts to you right and then when he delivers it to you it can become a substance Jesus you don't have to have the tree see that's what we think oh yeah yeah Lord Heal Me Lord Heal Me I'll Go tell everybody about it but if I go tell them I'm Healed and I'm still sick I'm a liar and I don't want to lie you don't want me to lie to you brother Dale you born one you got all the makings of it why tell one more is there any problem if you lied all your life I got a buddy of mine up used to work with he lied he lied so much he believed his own lies well would one more lie hurt him now you know I'm not talking about we got a lie you know what I'm talking about you're a liar when you won't say you're healed that's right that's according to the Bible right sir let the sick say so amen what that they're healed right but let's just get on to this substance cuz I want you to see something about substance tonight and I know we'll carry on to later messages go ahead brother Joe and pull up the word substance there in Hebrews 11 and look what it says now remember as I said all the others are dealing with like when you say substance and the substance that they came down with all their substances you know or something like that in the Bible and all it would mean the things they possess and and all but then watch what this gets to all right it means confidence or confidence the word substance means person now they're just giving you the um Hebrew oh excuse me Greek they're giving you the Greek definition of a word they're not supposed to be interpreting it you know they're not supposed to be putting in there what they think they're supposed to be telling you what it says and the things it can relate with so it can be a person watch a setting or placing under thing put under substructure what is a substructure it means something under your structure that is that okay it means you got a structure you got this under this building is a foundation poured footing Etc substructure and you look down to bottom and there's a concrete floor you know substructure underneath the word substance means Foundation that which has Foundation substance is that which has Foundation I hope that I've just got through describing it as to going all the way back to God and coming down and saying in his mind and then he spoke it all right that which has Foundation is firm hence that which has actual existence a substance it's a real being you know what point would you be driving at if you would keep calling it even a person are are are a great super struct uh substructure a great foundation and going back to that which as a foundation if you're not going back to the word of God and God himself right so it's a real being all right now I've asked you the question over and over has God ever showed you something that was going to take place has he ever healed you I mean healed you you know that one minute you're sick the next minute you're well or you're sick one day and three months later you as well what's the difference you know there's more faith in the the gradual than there is over a complete deliverance but you know a lot of people have never experienced what I'm trying to say because I'm talking about the same thing that I talking about Martin Luther when that one day he stood here with a confession he stood here with a saying he was saved he stood here with confessing Jesus Christ as his savior he stood here on one side with with making great proclamations maybe about faith and substances and thing but then one day amen something happened to the man right you think you could get that away from him no Hallelujah come on they burned them in oil they cut babies out of the mothers back there and fed them to the Hogs and they didn't deny Jesus Christ you better have a substance when you're put up against the wall right imaginations won't help you then good feelings won't do it you jump over on the other side you know you know what I mean substance that which has actual existence so now substance then is greater that form of what you then this Oak W because remember the oak wood came because of the substance in the beginning all right it can go to a quality or a nature of a person the steadfastness of your mind firmness courage resolution confidence firm trust assurance what from the word substance now Webster says you know your Webster dictionary substance that of which a thing consist physical matter or material something that has a separate or independent existence you remember we read our is an actual existence Webster says it's something that has a separate or independent existence so everything's independent everything's different everything's you know oak tree pine tree just that way you know dog C at each thing has a separate existence cuz he's saying was the word of God brother Mo used to have a good saying he said substance is what anything exist of whether natural or spiritual and I wrote that down 40 years ago and I you know it's a good statement what do anything consist of because isn't that exactly what we just read from Webster that is what something consists of is physical matter or material it's real even an acorn is real break it on down inside of there is a germ of life that's real Faith then is the substance all right so now remember what we're trying to bring it was not substance first it was Faith first do I need to preach over what I got through this preaching CU I'd hate to have to try it cuz I got to have a bit of that just while I was preaching it would you believe it or not I had to change my whole thing I have already so don't ask me to try to preach it back over you just listen to the tape but I will assure you of one thing faith is the substance of what you hold for when do we get down to evidence faith it was more real in faith than it is in substance you say no it's substance it's it's real over here here okay all this going to be burned up one day now where are you going all these old oak trees and benches and pews and churches are going to burn up where are you going we better back up to Faith because faith is the thing that you're talking about substance is no problem right we just got to get to Faith and if it's not Faith then it's not a substance if it's imagination mental reasoning Etc it's not a substance until faith is made alive so you got to go that way right we keep trying to go this way right remember we keep going this way all this is is going out of existence right I I want to back up this way you know what I mean to anybody on internet or anybody don't understand me I I want to back up not to just in the mind of God because in the mind of God I could bring myself totally out of existence I want to back up into the point of being a part of the mind of God and I cannot lose my faith my faith will hold me I'm talking about faith being more real than any substance you can think of are you listening faith is more real sister Gil than this wood because it brought this wood it's more real than the metal or the car you rode in to get to church the faith it is the substance but you got to get it on faith first we want substance oh yeah I got an arm missing oh yeah when my arm comes back I'll say I got faith that's a scientific fact if that arm appears again it's gone it's that's scientific fact you ain't got nothing to do with faith anything are scientific ific fact ain't got nothing to do with faith come on but if I can stand here and look at it and say my arm God has revealed that it will come back in his time when he wants it to be nothing to me I see my hand listen church I have no parts missing but maybe some of you do here I've heard people talk about that a finger be missing or a hand missing and they can feel still still feel it itch right and they'll be rubbing what you doing that for I can feel that finger when did you get it cut off 20 years ago see the mental connections of the mind and the nerve endings and the things has recorded into our brain some way and those things will work but remember it doesn't say substance is the faith we're turning it around it says faith is the substance of anything thing that we hope for it's real it's not an imagination let me just read a few of what the prophet had actually to say on this I know we won't get through but go ahead number three brother Joe Dr Moses we deal a lot with psychology or whatever how you pronounce them big old words but in Psych ology it doesn't take the place of reality what he said psychology is something you're thinking of are of mentally worked up to walking on colds of fire all kind of things but the reality is God's placing that in confirmation of your psychology you understand what he's saying it starts off mental Faith psychology mental faith God takes your mental Faith makes it a reality by bringing it into a revelation to you if you got a revelation your Revelation is just as solid as God's revelation if it's a revelation all right what faith is substance of things hold far the evidence of Things Not Seen It's actually an Evidence something positive when it's confirmed to you are you listening It's actually an Evidence I show you how far we're going to have to swap this thing backwards brother Joe you're going to have to jump over to number 18 can you do that it'll take him a minute but he'll get to our and listen to what your Prophet has to say on the message have faith in God 1958 paragraph E6 some thinks that it's a mental conception of the word but that is not right faith is a substance to a lot of people in this message think because brother brandham said it I believe it it's a substance that's not right I don't care who it is families or who it is I'm I'm just me they can say all they want to about me but I'm just say in plain language it's not a substance just because you can read it's not a substance we could read the Bible before the prophet came but we had that so actually confused come on look what he says faith is a substance faith is not a myth say faith is a substance of things H for the evidence now listen to have an Evidence it must be a substance I would write that quote down if I were you and read it over and over about 20 times each day to have an Evidence it must be a substance so it's it is not just something that you imagine in your mind it's something that absolutely you have it's something that you possess in your own being now you see why the prophet would say the biggest portion of our faith is mental Faith an Evidence is something proven you know a statement approving to doing see if I can bring it up no an Evidence is reproof a proof that by which a thing is proved or tested that's number 1650 that by which a thing is proved or tested it means a conviction right so now it's if you're going to talk about an Evidence you got to have a substance now you see where you going with your gifts and your signs and your wonders and you're speaking in tongues and you're doing this and you're believing that and Etc what you're calling the evidence of the Holy Ghost there's only one evidence of the Holy Ghost only one evidence of the Holy Ghost and what is it whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word is that right you can call it love you can call it this you can call it that you can call it gifts you can call it all kind of but there's only one evidence of the Holy Ghost right it's whether or not not the spirit in you agrees with the word all right now back to our substance cuz that's what I'm trying to prove I'm talking about faith as something that we don't generally relate to I guess is a better way of saying it without hurting feelings but the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith and mental faith comes by hearing it's not psychology but then God can take if our psychology is right he can take that cuz psychology is a is your doctrine of a mind or thoughts or whatever you are you know you all right he can take that and make it a revelation amen and see what he does he takes our mental faith our hope our imagination our thoughts what did the prophet say when your mental Faith perfect faith Faith there mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation all right we don't lose our mental Faith but I will explain the difference between the mental faith and the spiritual Revelation in this point the world is made up of a lot of different doctrines and in this message and all kind based upon mental Faith but there's only one Supernatural Revelation so there can't be that many doctrines that's right so all of that is a mental Faith now mental faith will never put under your feet something to hold you up unless God comes down to Quicken it right and from my understanding unless I've missed the message in the Bible that God cannot Quicken our thoughts if they're not according to the word I mean if I'm wrong there I'm just wrong because that's what I believe he can't Quicken something that's not right right the Lord revealed to me a trinity and I get up to heaven you ever you ever heard him I get up to heaven and he ain't three up there I'll just turn and walk out cuz I ain't the wrong I'm in the wrong place oh my boy that's great super duper imagination that's that's really what did you see how strong he believes what he believes he said he just walk out walk out of Heaven come on quit being dumb the alone stupid walk out of heaven cuz he said if he went to heaven and they wouldn't tree up there right he just walk out boy that's man he had the Revelation that's a great Revelation he had that's a great Revelation when I seen that brother he dra out that light and it went across this way pulsating and it went over here and it come down here and it created and it come on down and yeah remember mental faith hope whatever is not a substance but faith is the substance all right we'll get back to more in it later but I know we can't go much further we're well familiar with the Rapture message where the Prophet says that faith is a revelation right faith is a revelation so if you say you got a substance you're going to have to have a revelation because a revelation will bring the substance substance don't bring a revelation you're going backward Faith brings the substance remember it's Faith first faith is the substance Faith brings it into being what you're Desiring for we substitute hope for Faith I just hold these other quotes till Sunday well if I preach one if I don't I don't worry about it I'll have for next time but listen Church you can't be saved by mental Faith but yet you must have mental Faith before you can become s right right you can't be healed by mental Faith but yet you must have mental Faith to come to a healing Factor that's right all right that's why people that are lost can be healed because it's not based on the same basis as salvation is based upon you know that the healing part is not all but remember the illustration or the point I kept trying to bring Faith is the substance all you've done is moved it or what would be a word I don't understand it folks I don't have that education but what you do is you take Faith God took didn't take Faith he was faith and from what his thinking was and his you know his whole Faith makeup he just said let there be and it became a substance right that's right of what he was hoping for which was a world right right and a people to live on that world so he went from his Revelation he brought it down closer to Earth and made a substance out of it we've got to go that way so what we've got to do is declare that we're already healed before he can make it a revelation there's were the problems at we got to declare that we're saved before he can make it a substance he doesn't save us give us a substance come on that's right you're going to have to say it first and say it by not just a mental imagination come on I remember something I can't remember exact story but maybe brother Ram didn't tell the person but I'll put it like this that there was somebody that was real sick sick like a young lady and his point was maybe some of you can help me remember it but his point was to the girl if God heal you what would you do right would you glorify God or would you go back to where you was you see if it was a faith substance she wouldn't consider going back to where she was but if it was a mental conception she'd go back to that point I illustrated by a lady we were talking to a young lady we were trying to introduce him to the message and somebody said something about we're going to have a glorified body well I'm sorry I just there she was with short dress and painted face and all kind of things but when it come down to speaking about going back to a glorified body she was just and I didn't have to have no great discernment to know what she's talking about would you if I said she was talking about you mean this body that I've got is about 20 30 pound overweight it's going to come down to beauti and I'm going to be beautiful and I'm I mean that's what I thought because of her reactions is that what the prophet said about the girl if God healed you what would you do see church Faith then comes before the substance matter can be considered but here we are we don't wait for the faith to confess the substance because we're going backwards if you don't get anything whatsoever tonight I'll don't get this point let's confess What God Says then he can make it a substance right but as I said if you ever had him to come speak to you when you knew what it was going to be you had no troubles you know what you done done you done got the substance before you ever even thought about it being out in the body to heal it or anything you had a revelation see then it's not only just talking about creating world or whatever I want to go back and be part of that that's in God's mind before the world when he thought of what he was going to do but to do that I must stand here and take God's word and I'm sick I need healing I must stand here and say by his stripes I am already positively healed salvation Salvation believe in your heart confess with your mouth is that the scripture you got to say it before you can have it that's right you got to say that you're saved before you can be saved but then when God quickens that to you it's over right when he makes that alive to you it's over yeah we can do like a man did at work one day he said I used to wonder about being a Christian because there's so many troubles going my way but said one day I found out Christians have troubles so I know I got to be saved why because you're having a lot of troubles is that what you're saying because you got a lot of troubles remember job wouldn't guilty we want to make all of our tests and trials you know I'm sorry now blunt we want to go out and do something wrong and get venial disease and then say I'm in a test sorry for being blunt but you'll think it over that's tempting that's not testings That's what Satan put before you a test is when you're right job wasn't wrong the reason he was tested he was right that's right well all them problems coming my way it might be that we got a lot of wrong well let God Brother D I've checked it all out well maybe that is where we need a prophet because remember one time I doing a story that was telling and this young person was having a lot of trouble and nobody couldn't figure it out he sat there and told him said you stole money from a church when you were 16 years old did you go make it right and God will heal you oh but I confessed all of them I asked God to forgive me of all of that all of that's gone remember the lady that they couldn't figure out what was wrong with her brother brand went back in her life and said you remember the day you was running around on your husband she had that so pressed down till the psychologist couldn't get it out of her she was a Sunday school teacher but you see Church we're missing what faith really is faith is a revelation of God's will for your life and mind you see why the prophet said we need a revelation more than anything you know you can't be saved without a revelation you want to quote you can't be saved without a revelation well I can't accept remember the first I can't accept Revelation he said then you can't be saved but did the person do anything about it no they went away I am Sav bless go he can't tell me like I told a man here one time I said the way you're acting shows me you're not saved he went around told everybody I said he's lost I never did say is lost I said the way you're acting right come on I had a right to say that didn't I where you're acting Christ don't act like that that's right but of course everybody's on his side brother Dale you shouldn't have told him his lost I didn't tell him he lost he told me he was lost that's right come on faith is the substance of what's your hope are so we start out saying I hope I'm safe right come on ain't a person in the building didn't start out that away I hope I'm saved what do you do you keep confessing it until he saves you then you're delivered right he's brought a substance into being a reality because of substance is something you possess when I stood at that doctorine life that day and told him I said you won't take my kneecap off I spoke from something besides myself I still got my kneecaps how many times have you ever been healed and like I said the other day then we turn around and somebody come around and say well I'm Healed I'm this that or the other you say I'm Healed of cancer I got a complete bill of help from saying that you know I had cancer and God heal me I say it's totally wiped out in my body well what it is now uh uh that sign ific fact can't cover back but 4,000 or something meters goes and all that stuff so that means that journey is still laying that jemy is still in there but you it just ain't showing up on records you are a great help wonderful I love to hear you talk like that well a doctor give me a complete Bill people got a complete bill of health and died three days later you're a wonderful help devil gone on vacation he don't have to be around we're so smart but if you ever get a substance I'll guarantee you one thing I asked somebody the other day she said I've had it one time but if you ever get one time if you're ever delivered one one time from a sickness no matter if you got it instantly or if you had to wait on it don't make no difference but during that time you could not be talked out of your healing because it had been said how many of you would stand like I did when I told my wife I said that will happen or I'll never preach again come on why can't we be put on the spot that's right if you got the goods you ain't got to worry about it right see the reason I'm not afraid of what I preach is because I've always tried to preach what the prophet brought in the Bible so then I'm Not Afraid are you challenging the world no I'm just saying to the world I ain't afraid of you come on show me where I'm wrong God I want to be right that's right but can you stand on a substance now I going to say this word and then quit has it ever been revealed to you there just one God or is it still just an imagination if it's been revealed to you you have the substance of all almighty God and you don't mind it being tested that's right come on musicians you don't care if the world's against you if you got a substance right I tell the dream that I had one time some of you have heard it you don't put everything on a dream but sometimes they good dreams and I dream about 10 times every night so I'm an old dreamer garbage can dreams and everything else but in a dream one night I was standing in my front yard most of the clouds storms comes directly from the front yard from over pice W's house coming to that way is our worst storms worst wind and the thing and then this dream I was standing there and not just trees flying but great big boulders almost as big as this church was flying through the air right by me I was just standing there and all at once out of that horrible boulders and all come a man riding on a horse he rode right straight towards me and he stopped now all of these Boulders flying by and he stopped he looked at me and he said don't use that how many of you have heard me tell a dream don't use that I look down in my hand I had a slingshot hallu a guy come riding out of big old Boulders and storms and things but he was afraid of a slingshot and he said don't use that I thought we understood that it was not David that killed Goliath but yet he had a slingshot and in that slingshot he had a rock in those rocks he had Faith see the devil is afraid of your faith he ain't afraid of your statements you're talking you're rattling he'll rattle with you but he's afraid of it when you take God's word and say that's it right that's what it says there's just one true and living God there's just one way in the Bible to be baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ not father Son and Holy Ghost I'm just stand on the word right there wasn't but one Prophet promised for the end time to come there's not but one bride promised in the end time I just want to be a part of it don't you let's stand what we got brother let's go 152 red book 152 in the red book anybody have a need so if you ever get a substance Faith you will know what I'm talking about I care
