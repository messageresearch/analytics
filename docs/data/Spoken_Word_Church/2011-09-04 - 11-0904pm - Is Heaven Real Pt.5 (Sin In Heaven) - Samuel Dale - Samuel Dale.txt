Among Us way June will be traveling back sometime today I don't know where he's preaching this evening what he's doing but be traveling back home and just remember each one that the Lord would bless and guide uh each and every one of us if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Revelations 12 now I got to do two parts this afternoon so I'm going to drop back a little bit for the morning and carry over because I'm sure that I will not complete the uh what I want to bring out on Revelations 12 but we will go as far as we can and just get as much and then we'll we'll try to uh uh bring maybe the rest of it Wednesday but we'll be dropping back to just to Heart okay so just remember that remember pray one for another the Lord would bless father we thank you we love you and truly you are the rock of our Salvation that's right truly you hide our soul thank you Jesus in The Cliff of your rocken when all is over and all is finished then we will be able to realize realization and realize that this Earth was a wonderful place to be and a wonderful time because here is where we start our journey here's where we will end our journey and all will be made well and father then we go to meet you in the air we love you and we thank you and just be with each one be with the sick among us cuz you said it you said I sent my word and healed them yes thank you Lord and delivered from destruction we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen now I I said it's going to be hard to cover because I'm going to have to just break down Revelations 12 and uh don't worry about it we can come back later and eventually pull it over in after the Rapture and you'll see that it will tie into to Israel and their Journey etc etc but we're not concerned with that part we're just wanting to get what is to be known known for this day and the hour so Revelations 12:1 and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child cried she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven horns and SE and having seven horns and 10 crowns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the Third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for it to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a Manchild who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne and the woman fled Into the Wilderness where she had the place prepared of God that they should feed her for 1,23 score days now here's the point what we want to get to because that shows something back here then we're coming down and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and Prevail not neither was there a place found anymore in neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him then there something glorious will happen that we probably won't get this far but and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we ended up this morning talking about you know that how real God is and how real heaven is because I believe that God is a you know he's a greater higher beyond anything that we we could comprehend right right but yet he's a being right and then I believe heaven is real because that was where he was at yes he existed in heaven now we're not concerned with where it comes down to different things later and Heaven and Earth will pass away you know and this out of the other I'm just kind of like the old brother that said you know I'm glad that it says in the word abide it forever cuz if Heaven and Earth away than the world of God so we don't have to worry about it but we know that it's not Annihilation it is changing from one form to another right just as you receiving the new birth that was not the annihilation of your soul that was just changing the form that it was in which was sin and changing it into eternal life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost ghost so it's not an Annihilation the only thing that I know of that will ever be annihilated is the devil and his angels in hell that's right and you show me anything else that will be annihilated I'd like to see it see once you destroy that then you don't have to worry about anything everything will be done and you know and God will be in command all but now I'm trying to put the point across this morning strongly to you that God is real we say that he's a spirit but in comparison to where the dimensions we are here to get to a Heavenly place as we would call it and then we in this part of the earth the word Spirit just means no form it's just you don't put a form to a spirit you know it's just floating around well that's our definition here but in the place we would call heaven and he being who he is and and all and being a spirit what would that word mean there you cuz Even in our natural languages you say something in a natural language here and you say it in English you better be careful how that you uh translate that into uh some other language I told you about when I was in Brazil when I was trying to make an emphasis about you know that God made a help meet you know it doesn't say help me in Genesis it's help meet in and I was trying to emphasize that about sister Cesar and they all when it was translated I mean they just was having them a hilarious time life and and I knew something was wrong and I looked over in my I said to The Interpreter I said something went wrong well we've got to get together and what did you say he said well I translated what you said I said yeah but it didn't come out right cuz something's messed up you know and me and him standing talking like this they're still just dying laughing I said tell me what you said about her he said well I told her she would have help meet you know she was meat me a I said that's not what the the Bible says and that wasn't what I said I said don't call her that call her a help meet me he never seen in the Bible and he actually read it see right there and because he was reading what I was to saying so he got it back I said get it together let's see what does it mean he said oh you me you I said well now tell her what I mean she's wonderful she's part of him she's this because when you use the word me t it means part of you see a woman become and man becomes one what if you're just to have mate two men can be a mate come on we're in the wrong days right two women can be a mate right it doesn't have anything it doesn't get it in the right order so God didn't say that so get what I'm saying in the language we're using we try to express what we see but in comparison to what it would be in the Heavenly language when all of us around the world would be able to one way to just understand exactly what somebody says and what it's meant see so it's so much above we'll read to it when we get it it's so much above this this is not even in the picture all right but now we were talking about that the first Creation in heaven the prophet of God said and I gave it to you this morning that God was his first creation all right and in doing that him being the first creation now it's like a sister mentioned outside you know I won't say what she said but see you can get confusing because when you say the beginning of the creation of God all right now here's our click computer brother said anything had a beginning had an ending see now we just killed the whole thought yeah amen because brother Ram was saying God was his first creation but his first creation was himself moving over into understanding or to Bringing himself to a basis toward us that we could comprehend him not that he had a beginning right see we just use that word beginning so loosely till we say anything has a beginning has an ending to it right well then you'd say Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God well then well he's another person then no he's God made manifest right he's a being he's real all right so that's what I wanted to make sure you understand and I know most of you here have been with me long enough and I've read these many times but still we're going out now to the basis that some people begin to wonder maybe somebody heard that you know and they say let's see brother R said God was his first creation that's a creation is bringing something something from from I read you the definition of it that it can come from even a thought into manifestation and be called a creation see so get don't be so quick to snatch the words and just hang on to that just loosen up and let it let it under give understanding to what we're doing so I wanted to read a couple of about three quotes from the morning's message that I didn't get to and then we'll start in the evening okay so bear with me so if they'll pull up brother Joe uh it wasn't so from the beginning 1960 306 E10 right so let's just see what brother randam has to say about this great person that we're talking about this great almighty God when his whole desire from the very beginning is always been to reveal himself am to his creation yes to show himself to his family you know to bring into being himself to where that we can comprehend him but listen what your Prophet has to say now God is omnipotent omnipresent by being omnicient he knows to be there so he can makes him omnipresent he he knows all things but God could not be just like the IR is now listen to your problem Prophet because God has a Dwelling Place God is not a myth God is a being God Jesus he God pronoun he is a being therefore he's omnicient omnipresent omnipotent infinite now see then we say that he's just a spirit and see mankind believes he's just like the wind the amoya in Africa and see but watch brother BR said then if it is you breathe in and out see I breathe out brother collie breathes in that would be a mo you're going between me and him because it's just like breath amen but it's not that way God is a being he's real all right now what's going down he's not a myth that's right go he said he has a Dwelling Place amen where does God dwell in heaven what's the problem with that all right look on down to the next one adoption U part 3 62 I mean 6522 the morning service paragraph 51 he comes down talking about this spars and he says he's omnicient he knows everything but he is a being God is a being and out of this being begin to bring forth things now brother Ram didn't have to break it down as I said when this morning trying to emphasize it when we say God oh God's an object of worship now brother brandom never said God is an object of worship in every time he used the word God when he was Des describing what God is yes but he had no trouble saying God he didn't mean that object of worship he could be talking about the very God of creation all of the whole thing he can be talking about the very Elohim the self-existing all right because he's real look what the next one answer to say is what I like cuz you'd be like theoa see the are going in and out if you wouldn't careful this is from the message Fellowship e19 uh 1966 111b he talking about God being is a being now God's just not like you're like the a if he would you would never have to seek the Holy Ghost it would be in you cuz he'd F all space and things God God I'm the present sure by being omniscient omnicient means he knows everything is I no problem knowing all things but God has a dwelling place because he is a being exactly right and God dwells with Fellowship under the shed blood of his son and that alone amen not Upon Our denomination or affiliation upon the shed blood we meet God face to face he's a being now we'll read another one when it come out to one on the Eden CH see he's not like the wind that's right right well I've seen him in the Whirlwind amen but you know what brother R said about that he said the Whirlwind wouldn't God that's right he said it's what he's veiled in that's right but see we we think about it we think we've heard so much all right number next one if you will which is things that are to be 1965 1205 paragraph 42 all right look what he says he said Heaven is a real place he said it's not like my mother used to tell me you know that we get up there and we it is and we' be doing that see in a place called Heaven and the musicians would be able to play well I can't play here I figure I won't be able to there I'm not concerned about it I'm just concerned with getting there you know all but he said after the opening of The Seven Seals now I emphasized this the other day purposely for the point when brother random went beyond the curtain of time you don't hear him here referring to to the point he's getting at beyond the curtain of time was real to him right but here he's talking about the word the word is more real than anything else that's right Satan can impersonate those things that's right show you Visions dreams whatever but he can't impersonate the word so he said because the opening the seals now we understand I believe that heaven is a real place just the same as this a real is a real place see for God started us in our spiritual growth in this place right here and I believe that heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't set up there for eternity and just sit there on a cloud we don't just strum our harp for all all from here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things where we're going to live we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life to a real eternal life we're going to heaven a paradise going to heaven a paradise heaven is real God is real that's the point I'm trying to get you to see the whole thing of me preaching this whole thing that we've been on this is message number five you been talking about is heaven real I've been asking you that question is your heaven real is your God real or is it just the mythologies or thoughts but I'm sincere you want to go with the prophet and talk about sincerity where that over in some of those countries they take their babies and they feed them to an alligator to try to appease that God you want to talk about sincerity see let's don't get into that let's just get down to reality of life and living and and doing and things and being who we are now back up then just to what we were talking about this morning what that the first creation was God himself and then from that he created the Loos the word the theophany the Son of God in other words he set from one form which would be totally to where you don't even have any comprehension of whatsoever he begins to what would be a better way you tell me the words I'll use them but he began as the prophet said to change his form so we can get some idea about this God so he moves over into the word form and he begins to be in that word form No Angel no molecules no Earth no doings nothing here in heaven so he creates angels and they worship him and that makes him as our English word god an object of worship and those angels are worshiping Angels that's where Satan the the kingdom of the north go study it get into the to the doings and even get back into the to the Old Testament and watch the the layout of the children of Israel and and the 12 tribes and the things how they would count and they count like three three three and three you know or whatever uh you know and it's got to move out a certain way they got to go this man can't go before this man it's all got to do this then you got to worship altar see Satan is a worship he loves beautiful music he's worship Angel he was in charge of all of the the worship in heaven now I like what brother George Canada said years ago one time he's talking he said when those angels said they look at him and they see him and said they say Glory Glory Glory he said they look back and they see him again and they see more of him and they say glory glory glory and look back and see more of Him Glory Glory Glory so the more every time it's not just a well that be the dumb I mean the the dullest place to be to sit there listen somebody Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory 24 hours a day 7 Days of a week for about 10,000 years but it wouldn't be if every time you said Glory Glory Glory you saw him a little higher you saw a little more of him you saw him as he was beginning to unfold itself then you'd want them angels to sing Glory Glory Glory but but the first was created was Angels see that was before anything natural natural world atmospheres life stars moon etc for anything he created angels and they worshiped him for billions of trillions of me because there was no time and as I said this morning then we talk about angels is being something running around with wings who did we get that from there is illustrations yes but where did we get that all angels have wings and then where did we get Glory under put her in all of this stuff as a female angel there is no such thing as a female nor male Angel they're masculine in the look because God is masculine right but they are not masculine in the point they cannot have children they cannot procreate none of that is involved and they were made for a specific purpose to worship God right but they also had another meaning involved in it cuz the Bible said that there the angels are ministering Spirits sent to the children of the HS of Salvation they you that job back there you remember two or three services ago when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy we saw those angels worshiping was we back there not this people no no no no know we were in him yes am in him we've been down through it but now listen heaven then is a real place just as say is we're in a real place that's what we just got through reading that was what I was ending up this morning it's number one coming back up on uh to where we're talking about so let's get down to who is this mches that was uh things that already be let's go to number one now and just get started on what we're talking about cuz I want to keep this in your mind to where we can see it and see how God is and how great he is then we can understand okay paragraph 48 who is this mzc 1965 through 21 to evening service now notice those who have have tonight eternal life was with him in him in his thinking before the was ever an angel star cherubim or anything else that's Eternal and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here but the shape and form of the infinite God Amen now break it right there when God stepped over into another form to be known as the Son of God the Loos the Creator he didn't wait to get there to create us that's what we just read before there was any of those things if you have eternal life right cuz now see if you don't understand how that he could be a creation he just stepped into another form that's right if we wasn't in heaven in God in the beginning as the eternal life that we have within us now you understand me the eternal life that we have within us not this thing you're looking at I just read he said not your being here no body Spirit Soul form so get all that out of the way right see then we never had a beginning right that's why your Prophet could say it right he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal amen hallelujah look what the people though take of the message I don't need to get the Holy Ghost I always was eternal now where did brother randam say that he said we begin our eternal life right here right well what do you mean he said was always Eternal he said the eternal life you have if you have eternal life was that what he said those who have eternal life does who have tonight eternal life was with him in him in his thinking whether we just in his thinking he would just he just thinking about us well that's wonderful that's as far as you can comprehend that's true but we've been quite a while studying on the thoughts of God right and the things and we found out the thoughts of God are Eternal that's right and that he can never have a new thought that's right right right right so then if he thought of you in the beginning you know watch you in the beginning with him but not as people that's what we want to do we want to get this person involved out here right then you look at it and you tell me I'm wrong somebody come and tell me I'm wrong about it every doctrine that has run with that that you always was eternal has wound up in the bed of adultery with young girls and all kind of things you want me to name names no it wouldn't do no good cuz it wouldn't change nobody right but you check your pastor and say check him out he starts preaching about everything oh I always was eternal I could just feel it I was oh just sweetly I just love it cuz I was always there with him I just feel it all over me yeah Napoleon did too lot people might not understand that symbolics but Napoleon claimed he was reincarnation but listen I'm not talking about junk I'm talking about something that's real that's right amen a real God Amen not your being here right but the form of the infinite God look what he goes on to say omnicient makes him omnipresent God is a being he's not like the wind I remember a certain brother in this message years ago he put out some books how we built a house wrong so you know who it was somebody he said well to me God is just like the wind he's just blowing everywhere just blowing and I asked brother calling looking at me grinning cuz he knows what went wrong and I asked this brother said well see her to him God is like the wind I said that was my brother Brown said he said well he just saying it's like to him I don't care what he said what brother Brown say brother R said he's not like the wind amen right right you know God don't have to be in heaven don't have to be on the moon right now unless there's somebody up there he's omniscient omnipresent what he's omnipresent in that he's omniscient he knows to be there if he needs to be there the first time they went to the moon they came back and told you that there were two or three objects followed him there and back he had to go as a witness all right but look what he say because he knows that he dwells he is a being not like the wind he he is a being he dwells in a house oh my God my God don't need a house am why why is it we've always tried to make him one did did he not come down when they got through making him a house come on see we think well we just quote words words don't mean anything there's no Revelation that's right look what he goes on to say things that are to be 1965 1205 paragraph 38 he's omnipresent because he's omnicient omnicient because he's omnipresent therefore by his for knowledge now he can't be just like the wind be can't be just like the wind over the Earth because he is a being he just isn't a mid he's a being he dwells he even dwells in a house he dwells in a place called heaven right God dwells in a place called Heaven well why can't we believe Heaven is real H why can't we believe that except cuz he said I gave you the one quote where he said we wouldn't have to pray for the Holy Ghost if he's just like the wind it just be going everywhere but he's a being I thought we believe that we were created in the image of God now brother Dale you sure get no no no no don't break it down too far to us cuz we're going to get all confused now you already are forget it he had some image or idea of a way to make a man and he must have made him in his image that's just a spiritual man well where the natural one come from but it come from the animals where animals come from you get what I'm saying see we think that we've got it all figured out and I'm sorry I wish to God that he had never called me to preach you think it never you you you think that brother Dale wants to preach show what he believ I'd love to quit just sit down cuz I bungled the whole thing up trying my best to get you to see the God I'm talking about I know I have cuz I just can't able to get get it into words just let somebody else take it and carry it on and break it down but until that time you're going to have to put up with me all right I put up with you okay we got a partnership yeah we have fun doing it all right we can sing Happy Birthday the only problem we got is he never has sung happy birthday three times in in April they sang it three times today get you the last a second get it but we have a wonderful time everybody looks at us on this internet system they probably die laughing they probably turn us on and the wackest quack as video message people I get but we have fun doing it but you know sometimes we get serious and you know God's been good to us but now look God dwells in heaven so wouldn't we realize that heaven is real he dwells in heaven right now brother D's out here in a Dimensions floating around he can be there too he can be anywhere he wants to like they asked me last night about it you know that one day when Jesus Christ died you know that his soul went to hell that's right you agree now if my soul went to hell I wouldn't be able to get out you better consider something so it wasn't this his soul went down like we think about what we are and it certainly wasn't you know the the uh the being because his body was laying in the grave but see he was capable of being able to move between all of those Dimensions that we can't you said but now wait a minute brother Brandon went to hell did Brother randam go to hell as a person if he did he can't get back out so you better be careful what you're saying that's right amen he went there in a vision right or translation or what you want to call it but you better believe that he was body he was laying back down there and wiggling on that bed when he was down there when that little boy was shot so his soul couldn't leave that body if it did the body's dead you better get it it straight think a little bit every once in a while instead of thinking you know so much about it but listen folks look what the prophet let's take a little bit we'll try to talk about heaven and then we've got to get to the point of and if I don't I'll just finish this up and then we'll take up Wednesday about uh sin originating in heaven but look what he says in 1961 uh number 1961 um 412 4 402 excuse me paragraph 136 the true Easter seal all right look what he says I tell you you read all up and down that's why give you the whole thing we can give you a short line quick just like that and I give you the whole quote I give it to them out on the internet they can sit and read up above there and they can see what is coming context is and they can come down and follow his context but then they can see what he's talking about I like to get it like that look what he says he talking about being out there on Mount uh Palmer in California and seeing those things now think look at through a telescope I think 120 million years of light space how many miles would that be to be broke down when light travels at so many feet per second and light is and am I right Aaron light is the only thing that's got one number the only stable thing is light and they can give you the exact how many feet it is and what all of this is look but yet Heaven is so many billions and billions and billions of light years beyond that are you reading it in other words they can look up to hundreds to 120 million years of light space evidently they've ever been able been able to look that far but he said Heaven is so much so many billions and billions and billions of light years beyond that till it's not even thought of how would we get there he said TR like I thought don't worry about it like I told him there last night brother brand I tell you what we keep listening to him you keep doing you going to find answer to every question you got and we're talking about how that Jesus when he was was there said don't touch me I'm not yet ascended he went up brother random said and this is quoting him he said he come back so fast till he come right to the wall science says you pass one object to the other object in the fourth dimension and it won't te it up brother Ram knew something what he talking about he said he came back so fast he W went right straight through the wall and could stand there and feel me then give me something to eat see we think of time and light and doings you know that's why brother man said I'd love have been able to talk to Einstein and said to been there to hearing when he made that great speech about the his finite Universe when Einstein says you look out like that and with unlimited eyesight you just keep looking straight out he said you see the back of your head what he say see we said that's impossible because everything is in a circular everything is in a war all of this stuff that we've seen for many years of all of that space travels and things like that it's not as far off as we think you know the Lost in Space that they went out and they couldn't come back see right now to be able to go without there's only one little Gap don't ask me what it means I don't know I just know they can't do it and it's sure it's funny if they can't go up on the clouds on now that's something a it they got sitting on a pad probably 2 or300 billion dollar worth of equipment sitting in one place and five or six guys sitting there and they're getting ready to go into outer space boy we go and ain't nothing control us about that time comes on so get out boys and come on back down cuz it's coming up a cloud oh boy ain't that silly cuz it's got something to do with that passing out and coming back I don't understand it I just what to say look what he says on the message the way of a true Prophet paragraph 172 1962 513 the morning service look what he says and if Heaven is so great and where we're going to then if we can't line up with a little bitty Petty things how how are we going to line up with the spirit there got to line with the word if we can't understand a little petty things here and get over all of that where are we questions and answers 1964 8:30 the morning service paragraph Was questions and answers part three I get uh paragraph 21 he's talking about negative and positive and the different things that are happening and the picture is absolutely this is the negative the negative part of life life is where we're living now in anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if it is a neg therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere and this ain't the real thing this is only a shadow of the real thing that is to come now you got it cuz it goes on up into the heavens he says you can't destroy it right it's in heaven you can't destroy it all of this could burn up right now everything we are whole atmosphere we're in could be annihilated it wouldn't touch one thing of Heaven that's right that's what brother Dale believes God I believe it's real yes sir okay I believe it's a real place but here's the thing that will cover for a little while cuz we got this a little bit that we think of the Angels being the first creation go ahead brother Joe and pull up the one where starts about which would be uh the greatest battle ever fought go ahead and just pull it up he's probably got it up there they get ahead of me most of the time they one splick second to a second ahead of but and we think about heaven now if you don't think about heaven being real I want you to than with me for just a a second I like to prove things you know the Bible says prove all things and the whole fast that which is good I like to prove it this is the way I like to prove it well brother Dale how do you know that heaven is real you ain't never been there you never had no visions of it have it no no no you never traveled there have you dreams or no no no no no well how do you know it's real because I believe the prophet of God that brought us the message now how many people how many theologians how many Scofield or whatever you know all of it they bounce up and down a little bit on the things and and not Scofield U the Great theologians but you know what makes me think about heaven being real more real than anything cuz that's where sin started I know I'm a funny thinking person I agree with you but that's where sin started it didn't start on earth right right CU you see only thing we got on Earth to talk about Sin Sin what is sin smok and drinking ging running around women and brother Brown kept emphasizing that's not sin do you do you get what I'm saying that makes me realize Heaven is more real than anything that I could ever think about is because sin become there now how many of us are saying how many people do you know or any doctrinal ideas that ever had any thought that sin originated in heaven no they wondering about down in the garden we don't know what happened we wasn't there you wasn't there nobody knows so we don't know we just what is just sin it started in heaven right now let's do away with some thoughts all right so it's impossible for sin to be drinking gambling smoking running around with women adulteries or anything that can't be sin cuz the Angels had no ability to do any of those things right case closed right see that's why people don't come and talk to me about it that's when I preach they won't come because what you going to do with that I mean what in all your carnalities and your arguments and you can argue all day long with me they going to be standing there holding up one finger then when you get through I got another statement to make which was the first one the angels have no gender they have no no Humanity or whatever you want to call it they have no ability drink smoke down but they were the first Sinners well brother you think all right drink smoke G it's all right if you want to be lost yeah it is it's all right go and do it if that's what you want to do just help yourself that's right cuz you're not a Christian anyway those are only displaying that's right the attribute of the unbelief that's inside of you that's right amen then inside of you is an unbelief that you need to deal with that's right but what do you mean brother I believe in God well now that's that's the thing we're going to deal with don't you believe that them Angels believed in God now we just plainly talking this afternoon I'll finish it Wednesday I know I won't get through but don't you believe them Angels believe in God but they wound up in sin right whether you want to call it a third of them 2/3 of them whatever you want to do it's feel a big number but I want you to remember too that ain't no telling how many billions of years that it took for those angels to go develop into unbelief right because Satan doesn't work fast that's right but those angels have no way of smoking drinking G and R around with women it wasn't made that way right but they were the original sinners now what happened there and what I want us to Simply think about is ourselves right right ourselves right yes higher higher some of you getting sleepy I want us to think about ourselves amen if I wrote down I said okay what I want you to do I want you Wednesday night to turn into definition to me of what sin is I wonder what we'd all have up wrote down well let's disbel God now the Angels never disbelieve God that's why brother brand said Eve in the garden she knew God was real she didn't disbelieve God being real right come on am I quoting the message amen what was eeve sin cuz what her sin was is what the sin was in heaven see all we seeing Eve some lustful sexual feelings get all that out of your mind until you get down to seeing what really sin is and a man stand like he is that was so dedicated to the word is he that he said I live have lived so close to God I'm quoting brother ROM he said I've lived so close to God till I forc the gifts and the things to work a man if you couldn't put one mark on his life right right oh they tried to do a lot of it they ain't done it yet but they said brother Bram do you see he said every day now what was he talking about well we got a definition we don't practice that's still old bad this Presbyterian Doctrine you know we use that word where it said don't commit sin we translated that over into practice and start boy we thought it had fig all figured out the prophet of God said I sin every day the Bible says anything that is not a faith is sin we automatically you ate too much no you just don't to get sick you say it's a sin to eat too much well then let's just break it on down a little further then if you're going to count this sin as being eaten too much and then you you you justify it by saying look at the poor world out there that doesn't have anything to eat well why don't you cut down a couple of more potions of what of the eat of that day and send it to them oh brother Dale talks too straight don't he you get what I'm saying yes like brother mon said you take a 55 gallon drum you fill it up with water is full you take a 3/4 in water pipe you fill it up with water it's full sure we do we destroy our bodies by eating too much yes yes but then we want to make some sin as some little some form CU we've developed enough to know that it's not the great big so now we're going to be dealing on sin this service and probably another 10 I'm going take 20 but look what brother Rand had to say the first great battle 1962 311 the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 62 this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so see did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels become human battles right so when at when Satan sinned remember it was a created being the first we'll get to why he got upset see CU he thought he was a right-and man and he was he just didn't understand the story but we've got to cover a little part right here see the first thing in heaven was Angels created everybody with me for this morning first thing in heaven was Angels that's you're still in heaven uh now before we get to the sin of what is finished and I want to say it because what brother around just said he said it started in heaven and then came to Earth so Somewhere in Heaven that logos theophany word Angel Son of God U Halo of light had created a world okay he had created a world you're going to see what I'm talking about just a second so you go to Genesis 1 and what do you find why would brother random find me a place that brother random didn't make this statement when he quoted the scripture he'd always say in the beginning God God created the heavens and the Earth period is that right he you remember his little girl said Daddy said to the world is millions of years old and he said that's right he said because honey God created the heavens and the Earth perod he said he could let it goone for millions of millions of years that's right now let's go back and read this see that's where I love the Bible let's read the Bible go back to Genesis 1 okay we'll just stay with what part we can get to and then we'll just pick up the rest of it Wednesday I want you to watch something we try to make the days in the garden that's right but we're going to read that the world come into existence was not the creation of the first day get your Bible are you with me that wasn't the first day my brother Brown said period every time he said he could laid for millions of years yes so let's see what this world look like in the beginning God see doesn't have any trouble there and you translate that word God over and that word God is translated from Elohim you got a scull field Bible right down under it so it does brother him to call him God and it's not in a capital letter as it appears in a couple of chapters later we've been through that right in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period now what did it look like let's still get in the first day now we got to get verse three to get the first day what does it look like and the Earth Earth was without form and void meaning no life and without a definite form okay and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters then he started day one with verse tree and begin to create light you get what brother random is saying you get what he's emphasizing could laid millions of billions of years in that state all right now let's reread what we just read from Brother Brown okay go back brother Joe to number six on your notes the greatest battle ever fought 1962 six PR 62 and look this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his Angel was fought against lucier and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings all right what kind of a battle took place in heaven oh people this man you know this Michael he knows more about karate he just he he know everything and no I don't think so that's right I think when it come and you can take my ATT fart whatever you want to you got yours there come a time as I said this morning that what took care of those angels during all of that time that they were planning to take over cuz that's what Lucifer was doing he was planning to take over yes who took care of that is because God turned his back some way turned his mind how does he keep from seeing you and I sinning his Omni presence would make him know exactly what we do that's right but he's got something between doesn't him but after a while when it was all finished Michael said hold it and I'm sure he probably draw a line on the floor of heaven he said all it's on God's side get over here he said right Lucifer all is on your side get over there right he turned to him and he said into outer Darkness shall you go see because outter Darkness had already been created that's what I'm getting you at first he created angels then that logos stood there and created a world but it was in outer Darkness I even believe in The Big Bang Theory you want brother Brown's Big Bang Theory The Big Bang Theory is what that it was all once of gases and molecule that everything was in one and then all at once it started slinging on and that started slinging off and it was caused by an explosion from internal that just sent everything scattering through you know and it was once a big ball lot you want brother brand to tell you about that I didn't bring because I think he needed that he said Dar was and said what did he do he said it's all just gases and said he just starts slinging off clinkers you ever heard him say that he said he throw it out said it went for a 100 million years he said he stopped it he off goes another one he said what's he doing he's creating the Stars he said what's he really doing said he's writing his Bible in the star brother R bu believed in come some form of a Big Bang Theory and I like his theory the best but all come out the same thing MH it's just science trying to explain it and they can explain it that's true They're bringing back stuff from these other planets now but you know what they're finding on some of these other planets now that it could be the earliest form of any form of life there is no life there but all of the things are there are you reading what what you're bringing back see it all com for one time God said let there be he slung it out who done that Jesus Christ the word the logos of theop and he let it all sling but it was in darkness and when Satan was cast out of heaven where was he put outer Darkness this Earth is not this Earth our the domain of the devil you want the scriptures you want brother brandham he said I'll give you the scriptures where every Kingdom in the world belongs to the devil that's right said he even tried to give them to Jesus it was made his domain so you see brother randam is not just quoting something to make us my children to understand he said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth perod he said he could let it late for millions and millions of years amen so Satan could have been here on Earth for millions and millions of years in darkness okay simply giving you a run through all right so let's talk about him in just a minute now if sin originated in heaven what was that sin it could not have been that the Angels didn't believe in God cuz there he was so let's go on down a little bit deeper than to just think about you say well but Brother D I believe in God I believe everything brother Brown says how many quotes that but where are they when the church doors open say it okay S I believe everything brother R said brother said you do not have to have something to tell you it's wrong to commit adultery then you don't believe if you do that okay soloft you know what I mean by k s somebody out there might not know what that means to us it just means tell me something that's say cuz you can't do it and then laid the case out and it's soft well that don't matter to me I tell you what I believe what I want to believe you just go right and believe what you want to believe anyway cuz you are but one day we'll find out that's and it won't be this man looking down on you as a stick of hatred and say I tried to tell you it'll be the same tears within my eyes are saying I tried my best to tell you about this God Amen to see God and see how real he is to see Heaven and the things look down on what we're going let's read a couple and this we'll quit on 10 then we'll start Wednesday the unfailing realities of the Living God preached in 196 626 paragraph 225 remember sin didn't begin on Earth sin began in heaven when Lucifer taken and made him watch he said I want a denomination oh that's where we all come from but how much do we still have left as brother Mo used to make a good statement he said you can take your coat and hat and you can walk out of one Church and stick it up on the wall of another one what good have you done you still got the same Doctrine true Satan wanted a denomination that's right course he was going to be the head of it right he said I want a denomination make a great big thing went on the North Country Now he in the Bible as I said this morning you study the kingdom of the north and that's where the the king is to come down and then you get into worship alar and you'll find the North and the things and all this got involved with it all right went on the North country and set up a bigger thing than Michael had and he was kicked out of heaven he just simply pulled a group with him went over and he says now boys I'll read you in a minute where he said he didn't believe his boss and he says boys I I'm not trying to be anything don't you see that in the preachers of the message I'm not trying to that sickens me when a preacher he's paid to preach he comes in to preach he's assigned to preach and what's the first thing he said I I'm just the least one among you but it just fa my lot to preach well why don't you shut up let somebody else do it amen if you're that good he ain't meaning that to no he's wanting to get you in his pocket want to get you with him and this well he's so sweet now you think the devil he went you think the devil he went around there you know and he went up this Ang said now let me take you you going to believe me I'm the guy in charge I'm just you see where I stand don't you I stand beside the Lord now I don't think the devil is not that dumb you might think so but I don't he's very very deceiving he tried to get them to see his Doctrine his denomination okay message called why preached in 1965 309 paragraph E34 he said talking about heart trouble is not the number one heart and I said heart trouble's not the number one sin trouble now listen to it and what is sin sin is not not smoking cigarettes sin is not committing adultery sin is not drinking swearing that's the attributes of sin there's only one sin that's unbelief any man if he lives as holy and Pious and as good as he could be and yet say it say that the days of Miracles is passed and deny the scripture saying Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and day forever that man is a sinner cuz he's an unbeliever right good definition don't matter how holy and P now how many of us and I don't like to don't raise your hand I just asked a question how many of us back before we heard of this message believe that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today for oh we quoted it yeah we read it we got to GH St we read that scripture but did we believe it the Antichrist John tells you what it is any spirit that denies that Jesus Christ is present tense come in the flesh is Antichrist if you don't believe Jesus Christ is now standing in people of this day you do you are an unbeliever that's right trying to get you to see how simple simple sin to disbelief so Satan as I said he just goes among the crowd and now listen let's get down to where we at in the message there's not anybody the big guys in this message who will stand up and say I'll tell you what I'm I'm the guy in charge I'm the fell you're supposed to listen to now there may be one or two quacks cuz we always leave rounds and I can name a few if you want that said I can't preach erors and I can't do this and I'm in charge I'm to take over you know I'm while brother Brown's gone I'm the guy but 99% of the time is not that way is it right you know what it is it's the people I told a brother one time years ago I said brother I said your weakest people in your congregation is running you your babies are running you said what do you mean I said because they're trying to tell you that you are the son of man see he preached it to them from the pull pit but then they took it back to him brother you don't want to Pat you on the back yeah I like it I'm just human but brother that ain't no different than none of you now I proved that from the day I started here till Live today you walk in the boots I walk in you'll tell the people one thing for sure brother Dale don't make himself nothing because that's what I am is nothing I'm not trying to exalt him I even told and the brother got on to me just a year or so ago I used to press a gift I would press a gift and I knew a lot of things and I stopped doing that the brother rebuked me verbally in the office about it you're wrong I said no sir brother I said because I don't want nobody beli in this man here has got anything other than their brother their pastor they shepherd I said but I want the god that's within me to be able if I could press anything into you it's the god that's dwelling Within Me amen I want the gifts to work among you I want to see God in your life I want to hear sister Gil what you got to say about God right right and don't worry about your stuttering or Stam you know well I can't get it in words you don't worry about that can't none of us get it in words see I'm trying my best to get you to see God my goal in life is to get this congregation right here to see Jesus Christ into her own life as a personal experience I don't care if I miss it I sett it that a long time ago said God if it's necessary you just destroy this vessel would you get them people to see you that's not coffee and bread around this that's trying to tell you the God's on his truth right I've seen a many of things but I hold back to tell you sometime because I don't want you to build on it I want you to build on Jesus Christ in your life amen as your own personal experience cuz I know what sin is was told me here some said you're a prophet I came right to this pull pit and rebuked it I said I am not a prophet but I said you don't realize if you make me a prophet you don't realize what you're doing that means I've got to resign as Pastor cuz I can't be in both offices well you're a teacher I didn't say I was you did go ahead I don't know what I am I'm just in the body of Christ is having me a wonderful time talking about what I see about God but now what is sin just for me it's for you to just even have one for us to have one thought that Jesus Christ is not the same now if this hurts feelings I'm sorry but for the people of the message what are they now we could we could see God back in brother brand and wonderful but we just don't see him no more we show me where you're supposed to be able to see him anymore like that if you're supposed to see him anymore like that you're supposed to find you another Prophet right sful you see when I just don't see God Open Your Eyes Open Your Eyes look around right and see God in the people amen and see at least a group of people that's trying to understand what a prophet had to say right cuz I believe that's the only thing that's going to change us is what what we're in within us amen and see I've never said what people thinks about me I've had a lot of people to question me about things I've never but have made it public there's going to be a resurrection one of these days and there's going to be about 30 40 days according to the Bible according to the prophet well why can't brother rown come back and preach to US during that time right that's all I've ever believed and all I've ever said see then I don't deny the tent Vision I just maybe don't see like you see cuz I see him in the grave right waiting on you and I amen yes sir that's the only thing that I say to anybody cuz the Bible said they without us cannot be made perfect now I'm in the scriptures and I don't worry but he can preach to us for 30 40 days he can do whatever he wants to we're not I guess you think when we ra when the dead raised and they walk in Among Us find those pictures of downstairs you know all people and they walk in among us and we say hey who R call you know I saw I I I saw Ruth he said what I did do do you know well well let's go hunting yeah you let's go get something to eat no I don't think it'll prob be that away all right you can if you want to but I don't think I think it's going to be 30 40 days of the hardest rejoicing that's ever been and it'll be serviced every night every day all day and it won't be going home come why are we worried 30 40 days why are we worried most of us has got enough fat to life to few right that's right and by then you're going to keep putting your money in the bank you know 30 40 days you going to keep putting your money in the bank huh you going realize about that time they going to do you no good I'm looking for a great glorious time when the resurrection transpires but you know why it's going to take place because sin is gone right sin is gone you find a couple to give you an idea brother Joe run over to number 11 on the notes which is E17 uh the Seal of the Antichrist 1955 311 I give them a number on the side of the page some where they can help real quick if he can't find it he get it there quick as I start reading and all of us know that he was the Antichrist he worked a very closest hand to Christ now who's he talking about you talking about Judas number one CU he's the closest to Christ he was the secretary treasure that's right right that's right but look what it goes on his right-and man did you know that in heaven that the devil was God's right- hand man in the beginning that Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that God God had created and perverted back into an evil thing which started all this trouble in the beginning then God back before the foundation of the world was ever laid when he seen what Satan done in his pride pride is't that what the scripture said Pride goes before fall what is pride you know what amazed me I mean I remember the day I first read it what was those seven demons that was cast out of Mary Magdalene oh anybody tell what it is it was lust it was desires it was all kind of things you haven't read the message brother Rand said it was Pride I'll get to these when if we get back to it he called them demons not one of them did he call any lust whatsoever that was in Mary Magdalene it was Pride boastful beautiful right see we think it was all kind of yeah CU we seen too many movies we've been in life too long right do we think we know what was wrong with Mary now if I miss this was it right now and if it is I'll tell you if it ain't I'll bring it back to you that one of those in there brother Brandon said that she thought saw the religious world and how wrong it was and said she turned to the street of prostitution be glad to find that one but you already to see it's right she saw the religion and how that it wouldn't worth nothing we laugh at the you know but look at a group of people over there that those Pharisees all of their life they spend their life serving a God that to them no longer exist yet they're willing to fight the the world over him but right on the other side of the street is the Hindu Muslim if I get all that wrong you put it in the right one okay and they every day one hour they get down and crawl on the ground and they pray I saw it the magazine one time for us to pray in school and lock you up right right in New York they have been having prayers I don't really know how long but those people get down and block the streets and pray for hours they don't lock them up right so it goes to show who's going to be in command one of these days but what are you talking about I'm talking but don't call it sincerity they have a month that they don't need certain things they have a month of fasting they have a month they have this that and what do we have you said we don't have to do that stuff to be Christians you don't have to act like the devil and try to claim you one either right amen right I don't look down on those people I've been to the mosque you know what I do take my shoes off why they told me I got to take my shoes off I'll take my shoes off I honor them but one of these days this will be tried and you wait and see there'll be one walk in that door back there that'll have a turban on his head and we'll ask him to remove it and then we'll be in jail CU he will not remove it but I will stand in his face and tell him Mister I've been to your mosque I take my shoes off in respect you take that off in respect or leave and I'll be in jail you know it's true cuz it's not far us anymore right I'm tried to tell you even just one simple thing come on musicians you're going home today stop at the service station and buy some gas now all belong to some people go to motel before you get home all of them belongs to certain groups of people what's going to happen when they refuse to sell you gasoline and all they want you to do is just say recognize us as being a religious belief that's all there was in heaven Satan was saying just recognize us now Lord don't we worship more than these others he never has stopped worshiping God see we think of the guy with the horns and the red suit he never been that brother R said he's a Slicker in the P pit right so you better know who's in the pit but think on these things what is sin just think about that to Wednesday and we'll get the rest of these quotes out to where Satan got jealous he said he didn't like his boss jealousy Pride beautiful his anointing is in the the uh Stones beautiful we study a little bit about Satan till we get back but just think about unbelief you said I believe everything brother Ram said but one thing that makes us a sinner no no me brother I don't understand well why did you say you didn't believe it why did you just say you didn't understand it think you say I don't understand it I told you about the Daniel 70 weeks AG we should see my book years ago ever right on the side of the page I had a question question question question question cuz I didn't know what he's talking about and I kept reading and praying and studying I'd go back and sometimes I'd be able to take one of those question marks off I would never preach any message on Daniel 70 weeks until ever question mark was erased I spend more time trying to turn down my sermon a lot of times than I do in trying to build it why because I don't want it to be an unbelief and I realize that just one word planted into your heart in the wrong way will bring out a seed of unbelief thinkk on these things go ahead let's turn number 61 in the red book we just sang a verse we go into the all right so they got everything ready mybody have holy on Jesus on theist in other ground is sing s all other ground about it anybody have theunion we don't want any problem s all s all around my so way is all my all all around him when he shall come with all s all amen let's just go on into the communion you don't follow along in the scriptures being 1 Corinthians 11:23 cuz everything is provided and ready for us for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which he excuse me which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he broke it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had St saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh down to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come take on these things sister Gail yes do you have the little bottle of rub on your hands you have in your pocketbook I think so if not I'll rot some oil on my hand and break the bread because I've been coughing and holding my hand over my mouth and I don't want anybody else to think any problems have any troubles to wor that they would think it would be anything wrong who got it sister Regina you got some all right and we'll do it I need to put me a little bottle up here to where we can do it cuz I don't want to hinder nobody's believing or are thinking I don't fragance this is a free one H fragrance oh I might do my hands more often man I'm not I'm throwing off on nobody now I understand everybody's human and some people they just don't want to they think and they be standing there thinking well he broke that bread see the devil's on your shoulders he broke that bread and he's done been coughing all over his hands and things but uh so we just put that to rest but the Bible said that they tied for a moment so let's just pray one for another that God would bless us bless each one Lord we commit everything into your hands in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and he blessed it father this bread was made for the purpose today for this time and we accept it as coming from you and you gave it to us we ask you now that you'd sanctify it and Lord we know that it's just a symbol yet it still has a lot of meaning to that symbol so we ask you to just sanctify the bread and the partakers that we may be one together in Jesus name it was the broken body that was broken for each one of us there not a round wer you know not a soda cracker wouldn't made for that made dedicated to where that it would be right in the symbols you know seeing people healed by taking it so they he healing virtues and whatever our mind and our thinking about the the things of life but you see back there in the Old Testament they couldn't understand it but as Wade was bringing out one time they had a special little place there they never could understand what was going on but when it come forth then that's what Jesus Took the bread you know and done what he done with it it wasn't just something that was new it already a part of their ways and Customs but it had never been understood as to what it was until he came along and instituted it father we thank you for this wine that's been made for this purpose and we believe that it's the type of your spirit of the Living God that dwells with each and every one of us and as we eat the bread and the example and then we drank this little piece of we eat the little piece of bread and we drank this little bit of wine to tomorrow it will be blood cells in our body helping us to live Lord we thank you for that we ask you to sanctify the wine and the partakers in Jesus name amen come morning I by the river I'll rest kn the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight Come Morning Glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how then I take one more look at Mount calary and it gives me the strength to go on why come morning some morning between 600 and 9:00 River something's going happen and brother Richard talking about it this morning I don't believe we're going out of here with Lambs missing and things I don't believe we're going out of here in sick bodies you know Sister Trudy we're talking about last night talking about her eyesight I said what if God changes it right here and Chang the rest of your body in one Split Second after then what has it got to do with it that's right it could be standing there with an arm missing and it be restored all at once and then gone but you know what I look for it to be done before then I believe it can be done now I believe your eyesight can be healed just now you say what's keeping it from being healed I believe sometime God just wants to see if we believe and he just holds off a little bit Let's us run our course and get through and then he just simply comes down yes and just takes care of things cuz he's a wonderful God you see we're trying to make it work we're trying to make it in some way you know that God has to come and uh do it he don't have to do nothing he's God right he in no form has to do anything you remember brother randam got in trouble because he said God you owe me he said he let me pout it out for about 3 months now that's a prophet he said he let me pout it out about 3 months then he come to me and explained it to me but you see we think we're so something
