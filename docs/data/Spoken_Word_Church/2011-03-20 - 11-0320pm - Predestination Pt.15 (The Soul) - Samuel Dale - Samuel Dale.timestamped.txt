[34:05] Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and
[34:09] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[34:11] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[34:12] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[34:15] as he has chosen Us in him before the
[34:17] foundation of the world that we should
[34:19] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[34:21] love having predestinated us unto the
[34:24] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[34:26] himself
[34:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[34:29] will to the praise of the glory of his
[34:32] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[34:34] in Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[34:37] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[34:39] sins according to the riches of his
[34:42] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[34:45] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[34:47] known unto us the mystery of his will
[34:50] according to his good pleasure which he
[34:52] hath purposed in himself that in the
[34:55] dispensation of the fullness of time
[34:56] times he might gather together in one
[34:59] all things in Christ both which are in
[35:01] heaven and which are on earth even in
[35:04] him in whom also we have obtained an
[35:06] inheritance being predestinated
[35:09] according to the purpose of him who
[35:11] worketh all things after the counsel of
[35:13] his own will that we should be to the
[35:16] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[35:20] Christ now let's go to
[35:22] Ezekiel just one verse there Ezekiel
[35:25] 18:4
[35:31] behold All Souls are
[35:36] mine as the soul of the
[35:38] father so also the soul of the son is
[35:43] mine the soul that
[35:46] sinth it shall die you may be seated to
[35:49] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[35:51] of the
[35:53] word now as I said we may be a little
[35:56] lengthy I'll try not to
[35:58] be
[35:59] but I want to get what I have on my mind
[36:03] off and get it
[36:07] into unto you as to what I
[36:11] believe and uh and in that we can go
[36:15] from there and
[36:17] uh I know I realize that this is a bad
[36:20] day and a bad time upon the Earth but
[36:23] why should we be
[36:24] worried uh you know
[36:27] uh I think it's the greatest time that's
[36:29] ever
[36:30] been I think this is the end of all
[36:33] things the scripture said it's come upon
[36:36] us and I believe it and I believe that
[36:39] you know we're here we're here for a
[36:41] purpose right and I don't believe
[36:43] anybody can take your place I believe
[36:46] you're right here for where you're
[36:47] supposed to be and everything is right
[36:49] on time all right and you know that we
[36:54] have to be ready against that day and
[36:58] have to be uh you know no matter what
[37:01] comes or goes that we just put it into
[37:04] the hands of the Lord and trust him and
[37:07] uh you know and believe it and walk
[37:10] forward in the Lord all right
[37:13] now not to back up much but to just to
[37:16] just say a few words about this
[37:18] morning's message see we were talking
[37:20] about how that when the morning star
[37:23] sang together and the sons of God
[37:25] shouted for joy
[37:27] that the prophet of God said that that
[37:29] was when the Plan of Redemption come
[37:31] into view well then he says that you
[37:35] know could that be when the the lamb was
[37:38] slain well and I hope you was listening
[37:41] and I won't say much about it but you
[37:43] know
[37:46] uh to me then if you try to to uh go too
[37:51] far
[37:53] back you're going to redeem yourself out
[37:56] of exist
[37:57] existance you know because it that way
[38:00] you can uh you can only handle it so far
[38:04] and then you you will have a problem and
[38:07] uh then if we try to go that way too far
[38:10] and go out of the the part of eternal
[38:14] life and keep in our hearts and our
[38:16] minds the thoughts of here we are and
[38:20] what we've been and what God has done
[38:23] for us then I believe we would would be
[38:26] going wrong there but see I know that in
[38:30] preaching and trying to explain to
[38:33] you that people will you know ridicule
[38:37] you for making statements and things you
[38:40] know and and they'll just say well we
[38:43] just we're just simple and we just you
[38:45] know we want to remain simple and we
[38:48] just believe everything the prophet said
[38:50] you know and all like that well that's
[38:53] well and good but um bring what the
[38:57] prophet has said and let's
[38:59] see you know because I've tried to bring
[39:01] to you all that I can about what the
[39:03] prophet has said you know the uh the
[39:06] quotes the things I I try to give them
[39:08] to you to see that's the reason I run
[39:11] them off and you know uh doing 8 and 10
[39:14] pages of notes to try to get you to see
[39:17] at least well this is what the prophet
[39:19] had to say you know and and continue
[39:22] their own and say well you're just
[39:24] twisting it well uh it's all right just
[39:28] go ahead and do what you want to I I'm
[39:30] just going to continue on down through
[39:33] going on and when we walk off this Earth
[39:36] then uh we'll see what was right and
[39:38] wrong you know when it's all finished
[39:41] and uh you know I I'm just trying to be
[39:44] to explain to you what I believe amen
[39:49] because as I've kept saying to you that
[39:53] if you take all of the quotes and just
[39:55] use them for what ever you want them to
[39:57] be used then you can make brother
[39:59] brandom say anything you want
[40:02] to you say well we always was eternal
[40:05] well like right we've expressed that
[40:07] over and over I believe that I believe
[40:09] the eternal life that you have that's
[40:11] right by the new birth always was
[40:15] eternal see but I believe there was a
[40:17] time we was
[40:19] not Eternal right because of the Fallen
[40:23] condition what would be the fall and as
[40:25] I keep saying then you know if you
[40:27] always was eternal then there's no way
[40:29] to redeem there there's nothing to
[40:32] redeem you know that that's you know
[40:35] that's sensible to me but maybe it's not
[40:38] to everybody else but I that's just the
[40:39] way I think but you know I I try to
[40:43] bring it the best that I can and I
[40:46] believe that when you we started the
[40:49] going backward as I said you must be
[40:51] able to go backward as far as you can go
[40:53] forward in
[40:54] predestination and and to be able to see
[40:57] you know and uh I hope you caught where
[41:00] I ended it up this morning and I tried
[41:02] to this past Wednesday but really
[41:04] nailing it down this morning that when
[41:07] Jesus Christ stood
[41:09] there as the Creator
[41:12] God you know and begin to create that he
[41:16] was standing there and the prophet
[41:18] called it who is this melz a word formed
[41:21] body an IM morphe body all right we
[41:24] bypassed coming in in that imorph body
[41:28] yes because we there would have been no
[41:31] fall there was no way that Jesus could
[41:34] fall
[41:35] right there was no way see we had to be
[41:38] brought down into a condition to where
[41:42] that we could fall and given the
[41:44] opportunity and we did but the now not
[41:48] Jesus the flesh man back thereus where
[41:50] everybody gets me messed up because see
[41:52] when I say Jesus I'm not talking about
[41:54] the flesh that walked upon the shord of
[41:56] Galilee I'm talking about the God of
[41:59] Heaven because Jesus is his name right
[42:02] why can't I talk about him as being
[42:04] almighty God that's his name his name is
[42:06] Jesus he never had another name but see
[42:09] then I try to say Jesus Christ where
[42:11] you'll relate to it but see as he stood
[42:13] there then we can only be redeemed back
[42:16] as far as he was standing
[42:21] there and as he was standing there the
[42:23] great Eternal Loos theop El himself self
[42:26] existing God dwelling in a form word
[42:31] body
[42:33] theophany all right if we wasn't in him
[42:37] we will never be in him all right then
[42:40] he was a one word
[42:42] oneform body
[42:45] right then if we were in him then we
[42:49] would be
[42:50] what we would be the members of his body
[42:55] amen see part of
[42:58] him see and that way then that eternal
[43:03] life is him well then I thought we
[43:06] believe by coming here in a fallen
[43:10] condition that we by the new birth right
[43:14] would become a many membered body that's
[43:17] right but it's only one body there's
[43:19] only one David couldn't have he had a
[43:22] thousand wives but they couldn't have
[43:24] but one husband so really David didn't
[43:26] have one wife it was just a thousand
[43:29] members of it right all right Jesus
[43:32] Christ has got one
[43:34] body and we're members in particular to
[43:37] make up that body so we're just a
[43:39] display on
[43:41] Earth of that body that was back there
[43:45] right eternal life not these bodies get
[43:48] these things out of the way they're
[43:50] garbage right and look back into reality
[43:55] and and see see what's going on get away
[43:58] from your great wonderful Revelations
[44:00] you
[44:02] think get down to reality of just
[44:05] believing
[44:07] God right see then there was a great
[44:10] celebration in heaven we ended up by
[44:12] saying that what right when the morning
[44:16] stars and the sons of God saw the Plan
[44:19] of Redemption our Jesus Christ
[44:22] Revelations 18 138 to be slain before
[44:25] the foundation of the world and the Plan
[44:27] of Redemption would come into
[44:29] view then I hope you was listening to
[44:32] what I was saying see when we were there
[44:35] in him we then could know and understand
[44:41] what was going to take
[44:43] place that we were going to come into a
[44:46] condition upon
[44:47] Earth now see you know and as it did
[44:51] then that we would come to a place to
[44:53] receive eternal life and that would be
[44:56] God's Plan of Redemption and your soul
[44:59] by the new birth is just as Eternal as
[45:01] it'll ever be that's right your body was
[45:04] laying in the world we covered M right
[45:08] if not where did it come from the
[45:09] prophet said amen see then by laying in
[45:12] the world then it has to be brought to a
[45:15] place right Amen to where it can be made
[45:18] Eternal all right now what did your
[45:20] Prophet
[45:24] say I'm trying to think I think it's is
[45:26] it future home where he says that
[45:30] talking about Jesus at the River Jordan
[45:32] he said from that part of the earth that
[45:36] I've redeemed yeah that's right said
[45:39] I'll redeem the rest of it that's right
[45:41] man so then our bodies have a capability
[45:45] of being redeemed right am why because
[45:47] they come out of the earth and Jesus
[45:49] Christ come from this Earth not as the
[45:52] nasty sinful 16 elements but from the
[45:55] original word that created it that's
[45:57] right all right now but we'll get on to
[46:00] those things and cover some more things
[46:02] later but see then would it be a hard
[46:05] problem to look at it and really see
[46:07] that you know a fall was going to come
[46:11] because right that was the only way God
[46:14] could display his attributes was for a
[46:17] fallen condition now he couldn't make
[46:19] the condition be there right and then
[46:22] condemn us for being wrong that's right
[46:24] but he knew if he made us and gave us a
[46:26] choice look at Adam and Eve in the
[46:29] garden look at the wonderful position
[46:31] whatever you want to think about Eve
[46:33] look at the wonderful position that the
[46:35] woman was in right amen and yet through
[46:39] her
[46:41] thinking to her Desiring not
[46:45] necessarily sexual things her Desiring
[46:50] to know more about
[46:52] God caused her to fall into a condition
[46:56] yeah and take us with it
[46:58] right see then that's where we can stand
[47:01] all right now let's get on and I I don't
[47:03] want to try not too much time but I just
[47:06] want to make sure we cover some little
[47:08] things and then just step on over
[47:09] another step into what we're
[47:12] understanding but now remember anybody
[47:14] listening to this tape and you remember
[47:18] there is just one God that's right
[47:21] that's right there's never been two
[47:23] three 5 seven how many whatever there's
[47:26] never been but one true and living God
[47:28] Amen that word that we're talking about
[47:31] was God in another form am called the
[47:34] word when he was walking the shores of
[47:36] Galilee the Bible said in him dwelt the
[47:39] fullness of the godhead bodily all right
[47:42] then if we was back there in him now
[47:45] listen when he created the world then
[47:48] would it be any problem for the prophet
[47:50] to say that we was in him when he walked
[47:52] the shores of Galilee that's right amen
[47:54] now what was in him
[47:58] when he walked the shores of Galilee
[48:00] eternal life that's
[48:03] right eternal life amen and the full
[48:06] word of God so then we could be able to
[48:09] come forth in our designated decree time
[48:12] psalms about
[48:14] 139 see all right and then we could come
[48:17] forth as to be the bride of Christ right
[48:20] the many membered body that's right of
[48:24] the Lord Jesus Christ each member having
[48:27] eternal
[48:30] life because that's where we fell from M
[48:35] right I'll get to that in a minute you
[48:37] say we fail from eternal
[48:39] life what your Prophet had to say so you
[48:41] better
[48:43] listen but you be careful how you fall
[48:45] right that's right don't make eternal
[48:48] life fall
[48:51] right so you better stay awake this
[48:53] afternoon and if it takes me I would
[48:55] sorry I I try to finish as quick as I
[48:58] can but I don't want to get sufficed
[49:00] that I I get my mind going and I get
[49:02] ahead and my wife says you quote a lot
[49:04] of things wrong well you just put it in
[49:06] the right place I'm sorry I just do the
[49:08] best I can of trying to to preach the
[49:11] gospel all right now you just look down
[49:13] on your notes we follow along and we
[49:15] just kind of pick up things and we go
[49:18] and then we'll try to get a better
[49:20] understanding all right now if we wasn't
[49:23] a part of God
[49:26] talking about eternal life we never will
[49:29] be that's right all right that's right
[49:33] now so when he walked the shores of
[49:35] Galilee if we wasn't in him we never
[49:36] will be in him that's why he had to die
[49:39] to release
[49:41] that yep he had bottled up in him what
[49:45] we had need of that's why there was no
[49:48] people in the Old Testament could
[49:50] receive the new birth right there was no
[49:54] way
[49:57] sure they got eternal life on the basis
[50:00] of a
[50:01] promise but they're called the Servants
[50:04] of God right they're not called the sons
[50:08] and
[50:08] daughters but see that's who we are we
[50:11] are his children we're his offspring so
[50:14] watch what we're saying now and you just
[50:15] grab it as we try to go down
[50:19] identifications 1964 brother R says
[50:23] you are part of
[50:28] God and Jesus came to redeem those that
[50:31] was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[50:33] before the foundation of the world it
[50:35] was in God's
[50:37] thoughts that's what he come to redeem
[50:40] he said then as soon as it strikes to
[50:43] them they see it because the life is in
[50:47] there representation from predestination
[50:50] that's right but like I said now and
[50:52] that's where people listen they won't
[50:54] pay attention to what you're you're
[50:55] saying they just make you say things you
[50:57] don't say the little woman at the
[51:01] well right that's right but in her
[51:04] sinful condition she believed God's word
[51:08] right all right but see brother rown
[51:11] said see that word Was Made
[51:16] Alive all right amen but you know that
[51:19] didn't give her the new birth that's
[51:21] right you know the Virgin Mary that gave
[51:24] birth to the word that received the word
[51:26] standing down there as a little young
[51:28] girl and said be it unto me according to
[51:30] Thy word y you know that never gave her
[51:33] the new bir you know brother around said
[51:35] you people believe the mother of God
[51:37] since she had to pull in the upper room
[51:38] and receive the baptism of the Holy
[51:40] Ghost that's right
[51:42] amen
[51:43] see because the word is quick unto you
[51:46] doesn't mean that it gives you the new
[51:48] birth that's right the disciples on the
[51:50] road to AAS you remember I preached it
[51:53] they the two that was on the road he
[51:54] opened her understand it then he comes
[51:57] back with them and appears to all of the
[52:00] disciples and opens their understanding
[52:02] of the word of him and time but that
[52:04] didn't give them the new birth they
[52:06] still had to go to the upper room that's
[52:09] right
[52:11] amen see you say well I've got it I I it
[52:14] was quickened to me this message has
[52:16] been quickened to me amen but did
[52:18] receive the Holy Ghost sent you believe
[52:21] that's what the Apostle Paul had to say
[52:22] about it is amen but see then do you see
[52:25] want to talk about you're going down to
[52:27] the next one God of this evil age WR
[52:28] around what and did you know you were in
[52:32] him if you are a Christian now you was
[52:35] in him then and then if that be so the
[52:39] whole godhead bodily shaped up in the
[52:41] person of Jesus Christ and when Jesus
[52:44] Christ died at the cross I died with him
[52:47] for I was in him then for he was the
[52:51] fullness of the word
[52:53] manifested now where is there anything
[52:56] there that is a
[52:59] mortal human being involved of you and
[53:04] I were we in him then you better be
[53:08] careful because you're going to have to
[53:09] have some way of getting us out of him
[53:12] if you're going to bring us
[53:14] mortal and then you're going to have
[53:15] trouble because you're going to have to
[53:17] have him having an intercourse with
[53:18] somebody to get it the the kids out of
[53:22] there he said well you shouldn't talk
[53:24] like that that's too brother there why
[53:26] not somebody need
[53:29] to it's time to stop playing little
[53:33] right you know things and believe God's
[53:35] word that's right you said but the
[53:37] children here they shouldn't hear it hey
[53:39] they hear a whole lot more at school
[53:40] than I'm just said so now you blame your
[53:43] teacher don't blame me I'm trying to
[53:45] preach the
[53:47] gospel don't don't worry about that part
[53:49] of see we were in him
[53:54] were what what was we in him yep a part
[53:58] of him that's
[54:00] right God's children are a part of him
[54:04] amen
[54:06] amen all right look the next one number
[54:09] four you read it what does it comes down
[54:11] talking about the self-existing one and
[54:13] all the things he said to be a
[54:16] father and in him were attributes to be
[54:19] a savior to be a father to be
[54:24] God to be a
[54:27] father now as I
[54:30] said if he had attributes in him to be a
[54:34] father that means he had children yeah
[54:39] if he had in him the the fact of being a
[54:42] Healer that would mean he would have to
[54:45] shed his
[54:46] blood why can't we believe it
[54:50] then Paul on the Mars Hill he's talking
[54:53] to him and he said the one you're
[54:55] talking about I'd like to explain to you
[54:57] but said let me tell you one thing said
[54:58] even your poets will say that we are The
[55:01] Offspring of
[55:03] God and Jesus wouldn't play and when he
[55:05] said they said you say you're God he
[55:08] said what are you talking about he
[55:10] said they're Gods to whom the word come
[55:12] to
[55:14] right J is referring basically to the
[55:17] prophets but who's the word come to now
[55:19] to the children of God that's right see
[55:22] going down to the next one marriage and
[55:24] divorce
[55:25] brother R said it was in him to be a
[55:29] father all right to be a father so then
[55:34] he had to have
[55:35] children is in him to be a father it was
[55:38] in him to be God it was in him to be a
[55:39] son it was in him to be a savior it was
[55:42] in him to be a Healer and all these
[55:43] things here are just displaying his
[55:45] attributes he said there's nothing that
[55:47] of
[55:49] order
[55:52] see all
[55:54] right
[55:56] now
[55:58] listen it was in him to be a father so
[56:01] that meant he had to have
[56:05] children now I've explained it over and
[56:09] over to you that that was God standing
[56:13] back there in a form called a
[56:17] son that's right now they didn't argue
[56:20] with him about saying he was a Son of
[56:23] God right
[56:26] right right they said you're a man
[56:28] making yourself God but they knew when
[56:31] he was saying that he was a Son of God
[56:33] are talking about the Sons and Daughters
[56:35] of God that they knew what he was saying
[56:39] that there's only one son of God and
[56:41] that's God
[56:45] himself and for us to receive eternal
[56:48] life makes us the children of God
[56:51] right called a son right but who are we
[56:56] God made manifest amen that's right
[56:59] Amen in a form called a son right and
[57:03] brother random said when you begin to
[57:05] say I and my father are one and these
[57:08] other things he said watch the Shu pull
[57:11] away right right now now where's the Shu
[57:15] the Shu ain't out there right shuck has
[57:18] got to get on here closer to us so when
[57:21] they start making fun of you for you
[57:22] saying that you're God made manifest in
[57:24] human flesh MH then you better believe
[57:27] one thing for sure they're Shu right and
[57:30] they'll pull away from you well because
[57:33] they they can't believe it see amen so
[57:35] watch now to be a father he must have
[57:40] children all right we are not the son of
[57:45] Jesus that was a Son of God
[57:51] right now brother R said Jesus
[57:55] now
[57:58] listen he didn't
[58:00] come to give you eternal
[58:05] life he come to pay the price right that
[58:10] you could be
[58:12] redeemed because eternal life would
[58:15] would have to be the father's
[58:17] life y you said well now but Jesus was
[58:21] almighty God
[58:23] right but we're not a child of Jesus
[58:26] that was a child of God to make you a
[58:28] grandchild right all right so we are the
[58:32] children of
[58:33] God because God is our
[58:36] father
[58:38] right so then in the spiritual condition
[58:41] of existence of taking about the New
[58:43] Birth then we must be God in another
[58:48] form and that way we can be called a
[58:53] son God the son is not another
[58:57] God cuz there's no such thing as God the
[59:00] son right that's right as a Son of God
[59:02] there's no such thing as God the son God
[59:04] the Father God the son God the Holy
[59:06] Ghost no such
[59:08] thing it can't exist
[59:11] right but God made
[59:14] manifest in another form right that way
[59:18] you're not trinitarian and you're not
[59:19] Oneness right look at number five on
[59:21] your notes you see he is God Express in
[59:25] human form called the Son of
[59:28] God which the son was the mass that's
[59:31] trying to do God a service
[59:35] 1965 the son is the
[59:39] mask he said and if that don't make our
[59:42] message exactly right identified by the
[59:45] scripture to what he was trying to
[59:47] preach right
[59:49] right look on
[59:53] down look at the D
[59:56] ification preach in
[1:00:00] 1963 see why some man will say that he's
[1:00:02] no more than a
[1:00:03] teacher he's a philosopher he's a good
[1:00:06] man or a prophet he was Emmanuel he was
[1:00:10] the son of
[1:00:11] God listen which is God made manifest in
[1:00:16] his
[1:00:17] attributes of displaying himself in a
[1:00:21] body that he built himself right so the
[1:00:24] Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of
[1:00:26] the godhead bodily right you know the
[1:00:28] brother around said the godhead not
[1:00:30] complete without you come on you know
[1:00:33] that you know why because you're part of
[1:00:35] God Amen so everybody follow me being a
[1:00:38] part of God
[1:00:40] yes then being a part of God where God
[1:00:43] May manifest in another form called the
[1:00:44] children of God all right so now we just
[1:00:47] got a couple little quotes to throw in
[1:00:49] him Mighty God unveiled brother around
[1:00:52] I'm talking about and God in the
[1:00:53] beginning was life the Eternal one in
[1:00:55] him was attributes and those attributes
[1:00:57] became words and the word became flesh
[1:01:00] Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem
[1:01:03] means to bring back and if he has to
[1:01:05] bring it back it had to be somewhere to
[1:01:08] be brought back too so you see all
[1:01:11] people will never be able to see it
[1:01:13] because all people wasn't in the
[1:01:15] beginning in God's
[1:01:18] thoughts now that's as blun as can be
[1:01:22] said right right prove it his word
[1:01:26] 1964 see the righteous does not die
[1:01:30] talking about the little Maiden said she
[1:01:31] was asleep Jesus came to redeem the
[1:01:34] righteous and to redeem means to be
[1:01:36] brought back from where you once was see
[1:01:40] he could not redeem the unbelievers no
[1:01:42] matter how educated and how much doctors
[1:01:44] of divinity they had he could not redeem
[1:01:47] them because they were not redeemable
[1:01:50] they had to go to their destination
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:56] message who M ches 1965 God vindicates
[1:02:00] that that's always been right God
[1:02:02] vindicates it to be true so plainly the
[1:02:05] redent shows plainly the
[1:02:07] predestinated is the only one that's
[1:02:10] considered in Redemption did you get it
[1:02:12] let me say that again the predestinated
[1:02:15] is the only one that is considered in
[1:02:16] Redemption people might be making like
[1:02:20] think they are but the real Redemption
[1:02:22] is those that are predestination
[1:02:25] because the very word redeem means to
[1:02:27] bring back is that right to redeem is
[1:02:30] something to redeem anything is to bring
[1:02:32] it back to its original Place hallelujah
[1:02:35] it's only the predestinated will be
[1:02:37] brought back
[1:02:39] because because the others don't come
[1:02:41] from there see bring back all right so
[1:02:46] everybody can't be redeemed
[1:02:50] why cuz it was not in that one that was
[1:02:52] standing back there
[1:02:55] they were not a part of that one that
[1:02:56] was standing back there that created the
[1:02:58] world of the full
[1:03:01] word they wasn't by not being there
[1:03:03] there wasn't in Jesus when he walked as
[1:03:05] shores of Galilee so what was in Jesus
[1:03:08] that walked ashore of
[1:03:10] Galilee he was the Living
[1:03:12] Word the alive word he said my words are
[1:03:17] spirit and their
[1:03:20] life he was the word made
[1:03:23] flesh
[1:03:25] all
[1:03:25] right and in him dwelt the fullness of
[1:03:28] the godhead B that's right all right
[1:03:33] now we saw this morning that when the
[1:03:35] lamb was
[1:03:39] slain then those that were in him saw
[1:03:43] the Plan of
[1:03:48] Redemption knew it was going to take
[1:03:52] place and could rejoice
[1:03:55] you said well brother Dale we were only
[1:03:57] in his
[1:03:58] thinking amen so then we were only in
[1:04:01] his thinking and then to say we saw the
[1:04:04] lamb as it was slain then it means that
[1:04:08] we were there in some form to be able to
[1:04:11] see
[1:04:14] it if you rejoiced what was you
[1:04:17] rejoicing about right and if you was
[1:04:19] rejoicing or shouting then you had to be
[1:04:22] there in some form what was the form was
[1:04:25] in oh was the little dots can't you just
[1:04:28] see it there's little dots here and
[1:04:29] there little dots there and put that's
[1:04:31] the way the people do it you know what
[1:04:33] little dots do well there's this seed
[1:04:35] here and there's this seed there and
[1:04:37] put he was in Jesus Christ right cuz
[1:04:40] only the word becomes predestinated
[1:04:42] eternally or
[1:04:46] seed then would any problem for God to
[1:04:49] be able to look down through time and
[1:04:50] see how many people would receive
[1:04:52] eternal life
[1:04:57] you know that as far as he was concerned
[1:04:59] this thing was over with before the
[1:05:00] world ever started that's right that's
[1:05:02] what kept him now I've asked the
[1:05:04] question and I know see if I get slow
[1:05:05] I'm sorry cuz he's come to me and I have
[1:05:07] to explain it or it'll it'll take away
[1:05:09] somewhere else that's what happened in
[1:05:12] the
[1:05:15] garden in the garden when man
[1:05:18] sinned why did God not destroy
[1:05:23] him oh I know the great
[1:05:26] story
[1:05:27] yes the way that Eve was kept from being
[1:05:30] destroyed was that Adam grabbed her and
[1:05:32] had a intercourse with her now bud
[1:05:35] that's that's worth in 10th Street worse
[1:05:38] than 10th Street down Atlanta right
[1:05:40] brother
[1:05:42] Gary you know what 10th Street was the
[1:05:44] old hippie District they just lived in
[1:05:47] garbage you know that's worse than
[1:05:51] that but see what kept Adam from being
[1:05:54] destroyed come on cuz he was the one
[1:05:56] that done the wrong right because Jesus
[1:05:58] Christ stood as a lamb slain before the
[1:06:00] foundation world you said yeah but what
[1:06:02] God done he killed them animals amen I'm
[1:06:04] glad you're thinking but what took care
[1:06:05] of Adam and them two seconds one second
[1:06:08] whatever it was between the time they
[1:06:10] sinned until God put the animal skin on
[1:06:13] them what took care of them
[1:06:16] right one Split Second in the eyes of
[1:06:19] God and we all be destroyed without a
[1:06:21] lamb amen what was it
[1:06:25] because God was looking right back to
[1:06:26] see that he done paid the price am
[1:06:30] that's right right he done stood as a
[1:06:32] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:06:34] world and the predestinated had to come
[1:06:37] forth so where is it
[1:06:39] now then what form our thought can we
[1:06:42] see that would enable us to see what the
[1:06:46] word redeem would actually
[1:06:49] mean how could we be
[1:06:52] something that can be red
[1:06:56] redeemed remember redeemed goes to back
[1:06:59] to where you came from all we covered
[1:07:03] those all
[1:07:05] right he said well where did you fall
[1:07:07] from all right now let's read what
[1:07:09] brother R let to say look at number 10
[1:07:10] on your
[1:07:15] notes this is taken from the breach the
[1:07:18] church the seal book 1963 317 the
[1:07:21] evening message called the breach
[1:07:28] page 81 amen when a person is struck
[1:07:31] with disease aches and pain one time
[1:07:34] they wasn't that way they were grown but
[1:07:36] they're groaning why they're not right
[1:07:39] there's something wrong and they're
[1:07:40] groaning and trying to get back to where
[1:07:43] they was when they had help and when
[1:07:46] Nature and people as the Bible said are
[1:07:49] groaning it shows there's something that
[1:07:51] they're not in their right their they
[1:07:53] ought to to be conditioned they have
[1:07:56] fallen from
[1:07:57] somewhere I'm reading number 10 on the
[1:08:02] notes well no it's maybe nine listed on
[1:08:05] yours cuz I had to change mine go down
[1:08:07] to 10 you know where it's at right below
[1:08:09] there go down to read on the
[1:08:12] breach I had to change these because me
[1:08:14] and Jo even got messed up on what
[1:08:16] message I was preaching he had me down
[1:08:18] as preaching the 15th and this evening I
[1:08:20] had it down as the 13th and so you know
[1:08:23] I I am human but you are you with me now
[1:08:25] have you found the breach got it it's
[1:08:27] right in the middle number nine should
[1:08:30] be number nine right okay so if I get my
[1:08:32] numbers off you read the next number
[1:08:34] down below all right but what is he
[1:08:36] saying now watch what he had to say
[1:08:38] about it he said they fallen from
[1:08:41] somewhere all right now this
[1:08:45] listen this is not just Adam and
[1:08:48] Eve right right all
[1:08:52] right that's what people make it to be
[1:08:56] no it's not Adam and Eve it's all
[1:08:57] mankind right all right we don't need
[1:09:00] anybody to interpret that for us see for
[1:09:04] of course we know it was eternal
[1:09:07] life they had fallen
[1:09:09] from and they lost their claims on
[1:09:12] eternal life by the fall of Adam and
[1:09:16] Eve who fell from eternal life to death
[1:09:19] in the Garden of Eden and brought all
[1:09:21] nature under them to death right
[1:09:27] he said we're born on the other side
[1:09:29] sold out he said of course when Adam
[1:09:31] fell to death he brought death upon all
[1:09:34] creation all right
[1:09:38] now here's a prophet making a statement
[1:09:41] and we're going to make some statements
[1:09:42] down below here that will will seemingly
[1:09:46] be total
[1:09:48] contradictory because God cannot give
[1:09:50] you eternal life and take it back that's
[1:09:53] right right he's not an Indian giver
[1:09:55] right so now what's the prophet
[1:10:00] saying well that's said interpretation
[1:10:03] now brother Dale well let's hear what
[1:10:04] you got to say about
[1:10:08] it I told you I'll tell you what I
[1:10:11] believe so then you can do what you want
[1:10:12] to about
[1:10:14] it how can you fall from eternal
[1:10:18] life so now what's brother brownon
[1:10:20] saying
[1:10:22] m
[1:10:28] what is he
[1:10:29] saying go on down the next message hear
[1:10:32] you him said but if God Saves you
[1:10:35] knowing he's going to lose you he
[1:10:36] defeats his
[1:10:38] purpose he don't do that when he saves
[1:10:42] you you're saved he that Hearth my words
[1:10:44] and believeth on him that sent me ha
[1:10:45] everlasting life and never come into was
[1:10:48] passion death into
[1:10:50] life turn
[1:10:52] over to the questions and answers
[1:10:57] 61 he talking about he was a prophet he
[1:11:00] had you know but God saved him and God's
[1:11:02] not an ending Giver as we call it he
[1:11:06] don't well if God give you the Holy
[1:11:08] Ghost knowing that he's going to lose
[1:11:11] you right down here why what a foolish
[1:11:14] thing it would be for him to give you
[1:11:16] the holy ghost in the first place
[1:11:22] right
[1:11:24] look at the next
[1:11:29] one 1956 god making his promise that
[1:11:33] it's a gift of God eternal life now that
[1:11:36] is if Christ has received you and if
[1:11:39] Christ gives you eternal life here and
[1:11:41] lost you down here and him being
[1:11:44] infinite knowing all things he defeats
[1:11:47] his own work he saved you when he saved
[1:11:50] you when he know he was going to lose
[1:11:53] you CU he so he doesn't do it like
[1:11:59] that now course now we got the great
[1:12:03] answer brother Dale all of those was
[1:12:06] before the seals was
[1:12:12] preached you know I like to put it out
[1:12:14] like that you know
[1:12:15] why cuz if I'm going to be a Great
[1:12:17] Deceiver I'll be a good one
[1:12:20] amen but if I can't preach both sides of
[1:12:23] the fence I tell you what you're already
[1:12:24] deceived
[1:12:26] anyway amen and there already no two
[1:12:29] sides of the fence to this message
[1:12:30] that's right it's one
[1:12:32] message all right brother Brandon what
[1:12:34] are you talking
[1:12:37] about he said no we don't need nobody to
[1:12:39] interpret it for us we know it was
[1:12:42] eternal life they had fallen
[1:12:44] from all right
[1:12:49] now brother brandham said that Adam had
[1:12:52] eternal life
[1:12:55] that's blasphemous
[1:12:58] names which is probably L of 13 on yours
[1:13:01] 14 on mine or whatever for look at you
[1:13:04] not Blasphemous names
[1:13:09] 1962 then why would we struggle for
[1:13:11] eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul
[1:13:14] breathe cuz that's what he's explaining
[1:13:15] like you know people believe in an
[1:13:17] eternal soul and then they breathe it's
[1:13:19] a you breathe in the Moya they call it
[1:13:21] in Africa you just breathe in and
[1:13:22] breathe out see if you did you breathe
[1:13:24] out and elephant get it you breathe in
[1:13:27] and you'd get it you breathe out and
[1:13:29] line get it you breathe in that's what
[1:13:30] he's explaining and we don't believe in
[1:13:33] it like that that's not what it is
[1:13:34] that's not eternal life right so what
[1:13:37] does he say but God specially upon Adam
[1:13:41] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[1:13:43] he became an eternal person with God he
[1:13:46] had power of God he was an amateur God
[1:13:49] Etc now Adam then had eternal life
[1:13:55] brother brandom are you explaining that
[1:13:57] Adam fell from eternal
[1:14:02] life how could
[1:14:07] he how could that take
[1:14:11] place but what did Adam fall
[1:14:17] from there's the key
[1:14:21] right Adam was eternal in his soul right
[1:14:25] amen but he wasn't Eternal in his body
[1:14:28] and his spirit amen all
[1:14:31] right you agree amen he wasn't Eternal
[1:14:35] in his body and his Spirit but you see
[1:14:38] had he not Fallen he would become
[1:14:40] Eternal in body and spirit y true right
[1:14:46] had to fall not come into
[1:14:48] existence so what did Adam fall
[1:14:52] from becoming Eternal in body and spirit
[1:14:55] to match his soul y
[1:15:00] right what about it so he did fall from
[1:15:04] eternal
[1:15:07] life he fell from coming to the position
[1:15:10] of Body Spirit and soul as being
[1:15:16] Eternal because of sin that's what we're
[1:15:19] doing now is to come into the place that
[1:15:22] the body and spirit can be the soul is
[1:15:25] redeemed 49 of the future home waiting
[1:15:28] the Redemption of the
[1:15:32] body see then your spirit is not
[1:15:35] Eternal right your body is not
[1:15:40] Eternal now don't For Heaven's Sake
[1:15:42] don't make it
[1:15:44] anointing cuz an anointing ones would
[1:15:46] have an eternal spirit you got a problem
[1:15:48] see just don't go go that way just stay
[1:15:50] with me and
[1:15:51] listen all right
[1:15:55] the then what happened in the
[1:15:58] garden they never reached the Eternal
[1:16:01] position that God would have brought it
[1:16:04] to had there not been a
[1:16:07] fall so they fell from eternal life to
[1:16:10] what the prophet said to
[1:16:14] death did Adam lose that eternal life
[1:16:17] that he had and die if he did you may be
[1:16:21] careful he could have been sent to hell
[1:16:22] then
[1:16:24] right cuz you'd have to give it back to
[1:16:26] him
[1:16:28] somewhere
[1:16:31] right so what is the prophet
[1:16:36] saying there's no way for you and I to
[1:16:39] fall from eternal life that's right God
[1:16:42] would be defeating his own
[1:16:45] purpose but you and I are not Eternal in
[1:16:48] body and spirit we can sure flat go by
[1:16:51] the grave because of our stubbornness
[1:16:53] right and refusing to accept what God
[1:16:55] has
[1:16:57] said we have the choice of whether or
[1:17:01] not we're going to walk off this Earth
[1:17:02] in eternal life or we're going by the
[1:17:04] grave right
[1:17:08] right all
[1:17:10] right but you
[1:17:13] see he never lost
[1:17:17] Adam Adam was
[1:17:22] redeemed that's right his soul was
[1:17:25] eternal
[1:17:28] amen but when sin came into being no one
[1:17:33] else could be born that
[1:17:38] way but still God's right when he says
[1:17:41] All Souls are mine the soul that sinth
[1:17:44] shall
[1:17:49] die there's no way that it says in the
[1:17:51] Bible you to body this body that sinth
[1:17:54] shall die and it doesn't say the spirit
[1:17:55] that sinth shall die so they're not the
[1:17:57] important two parts of us it's the
[1:18:02] soul do you have eternal life it's only
[1:18:05] in your
[1:18:06] soul can't be in any other place right
[1:18:10] that's right so what's the difference
[1:18:11] between a man and an
[1:18:15] animal next
[1:18:17] quote Fellowship by Redemption animal
[1:18:20] don't have a soul right but a man has a
[1:18:23] soul and therefore that soul is a part
[1:18:27] of
[1:18:30] God now listen and even in its Fallen
[1:18:40] estate yet it's the most greatest
[1:18:44] species of all the species of the
[1:18:46] earth is the man
[1:18:49] yes just we just need to get him he said
[1:18:52] to get in connction connection with his
[1:18:53] maker am that's right all right now
[1:18:58] here's where we go because your two Soul
[1:19:00] people taught it this way that when you
[1:19:02] born into the world that God gave you a
[1:19:06] soul and the devil gave you a
[1:19:12] soul now the devil cannot create
[1:19:19] right but he did pervert the nature of
[1:19:23] your
[1:19:24] soul that's right souls in prison page
[1:19:29] 11 the nature of your soul is God if you
[1:19:34] are born
[1:19:35] again if not it is of the
[1:19:40] world I quoted that to a man and he said
[1:19:43] why Brother D you Soul just to
[1:19:46] Nature said how can nature have a nature
[1:19:48] I said go argue with the
[1:19:51] prophet you wanted the statement I gave
[1:19:53] it to
[1:19:55] you he said the nature of your soul is
[1:19:58] God if you're born
[1:20:00] again the so your soul is the very part
[1:20:04] of your being that's your person that's
[1:20:06] who you are amen that's
[1:20:08] right now I'll say it and go ahead with
[1:20:11] it then the Soul is the only
[1:20:16] possibility of having the connections to
[1:20:19] Redemption right
[1:20:21] right
[1:20:25] so we can see how the soul was back
[1:20:29] there without it being our own
[1:20:33] conception we might be able to see what
[1:20:35] Redemption really
[1:20:38] is
[1:20:40] okay so let's go slow
[1:20:45] then man because of the
[1:20:48] Fall fell to
[1:20:51] death that's
[1:20:54] right he couldn't come to eternal
[1:20:58] life right so the scriptures right that
[1:21:01] when he breathed into the nostrils of
[1:21:03] Adam he became a living Soul that's
[1:21:05] right blasius 9 brother Brandon said he
[1:21:08] was a living moving human
[1:21:10] being and I've always tried to explain
[1:21:13] to you if you put a body and a spirit in
[1:21:17] a man and then you put a soul in there
[1:21:19] that wouldn't have been
[1:21:20] Adam you know if You' made it God soul
[1:21:22] so L be
[1:21:24] God that's what Jesus
[1:21:28] was but you see he was already brother
[1:21:31] around and said his feet was sticking in
[1:21:32] the
[1:21:33] earth now we'll get back to that Genesis
[1:21:36] 1: 126 and 27 cuz that's two men
[1:21:39] remember right that's
[1:21:40] right yep the eternal life has got to
[1:21:44] come from the 126 and 27 that's right y
[1:21:48] all right now we'll get back to that but
[1:21:51] the main thing I want you to do now is
[1:21:52] go with me and just just think about
[1:21:55] what
[1:22:00] said before I even read any I want you
[1:22:03] to remember one
[1:22:06] thing there has never been but one
[1:22:09] Eternal God that's right right there has
[1:22:11] never been but one eternal life
[1:22:14] right y there has never been but one
[1:22:17] Eternal Soul right
[1:22:21] amen
[1:22:23] All Souls were
[1:22:25] created and in God's mind the prophet
[1:22:28] will say I can give you the other quote
[1:22:30] on it that before the world ever
[1:22:38] begun in God's mind he saw Every Soul
[1:22:41] that would ever be on earth that's
[1:22:44] right amen and he saw who would receive
[1:22:47] eternal life and who
[1:22:50] wouldn't All Souls belong to God Satan
[1:22:53] cannot give you a soul that's right
[1:22:56] right you say it's just a nature no it's
[1:22:57] not just a nature come on it is a soul
[1:23:00] is not just a
[1:23:03] nature it's you right then you have a
[1:23:07] nature
[1:23:09] right come on if your soul is of God you
[1:23:14] got the nature of God if it's not you
[1:23:16] got the nature of the world so we all
[1:23:17] had the nature of the world and we must
[1:23:20] receive eternal life right all right
[1:23:23] so now remember there can't be but one
[1:23:25] Soul that's Eternal that's
[1:23:28] right and we're not going to go back and
[1:23:31] be redeemed any further than where I
[1:23:33] stopped this
[1:23:36] morning when I said that one man
[1:23:38] standing there that was one almighty God
[1:23:42] that was the Eternal L go the theophany
[1:23:45] the word
[1:23:47] form we had to be
[1:23:51] there well there your
[1:23:54] soul you can't have souls now we'll read
[1:23:57] it in here the prophet use word Souls
[1:23:59] but listen at
[1:24:03] it there's not but one soul that can be
[1:24:06] a part of God that's
[1:24:08] right so now let's start
[1:24:13] reading look at the message
[1:24:17] uh well we were on it right then
[1:24:20] Fellowship by Redemption 195
[1:24:24] 55 okay but man has a soul and therefore
[1:24:28] that soul is a part of
[1:24:31] God and even in its Fallen
[1:24:36] estate now what's he
[1:24:40] explaining the soul comes from God
[1:24:43] that's
[1:24:44] right soul can't come from the devil see
[1:24:47] get that out of your mind that Satan
[1:24:48] creates
[1:24:50] right he can't do it
[1:24:53] right the only thing he can create is
[1:24:57] confusion he can pervert you because
[1:25:00] that's what brother R said even those
[1:25:01] Fallen Angels do he said they'll pervert
[1:25:04] you and give you a
[1:25:08] nature those demons that fail will come
[1:25:11] and give you a nature as I said the
[1:25:13] little child raises up in the in the
[1:25:15] hospital room you know the first thing
[1:25:16] he does he blinks his eyes and he can't
[1:25:18] see too good and he hears a nurse saying
[1:25:19] so here's a full moon look at all the
[1:25:21] blanky black babies
[1:25:23] coming first thing the child hears is
[1:25:26] garbage can starts right then perverting
[1:25:31] it you can think what you want to about
[1:25:33] brother DAV and whatever you do you can
[1:25:35] train a child up in the way that it
[1:25:37] should
[1:25:40] go and you can teach it a
[1:25:43] nature oh of course now we're in the day
[1:25:47] that you're not supposed to whip
[1:25:48] children let them be what they want to
[1:25:51] be yeah look what theyve turned out to
[1:25:55] be
[1:25:57] right but you
[1:25:59] know I thank God for every whipping I
[1:26:02] ever got
[1:26:03] amen I needed a whole lot
[1:26:07] more but you see we are the ones who
[1:26:11] give our children a
[1:26:13] nature
[1:26:15] right we're the ones either used of God
[1:26:18] to bring it into a good position or
[1:26:20] we're used of the devil to bring it into
[1:26:22] a bad one either one you want to talk
[1:26:23] about that's
[1:26:25] right but brother Dale you're throwing
[1:26:27] off on me no I'm not throwing off on you
[1:26:29] I'm throwing off on what the devil's
[1:26:30] done with our minds and our ways and do
[1:26:32] it that's
[1:26:36] right that child Stomps that foot when
[1:26:38] it's about 3 years
[1:26:41] old you let it go and stomp it at 3: and
[1:26:44] at 5 it's going to kick you and beat you
[1:26:46] and do everything in the world that's
[1:26:48] right that's
[1:26:49] right but you take that little child in
[1:26:52] and you then don't whip it without
[1:26:54] talking to
[1:26:56] it sit down and explain to you what's
[1:26:58] doing and then turn around give it a
[1:27:00] little spanking it'll remember
[1:27:03] it it'll remember it that's right you
[1:27:07] mothers and daddies we formed the nature
[1:27:09] of our
[1:27:12] children so we either was a product of
[1:27:14] the devil or God one of the two you the
[1:27:17] best we can do we got a car got a
[1:27:19] problem right if we're going to call it
[1:27:21] God because we're not going to convert
[1:27:23] the child but you know what I'm
[1:27:27] saying you correct that
[1:27:31] child you let it go it's going to be its
[1:27:33] own nature that's right
[1:27:36] amen oh yeah you we're all brother Dale
[1:27:40] he loves these
[1:27:42] children but even a child wants to be
[1:27:48] corrected I didn't say they want a
[1:27:50] whiping come on kid
[1:27:53] you want to be corrected and kept
[1:27:55] straight because you find out Mom and
[1:27:57] Daddy loves
[1:27:58] you all right get off of it keep on
[1:28:01] going he said therefore that soul is a
[1:28:04] part of God see so God created Every
[1:28:07] Soul that ever would be in the world
[1:28:09] that's right
[1:28:10] right Satan cannot create right so God
[1:28:14] created that soul but he created that
[1:28:16] Soul now listen to the wording Every
[1:28:18] Soul that God ever created he had to
[1:28:20] create it perfect right I did not say
[1:28:23] Eternal there is a vast difference
[1:28:26] between Eternal and
[1:28:28] perfect but you show me where God can
[1:28:30] create anything
[1:28:32] imperfect your spirit was perfect the
[1:28:35] world is what perverted it your body is
[1:28:38] the best that he could do to make it
[1:28:40] perfect it used to be that babies were
[1:28:43] almost immune to sickness for about 6
[1:28:45] months especially if they were breastfed
[1:28:48] babies right they were almost immune to
[1:28:50] sicknesses and things
[1:28:54] but now look we're all so perverted
[1:28:56] until poor little kid comes in the world
[1:28:58] that don't have no
[1:29:00] hoes but still God does the best he can
[1:29:02] do to bring it as perfect as he can
[1:29:05] bring
[1:29:08] right see then there's a lot of
[1:29:09] difference in it so then every soul
[1:29:11] belongs to God that's righten every soul
[1:29:15] had to come from God
[1:29:17] y God created it but just because he
[1:29:20] creates the soul don't make it eternal
[1:29:22] right Adam is the only one listed in the
[1:29:25] Old Testament that God breathed into his
[1:29:27] nostrils and he become a living soul and
[1:29:28] the prophet said he become an eternal
[1:29:34] person everybody else is born in sin sa
[1:29:37] in iniquity spouse in their mother's
[1:29:38] womb went forth a
[1:29:41] liar all right their
[1:29:44] soul then is their
[1:29:47] theophany
[1:29:48] amen because Sinners have a theoy Soul
[1:29:53] right cuz the theophany is the basis of
[1:29:55] what you would call a word for a God to
[1:29:57] live in you know or a
[1:30:01] body but it's going downward
[1:30:04] right the new birth turns it to make it
[1:30:07] go
[1:30:08] upward all right eternal life right so
[1:30:12] then you don't have the listen go
[1:30:15] through the Old Testament you don't have
[1:30:16] it mentioned in a Lot About Soul now I
[1:30:18] know what now come on now so don't
[1:30:21] misunderstand I know what David said you
[1:30:23] know my soul thirsts after thee Oh God
[1:30:25] and that's right cuz what is a
[1:30:29] soul first off God created
[1:30:33] it right ever so God created it right
[1:30:38] but he didn't create him perfect
[1:30:40] right I mean Eternal excuse me created
[1:30:44] perfect right had he created Eternal
[1:30:47] then he would never needed eternal life
[1:30:50] so that's not the story that had to be a
[1:30:52] fall to bring all mankind into sin all
[1:30:57] right then that Soul coming from
[1:31:02] God was beautiful and wonderful right
[1:31:06] you know Adolf
[1:31:10] Hitler was probably a good little
[1:31:14] boy you know maybe his mom and daddy
[1:31:17] didn't apply the rod of Correction to
[1:31:18] keep him from going wrong in what he'
[1:31:20] done in life
[1:31:23] maybe they
[1:31:25] did you know he was a high Jew that's
[1:31:29] why he hated the Jews he was half Jewish
[1:31:33] s why wouldn't he been raised under the
[1:31:36] Jewish religion of knowing
[1:31:38] things evidently must not have been but
[1:31:42] listen Every Soul then comes from God
[1:31:46] right all right we got that
[1:31:49] solved Ezekiel 18:4 All Souls her mind
[1:31:52] the soul of the father or soul of the
[1:31:54] son the soul that sinth that shall
[1:31:58] die now it's you it's what you
[1:32:03] are it's you as a
[1:32:05] person it's you in the form of the fact
[1:32:09] of the way you're made so no matter
[1:32:13] where mankind
[1:32:15] is you go to the to the North Pole and
[1:32:18] you find the
[1:32:19] Indians and they're worshiping
[1:32:22] an
[1:32:24] idol you go to Africa India whatever you
[1:32:27] want to do everybody has got some kind
[1:32:30] of a God that's right they said in
[1:32:33] brother cash said in India they got 6
[1:32:35] million Gods I think 3 million or 6
[1:32:37] million God 3 million gods and goddesses
[1:32:39] in India alone amen it' be a good place
[1:32:42] for Paul saying on Mars Hill let me tell
[1:32:45] you about the one but
[1:32:50] everybody I don't care what you are I
[1:32:52] don't care you say I'm an atheist now
[1:32:55] you're an idiot but you can call
[1:32:57] yourself an atheist be what you want to
[1:32:59] and you can say you don't believe in God
[1:33:01] you're
[1:33:02] stupid that's
[1:33:05] right why because you got here that's
[1:33:08] right how did you care of course I know
[1:33:11] kids they talk to you come from this and
[1:33:12] come from that but where did the pow
[1:33:13] come from that's only if the sty teacher
[1:33:16] one of these days you're probably get a
[1:33:17] zero but you know when they start trying
[1:33:19] to teach you all that they say where did
[1:33:20] the pow walk come from
[1:33:24] m y well it come from this come from
[1:33:26] that I never could figure out how it got
[1:33:28] from the alligator alligator to the bird
[1:33:29] that was one I couldn't figure out but
[1:33:31] it's all right the vast jump but
[1:33:35] anyhow Every
[1:33:38] Soul come from
[1:33:40] God Satan can't give you one that's
[1:33:43] right but he perverts the nature of what
[1:33:45] you got okay so everybody with me now so
[1:33:47] every soul has to come from God so the
[1:33:49] prophet sat it that soul is a part of
[1:33:52] God what it's a creation of God yeah in
[1:33:56] a fallen estate you have a conscience
[1:33:59] part about you that you want to serve
[1:34:03] God you want to appease of God and
[1:34:07] they'll take a baby and throw it to an
[1:34:08] alligator God that they claim you know
[1:34:12] to try to appease that God
[1:34:15] right
[1:34:17] right because that conscience part of
[1:34:20] you desires to you
[1:34:26] worship and you want to do that doesn't
[1:34:28] matter what you are you want to
[1:34:30] worship all right see then doing
[1:34:34] that you're calling him your father
[1:34:39] y I'm not making no lie of of religions
[1:34:42] of the world because what if we hadn't
[1:34:44] heard it right you said well Buddha
[1:34:47] Hindu this that other oh all that's just
[1:34:49] lost gone well no brother randam
[1:34:52] according to him he said everybody be a
[1:34:54] judged
[1:34:56] according as to what they
[1:34:59] heard and what was in their life of
[1:35:02] doings and if they had never heard about
[1:35:04] Jesus Christ they would be judged
[1:35:06] according to their own
[1:35:08] laws all right that's right so now God
[1:35:12] is going not going to bring them all up
[1:35:13] you hear about Jesus get him out of here
[1:35:16] get up you didn't need
[1:35:18] no
[1:35:19] yeah no he's going to be judged
[1:35:21] according to what he done with his
[1:35:25] soul so David a man that could go out
[1:35:28] and kill his best friend take his wife
[1:35:31] away from him commit adultery but he
[1:35:33] said Lord my soul thirth after
[1:35:39] thee you know that's what God loved
[1:35:42] about
[1:35:44] him in a lost
[1:35:47] condition all right so now you everybody
[1:35:50] understand so when we start reading read
[1:35:51] these quotes you won't be tied up with
[1:35:53] well now wait a
[1:35:54] minute just just
[1:35:57] listen all
[1:36:01] right look at Jesus Christ you either
[1:36:03] got 16 or 171 Jesus Christ the same
[1:36:06] yesterday today and forever 1955
[1:36:10] 808 now there's two elements just for a
[1:36:13] me few minutes on this subject there's
[1:36:15] two elements that make up the human
[1:36:17] being and one of them is your
[1:36:20] mind and and the other is your
[1:36:24] soul the mind is the is your mental
[1:36:29] thinking you're
[1:36:31] intellectual and your soul is a part of
[1:36:34] God that's in
[1:36:38] you look at that Brother D part of God
[1:36:41] sent you God's Eternal no no remember
[1:36:45] the quote
[1:36:47] before even in a fallen condition yep
[1:36:52] y keep that in mind even in a fallen
[1:36:56] condition the Fallen condition of your
[1:36:58] soul God is still the creator of the
[1:37:00] Soul let's go on next one is attitude
[1:37:04] 1950 we're going to make this second man
[1:37:06] the first man you can't see him God
[1:37:09] second man was a Halo and now he takes a
[1:37:12] third man and makes him like a little
[1:37:14] white light White Cloud coming over we
[1:37:18] can see him Holy Spirit coming down
[1:37:22] and he's all man that's the soul of man
[1:37:25] Eternal
[1:37:26] then and after this man sinned he marred
[1:37:30] that Soul
[1:37:32] amen Blackness Darkness coming to it and
[1:37:36] then God came down and lived in man
[1:37:39] suffered with man and redeemed man and
[1:37:41] the Holy Spirit comes into man and
[1:37:43] drives that Blackness and sin away from
[1:37:45] him and brings it back into perfect
[1:37:48] Fellowship a part of God Amen y
[1:37:53] so now a part of
[1:37:55] God can
[1:37:57] fall in the point of
[1:38:01] what that you're not talking about
[1:38:03] eternal life you're talking about he
[1:38:06] created
[1:38:07] it he created that
[1:38:10] soul and that Soul
[1:38:13] fell
[1:38:15] amen but then he came and gave it
[1:38:17] eternal life right now it's a part of
[1:38:20] God
[1:38:23] see what in the correct
[1:38:25] way just like they said about the theoy
[1:38:28] there's one quote around using about
[1:38:30] sinner having a
[1:38:32] theoy cuz that means a body you're going
[1:38:35] to right if you die right now you're
[1:38:37] going to a body
[1:38:39] right and that can be called a theoy but
[1:38:42] take don't use it as the word Eternal
[1:38:45] theop
[1:38:48] right don't use it that way
[1:38:53] when you get the new birth now you got
[1:38:55] Eternal the offering
[1:38:57] right in the correct order so that's
[1:38:59] what he's saying
[1:39:01] here we marred that soul that God gave
[1:39:05] us perfect yes sir amen but then when we
[1:39:07] got born again it turned the thing
[1:39:09] around amen that's it right there this
[1:39:12] is what I love about it brother Mo used
[1:39:14] to preach this years ago this is about
[1:39:16] 19
[1:39:18] 69 look at the next one Blasphemous name
[1:39:21] which is a couple of
[1:39:22] paragraphs the church is the mystical
[1:39:25] Body of Christ born of the Breath of
[1:39:30] God this is right after he said
[1:39:33] Adam God readed into his nostrils and he
[1:39:35] became an eternal person now watch what
[1:39:38] he says the church is the mystical Body
[1:39:41] of Christ born of the Breath of God did
[1:39:45] you get it the Church of God is born of
[1:39:47] the Breath of God God breathe breath
[1:39:49] into the nostrils spiritually of Adam
[1:39:52] and he became a living Soul did you know
[1:39:54] the Pentecostal church or the true
[1:39:56] Pentecostal church is born to the Breath
[1:39:58] of
[1:40:00] God that's what you New Birth is
[1:40:03] right God breathed in your nostrils of
[1:40:06] the the Breath of Life when you were
[1:40:09] born which made you a living
[1:40:14] soul but now you're talking about
[1:40:16] something
[1:40:19] different let me read you something just
[1:40:21] a minute just go on let me see just a
[1:40:23] minute St John I believe is where I'm
[1:40:26] going to and we'll find out whether or
[1:40:28] not that is what the church is born to
[1:40:30] the Breath of God the same day of
[1:40:32] evening being the first day of the week
[1:40:34] when the doors were shut and the
[1:40:36] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[1:40:37] Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst
[1:40:39] of them and said unto them peace be unto
[1:40:43] you now listen and when he had so
[1:40:47] said he showed them his hands and his
[1:40:50] side
[1:40:51] where then I'm reading for brother brand
[1:40:53] if you're listening were the disciples
[1:40:55] glad when they saw the Lord and Jesus
[1:40:58] and then Jesus and then said Jesus to
[1:41:01] them again peace be unto you as my
[1:41:04] father has sent me so send I you watch
[1:41:08] the father that sent him went in him and
[1:41:10] Jesus when he sends the disciple he goes
[1:41:12] in him same as and when he had said this
[1:41:15] he breathed on them and said receive ye
[1:41:18] the Holy Ghost Church born
[1:41:21] of the Breath of
[1:41:24] God
[1:41:27] now this was in the upper
[1:41:30] room not after the Holy Ghost had come
[1:41:33] on the day of
[1:41:34] Pentecost
[1:41:36] right so they asked brother brandham
[1:41:39] what's the difference brother brandham
[1:41:41] in then receiving on conduct order and
[1:41:43] Doctrine when he say he breathe the
[1:41:45] breath you know breathed upon he said
[1:41:48] one is a promise and the other one is
[1:41:52] happening so when he was standing there
[1:41:54] with the disciples he breathed on them
[1:41:57] and said receive you the holy ghost that
[1:41:59] didn't mean they got the Holy Ghost
[1:42:01] right
[1:42:02] uh-uh they had to go to the upper
[1:42:05] room one was a promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:08] coming in the upper room the other one
[1:42:10] was a coming of the Holy Ghost all
[1:42:13] right when this statur molded itself up
[1:42:15] in here God breathed breath upon them
[1:42:18] receive ye the Holy Ghost do that goes
[1:42:21] all the way into adoption then you're a
[1:42:22] Son of God you can join anything you
[1:42:24] want to but you're born into the Church
[1:42:26] of the Living God born by the Breath of
[1:42:29] God breathe upon them and said receive
[1:42:31] ye the Holy
[1:42:33] Ghost are you
[1:42:37] listening so you can have and say my
[1:42:40] soul is a part of God sure because God
[1:42:42] created
[1:42:44] it there's a lot of difference in having
[1:42:47] the life of
[1:42:48] God and just saying God created your
[1:42:51] soul that's right well let's continue on
[1:42:54] reading we have found him and see 1953
[1:43:00] 511 if you haven't been with the mate
[1:43:03] Jesus Christ and been born of a
[1:43:05] supernatural you can't believe the
[1:43:07] Supernatural and when a man's born in of
[1:43:10] the spirit of God God's a Creator and
[1:43:13] when part of God is I'm a part of
[1:43:15] Charles brandham he's my father he look
[1:43:18] like me or I look like him rather we're
[1:43:21] about the same size and a whole lot of
[1:43:24] features because I'm an offspring of his
[1:43:28] and if I become an offspring of God In
[1:43:30] My Soul then my soul is liking something
[1:43:33] on the order of God Amen it believes the
[1:43:36] supernatural it believes for anything
[1:43:39] see what I mean believe with all things
[1:43:41] hope with all things see then if a man's
[1:43:44] ever been in contact with God and really
[1:43:46] been born again you talk to him about
[1:43:49] Divine Healing sure believes it
[1:43:52] certainly do you believe in Divine
[1:43:53] Healing sure see he's a part of God he
[1:43:55] believes anything can happen with God
[1:43:58] see he's not
[1:44:01] superstitious let's keep on reading
[1:44:03] maybe I'll get through
[1:44:05] four modern events make clear by
[1:44:09] prophecy but the real ordained of
[1:44:12] God that real
[1:44:14] Gene that real
[1:44:17] germ a soul of God that was was in God
[1:44:21] before the foundation of the
[1:44:26] world
[1:44:29] right remember you that got the spirit
[1:44:32] of God in you tonight you were here in
[1:44:36] Christ because he was the fullness of
[1:44:38] the word he was the fullness of the
[1:44:40] godhead bodily God was in Christ
[1:44:41] reconcil the world himself do you
[1:44:43] believe that look he was in Christ then
[1:44:45] if you were in God a gene a word
[1:44:50] attribute from the beginning then you
[1:44:52] walk with here on with him here on Earth
[1:44:56] you talk with him on Earth you suffered
[1:44:58] with him on Earth you died with him at
[1:45:01] Calvary
[1:45:04] amen now if you have eternal
[1:45:08] life future home 1964 802 remember the
[1:45:12] Bible said if that Soul won't do as he
[1:45:15] did said do he will even destroy that
[1:45:19] soul
[1:45:21] but you see he can't destroy himself and
[1:45:24] remain God so if that soul is of the
[1:45:29] world it has to be destroyed right but
[1:45:33] if it's Eternal with God it never did
[1:45:36] begin because it's part of God and can
[1:45:39] never be
[1:45:44] destroyed so All Souls are mine and All
[1:45:49] Souls he didn't create them in the
[1:45:52] Eternal did he there's only one Soul
[1:45:54] created
[1:45:55] Eternal that's why you must die to
[1:45:57] yourself and be born again amen you must
[1:46:00] receive eternal life and to receive
[1:46:02] eternal life you receive what the very
[1:46:04] soul of almighty God
[1:46:07] right which is eternal life because
[1:46:09] there's only one soul that come from God
[1:46:13] eternally every 10 billion trillion of
[1:46:16] people's been in this world there's only
[1:46:18] one come Eternal even didn't come
[1:46:21] Eternal he had to be made
[1:46:24] Eternal but Jesus come Eternal right
[1:46:28] there wasn't a time as these brothers
[1:46:29] say he had to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:46:31] that's that's right what kind of a
[1:46:33] teaching is it but that's right there
[1:46:35] was never a time that he wasn't Eternal
[1:46:37] the body was the only thing that wasn't
[1:46:38] Eternal right okay going
[1:46:42] down works his faith Express 65
[1:46:47] 11-25 you're talking about and the
[1:46:50] spirit can actually make witness of it
[1:46:52] and still it isn't so but if that Soul
[1:46:54] hasn't come from
[1:46:56] God listen it can make all
[1:46:59] impersonations out of it
[1:47:02] here but it cannot be real you can act
[1:47:05] healing you can act like you have you
[1:47:07] can act like you receive it Christians
[1:47:10] can act like they're Christians and act
[1:47:12] and be ever so good at it but that don't
[1:47:15] mean you're saved right that's exactly
[1:47:18] right see the spirit can be there the
[1:47:21] real genuine spirit so now what you
[1:47:23] talking about anointed ones right the
[1:47:26] Holy Spirit can anoint you that still
[1:47:28] don't mean you're saved right there's
[1:47:32] anointed ones right y it's that inside
[1:47:35] Soul That Never Dies it's got eternal
[1:47:39] life it always was eternal life see it
[1:47:41] come from God and goes to God it's the
[1:47:45] soul I like that one I'd underline that
[1:47:49] and stick it in in my Bible and keep it
[1:47:51] by
[1:47:53] you because of what he just said did you
[1:47:55] read
[1:47:57] it there's only one person ever made
[1:48:00] that
[1:48:02] statement one man said one day I come
[1:48:05] from God and I go to
[1:48:09] God now if he stands here in you as a
[1:48:12] born again experience then watch what he
[1:48:14] can say it always was eternal it come
[1:48:18] from God it goes to God it's the soul
[1:48:22] that's right your soul can say that
[1:48:30] right Great Commission 1957
[1:48:33] 804 Divine Healing and salvation for the
[1:48:36] soul is not on the same
[1:48:39] basis all right do we need to explain
[1:48:41] that no we shouldn't
[1:48:44] have when you're healed physically you
[1:48:46] get sick again but the soul is the
[1:48:48] immortal part and Jesus said he that
[1:48:51] heareth my words believeth on him that
[1:48:53] sent me ha that's P tense everlasting
[1:48:57] life and it shall never come to the
[1:49:00] Judgment but it's pass from Death un
[1:49:02] life that settles it but when you are
[1:49:05] born again we're a new but when we are
[1:49:09] born again we are we're a new creature
[1:49:12] and that soul is a part of
[1:49:15] God the Eternal life that comes from the
[1:49:18] Greek word from the the Greek word Zoe
[1:49:22] which means God's own life that makes us
[1:49:25] Sons and Daughters of God we can no more
[1:49:27] perish than God can perish because
[1:49:29] you're a part of him amen future home
[1:49:32] page 49 you're a part of the earth
[1:49:35] you're body your soul is a part of God
[1:49:38] it's an attribute of God displayed here
[1:49:39] on Earth in a body the body is to be
[1:49:42] redeemed now the Soul's redeemed because
[1:49:44] it was in sin so God come down by
[1:49:46] process of justification sanctification
[1:49:49] baptism with the Holy Ghost and redeemed
[1:49:51] your soul and you're be and you being
[1:49:54] part of the earth it Redeemed by it
[1:49:57] you're in the process now it's growing
[1:49:59] on them broken sister
[1:50:03] 6513 that if I had to if I would would
[1:50:06] have know before there was a world when
[1:50:09] we were Souls AP part of God
[1:50:16] Souls a part of
[1:50:19] God
[1:50:21] it don't make all kind of running around
[1:50:23] up there does
[1:50:26] it because there's only one
[1:50:29] soul but what you saying Souls the part
[1:50:32] of God that we are for we were with him
[1:50:37] before the foundation of the world
[1:50:39] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:50:41] life and that's God and we're a part of
[1:50:44] him we was not so much that we would
[1:50:47] know and and could think and had a being
[1:50:52] but we were in his thoughts of what we
[1:50:54] were before the foundation of the world
[1:50:57] because we are a part of him like my son
[1:51:00] is a part of me and I'm part of my
[1:51:02] father and so forth we are Sons and
[1:51:04] Daughters of God by his for
[1:51:06] knowledge leadership
[1:51:09] 65207 your physical contacts to physical
[1:51:13] your spiritual contacts to
[1:51:15] spiritual but inside of that you got a
[1:51:19] soul and that soul is that Gene that
[1:51:22] come from God
[1:51:25] Amen modern events made clear by
[1:51:27] prophecy
[1:51:29] 65205 but the real ordained of God that
[1:51:32] real Gene that real germ this is
[1:51:35] repeat a soul of God that was in God
[1:51:38] before the foundation World remember you
[1:51:40] that's really got the spirit of God in
[1:51:42] you tonight you were in in were here in
[1:51:45] Christ because he was the fullness of
[1:51:47] the word he was the fullness of the
[1:51:48] godhead bodily God was in Christ
[1:51:50] reconciling the world to himself you
[1:51:52] believe that he look he was in Christ
[1:51:55] then if you were in God a gene a word an
[1:52:00] attribute from the beginning then you
[1:52:02] walk with him here on the earth you talk
[1:52:04] with him on Earth you suffered with him
[1:52:05] on the earth you died with him and you
[1:52:08] Rose again and you're communing with the
[1:52:10] word look what did he say it feeds into
[1:52:13] your soul
[1:52:16] y inter Veil
[1:52:18] 56121
[1:52:20] you're taking reasoning and not taking
[1:52:22] Soul's conviction because your soul is
[1:52:26] the part of God that's in you that'll
[1:52:28] agree with God's word being true if not
[1:52:32] you'll just take our if not you'll just
[1:52:35] take our
[1:52:37] intellectual you
[1:52:39] think last one Faith once delivered
[1:52:43] 57
[1:52:45] 610 every spec of petroleum and moisture
[1:52:49] and what all that's in us will be taken
[1:52:52] away but we have one Blessed
[1:52:57] Assurance they never have see the world
[1:52:59] don't have this one
[1:53:01] listen they'll never be able to make a
[1:53:03] bomb that can touch that
[1:53:08] soulen ain't no earthquakes ain't no
[1:53:11] bombs ain't no doings can touch that
[1:53:13] Soul it's Immortal it's a part of God
[1:53:16] I'm so happy tonight Lord because that
[1:53:19] that is possible amen you understand let
[1:53:23] me make sure you don't understand and
[1:53:25] say it plain
[1:53:28] language we talked about this morning
[1:53:30] and brought it up to redeem to that
[1:53:32] person standing there that was the Lord
[1:53:34] Jesus Christ almighty God the
[1:53:38] word IM
[1:53:40] morphe and we had to be in him cuz
[1:53:43] that's as far as we could be redeemed
[1:53:45] now we see that soul that was what was
[1:53:48] standing there in him what
[1:53:51] soul the only one
[1:53:54] soul that ever come Eternal
[1:53:59] right you and I are a part of that Soul
[1:54:02] being made manifest so we're called
[1:54:04] Souls that's
[1:54:10] fine whatever soul that would ever come
[1:54:12] into the world God had to bring it and
[1:54:15] give it
[1:54:17] life and it become a living Soul right
[1:54:21] but to us that have received the New
[1:54:25] Birth the new birth gives eternal life
[1:54:27] to the
[1:54:28] soul makes you and God together the
[1:54:32] prophet said as
[1:54:34] persons right you say well I don't
[1:54:37] persons how else would you say
[1:54:42] it it's your
[1:54:45] soul he gave it to
[1:54:48] you
[1:54:50] all you got to do is just give it back
[1:54:52] to him and let it die now Soul's in
[1:54:55] prison he said if he can get the nature
[1:54:56] of that soul to die then it'll be born
[1:55:00] again amen that's right you say what is
[1:55:02] the New
[1:55:03] Birth when them people back there
[1:55:05] screamed out one day and said what can I
[1:55:08] do to be
[1:55:10] saved that was that Soul screaming out
[1:55:13] Peter said repent everyone and be
[1:55:14] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:55:16] the remission of sin and you shall
[1:55:17] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:20] because it's eternal life right
[1:55:23] amen I believe you must receive eternal
[1:55:26] life amen I believe when you receive
[1:55:28] eternal life that eternal life makes
[1:55:31] your soul Eternal
[1:55:36] right and then we'll get back to it when
[1:55:38] we get on it the next message your soul
[1:55:41] is your theophany
[1:55:44] amen I believe that amen eternal life
[1:55:48] dwelling in you amen you said no my the
[1:55:51] is up you under that's the positive
[1:55:53] that's just like looking at the pyramid
[1:55:55] and you're born again down here at Faith
[1:55:58] but love is what's pulling you that's
[1:56:01] right so when you're born into the world
[1:56:03] and receive eternal life your soul is
[1:56:05] your
[1:56:06] theophany it starts an upward current to
[1:56:10] it pulling it but it's drawing it to the
[1:56:14] positive and if I die I just fit right
[1:56:17] over there cuz that's what the scripture
[1:56:20] says if you'll read it if question this
[1:56:24] Earthly Tabernacle were past
[1:56:28] tense see read your
[1:56:32] Bible you have one waiting
[1:56:35] right everything's waiting on us but
[1:56:37] it's the positive of God's mind that's
[1:56:40] right we're living out the negative upon
[1:56:42] earth right the partial realization a
[1:56:45] lot of people don't like negative cuz
[1:56:46] they say you make you can't make God
[1:56:48] negative brother Brown didn't have no
[1:56:49] trouble with it he seemed to
[1:56:52] understand he'd say we're the
[1:56:55] negative and we get a finish of the
[1:56:58] positive but do you
[1:57:01] understand then that soul that you
[1:57:06] are the nature of that Soul must
[1:57:10] die that's that unclean spirit that is
[1:57:13] driven
[1:57:14] out but now what are you from the time
[1:57:17] that that unclean spirit is driven out
[1:57:18] till you receive the Holy Ghost what are
[1:57:23] you don't give you the new birth cuz the
[1:57:25] unclean Spirit goes
[1:57:27] out you must receive eternal
[1:57:32] life but once you receive it eternal
[1:57:35] life always was
[1:57:36] eternal your soul is a part of
[1:57:41] God the part of God that was standing
[1:57:43] back there that said let there be one
[1:57:46] day stood on Earth and said let there be
[1:57:50] he never said thus sayeth the
[1:57:52] Lord right right come on Jesus didn't
[1:57:56] never said thus sayith the Lord he said
[1:57:58] let there be isin't it odd that brother
[1:58:00] brandham would come back to that and
[1:58:02] tell the bride that that's her position
[1:58:03] that she must come to isn't it odd that
[1:58:06] it was to brother bradam not my words
[1:58:09] but what you
[1:58:12] say Let There
[1:58:16] Be isn't it odd that your Prophet could
[1:58:18] be as a said the other day so close to
[1:58:20] God until he would come out and say
[1:58:22] because of Supernatural Revelation
[1:58:24] because of the opening of The Seven
[1:58:28] Seals I say unto
[1:58:33] you it's supposed to come back not thus
[1:58:35] sayith the lord it's not supposed to be
[1:58:37] just laying on the hands it's supposed
[1:58:38] to be taking what the word
[1:58:42] says and walking on do you see what a
[1:58:46] soul really
[1:58:47] is the real you
[1:58:49] right I don't care whose Soul it is I
[1:58:52] don't care how sinful it is that Soul
[1:58:53] comes from God
[1:58:57] right but then if that nature the
[1:58:59] prophet said of that Soul we can get it
[1:59:01] to
[1:59:03] die God can come in and
[1:59:06] live David had the word come on brother
[1:59:10] he had the
[1:59:11] word he had it hidden his heart brother
[1:59:14] BR said what he needed was the baptism
[1:59:16] of the Holy Ghost that's right that's
[1:59:19] what it needed was the baptism of the
[1:59:21] Holy
[1:59:24] Ghost so that Soul Every Soul come from
[1:59:27] God but there's only one soul that come
[1:59:29] from God
[1:59:30] Eternal that's the very life and soul of
[1:59:33] almighty God and if we have that eternal
[1:59:40] life then you always was eternal that's
[1:59:44] right always was eternal voice you're
[1:59:47] going to lead to sin
[1:59:51] we got one coming here yeah but they're
[1:59:53] supposed to finish this they started it
