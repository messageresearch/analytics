TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you shining in the light of your glory worshiping this morning pour out your power and love Your Glory Holy Holy Ghost s because amen you want to see him turn around and shake his hands may the Lord bless you you'll be in the house of the Lord good to see each and every one of you here brother Collins his wife and two daughters with us brother thank God to have each one of them here right all here happy and Minnie's here happy happy he's happy we're all happy happy to be in the house of the Lord all right amen and um good to be back good to be back with you let's just get these announcements out of the way while everybody's coming in and out and kind of getting settled in the ass brother riches we have just a few extra minutes because it takes a little while for everybody to get settled down and everybody to get all the announcements out of the way and for the kids to go to the bathroom and all that stuff but I want to if you reiterate what daddy said because I've had to mention to some of you that at about 9 45 that place downstairs needs to be quiet and empty if you want to come in and out there's a door out here that you can come in and out not disturb the Sunday school class but not in the place where the coffee is and like I said you shouldn't be making coffee at 9 45 right the coffee is more important than the service than uh than their altar is always open for you to repent right because you need to but uh I think that I was trying to look the quote up where brother Brown said we're missing it in the walk the things that we're doing that the little things the little misbehaviors that we do right we'll handle our service and we'll hinder we'll hinder us from getting anything and I you know I'm not any different than you guys are I I can't just walk into a service and sit down five minutes before and and have my mind on on spiritual things and and having communion with uh with the Lord I know sometimes as deacons and as as preachers and all we have to do things we have to you know uphold laws and stuff but uh you should be in here 15 minutes tell right you should be in here you know you know if you go to a football game here we go again you go to a Georgia game you're going to get there at halftime no you gonna make sure you're there four hours in advance because you want party think about it that's right doctor's visit you don't get that one you make sure you're there because you don't want to miss getting see what that doctor has to say to him and uh this is more important than any of that there's nothing as important as the word of God not one thing so by the way of announcement just remember that we will be enforcing that you need to be out of the fellowship part of the hall at least 9 45. all right if you do have to go out there is a door that you won't disturb anybody to go in and out but um we need to be focused on what we're doing children are are vitally important uh we need to get them started right and to get them started right they don't need all these other distractions voices and things people laughing and talking same thing with some of you sisters need to make sure you be quiet when others are foot washing when we wash feet up here as men we Weddle the foot washing services over before we do any talking we leave the sanctuary there's no need for any talking to be going on downstairs or giggling or laughing or even discussing anything it's uh it's to me it's a holy thing I really I enjoy the foot washing part of the service because you're doing the service part so let's keep that quiet too but this listen this Thursday brother Donnie says Susan June myself brother Mark and another brother are going to go on our way to Wichita so remember saying your prayers uh they will be coming back on Monday or sometime but you and I will be staying so remember sending prayers we'll be there brother pinson's until Wednesday of the following week preaching for him and then going on to brother claude's for Saturday and Sunday June the second third then June and I'll be flying back on the fourth on Monday so just keep sending prayers we'll be gone for two weeks or two weekends not two weeks but two weekends also remember June 14th 15th 16th is the um the annual fishing trip for all the men and the young boys make sure you put your name up downstairs we need to know how many are going to go a lot of you are signed up but please don't wait till the last minute all right just do that also next Sunday at five o'clock in at Winterville Pavilion it's where they're going to have the memorial service for for brother Ronnie Marlo and uh the second service here will begin at 1 45 right so the day we'll be preaching starting at two o'clock and then who all of you that wants to go can go I told Brother David that we will be in Kansas at that time but that's okay just support him with your prayers and go down there and and be with them so that's next Sunday second service starts at one 45 all right also remember July the 15th at five o'clock there is a sign up sheet downstairs on the refrigerator we're going to begin another Financial Peace class it will be taught here at the church at five o'clock July the 15th on Sundays at from five to seven for the next 10 weeks after that so keep us in your prayers for that if you want to please sign up downstairs I have requested that the one that's already took the class that we're teaching which the last class will be this coming Thursday uh the 13-week class that some of you are already participating in we need to have some of you stay and keep some of the kids for the ones that wants to be in the class all right because I want everybody to be in the class that wants to be in class I don't want no excuses I'm keeping somebody's kids so I can come to the class know half of you in this Sanctuary has already took class so y'all can kind of all get together and and you don't have to do it every Sunday make a schedule you know well I'll keep them this week I'll keep this week brother boy and sister again they're going to be doing some things with them too so they can go outside and play for five to seven but we're going to have that class 14 weeks and some of you have children we will keep the children somehow some way and so you can participate in the class so this really helped us out I'll give you some numbers later when we get back of how much we've saved and how much we've been able to pay off debt and how much debt we've been able to avoid and it's uh astronomical how much we've saved in 13 weeks and how much we've paid off and how much we've avoided in 13 weeks rocking up close to 100 Grand of of debt that people devoided just to 20 something people is in the class so we thank God for that we still have to live down here brother Collins we still have to live in this world money still runs the place yeah you know but God's give us a brain I like what brother oh Brady always said he said you know what you can be super spiritual and you can be all what you want to say but not give you five senses to contact this Earth with right and he give them to you to use all right just try sometime stay home psychologist pay my bills for me if you do it without attitude you'll be meeting him at the bank and then you'll be meeting him at the courthouse and then you'll be meeting him at the jailhouse because God's not going to pay your bills for you he's gonna he'll help you and he'll take you where you need to be but we don't need to be sluggered we remember that in the Book of Proverbs if you're a slugger then uh then you're not you're an Infidel all right so let's bow our heads as we get started here we're going to uh we're going to do all this in Reverse we started last time with a marriage and went down from the marriage and the role of the male and the role of the female down through the dating part well now we're going to start on the dating part and go backwards because that's what's fresh on your mind and we'll get that back fresh on your mind and then come back to this afternoon and this afternoon uh at least you could all make sure you be here especially the ones with children because I'm going to talk a little bit about more about the children and your role with the children than I did last time so let's just go to the Lord in prayer and pray that we get this finished today dear heavenly father we pray Lord as you be with us Lord one more time rather we ask you to forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make do we make them Lord sometimes Lord we feel so insufficient but father you told us that this is the way we're going to have to get it through Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists that you've given Lord to fulfill your gift and fulfill your word to get a people ready to perfect the Saints to get us ready for a Rapture father and to help us live our daily lives by the way I ask you to be with the sick ones that are Among Us Lord and also the sick ones that are not among us that should heal Him Father and touch them be with them Lord you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction so as the word Goes Forth we pray Lord that you would just touch him and being here that's the Lost Lord I pray that you save the soul father that's the most important thing is getting getting that Soul saved Lord and getting filled with the Holy Ghost and being a a vital part of the congregation Lord a part of your economy father we know we have to live in this economy and we have to do the things that Caesar tells us to do but father you have a greater economy the one that will take care of all things it doesn't need money to run Lord just need people to yield to you father we pray that you should be with us now take care of us keep us strengthen Us in Jesus name amen all right first Peter three that's where we started and we're going to read that today hold them up brother Richards last weekend I love those screens because it sure does make things go faster you can cover a lot more ground but first Peter 3 verse one through seven for those of you that haven't been here or that had forgot this is pretty much telling you the whole walk of a husband a wife and what they're supposed to do but it also brings them together as a couple and and it also shows us to me this verse one through seven shows how that God is restoring Fellowship back that we lost in the Garden of Eden right because we lost it in the garden and God's going to bring it back that's the whole Redemptive process exactly husband and wife family uh we can go to the spiritual part of it but we may do that later on I've been thinking about that a little bit uh yesterday and even this morning think about maybe going back to the spiritual part and doing a series of of how that that we you know that God courts us and and God gives us little things and God's our father but God's also our husband all right so courtship and dating is what we're going to begin with this morning but let's read first Peter verse first Peter 3 verse one through seven likewise he wives being subjection to your own husbands and if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wise now that's very powerful we'll get into that this afternoon while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear right who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of planning the hair and wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which in the sight of God of great price you read that one more time even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price right all right after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are not period comma as long as you do well right not everybody's Sarah not everybody's Abraham but you are Sarah as long as you do well daughters they're up and are not afraid with any amazement likewise he husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as into the weaker vessel and it's being heirs together right of the grace of Life listen to this that your prayers be not hindered amen you do this wrong from one to six you do something wrong and there it hinders your prayer with God it hears your prayer life now let's go to Matthew 19 4-6 and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female so there is no surprise that we are now male and female huh and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh right wherefore they are not no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together read that with me here what therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder you may be seated in that Lord had his Blessing now that was the that was the god of Glory telling us that right that was in red letter we just don't have the red layer part up here on the screen but that's where Jesus was telling them he answers and said unto him have you not read right neither which made them at the beginning made them male and female all right so now I told Brother Anderson he's got long fingers so he's gonna have to really punch buttons back there to get these quotes and all up on the screen because we're brother Collins we preach 12 sermons on this and we're gonna have to do it in two so we've got to listen real quick okay all right we're finished let's go home did you get that now listen I want to tell you too brother Joe said he's got all this together compiled this is a compilation of all 12 sermons today so you can get it online if you want to and I'm going to just hit the high points all right now brother random quote number one do you think I'm a brown let's let the prophet tell us and then let's go through this process yeah there's another choice that we have in life that's a life companion a young man or young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice right the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject the young man chooses the young lady has the opportunity to say yes or no right but it's still a choice on both sides both man and woman they have a right to Choice also you have a choice also as a Christian now number two and this is where we're going to get the basis of what we're doing today and I know some of you know what you know where we've been but I believe it works if we would have all done this older ones if we would have all done this we would have not been in the shape we're in or would not have had the problems that we had before right all right so we got another generation you know they asked brother Brown they said brother Brown what if you knew God was coming tomorrow he said he's building a house building a house right now he said he's getting married get married you know College we thought 1977 was it well my that's what 40 something years now so that's going to be ignorant that's gonna be ignorant and say well our children are never going to grow up brother Brown said if you knew God was coming in the morning right not if you didn't know he said if you knew he was coming in the morning and you were building a house he should continue to build a house right if you were planting potatoes continue to plant potatoes he even told him he said if you're planning on getting married he said get married but we can't be we can't wait in fear a lot of people did that in the 70s the fear was 77 was it so but you know I didn't have a chance and you know Daddy was ridiculed for letting us go to college because number one again education was of the devil you know and number two we weren't going to be around here long enough yeah well I've got grandkids now oh Jesus comes tomorrow but I don't mind having a few grandkids amen you know I mean I know but we're going to we're going to preach what brother Brown said he said preach like everybody saved and preach like everybody's lost yeah right and that's what you got to do you got to preach you got to sing so that's what we're doing we're saying it right we've got a lot of young people sitting in the auditorium tonight or this morning that that if you will listen to some of us older ones it'll take care of a lot of your problems right later on in life you're going to have enough problems if you live almost perfect with God you're still going to have problems because you still got the devil standing there in the in this old flesh beating on you right all right but look let's see what a prophet tells us of the shooting of a bride which you know you have to plan look Pray when you're choosing yeah three things we're going to break them down plan look and pray when you're choosing but we see by this the Word of Promise he's a bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him now could you imagine a man filled with the Holy Ghost take something like that to be a wife now what he's talking about is Jazzy about all right the congregation says no I I just don't see it brother now maybe I'm just an old crank but you know I just can't understand that see notice where it's going to reflect what's in him she is going to help him make his future home so the first thing we're going to talk about is planning planning looking and praying remember what we talked about a plan a method of arranging and I wrote that in capital letters at the end in advance you don't plan as you go you adjust as you go but you don't plan as you go you make a plan you have a business plan you go buy a business plan yeah sure there's bumps in the road and there's things you got to you got to adjust but at least you have a plan same thing with choosing a mate same thing with choosing a uh you know in finances or in business or whatever you know let's don't be so narrow-minded right how many of you got to get up go to work in the morning ninety percent of you eighty percent of you right so that's something part of my life man because Paul's playing First Corinthians 9 26 I therefore still run not as uncertainly relicans he knew where he was going yeah not as uncertainly same thing with you and I not as uncertainly so if I I'm not as one that beat at the air right so he made a plan he had a plan you and I brother Randleman uh in uh Christ Mission Garden real he said God had a what plan and a purpose so God had a plan probably man I know there was a lot of you thought I was cuckoo talked about a plant made no you need to make plans everybody needs to make a plane if you're playing better you'd get here before shirt starts right now praise the Lord in him and remember I always told you if you failed a plan your plan will always fail if I understand what I'm saying right if you fail to make a plan that plan will always fail right because you failed to make it same thing with choosing a spouse this is a lifelong commitment this is not like the world this is not something that we just oh I made a mistake you can't hit reverse on this one you can't hit rewind on this one right supposed to be so death do you part right that's right pretty serious a lot of other things you got to do to death to your part but that one you got to do from Death to you part so the planning part is very very important find out what you want to do your choice reveals your goal this is the list do you think of a brine now you can't have all things there might be one girl that's really pretty and the other girl maybe her statue looks better than this one and you might have to sacrifice one for the other but if you snuck the stature of the lady of a woman and she I don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at her character right whether she's pretty or not pretty now for it is becoming if a Christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine born-again woman amen regardless of what she looks like right we think different we'll get into in a few minutes we think we can change people it's what she is what makes her and then again that reflects his own Godly character and reflects what's in his mind and what's going to be in the future for his family will be raised by such a woman right for the future plans for his home if he managed one of these little modern Ricketts sex Queens what could he expect what kind of a home could a man expect to have a female is a girl that ain't got enough morals about her to stay home take care of the house and wants to work out in somebody's office what kind of a housekeeper will she be yeah you'll have babysitters and everything else true that's the prophet all right not my words after Prophet so there we go we need to plan pick out a character no I've told you sit down you young people and and make a plan I asked Tyler the other day I said what are you going to do and he said I'm going to college I'm going to do this and that's okay we started the plan most people when you get out of school they don't want to go down I don't know and you know why five years later I don't know because you ain't got a plan for something right if you fail get up and start again but at least do something what did Jesus tell the parable about the man that he gave the coins to yeah once at all I'm not going to use it I'm going to hide it the other ones took it out and what made money with it right the one that was the parable he said you take away from that man that held his and give it to the others right because he took his money and shoved it under a place and didn't let it work all right same thing with the plan you gotta make this thing work now number two the looking stage we got to get through this we got about 26 pays in here looking to turn one's eyes towards something but look don't look too naturalized look through spiritualized right because when you look it's not bad to look especially young people you gotta look you got eyes all right but look with a purpose look where they planned look through spiritual eyes listen to this that's always stuck with me of how that was remember he did the wedding ceremony of the people on the hill the real rich people and then they did the ceremony of the people down alley that was that was living in a box car sisters how many of you would live in a boxcar yeah didn't think so there that's always something nobody said anything that's always stuck with me now you might live in a box car but may not be the one you went right now one chose a beautiful girl the other one chose character now that's the only way that's the only way you could chew right first look for character and then if you love her fine notice God first Adam didn't have a choice for his wife he didn't get a choice God just made him one and he didn't get to choose her so we find out that she let him astray from God's word he didn't get to pray over the matter he isn't like you and I he didn't get a choice but you and I got a choice to look at character right so there's a looking part but as we're looking you listen to what we're saying let's go to the next one see everybody would have thought and when we did this this came along later on in the in the uh in the sermon you think well the first thing you got to do is look for love I don't I don't think so because you got a plan you know what you don't know who's gonna fit that plan right you know you and then you go to look and then you may have to look around you know you might have to shop a little bit but that's okay as long as you're doing it with spiritual lives exactly all right not just Western after everything but see looking for Real Love see this is what most of us thought was the only thing to look for and it's not the first thing to look for but it is important do not look for what the world calls love because it's selfish and self-centered I I mean me look at me everybody say amen amen you look at the world today what you gonna do for me that's not love that is not love no love is not selfish and self-centered it's what it's a servant right we'll talk about that in a minute real love gives of itself you really can't explain true love you have to just work your way into it yeah isn't that right come on people have been married over 30 years 20 years I'll be 32 years coming up 30 dude green Lord I was going to remember that 33. y'all should be 29 in a couple of days so we were married for four years before that so 33. and have faith on that one didn't I faith is the key but Jen and I learned to love each other right you that have been married a while you had to learn to love your partner you had to work but you're not a clue what love is that's why I want you to look at the at the planning part plan and say hey this is what I want to do in my my life I told you many times before you men if you want to plan after your life that you don't want your wife to ever work you better get a good job but if you're not talk to the person you're gonna look at and say hey you're gonna have to work so I can go hunting yeah that's selfish in south standard we don't need to do that nobody ain't in that would you please but you see what true love is though true love is not selfish that's right what get what gets people in divorce situations is selfishness right self-centered right some of you that's been divorced I don't want you to raise your hand but you know that's true self-centered selfish and we still have a little bit of that anyway yeah but you really can't explain true love but faith is a key because brother random we're going to look at in just a little while her brother Brown said you've got to have faith in her right she's got to have faith in you all right hey we're living life here okay all right now 5A the absolute you when you get married they're had to wind back through your mind I love them when you got married there had to wind back through your mind so this was during the dating and the courting and all that right anybody understand what brother Brown when you got married there had to wind back through your mind something till you hit that pie pose because somewhere you're gonna say that's the one right and it should have been love for your wife or your husband well maybe she ain't as pretty as John's wife oh well she's not done this or that but there's something about her that you it strikes you right see when I first met Jim she was not a straight-ass student she didn't care about school right he care about any of that but I saw that if somebody would give her a little Direction that she could be good in school right you're the only one who needs to say right that's right so she turned from come back and helped her until she was making A's and B's when she got out of school and she enjoyed going to school it wasn't like she you know school to her was like a babysitter you know she just went to school and then she went home you know somewhere in between there were some teachers yeah but I saw something in her that that was different than what anybody else saw thank God I did you know but that's the something about her that it strikes you you say she might not be as pretty as the other or he might not be as handsome as the other but there has to be an absolute there so when you're planning and looking you're looking for an absolute we know that Jesus Christ is our absolute and our soul right right but we got to look at a character that'll fit our character right right an absolute are you gonna stay married all right that that person is different and there is where you hold on to right if that isn't there you better not get married yeah that typo absolutely let's go to find B questions and answers on the Holy Ghost I've got to know listen this is a prophet this is the prophets Mr Collins listen to this I've got to know what I'm doing before I can have faith in what I'm doing right told you many times before talking about a body changer getting off subject a little bit but we got to understand that body change there's the fear the fear that I know is and I don't know how electricity works so I don't go over there and pull that panel off of that box I know better because I'm I'm scared I'm I have fear but now some of you there's a master electrician all you see that is just like me you know putting up putting a gun together or something that I can do but I'm fear I'm fearful of that because why I don't know how to do it yeah but once I know how to do it just become second nature I just walk over there put the wires where they need to go my same thing brother Brown I got to know what I'm doing before I can have faith in what I'm doing it why don't you marry your wife you had faith in them no no look at this you had tried her watched her looking watch Turner seeing what seeing what she come from who she was that's the way with a scripture with God and then he's talking about us in the in the spiritual same way because God tries us God watches us because I see what God sees what's going to call what kind of qualities we have therefore then he can entrust you certain things like the statue of a perfect man he's not going to give me these virtues because they're just there that's right power without character is what satanic but Power with character power able to handle these gifts expect to rule God's not going to give him all this We're Not Gonna I hope that when Jim and I fly back in a couple of weeks but I don't see a 14 year old kid at the front of the airplane yeah well the captain's thing on yeah doing bubble gum and throwing spit wands and then we're gonna get this plane up somehow no you're gonna have somebody there that's had what experience right somebody knows how to do it and that's the same way with you and I that's why I wished it I wish that I would have listened to my parents I you know I told my kids the kids get any of you kids want to be famous I know you want to be people that know you and be famous just how you gonna be famous yeah yeah you do you know how you want to be you know how you're going to be famous if you'll do everything your parents tell you right and do it all right you'll be the only kid in the world ever do that they'll have you on Time Magazine they'll have you in People magazine they'll have you on Oprah Winfrey they'll have to have you on all kinds of things right that's right because you did exactly what your parents said so we're not talking a bunch of people that's done all this to the Perfection right right you're not all done this to Perfection but we hope that what little bit we can do will help us because remember what brother Brown said and I didn't put it in here he said it's the primer of things what primary yeah you don't jump to high school you go to primary school he said these primer things is where we're missing it at all right same way with husband and wife we still you gotta have hits yet all right right next one praying now what does praying do to make Earnest petition that's what praying means to make Earnest petition God give me a good wife God give me somebody that can help me because June June is an accessory she enhances me she she's and I believe she does I mean she doesn't sometimes but I believe she really does same way with you you accessorize your your mate and I will get into that with the uh male and female tonight or this afternoon in Hebrews chapter 7 part two I'll remember sister Esther God's knows are the best yeses you can have yeah yeah so if God tells you no then you say thank God man amen Tyler all you Brothers and God says no if you feel checked no that's right that's the best yes you'll ever get because he knows if you make this Choice with your free moral agent you make any choice you want if you make this choice this is what's going to happen down the road right right so his nose are the best yeses that you can have right marriage is Honorable but it should be entered prayerfully and reverently praying and genuine love for that woman will bind you together forever what you bind on Earth I'll buy it in heaven when you walk down the street you notice you may get old and gray and wrinkled but that same love you had for her when she was a young beautiful woman you'll still have it right you may get stoop shouldered bald headed wrinkled face and everything else but she'll love you just like you did when you stood when you stand with wide shoulders and curly hair if it's really good right for you're looking to the time when you've crossed the river Yonder when you'll spring back again to young men and women to live together forever that's God's Eternal promise he said he would do it he not only that we'll get to in a man he swore he would do it man so husbands and wives that are getting older and you're getting you know you're getting where things don't work like they used to you know your joints get aching and all that stuff just remember one thing you're going to be in the youth the prime of your youth with your mate for an eternity so what are we heading to Glory we're heading to what we should have had had there not been a fall right right and it includes husband and wife and children right right it includes husband and wife and children we're not going to be all separated all over Heaven I'll read that to you when we get to the mother part brother Brown says you'll be there with your family for an eternity right right that's why the promise that I look at is is and Isaiah says you'll be there with your Offspring well who is that that's your children right and your children's children that's your grandkids all right so you're there with your family that's why I went downstairs we have that list of people which is your family my family written down here that we pray for every day I keep them on my desk every day and it reminds me to pray for these people every day to pray for them to come back to the Lord all right let's go to the next one number seven Prophet Elijah now that's what we do sometimes we often go off on a tantrum somewhere and not think about God and not pray over it I ask the Lord whether we should do it or not we find out that our supply of blessings it's cut off yeah you read that we find out that our supply of blessings is cut off then we wonder sometimes well wonder why I can't have no more blessing you don't watch you let down on your prayer life you said well I'm a Christian well that's the more sign you should pray more than ever read the Bible every day pray every day do we do this do we do this read the Bible every day pray every day don't make any decision too harshly or too quickly this is the prophet this man knew how to live life and face nobody in the world knew how to live life this man knew how to live life all right in the natural and in the spiritual right read the Bible every day pray every day don't make any decisions too harshly or too quickly without first considering God about it ask him shall I do this father ask him is this your will for me to do this and see what the holy spirit will speak to you he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you to let you know if you'll be sincere be sincere and ask him right all right now there's a few things we need to look at right here when we're dating I'm either getting into the dating stage listen to this note before we enter the dating phase let's look at some clear do's and don'ts these things should be discussed before a serious relationship begins do not do not date an unbeliever do not be unequally yoked that's right don't now listen some of us did no one's dead so I can't I can't say I did that but you know what I was an unbeliever too right so let's go back to the typos be a believer first and then don't date an unbeliever you know that's right because an unbeliever is going to date an unbeliever every time yeah right I believe we're gonna date an unbeliever every time yeah yeah because most of the time you can't get a believer in unbeliever hardly together especially during the dating part because One's Gonna want something and the other one's not you understand what I'm saying do not date a divorced person with a living spouse now that ought to be self-explanatory brother Devil's been through all that these are some things that you don't even get involved with don't start a relationship that's why I said pray plan pray look and pray talk to the person talk to the person you told me hey you never know remember I told you the story about the brother that that was uh marrying a lady and they got to the they got to the wedding night and he found out she had been when somebody had a child she forgot to tell him I guess yeah but I if he would have asked that question it's not bad to ask that question not bad to ask these questions right you ever been engaged before right you've been engaged brother now like I said before it's a vow do not date someone that's been previously engaged if you've ever said yes if you say no don't worry about it but if you've ever said yes to another person don't date them because you can't marry him in God's eyes they're married to that person they were engaged to man right that's right right according to the vows in the Book of Numbers right you vile vile brother Brown said it's a vowel that marries you correct do not date thinking you will change them after marriage this is the devil's trap yeah dating is not a witnessing opportunity right well if I'm just getting to come to church yeah okay yeah or her become the church were they not going to want you to go to church for them then they're going to want you to do this because you know what I'm Believers going to want you to do something with them so I don't date an unbeliever yeah if you date a believer right here's the place to be yeah do not Date spoiled or selfish people well knocks a lot of us down huh remember what we said about that though brother Brown talked about spoiling selfish people I cut out all these quotes remember this is 12 sermons and two all right so do not Date spoiled or selfish people you can find out real quick he was spoiled and selfish number six remember this one is very important do not flirt do not flirt with anybody brother Brown said don't you even make eyes I didn't bring the quote with that but don't you even make eyes you know it's all about Lincoln and whistling and flirting and see it's fake it's a put on that's that's not the person you want to be with it hurts both parties yeah so don't flirt with people giving them a false hope yeah like brothers that we flirt with denominations and we flirt with this one and flirt with that one same thing remember brother Brown when he when he uh discerned that brother Spirit he thought he was running around his wife but he said what he was flirting with organized religion right that's what it was don't flirt with organized religion don't flirt with something that you can't have right because they'll only harm both parties so now as we come to this of the do not I'll show you what to do in this dating phase now it's not the planning and looking and searching look the dating stage of your journey to find a spouse is not the searching stage yeah that's over with you found her you found him not that he smells so good or his hair's slick remember when we read about where he said his mama did the boy had so much grease on his hair he couldn't close his mouth you know that's brother Brown telling you those stories so you know what he saw it he saw the people he saw it happen remember that little girl he dated her Nat was like a swan and all that stuff yeah she was smoking a cigarette and he got away from her pretty quick now the dating stage is not the searching stage that is the planning looking and praying stage planting looking and praying is kind of like a shotgun you know and you're looking you're praying you're planning but the dating stage comes down to one person dating is the time to find one person and start telling about what each of you really think and believe about various puppets that are important in America because you're moving toward a Mary's relationship you're not using the dating system while I'm dating this one and didn't know I'm gonna go and date this one dating should lead straight to marriage yeah right dating should lead straight to marriage all right goes right in here you can really get yourself messed up let's go to the next this is a this is a note here today the world is made dating a cheap relationship based purely on flexially motive that's right while I'm dating this one while I'm dating that one while I'm dating this and that's nothing but a cheap relationship days should be when two people finally get together yeah and say like nobody else I I don't see nobody else get kind of narrow-minded that's okay if you narrow-minded towards her or him yeah but dating is not intended to be a recreational activity you don't go on a date just to get to go to Six Flags that's not a date right that's just being social and it's just being social going but no dating is not intended to be recreational activity or something we do to hang out or have fun do not use dating as a way to get away from hype from the home the dating stage of your journey to find a spouse is not the searching stage that's in the planning looking and praying dating is the time to find out what each of them wanted you to really think and believe about marriage topics you can go ahead and start talking about things that you don't just throw out to everybody but the fact is going to be your bride that's your secret bride you talk to her secret things not and listen keep your conversation clean yeah we'll talk about that amen keep the conversation clean but there are things that you can talk about in the dating stage that you don't talk about the planning and looking and searching and getting ready and this is putting you towards something so wonderful but yet remember at this point it's where the young man that wants to date a girl now girls you don't have to go ask your daddy if you can date Johnny 's responsibility is to ask Daddy at this point is what a young man that wants to date a girl remember brother Brown he won't he remember he drive up to Mr Miss Brown's house he said I knew better than the horn he said I got out of my car and walked up to the front porch and I spoke to Mrs Brum and whoever you know uh hopes of bromback um he said I spoke to both of them all right didn't honk the horn right okay let's go at this point is where the young man wants a day girl that's still under her father's headship she seek her father's blessing before he asked her to date him yeah the parents are now involved in the process looking for warning signs that the two dating cannot see because you do get narrow-minded during this part of the state all right you need to be like brother Keith Reed when he sees two people and getting ready to start dating and get serious he brings them before the church he says okay we as a family are going to watch these two now you got 250 eyes looking at these people they won't be able to breathe if their hair touches each other somebody's gonna go ah but you know what it's for their purity and they're good because we still got this boy right here to deal with woman and man you guys still got this right here this Lux devil right here is what hits you right there all right so if enough eyes get to washing you you'll be careful yeah remember this is a stage where there will be opportunities and temptations to bring guilt and shame to the relationship why because you're getting closer together this will be the time that you will be tested the most this is where you will know if you are a True Believer or not and that's exactly the truth all right now let's go to number eight life brother Brown says how about you man you boys with your girlfriends you girls with your boyfriends if you're God's children conduct yourself like God's children be different I've always told you be different be different if you're different than than you're a testimony and God will protect you but if you want to be like everybody else in the world come on people same thing in our Christian Life right don't walk up against the line we know where the line is right right we've been taught for years where that line is you're supposed to quit not see how close to it you can get amen the world wants you to see that right watch to see that's in you in other words what's inside you that's what the world wants to see because you'll manifest yourself I promise you and I think so remember when you start dating this one is very powerful but we have to cut a lot of this out but she will be someone's wife you remember that number two Sean the very appearance of evil like I said don't get yourself in a position to where something could go wrong don't go and be alone somewhere you're not supposed to be alone right because you know what there's always going to be three of you there you and him and the devil yeah always so be careful bring God in there and let him run the devil out all right number three be a virgin be pure first Timothy 4 12 let no man despise thy youth but these are an example of the Believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith and impurity look impurity be a virgin same way with us as Christians we're supposed to be virgins right virtuous sinless brought of Jesus Christ right well if we can't live it in the natural how are we going to live it in the spiritual all right number four it's good not to touch First Corinthians 7 verse 1 2. now concerning the things there of you writing to me it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife my girlfriend why I let every woman have her own husband now just don't touch you don't have plenty of time to do that when you're married amen plenty number five holding hands look what James says verse James 1 12-16 blessed is the man that endures Temptation so you're going to be tempted you're gonna be tempted but when he has tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to them that love him let no man say when he's tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempted to any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and in Christ let me stop right here it's not bad for that to happen yeah if you cut it off right because you're going to be that it's just telling you that's what's going to happen right you're going to endure Temptation in other words it's not going to be one trial right it's going to be several all right and in price then when left unless have conceived it reinforced sin look at the stages that it's going through and sin when it is finished bringing forth death right do not air my beloved brethren we know that's in the spiritual but it's also in the natural also man you're going to be tempted girls and boys we're even tempted as male as older people yeah yeah but every man is tempted when he has drawn away of his own lust and it nice cut the thing off showing the very appearance of evil all right so now let's go to number nine let's see what brother Brown says about this women young women coming in and these men kissing these women don't you do that don't you you keep away from there you remember that if she's young single or whatever she is she'll be somebody's wife someday and you haven't gotten no business doing that stay away from her you want to greet her then be a Son of God shake her hand and say how do you do sister and let that settle it right there see right stay away from these things it's filth and it'll soon get you in trouble when lust is conceived it brings forth Sin Sin when it's finished brings forth what death all right if you want a greeter Shake Your Hand and it'll soon get you into trouble you just oh that's just sin is so easy it's so appetizing so pleasant listen folks this is the most appetizing and pleasure seeking world has ever been since a dawn of time you say well I can't help it God's put you here for a purpose he puts you here to help it amen he puts you here to have somebody stand In a Pulpit or somebody raise you as a child to tell you these things that you can overcome you can't you look out and have those people slop around with each other Lord we see it every day women don't care they have kids with anybody that want to and the man sleeps in anybody it's just Dog Eat Dog brother I'm said that I left that cold out but brother I remember he said dog eat dog but not a Christian right we're supposed to be separate it's so easy to fall right into it the best thing to do the very even appearance of it stay away from it get back be a real Christian of it all right number six in hugging remember what we said we pulled up the article in 2008 for those of you that weren't here in 2008 they ran an article in a paper showing that how the even the saliva and the man's lip in the glands in the lips and brother Brown we thought he was crazy when he said the sex glands was in the lips because we all knew they were somewhere else you know we all knew that but science has proven that kissing releases hormones we read the article we won't read it now but we read the article there where the kissing releases hormones and the hormone starts an aphrodisiac and for those of you that are older you know what that is those of you that's younger you'll learn about it when you get older and yeah ask your mom and Danny hey these things are not supposed to be only talked about in church you're supposed to be doing it at home right right amen let's be doing that at home don't depend on your pastor that's the problem with teachers people depend on teachers and schools to be the to be the parent and this and that and the other and the babysitter no I knew one thing's for sure brother Collins if I got a weapon at school I got one at home and I told them we didn't live under the Constitution United States in my house the Constitution said you were innocent until proven guilty in my house you are guilty until proven innocent and then they'd even usually get to the innocent party because we knew we needed it anyway but we did get a few maybe that we didn't need but it all equals out but we knew one thing for sure that if we misbehave in school we were going to get it at home because homes where it's supposed to start all right questions and answers brother Brown talks about kissing and hugging is it right for Christian men and women to kiss one another oh on greeting no sir no indeedy no sir you kiss one woman brother that's your wife they are or your child or you know whatever in other words you're you know it's okay kiss your sister on the cheek or something but wife child family that's it is it right for let me see if I got that right is it right for Christian men and women to kiss one another on greedy no sir no indeedy don't you never get that started yes sir no sir you keep away from women shine away from them exactly right now they're our sisters but don't know they got that that that thing even got over in Pentecost and it's called free love when you do get anything like that you stay away from it that's right I don't care how clean you are you're my brother and I believe that you're you might be a good Sanctified holy man I don't care how holy you are you're still a man I don't care how old she is she's still a woman stay away from it until you're married you just do that remember the body I'm going to speak double now so that your older people will understand it's a mixed group but I'm your brother and this is the question see each human being male and female have a different type of gland female has a female Glam sex Glam male has a male gland sex Clan and these lands land in human lips we wondered how in the world but science proof that kissing relief something that made the other two parts work okay everybody understand just let's go through that and here's another thing that might be brought up man kissing one another in the mouth that's dirty that's filthy and what he does he starts homosexual stay away from that he just stay away from kissing you kiss her enough when you're married to her and I promise you she probably won't thank you yes or not once you marry him yeah yeah sisters sisters amen all right so you know you can get all that going when you get married all right number seven on occasion well this is pretty self-explanatory brother Dale's been through this talking to us about marriage and divorce this kind of all fits together First Corinthians 6 18 flee fornication ever seen that a man doeth is without the body but he that commits fornication sent us against his own body what no you're not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own for your Bot with a prize therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which is God your body yeah God owns this body right amen right and in spirit which regards first Thessalonians 4 3-5 for this is the will of God this is the will of God you want to be in the will of God do this right even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupences even as the Gentiles which no not God and just like president was talking about when when um Paul was talking to the Gentiles trying to bring him over into Christianity they didn't know that's right five four or five wives and one guy was living with his mother-in-law and you know things like that were going I mean living with his stepmother and things going on like that Paul had to come in and bring this down and tell them in Thessalonians hey I'm staying from that stop it right don't you know your body's a temple of the Holy Ghost so you're not yeah you're defiling things that that well we'll read it next one invisible Union listen sisters and brothers too that brother Brown talks about sisters let's read it marriage is the oldest institution in the world marriage was performed first and instituted in the Garden of Eden a woman is interested with certain characters that she must not defile a woman is trusted to that there's not a creation creature on earth like a woman there's no female dog no female of any kind interested with the character that a woman is does everybody understand what he's talking about amen a female dog a couple of times a year she goes into her cycle she gets pregnant she has babies right a human woman anytime reading marriage and divorce she can be had any time or she can give herself away at any moment she doesn't have to wait to the cycle just for her children as everybody understand what I'm talking about right okay all right look but a woman was not even in the beginning of the creation because God knows that she would fall all other females could not commit adultery she's the only one that can commit adultery why because she can say yes and no right she is the only one who can commit adulthood if she had been made like the original that would have been this complementary to God's great wisdom see he was made a byproduct of a man but because she was cast over on that side she has also been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption right for Redemption amen because you got to get us here before we can be redeemed amen just to be honest right we had to come through the womb of a woman born in sin Champion he lost so to make we can be redeemed how we redeem then we become The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ we'll talk about that in a minute for Redemption she's got characters that she must not defile if she would more than she'd defiled for a lifetime know how much no matter how much she's forgiven she can't be justified I'll strike that in a little bit not a scripture in a few minutes she can be forgiven for her defilement but she cannot be justified in this life you understand what I'm talking about you cannot turn a virgin back if she was a virgin she went out and had an act she can't be restored and ever say she was a virgin again does everybody understand that right same way with the male male's the same way male's got a virgin emergency too but she's entrusted with one because she's got to bring human life through through that vessel everybody understand her body is giving her it's not wait got a scripture on that but she cannot be justified in this life it's always weather notice now she's been given this she may be forgiven so he can be forgiven but you can't be justified in other words you can't come up to a man after you've been defiled you can't come up to a man that you really want to marry and say honey I'm a virgin and you're not you can't that can't be restored back that's what he's talking about this is all in the natural he's come back she can be forgiven but not be justified in what she's doing her body's giving her a sacred Trust From God no female dog no bird no other animal no other creature like that no she is the only one buy it she is the reason it's so sacred she is to bring forth life into the Earth her body is abandoned ground of life right Banning ground of life therefore that's the reason she is given this sacred trust and here's where you may disagree with theologians but that's what defiled the whole human race is that adultery in the beginning her bedding ground was smart she brought fourth twins came the name but one act two children search the scripture all right now let's go to Galatians 6 be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man sowing not showing also read for he to soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption always I'm not trying to change scripture but always right you reap to the flesh you'll always going to read correction because what this flesh is corruption but he that saw it to the spirit shall of the spirit re life Everlasting I love that scripture some of you children you may want to keep these things and keep them in your keep them in your Bible or keep them um if I was a young guy growing up now and I was in church I would post these all over my uh car and and all over my uh bedroom and wherever just to remind me and God's telling us something here because once we're defiled we're defiled you can be forgiven there is Grace that's what we're going to talk about right here there is Grace so any of you males or females that's been in here that that have that have not done right and been defiled there is Grace but there's certain things that you can and cannot do right right Isaiah 118 says come down and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be a Scarlet there's only one sin that can't be forgiven and that's blasphemy right yeah brother Brown said many times the prostitute had been turned into a Christian woman but now remember she can't walk up to a man and say I'm a virgin she can't marry a preacher yeah surf like that but she can be a Christian woman or a Christian man don't let it be so shameful that you can't be saved or Satan will say ah you you're all ready to fall yeah it might be defiled because of you buddy Satan but I got that scripture right there though your sins be a Scarlet they should be as wide as snow don't they be red like Crimson they shall be as well that's what God says about us if you're truly forgiven you're forgiven all right man but I can't remember it but you're going to remember and you're going to live with it that's why I say children don't go in this the way that some of us have went because you're going to remember and it's going to haunt you for the rest of your life Satan has that one little thing he can sit there and he pound you with don't do it and you know what you can walk up and say Neville I might do a lot of other things but that's not I'm not going to follow my body my body's going to stay yes a temple of the Holy Ghost right all right if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from anything that we did that went right is that what he says and cleanse us from all all means all in God he heals all of our diseases brother Eddie there's none of disease God can't I can't heal from there's not a sin that God can't make us righteous except for blasphemy we're not talking about that we're talking about the grace of almighty God we know about the grace of marriage and divorce but you know what I like what daddy said the other Sunday when we were gone I was listening to that the other day it's not the grace of marriage and divorce it's the Grace from marriage and divorce yeah from it yeah the grace run marriage and divorce because some people don't have a natural marriage and divorce problems right if you've never even defend divorced you can just say I never had a marriage problem you understand if y'all if your husband's dead you marry again if you've never been married to anybody you don't have you you don't have to have the grace of marriage and divorce for a lot of the human things you do or if your wife went out and committed adultery you put her away and marry again right amen and be not covered under the grace of marriage and divorce that's covered I don't know what the Bible tells you to be good right gracious marriage and divorces for something you've already done wrong and God gives you Grace for that all right Grace from the what the law of marriage and divorce all right everybody understand I hope you got that that was really good a couple Sundays ago of course good every Sunday but that was a good one right just one little word Grace from Grace from marriage in divorce you take that Grace from that and then you go on as you are don't do it anymore all right now here's a few things that we can do on don't on dudes this might help a lot of things if you'll start every day with a prayer of course you know what I start every day with a prayer that's right start every day with a prayer you see counsel for things you're having trouble with yeah you know why because we've been there yeah remember what I said before we've been there done that had you for it let me say it one more time we've been there done that and had you yeah all right so we've been through all that you see Council for things you're having trouble with do ask permission before dating someone do things in group number five I just want to make sure you got that on there do talk talk no texting no I know you you laugh about but you know why in this social media world that we're in Facebook and all the other junk and I say junk call this junk you know why it's junk because it's gossip it's something you can say to somebody and not have any feeling you you've pulled yourself back that's why I hate it I want to converse with a human I want to look at my bald eyeball because you know what there's things that men brother colleague even will say to each other texting or on Facebook that we wouldn't say to each other I bought eyeball we come so detached in this world we think oh we got to have this social media we may have to have it in certain places but it has nothing to do with this guy I mean what are you doing same way with God you know you you hide behind all these things you hide behind this computer you hide behind this this telephone well there ain't a telephone anymore it's a little computer it just rings every once in a while reminds you this still a telephone all right but really you'll say things and you'll text things that you wouldn't say in person that's right am I telling the truth pan over there pan out there am I telling the truth amen I want the world to know that we're telling the truth here perfectly we're telling the truth there's things that you would do on that machine that you'd never do face to face right no I want face to face because you know what then I can truly tell you how I feel and you can't hide behind right numbers our screen that's true come on people that's true we've detached ourselves from all this we're supposed to be what have Fellowship all right Fellowship one with another do have clean fun there are things you can do to have fun while dating but remember this dating stage is the important stays because you've honed into one person and you're talking to them amen oh and do number seven because you won't do a lot of it after you get married listen yeah hello anybody that's right are you listening Collective hearing you get after about 30 years Amen to that everybody's hands now look number eight new hold hands only after the engagement rings on the finger when you're engaged you've already asked the vowel's done you're just as good as married but look I left that part out where brother Dale was talking about the other day my brother Brown said now that don't mean you can start living together right husband and wife filthy living brother said we don't want none of that you got to take on the name you got to get married you got to do that before the people you gotta exchange the vows yeah I want you just want to start texting bowels to each other how about that yeah see how in didn't that make you feel that made you feel kind of weird because that's impersonal when you're standing there looking at that person and you're having the same in sickness and in health and all that other stuff you're looking at it right here in the face will you marry me yeah no you do it through a loud voice all right but look look at number nine I wish I would have done this because if I'm going to be a Christian this is where I should be do make church Sunday school and bible study priority not an option amen right right not an option make it a priority that we stay in church we stayed in Sunday school we stay in Bible study we do these things together um you know I just uh Gabby and and Ryan just to me they make I don't know I can't explain it I just enjoy them seeing them together I enjoyed seeing them together remember you I have a hard time seeing us Ryan and Gabby they come to uh they come Sunday still they're there whether their kids are screaming or not you know they don't make an excuse you understand what I'm saying they don't make an excuse to be a bible study on on Saturday night one Saturday night a month one Saturday night a month they're always saying even when they first got married and didn't have children all the way up right yeah you know why because it's a priority to them not an option right same way with you and I should be a priority not an option right because I need you know the Bible said I was telling about Richard now in Tennessee last weekend the Bible says for sake not the symbol of himself together well now we say well you need to be in church that's right but read the rest of it he says and more right right we must not be looking for the day to approach the way we miss church around here and everywhere else they haven't every it's not in this church it's in every other church too and more the Bible says as the day approaches so in other words if you missed Church 30 times last year you ought to just miss it 20 this year do you want to miss right I mean let's just be human about this thing he says and more the Bible says and more as the day approach it right come together right come in because hey what did I read you what brother Brown said the other day we were talking about um who shall declare his generation brother Brown said you can't get stronger in miss church remember the prophet said that now if you're if you're that way you can just get mad at him not me all right all right because brother Brown said you miss church you will get weaker right right right you will get weaker so you're getting weaker if you miss church don't even look around nobody else Lose Yourself right I am getting weaker that's what you probably said so we'll just you know y'all don't talk to him about it all right all right let's go now to marriage we've got about 15 minutes and 32 pages left now when we get married listen first Peter 3 1 7 likewise you wise being subjecting to your own husbands if any obey not the word they also may be without the word being won by the conversation of the wives right let's just stop right there and save time let's go to number 30. and we'll talk about the Battle here just for a second go to the next one brother Anderson thank you numbers 30 verse 2-5 the man battle to the Lord and swearing oath to bind his soul with a bind he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth if a woman also bow bow into the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her Youth and her father hear her vow and her bond for which she has bound her soul her father shall hold his peace in her then all her vows shall stand and Never Bound for when she was bound her soul she'll stand we'll explain this in just a second but if her father disallows her and the day that he hear it not any of her vows or any of her bonds for which she has bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed reason being just like brother Brown did with his child the two sisters a few vowels and say yes I'll marry that boy and and the father you come and tell the father that day if he see something wrong with this situation he can say uh no that that won't happen because remember your father is your Holy Ghost until you get the Holy Ghost right your father's your head until you become under the headship of your natural husband everybody understand that right so you fathers you can you can look at this situation and you can say no and that would make her where her vowel wouldn't stand and she's okay because she's protected by you right right if you say no you can't marry that boy and she's already said it now she may go on and do it but you've told him no right because of a certain situation if you disallowed in the day now not six months later when you find out he might have a problem all right or he sorry and can't work and all these other things you can't say no no you gotta you gotta look that have spiritual eyes and you know what to me that to me that's Grace that's the grace of God that you can do that right and be clean because look and the Lord shall forgive her right right in other words like it never happened right right take this into spiritual there's a lot of battles we made in this in our spiritual life right God hears it and disallows it that's the only way we can be forgiven is our father Our Father our vows right there's a lot of things we bound to do out in the world that's right that we've got real bad shape over yeah but God disallowed when he give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he disallowed along their mouths right okay so we can go spiritual with that too but let's say in our natural because that's a good thing for for the for the girls to know that that uh if the father says no Then You're not bound to that guy right because he makes you something you don't see right right he may see something you don't see and then if you take correction and say hey I'm sorry then you're not bound to that guy it's not that you vowed that you're going to marry him and you're stuck I think that's great right I think that's wonderful that God put that in there Deuteronomy 23 21. when thou shalt bow into the Lord thy God Thou shalt not slack to pay it for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee and it would be sin in me so if you vow vow into the Lord and you're gonna stick to it you better not be slack about it you pay that amount you're going to marry that boy you're going to marry that girl you better do it Genesis two and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathing in his Knoxville is the breath of life and Man became a living soul now why did he just keep doing that we'll get to that in the family part brother Brown asked that question why didn't God just keep doing that why'd he just keep making it Out of the Dust of the Earth he was a father he wanted Adam to be a father he wanted a family Adam and Eve made the family we'll get into that in just a second or maybe this afternoon Genesis 2 18. listen this and Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him and help meat for him now we'll get into that in just a second we got a definition for that remember laughs and out of the ground the Lord formed every beast of the field every foul there and brought him unto Adam to see what he would call him whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all the cattle now remember he made male and female cows he made male and female horses male and female dogs right Adam give them you know give them their name and Adam gave names for all cattle for all the air never beast of the field but for Adam it was not fail to help me for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out a man what is what is the word woman it's man with a womb right right woman Whoa man all right she was a woman she was a man with a womb because she was taken out of Adam therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now listen that's what I said before in the end time sister Collins now they're leaving their life and cleaving to their father and mother they're all moving back home now yeah now you're married until you die right you leave your father and mother and cleave be your wife don't leave your wife and cleave your parents again all right that's not what God intended all right now next with God through reconciliation the prophet said but God laid down a program in the oh God had a plan wow God had a plan but God laid down a program in the beginning how that man can have Fellowship one with another yeah and we'll have to come to God's terms on that that's all you got to come to God's term that's what he wanted AI in the beginning when man used to walk in the early ages with God in the Garden of Eden when the first Man was created in the great Cathedral Cathedrals Under The Palms he and his wife went in the cool of the evening come along they came out and worshiped God had a perfect Fellowship God Longs for Fellowship he yearns he wants people to speak with him to talk with him all right let's go to the next one now you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God and God Longs for his creature who he created in His image to fellowship with him wouldn't you loved and lived in that time when the Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden could come down in the cool evening and talk with him and fellowship with him wouldn't that be marvelous we all would like to have that time now I Believe by God's word I can prove to you that we can come right back let me read this again now I Believe by God's word I can prove to you that we can come right back on them terms again with God tonight tonight he brought it from Adam and Eve to the very present day he was preaching tonight right straight back to that kind of Fellowship amen right now here's the first Covenant we'll get into that and just right here because the first Covenant God made was what God said Genesis 2 15 18. the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden's address and keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest free to eat now where was he where was woman inside of Adam when God told him this right he hadn't separated them yet she was still inside of him right and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree in the garden thy man is freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof Thou shalt surely die and then what God say and then God said it's not good that a man should be alone I will make him and help me for him he goes on and tells him here's the Covenant you do this you'll live you don't do this you'll die right that's the first Covenant right we'll end right here on this one where the fellowship was broken remember what happened we know what happened in the garden I don't have to read now Genesis 3 14 and the Lord God said unto the serpent cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou on go and thus shall they eat all the Days of Our Lives now here's where the fellowship was broken and now we'll put enmity between thee and the woman enmity is division God was separating us from him right no Fellowship like it used to be God couldn't come down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with him anymore because we're reading just a few minutes what this new covenant contains and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed he shall breathe thy head and thou shalt bruises heal see that covers the whole Plan of Redemption there but that's what he done for man he stopped the fellowship that they used to have before this fall now Genesis 3 16. here's where the New Covenant comes in all right until the woman he said I would greatly multiply I sorrow my conception see because we have to cover this for those of you that were here before we've always heard brother Brown talk about what the woman did and what the man did and why the woman was this part and a man with this part right but I've always been somebody remember what what did I tell you I've always been the kind of person I want to know the why why has a woman got to be under suggestion to a man why is a man gonna act like he acts why is a woman gonna act why is that electricity work like he does you understand from back what we're talking about why because I'll have no fear and I'll know how to handle things if I understand it better all right I just don't want and don't get me wrong I just don't want the profit to tell me do's and don'ts right right right this message is not do's and don'ts amen right right this message was Grace it was brought there are things inside there that we shouldn't do and he tells us what we should do and shouldn't do just like I'm telling you that but I want to know the wine because the why is the revelation there's Seven Seals broke right I want to know why not that they well they just broke it was time for it well why why why did it break what's the purpose behind it breaking what's the purpose what has it got to do with me right all right same thing with this until the woman he said I would greatly multiply that I sorrow my conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children so here children is going to be brought in in this way in sorrow and in conception and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee the voice of my life and after eating of the three of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat cursed is the ground for thy sake right right sorrow thou shall eat of it all the days of thy lives Thorns also in thistle shall they bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herds of the field in a sweat of my face shall thou eat bread till thou return us to the ground for out of it was now taken for dust Thou Art yes Thou shalt return all right let's go to number 12. we'll kind of stuff right here and pick us up this afternoon imagine divorce here we see brother Brown says two Covenants now that closes the beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't so at the beginning when Jesus told those those Pharisees it wasn't so from the beginning he's talking about the beginning before there was a fall right right when man and woman one man one woman right right but now we have two Covenants the Covenant that they broke and now second Covenant that they come under that God's telling them what to do we got another Covenant now notice it's another Covenant and there's a covenant for the product and the byproduct because remember they were the same under the first Covenant right so why does a woman have well she was in the fall she had she did I gotta know a little more than that the fall brought trouble death to every creature of the creation making a difference in all nature now let us notice what Jesus said about it from the beginning it was the soul now it is not so from and it's now it is after the beginning see that it is now it is after the beginning and there is a double Covenant first was just the Covenant Adam and Eve was co-lequal does everybody understand that Adam and Eve before the fall there was no this and then they were co-equal co-equal because that's what we're coming back to co-equal remember the Bible says word heirs and join heirs with Christ right right all right so now now the world first first was just the Covenant Adam and Eve of co-equal one man one woman now the woman sinned and what does she do that threw them all to death because remember Adam could have said no he took on her sin right all right we'll talk about that a little later now the woman's saying that throw them all to death and God had to make a covenant buy that another Covenant here it is here in Genesis 3 16 he made another Covenant now the world is to be repopulated not by the regional creation of God like in the beginning not by the original creation but by sex desire now that takes care of the beginning doesn't it because we were all supposed to be word-born children right yeah right right spoken word children not sex never was supposed to be sex right folks have been spoken word all right Michael that's the way we're being born now spiritually we we're being born by the spoken word of God right amen the seed is not a natural seed of of sperm now it's it's the word is the seed that's right all right right here the word is the seed that will repopulate the Whirlwind now we're repopulating the World by sex desire out here but God's repopulating his world his people his children by the spoken word right man don't understand that right that's right men don't understand that they don't and they'd be born again because that's what it is right right please sample now the world is being repopulated not by the original creation of God like in the beginning not by the original creation but by sex desire now that takes care of the beginning doesn't it in the beginning there was only one man one woman one male one female and when she crossed that line and brought this sin now the world is being repopulated Again by sex not by creation my sex see where the woman is at now but that's the way the world is populated today through women that's the reason Jesus had to come through the woman right right to bring it back to its original beginning again without sex desire he is Virgin born but Hallelujah there will come a time where it won't be no more sex but God shall call his children from the dust of the Earth back like they was in the original not through any woman but through the molding of the clan the cosmic light and petroleum he will create again like he did Adam at the first time Jesus made this possible by giving God himself a man by God making himself a man and coming to the world so we could die through this woman now it's the testing Time by saying this is our testing time right here look at this all right number 13. now notice now after the beginning after the beginning After Time began back in that was The Eternity is is over in other words we're in time now notice after that fall was made by Eve after the fall there was need to be another covenant made now this is going to Stone with you but I'm going to give you scripture to prove that this is true now notice after the fall Jesus said God at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall now we're going beyond that the Covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there's another coming up made now she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant right everybody understand that man now we're going to stop right there and that way I'll pick back up right here but what happens is now it's right at 12 o'clock now what you had Adam and Eve coequal now you've got what you've got Adam we're gonna read in Ephesians where what Christ is the head of the man man is the head of the woman right right but we're going to see that that's why it had to be that to bring us back to Redemption because it had to come through the woman that's how we all got here Jesus hadn't even come to a woman but it wasn't my Sexes all right was what be it unto me according to Thy Word the egg and The Germ was planted the baby came with no sex desire what creation spoken word remember he's the beginning of the creation of God right Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God what the beginning is how it should have been had they not been a fall right my son we'll pick up right there this afternoon and go on to the man and the woman in the family does everybody understand now we're under the double Covenant the double Covenant you say well that puts a woman in a lower place no one puts her in a good place stay in your position hey where you're supposed to be yeah let's sing one song and then we'll then we will dismissed for for a little time and come back our second service you love the Lord amen I know this is kind of redundant but maybe kind of help I know I forget things so I have to get somebody to tell me that over again because some of you probably forgot some of these quotes because I did too looking back over and we're only human we only get so much that's why it took so long for God to get us where we're at because we have to hear things over and over again because we're human right there's nothing wrong with that you know what the problem is sometimes we don't make ourselves available for God to give us what he's already getting but he's already got it laid out there right the plan's already late the plan's done the plans finished we just got to come under that plan just like the woman had to come under the headship of the man we have to come under the headship of Christ's problem is probably is we still got a lot of females wanting to be males you know not a male's acting acting a female that's the way it is because brother Brown I'm gonna find it this afternoon I'm gonna find it back there but we miss it in the walk our walk right that's where we're missing it I've told you many times before and I'm going to tell you again forget about the seal if you're not born again right right forget about marriage and divorce and I'm telling Brother Richard Brother Richard Wilson now let me tell you this one thing let me tell you dad and I were talking about it there's not one period there's not one letter there's not one number of marriage and divorce should ever be spoken to anybody but born again Christian right ever never talk to nobody about it never it's not for those people right is for believers only like I said there's not a period and I'm and I'm saying this you know but the Bible says don't cast your pearls before swines all right why they'll eat them it doesn't no good you think you're being so spiritual forget it stop it it's only for born-again people only Brother Ray is that right that's strong enough don't talk about marriage and divorce to anybody they don't understand it you're just a stumbling block right what brother Dale's preaching shouldn't go out to the world they don't understand it amen he said this is to my people only right the people that believe this message so forget about it you're not doing anybody any good that's right by talking about marriage and divorce that's right you know don't ask me a question about ain't Sally is she all right no she's not because she ain't born again yeah that's what makes her not right right get born again then we talk about all these other things right I mean get born again let's do the primer thing let's walk into a building and people know that we're a Christian amen let's walk into our office and people know that you're a Christian right right walk into your everyday Walk of Life they say that's a Christian right right praise God they may not like my father as him as other siblings but they know he's a Christian that's right right and they'll tell you that he practices what he believes now they may not can say that about his other brother that's a preacher his other brothers it profess Christianity but they say it about that man why because he's walked in front of them to me that's the most that's more powerful than than knowing what seal number four is yeah right right exactly because it's it's what we project right the only God they're ever going to see is us so quit walking the line all of us stay away let our conversation be clean right always not just every once in a while yeah not just every once in a while right always we come down to the time where I know we get we have to be forgiven every day yeah but there should be some little things that we're still doing that ought to be done buried you know what the problem is they're not dead that's right you're not dead you just divorced them you just left one church and come to this one yeah you just divorced it put it over here somewhere but remember somewhere down the line it'll raise us ugly head up right sure but if you kill it it don't resurrect don't think resurrections Christians right not Sinners sure they'll resurrect later on right I'm talking about the Glorious Resurrection where you'll change our body let's sing one song 539 is probably what I'm saying created me a queen okay we're gonna sing one time if you have a need if you don't the second time we sing it just going back go out of the church and go eat you about but if you have a need I don't want to close without somebody coming up for prayer desire and renewable s hey you were experience I don't have anything anymore thank you every new York me
