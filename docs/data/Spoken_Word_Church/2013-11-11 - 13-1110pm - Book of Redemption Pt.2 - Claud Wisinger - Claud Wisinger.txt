========================================

it's been a special day for me sterling's birthday he got a ziggle this week and it keeps getting better not that i get sing today but tomorrow is jan and i's 19th wedding anniversary i had a song i've been working on for three months but my car's been the shop two months now so when i get it back out i'll go back to work on a glorious day it's a wonderful song amen but i'm gonna sing this what i was saying rapture if we never meet again earth my precious friends and if to god you have been true and you've lived above all sin there is going to be a meeting yes there's going to be a greeting i'll see you in the rapture some sweet days i'll see you in the rapture i'll see you in the rapture i'll see you at that meeting in the air there with our blessed savior we'll live and reign forever do my loved ones let me sing is so get ready now to meet him with his the message some sweet days stand with me let's sing it out amen believe it i'll see you in the rapture i'll see you in the rapture i'll see you at that meeting there with our blessed savior the i'll see you at that meeting some sweet days amen and amen and amen amen see you in the rapture we were supposed to take up an offering for the uh brother in the philippines but what happened uh brother al called me and then they got on the internet system that they would not let him leave the hospital unless that they had the money for you know payment or something so what we done is we went ahead and sent the money to them earlier this past week you know that way we could get it to them where they could help them so we sent two thousand dollars to the two brother siriano there and you know the family whatever they could get him out of the hospital because they said he let him out of the hospital and all but they weren't going to let him out till he paid the bills so they would let him out and then i think now that they said there was going to be about three months six months or something he would have to go back and have uh bypass surgery or something to be done but we went ahead and sent that now so we didn't take it up today but if you want to put any in just put it in the offering plate you know because it all goes and just lay at an offering plate and just say well that's that was for that and it all goes together anyway so just remember that amen and they mentioned terrence did about the the philippines but the narcissist called the other day and was asking us to pray for him during the time of that typhoon or whatever going through and i don't know how everything's turned out what it's doing but just keep praying for those people over there that uh you know wind up uh losing everything in the world and all like that just keep them in your prayers but how so just remember all of these keep them in your prayer amen you enjoy the message this morning looking forward this afternoon to the word of the lord so let's just sing and ask god to come and speak to us because that's what we believe will happen today right he speaks to his ministry so remember that okay open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i want to see do you i would then listen to the word open the eyes of my heart open the eyes remember now the watch night service that brother timothy burdette will be preaching to watch night service here for us you remember that remember the other announcements that are made shining in the light of your morning oh hey man that's wonderful i love that song you guys i wish you could uh come back with me for a couple weeks in oklahoma we have about 35 in our congregation i have a man who leads songs for me but he's not really a song leader you guys have three of them here you guys i you guys oughta you got to realize how blessed you are i don't even have somebody in my church that's qualified to be a deacon and that's something i mean you guys i'm telling you you here ought to really thank god i think you take it for granted what you got here really and uh it's just it's a privilege to come here and i'm a little envious when i come i see all these people he says there's new people coming in oklahoma it's just a prairie out there it just there's 83 churches in bartlesville it's 38 000 people and it's it's the most burnt off place you'll ever see and it just we just don't get many we'll get a visitor here and then and boy they don't usually show up much maybe it's a preacher i don't know but uh but it's tough you know it really is but uh and i tell the church even at our church i don't really think we have the full essence of what we really have as a group of people uh we we just don't understand what what what how god has been so gracious to us in this hour i mean all the sages and all the prophets wanted to live in this hour did you know that right if you would ask paul or any of the great prophets of old where they wanted to live they just said lula georgia did you know that they wanted to sit right here with you in this hour because there's something really great that's happening and sometimes i think we take these things for granted as people and it just like i told the words in the church i can't put into english words what he's done for me i can't explain it can anybody explain it i just can't explain it i just i know it by experience i know what he's done for me and i just someday i hope to have the words where i could utter it you know to show him how much i appreciate we'll go to the scriptures now and we'll go to revelation 10 we all know these scriptures we quote them uh we probably know most of these by heart don't we but we're going to go through it again and just and let me read it for you and i saw another mighty angel does everybody understand brother graham said an angel is a ministering spirit right so we understand that this mighty angel come down brother branson said only christ it could be amen what is that it was a a spirit a ministering spirit to come to the earth and this ministering spirit that came to the earth did and it was christ so everybody i hope understands that brother ham said it was christ brother ram told us who it was and he came as a ministering spirit okay and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open that right like i told the church a little book few there be that find it it's not a this is not a great big book right few there be that find this one a little book open and he set his right foot upon a sea and his left foot up on the earth he cried with a loud voice as one of ryan lyon roarth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when he had be and when the seven thunders and do you realize this is the only place thunders is mentioned right here right there so the thunders the seven thunders are associated with this seventh church age messenger you go out there's not one one luther none of them preached on the thunders you can't find any preacher ever that have preached on the thunders okay can i tell you that find it i'll challenge you i went out the internet i did thunders i looked through you can't find it because thunders is associated with this seventh church the mighty angel and the seven church age messengers does everybody agree with that okay so you won't find it nowhere in history before this will you find where it's mentioned okay you just won't and when the seventh others had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered now he could write what he seen but he couldn't write what he heard is that brother brown made that plain to us he couldn't write what those voices uttered but he did write what he seen right and he wrote it in symbol form okay so when he wrote in symbol form it's still a mystery we have it written in the bible but it hasn't been revealed as of yet and write them not and the angel which i shall stand upon a sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that they're in and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer right can i can i tell you the mysteries are through when this mighty angel comes down the earthly angel seventh angel was on earth at that time there's no more time there's no more revelation does everybody understand that the mysteries are finished so it's up to us to pick up these mysteries and get out of here okay there's not another day to come there's you know there's not something another message to come it's finished exactly time's up you what you get out of this 17 earth church age messenger the seventh angel it's finished with him okay but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound not when he starts his ministry but when he begins to sound the mystery of god i'm going to say the mystery of the word is everybody okay with that should be finished it's over right there's nothing else to follow this as he hath declared made known to his servants the prophets let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word we pray that you'll be with us as we minister here tonight lord and may you help me move through it and keep the people's attention lord i know they're tired and i just pray lord you'll give him strength in this hour in jesus christ's name we ask it amen you can be seated what i want to do is continue on with the book of redemption it's like i told you in each time every time that you have an exodus prophet there's one theme that really sticks out and it's redemption there's a big there's redemption he's bringing you out of something into something right i told you i'm going to kind of go back just for a second but under the children of israel they knew him as jehovah before that that name jehovah was never known that's what it says go read in in i think six three of exodus exodus chapter six three it'll say he was my name is jehovah he was never known as jehovah before he was known as god almighty elohim jehovah's existing with his people is that right so the children of israel received something in that hours the fullness of the redemptive names of jehovah of the old testament okay when jesus came another exodus brought of it what did he reveal to the people the fullness of the godhead bodily so every time it talks about redemption there's a fullness that comes to the earth at that time in this hour what we've had is the mystery of god's finished does everybody understand that the fullness of the word has come you can't add to it you can't take away i can't add to it i can't take away it's the fullest the word has been given i can't i can't do it any better than brother branham did it what he does is like me you come back through it and break it all down into parts and at the end of your 28 you'll probably do a summary won't you most of the time you do usually at the last one you spread it out there and the last one i go down and try to bring it all together so that people will see all the parts of it see a lot of times redemption there's parts to it does everybody understand the third pool there's parts to it if i say that are you okay with that there's parts to it and so in this hour what i want what i wanted you to get we understand we're in an exodus we've had an exodus prophet we've had the fullness of the word the mystery of god's finished right but there's parts to that that what you're doing is you're breaking the parts down for them to where we can get a revelation from god right now does everybody understand that i hope i want to i want to show you something here when i say i preached on the book of life if i do something that's different to you you can go back and fix it won't you i know see this man what i like about him and i'm the same way i'm not afraid somebody will preach something wrong in my church now i don't bring somebody in that i know has false doctrine but if somebody comes and preached something wrong in my church i have taught my people well enough they'll catch it i have that kind of confidence right he has confidence if i say something wrong he'll fix it when i leave you might tell me at home now i hope he does because you know what if i'm wrong i want to be right is everybody that way am i heady and high minded brother bram said hitting highmind is know it all he said when you think you know it all you're wrong start over i don't know at all i only know what what's been given in this hour what god has revealed to me personally now do i think i'm going way up where this guy is not really i feel like a gnat compared to him i'll guarantee you i wish i'd been in it as long as you have preaching as long i'd be good at it i'm still practicing okay i'm going to be honest with you okay but i want to show you this is the book here okay oops you at least you could've gave me one at work okay i'm not a you can tell i'm not an artist either huh that's terrible don't you think i'm gonna put over here book of life i'm gonna put lamb's book of life on this side is that okay yeah give me a sharpie but does everybody understand it brother brandon when he talked about the and we call this this whole thing we'll either call it the lamb's book of life which is inclusive of all of it sometimes brother graham says book of life and he's inclusive of all of it right but when brother really gets the detail and breaks the parts down we understand that there's two parts to the book of life or vlan's book alive whichever way you want to say it that don't matter to me okay but i'm going to tell you the book of life over here you have people that are justified because over on the book of life remember in revelations it says that the book of life were opened and they were judged from the works that they did does everybody understand justification is a work of the holy ghost but it's works right right so people who are in this side of the book alive they're going to if they're just justified that they're going to be justified be judged by the works of justification do you agree you say yes you agree another one is sanctification sanctification is a work of grace does everybody agree with that now there's another group that you know what they're good to the bride and they got good works right because it says i'm going to say good to the bride then at the white throne the book of life is open does everybody understand what i'm saying now i'm going to tell you something the lamb's book of life it's done at the white throne it's over right do you agree and i'm going to tell you the difference between the book of life and the lamb's book of life the lamb's book of life is that people receive the fullness of the word in their hour luther received the fullness of the word in his hour the people that didn't receive that full message it was given in luther's day were on the book of life do you agree for good works they're going to be there brother and said at the white throne judgment multitudes will make it there that's why i told you this morning when you understand the book of life you'll have a different approach to people i don't know about you but i do because i'll be quite i don't know where your name is on there i know where my name is it's been revealed to me in chapter five john knew where his name was right that's why he was he knew the redeemer he knew where his name was i'm gonna be honest with you people sitting right here you know if you're just justified amen some of you know if you're not if you haven't come through sanctification yet right you know sure you know you know exactly where you're at right you're the only one who really does i don't know where my wife is to be honest as far as her spiritual part of it i believe she's on the lamb's book of life i believe that's all my heart i believe i got the right one you know who my right one is the one that's got the same revelation i do brother said don't marry an unbeliever under no circumstance he said if they don't if you're going to marry somebody they don't believe like you do don't marry them is that so hard for a message believer to believe that right geez the girls in our church man we got girls been married they're husbands we're a hooligan i mean you know you know what most women in the message think this is the only guy we're going to get it's the last chance right here no it's not god will bring you the right one through if you'll wait on him if israel would have waited they'd have got the right king they wouldn't have voted in saul just wait that's the hardest thing for christians to do wait so the book of life is those are justified sanctified and been good to the bride everybody agree with that and these over here they're the ones that received like i said i know i'm repeating myself fullness the word for their hour i'm going to put it that way so you'll understand is that right now brother branham said this he said adam does everybody understand adam had the book of life he said book of life didn't he when adam fell the book of life went back to the father exactly right amen and now i can it don't say it there but i can say it now that book was sealed with seven seals can i say that you're okay sure amen does everybody agree the book of life was sealed with seven seals right now i told you this morning what we call the book of redemption is not even mentioned in the bible so it's a mystery okay so what sealed this book up here can i say it is the book of redemption the mystery of redemption the plan of redemptions the way brother branham brought it right is everybody okay with that the plan of redemption for the hour luther was justification he seen the fullness of the word it proved he was here did everybody understand but the mystery of it hasn't been made known till this hour the thunders are the mysteries that was contained are the seals and the mystery look luther preached does everybody agree luther preached justification amen as if you've never done it i don't know about you guys but like brother i'm saying visible union greater portion justification under luther is as if you've never done it the mysterious part of it is i never did it so we go way beyond forgiving we never did it right brother said luther what he did he said well we're forgiven in other words we we remember what we did we're guilty of what we did but the justification in this hour the mysterious part of it the plan of redemption that's been opened in this hour of justification is it's a far greater portion than what luther had is that right we never did it the real you never ever did it right so what wraps this book up is seven seals what wrapped that thing up was the plan of redemption there was a fall in the garden he had the book but god had to come up with a plan so he sealed the book up with a plan if people met the plan in that hour then their name was on this side of the book right sure if they didn't know if they had good works you look loose judas had his name taken out of the book because why he rejected the word for his hour that right if the fullness of the word exists here in the church and you stay at justification now if you're truly justified and you just god don't give you the revelation of it you can make it there you can make it under brother man said also he said you can fall off at justification you can fall off in sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost you can't fall off there if your name's over here whatever age you were in you will receive the fullness of the word and i've told you redemption is the fullness of something it was the fullness of jehovah it was that name was revealed in jesus hour it was the fullness of the godhead bodily that was revealed to those people in that hour in this hour there's a fullness of the word that's come which is the mystery of redemption which is the planner redemption which is the book of redemption is everybody okay if i say it that way because like i say when i was looking at it i thought what is the book of redemption it's a mysterious book remember i told you that let me read the quote where brother brown said it that wasn't my quote it's his quote if i can find it amongst all this the reach between the seven church ages and the seven seals i don't know if he's got it i got i gave it to him at the last minute let me read it now but it is a book a mysterious book it's a book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while and now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood thoroughly understood it's probed at through the six church ages does everybody agree with that luther probed at it but it was all god gave him in that hour was justification as if he never died if he never did it brother ram said if luther would have lived on he'd have been right here with us like i told you this morning if luther and wesley would have lived on they'd have been sitting right here in lulu georgia or a message church just like does everybody agree with that because their name was on the lamb's book of life they will come to the fullness of the word i hope everybody understands what i'm saying it's probed that through six church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all of the loose ends that though these fellows probed at and the mysteries come down from god as the word of god is everybody okay with that exactly and reveals the entire the entire revelation of god right the mystery of god the entire fullest of the word will be made known in this hour right all the mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed brother brown when he opened the seals he said now we know the truth of serpent seed and i thought what was the mystery still around serpent seed does that make he preached in 59 did we understand serpent seed we thought we did well yeah i hear you we'll forgive you for that brother my daughter used to call him pedestrians instead of presbyterian she couldn't get that big word out so so i hope you understand this serpent seed whatever more will be revealed even brother branham when he preached serpent seat in 59 there's still some loose ends to it right because why the mystery of redemption the book of redemption was not totally open yet in its entirety does everybody agree with that now brother branham could absolutely explain the book of life the lamb's book of life fullness of the word all these things now he can explain them now that's exactly right right it could become a revelation to us because why the entire book was open it was the fullness of the word so like i say now that we understand there's a fullness you you you know there's an exodus but you ought to be the thing that's going to get you out of here is the fullness of the word the mysteries is what it is going to get you out of here and if you say mystery around some churches they don't want you to preach it here message churches are that way you go to them you know what they want they want you to hug them and tell them how much you love them and i believe you all love them but the truth is what's going to set you free these mysteries made known as the fullness that's what redemption is all about that's what's going to take you in is these mysteries but you know they i i just oh preachers i'm like moses i'm like jesus when it comes to preachers i practically lose my mind thinking about it don't you don't it don't it what what's your biggest problem preachers what's my biggest problem preachers it's the truth preachers that's my big problem okay better get off that i'll preach a whole message on preachers i preached it one time i put i put the title preachers and a question mark behind it is that a fair message i question a lot of them okay so we and another thing that when i started doing this book of redemption all the pieces started getting together on me the third pull the thunders the seals all these things started coming together and i thought wow i never realized how really connected everything is and there's different parts to it can i say it that way i want to read something brother brown said let's see here i got two of them how did i get two of them anyway let me read it anointed one's at the end time notice the very day with this messenger now not when he starts but when he begins to declare his message the first pool healing second full prophecy remember i told you what that was there's a voice in those two don't you ever forget it they speak amen right third pool the opening of the word right so brother branham is identifying what the third pool is he said the third pull is the opening of the word does everybody agree with that it's pretty easy when you read uh revelation 10 7 it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god well the mystery of some is unknown if god's going to declare something and give a revelation it's the opening of the word right so i can without a shadow of a doubt i can take revelation 10 7 to declare to you that's the third pool is that okay it's the opening of the word is that right mysteries revealed but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word that's why i went to malachi 4 today the only way he can prove to you that brother branham is a prophet is by the word amen the word we use is this one that i read to you revelation 10 7 is a vindication of william branham does everybody understand that brother branham was vindicated in the word another one i can use this revel or saint luke 17 30. right the revealing of the son of man what is son of man it's a prophet amen what was revealing a prophet has been revealed in this generation as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of sodom is that what the scripture says remember what happened in sodom there was a discernment given what happened in this hour that discernment shows you we're in the days of sodom we're at the end of the gentile dispensation is what it's telling you by the word there's a revealing of the son of man in this hour god has thoroughly revealed this prophet and this hour had vindicated him in the word that's why i wanted to read to you malachi 4. these guys that go off on the internet you've been in a message 30 years and go off what they look at is brother branham the natural part of him and that's why i told you look the natural part of brother man was a failure the natural part of moses of failure but you show me thus saith the lord the word where he was off they won't come to that they nitpick this little thing this little thing but they can't nitpick thus saith the lord can they look my face rhino final resting place is in the word i see william branham not the name but i see the by the revelation i see brother brandon was the fulfillment of malachi 4. i see brother man it was the fulfillment of revelation 10 7. i see 10 1-6 was the mighty angel that come down a cloud a rainbow what come down in 1963 on sunset mountain a cloud is that right what is it what is a rainbow it's a covenant he said he was going to open it in the end time and he's done it god confirmed his word to us that's what that rainbow is it's a covenant that god made a promise that he's here to keep the promise right amen so brother branham was absolutely vindicated in the word okay so we understand the third pool is the opening of the word now that's what i was telling you about the three exodus prophets they all had a third pool the third poll was always the voice of the sign right right it was it was the voice is what it was right what is a voice it's a thunder all right did brother rem say it thunder's the voice of god amen so we've had the thunders in this hour did everybody understand that amen we've had the mysteries it's been revealed to a group of people okay i don't know why i got two of them i want to read something to you this will kind of blow your mind maybe not this guy preaches it so in the ephesian church that's what as daniel heard the seven thunders right we read that we read john heard them didn't write them you know daniel did what did daniel write what the sixth full purpose of daniel he heard the same thing right you mean he heard the same thunders he's heard the same redemptive plan of god yes that's why people they're not willing to take daniel's 70 week all it is is redemption to the jews that's right that's right that's what i was telling you this morning brother branham states that daniel heard the thunders amen so when daniel wrote the sixth full purpose of right right of gabriel right or sixth full purpose again whatever says it i'm so messed up but anyway does everybody understand that right well what is it it's redemption it's all it is it's thunders what is it's the mysteries he heard them daniel but he had to seal him up just like john did does anybody know daniel means judge you know he came on sunset mountain as a white wigged one do you know who wears a white wig a judge right what did he come as in this hour judge he's here right now the judge is here as daniel heard the seven thunders and forbidden and john heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with seven seals but in the days of these seals to be opened the mystery of god would be finished in other words god would be known to his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of god would be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries would open to the church is that what i said this morning in revelation chapter four there was one on the throne there was one door open once we got that then we got to go to chapter five the book of redemption does everybody understand that the open book right so once he thoroughly had vindicated and opened that up who jesus was now we could move to the mysteries right christ the mystery of god revealed it's like somebody told me the other day i said you know what happened in the third pool of jesus ministry he went down and preached to the lost souls right you know what he did he said i'm christ the mystery of god revealed sure that's what he preached didn't he he said i'm the one that abraham talked about i'm the one that noah talked about and you rejected it you were the lost souls that didn't take the word in your hour so he went right down there and preached christ the mystery of god revealed right that's exactly what he did okay let me see the next quote here uh in his presence 620909 i'm gonna start down or i'm never gonna well maybe and i hate to cut and paste quotes you know you get a quote i only need a little bit and i still can't do that it just drives me nuts and now we now we will just as soon as i can i will announce when we are going to start let me go down now i think if the lord willing i want to take the next time that we start on the seven seals of revelations and the seven natural seals and then if we got through it in time take the seven seals on the back of the book see now that may take a little time there's seven seals that's open there's seven plagues seven trumpets all those sevens and them seals we could take first but then on the back of the book is sealed with seven seals daniel heard the voice as the thunders voice of god thunder and was forbidden to write it god john was forbidden to write it but it was sealed on the back side of the book that is after all the mysteries of the book has been given out and revealed so i'm going to just sum this up if i can can i sum this up over here on the board to kind of get where i really want to go the book of redemption sealed this thing up does everybody understand it was the plan of redemption is what seals that thing up everybody agree with that that's what the book of redemption is it's the plan of redemption and the plan of redemption sealed all those names up that's what the book of redemption is okay we think of it as like a physical book that's not what he's talking about it's a mysterious book it's mysteries it's the plan redemption is what it is that's what sealed the book of life up okay so what happened was what was that he was going to open the book the plan of redemption to a group of people on the earth at the time of the seventh angel now look at it the first seal what did the first seal cover first two church ages didn't it so the the book of revelations we said was the book of redemption is that's one right the first thing brother man said first that has to be revealed is jesus christ the first chapter what does it do it reveals the deity of jesus christ the first thing you've got to see in this redemption that we're at now is who jesus is right go read it revelation 1 go read it see if it don't it's seven-fold personage of jesus christ amen doesn't it it reveals the fullness of jesus christ amen it tells you the redeemer okay the second one is the church ages the first four seals are for what the church ages so we know the mystery of how god's going to redeem people through the church ages the book of redemption was the plan how god was going to redeem him in the ephesian age the smyrna age all the way to laodicean age does everybody agree with that the first four seals apply to what the church ages the fifth seal applies to the jews who were blinded by the father does everybody agree with that the jews were blinded in part till the fullness of the gentile dispensation come in does everybody agree with that statement so the jews were blinded the only thing they could see the father so when the jews died from the time of calvary right until god goes back to the jews they're under the father's altar right for those first four seals now that fifth seal jesus christ comes to those that are under that altar the martyr seal remember i told you this last time i was here what does jesus do he gives them a garment now i don't know about you in your bible but the garments the holy ghost i don't believe those guys are going to the white throne either no if you got the holy ghost why would you ever go to the white throne now i don't have brother brahm saying that but i can read between the lines i've got 101 quotes where brother graham said if you're in love with him my wife's here i can write a letter and give it to sister june and she'd read it and go okay be like reading the newspaper wouldn't it yeah huh if i gave my love letter that i wrote to my wife to you women you'd go okay but my wife can read between the lines she knows me can i say it different she loves me when you love each other you read between the lines how many of you in a marriage your wife will say something you know really what she's saying i've been around my wife long enough i can tell you exactly if she's mad at me or not here the other day i said are you mad at me no i'm not mad at you finally two hours later i got to admit she was mad at me now you wouldn't know that you say okay she's not mad she said she's not mad i knew better yeah i know her i love her i can read between the lines right aren't you that way so this love letter the bible that we got we read between the lines yeah i want to tell you we do we read look when brother branham said that jesus christ went down to the lower regions kicked the devil in the seat of the pants and took the keys where are you getting that in the bible can you read that in the bible where he kicked me to see the bands took the keys did jesus read between the lines did brother adam read between the lines amen huh then we get mad at preachers and i'm going to tell you this this is what you got to be preachers if you oh you know what you're not saying what's said on tape brother claude because you don't say it exactly like brother branham jesus jesus nicodemus iii he told nicodemus or no i'm sorry i said that the other day at church too saint john 3. i said that in church the other day you tell i'm not god i make mistakes see but saint john 3 quit it st saint john 3 nicodemus jesus told nicodemus you must be born again show me that verbatim quote in the bible he told nicodemus he said nicodemus you're a leader you're a ruler you ought to know these things you ought to have a revelation of what i'm telling you about and this guy comes and said can i crawl back into my mother's womb boy that's a revelation isn't it really not right so i'm going to tell you where jesus said you ought to know it it means it's already wrote in the word right exactly so where did he go you got to go to ezekiel 36 to get this one he said you'll receive a new heart a spirit a new heart there's the new birth why didn't nicodemus because he paraphrased it and they were so stuck on running a pen through a word you had to say verbatim the word that's the problem with some preachers in this message you can't read between the lines you can't paraphrase i tell the church if you read between the lines and you paraphrase and you keep the continuity of the message in the word i'll amen you all the way cause i got the holy ghost and knows if you're saying the truth or not exactly we're like a bunch of programmed monkeys and rats in the message boy i mean come on people get a revelation amen that's right brother madam said if you're not in the quotes if you're not in a message you're not in your bible you'll miss it right this guy ain't going to do all your studying for you ain't going to do all your praying either he's not a pope that's what a pope does he don't want you to read your bible he don't want you to study he'll do all that for you all he wants you to do is a bunch of hail mary's yeah well that goes a long way he's doing it geez but that's the truth come on people you got the holy ghost one of the nine spirits is discernment you know what discernment is you're supposed to be able to judge if it's right or not when a preacher comes up here you're supposed to have enough discernment in your life that you ought to know if he's telling has anybody ever sat there and heard a preacher or something inside he go ding ding ding ding ding am i the only one that's ever experienced that you know what that is discernment god has put alarm in you do you know where that guy ain't preaching you the truth it's the truth we we got the gifts working people are looking for gifts they're here we got discernment we can judge judge yourselves lest you be judged we got wisdom we got understanding what you've been talking about we got a revelation that's faith by the way that's one of the gifts did you know that amen you got the gifts working here but what we want to do is we want to do the lesser gifts speaking in tongues right that's what most people want that look i want the greater gifts that's what honestly that's what i want now i'm not going to do anybody with tongues and stuff like somebody speaking fine but you better do it in order we got quotes on that right that's right okay it's the truth so what i what i what i can do is by the book of redemption i can tie the book of redemption is the opening of the word that's what it is it's the book of redemption being opened to a people and the book of it is the complete full fullness of the word that's given in this hour i don't guess i don't probe anymore like i told him the other day i was preaching this let me you want to hear my song i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know amen don't you don't you know what the book of revelation is don't you know what the mysteries are haven't it been taught here isn't this a preacher that's been preaching you the mysteries the book of redemption the fullness of the word so a preacher and a message i had a preacher i'm oh this makes me sick i could jump out a window i had a preacher come to my church one time we were eating pizza together he said i don't preach the mysteries at my church i like to gagged on the pizza i just stared at him i thought you don't preach the mysteries he's not preaching rapturing faith he's not punching the bishop preaching the book of redemption that allows the people to see their names on the book does everybody got what i'm saying there would you do me a favor brother joseph go to that quote in 63 and question answers on the seals 63. he's awake back here isn't he i know i'm teasing i'm not known for my patience but i'm not going to ask god for it tribulation worketh patience if i pray for patience i always say god i want patience right now because whatever you say it'll be that way so if you ever pray for patience you better be careful okay let's see 3.95 is that the one i wanted uh i don't think that's the one i wanted no that's not the one i want the ones that's questioned answers on the seals well thank you yeah move it up to 8a and brother is it true that every jew born since christ that came in the world to be saved no nothing will be saved only those names who were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world jew or gentile see that's all the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now amen the book he's talking about the book of redemption that's what's unfolding to the people now look and the book is only unfolding now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is exactly what it is the book of redemption is giving you the the the revelation of what the plan of redemption is and you've you can see your name on the book of life if you don't get the plan how are you going to get your name there has anybody ever worked in a project at work do they ever put you on a project that you're not a part of the plan right if you've got jet a and jet b and you're going to assemble jet a they don't give you the directions to plan for jet b right so god has given you the book of redemption which is the plan the mystery of redemption because why your name's on the book of life the la i'm gonna go the book of life you're the one that's gonna receive the fullness of this hour and because you've got the mystery of it that calls your name you know your name's in the book of life look in chapter 5 what was it that john got he says he looked around he said all was lost no one was worthy what did he get a revelation a mystery was revealed to him right and the elder said behold the lamb of god did take away the huh the sin of the word no does that be it but he turned around he seen a lamb the flesh of god that's what he said that god had come from the flesh and died for us he got the mystery of the redemption that's what was open and because that book of redemption was open he could see his name on the book if the mystery is not made known to you you don't the mystery that your name is there's not been revealed to you that's the whole purpose of the book of redemption being revealed in this hour because we're at the end of it and there's a people that needs to get the revelation sure right and we're the people that gets that we got the whole plan or we know the whole plan of redemption does everybody understand the first seal that was the redemptive plan for the ephesus and smyrna age do you agree right we understand how the holy spirit and the antichrist worked in that hour the people that were under the second they got the revelation of what that seal was even even paul said there's ana there's people here there's there's people working in your midst now who's not saying what i said brother bam said in the days of paul they put their finger on said you're not saying what paul said is that what he said you're not saying if an angel right or a preacher him it says him not her that's why we don't believe in preachers by the way he said if they preach any of the gospel and i preach you let them be accursed because paul knew he had the right revelation for that hour and you couldn't add to that revelation you couldn't take away from it and we've had the right revelation given this hour and i can't add to what brother bam said and i can't take away from it if i do then my name's not here folks everybody here this that book of redemption calls my name the mystery of it and it tells me what that my name is right where it's at it's the truth if you ain't lining up with the message it tells you exactly where you're at right come on you know where you're at you know nobody has to tell you where you're at you don't have to tell them where they're at they know where you're at right you know if you got the baptism oligos you got the fullness the person right see we don't have a temporal gift here we got a person in the holy ghost living in us is that right the person's living in you now exactly does everybody the person is the fullness of the word amen it's the fullness the word that's living in you now that's what's going to take you out justification ain't going to get you in the rapture sanctification ain't gonna get you in the rapture but the person the temporal gift of the baptism holy ghost thing will get you in the rapture the person is what's gonna get you in a rapture somebody told me one day i said there's only one going to make it in the rapture they said what are you talking about right there's only eight that got raptured one it's those that are baptized into the body of jesus christ it's the ones that have the person of jesus christ that's the one going in the rapture that's who the rapture is for does everybody understand that but the one that's a rapture for is the ones that the book and i keep saying over and over i want you to catch what i'm saying it's the ones who had to have had the plan of redemption and that book of redemption was sealed with seven seals everybody agree with that seven seals is what it was what it was sealed with okay we know what the first four are through the church ages fifth seal facile jew right ones that were blinded god's gonna give him god's gonna give him a garment if you tell me they're going to the white throne i don't get it something's wrong with my thinking the 144 000 are they gonna go to the white they're gonna be in the millennium right right right aren't they sure they ain't gonna go to the white throne why they're gonna get same baptism oligos you got right they're gonna receive the fullness of the word like you got glory they're gonna get daniel 70 weeks they're going to get the six-fold purpose of daniel's and it's going to open up that they're the ones that are part of it just like the six seals where what six is redemption it's told you that your name's under there that you're a part of that plan come on that's what reveals a name to you the book of redemption amen glory right amen so we understand we understand what sin seal is coming of the lord right is that what brotherhood said the end of all things another thing he said with it don't have a problem with that sixth seal look under the sixth seal the hundred forty four thousand will be redeemed right you agree all right what's going to happen the the the foolish virgins the ones that are justified and you know they're not going to take a rapture the foolish virgins they're virgins but they didn't go all the way they didn't get their lamps full of oil right so they could be in a justified sanctified state and miss the rapture does it mean they're lost no they'll be getting granted eternal life at the white throne because why their name's not taken off the book alive you reject any part of this plan you are right yes sir they only seen it so far you agree brother bam said you reject this message you die and go on to hell exactly amen that's what he said that ain't what i you know that's not me that's him does everybody understand that okay i know it may be a little different or maybe it didn't i'm sure he's preached it before okay amen let's go back to the third i'm gonna go to the third pool a little bit and then i'll finish it what time do i have brother wade 3 30 5 minutes this is this is his standard deal wow but does everybody understand the third pool is the opening of the word right to save time and not have to read and you put it up there put it up where the third pull is three parts in the seventh seal you've got that quote brother joseph i think right third pull the seven seal quote that i gave you where the third pull is three parts he's asleep at the wheel again oh i'm giving him a hard time okay the first i'm gonna go down a little bit first full healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the mysteries revealed everybody understand the book no more there's no more higher order reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be vindicated by the word and remember the third pool was the opening of them seven seals so i can now point the third pool to revelation 10 beyond a shadow without okay that's right to reveal the hidden truth it's been sealed in the word do you see it is that the last one where's it says three yeah here where's the three things where did i miss it now there's three things we're going to say and i don't know if that's what i want either talking about three parts you know that one oh here hold on i got it i kind of gave them to him at the last hour so don't blame him let me read let me just quote it you guys know what you've been taught here sorry internet people what no no that's not the one i want when brother am talks there's three parts one of them happened yesterday yeah everybody know that one what happened yesterday was the sixth seal what was open redemption so what is the third pull it's the book of redemption open and that exactly points to revelation 10 7. does everybody agree with that the second part of the third pull is the coming of the lord the third part is it's unknown right okay this is there's three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today brother man is preaching the seventh seal so the one that unfolded it was the coming of the lord does everybody agree with that or yesterday the other one unfolded so yesterday what happened it was the look he finished the book of redemption does everybody understand that exactly and the only way you're going to see the book of redemption is if you see the redeemer right right come on that that's exactly what happened in chapter five when he seen the lion of the tribe and he said the bloody lamb he quit crying why did he quit crying not just because he's seen the redeemer but he got to see his name on the book so guess what the book of redemption was open to him where it was unsealed brother he could see his name there does everybody understand john's seen the whole plan he's seen it he heard it but he couldn't write it right okay it's the truth this is the third pool one unfolded today or yesterday the one unfold today and there's one thing that i cannot interpret because it's an unknown tongue you know why i can't interpret it it'll happen when it happens you speak the word and i'll perform it right now i want to explain something to you i want to get into the third pool and i'm going to finish it's going to be a little 20 minutes or so i'm going to hurry forgive me hey time should be no more how many believe that okay no more mysteries it's really what it is you get the real so let's talk about the third pool okay where was i at i lost myself when i made that statement unknown language thank you so does everybody understand that brother branham in 1956 when he had the vision the tent vision i've got the notes but brother i got 40 pages now i'm just going to get it out when he seen the vision the last thing the angel lord told him he said it won't be a public show and jesus and brother man said i don't understand why did you know he said that didn't he the angel lord said you remember this scripture in matthew 6 you go into your closet it'll be a secret thing right if you pray in secret i'll reward you openly is that what it says i tell people in our church if you want to know the third pool read matthew the whole chapter of six right did you know that let me show you it says in that chapter ask what you will it'll be given to you did you know that it tells you to go in your prayer closet and pray god will reward you openly it's humility right right the third pull that's still elijah that still small voice that's still there if you look at it's humble this is humble what we got does everybody you're not boastful with it you're not like the guy i told you and i want to go back to that that says i'm going to create me a a number six spicy chicken sandwich that is carnal folks you better you better you better get with a plan on that one you understand i mean people have almost taken the third pool and turned it into a fairy tale we tell our kids well it's the squirrels it's the little fishy but have we added the scripture to it your children's faith's final resting place is in the word you can talk about the squirrels you can talk about little fishy you can talk about sister hattie wright but have you put it back in the word right i know that sounds it sounds weird the way i'm saying it now i'm gonna go read it brother branham said there was five signs that thoroughly vindicated the third pool is that what he said you're amen in it he said it there's five signs so i'm gonna read some quotes and i'm gonna move on the first one was a little fishy does everybody agree with that now if you're here and you've never heard the message of how little say little fishy what's that do for you yeah yeah i'm true right what does that do for you if i say squirrels you'll think we fell off a rock what would you do if you weren't a message somebody said oh yeah brother brandon spoke a little fish he gave him back his life and he did but why can't you put the scripture with that right do you think they're gonna you tell them little fishies and they're gonna call the white wagon for you with a white jacket what we've done in the message we talk about the little fishy we talk about the squirrels we talk about hattie wright we talk about sister meaty we talk about those five signs that we're giving to thoroughly venice but we never put the word with it isn't it right we've been talking about that the last days a lot they'll take the quotes they never put it in the word that's what me and him as a preacher we're obligated to put them quotes and put them back into the word right i pro i told brother uh wade one time it always baffled me where brother brahm said you could have the baptism of the holy ghost on your spirit realm and die and go to hell every day of your life you could have it die and go to hell then brother branham i read a quote one day brother brahm said the children of israel ate manna that fell from heaven every day he said that manna was a type of the baptismal holy ghost and they everyone died you ever thought when you eat you know what eating does it the natural eating does nothing for your soul but you know what it does it helps your flesh it makes your spirit feel better his spirit feeling when you eat them four tacos for lunch tomorrow it'll make you feel so good so those people that ate that men are from heaven they had it all the way to a good feeling but they never went over and possessed the land and they died come on it's the truth people i'm telling you the truth so that's where brother brahm said you can have the baptism every day of your life on the spirit realm and die and go to hell right right you could come in here and hear this message every day of your life and die and go to hell if you don't get it down in that third area where that third pool operates then you can die and go to hell there you better get this thing all the way down to the third round okay let's talk about a little fishy first okay i want to read a quote here brother adam said brother man has talked about all these five signs in my new ministry okay but i told you you see how the third pool connects with the opening of the word right so these little stories that we've heard and we tell them to our kids do you not realize that these five things are the opening of the word to brother branham right so after this rather random down the line and anointed ones that he can say it's the opening of the word brother brandon finally got a revelation of what it was all about i told the church you know jesus he was sitting there and he said don't go to the gentiles go to the lost sheep of the house israel does everybody agree with that now matthew 16 he says go into all the world what change a dispensational change what happened in 1963 a dispensational change i want you guys know it something happened a dispensational change where brother and before they said you won't know it i'll leave take it to my grave then he turns around after 66 it's totally been vindicated we all know what it is now you see what i'm saying you say well brother bram said this over here will never will he'll leave here with it we'll never know what the third pool is how many heard preachers say that message preachers then he turns around after 63 the dispensational change and he says we know what it is it's been thoroughly vindicated there's been fine signs given us to know it right come on is that what he said you that know the message is exactly what he said it's a little fishy brother branham was sitting here waiting to pray for 300 children brother brahma was worried what am i going to do remember i read to you in the redemptive and it's not what you do it's what god's going to do for you quit thinking about you all the time all you got to do is get a revelation get this message packed into the third realm of you that's what you're responsible for god's gonna do the rest okay so brother bran was in the boat holy spirit moved down and said stand up said speak to that little fishy and she'll have its life again he'd been laying there dead for a half an hour right i'm going to go on here and brother man's talking about the little fishy now i want you to hear what he says and that stuck with me hard that i could hardly rest day and night this is 59 he did that spoke to the little fishing 57 that's been two years ago and constantly has haunted at me and i say oh i can't say nothing about it remember the angel lord said don't say nothing about it don't explain this third pool okay so he didn't he didn't he didn't say anything oh i just couldn't say nothing about it for i can't place it in the atonement but listen now brother branham in 59 he's starting to explain it okay look what he says he said i couldn't explain it in atonement now go to your bible saint john 15 7. saint john 15 7. and i'm going to paraphrase what he probably didn't say it exactly verbatim but i want you to see it's in the word so brother i'm saying i couldn't explain it i couldn't put it in the atonement that little fish he's speaking it right but listen to what he says whatsoever you say it shall come to pass you can have what you say and i've stood here at this same pulpit and tried and run on the scripture and refrained from it and go back because i was afraid to use it you know why brother braham didn't use this scripture saint john 15 7 whatsoever you say it shall come to pass it's because he didn't see it in the atonement it wasn't open to him yet the word had not been opened to brother branham on that particular scripture does everybody understand that so until it's opened to him brother branham couldn't talk about it once it was opened to him he could he you know brother he said brother you always try to explain yourself right he said you can't teach pentecostal babies spiritual things right you cannot have faith you cannot have faith unless you know what you are doing brother brahm didn't have a revelation of that scripture he had tiptoed around it wouldn't even hardly mention it in the pulpit right right but when he did a little fishy it says the scripture says ask what you will in my name and i'll be it'll give me given to you brother branham that day stood up sat there and watched that little fishing for 30 minutes dead and he stood up and said little fishy i give your life in the name of jesus christ that scripture had been revealed to him had been opened the third pool is the opening of the word amen does everybody understand it's the opening of the word so the little fishy opened that word is that right brother now the squirrels brother brandon was sitting there and i'm going to read all the quote if you want to go look at him it's my new ministry e33 but brother branham was sitting there and he went squirrel hunting it was so dry when he walked on the leaves the squirrels seen you heard you coming for a mile they were plowing the field next to it so he knew there wouldn't be no squirrel there right so brother branham sat out on a log and he said i've been wondering about a scripture right the scripture was whatsoever you say to this mountain to be moved from here to yonder if you believe it if you have faith in it it'll be moved where you say and only to say that is that if you move it from here cast into the ocean so that scripture gave a very specific location that that mountain was coming from this place to that place brother branham was meditating on that he said i don't understand that scripture it's always befuddled me it's always been a mystery to me well this one the lord said all of a sudden a voice come to him said what are you doing he said well i'm hunting squirrel he said well how many do you want he said three right he said where do you want him everybody get what i'm saying where do you want them i want them in a white poplar tree a red squirrel and a white tree boy that ain't going to happen if you hunt a squirrel that don't happen a red squirrel ain't going to get a white tree i could shoot them and i'm not nearly a good shot like brother branham they don't do it so he actually spoke the word and that squirrel was right where he said it would be and that say unto this mountain to be moved from yonder to there and it'll be moved what was god doing he was opening the word to your prophet he used the little squirrels to do it brother man didn't understand that word what was god doing opening the word to your prophet what is the third pull it's the opening of the word so we take these things we tell oh we talk about the little but we never tell them the scripture that's been opened with it it wasn't just speaking squirrels to be speaking it wasn't a frivolous windy sandwich it's god opening his word to his bride that's what it's the third pull is going to be all about opening the word to you to where ask what you will and it'll be given to you if you ask in the name of jesus christ for your children you can have them to a gentile you speak the word and he'll do it brother beat him in a church age book finally speak the word and i will perform it does anybody see any doubt in that don't look at the circumstances speak the word gentile man glory it doesn't say pray under the mind said speak to the mountain that's the third pull it's the opening of the word we'll ask what you will and i'll give it to you amen amen if you say to this mountain be plucked up and cast in the sea and shall not doubt in your heart this is by the way matthew if you want to write it down 17 20 21 21 and mark 11 23 god was opening those scriptures to your problems amen he didn't understand it right and because his name was here has anybody got what i'm saying god was going to reveal the book to him how many of you people have looked at the scriptures i don't understand it this man preaches a week later right god's obligated to use bride the third pool is now working among you has thoroughly been made manifest the third pull to you is the opening of the word right all you got to do is say god i don't understand what brother samuel said and god's going to get it to you if your bride if your name's on the book he's obligated to you glory he's going to get it to you you know why he's going to do it it's not because i'm just some big shot he knew i would receive it if he gave it to me he knew if god would reveal it he knew i would take the whole thing i began to think of it about what he did with the prophets after i was speaking there for a while inside myself just thinking until i became so conscious of something near until i was talking to someone and something said to me that's any atonement for if a man or woman is so consecrated and surrendered to god you think the third pool's going to work with some of you guys you better get yourself consecrated close to god right because when this third pool brother man said what you've seen in part right it's going to lay dormant for a season but when the pressure comes down you'll see it in its fullness so if you don't get consecrated and close to god now when that third when that pressure comes down you're cooked right that's right you're in the gravy then you're in trouble you better i'm gonna tell you something i told my church now you mind if i tell them word tabernacle or whatever spoken word church you better get close to god where we're at now this thing's fixing to grind down and it's going to come so close if you're not close to him now you're no you're going to miss it right the third pool ain't going to work for you if you're not consecrated and something said to me that's in the atonement for if a man or woman is so consecrating surrender to god that god just moves in and uses their voice huh and isn't the man speaking it's god that's in him speaking i thought that's right right so the whole point brother branham even after god did it the first time remember there's six squirrels brother branham was still had a question in his mind about saying to this mountain right the first time he said okay i want you in this tree i want you that tree i want you in this tree and they were right the next time he did it which was on november the 7th i got the date on it and my new ministry gives the day brother madam said this it got so precise with the scripture saying to this mountain to be moved from here to there he said okay you want three squirrels where are they going to be one will come from the north one will come from this direction want to come did he give the direction precisely with that scripture a location you see right say this mountain will be moved from here to here that's a location brother baby said i want it in the north i want this one in the south i want this one over here right brother brown shot the first two right he then it got was getting so dark brother man couldn't see and he shot another a knot hole on a tree he thought well it was a squirrel remember it went around fell down brother man went to find it he couldn't find it brother battle said well i got to get back two's enough witness where the brahms spoke three right right yeah and not only did he speak three he spoke what direction they'd come from so he goes away brother brown's walking back the squirrel comes from the south he says it brother brown heaved up his gun was going to shoot it he said there's the third one the lord said didn't you say the third one will come from the north yeah he's going to shoot the ones in the south see how precise the scripture is it was going to be just the way brother random said it it was going to be exactly where he said it would be it's going to be god was precisely revealing to him that one scripture that he wondered about right it was the opening of the word everybody get what i'm saying so when we talk about the squirrels people it's the scripture if you say this mountain to be moved here to there but what we do is we say oh yeah the squirrels oh yeah we make it sound like super rangers or my grandsons power heroes and all that but the message we've got to where we don't really tie the word in with it what is your absolute the word if you're going to talk about the squirrels show them the scripture where it's that way that's where your faith rests in the word if you don't you're just making it a fable even though it happens you've got to prove in the word glory that's what we've been talking about right thank you lord so you everybody understand that he told an exact precise well i just was amazed at it i got a bunch of quotes on the squirrels well i went with my church i read every third pool quote and ran it down for them but i had time like you did three destiny i'm not in a hurry are you are you in a hurry no you preach you preach until we get a little rapture right god puts it on your heart i don't get in a hurry sister had he right brother man said the same jehovah joy trying to get his promise over to me and my thickness and dumbness of mine right see god's revealing something to your prophet he could he could speak my need and existed the same as he could speak abraham's needing to exist and that super anointing swept over me tell hattie that she's found grace in the sight of god who would have thought said tell her to ask whatsoever she will then you speak it by this gift into existence whatsoever she asketh exactly speak it into predict into existence see brother bram didn't have time to pray you better get your praying up done now gentiles exactly because when that third when that pressure comes down you're going to be you better be speaking this message right you better be speaking the word and he'll perform it is that what he said amen i looked at cedar city sister hattie the first time it was ever performed on a human being i said sister addy ask what you will god's going to give it to you everybody agree with that seven times he is converted by animal seven is god's completeness here's the first time on a human being a poor little widow woman that could hardly write her name god knows what he's doing he said ask what you will had he said to me brother branham what do you what do you mean of course i'm gonna i'm kind of cut i'm trying to hurry okay and she said brother bill my greatest desire my greatest desire see god will give you the desire of your heart right opening of the words what it always is glory for the salvation of my two boys it wasn't a minute later those two boys were on her knees right crying out to god and brother ham said they were saved and they're coming to church they're filled with the holy ghost amen now you argue where they're at today with him i don't know but i know it happened just like he said it happened okay okay i had some scripture wrote down somewhere for it i was going to read everybody remember the canaanite woman remember that canaanite woman and she came to jesus said i got a sick daughter right you know what she did she spoke the right things the canaanite woman was just exactly like sister hattie wright exactly he she said she said son of david right my child my daughter's sick grievously sick would you heal her he didn't pay attention to it but when she said lord he's lord of all when she spoke the right thing what did sister hattie right do she spoke the right thing exactly she spoke the right thing and when she did she got the desire of her heart when that little canaanite woman spoke the right thing is that right jesus said what do you want or jesus said well no i've come to the lost sheep of the house of israel she said even the dogs get the crumbs she kept saying the right thing is what she did is that right and what did she do she said you know what what do you want my desire my will it says in the scripture which is your desire it's for my daughter to be healed he said go your daughter's healed the canaanite woman what was it it was the opening of that word right there sister hattie wright was no different than that canaanite woman so the third pool is the opening of the word does everybody understand that so when brother braham said that it wasn't just it's that's what it is what is the third going to be pool be for you it's the opening of the word right it's going to be where if the hour that you have a desire or a will and you're so consecrated with god god's going to go to the and it's not you you're just not going to sit there one day and say well i want that it's not going to be haphazard every time the voice spoke to him and said do this tell sister hattie wright what are you hunting for squirrels right what did he say he said stand up speak to the little fishy is everybody he was so consequent the third pool worked in the third round where he said you look what are you doing speak the word does everybody understand it wasn't just some haphazard thing that you do you're not going to get this if god ain't communicating with you now people think oh yeah i'm going to speak of wendy's really you're so consecrated to god you can't come to church half the time like i said you better get consecrated there's a life that comes with this message so you understand sister hattie i'm i'm about done sorry i know who you ain't remember brother branham in the storm he said that was the fourth sign excuse me remember jesus was on the boat that time and it said it the the waves were so bad the storm was so tumultu they're bad i can't say that word with my voice right now that the boat was full of water i told the people at church i said not only did jesus walk on water he slept on it it said the boat was full of water he says he was in the back of boat asleep so he must have been sleeping on the water too because it didn't wake him one bit and one of the disciples run said don't you care that we perish don't you care and jesus wasn't worried one bit he goes what's wrong with you man so jesus went up there brother baby said he put his foot on the bow of the boat and he spoke to the storm now look it was during a pressure time that he did that does everybody see the picture the boat was full of water it did not look good right it the boat was full of water things were not going well at that point right right so jesus went up there and he spoke to the storm and it stopped does everybody agree with that it's like i told the church no wonder the third pool when the pressure comes your boat may be full of water right just speak the word is that right that's why he wasn't excited he said why don't you speak the word what he could have said right just speak the word that's what the third pull is all is in the fullness it's going to operate when the pressure comes down i'm going to tell you there's three quotes about pressure you better get ready for the pressure people you think this thing's going to be just a you better get ready i've been studying some things about the natural jew brother baby said that's true pre-tribulation does everybody understand that right there are some things that's already happening and i i don't think we see that i'll let you read part of it today i might mention that so you understand speak into the storm brother branham was told those hunters if you don't get off that field in 10 or 20 minutes you're going to die it's going to rain it's going to snow it's going to drop 20 foot and you'll be dead in 30 minutes well brother branham told him that he had to believe what he said he's going down the mountain the lord said go back up where you come from he said well i'll perish it verbatim what it says in that scripture right it looked bad you talk about some pressure he said go back up there he went back up there and he said speak to the storm it'll be exactly like you say it was it right same thing that it was with jesus right what is it the third pull was to for brother brandon when we get to see it was the opening of the word that's what it's for you it's going to be these little scriptures that you've got that you've had in your heart that you may say i don't understand it's going to he said in the day you're taken before the council don't even give it any thought i'll speak for you exactly amen right when i chapter 4 remember i told you in exodus it told moses i'll speak for you the third poll is i'll speak for you it's not you speaking it's him speaking through you that's what the third pull is not this premeditated stuff these people think boy life's going to be peachy keen no he'll speak it through you when you need it it'll be there now can i explain that part of it the third part that's unknown tongue that i can't explain i can't explain i don't know what'll exactly happen but i do know when a pressure comes down whatever i have need of in that hour he'll be given unto me i'm going to make a rapture they ain't going to kill me there ain't nothing they can do to keep me out of the rap out of the body change i'm going to be changed amen so i'm not worried about this oh hide you're looking up here i quit worrying about it all i'm worried about is getting all the word in me i can i want the third pull manifest in me okay the last one was sister meaty right remember brother madam said he said whatever you say brother man was praying right and he said boy you know brother brandon said boy i lost one wife i don't want to lose another and the lord come to him and said you know what speak it it'll be the way you say it is that what he said he said before the scalpel touches her that growth will disappear is that right did it happen that's exactly like the roman centurion he come to jesus he said well you don't have to go to my house just speak the word is that what brother branham did he spoke the word he wasn't even present when it happened does everybody understand and the roman centurion you know he told him he said you don't have to go and so jesus said be it according to your word be it so so coming back at the end it says remember this brother said it don't say in the scripture but it does say it if you read between the lines but he says in the same hour that jesus said he was well when his century was going back to a sick servant he met somebody a long way and said don't worry about jesus coming he's well brother man said he asked what hour it was the same hour that it was exactly like he spoken god was revealing to him that word there's certain things that brother man might have preached for 30 years but he didn't have the fullness of it yet and god was opening the word to him okay now remember the third pull which is the opening of the word the fullest that will work when the pressure comes down amen i was reading the brother rather uh wait i was looking something up i like to read about i'm a history buff i guess you called me but israel israel in the second world war i've got clippings do you know israel declared war on germany before germany declared war on judea you've seen it didn't you so say it i've got it i can show it to you my notes in 1933 the jews worldwide put a boycott on germany the reason they put a boycott on it some of them read his book his book pretty well told what he was going to do to the jews right now we got a book that pretty well tells us what's going down don't we this has been revealed to me and brother branham turn around preach why i'm against denominationalism why do you think that they're going to come down on us because we've already boycotted them right our boycott comes long before theirs comes brother branham constantly when he talks about the pressure he talks about a boycott does everybody know that how many here have boycotted denominationalism right amen i have brother bram said why i'm against it he says in 1804 come out of her my people see the jews that are they knew what hitler was up to they boycotted him a lot of you don't realize that i can show it to you or they absolutely showed judea declares war on germany and the pressure that come back on the jews was or on the jews because they already started a boycott against them what do you think the reason the pressure is going to come on you because you've already boycotted them it's pre-tribulation it's showing you the same thing how much of that pressure let me show you something the jews there were jews that stayed in europe and and most of them died did you know that some of them escaped to france some of them escaped to belgium they didn't go far enough you know brother and there's a quote where he talks about europe how he jumped across the pond to wesley did it's a type justification sanctification went over to america which is a type of the baptismal doctor quote there's a quote for that you know the jews that stayed in europe under justification died if you can fall off at jessica you're in trouble if you stay there people if you're on that part you're going to bust tribulations they're going to come after you sanctification if you went to england they can still drop bombs on you there's a lot of jews died in london that got bombs dropped on them so you still fall off there but the ones who went to america when one bomb wasn't one jew killed a type of the baptism holy ghost amen right that's what you have to do that was a natural type showing you that it ain't good enough justification in this hour it's not exactly right sanctification is not good enough in this hour the devil can still drop stuff on you there right but you got the baptism the holy ghost the devil sealed out and god sealed in the devil cannot handle you then there ain't one thing can harm you when you got that right and that's what we got to come to we got to come the fullest the word the baptism holy ghost we got to understand what these things we got to have faith what they had in the first exit you're going to know it you need to thank god for a preacher that's preaching the mysteries this preacher here preaches the book of redemption and that book of redemption is what's going to call your name the mysteries is what's going to call your name and you're going to see right where you're at that's what does it does everybody understand that so that's what the book of redemption is it's just the plan of redemption the mysteries of it honestly guys why are you worried why are you fearing are you a gentile like the canaanite woman like the centurion why don't you just speak the word and let god perform it amen why don't you just believe what god gave you in this third pool the opening of the word like i said this morning i thought it was funny that i'm preaching this if this is the 50th year that i think it's odd that i'd be preaching on the third pool i think god's trying to get to us now it's time that we start speaking it it's time that we understand what the third pool is and the third pool starts working in the car and it is by the opening of the word okay so i hope i didn't lose anybody i'm sorry to keep you so long it took me seven services back home to just preach the third pool and i preached in two 20 parts but it's easy to preach here because you he's taught you the mysteries so we've been just kind of reminiscing over them today is what we've been doing that's why i told you i just don't think we're getting what god's done for us you know brother samuel me and you he put us down here to minister at the best time on the face of the earth amen and i just i i we don't do god of service right we this is no wonder john was worshiping and thanking god and falling down on his knees that's what we ought to do that same book of redemption has been open to us we get to see our name and you know what people we need to be a happy people amen it's like i've told you here if you don't have joy now the anointing in the millennium's joy what makes you think you're going to be in the millennium if you don't have it here brother said what you are here is what you are there god's good to us don't you thank him for this i can't explain it there's an unknown part i can't explain right the third pull is just going to happen for us when that pressure comes down because you're going to be so one with the word and he's going to say brother samuel what do you want right and you're going to say it's going to be there yeah exactly it's just going to be there how do you explain that how are you going to explain to him what's going to happen four or ten exactly that's the part i can't explain when i know the day that i need it it'll be there amen amen and he's gonna take care of me i thank god he's taking care of me because i ain't gonna done a good job of taking care of me but he's taking care of me in this journey it's a wonderful time god bless your brother saying the lord amen time's up lord bless you sorry thank you sorry i took so long i apologize to you okay don't worry about the word the word no we got all night you enjoy the message what is the the third pool the opening of the word but what is the first pull we say well the first pull is taken by the hand you know divine healing and we say second pull was discernment something but what did the prophet say was it's the opening of the word first pool was opening of the word the second pool was opening of the entire bible sure because that's prophecy prophecy is a setting in order of scripture all right then the third poem is revealing that that's spoken yeah but i mean i've read that scripture everybody but you know if if you say yeah brother branham had two yeah but it didn't come to pass until god come down and quicken that scripture to it then it came to pass right what we got go ahead anybody have a need just remember it's the opening of the word lord you are more the three most valuable things in the world gold silver diamonds and it doesn't even compare to god whatsoever does it anybody have a need heard a great message is coming let's see let's read the benefits of it and nothing god but i love this one anybody else would like to go anybody else oh sing it unto him and think about it know where you are anybody else more precious than silver more colorful is you mean you you would think that i love somebody but i don't want to know what to look like i i don't want to know them i just love them no no no just think about it he is trying his best to get his word to you and i we can read about him running and you don't want to know about him brother said you ever get a touch of god he said you're never satisfied no more just a touch brother joe has something he wants to say to the church i'm sorry if i offended anybody by saying that uh that how much are we gonna get paid for going nursing home uh i have a burden for them people so my mission is to not to think of myself just to think of them actually when i called he said how much do you guys charge and say we have never charged a penny so i'm sorry if i said something wrong offended anybody all right no problem no problem whatsoever the right for one to want your heart to be right amen you enjoy the message enjoy the messages today let's give our brother i like his way of doing put it in the word i mean you can give me the quotes for something but put it in the word let me read it in the scriptures that's right because that quote has got to find you it's got to be if it's right and we believe it to be right then it's got to be in the word because he was a word prophet it doesn't say the quotes come to the prophet he said the word come to the prophet right and all brother was trying to do was just bring that word down to you and i that we could see the god that he saw that's all any minister is doing trying to get you to see the word that has come forth but see we always want to come up with something though because there's the devil as quick as you do the devil will desire to pound yeah but if if we had the word we'd have signs and wonders i believe we are i believe we are having signs right man told me one time he's talking about it he said something about not stealing him i was healed and he said i said well just remember one thing i ain't dead yet you know i was standing there talking to him you know when i was telling him i was healed because that's the way it is but we want we want our way is that what we've been talking about cain cain wanted his way of doing it if god come cain's way cain was happy right but yet because god didn't come that way what about a man it took all of those years to bring him to a place and i'm talking about brother branham and his ministry to where he would finally come to speak in the word yep exactly now don't you think that he wanted to speak that word about his wife don't you think that he prayed for her constantly and wondered and was burdened to why that wouldn't go away but what was the difference from the next day or nothing it was just something that god came on the scene and said you say it and that's the way it'll be it's not that always through this bible we want it being you and i when we have a need god will be there you can't question that when when you see what it is and it's not you it's him speaking through you what an opportunity but brother i always thought the third pool was when i would say it ah ah yeah right you done got in the way no it's when he comes down through you and speaks it but that's not adoption adoption's been telling me i can run the show i thought we believed adoption was the indwelling of the nature of the father into the son i thought that's what we believe so if that's true then it's his nature speaking back out of you and i right we do have something to do with the speaking of the word he left it in our hands you still our brother how much we appreciate it we enjoyed the weekend glad they came out to be with us and praise the lord to be with them traveling back home tomorrow and pray that the lord will bless them and take care of them and give them happiness and joy in the lord amen remember the service is wednesday pray one for another and just remember all the announcements that we've made i remember brother forney will be with us on the 24th uh remember brother uh timothy burdette will be here with us on the watch not service so pray that the lord would bless each one of them this saturday is the fellowship meeting down at brother tony's in atlanta there are six flags if you want to go now let us know don't wait till you know the last minute and show up you know let us know and we'll be glad to try to make a way for you to go there i do not know who's going to speak i never questioned them about that because i go thinking i'm going to hear amen and no matter who it is i will we will have to be leaving at what um well it's two we get there by two we need to
