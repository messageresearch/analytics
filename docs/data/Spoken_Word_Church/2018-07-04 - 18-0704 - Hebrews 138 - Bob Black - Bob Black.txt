========================================

please I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you yes I want to see you to see you I'll shine in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy hi [Music] shining in the Olie Olie holy holy holy holy holy only I want to see you amen it's good to see believers praising the Lord and rejoicing we should have something to worship God about and be happy about I'm just good to be in the house of the Lord in it good to see everybody you got the kind of a good crowd here without he wouldn't with all the ones traveling and everything it's good to have somebody to preach to you know brother Dale was talking about July 4th 1971 oh that was a long time ago that was I was born in 1975 so that you know brother Dale has been pastoring longer and I've even been living and I tell you what it's good - it's good to come to church where the ministries been around a little bit and knows what's going on a little bit so we appreciate brother Dale so much and and brother Wade also even though he's not here everything [Applause] so let's let's go ahead and turn to Hebrews 13:8 I just really just a couple verses to read and I think we've all we were all familiar with Hebrews 13:8 that's the brother you know brother Graham said this is kind of like the hinge of the whole Bible everything just kind of hinges on this on this verse if you if we didn't have this verse then you can be Besant missing a lot you know with this verse we can be confident that the way that you approached him in the Old Testament the same way you approached him in the New Testament that he's unchangeable immutable as Paul said immutable means that there's no way to to change an add anything to it he's a constant and never never never changing so I want to take for a topic today that just just a little statement he is still the same today let's go the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we're so grateful to be able to come together Lord Jesus and fellowship around your word and Lord God I believe Lord tonight and we'd come together with a purpose Lord that everyone this standing here ready to be seated or that you saw us all here gathered together before the foundation of the world and there's a purpose for us being together tonight Lord and I pray God that Lord that you'll come on the scene that that nothing will hinder our the purpose of this gathering Lord Jesus Lord I believe Lord that we all when we gather together we're we're come expecting we come desiring something from you Lord and my desire Lord is to be changed to not leave this place the same way that I came in and Lord I know that that's all of our desire Lord tonight and Lord Jesus I may be something that I can even be said that that'll help me even as I speak Lord and I pray Lord God we just open the doors of our heart as we've opened the door of this church Lord God to welcome one another and we welcome you Lord Jesus because Lord what kind of a service would it be if you weren't welcomed like like when Solomon dedicated the temple what kind of a temple would it have been if you hadn't to come and and took your abode in it Lord Jesus Lord as we come and brought brought all of our little licks of fire together Lord Jesus we know that you're here and I'm we know that you're a prison help in time of trouble and time of need we know Lord that you promised you never leave us or forsake us and so we have confidence Lord and Lord are you being the same yesterday today and forever that you're here with us now Lord God because you promised you would be Lord Jesus as we look into your word Lord of God I pray that you'll make it leap from the pages Lord Jesus into our heart into a new living reality Lord we pray we ask these things in trusting Lord Jesus that you'll bring it to pass and make this service profitable we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let me shed my burden Hebrews 13:8 say is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and then we'll go to Genesis 18 1 and it says and this is talking about Abraham when when God appeared to him there and it says and the Lord appeared unto him and the plains of Mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading other world Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he never changes any others there's really there's really three parts to that verse that I want to bring out tonight like I said it's a verse that we're all familiar and well-acquainted with and you know it signifies it that we should have confidence in God we should believe that he's the same that never-changing well there's there's three really three parts to that verse there's the yesterday and then today and forever and so I've situated this this next scripture that we're going to reads Genesis 81 where or Abraham is sitting there in the heat of the day and it's in front of his tent and it may be will situate him in the middle of that scripture and look at maybe it maybe if it was going to dramatize the scripture a little bit imagine just if you will imagine Abraham sitting there and the heat of the day outside of this tent and it looks like that nothing really is going on it is hot and maybe the dust of the camels all coming up and getting in his face and and his wife is inside getting getting the meal ready and everything getting going about her business and there's just Abraham sitting out in the heat of the day in front of the tent looks like nothing's going on and you know you could maybe look look at your own life look at the things that are happening around you it looks like it might look like to the observer that nothing is going on that nothing's you know that's how God does many times that he'll he'll wait he'll he'll let you that's why I believe we need patience right here is because sometimes it looks like nothing's going on but just hang around a little bit it looks like to everybody that that it's just a bunch of believers gathering together it's just some some man up behind the pulpit telling everybody how they should live or whatever and it looks like nothing nothing really is going on when there's a process taking place there's something going on and so I really want to just think this maybe is a little message of encouragement to you tonight to that that God is still the same yesterday today and forever and if he did something if he did something in the Old Testament you could look back to yesterday and trust that he's he's going to bring to pass his word if you if you go back into the Old Testament and see how God brought his words the ones that live back then and how they waited patiently and how they suffered with long suffering through all the things that they endured and how they they waited for God to bring his word to pass it and look today and see what God is doing because you know as he said they're in the heat of the day it looked like nothing was taking place but then all of a sudden all of a sudden something happened and you know if you read that story it wasn't like Abraham just looked up and he saw way off in the distance three men walking but it says he he looked up and they were right there beside him all of a sudden they were right there all of a sudden the son of man was right there on the scene and he can catch people unawares if they're not if they're not prepared if they're not keeping up with what God is doing if they're not in sync with their beat of this gospel drum so he said and he said in that he said in the tent door in the heat of the day watching for the coming of the Son of Man watching for something to transpire and he was about a hundred years old when this took place you know a lot of times usually we we kind of kind of put a lot of attention toward the young people and everything but maybe this this sermon will be towards a lot of the I'm not gonna say old but the mature ones in the gospel the mature ones in the gospel that have been around a while like yeah I don't think anybody here is reached Abraham's Asian four hundred years old but Abraham had gone through some things he had seen some things and he was he had gone through this process that we're going to talk about the devil a lot of times will try to tell you you'll say nothing's going on nothing's going on in your life and nothing's going on in your church God never did nothing for you a transformation taking place nothing's going on with the bride nothing's going on with there's no difference all these kind of things he'll tell you all these all these lies but you know you can our good response for the devil is remember a good response for yourself is remember remember where you came from remember where God has brought the bridegroom and a lot of times is so easy for us to forget it's so easy for us to forget what God I remember when I was growing up my my dad kept it a little notebook that he'd just over the years he just filled up and he kept writing in it God would do one thing God would do another thing like when my brother went in the hospital for a long time because the doctors couldn't tell what was wrong they and he was in the hospital get wasting away wasting away and he went before God and prayer and and began seeking God the doctors couldn't do anything all they could say was if something's wrong but I don't know what it is and and so he wrote this down in his book is it a little book of remembrance that when God came on the scene and delivered him and and and healed him brought forth the great deliverance he wrote it down it God God did it on such and such a day and he wrote he wrote it down so you can go back and look at that when we were in the car one day and we were around I had something on my face and and he began to pray in it the thing just fell off and you write it down in your little book and these are just things growing up but that we're remembering you and so you look back you can look back in your little book of if you wrote it down but you know think of it we all have things that we could remember of what God has done for you and you know the danger is that you almost you can forget so easily what God had done for you remember that if my wife or I look at her and say remember the time that when we first moved to Atlanta and we've got an apartment and then we bought a house and it looked like we were not going to be able to get out of that apartment because they had a they wouldn't let you out within the time period we had only been there a few months and it was time to move into the house and we just went to the lord god help us that everything will be smooth out we would be able to get out of the apartment and and lo and behold everything just smoothed out problems with the twins when Monica was pregnant just go to the Lord all the amniotic fluids bury them fairly they're just so many things that we could testify of that you forget so easily of what God has done for you and you you get into a state where you start your going along through the heat of the day and you begin to the devil can prey upon your mind and you start thinking well nothing's taking place but it's because you've forgotten the second Peter 3:1 he said this second epistle beloved I now write unto you and both which I stir up your minds by way of remembrance sometimes you need somebody to kind of stir up your mind a little bit and remember what God has done remember what was written in the Bible remember the promises that were written for you that you can lay ahold to I believe that's what the ministry is for that sometimes you know the ministry can almost almost put complexes on people but I I'm here tonight to take complexes off I'm here to I'm here to bring remembrance so that you realize what God is doing for you maybe take the veil off of your eyes and expose what what that God has been doing for you all down through your life and he said that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets another of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior think about that that to stir up your minds to remembrance that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior why why remember only these things because the things that were written the things that God spoke and the Old Testament and the new all through the Bible were meant to be profitable for you that were meant to loose you from your bondage we're meant to help you and it's good to be reminded of all the benefits that go along with being a Christian but you know there's benefits to being a Christian there's things that come along with that's what Psalm 103 said bless the Lord O my soul and forget forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases and it goes along and lists all these things because you know when you get a job or whatever you're interested in what the 401k plan looks like or what the benefit package looks like or what all of the things that go along with that are and sometimes we forget of the benefits that come along with being a Christian and one of the benefits says that he heals all your diseases you know when you go to the doctor and he tells you that there's no product like if they told my brother when he was when he was just a young fella there's nothing we can do there's nothing with there's no hope for you there's there's nothing at all that we can do don't forget that one of the benefits of being a Christian is that he heals all your diseases when they came to Jesus as he walked on the shores of Galilee as it was recorded in the New Testament when somebody would come to him by faith believing it's not recorded anywhere that he turned them away if you can come to God with that pure unadulterated face that impure that pure faith to just take him at his word he's honorbound it's it's got to happen but yet sometimes we forget sometimes we we kind of stumble it things like that who forgiveth all thine iniquities who forgiveth all the iniquities that's another benefit of being a Christian a benefit of being a Christian is that he for you can come to the Lord when when you've youyou think about what the definition of iniquity is that hits all of us because iniquity is when you know to do something but you don't do it or you don't you both ways you don't do it or you do do it if you if you don't do something that you should or you should do something that you don't and that hits all of us iniquity when you when you're not doing when you're not behaving the way that you should be an iniquity comes because you're not believing right and when you don't believe right because of unbelief then you have a way you have a benefit to come to God and ask for forgiveness God forgive me of this iniquity that's in me forgive me you think about what a great benefit that is think about what a great benefit that is when you're coming to God and you know there's something wrong in your life that you can just come to him and just ask him believing ask him with faith and he'll wipe the slate clean wipe it clean well yeah we forget about those kind of things and scripturally it seems like like a lot of times God is silent for a long while for a long time before anything happens before he begins to move you look at you look at all the ones in the Old Testament let me just run through a few stories and now now the first story is something where where God was kind of taking his time and looked like and that story of Adam and Eve but he's gonna bring forth he was gonna bring forth a child if they would have just held on and waited a little bit then he would have showed them the right way to bring forth children to multiply and replenish the earth but yet Eve even couldn't wait around patience she couldn't hang on for the right revelation and so even though it looked like God was taking a while if she would have just waited and everything would be all right what about Enoch that for three hundred and sixty-five years he walked with God three hundred and sixty-five years that's a long time longer than an Abraham a hundred years three hundred and sixty-five years and then all of a sudden he just stepped right off the earth all of a sudden he walked with God and was not found and no a hundred years and he worked on that Ark over a hundred years laboring on that art while everybody made fun of him and it looked like that was not even any rain up in the sky but then all of a sudden it began to rain all of a sudden the rain began to fall Moses for hundred years they the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and then after Moses was born it was 40 years before God was able to get kind of get him in a way that he could he could even do anything for the Lord because he was running around trying to do it he wasn't equipped for the task he he tried to do things his own way and so they waited 400 years now going down in Egypt and in bondage and and what about Daniel after what it was a 68 years or so he began to look back into the scripture to see whether it was time for them to come out of bondage whether it was time to come out from Babylon after seven years he remembered that story - all of a sudden all of a sudden that one night the the men the armies of I forget who it was came in just after the handwriting on the wall and they took over they took over the land and immediately deliver us all of a sudden and then Jesus after 400 years of no prophets and nothing on the scene and then all of a sudden here comes John the Baptist a man that that nobody had even was probably even aware that he was in the wilderness eating locusts and wild honey after his parents had died and he was he ran off into the wilderness trying to do fend for himself and God began to speak to him and all of a sudden out of the wilderness he came and began to preach about things and make their way to the Lord straight and and then here comes Jesus on the scene though just the son of them the Son of Man on the scene all of a sudden all of a sudden you could by preach a sermon on that all of a sudden all of a sudden something happens and so many other stories of the of things that happen in the Old Testament were these these men went through trials and tribulations were delivered by the hand of God like Daniel and David the Bible says that he is still the same you know another story is that when they after the children of Israel after Moses delivered them over and the the Red Sea and they journeyed through the wilderness then Joshua took them over after they after they had come over the Jordan River then they build up twelve stones they made a little pyre of the twelve stones as a memorial to help them that came after that to remember that God had delivered some already and that God is able to deliver you that's what it really signifies and so when you look out of the lives and Christians fellow Christians and believers and look out of that how that God has delivered one another your life is a testimony that God is able to deliver you that he's able to deliver others as well and all these people that their stories became the Bible their stories they as they live their lives they their stories were written down so that you could look back and remember if God is able to deliver them he's able to deliver me also that's what John 14:26 says that the Holy Ghost would do is it's bringing things back to your remembrance just like Jesus on the day of Annie was walking down that met the ones walking on the on the road to Emmaus he he began to bring things back to their remembrance of what the Old Testament was testifying about the laws and the prophets and all these things they began to testify them and and bring things to their remembrance my like i-44 says remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto Him in Horeb for all Israel with the statues remember ye the law of Moses all these Redemption stories of the lost being found in the Bible to remember and you know one of the things that we often forget is all the things that were even done down through the seven church ages the stories that were told of of Martin with his great faith and and how he had you know you stood there and that they tied into that to that tree and began to hew on the tree and it fell over one way and it started to fall one way but then just God came on the scene and caused it to fall the other way and all these things that we know of the life of brother Branham the pillar of fire appearing and all these all these different things in Malachi 3:16 says then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord and that thought upon his name a book of remembers that God even like I was telling before about how that my dad he should write down in his little book the things that that God had done for him and here's God riding down on a book of remembers before him that of them that fear the Lord and that thought upon his name riding down so that he would remember and I believe we could look into that book of remembrance and and and get encouragement as we study the word we can see the read about the names of the ones that live before us and it and it helps build our faith one of the things that that God did for us to help build our faith is we in Isaiah I'm sorry Jeremiah 16:16 he says he sent he says behold I was sin for many fishers saith the Lord and they shall fish them he's talking about Israel how the Israel had been scattered and and in Jeremiah says that he was sin for many fishers saith the Lord and they shall fish them and after will I sin for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every land out of the holes of the rocks and I believe that these fissures that God's sending out our fishermen to fish you out from all the holes in the rocks the ones that are scattered hither and yon to bring them back into the boat of God's Word to bring them back to catch them with the word of God and bring them back and so that's what God says the fivefold ministry to encourage and to bring into our remembrance what God has already said you know youyou read all of these stories and things about what happened to brother bran what happened to our Aeneas and what happened to Martin and what happened to David and dang it'll all these ones and those are all good but what about your own story because every one of us has to have our own testimony of what God has done so that we could remember and look back what God has done for us and I believe what these three fish these fishermen are taking us pull through is they they cast that that hook out they cast that lure out and when you bite it then God begins to pull you back pull you back to his word that's what brother Branham did he cast that that gospel that that hook out there you know when you when you when you took a bite of that hook being that rainbow trout that he talked about it probably didn't even really understand what you were biting it seemed like I know I didn't seem like it's kind of almost a new thing strange thing and you take a bite out of that and you know cuz he bit he baited the hook with it with signs and wonders and discernment and all those things and he didn't quite understand what what it was about but yet nevertheless you were hooked and he begins pulling you through through one two three pulling you through a three pool journey of your own transformative experience and I believe that's the experience that every believer goes through that's that every believer goes through an experience you know pray for Mack never was gonna attack my throat all of a sudden don't don't be doing that I believe that every born-again believer gets an experience that God takes them through so and that's the experience that brother Brown talked about that every believer has have an experience you know sometimes we look at an experience as a little sensation or a little emotion or whatever jumping around and all those kind of things with experience I'm talking about tonight is experience where you can look back and see where you once were and then look and look and see where you are now and then look ahead and see where you're going because in the end the book of John it says that he'll bring things do you remember it and it'll show you things to come he'll show you your current condition he can show you where you are and the statue of a perfect man he could show you where you are positionally in Christ and I believe that's what the gospel is doing today by those by the by the preaching of the word by the preaching of those those fishermen underneath that the great fisherman of the age who who cast the gospel net and then the fishermen under him began to catch though the word the message that's been preached and and toss out the hooks to catch the believers so let's look I want to kind of take take you through Abraham's journey as he went through really all these three pulls and and so you start off his journey and journey in Genesis chapter 12 where it says that now the Lord had said unto Abram and get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed youyou think about you think about what Abraham his first pool would be when he down there or up there rather if you look at the map up there and the Fertile Crescent after after go back even a little bit further than that after Noah came off the ark all the people gathered around that same area and they begin to one thing led to another and began to put up the Tower of Babel and all those different things and then God confounded their speech and and then so Abraham was the ones that had lived his grandfather and maybe his father also they were all out of worshippers so for Abraham to leave aside all those idols and things and and change his direction and go after God it would take a kind of you know you know he would have had to - bit the hook bit that gospel hook so to speak you know brother Brown tells us tells a little story in in the faith is our victory said Abraham I think this is this should be number three but I left off the number three so it's numbered wrong brothers but it's the third one the third quote he said Abraham just a man with no certain purpose in life just with his father and his friends coming down from Babylon they settled in Shinar and there they had the tower built and so forth and one day while Abraham was praying no doubt he prayed through till he struck the hand of God but how did he do it by faith how did he do it he he just believed God and he said perhaps he thought like this if there is a God who made the Ark and letting know if look through he still lives today that's really what I'm preaching tonight is look look what I how I came he looked at the lives of these that had gone on before he remembered about Noah and he remembered all the ones that about how Noah had been made the ark and how he had delivered him and he said he's got to still be Hebrews 13:8 he's got to be he's got to still live today of course you know Hebrews 13:8 wasn't written yet but it's still applied because he's Hebrews 13:8 somewhere in the land of heathens where he was a sojourner he touched the hand of God and in there God gave him a revelation that there was a city whose builder and maker was God so there I just want to pause for a second and give you a little illustration and what the real evidence of the new birth is because right there something struck him that he saw a part of God he saw who-who God what there's got to be God and there's got to be a city you think about what a great revelation that would be framing him down in a land of idols and and even he began to walk after that city he began to date one foot after the other one step and you know if you look on a map it is hundreds of miles from where he started his journey in the earth County all the way down to Israel all the way down to the Palestinian area that the land the promised land and so he had to walk a long way and it was a long journey before all of a sudden Genesis 18 one was fulfilled he had to be a really patient but you know you think about what is the evidence of the new birth was there it was there any sensation was there any emotion I'm sure there was a lot motions and things you know one thing when you get the new Bertha it will cause a stimulation and I believe the stimulation that was causing Abraham his life was he put his foot out and he began to walk that's what the stimulation in your life is that you begin to walk the gospel walk it might not be apparent on the outside so much so sometimes it might be but it'll start causing you that virtue will start causing you to have knowledge because that'll stimulate your lot your life to produce the fruits and the gospel because God is working in you and so the what is the evidence of the new birth brother Branham explained that or you know many different ways that what the evidence is but one of the primary evidences is that you will hear the word because in John 5:24 says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from death in the life and you know the brother Branham explained that he that believeth believe it is to understand and I think that's one of the biggest confusions and the message today that is you can just come to church and sit there on a pew and warm it warm that pew up and not understand a thing that's going on I have any kind of idea what's going on but when you get the new birth the word will begin to open up to you you know you think about how much the world opened up to Abraham right there when he to realize that God a new City was coming down the gada that this is not my home this is not my home it's it's my earth all right it's my earth but this is not my home but God is gonna clean it up he's gonna cleanse this place with fire and he's gonna he's gonna cleanse it off with water like he did in the day of Noah he's cleaned it off with the blood of Christ when he died on the cross and nany now he's gonna burn it off and bring down a new city so that we can live you talk about a revelation that's a revelation of who Jesus Christ is so if you're sitting in church and/or everything's confusing everybody just keep eating the word because what else can you do right I'm John 443 says why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word why you understand me because you don't have hearing hearing comes by the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the baptism in the Holy Ghost is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it is the revelation after you have after the way has been cleared by being justified after all of your sin has been forgiven I've chopped off after the hall that little old life has been cleared out so that God has a way to step in and you know that's what's different between be before you're born again and after before you're born again God's trying to wait find a way to get in and after your morning and he's trying to find a way to get out and that's where the greatest battle ever fought is it's right there in that spirit room before you're born again he's trying to get through through all that all that clogged up flus of memories and consciousness affection what do you think we'll look at this one over here they they got it this way maybe I got to come exactly that way and you got to get through all of that and he and the way he blasts those flus openings by the word by the revealing of the word and finally he gets in there and that baby's born and he begins to live in you and be consumed come out through the statute of a perfect man through the opening of the word John 14:26 says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things work to your remembrance so you remember what he says so you remember what the prophets said so you remember and encouraged by the scriptures so you remember what your benefits are so you remember what kind of person you are what kind of person he is and you know your day in the hour you recognize your day and its message whatsoever I have said unto you he said he'll teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance now if he's the teacher then you and you're a good pupil you're a good student then the world will be opening up to you little by little it'll be opening up to you he said behold I stand at the door and knock in revelation 3:20 If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me and sup sup is eaten one with another think about that he's eating he's willing to come in the door of your heart and eat with you and while you're eating any anybody knows when you go eat with somebody when you eat with your friend you begin to tell them about things tell them about your life tell them about what's going on what your family's doing and that's the same thing that God does when he comes and subs with you and as communion with you one-to-one he tells you about himself and he begins to commune with you and open up the word to you and so that's exactly what happened to Abraham when he was when he was going through a type of justification and I'm not speaking really a baby form justification but I'm talking about the justification of the soul whether it's who can hold anything to the charge of God's elect who can hold it went up into a born-again believer who can come up against the born-again believer and say in your soul there's something wrong there's something amiss because you've been redeemed and by the opening of the word by the revelation that God has given you his purged you and brought his self to life inside of you put his own life in you Ephesians 378 says that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted rooted and grounded in love that he may dwell in your hearts by faith Romans 5:12 says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God how it was justified by faith by believing on him how are we how do we have access to him by faith by just believing on here in him and taking him at his word and that's something you could you can barely even talk about unless you've experienced it but when you've experienced God it's almost like a Tetris game if you've ever played Tetris see when you're trying to get the little blocks to line up to line up in the right way and when you believe God and say I once was wrong but now I believe this has got to be it and it's true that Tetris block the other word will blood drop right down into your heart and it will change you it would change your being make you a new creature in Christ Jesus that's why that statue of a perfect man brother Brent talked about how that those blocks you couldn't even fit a razor edge between them they all fit together so perfectly to the there's nothing between everything and how do those blocks get that way they got that away by faith by you believing you believe the Word of God and they just dropped down into it permanently slot dropped right in exactly the way it should be and that's how the Christian journey is you just believe God and keep walking how can how can you walk without a revelation how could Abraham walk toward that city whose builder and maker is God if he didn't have a revelation and there was such a thing how do you even know how to walk how do you know how to be a Christian how do you know what the message is about without a revelation that's what we should be seeking for and I want to stress this not who felt he met Abraham could fail all kind of things but they're in the end Genesis chapter 18 he was sitting there in the heat of the day and I bet he felt tired I felt worn out he'd been a lot walking a long time he was a hundred years old just about feeling didn't matter so much to him but yet you're like brother Brian kept talking about how he was lacing those booties he had that all the little baby equipment ready because he believed it wasn't the feeling that had him walking it was the believing you know if I could if I could quote itami I was born out and Tommy Osbourne said it that God took the easy part over the hard part God took the hard part it gave you the easy part think about that you don't have to manufacture nothing you don't have to produce nothing you're looking at the statue perfect man you think that looks hard how am I going to do that you don't have to produce it all you have to do is believe it and God will do the rest you know it you know there's a lot of people today a lot of ministers around the world preaching hot preaching all that what women are supposed to do and we to do the dish and washing this this one kind of way and all this kind of stuff but I'm I'm a preacher a little something different night I'm a preacher than a spiritual bride a spiritual bride don't have to do nothing but show up to the wedding and she needs to show up to the wedding dressed in white she needs to show up clothes right so that with with the old man dead so there's nothing to impede the wedding but also you got to do it show up to that wedding like that story there brother Brown told about the waiting for the groom did the little the little bride waiting for the groom to show up on the book board book board and and one day he showed up so what was she knew she wasn't struggling and fussing and fighting and struggling with herself you know and and maybe you know Oh God you know all this just trying to trying to push it out but you know and the natural and the natural let me be carnal for a second so just bear with me but in the natural a baby is born by pushing the Midwife tells you to push the doctor tells you to push but this gospel baby is not going to be born by pushing it's born by the head pulling the heads pulling you were drawing you up so you don't have to push in fuss and Feud and everything with yourself or with God or whatever just relax and that's the problem when when you get hooked when the fisherman car tosses the hook out well what's the natural inclination of a fish the natural inclination of a fish's to this tougher to fight and run away and try to get away you know what God does is he just lay just wait for you to get tired out you're under this church over here you run to this church over here you run to this doctrine over here but after a while you come back to dead center and he's just waiting for you to get worn out and wait for you to come back to center line that's that's the problem with a fresh-caught gospel gospel trial as that thing they gotta they think they got to do all kind of stuff instead of just relax it and give it in relax and let the let the fish them and draw you into the boat you know talking about faith oh how can you stand I'll give you our faith brother I'm preaching the message perfect faith you have faith if there's something in the way so before you can have faith you got to have forgiveness if your heart condemns you you can't get what you're asking for if your heart condemns you you can't have faith so god can't move until you repent and that's why it's so important to repent and get everything out of the way that's why it's so important to confess your faults one to another because of you if you're holding grudges against one another and accumulating things against one another instead of accumulating the word then then there's something impeding your faith how can you have pure faith if there's something in the way go to your brother and ask for forgiveness say I've done something wrong and then you know when you have and when everything's clear when everything's out of the way and you can say within your heart that I don't have it there's no condemnation there's nothing in the way that you can have confidence when you approach God that's the way to have faith is you get everything out of the way and you said God forgive me people forgive me all of my acquaintances all of my family forgive me you know that's how you get the new birth to that's part of sanctification that's sanctify the walkers when you go around something within you is it's burning to get everything out of way so that you can have faith and God can come in get it all out of the way so that God can come in and you can have perfect faith and then you're a well on the way to being pulled in the boat you see where I'm going with three pools what's what's the third pool the third pole is to get you back in the boat and who's in the boat Jesus Christ to get you back into the boat where it from from where you came from because we know that brother brother Dale's brother Wade preached on Genesis 1:26 27 all these times Jesus talked about how he knew where he come from and John 17 he talked about the glory and and and he spoke about from glory to to oneness it's really what he was preaching on I know where I came from and I know where I'm going I know I'm going to perfect oneness and we know where we came from and we know where we're going if you've got the batteries in the Holy Ghost you came from God you're going back to God just like Jesus said I come from God I'm going back to God and you're going back to come out because you're doing being drawn back into the boat through those that 3 pool journey is God's Word is pulling you back into the boat so so Abraham started out in the city of Ur started out in Babylon started out by throwing down his idols started out by throwing out all that he's you know really you would say I used to believe that but something has happened to me and I don't believe that no more that's you know what it's such as such a strange thing for many people to grab a hold of that the opening of the word is going to take us out of here I was talking to somebody about that recently and they and they began to say well you do you mean to tell me that it sounds like almost like you're saying it's knowledge that you just accumulate knowledge no but what it is see God this kind of knowledge can't come just from study and like you're in a school setting or whatever but this kind of knowledge is when that that block drops into the slot and it begins to change your life and so that's what the experience I'm talking about how can you even approach to explain something like that unless you've lived it unless you've gone through it it seems Fanta funded fantastical to imagine that believing God's Word would produce him inside of you inside of you that allow him to tabernacle himself inside of your members that he would use your hands and use your feet and then you can yield yourself by just accumulating to yourself the word by studying and reading it and that would allow God to Tabernacle himself inside of you but yet it's true and so the next stage of Abraham's journey was there in Genesis 15 and I'm just preaching this and my time is Bob oh goodness that clock one day will be an eternity but for now we live we're living in two bound by time but in Genesis chapter 15 the next stage of his journey was what that person stays the same defied life and again I'm not talking about baby form sanctification but I'm talking about sanctification work you know if you look at the fare of the life of the Pharisees they didn't have you know all kind of they weren't going out and drinking alcohol and doing all that kind of stuff that's a lot of times we think that's what sanctification is that's that's part of it because when you when you're on your way to the new birth then all that alcohol drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes and and and and looking at pornography and doing things and probably you shouldn't be doing and doing stuff in secret cheating on you why let me tell you something if you got the baptism in the Holy Ghost you ain't gonna be running around on your wife around on your husband I'll tell you that right now you ain't gonna be doing the less stuff because that stuff goes down as sanctification which it seems like today there's a lot of confusion about whether it can somebody be born again and beats going around and cheating on their wife or something they'll hug the baptism the Holy Ghost that revelation that's inside of you if you've got the new birth that'll keep you from doing that that's that's just a bunch of nonsense and a bunch of trash to imagine if somebody could sit in church and say well I I'm alright to be sleeping around or whatever all that stuff goes out at the new birth all that stuff goes out of sanctification because God's cleaning you up it's cleaning you up so that you can be alone with nobody else knowing what's going on and you've been living the clean life because God God has cleaned you out but in this and this mature sanctification God begins to clean you out by the word so that you're not just just living that kind of a life right but now God's life the divine life is being formed in you so that when somebody looks at you even when you look at your own self you could say look there's no way that I could do that when I myself that had somebody slap you across the face as many of you have testified and you just turn with temperance temperance because God is in control temperance is when God something down the inside is in control it's not you patience where you're waiting on God not maybe not like he or she had to jump and try to jump to conclusions of things but you were waiting patiently for God to fulfill his word and you when that when all that begins today is making away excuse me how does this happen how does this happen because you were eating the word you're feeding on the word and what it happens is the mechanics that you're feeding on the mechanics make a way for the dynamics that's what the mechanics does but it seems like today a lot of people shy away from the mechanics they want the dynamics more than the mechanics but it's the mechanics that brings the dynamics if you want to have dynamics in your life get the mechanics first because if you don't have the mechanics there's nothing to quicken y'all pray for mama see the devils start battling my throat with that saw her how you know I'm reminded of that little story where brother Brown talked about the little chipmunk that was harassing the eagle they just kept chitter chatter and chitter chatter and you know you know brother Brown said that looks like the devil he'll just keep chitter chatter and trying to end tag and I try and do stuff but you know brother Brown if you read that quote he said he looked at that squirrel saying you ain't gonna do nothing so you don't you don't have to how do you get these virtues you don't have to press you don't have to frustrate your way into it that's how a lot of us think remember that story brother round talked about how Paul Rader Paul Rader told the story of how he had that dream and he he he in the dream his boss told him go cut that in that big old tree and he went and chopped on that tree until he fell over and he tried to pick it up and it began just struggle with it and he began to to realize there's no way I can pick this tree huh there's no way I can get this thing up and that's almost how it looks like when you look at something like this how how can I get this tree up how can I you know you remember about the word of the Lord is the ruble was I'll make this mountain flat I'll make it a plane I'll make it so you can you can do something with it and so so in the dream and the dream he heard a voice is just chop it down and there's a river right next to it they just just roll it over into the river and before long he was screaming I'm riding on it I'm riding on they like like those uh you've seen how in the old times when they log meals they would chop trees down and roll it over in the river and they would ride on it and so you know if you what it is is if you just give it over to God and put that burden down on the river put that whatever it is in the river how am I going to get over how am I going to get up the statue of a perfect man just give it over to God and before long you'll be riding on his promises before long you'll be riding oh you know so if you go if you go out of the barn Lord and look at a sheep he's not struggling to produce wool and maybe right after you you share it you might go to that sheep and say it's the heat of the day I don't see any wool on you and that she might say well just come back in the mother so just be patient and hang around a little bit and he might tell you that while he's just munching on some grass just sitting there lounging munching on some grass because let me tell you something that's how you grow that's how you grow as a Christian is all you got to do is just keep eating all that sheep has to do to bear wool let's just keep eating and all you've got to do is just keep eating a zebra has stripes why because that's in his genes he just keeps eating oh you don't have to do nothing to produce her stripes all he has to do is just keep munching what take any animal there is well as the giraffe got a long neck because it's in his genes and he eats and he just keeps munching and that'll produce because listen if you get the new birth it'll connect you right back with the genes of God which is what this statue for perfect man is and the more you eat the more the genes are expressed until it looks just like your father you look just like your father you think about all these all these struggles that Abraham endured that he was being purged and everything is being going from this way to that you know look at all the different mistakes that Abraham made as he was he had hooking his mouth but he went this way over here telling Abimelech that this is my sister and he went this way over here telling okay I'll you know try to have a child with Hagar and he went this way over here from one thing to another but finally God took him through his journey with that that he had that hook in his mouth if God's got that hook in his mouth he ain't gonna lose you you know I want to encourage you tonight that you're here for a reason you ain't you ain't here just for playing around I believe that everybody here tonight at least has a hook in their mouth if you say that's a dangerous way to say it brother brother ball that but I believe there's a reason that you're here that God you've heard the gospel call and you've you've done something with it something struck your heart and you've you're your own the way to that third pool you're on the way in the end what you have to do is just keep on believing and keep on eating and then Abraham finally got to Genesis 17 and when Abraham was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham to Abram Abram his name one changed you and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and beat out perfect you know what's important to notice right here Abraham started his journey walking and the middle he was walking and here he was still supposed to be walking he didn't stop walking just because he got to walk before me and be thou perfect he can't walk at home because there was a few more things left to come oh good I got so many more notes slow down keep walking walk he walking when you come all the way up the statue be perfect man see I'm still talking I'm still on yesterday we're looking back at you if you look back at your life at yesterday yesterday you that hook got in your mouth yesterday you your life beginning to be pursed yesterday and now now it's Adoption time sealed by the baptism the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost since the revelation of Jesus Christ personally you to you as you keep walking and walking that that that the Holy Ghost is dwelling within you is revealing the word to you and sealing these virtues in and you just keep walking and believing and now it's Adoption time let me let me pause for a second here you know just take a moment and maybe when you're driving home tonight take a moment to reflect upon your life because listen it's so easy today to say nothing's happening you know you can go out and look at the ocean and and it looks like nothing's happening but yet thousands and millions of gallons of water are being moved up into the atmosphere and it looks like it looked like nothing was happening when in the heat of the day when Abraham was sitting outside of his tent it looked like maybe nothing's happening all down through the seven churches as as people are being killed and martyred and all these different things and you come up to the end time and brother Branham preached his message and and now it looks like everybody in the message disagreed for a while that's what somebody told me is that how do I know what's church to go to how it seems like everybody's disagreeing but yet something's happening it might look like a lot of confusion but yet something's happening and all of a sudden that something will happen when you least expect it that's why he said beware be watchful because our cup the son of man will come as a thief in the night when you least expect it they'll be two in the bed and want to be taken and want to be left they'll be one of the two in the field won't be taken one will be left why because it's all of a sudden something's been happening all this time and many don't realize it and they miss what's happening oh I'm gonna skip over a lot in my notes come on now Genesis 18 is where where we left off with Abraham and he said and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre and he said in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked at lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground 25 years ago God and made a promise to a woman that was barren and a man that was an idolatry and Abraham began to walk toward that promise of a new city and toward geneology they would have nations would be born from him and and after all that time now the son of man comes upon the scene and they identifies him he identified that that change in ministry and brother Branham as he and brother Branham would turn himself to the to the audience and I and call out people's things call out the things that were happening in his life but I want you to just remember though that brother Branham is not actually on earth anymore and so where is the son of man to be identified you know this is this is the day when people can't make it's so hard people can barely even recognize who they are and this day I'm talking about anything and the carnal natural world you know you got oh now we got if you go to Target they got bathrooms for for people that are half in the middle somewhere I was listening to somebody talk about in England it was a psychiatrist saying that when people come to him to talk about their mental problems the number one problem is they don't know whether they're a man or a woman because they don't know what they are they don't recognize even who they are and so that's just in the carnal but and the spiritual now it's time to recognize who you are it's time to recognize the day that you're living in and what God is doing and so many myths what God is doing because they they haven't accumulated all this word over these years they haven't accumulated the word and been studying and eating and praying and seeking after God and so they're looking for the wrong thing they're looking for they're not looking for adopted sons the ways that the Bible explains it they're not even looking for the Baptism and Holy Ghost the way that the Bible explains what the baptism is what the born-again experience is they're they're not recognizing his presence how do you recognize his presence you know one time there was a infidel up there and in Kentucky that that didn't recognize his presence and he said I've been looking for him everywhere and I look out of this apple tree I look at all the different things and I don't see God anywhere and then a prophet visited it to them and he began to speak to him just common natural words and told him well oh he finally finished the conversation with all right well where what makes that SAP and the root of the tree go down into the root in the winter and make you come back up up in the spring what makes it do that well if I put a bucket on this fence post will it will it do the same thing and just that just exposing that and presenting the word to him calls that infidel to recognize the presence of God and that's what it calls you and I to recognize the presence of God in our midst to recognize him Tabernacle and you is the word for this day you know this message will not given just to just a tickle our ears but it was given to make a way for Christ to have complete dominion in you too because like I said the mechanics make a way for the dynamics and the mechanics make a way for a full restoration I mean read some quotes here let's go to 6a and Abraham's grace come on that cloth they said he's doing the same thing to the seed of Abraham and they don't recognize that brethren see what I mean justification sanctification baptism and Holy Ghost placing of the son heir God dwelling in his church human flesh eating drinking like man the Holy Spirit God Himself dwelling in the sons of Abraham manifesting the same thing that Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom social idea the coming of the Son of Man do you get it let's look at 6b we would see Jesus he said what's God trying to show what did he do there that was God and a body of flesh showing that God would be where and just one individual in his church in the last days in a body of flesh a body of human beings in his flesh and would manifest the same thing because if the Jews had that that was the last sign that the Jews God that was the last sign that Abraham got before the fire fire fell and here it is down to the same time today and that was that promise that God gave in Malachi chapter 4 5 6 before the coming of the dreck great and dreadful day of the Lord becoming of the fire falling he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to that original faith of the fathers he's going to turn the hearts back to the original the original Apostolic face at the father's and how is he going to do it how is he gonna do it with that capstone message that the people will eat and receive and believe and it will restore us it'll it'll it'll wake us up it'll wake us up to recognizing the presence of God so we've talked about yesterday he's the same yesterday today and forever if he was the same yesterday he's got to be the same today but the Bible says at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I knew that day you'll have an understanding of who God is you'll have an understanding of what the Son of Man is at that day you'll know because the knowing is the evidence of the new birth knowing is the evidence of adoption knowing what's taking place knowing knowing that understanding that only God can give you is what is going to take us out of here first John 5:18 20 through 26 we know that whosoever is born of God standeth not but he that has begotten of God keepeth himself and that wicked one not touches him not we know that and the next person that verse 19 he says and we know that we are of God in the whole world lieth in wickedness we know that how do we know that by the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you and verse 20 he says and we know that the Son of God has come and has - given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life and brother Branham said and one of his messages that I'm working for this one purpose for you to recognize the presence of Jesus Christ think about that's the purpose of the whole message for you to recognize the presence of Jesus Christ and where is Jesus Christ today he's tabernacling you he's working in your members and I believe that rapture and faith is already here rapturing faith is already here but to get it you just have to examine the word that has already been brought because this is a referee fight see I brought my own proper brother Louise her after your faith is already here you just need to examine it you need to you need to examine it for a present tense of what God is doing right now today the way to get to way to recognize God's presence is to go back into the word and examine it all it takes for us to get rapturing faith is to go back into the message to go back into the Bible and examine it and see what it says to open it up and and peruse it examine the message for rapture and faith examine the scripture for revival because the bride is having a word revival everybody else is doing their thing but we're having a revival of the word I believe that the book is already open but if you want to find the proof of where the book is already open or not you just have to examine it get into the message and examine it find out whether it is it really is the shouts already come but whether or not it's it's coming to you takes examination the bride already has a message see all of a sudden these things are taking place all of a sudden the bride already has a message she just needs to examine examine it and see whether these things be true the third pool is already here Christ Himself is already here we just need to examine it and and feed on this word and you know looking around and how all the things are situated in the world you can see that the devil has positions he's positioned rulers he's positioned rulers all around the world put presidents and things in power he's got sodomites position I get all these emails at work about all the different programs and things that Sodom Isis all that they they get they've got all the different acronyms and things but you know if the devil is positioning all of those things in his kingdom then surely God is positioning adopted sons into their place now God is moving something into place God is situating everything's just working right in accordance with his will something is taking place today if he's the same yesterday he's got to be the same today and what's taking place today is is where we haven't received a message of just clotheslined religion or for women had to know how to wash dishes and things like that but we received a capstone message that's going to take us out of here it's going to take us through the third pool the third pool back in fellowship with him to take this right back in the fellas right back into the boat I'm trying to I'm trying to close up here let me see where I am Matthew 17 11 says and Jesus centers are said unto them allies truly shall first come and restore all things just kind of looking back at some Old Testament scripture some things that were spoken they have to be fulfilled in Malachi 4 5 6 my whole our sins you Elijah the prophet the revelation 10 7 all these scriptures that we're familiar with but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets the mystery of God will be finished when and this day today because he's the same yesterday today and forever the bride today the bride is not just keeping the word but she is the word she's not just keeping the word Huw remember when when that cloud appeared out there in Arizona and everybody back then they wondered what did that mean the coming of the Lord the coming of the son of man and yeah if you notice there's something very peculiar about that cloud because that cloud signifies ahead cloud represents the head of Christ coming back and we know that the seventh seal brings Christ back to earth God is coming back to earth so if that is his head if that is the head of God that that he showed you know as a symbol over the desert or whatever then where is the body because the Bible says that government shall be upon his shoulder the government will be upon his shoulder and that shoulder is the body the body is right here in front of me the body is typify Din you his body is here and his body is built up today I believe it's being built up it's being built up and we get I'm gonna close here in just a second hang on Genesis chapter 20 verses 1 to 2 it's forever and Abraham said of Sarah his wife talking Abimelech she is my sister and I been will let king of Gerar sin and took Sarah we know how that story unfolded there's a hidden he had an underlying story there why would a be Malik want to take an old lady because she had been changed back because a body change had taken place and that's forever that's what we're walking to we've come through through all of this journey of justification sanctification our spirit being lined up the baptism of the Holy Ghost all of these virtues sealed in but now it's time for a body change and these issues can go ahead and come forward you know I believe that if ever if you ever said in your heart to find something of God that God will give you the reality of what you're searching for in John 16:13 says howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come just like he showed Abraham that new city just like he showed the future home to brother Branham just how he's showing us the revelation of a body change we don't have to continue here but God has given us a promise that he will change our mortal bodies to wit the redemption of the body to understand that he will change your body that you didn't come from when you realize that you've been birthed from above thank you didn't come from Charles and Ella Branham like he said but you've been birthed from above you have received a word birth and it's taking you all the way up remember you know this is like a love letter this Bible is a love letter to you and now you can look back at it and remember you can see how all this time God's been trying to show you his love how he thought of you from the beginning the the beginning of the world before the foundation of the world when he was on the cross died and for you thinking of you and remember oh I just look back to yesterday do you remember him whew and you think about maybe tonight when you go home remember that the first time that that God spoke to you and how wonderful that was and how he just took you from chaos just like when he spoke that garden of evening to exist as he took the Garden of Eden from a place of chaos and to a place of order and that's just how he's taking your life because God really loves you and has always loved you and that's why he said the baptism the Holy Ghost into the church as a sign as proof that he loves you and wants to draw you back to himself he's been looking for you for six thousand years a me forever is real and God is real and the Holy Ghost is real I believe it but y'all just stand with me and we'll just go to the Lord in prayer and I'm just getting right there if you have a need would you just lift your hand up to the Lord we just believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever I know if he was if he was able to meet although all the ones in the need of a sham gar and Jonah up down in the belly of the whale and Daniel and the Lions in all of their knees that brother branham's need down there that cave think about everybody telling him you possessed by a devil and an angel came on the scene and all the times that all these things have been done if he was if he's the God of yesterday surely he's a God of today Lord God we just thank you so much for your love to us Lord Jesus we thank you so much for your grace to us Lord God Lord we think Lord Lord of the the word of the Lord is the rules is right grace grace crying under the headstone it'll be praise to take a sigh here grace God that you've given unto us Lord Jesus not by our works not by our own power and not by our own might Lord of the by your spirit Lord it's what will take us out of here Lord God I know that you're still the same yesterday today and forever you're still the great god of O Lord God the Lord you see never hand is lifted up to night Lord Jesus reaching up for you Lord God and you know every secret need Lord Jesus every secret desire and I know Lord God that you're still a bird I'm able to meet every need Lord Jesus you're still able to touch every heart or God and mend every broken path Lord God and I pray O God that you'll just minister to every need Lord Jesus every uplifted hand Lord God and lord help us Lord to keep walking Lord like you told Abraham their walk before me Lord Jesus we know Lord God that Lord you gave us a promise in the Bible that you would be a lamp to our feet and a light climb paths and all we have to do is just keep walking one step at a time Lord Jesus and you will lead us all the way up just like either edik walk with you he kept walking Lord God as you shone a light on the path God granted I pray your Lord that you'll give grace to us Lord Jesus grace to keep walking because I believe that's what's gonna take us Lord
