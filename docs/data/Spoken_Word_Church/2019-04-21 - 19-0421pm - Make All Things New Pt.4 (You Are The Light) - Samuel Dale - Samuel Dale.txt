thank you for touching some of these here Lord especially for the the ones that are Lord on up in age and all and we know that time has taking its toll upon these old bodies but that don't have nothing to do with the healing virtues of Calvary we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now have your way bless the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction we believe that father we thank you for it in Jesus name amen Revelations 21 I hope we can finish up today of what I want to try to bring on this and continue on then all right Revelation 211 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea now remember the future home is coming down over to around there in Israel so to me now that's what the emphasis is made and there's no more sea it's not doing away with water it's not doing away with all things but if you bring the city down over there there would be no sea cuz that's where a lot of your seas are Sea of Galilee sea of this sea of that is right in the Jerusalem area so I think it's just emphasizing uh no more sea because it'd be you know taken up in land of the city 1500 square mile city be a big old place all right and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband and heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more sorrow No More Death no more neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful all right stop in there then we'll go over to Matthew 5 13 and he's coming through the the the Beatitudes and uh Sermon on the Mount you know and uh I I like the Beatitudes is one thing the Beatitudes is what we ought to be what we're supposed to be beatitude be your attitude you know uh what we ought to be and what we're supposed to be right you are the salt of the earth but it's a salt have lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted it is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be Tren to underfoot of men you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word which when I always say that I'll drop off on something I generally have about five sermons left over but any anyhow we uh we try our best to finish up today I hope you enjoyed this morning's message to me it was uh to what I've been thinking on because see I believe in a positive attitude that's that's the main thing you know negativism gets you nowhere you call me on the phone I'm uh I'll I'll emphasize this one time I remember uh after we'd come out of the Baptist Church and and I had got real sick with a cold or something and and uh one of my former uh friends there with us in the church he came to see me and uh we talked and talked a while and after a while he said I come to see you thinking you're sick he said you're not sick I said well that's that's good so you know yourself you call me on the phone if I'm laying in the bed or where I'm laying how are you doing I'm doing great why because there's no need of being negative oh I'm just having all of this wowy brother fory says it wowy wowy woo you know man I'm just down and out and and all you know everything uh that that won't get you anywhere negativism is just a bad thing uh you know but positive uh you know uh you you go to the doctor I do and if he if he's positive I'm positive but if he's negative I'm gone just the best way to say it if he's negative I'm gone cuz I don't have to I don't have no need of nobody else you know I mean you get to be 78 79 years old you uh you got enough problems You Don't Need No Doctor to tell you how wrong or how bad you are you need somebody to try to encourage you on do it and I believe in a positive attitude I believe in a positive attitude about the word of God I believe in reading the word of God to not to try to figure out what it's saying you said well I like to know what it's saying don't worry about it it's saying it just read it so you try to figure out what it's saying you get lost in the whole terminologies and you'll try to make this say something you come up with something that is of no good to you no value but to read it as to what it says you know and and all and that uh you know what amazes me is that you get people that read the Bible and they can't tell you what the Bible's talking about cuz they're trying to find something like that but give them a newspaper give them a newspaper and about two days later ask them what's in the newspaper they'll tell you everything to the detail you know all about it see and I I just I'm I'm that point I believe in just saying what the word says and then just forget it because it it ain't going to help us none to be negative but it will help us to be positive all right now as I saying this morning the Lord Jesus said when he brought forth he said I am the resurrection and the life now I tried to emphasize the point because I knew this was tied together with these two messages in that uh I told you this morning we try to go in to the to that but we didn't get there so we just stop off but we'll pick up this afternoon to try to tie together our thoughts all right now what was we talking about this morning just as a second Martha was great in her understanding she had a good confession but her confession was always not positive in looking at what who she was talking to she was saying if you hadn't been here see then she said even though you're here now but if whatever you ask him he's going to give you she had a good confession that sound good but just remember that wasn't what he said why would he turn right straight to her and all of that point or she confessing all of her if you think it's so good and say I am the resurrection see to me he was declaring that he was the god of the word and that the god of the word was the resurrection all right he was declaring a positive statement of who he was the one that met Moses from the burning bush that said I am that I am stands here now to say I am the resurrection who's the resurrection I am all right see it wasn't looking for a god somewhere else or a thought or something else that Martha was looking for if you had been your if you know if you asked God now he'll give it to you he was saying MAA I'm the god of the word see th stood the resurrection Resurrection is not a a Doctrine or an idea or a thought it's a person right it's a person the son of man is the resurrection sign all right the son of man is the Resurrection The Lord Jesus had the resurrection sign cuz he was the resurrection all right and I told you all the way down through time we didn't have a lot of things but when it come over to the end of it isn't it odd to Here Come the son of man right back into view brother brandom had the resurrection sign what bring me 24 of your worst cases and I'll guarantee you healing that was the resurrection sign the resurrection sign is never negative it's positive it's complete it's finished so we need to say what the word says about us all brother R said one day like this he said he had confidence in what God Said or in who God who he said that he was all right see then think about the word when he said I am the resurrection if that God lives in you no wonder your Prophet would say that your Resurrection lays inside of you right but like I said he said it lays inside of you and your spirit then he turn around and explain soul and what happens this that and we're still it's in my spirit it is not in your five senses those need the new birth it's in the spirit of God is where the resurrection lies all right because that's the word Made Alive all right get that hold on to that thought now then as we go along all right a positive attitude of who he was the prophet said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for all right that sounds pretty positive right that sounds like you know what you're doing even Satan cannot Prevail against that he just he don't understand it when when you're sick you're hurting like everything somebody ask I'm I'm wonderful thank god sister Johnny always says well I woke up this morning that's a good point you know I woke up this morning amen you know what a lot of people didn't wake up right so that's a positive attitude and having that about the whole thing we don't have to make ourselves [Music] we don't have to make ourselves something that's that's my whole has always been my emphasis it's not to try to make yourself something it's to be what God wants you to be don't worry about it he'll make you he'll bring you to the right place well brother d one of these days we're going to we're going to get this great Revelation one of these days we're going to do where's it coming from go on your internet and find out you got it on there now Plum full of what people thinking they found this great nugget they found this great thing we are against the the Brites we're against this that or the other they think they found some great thing to to destroy the message is what God wants now how can you do that I told you 50 almost 50 years ago that don't you worry about the the methodists and the Baptists and the Catholics and the Protestants and whatever it can't be there it's got to be right among our ranks because it's got to be where that that that party is all right now but see think about it he declared that he was the resurrection now he didn't declare it was coming or would be or maybe thought he declared that he was the resurrection and being that resurrection and the life all right now he declared that to be I want to get kind of backward to what I want to do so Brothers if you will uh go to number 11 because I've promised this it's in the message part but I promised it cuz I make statements and sometimes I don't declare brother randam as what he said so you wonder whether it's true or not but I want you to than about something when we get around to this in the end of it I'm a kind of a person that likes uh for things to be in an order you know and and line up in an order uh what you call it series of events or whatever so what I can understand and follow that I want it to be that I can see it and then I'm not confused like I've always said to you you think it's crazy but if you'll listen you'll hear a lot of these statements that I make where people would say you know make statements about something and and it be so odd and brother random would say you know if I don't see you no more just as an example I'll see you in the Millennium next thing to happen is the Millennium he just said it I don't see you any more see you no he just said that as a lot takes place before the Millennium that's right see but we take our own thoughts or concept about what he's saying and then we wind up in bad shape so I found this years ago and it ties into the message that we're in and I wrote this down and I would advise you to write it down or mark it somewhere I got this one written in the front of my Bible because it's all for questions and answers book four 1964 8:30 evening he gives an order of events to to take place all right then let's let's stay with that part they asked him a question the church ages ending uh blacked out the brides call we've already entered into the tribulation period now that was their question look he says no no no I wish I could just have more time on that so now watch him now he's going to give a series of events he's going to explain why that it's not to the point that we've entered the tribulation period because at that time there was a lot of time before the tribulation period would have to take place so now look to his answer the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease well when will the search a see when the bride is taken from the church well I think it ended over here it ended about 2 or three years ago because of the of this this that I don't care what you think you not care what I think he just explained something to you if You' listen that's what I'm saying Ride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease lady goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin now I ain't going to get into no Daniel 70 weeks with you but that is a valuable point that you've got a tribulation for the sleeping virin and you got a tribulation for Israel but that's all right so day if you request it I'll try to take back up again on maybe some of these things but I just preach what I preach and if it's 1980 when I preached it I don't believe in preaching it no more unless it's needed if you want to hear it all right if you don't want to hear it forget it that solves a problem with me look lady OA goes into chaos the bride into glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and five years while Israel is getting its prophecy I you then tribulation sets in upon Israel and then comes the battle of Armageddon 1 2 3 4 which destroys all things then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years Millennium right the millennial reign after that comes the white Throne judgment after that comes the new heavens and new earth you might think he's off about new Heavens Isaiah says Heavens John says Heaven and Earth read Isaiah 65 I think it it says Heavens comes the new heavens and new earth and the new city coming down from God out of heaven eternity and time Blends together now that's a series of events this happens that happens this happen that happened that's the way I like to look at things see then somebody come along and say like could say the statement well I don't see you no more I'll see you in the Millennium that wasn't what he said well I got to quote you got to quote but you quoted it because there's the ser events why don't you search out and let him answer it what comes after what the only one he left out of there is Gog and Magog Gog and Magog is the final battle right before the new heavens and new earth comes into being all right now but think about that and you just take that home with you because I want to I want to conclude something this afternoon if we can CU we've been talking for quite a while about the things to take place and how that it'll be one day that in the future home all right in the Millennium you have days nights and different things all right in the future home outside the city you can have days and nights and things but in the city you have no night all right you have no Temple you have a temple even built in the millennium but in the future home you have no Temple because the Bible says that the lamb is the temple you have no need of light because he is the light right now you said well well how will that be if there's no n no no light or nothing well let's just think about these things just for a minut minute with a thought in mind in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth now drop back into the message we'll run through today in a quick hurry so don't worry about getting bored we'll try to keep up in a hurry all in Genesis God created the heavens in the Earth all right we read that it was without form and void and darkness was upon all right then we've read there in Genesis 1 where God created light okay you go down a few more that was day one you go down a few more verses and you'll find out that the sun and the moon was created on the fourth day all right so what was created when it said light light was created the first day let there be light was it dark did God exist in a Darkness well yeah I guess he did it was dark without no God never existed in darkness there's no such thing as I tried to illust straight strike one match in a in a closed up building it sets out the darkness of that building that's all it takes is one match and it stretch it out all right see so what was the first creation that would that he'd be dealing with is light okay God created light did he was it so dark to let just become Darkness then he cre creates light or is that just a terminology or a thought of an expression because where God is there is no Darkness right did he exist in a world or a thought or a concept of darkness no that's what we're reading but in reading that we're doing what I said we're reading trying to find some Secret thing instead of just reading it and letting it say what it's saying to me that's simply saying that God is to come into being to be comprehended by mankind he's going to bring himself into being to where he can be comprehended all right so it's not giving a Darkness as a Darkness it just simply trying to express a point to opposition of light so what was that first light but it was not the moon and the stars it was not the Sun and the Moon that was created on the fourth day read your Bible see what is that light then your Prophet says it like this the first thing go ahead with number one we'll just read a few of these and then we'll drop off from questions and answers on Genesis he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creation of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came to logos which was a Son of God then out of the logos which were the word in the beginning was the word and now it comes the man now as I said we think we read that it says it was without form and void all right now then if you're going to go that cornal with reading your words of natural things then read that statement the first creation was God [Music] himself did God create [Music] himself well that's what it says what did he create himself from [Music] I'm trying to illustrate the point of looking at something and thinking we know what we're talking about and would read and it says it was without form and void and darkness was upon so we look at dog all that's just a simple point of illustration to connect your human mind to a point to show you because at that time God creates himself [Music] brother R said how could God create himself when he's the Creator remember that out of the church age book when he's the very Creator [Music] himself it's expressing something it's trying to explain something that is unexplainable right is trying to bring the human mind into a situation that we can start comprehending so why not say it like this the first creation was God as he begin to condescend not a creation of a creation that comes into great when he begins to condescend so we can [Music] understand now you're getting the light not the moon and the sun over on day four leave that out of it so you're coming to light in other words what are you coming to understanding God is opening up understanding of mankind and he writes in his Bible showing to the mankind how he's coming into being to reveal himself to the man amen go remember now according to my understanding Moses wrote this which that would have been a few hundred years after the maybe a couple of thousand after the original creation and what it was and Moses is told to write what this to try to help the mankind that had already lived 2 or 3,000 years because isn't Moses don't he fall After the flood don't he fall after the first 2,000 and do it right and after all that said and done when he comes over and he says Moses now you just pick up a pen and start writing How could a Moses wrote and God was and God is going to now reveal himself he couldn't put that in terminologies words I'm trying to get your thought to line up on something then your Prophet comes along and he picks up what all of these have said about Moses and Israel and what does he say he said and the first thing God created was himself that's not him taking mud and building up in a pile and jumps into it and it becomes it took a long time to transmit about 4,000 years to transmit down to flesh right so let's don't get so big of a wang bang out of it and run off you understand what I mean it took God all of those years to be able to bring into being himself that we could understand him so the first thing he created was himself now look go to number [Music] two they talking about what connection ises Genesis 1 and 2 he says you no the connect it's it's explaining it watch him and if you notice come on up if you notice in creation the first thing that was created of course was light you come on down through the creation like thing created was a man now he says it's light this is out of the same book so now you got God's first creation is himself now you got his first creation is light that must be the same person or thought or concept however what you want to put it it's simply explaining to me is how that God condescends to humanity for Humanity to understand him so he C to sins he comes down to the logos the theop the great big words that we use so than to might try to let everybody think how smart we are but yet we come down to the to the point like I asked the question one time we're talking about son of God I said when the Son of God appear in in Bible terminologies he said well 2,000 years ago I said that's how much you think God when it was called a Son of God was the logos back in Genesis that your Scholars knew because it's known as word or logos or speech the son of God trying to get a point to you just think a positive point of thinking light will put Darkness out true all right so as God unveils himself light becomes into view our thought or to our understanding but we don't want to leave him as Darkness cuz he never was as Darkness but put it to the point that he's now trying to let himself be known as light then he can create the moon and the stars and the sun later and let them control and all and we call that light but that was not what God created in the beginning so he never created he stepped over into another form he amored himself changed his form from being unseen to where he can be seen and the first thing comes forth is light light is what brings it out out into the open to be able to be seen but it's dealing with the mind more than it's dealing with an actuality of well it was see it was dark and then it become light and then see when Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life he was showing us that he was that very God that created all things back in Genesis and that he was the light all right you remember we brought these out as God tries to unveil himself he begins to bring himself down and when Moses which had written this part you know in his writings after he got through writing the things he was writing he built put it in her skin the things that God told him to put into being right and he made the Ark of the Covenant he made all of the thing he made everything to lay it out he laid out the outer Court inner Court holy of holies and there he was in that very chag of Glory that behind that veil of the inner Veil you know you didn't need no [Music] light God is still trying to reveal himself trying to make your known you didn't need no light you had to have light in the outer court because it was day and night all right inner Court going into the second part you had the candlesticks they had to be kept lit but behind the veil there kind of Glory how many of them do you want where brother B says never did go out year after year you had to relight them candles you had to do all them things but that high priest when he would walk behind there he didn't stumble all over everything it was light brother R said a soft glowing light when time he called it smooth I got a bunch of them written down of what it was behind the veil but just remember it was light what was happening the god that created all things and unveiled himself as light in the beginning he's going to stay light but he's going going to try to express himself as light all [Music] right it's a smooth light and he lived it was there all the time day and night he walked in the light of the Living God what about it what kind of a supernatural light was behind the veil brother random said on one of them I've got in here somewhere or maybe last week's notes cuz I've had these a while he said that light was a rainbow well now what if today in our day what do you recognize or relate as a rainbow come on ain't nobody going to say it it ain't too good of a sign today right rainbow ain't too good of a sign but you know to Noah it was a great sign it was a covenant it was light light was the rainbow color but yet we think don't want well I just don't like that rainbow color well I F have been Noah I'd for love it I mean i' sure love it would you I love it too because I remember when I was a kid I was told you know like everybody's always told their kids these stories and that's why I get on to you for don't scare your kids with your thoughts about God when you can't put them together anyway but you scare your kids with about these things they had told me that when the end of the world had come that there would be a great big cloud come up in the sky and it' just be so dark until it would just be and it would the world would just end well every time it come up a cloud I went out in the yard right cuz that's what I was told but you know what I saw a lot of clouds come and go and I never did wind up the end of the world but see we take and we just take words and thoughts and ideas and and just throw them out and we don't consider how in relation that it can have to mankind as I said to Noah with a rainbow Covenant beautiful thing in the sky that day you go out anytime you want to take your water hose you wash in your car and you just take it and you just spray it across like that and there's the prettiest rainbow you've ever seen brother Tom faush and us we used to ride around a lot on Sunday afternoon and one Sunday we left and went down by the house and we got about almost a mazille and there was just this rainbow I mean it was just so much till it just went from one side of the Earth to the other you know you don't see a lot of that you generally see parts or what I ain't talking about no little old bitty you know you could barely make out I'm talking about beautiful rainbow colors and we life remarked about it went over to comeer stopped and got us about to eat we came out and uh we were looking and I was still back but it was only just parts of that rainbow you know but it was still beautiful it was not just like youd see just a little bitty one it would had the real dark colors you know in it so we get in the car and we start driving up the expressway well all at once I said I've always heard that at the end of the rainbow was pot of gold you ever heard that well you know what come why she'll verify this right off the side of the road was the prettiest rays of light coming down and it did it looked like that that they wasn't a green tree they was nothing it was just gold all around that place well that was light we begin to find out it was no gold there cuz we had the gold riding in the car with us he was inside of us all right what about the light the sh kind of Glory would put forth a light you know that would lighten up the whole room that it was in well do you think that if you put it outside somewhere that it would run out of light because according to what brother R says in the future home that that light can be seen all over the whole world you read the book all over the whole world you say yeah but that's down on the dark side all right you explain what I'm talking about and we don't worry about what where it's down there I used to think I used to think if you dug too deep in a well you'd fall out the other side what' you think they used to tell us that people on the other side of the Earth was hanging upside down that's why their eyes was slanted so you're silly I agree with you but that's what it was told us didn't necessarily make it true but listen I'm trying to express about a light a light that the Shak Glory was just a partial telling of it the rainbow is just a partial revealing of it but the Lord Jesus as I said this morning bringing out when he said I am the resurrection you know he said I'm the light right he said I'm the light well listen was he but did he have this great glow around him that lit up the buildings and the world and everything as he walked that evidently wasn't what he was talking about but he said he was the light of the world and he said let's see as long john let me get my glasses we I going to read the scripture John 9 and5 as long as I'm in the world I am the light of of the world is that physical light John 8 and12 he says I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but she'll have the light of life read it the light of Life Matthew 5:14 he said you are the light of the world right now he goes here through the scriptures to bring us to the point that he's first telling he's the light as long as he's here there'll be light but then he declares you're the light well he's evidently talking about the same light right I mean wouldn't you think so we used to sing them little songs you know them little children This Little Light of Mine I'm going to let Let It Shine kid still do it here on some time not going to blow it out not going to put it under a bush not what is the light that could be talking about that could be what he was that could wind up to be the same in you and me that we could be the light it would have to be the light of Life did you read that light of Life he's the light of life but if he lives in us then we're the light that's why I love the thoughts a prophet would bring he said he's not complete without us even says the godhead right is that quote godhead is not complete without you you realize if you took out one candle you would have a problem huh well it's still light now it ain't to he ain't complete without us you know why cuz here's where he's living he what would be the word used moved or transported or descended or what from being the fact of existing alone and then you see him as he comes forth and he's declaring himself as to all of the things throughout the four gospels but the main point he's bringing is you're the light that took place on the day of Pentecost right not talking about natural light now I got them in here if you want to do them you know that you the human being go ahead to number eight cuz we're going to separate a little bit from cosmic light to Eternal Light under Cosmic light now watch from the uncertain sound when you were made when you were made and they just found out recently that your body is full of light x-ray proves that the X-ray does not have any light of its own now they'd probably argue with you down at the at the doctor's office but we ain't worry about the doctor we know who the doctor is it's your light that it uses they have proven they have taken pictures and proven of people holding their hand out to touch another person and Rays of light moving right is that blind to anybody or you understand that's what they've done it now watch it's your light that it uses you're born with four Rays most of us is done past it's your Li to uses you're born with four Rays after a little while say 20 25 one ray goes out 35 another or 40 another one goes out and finally when you get past about 65 you're living on your last R now in case you missed it you're going on down below it he said now that's Cosmic light he's explaining natural light it is not the Holy Ghost lighting up there that's in every human being Cosmic light but it gives the point Earth thought to look at that you mean to say that within us as human beings created The Way We Were and brought into being then God put a cosmic light there right now if he put a cosmic light how much more light would it be with the baptism of the Holy Ghost goes when it says ye are the light of the world it ain't talking about Cosmic light now come on when the Bible says you're the light of the world ain't talking about Cosmic light ain't talking about X-rays and pictures taken it's telling you what is exactly what I just said the only way you and I can be light is for that original light to come in us and live in the new birth that's why the new birth is the most important thing there is amen the Bible speaks of how that your body see I got that in you yeah your body is full of light but that's Cosmic Cosmic light which is means some way some Ray some point some thought that God done and he put it into the human being now it ain't no glowing light that it's like Eternal Light bub on and you know it's life within us is life right now get the point is I said then if that is light and even Cosmic light will show up what about the Holy Ghost that's living within you see it ain't going to be Cosmic light in the future home you know what I me ain't no need of cosmic light in a future home the future home there is no light because he's the light well if he's living in every one of us then you're the light that's what he was speaking of when he said you're the light of the world now Naturally Speaking what does he saying first off the point what he's saying if you're the light there's no way that anyone can see God except through somebody else now I saw God it now I tell you what I never didn't hear a preacher and I got born again you heard somebody because it's impossible to be born again without hearing the word that's right right so our light right now is to let our light shine before men that they they see God is that scriptural let our life what did we read that in a while ago life lot of life you see why your life is so important you see even what I was talking about a moment ago when I talking about simple plain thing that if we're negative we got a DM light right we're all down and out we've got a dam light but if you're happy and joyous your light glows so Jesus was saying to us all right I'm going to give up my life we've come down I've explained it to you I've brought it to Moses I told Moses all about the creation brought it through I brought it through the shakana glory I brought it through all of the lights and brought it through the the rainbow I brought it through the fact you remember what it was it was in in the daytime it was it was a rainbow or a pillar of fire and at night then it it was a light or a cloud excuse me daytime was a cloud and night it was a pillar of fire the light that's how they knew where to go where they wanted to go was by that what are you saying I'm saying church when are we going to realize that the life we're living before the people of this world is the only light they'll ever see of God they said can't see God they see Cosmic light they see rays and things like that and they try to make it something great the greatest light there is is to let your life shine before men to be a Christian every day you live right remember that's the only God a lot of people see is you right I remember working with these two women in the cotton Mill New Holland Mill I worked with him a couple of years and this lady she went come unglued one day and told everybody off I wasn't a preacher back then but I tried to live a decent life and we're over there working a little bit and she comes she said Sam I'm sorry I apologize I shouldn't have got mad said all them things I said oh that's all right I said that's that's okay I said we all have our good days and bad days she said Sam said I've been with you two years I've never seen you down well maybe that's a good point but you've heard your Prophet expressing it right that the people see God in you and want to be like that right we want our children to live like us and do like us God wants his children to do that light so when we get to that future home the Bible says you have no need of the light say because the lamb is the light you have no need of a temple he said because God is the temple is it doing away with things or is he coming back to where he originally was now I'm stopping on that point where you'll think see that's why I don't believe that there was a Darkness like we read I don't believe that I believe that's the terminologies or statements of humanity to describe things I believe when God existed alone he was light cuz the Bible says that in him is no Darkness he didn't come from Darkness to light there never was a darkness in his presence the future home to me is going back to the closest we'll ever get I said that the way I meant it I mean it the way I say it the closest we'll ever get back to originality is the future home I believe that why would you want to go any further I get so tickled at listening to people preach on predestination I I I get tickled at it I I don't mean life I just life at the humanity of what we are and they predestinate so predestination be careful if he was self-existing you could predestinate Yourself clean out of existence you better stop a little before that it gets to self-existing I don't want to go any further than the point that he said let there be light that you follow my thought I don't want to go any further back the predestination carries you back and if you go back to pre-existence you've predestinated yourself out of existence because it's pre-existent he'll never be pre-exist he'll never exist alone I've got the quotes from The Prophet you need that he'll never be self-existing right why because he's got his family in that future home will be the closest position of anything about any and all of your predestination because you'll live with him for eternity you said well I just can't understand out okay I'll give you another one if you can't understand it tell me how he's my savior he's my father he's my brother he's my husband he's my Advocate you explain to me how all that's true out of one person am I right he's my brother he's my father he's brother brother said he's easy with my mother what about it church just trying to make a little point to end of thought I'm trying to end it right there I'm ending it with that last thought let's don't predestinate our eles out of existence I don't want him to go back to the place that he exists alone I want to go back to the place that we can exist in eternity with him so what did we wind up Bing Sunday we talked about it the Earth will be made Eternal he said well I don't believe that okay that's your problem it ain't mine I mean it ain't mine I'm just stating it the world is to be made Eternal because it's to be made a new creation he makes all things new all right so then if the world's eternal and we got an eternal city right the future home build according to your desires and thoughts that's your home you're going to live in it for eternity if we can reach that place I don't want to go any further right I don't want to go no further than a total eternity existing with my father existing with my brothers and my sister as a part of the family of God there won't be no need of a light cuz he's the light if one match can put out all the darkness and it's a kind of Glory can be glowing so great until it never goes out what about a day when we get there you're the light if he's not complete without us then if he goes back to that self-existing I go out of existence but he'll never go to self-existing you go back to his original thought of what he wanted what did he want a family Sons and Daughters to be like him come on church I don't agree with it of it being but it is so amazing how that your movie Industries and things can can try to portray the things and that was so great with brother brandham until when he seen that Ten Commandments and seen how they done that writing he knew that it happened some way and that related to him till he he enjoyed that thought of seeing that and if any of ever seen it it was evidently they done it with powder or something and put it there and let it just burn out and it just and he just wrote them letters in stone he said that's just exactly like it was I don't want to go to self to where he goes to self-existing I want him to be my father I want to be the son he wanted I want to be the person he wants me to be cuz that way then if I'm part of him then he's not complete without me but now come on let's get to Life's part if I'm part of God and you're part of God then we're part of each other whether you like it or not brother Dale I don't want to be a part of you well that might be true in the cosmic light area of time I'm might not want to be part of you but when we get all of that out of the way and we all get eternal life ain't going to be no worrying he said I never thought when you started that series on life that you'd wind up there where we wound up back as far as I want to go and I don't want to go no further than the point of being able to stand with my father and let him be made manifest through me and we can stand there as light not glowing balls have to hang around say about you see these uh movies what do they make them now come on kids somebody help me like what they call it Mortal Combat if I'm wrong on these things I don't watch it so I've just seen the points of whatever magazine got about and they claim those people are so great until they're just invisible they're just going beyond anything could be comprehended of them and they're totally invisible that's why they call it Mortal Combat they can't be killed and church they're pretty close I remember brother Harris telling about that they showed in a movie one time because you go to so many degrees you get first degree second goes up to eight I think it is they have no more fighting and they showed this big old 2,000lb bull this was supposed to been out it charged the guy he just stepped aside whacked his horn off the bull turned to charge and coming back full speed he stood dead still when that bull got to one spot pop Right Between the Eyes the bull fell on the ground you want to run in front of a 2,000lb car it's going to knock you a long ways my point there are things that these human beings you tell me David didn't know these things now I've always argued this you can argue all you want I ain't going to argue about I'm just tell my point see David knew all about karate and all of these things he wasn't no little old thing we hear brother brandham and I agree he said that demon up there could have tore him to pieces but just remember you're also talking about a guy that had won 15 professional fights but he knew them professional fights wouldn't no good cuz there was a demon out there that was more capable than all of them natural combats would you tell me David and them didn't know about karates and thing what are you saying I say I'm looking at the light of the world but I'm looking at the body of Jesus Christ there'll always be light that's why we can agree and talk to each other about Christ and life and doing is because we're his children we get to that future home all will be Eternal We'll Be Eternal now with him what a day those we talking about this morning he said I am the resurrection I didn't emphasize that about me and you right but this evening I'm emphasizing one thing he said I'm the light of the world as long as I'm in the world he said I'll be the light of the world when he left this world he came back into the Bride of Jesus Christ and the light has never went out ye are the lot of the world light can't be put under a bush or what it's set on a hill he knew where that future home was going to be set on the hill Mountains will cleave and up it'll go the mountain do see you be gone cuz it won't be no more seea in that area what about it come on musician
