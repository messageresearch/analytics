good to see all you smiling faces pray for brother louise he got he didn't get caught in an accident he got caught in an accident there was an accident and he got caught behind it so they couldn't move they've been sitting there for an hour or so so i think they they turned around and went back home so they're watching in so um no i don't think i'm going to use it tonight i think we're we're just going to review a little bit though and but i think that you got it in your in your mind what we're trying to um whether you believe it or not it's sure it's left up to you but uh i just i just feel that we're coming to a time that um all those years that brother dale and all the different ministers kind of fought through the bushes you know now we should have a pretty clear path to get to where we're going hey man it's a lot better to have a road cleared out for you before you get started you can make it down a four-lane highway really good but when it narrows down to a two-lane and then when it gets down to a one lane and then when it gets down to a dirt road and you gotta get out and pick up sticks to get them out of the road you should understand what i mean that's how they started with with all people throwing sticks and rocks in the road you know but now i think we're on a four-lane highway i i think that that it's time that we don't have we're not looking for another profit we're not looking for another message we're just looking to get out of here we're looking that we're looking at a time that um you know we get up every morning with something new something's going on here or something's going on there or something pops up here or something pops up there but the eternal word of god never changes and as i said many times before we are going to make it we may be brother brown said we will be battle scarred veterans we will not be sitting up there with uh um we gonna have i got out in the garden for the first time today and i got a blister so that's the way it is with the gospel we're gonna have blistered hands and and uh but we'll be sitting there across the table and somebody look over and say how in the world did you make it through the worst darkest age even though we've got the most intelligence we've got tv we've got um you know we can carry the message in our pocket what you know john wesley and all those they would love to have all their head have had all their messages in a little cassette player or something they could put in their pocket and review with their because you know what john wesley would would preach a sermon and then he would go somewhere else there was no recording of that it had to be by the spoken word somebody had to relay it to someone else so me and you we can get a question in in the word of god we can number one turn to the word of god then number two we can you know go to the um table or folio views and there's the message and there's the quote and there's the you know so we shouldn't be um we shouldn't be where we say i don't know anymore we should be that we know that we know that we know amen by way of announcement just remember that next sunday brother dale will be doing both services so pray for him brother bob will be gone brother luis will be gone to jacksonville florida and i will be leaving saturday to go to brother richard heights in kentucky we'll be back on wednesday just pray for us they're calling for a little snow up there so it's okay also communion will be on the 21st which will be not this coming sunday but the next sunday on the 21st of february we will have communion all right and also remember to keep everyone in prayer all of us that are traveling it's supposed to get really cold this week here it was 60 degrees and sister cletus said ladybugs were flying everywhere well the ladybugs don't come out when it's cold but they better get back in because it's going to get cold this weekend so welcome to georgia weather if you don't like it wait 15 minutes it'll change right so thank god we're going to a place that we don't need a thermometer we don't need a thermostat amen it's all going to be exactly the way you want it and the way i want it so it's already been prepared before the foundation of the world so if you've got your bibles turn to the book of hebrews nine we'll continue we're just going to review today we brought a few more quotes on eternal redemption and i hope that i hope that you're listening anyway because to get this to get anything going right what's the first thing you got to have a good foundation gotta have a good foundation to go from adam to the future home you've got to know where adam is you got to know where you are you got to know where moses was you got to know where all these different players in this great plan of god you know god just laid it out here in the bible for us but man has so um watered it down and moved it around and that's why god had to send a prophet so that when we can read malachi 4 luke 17 30 we know that's for us we know that was the end time people and that matthew 28 19 doesn't contradict acts 2 38. amen so we know that and we you know i just rest my soul on that right i rest my soul on this message being right and and i just can't rest it on nothing else um i'm not looking for anything else so if you're not looking for anything else tonight then let's hone in on what we got amen take what we got prophet god said in in these tapes lies rapture in faith he didn't say own them he said in them in these tapes lies rapture and faith not just quotes because like i said quotes will kill you but not when it becomes life when it becomes live now i tell you though when it becomes live it's going to be like jesus we'll talk a little about that maybe later on when jesus became the word made flesh they called him a devil right so when you take what's on this paper and you walk it and live it people are gonna hate you because they're not gonna they're gonna say well why are you doing this and why are you doing that well it's because the word of god's inside of me i'm i'm trying to become the word of god amen being a son and daughter of god so hebrews 9 verse 11 and 12 let's go to the lord in prayer dear heavenly father thank you today in the middle of the week that we have a little time set aside lord that we can worship in spirit and truth we pray now that you would come and be the active participant in this service you do the speaking lord and you also do the hearing as far as the people sitting in their seats lord they they do not know what i'm going to say next but lord you do and maybe lord you can give them a little spark into their that theophany that we're talking about that come from you lord then as the prophet said the word meant the word so we want to do that tonight let the word meet the word father and when we do that then there's nothing satan can do about it he hates the word but when the word meets the word the prophet of god even says when two omnipotents meet something has to happen so we pray lord we all have needs in this church right now lord physical needs spiritual needs our children need have needs our grandchildren have needs we have children that are lost we have all the different things lord we pray that you just during this time of this um from now till the end whenever you come lord that you'll just work in their life lord just don't let them sleep until they find you lord we pray that you would just be with each one now bless us in jesus name amen what a wonderful thing if we had everybody here all you kids didn't have to worry where they were had all your grandkids didn't have to worry where they were you just keep claiming them because you know what if you don't claim them how they gonna come you gotta keep claiming them you gotta keep claiming them keep claiming them put the token over them right you know ask ask some of these that have come back to the lord you place the plate place the token over them and they're like joshua's like leave me alone you know i mean you get caught at every turn and every not me i can't be with you all the time but you know i know somebody that can't right right bro zack but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building so in other words we know that the old testament was a type and i've been reading in leviticus for my morning devotion and and man i tell you they had to give everything exactly right everything had to be done in order aaron had to do things in order the priest had to do things in order the sons had to do things in order they had to separate um all the different parts of the animal it wasn't like they just threw the thing on there and then walked out the door no it was a job i'll bet you when those people were done they were tired but see they didn't have to minister like we brother brown says you know a preacher preaches a sermon it's like working eight hours a day right it is it's toiling and struggling and all the times that we to get the sermon and bring it in but the priest all they had to do was they didn't have to preach a sermon they would just but boy look at the physical work they had to do but anyway i just want just if you'll read those through you'll think man it's not as easy as you think just throw an animal up on there no they have to take the breast and the neck and to this and that because you know why the word of god told them to do it so how are you and i gonna get by that was my whole thought how are you and i gonna get by doing part of what the word says can't do that amen neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of word and we're gonna just run through these real quick these quotes that we've been reading i like to read them anyway because it's the word of god phoenix arizona 1955 brother brown said job the oldest book in the bible was supposed to be even written before moses wrote genesis but the oldest book in the bible was speaking of redemption yet redemption was way before that redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even before the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of that god foreseeing there's that four knowledge we were talking about sunday and making a way of redemption before he even made the world because he knew we were going to fall he could by foreknowledge know what we were going to do so he had it laying right there for adam and eve but it wasn't adam and eve pulling them through a tube it was adam and eve with a tree of life and a tree of knowledge of good and evil they had a choice to make from the get-go they had a choice to make even cain cain had a choice to make even when he killed abel god said if you'll do this you'll be fine if you don't do this if you do this or don't do that sin lies at your door so the plan of redemption had to be laid out before the foundation of the world because god knew we were going to mess up immediately amen he knew that but that's okay because that started the plan of redemption i was thinking today you look at that plan of redemption you know he laid the thing out just like you and i would lay a plan out even though we sometimes lay a plan out and change it god can't change his but he's still in his mind he laid out a plan and that plan to me was written in 66 books of the bible pretty simple but very profound because they still take this 66 books of the bible and preach all kind of doctrines out of it so you got to get the love letter that's why we needed a prophet coming the end time to give us eliezer to give us the love letter between us and christ amen yes praise god for that right brother titus let's read verse 2 and hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promise before the world began i want to ask you a question on that one who did he promise it to there was nobody there he promised his self and we were inside of him when he promised him i'm going to have children i am going to have a world i am going to have people that will worship me i'm going to have this and that and the others see promised before the world began but hath in due times manifest his word through what preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our savior which i was talking about the apostle paul so let's go to ephesians one let's just go ahead and get some of these out of the way and then we won't bring the chart out tonight but we're just going to recap let's go to verse 4 save time according as he has chosen us in him remember he chose us in him we you say no now you said you don't have a choice you don't have a choice when it comes to that but the reason he chose us in him was as he saw you choose him down here right now amen is that all right we're chosen in him by foreknowledge not by just remember he can't he didn't shoot chose donny and not choose daddy but he knew by foreknowledge that he could put it in a place where donnie could get it and even put it in the place where this one could get it and he didn't want it that's why brother brown said predestination is hard because predestination is just like walking down that aisle it's just predetermined and being predetermined god could write the bible before the foundation of the world but he didn't write the bible making people do what they do i mean he hardened the heart of pharaoh i was reading them the other day you know where he hardened pharaoh's heart but he told moses he said i'm gonna harden his heart but now still pharaoh had a choice god didn't come down and say no you don't let them people go no he just put it before pharaoh knowing what pharaoh would choose you've got to remember one thing god cannot make you do something if you don't want to do it even though being god but you know what though remember he foresaw that foresaw what you would do and that you would come to a place maybe that you said i don't care anything about this i'm going in this direction and nothing's going to bother me well it's like that's like you know we were talking about the chart they then there was no representation oh they had representation all right but it was not representation from the eternal it was representation just in life because well look when we drop down and come down to the to the uh lifetime and matter or light timing matter we're gonna see that all that comes down but then all of a sudden you see nimrod and all these different other players come into being that were not in the eternal mind of god but he knew what they were going to do knew where they were going to be knew what they were going to do and then he could work his plan this to me that's just the most perfect way to do it but according he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love that's what i asked somebody one time before i said look it says it's already now look it's predetermined that we're going to be holy and without blame now as you and i are sitting here today we are not we are by the new birth but not by our old birth so he's already predetermined by foreign knowledge who's going to keep going on and who's not because those who is justified he's already glorified by what not by foreign knowledge i mean not by predestination but by four knowledge so see you determine as brother tom paul bush always said you trigger your predestination in other words you have everything in the world to do with it it's not putting in a tube well this is just the way i am it is what it is oh who says that anyway that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us until the adoption so he has predestinated us to come to a position by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now remember you say well now he's he's always sure he's going to have a perfect well but remember we're working in permissive will right now but he takes permissive will and works it right back to his perfect will but now remember the bible also tells us that god's willing everybody would be saved but not everybody's going to be saved because of the choice of foreknowledge he can tell who will and who won't to me that's just so very simple to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us what accepted in the beloved now see that's that's why brother brown said he really liked this scripture because what he'd done is taking us to a higher plane only in the book of ephesus could he do this only to the ephesians could he talk this way because they were a little more learned that we could all he could already tell them that we have already been accepted into beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us and all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will now remember paul got a part of it but he didn't get all of it remember the book was still closed the seals had not been opened he was working under a closed book he could take you i believe paul could take you just as close as as anything to that but he was not able to open the seals because that was predestinated to happen in the end time because you and i needed a body change paul did not need a body change you and i need a body change because there's no eighth church age there's no there's nothing we can throw this to you and i oh this is it we're either going to make it or not but we're going to because he saw somebody would make it that was a mouthful that in the dispensation of the fullness of times what right now this is the fullness of time i want you to understand that this is where god wants to work you say all this circumstances forget about circumstances remember we talked about the kuckelberg you're going to be sticky in this right here you're going to be sticky in your memories and conscious effects and imagination because that is what's killing us today is our memory our reasoning our conscience our affection and our imagination but now way down on the inside though when that cuckoo burr was changed into a wheat germ when that wheat life was put inside that kuckleberg we're supposed to bring forth wheat look like kookaburra all our life think about that 90 year old woman that brother brown saw when they went across the curtain of time we'll talk about that in the sixth dimension he went over there and that angel said hey you remember her well no he didn't remember because she was 90 years old when she came to the lord well she was a huckleberry for 90 something years but you know what she accepted christ and became a wheat and he saw that wheat in that sixth dimension he didn't see the woman he didn't see the woman he saw in that in this dimension he didn't see the woman that was birthed by her mama and daddy a long time ago he saw the new creature the new creation the new part of her that what when the cuckoo bird broke loose guess what happened there was wheat amen same way with you and i so let's don't worry about being the old huckleberry that's why paul says let's go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of all these different things let's go on to perfection our problem is we're like the frog we keep looking back what gets me is you look at the world and it's a little bit funny but mom can tell you you open up the paper and you look at these people that have passed on and you look and you say man that girl she was young well she was 88 when she died but that picture was her high school picture why do they do that let's look him back everybody wants to look back to what they were forget that business we supposed to look forward go on we got to worry about today stop back looking back that way it really tickles you know you look at him you go what that girl died really young she was 88 when she passed away but it's her high school picture so but why why do that to me that's false that's just the whole world is they were talking about today at work and about putting on makeup and how it was so hard and how it was they had to get up 30 minutes early and oh i'd be a wreck and i'd try to put it on going down that to me that's a lot of trouble i'm glad y'all don't have to do that i'd hate to see some of these women without the makeup on uh-uh brother brown said look like i ain't not a saint but see be natural be yourself i don't know where that came from but let's do that because we're getting ready to get out of here and everything every piece has got to fit together he might together gather that's what i was talking about in leviticus read leviticus and just read the whole leviticus one through about 20-something it's it's just everything is so perfect everything's got to be overlaid with gold and this has got to go first and that's going to go this and this got to go that and this goes this way but see that's the same way but that's a precursor to the word of god coming through jesus christ telling us be therefore perfect you don't have to do that anymore but you've got to do the things you're supposed to do written in the bible look at him a four-hour example that into this dispensation the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ and i'm going to read a quote here in a little while that i have not read before and brother brown says tells us that all things are now where in the bride we gathered everything in christ and now we know we're in christ but christ is not on the earth jesus christ the flesh man is not on the earth so where's his body his body as me and you so we now have it's been transferred to us that you are what you might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which on earth even in him and whom also we have obtained an inheritance see you got to obtain something you didn't come here with it you you came here with representation but you didn't come here with nothing special to me that's so simple how in the world can can i walk up on the white throne judgment and say well he put it in me when i was born and i didn't have i have nothing to do and and then i'm eternal i'm going to heaven and then the poor guy that that struggled and never you know god may have came to him and he turned him down but still he's going to look at me and go what'd you do that for him for why didn't you do that for me if it was so easy for him why is it why can't it be so easy for me no no no the only reason that you and i are going to stand not in judgment but at judgment is that we have took on christ gathered together one all things in christ christ was judged for me and you and we don't have to be judged anymore i'll read you a quote in a few minutes where brother brown said we were in the loins of jesus at calvary went to hell with him rose with him ascended with him came back on the day of pentecost with him if you're a gene seed of god that's exactly what i have that's your journey in him also we obtained obtained an inheritance fight every day for it don't we we fight every day being predestinated according to the what purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will amen i like that revelation 13 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world knowing that god wrote us down in a book took a picture of us when we were 16 18 20 years old somewhere and put us in an album and we were waiting to where we're going to read there where we talked about in psalms where in continuance we came we had to come when god in genesis i'm telling you that's how important that genesis if god had never spoke genesis 1 26 you and i would never be here the bride will not be on ever been on the earth but he spoke it and it had to come to pass we were in the gene loins of god when he spoke it it's just so much is done right right but we were written in the book of the life of lamb slain from the foundation of the world all right number two christ the mystery god revealed now god's secret myth that you had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and going to achieve and look he had a motive in doing it what was the motive in order to let him be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon a star adam a molecule he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him so in his great mind everybody understand when i put that chart that one spot that that mind of god is where everything's got to start where does everything start with you right here you're good and you're bad starts right here right here then you either let it go out here or you keep it to yourself so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed but now remember the thoughts of god are eternal the eternal part because remember he thought of adolf hitler but adolf hitler's not an eternal person but now remember he's in the plan every every player everybody you meet the people you don't even meet like i said before there's going to be people given eternal life by what you've done that you'll never know until you get to the white throne judgment and god says he changed your tyre he did this or he opened the door for you i'm going to give him eternal life because of you but you know what let god handle that that's for god to handle that's something that you know it's like daddy said you take that and you put it over here you don't have to deal with it don't worry about it you know don't don't don't walk in a restaurant somebody open the door for you go well you just got eternal life you know don't worry about that just do your daily duty keep going let god handle all that because you know what he already knows that before the foundation of the world all right and in him was love and he was to be father and he was to be son and he was to be a savior and him was to be a healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god and listen go back scroll back down how could he be a father you've got to have children how could he be a savior there had to be a people that needed saved how could he be a healer there had to be somebody sick so that he can display that attribute of healer so you and i had to come to express our father and his attributes and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god because see brother brown saw him as a healer he saw him as a savior he called him pup of god so that and he saw all the attributes probably i think more than any prophet he saw all the attributes of god coming together because he went back in the back part of god's mind you know you can say paul could have said he went back in the back part of god's mind but he didn't go in the part that brother branham went because we've got the open book we've got where now that the seals are open and we can see the full plan of redemption now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living now remember it unfolded to a prophet but remember the prophet went off the scene in 1965 but that didn't do away with it he saw all the way to the woman at the white house he saw all the way to to see we think well no it no he was standing prophesying that me and you would be here what would happen when we're here and even happen what's going to happen when we leave according to the bible but he saw it in a vision because there's nowhere in the bible that says the united states was laying in ruins or there would be a woman in the white house right but through the vision that connected with all the scriptures in the bible how that a woman would rule and be in revelation 13 would be the america would be a woman's nation but that had to come from the mind of god through the love letter because it wasn't written on paper but you and i got that love letter all cherish it so much the hidden mystery of god he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you will understand clearly then you see on i believe what is being done now we know that the next what we come down to now is we're we're coming down where god said let us make man in our own image and there's one word i keep forgetting right here he god said so it's a spoken word we're spoken word children he spoke and something came into being he spoke and the world came into being he made the beast and all the other different things and god said let us make man our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and to fowl the air and over the cattle of all the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image the image of god created in him male and female created he them god blessed them before they even gotten flesh god blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and fowl the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth what a wonderful thing that god did but then he took that genesis 1 26 man and he put him into flesh right everybody got that and then brother branham we're going to talk about a little bit later brother brown said he put man in five senses to contact the earth see taste feel smelling here everybody got that we've heard it forever and that's what you live look that's what you live by but remember we're given a sixth sense which is faith to look into another dimension that not to believe everything we see not to believe everything we hear unless we check it by that sixth sense right amen we just don't take the five senses because you can you can you take all five of them you can deceive all five of those senses every all five of them you can deceive them and make them see things have you ever looked at those things go to youtube and look up things where you know they give you a bunch of dots and you see like the number nine and five and four and your depth perception you're just looking at dots but once you keep looking see it's always there but your eyes were playing tricks on you and all the different things about um the the different sizes of the uh of the length of things well that's what i mean that's what satan then went to eve and he got her to see to eastfield smelling here all right but it was contrary to the word of god but now you and i are being changed back to the image to where yeah we see but what do we see we see by faith i want to see you you're not going to see jesus tonight standing here in human flesh but jesus is now standing here today and sitting here today in human flesh all right so how far is that from where adam was in the garden and we'll get to talk about when we talk about dimensions i believe adam could just go i mean this world is a big world it was as big then as it is now there just wasn't as many people on it but adam controlled the whole world so he could just go through any i believe he could just travel anywhere he wanted to through the dimensions because brother branham said it was like the holy ghost brooded over the earth and watched after the earth now the holy ghost doesn't need that wall it just goes right through it the day you received the baptism of the holy ghost didn't have to be a physical door open didn't have to cut you in stick it in though it went through another dimension a faster dimension and that faster dimension is what we're heading to now because that sixth dimension folks is right there it's just faster it's a faster dimension folks man has proved that fourth dimension is radio waves well you can put a tv set right here and you can pick up everything that goes through this building unlimited so don't you think god saw before the foundational world he was going to make me and you the same way where we cannot just receive what satan gives us but we can receive what god gives us and by the baptism of the holy ghost there's our spiritual rudder that turns us to and from listen things bombard you all day through the spiritual realm it bombards you and you don't even know it you don't know it i mean it's horrible to say but there's cursing and and everything going through this building right now i could just turn a cell phone on or sorry if there's any truck drivers here but don't ever go to channel 19 on on a cb radio but but it's going right through here now and you being a spiritual being you're picking it up you just don't know it cause it's going faster than you can hear it but if you got a receptor see now we have a receptor of the holy ghost which receives now it filters out all that other stuff we we're praying that it keeps all that away from us because you know this is the worst age because you know what even brother branham when he first started preaching there was not radio waves that much i mean there was a little bit come up in 1945 but now you look at all what's going on now with the cell phones you know you got 600 cable channels that you can watch and not all of them are good but they're running right through this they're they're filling up that fourth dimension remember the bible says hell hath enlarged its gates man had to enlarge the bandwidth bandwidth so now we go to hd and let's go to hd in the word of god because it's a faster faster dimension that we can work in how do you hear from god you don't hear from god in this dimension you hear from god in another dimension amen look at it look at us folks what god's done to us what he's equipped us with every day even when you put a cell phone up to your ear there's other there's other things going through that that you're not hearing because it's in another bandwidth but it's still bombarding your spirit realm kids be careful that's where satan is working right now he's working in that fourth dimension trying to trying to sway you to watch this watch that say this don't say that but you remember one thing your mom and daddy may not hear you but god sure does amen so now let's go through this but i don't think we've and i'm and i'm pr this is what i've been praying the first of the year lord that we tap in more of what you've got for us that we like i said before we may not know what three days from now holds or six months from now holds what knew something but that thing inside of you does that thing inside of you the reason brother branham could step over like he said step over and let god step in he had a prophetic gift amen and god could speak through him and show him things and show him visions but now tell me where that's just for him i thought he said we were to be prophetic people we were to be little messiahs so let's tap into that say lord show me show me what's going to happen show me what's going on show me give me supernatural direction not just the direction from this one in direction from the paper and the news and this and that and the other give me spiritual direction because that thing folks that thing inside of you knows all the way to the body change that's what it's in there for right right and you know what we do wrap it up and tie it up and put a muzzle on it we do i challenge you to open that thing up let's see what god can do for us amen the word was not made to be harnessed it was made to be released it was made to be open not shut amen so now we know let's talk about foreign knowledge for a minute and now we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are what they called according to his purpose many are called but few are chosen for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called so remember it looks to foreknowledge first we've been through this before but those who he called he justified and whom he justified not what you justified is what what some preacher justifies it's what god justifies then he also shall glorify it what shall we say to these things say it with me if god be for us who can be against us amen so by foreknowledge he knew by foreknowledge he knew whether you would or wouldn't watch this right here the word predestinate that's not a good word to use i'm going to let a prophet do that for us i wouldn't be strong enough to do that but he said predestination or predestinate is not a good word to use the word foreknowledge is better because predestination looks back to foreign so what was first if here's if here's predestination and here's for knowledge what's first for knowledge amen he foreknew therefore he could predestinate everything to go on and even predestinate all the way to the future home because there's john in revelations 19 or 20 wherever it was where he saw the city coming down what was it that look what it looked like a bride adorned for a husband all the way the very end of the plan they're still the bride the mind of god being unfolded listen the mind of god's not all been unfolded yet until we get to the future home and then after the future home it's going to be unfolding more we're just getting enough to get us out of here and what a wonderful amount we have if you'll just let god work predestination looks back before knowledge and foreknowledge looks to destination but god not making look set in order a little hole that you have to go through and you can't go no other way that's not what he did but god in order to be god he knowed the end from the beginning so he could predict it and set things in order to happen amen i like that you know why there's no mess up in god there's no foul up in god there's no oops moment like we have so i have to put my dependency then that's what i put my dependency on that he's right and he knows what he's talking about i just got to plug myself into that hey man i think about that the other day this is the perfect example you know and you're getting born again you know you can be you can be a um an air conditioner that makes things cold to minus 50 below and you can have the right plug but does it make its own power no you didn't come here with no power but when you take but you know then being the air conditioner that needs the power to work if you know where the power is at if you know where the power source is then what do you do you go over there and you say god i know what i need and when you do that guess what the electricity always was there you weren't you were the air conditioner you were the kokober but if you know where the electricity it's always there it's there all the time unless you physically cut it off there's power running into these circuits until unless you hit the big breaker there's power all enough power there brother danny to make this place as cold as alaska but unless you reach over there and plug it in see that's what you got to do people you have a choice to plug that thing in or just sit here and go i know where the power's at i know i'm just something but i ain't got enough no go and plug the thing in there's your power source there's your eternal life this is not eternal that's eternal but once you plug it in where does it go right inside the air conditioner it makes it run so plug it in amen but if we'd only go back to find out why god made his first man he made him in his own image and god is a spirit so he had to make a spirit man now the word is used here in the fifth verse of predestination predestinate is not a very good word for an evangelist or a minister to use because it kind of confuses the people when you say predestinate and it does because i think it's calvinism is it calvinism it's like i mean it's predetermined i mean it's like you're not going to do anything different than that right there see that's not true on that side then you go to armenianism just whatever but see what brother brown do he pulled them both together right he pulled them again just like he took the two limbs off of the trees and put them together for father son holy ghost and and the oneness or the trinity and oneness pulled them together what that's what the loose ends were that the prophet had to bring the loose ends together tie the cord back plug the electrical cord in and say this is it so predestination speaks looks back to foreknowledge for knowledge looks to destination predestination goes back to foreknowledge foreknowledge goes to destination in other words god didn't say now i'll make this man be this and i'll make this man be that but in order to be god he knew the end from the beginning in other words he knew what that guy was going to do and what this guy was going to do he could say this would happen and that would happen because he was god and knowed where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages you believe that you believe that you were ordained to be in this age right here by foreign knowledge adoption 1960. don't forget that election looks back here here it is i was a kookaburra i was born in sin shaped an iniquity come to the world speaking lies born amongst sinners fathers and mother father and mother and all my whole family centers i was a cuckoo bird but all of a sudden i became a wheat grain how did it happen that what is that election god before the foundation of the world elected that the cuckoo world kocobur was to become a grain of wheat now remember election you got to go look back to foreign knowledge though take it all the way back to foreign knowledge he that you would want it and you elected on your side god voted for you satan voted against you you swing the vote elected that the cucker wer kuckelberg was to become a grain of wheat now i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm saved how did i do do i do it look back and see that he predestinated it a long time ago that's not a problem for you to look back to that i'm talking about looking back on you what's down here but you can look back and see that god before the foundation of the world that's where you were we're going to get to in just a second i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm saved how do i do it you know i was thinking the other day brother branham is preaching to presbyterians i don't know what exactly they believed but baptist believed once saved always saved um you got one doctrine of of of denomination that well if you're doing good at the moment you die you're okay but if you don't you're not and see even catholics the same way you know you do your penance and you get put in purgatory and all that stuff but see i believe that's why god said no before the foundation world he said if you got eternal life tonight he was telling those people don't worry if you know you got it look back and see that you were in the mind of god and that you are now a wheat grain and can't be listen god's not an indian giver he can't take a huckleberry and make a wheat germ out of you and then turn around and say no you're not good enough i'm going to make you back a cuckoo bear no way god cannot do that so if you're a wheat germ tonight you always was a wheat germ in the mind of god look back and see that he predestinated a long time ago by foreign knowledge he seen that i would love him see he seen that i would love him so he made a perpetuation through his own son that through him i might become from a cuckolder to a grain of wheat now where i'm at now i'm saved i'm walking in the grace of god what does predestination look to destiny where will he take me to where am i going that's got you there you are i like that that's got you there you are all right number six 1964 questions and answers how can i take a cuckoo bar and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it it's impossible for you to save yourself no way jose you can't save yourself so accept that accept that it's impossible for you to get good enough and be good enough to be saved the only way it can be is because inside that kookaburra has been transmitted from a cuckoo bird wheat a cucumber to a germ called wheat life then you bury that kookaburra and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right because there has been a life of wheat put in the kuckelberg and the life of the cuckoo bar has been taken out but the nature of the cuckoo bird is still sticky in other words you still got this thing you still got your memories and conscious effects and imagination and it will be until this new life has fully been developed thank god the bible says old things are passed away behold all things have become new you won't remember the bad things you won't remember the hardships that you went through and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again in other words in the resurrection or in the body change when it comes forth then it's no more cuckover but wheat but wheat but while it's here on the earth and out of the earth the cuckerberg is still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside it of wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin has gone from your sea that's the thing number seven the seed shall possess against the enemy that's what you are we are now a wheat germ a grain of wheat in god's garner when we was a cuckleber and god changed us from a cuckleberry to a grain of wheat it makes the fruits different changing your own mind your own ideas it's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a man or a woman is born again of the spirit of god and becomes a new creature in christ jesus the greatest miracle that you're still in that shell that came from mom and daddy you still got that old adamic nature you still lean back to the old carnal mind but inside of you is almighty god and he's never going to take it back out you look at that example brother adam gave of that preacher and listen you can be influenced by spirits even it took a prophet of god to tell us that even if you commit suicide you still can be born again because see there's a lot of people a lot of denominations if you commit suicide you you're hell that you you never were a christian and some of them are pretty prominent baptist for one but thank god for a prophet that said you can get influenced by spirit and commit suicide and still be a christian right amen that's hard that's hard to that's hard to fathom but i can see how it happens because see memories and conscious effects and imagination that's still in satan's realm i mean god works in there too but you can yield yourself to the devil look at that preacher that said i ain't preaching no more i'm done i'm finished with it i'm going to get me some beer and i'm going to get drunk right brother ramsey okay he lived for six months brother brown said god took his child home so he wouldn't marry his name what he was a born-again child of god yet he let something influence him so much until he started doing things but i promise you you won't do them long if you're a child of god he won't mar he won't let you but see he didn't take it away from brother ramsey either he didn't put it in there and said nope you're the koco bear the whole time no though he had the wheat germ planted but he just allowed other things to get in his way thank god that we had a prophet that could tell us these things all right let's go to representation we know that we were talking the other sunday about the little woman at the well remember now she was standing there in front of jesus and she was a prostitute she was a she had all kind of husband she was living with a man now she must have had some men problems somewhere down the road but remember somewhere though she heard the word of god and that word is the seed nothing else and what was happening was god was standing in front of her jesus christ that was the word that was the seed that she was waiting on because she's still standing over here she said we know when messiah comes he'll do these things and he said i am he well that didn't do nothing but just spark exactly she said oh this is what we've been waiting on and she run back into the into the city and said come see a man she had representation the prophet said the representation of foreknowledge knowing he was going to meet that woman knowing what she was she could have just done like the pharisees and said you just guessed that buddy i'll see you later there's no telling how many people that jesus met that done that right he's just a good guy because you read the bible if you read the comments of the bible oh he was a good man that was joseph's boy that wasn't joseph's boy am that wasn't joseph's child but that's all that's joseph's boy that's the carpenter's son he's a wine bibber he he hangs around centers and hmm how about that but they didn't have predestination from predestination and what comes before predestination for knowledge this is one he foreknew that would come look she was looking look she's got representation see and then she was looking for this to be made flesh doesn't matter what kind of condition she was in somewhere in her life she had heard mama daddy sister brother some preacher talk about when the messiah gets here she might have been living with five people she might have been doing all the bad things in the world but something inside of her amen i believe that there was something different because she got representation that she said roll it up she said sir i perceive that you're a prophet now when we know the messiah which is called christ will come and when he does he'll do this he said i am he and that sparked that seed that she had read somewhere in the old testament where the virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child and his name shall be emmanuel and he will come and he'll be come out from a tribe of judah and he'll come from this and he'll come from that all that went going through her mind but listen she would not have got eternal life if she was just a prostitute and didn't not do nothing but read good homes and garden you understand what i mean but god foreknew that he saw that he approached her thank god he approached her he was in human flesh no more doubt you didn't have to explain it she saw it she believed it the way she went what did it do to her it redeemed her now remember we said that before she didn't get eternal life right there right no way folks listen jesus hasn't died yet now let me give you a little thought she was inside of him her representation was inside of jesus christ because if we were in the loins of jesus christ and went to calvary and she became a born-again believer she was right there with him same man was mary mary his mother had to go to pentecost to receive the holy ghost but what she needed was inside the sun and shimmer you'd think if anybody had a what would you say a free pass to heaven would be the one that suckled him and kept him and nope no god has no respect to a person there's no telling how many virgins god came to and said will you do this and they'll say no but mary said be it unto me according to thy word your words will condemn you by your words you shall be justified and by your words you shall be condemned what does redeem mean bring back why didn't he get the priest he never was up there he had no representation he came to redeem that which had fallen in the fall this got messed up with that girl but god had her in his thinking there go back to the thinking before the foundation of the world and he came to cleanse her then he she had eternal life see where the priest what did it do to him sent him right back to his destination he had nothing to begin with only intellectual learning now listen friends the only thing you've got is just intellectual learning you get something different from that and you'll never be able to get it unless you've got representation see now there i can go with always was because god can't change his mind but he saw though what you would choose he saw though what the woman at the well would choose he saw that caiaphas would hate him hate him he said salvation is of the jew woman we know what you're not what you're talking about we know what sorry we know what we're talking about he said you worship you don't even know what but you're supposed to know the word see how it was supposed to be but see he was watching now why he got to what is he going to do now brother brown i'm in another quote he says he was catching her spirit right right he was catching her spirit y'all wake up grief is wednesday night he was watching now why he's going to what is he going to do prove his word why because he's fixing to discern right now he's he's seeing a vision he's discerning the thoughts of her heart by the way go get your husband and come here she said i don't have any husband he said you've told the truth lady see because you've had five and the one you now have is not your husband see what something happened something took life what was it that word that she had heard it sparked something she's like man this is the guy this is the one we've been looking for now if it hadn't been in there to begin with what that predestinated thought in the mind of god is what she tapped into she had no if she hadn't had representation from predestination which was before predestination from foreknowledge it never took hold god who is rich in mercy watch this one now if you've got eternal life tonight if if if if we have eternal life then we always were because there's only one form of eternal life we always were always were eternal in the mind of god and the reason we were because we are a part of god and god is the only thing that's eternal and like as melchizedek received times from abraham and it was allotted to his great-grandson levi who was yet in the loins of abraham paid tithe for he was yet in the loins of abraham god showing predestination showing foreign knowledge i want to speak on that over in the other place one morning who is this melchizedek now read the book who is mr kels who is this melchizedek now notice way back god knew this boy coming down he knowed all things now we are a part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in god listen you were you were literally inside of your daddy when he was a little boy literally in what in dna not as a person you don't become a person until you get a soul and you didn't get a soul inside your regular daddy come on people good grief but through what a betting ground allowed by god between a union of a man and a woman your body was produced and then god had to give you a soul right your mom and dad didn't give you a soul they got you here so god could give you one but you were in his thinking you were only an attribute in god you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were right i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare there is the fear and scare what is the fear and scare oh we may not make it oh well you might if you're if you're if you you know if you get caught having a bad thought and you die you go into hell no that's all fear that's fear fear fear you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of god you are son of god before the foundation of the world you were an attribute in the mind of god you were inside your literal daddy and even go back to your granddad and your great-great-granddaddy in in gene in genetic form not running around you couldn't find you but see god being god you couldn't find us in god only through the word but he was the word he was the word made flesh you don't know who you are you're going to be but now you are the sons of god see you always were the sons of god for when god had you in where in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there let's continue on let's go to the very bottom of that quote if you don't mind it seemed like there was something in you that cried out we've read this last sunday there was god somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that amen certainly how many times did you you friends go out and party and you don't go with them because of some something going on something something that just didn't feel right you might have just thought it as luck but folks i don't believe in luck because you have an angel if you're going to come to a spot where god's going to talk to you you're going to have to make it to that time but one day after a while you heard the gospel that was that little form of life in you then form the word we all were preached to hello we all were preached to even when we were little kids and where did it stick somewhere it's stuck up here where's the first womb i'm here right right and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked this out and that out went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of god you had to be part of the word so where did you where is your representation in the word amen and then you heard the word you knew where you came from you knowed what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always what that planting of the word was in you the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world is when it saw you not the day you got born again oh my goodness but you got to remember you had to come to that because remember i read you the quote where brother brown said your eternal life started the altar you had a time when you started your christian journey you wasn't always a christian hello i think we can all be obvious with that the word seeing the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it there's no way you can't invisible union number 11. let's go to the wait a minute i'm sorry go back up because i got to read this one thing i didn't read it the other day can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground now he's talking about us being like jesus christ am i okay with that that's what he's saying just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus in the bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and came out here and came to a head where in this age and all that life that come up through here picked up his people what luther wesley pentecost amen it was the same life now it's forming up into a head for the rapture speaking on that tomorrow night or next night one lord willing well you separated from your first union by spiritual death what you were born i'm going to read it here in just a few minutes you were born between satan and eve well you separated from your first union by spiritual death now you are born again are remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life for the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you amen now let's read this one that nobody likes in the whole message nobody likes to read this one well we do because see this this break sure this break sure uh always was that's the matter today you want some kind of phony makeup screaming jumping speaking in tongues or something instead of waiting for the real word of god to be made manifest through the bride them kind that takes the word is god's true bride bringing forth children they can't die a child the bride brings forth on the word cannot die because you now are the word did you get it she can't die because she that child can't die because she's a word child she's a seed child she's an eternal child hallelujah that's exactly what jesus was a spoken eternal child don't have to die but he did in order to pay the debt that's the only way it could be paid nobody else could do it they were all sexual born after the devil his plan you got it now but look watch this now but every man no matter whether he's pope priest bishop prophet whatever he is he dies because he's a hybrid that's exactly he was born between satan and eve right you toot your whistle all you want to you can toot it when you're born again but you can't toot it when you get born between them two people and you know what that's meaning the act between satan and eve is how you got here between your mom and daddy by permissive will right but you weren't supposed to be look he says and they call it whatever you want to it was satan and need the original word had nothing to do with it that genesis 1 26 man had nothing to do with that union between satan and eve or that union between your mom and your daddy but by permissive will to get you here it had to come that way to be a healer savior redeemer and all these other attributes the original word was life he had hybrid it and it brought death we good with that all right that's the hood of this melchizedek to me this explains the whole thing just read it slow when you get home you can read it again they bring it they have this online so you can read it and some of you have the have the notes now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body but a theophany this body is subject to the word and earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body so we're waiting for this kokomo right here to be changed into wheat but we had to have some kind of wheat to get started with we got to have a wheat germ inside to get started to make that wheat plant bring forth wheat life that's why you had to be reborn nicodemus you have to be born again born from above not between your mom and daddy but a theophany this body is subject to the word in earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you as son see he was at the beginning the word remember he was an eternal child he was eternal before there was an eternal hello jesus christ never anyway now the difference between him and you as son he was at the beginning of the word in morphy body now in other words you got to remember this watch listen to me jesus christ was the son of god we know that but remember he was not a son like me and your son he was not in an act he wasn't in the father running around as an attribute he was the attribute he was the father made manifested that's the difference in me and you that's why adam couldn't save eve he was not a savior that was not his attribute but god said i'll put enmity i'll come and save this thing i'll come and put it back because look now the difference between him and you as son see he was at the beginning of the word now see you potentially were but you can't be the word formed body in what i'm looking at right now you had to come born in sin born between satan and eve he was at the beginning of the word an immorphy body he came in and lived in that in the person of melchizedek then later we never see no more of melchizedek because he becomes jesus christ not two different people whatever the attribute that came to abraham it's the same attribute that died on the cross it's just the problem was melchizedek was the body spoken into existence as a full-grown man where jesus was born a baby like you are so he could be called your brother he could be what your kinsmen redeemer he couldn't just be a redeemer he had to be a kinsmen redeemer and redeem back that what was lost i thought brother bob i knew the plan of salvation i didn't know it as much as i knew it now and you should take every piece of that plan of salvation and see how god what he had to go through to get you here regardless of all the other stuff what the devil throwed out and he was god's right-hand man god let him deal with all these different things yet god had a plan to get you here and that was nothing nothing going to stop it you know why because if he thought it it's gotta come to pass and it can't change from there to here amen he just changed his mask same person same personality but he put on another mask and became melchizedek then that melchizedek couldn't come over here and be jesus christ the as a human mortal man born though come as a man he had to come as a baby because you had to come as a baby then later we never heard no more melchizedek because became he became jesus christ melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus christ now you bypass that remember you didn't come full grown with an eternal body or an eternal soul you didn't come that way you bypassed that remember you had to go around it you couldn't come straight from attribute right down into human flesh because you're lost we'll prove that next time we preach and we'll see that when the sin happened there was no way for man to get back here and there was no way listen to me there was no way for god to get to you oh well why didn't he give moses the new birth why didn't he give isaiah the new birth why didn't he give all these people in the old testament because he had to come himself and he was only he was the father he was jehovah god down through the old testament right here though right here blood of bulls and goats covering it was but when he come he come down through that he came down through all that junk and became human flesh so that he could take and take that blood of bulls and goats away and put his own blood the blood of a man not the blood of bulls and goats and the blood of a man that can multiply and replenish the earth by spoken word not by sex because you came like adam like me because remember adam had sex with eve adam had more children that you understand what i'm talking about like me you became from attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting remember it's not up in heaven you are who you are where's the attribute of god if you're born again it's not sitting up in heaven somewhere it's down inside of you but when this life is finished here if this earthly type and i can be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done and now we don't understand it we have never become the word in other words we've never become the total word of god told the word of god you've got to go back to genesis 1 26 now it's come down and come inside of you but you've still got the cuckerberg shell but then look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination which that's not a good word so that proves the foreknowledge of god i'm just quoting the prophet see you can't be the word unless your thought you had to be in the thinking first but see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass that eternal genesis 1 26 man you didn't come with that god held that but god came here on earth with that inside of him called jesus christ the very soul of almighty god was jesus christ and where were you in the attribute form you were in there i'm going to read your quote here in just a second if you'll just give me a few minutes you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me and i'll raise him up the last day see you had to be first and then you see he came right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is put on a lounge book of life and from that he becomes the word the theophany that could appear disappear then he became flesh and returned back again resurrected that same body and glorified conditions come by jesus christ but you bypassed the theophany and became flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the body see when those when those when those saints died and stepped into that sixth dimension they couldn't take that they couldn't bring that body with them right but there was a body being built inside of their human body a theophany the genesis 1 26 man was being nourished and then what when they stepped over into a faster dimension the body can't go it has to stay here in time life and matter matter means they can't get out of the grave because it's solid but you didn't have to open the door to let their soul go outside or go into that sixth dimension they just stepped into a faster dimension but look when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to god it throws this body into subjection by god number 13. look sons and daughters was in god at the beginning amen where were you job when the sons of god shouted for joy back before the eternal but we weren't people running around listen just think if you were all knowing it didn't matter how much time it took if you knew in your loins that by the spoken word of god you could create six million sons and daughters you'll be so happy because that's the eternal people that's gonna spend eternity with you that's what he was looking at that's what he was shouting for joy he saw you he saw us develop he saw the seventh church age he saw the junk that we had to go through and he said i'm pleased to dwell in those people sons and daughters within god at the beginning now look you've got eternal life you say you got eternal life you say we believe it that we got eternal life where there's only one form of eternal life and that's god that's the only thing that is turned eternal as god then if you've got eternal life if that life that's in you always was and you were in the loins of god before there was even a world what is the loins of god it's the word of god not down here it's the word of god remember we're born from up here from god you were in the loins of god before there ever was a world and when the word itself jesus himself is called the word and in saint john 1 in the beginning was the word where it was with god word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us then you were in the loins of jesus and went to calvary with him you died with him let me interject a little bit you went to hell with him you don't have to go to hell you already been there and you came out victorious you came out with the keys i'll clap myself you came out with the keys you died with him you raised with him and today we're sitting in heavenly places in him filled with his spirit sun and daughters of god die with him raised with him sure now then now now you can fellowship with him you couldn't fellowship in other words you couldn't fellowship back there because you were just a word in him a seed where in him listen your your natural mom and daddy didn't carry that seed you can carry the word uh-uh you carried natural seed because you had to come through satan and eve you had to come the natural way god had to rebirth you that's why it's called reborn that's why it's called a new birth you were reborn from where jesus said from above that's where it all started that's the mind of god but now he has manifested you and now he wants you to fellowship with him why'd he get you out far to fellowship with you then he came down was made flesh so he could perfectly fellowship with you see the perfect fellowship oh my them deep mysteries of god how wonderful see god could not fellowship in the spirit so god became man with us they tried to figure him out all during the old testament never could figure him out even when he came in human flesh they didn't understand him but boy when he came back into the people on the day of pentecost they started understanding he talks about i can't brag on my ancestors i come through an awful mess father was an irishman mother was an indian squad half indian her mother was an indian draw the pension all of them drunks most of them died with a shoe zone fighting gunfighters and so forth i can't brag on nothing about that because my ancestors and my family tree is terrible but brother there's one thing i can brag on i can brag on my lord jesus who has redeemed me and with his transforming power planted a seed by predestination and i saw it what he saw brother rem see it saw the word preached the word somebody preached the word he saw it got convicted got saved whose son am i now yeah i can brag on him and i've spent 33 years of my life bragging on him if he would spare me another 33 years i'll try to brag more on him can we say the same i can brag on my ancestor hallelujah he that redeemed me and planted the seed of life in here and let me look down upon the word sitting down his spirit and said here it is and you accept it and it says what speak this and it will happen do that oh my i can brag on him how did he do it through the washing of the water by the word the waters of separation one more quote will be done number 14 magicians get ready to come invisible union this one i listen to this if you're married to christ christ is the word of god now look if you're married to christ christ is the word of god in saint john the first chapter said in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the same was made flesh and dwelt among us christ was the living word he always was the word he is still the word he always will be the word he was only the manifestation of the attributes of god for he was the son of god not a son of god he was the son of god all the attributes were in him every one of them and look and any son is the attribute of his father just as you were in the genes of your father now naturally in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the bedding ground of a mother you were brought forth into the earth and became in the image of your father earthly then he could fellowship with you and so were you sons of god and daughters of god before there even was a moon star molecule you were sons and daughters of god for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in god at the beginning physical you had to come down here and get in flesh so that you can listen how do you worship god in spirit and truth right but where's that spirit it's inside your cuckoo bird you make that kuckerberg raise his hands you make that cuckleberg not look at a woman look over here you make that huckleberry do all these different things amen why because you're a son and daughter of god you heard from your theophany amen you heard from you heard the word of god you were sons and daughters of god for you are the um for you are only the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in god at the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before now look before not not when you were born a baby before the foundation of the world you don't know nothing about it neither do you know when you was in your earthly father but you are manifested too in his image in the image of god you are made and you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship of god and therefore this is going to sum the whole thing up right here and therefore as sure as your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual gene had to be where not in your daddy had to be in god because you're an expression of the attribute of his thoughts before the foundation of the world listen we as fathers loved it when we went into that waiting room and we knew there was a baby coming but when i was growing up you didn't know the sex of the child so it was either it was a big surprise then right now you can find out three days after so there's no secret to it but what about though look at phil the emotion men feel the emotion women you feel the emotion of knowing that there's something coming there's a life coming don't you think on the day you got born again that your daddy was standing right there and he was saying i'm fixing to see one of my kids i'm finally after 2000 after 6 000 years when i spoke genesis 1 26 i'm now seeing one of my children being born well if a human man could be happy and a human woman could be happy what about a god that knew when it was going to happen yet he was still happy the day that you got born again oh what much you can't do nothing else but worship him and serve him your spiritual gene had to be in god because you're an expression of the attribute of his thought you were a spoken word child right no way around it that's right now now we notice then that life being in you god's life being in you from the foundation of the world but something had to happen let's go to the next the scripture we've been reading let's read it one more time psalm 139 my substance was not hid from me when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth you know job looked one day and he said oh that i my name would be written in a book or that i could see what was going to happen thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect for all those years that we walked in sin and all the different things but yet daddy was standing there that day ready for a child to be born knowing you would come to a place knowing you would come to a place knowing you all would come to a place and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance in other words one right after the other we're fashioned one is yet there was none of them he had to wait what a patient god but when he waited he wasn't listen god's never gonna god's never gonna ask you why did it take you so long to get born again he knew exactly how long it would take but he was so patient that he would patiently wait on everyone in continuance knowing we were born in sin knowing what we would do listen that's the same way as the children of israel i mean you can see justification and sanctification baptism holy ghost right there through the children of israel children of israel what chosen of god amen he knew though 40 years later there's only two of them going to go in yet he babied them right through justification what stood at the water put that stick down two million people walked across on dry ground and he looked and what did he say he turned around and he said those egyptians you see today those sins that you see today you'll see them no more justification and then sanctification is kind of it's kind of interesting how they went through the wilderness of what sin but you watching what they were doing though god was getting them ready knowing only two was going to make it plus the little ones now i'm talking about but the original group he knew what they would do yet he would continually tell him when you get in the promised land now see that's you in sanctification because he knows who's going to make it and who's not so he's going to take you through this journey and he's going to you're going to cry for water one day and you're going to cry for this one day and you're going to cry for this one day you're going to loathe that bread this my goodness i'd love to have it it tastes like it tastes like honey come down all you had to do is go pick it up no money involved but yet god just didn't he said i know they all gonna die he said but i'm gonna baby him right through sanctification and that's what the unclean spirit goes out what was he doing he was driving out all them unclean people that wasn't gonna make it to the promised land but then they walked up to the promised land and what did what did uh caleb and joshua and caleb caleb stood there and he said give me my mountain he said i'm more able now than i was 40 years ago and jay and joshua and caleb took all the young ones and they went into the promised land atop of the baptism of holy ghost but remember what happened as soon as they got there they had to fight their way for every piece of ground every devil was still over there in the promised land oh brother wade yeah the devil's still here let's stand to our feet but if you can't see that in the children of israel man god just through the whole wilderness of sin you know because remember in sanctification you're not born again you have sin you go through all these different things but god is what he's he's driving out the unclean spirit he was driving out all that stuff he said don't go after other gods don't marry other people stay away from the hittites and the highways stay away from all these websites and all these other different all these other ites that's your sanctification that's your journey but he knows who's going to make it who doesn't you got to choose whether it's you or not right let's sing us all god bless you let's worship him just for a minute 403. sorry 403. i've been to the water and i've been baptized i've been washed in the blood of the land i've been changed from the creature that i once was and redeemed is now my name i've been changed i've been reborn all my life has been rearranged what a difference it makes when the lord has his way all my life praise god has been changed though my sins were scarlet they're as white as snow i was bound but today i am free i was lost in the darkness but now i've found i was blind but i see i've been changed i've been reborn praise god has been changed when at last in his presence i stand above he will wipe every tear from my eyes and i'll thank him for giving a rash like me a new home he's given to you right have you thought about that think about your the lord life his ways life praise god has been saying it again is your dismissal
