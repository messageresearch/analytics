TRANSCRIPT
========================================
seeing open the eyes of our heart that's so important in this time to have a revelation of what God is doing in their midst and his plan for us and we know that by the revelation of his word to us and through the opening of the word amen open the eyes of my heart Lord les Austin open the eyes of my heart for I want to see you oh Jesus I want to see so open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes I want to see you oh I want to see to see you hi and lift it up oh you're shining in the light of your glory so pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy so high and lifted up oh you're shining in the light of your glory amen so pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy name Oh holy holy holy you are holy holy holy holy holy and I want to see amen and amen and amen and I want to see him don't you they just hear about it in the house of the Lord good to see everybody outside the house of the Lord out there in the cars and the things and just we pray that the Lord would put it to where you can hear real good and everything can be done and then we can really I guess we don't have to worry about this from now and we can tell you you can come outside and park and bring your laptop with you and everything cause it'll go right through the internet system you know you know so if you want to do that but we just have to keep her our you know group of people coming to keep everything running right and all and that's why we do that way you know to get it all to go in and make abide by the the rulings and things but the main thing is just to pray that God would reach down and touch these just the whole world cause never has there been a time that the world was in a turmoil like it is now you know never before it's all that's never been and it's just you know you don't know what's gonna happen from day to day so don't we don't worry about it we just we just going and and take it as we we receive it and be ready against today and then if you like turning your scriptures turned with us to the Book of Luke 24 and we'll read a little bit there just remember to pray for I know you have but for the Addison family her brother dick passing away this morning somewhere around 7:00 7:30 or something this morning and it's a good day to pass in other words if I have to pick a day of the year for her to be my passing away I would definitely either want it to be in or the the events of Calvary and all the connections so but just pray for them they'll let us know whatever and we don't know what they can do no way to know until you get all to doing and they'll let us know because their plans were to cremate the body to take it down to port st. Joe there and you know put his ashes where he always loved to go you know so remember that and then there'll be a memorial somewhere down the road and the church will have one or something if they don't into the basis of that will have a memorial for him because we don't can't have this is the oddest thing that's ever happened in the world when you can't bury people in it and then where they can in places they're just ditching outstrips and just putting the caskets and things in you know and oh there's too many people dying but remember that also remember brother al now his mother passed away there I believe it was yesterday so remember her the family they're the ones that's left you know Al and his brother and just fret the Lord would bless each one the Lord would wave will be ministering winds me so remember that in Petra Lord we've got each one of us alright we're going to Luke 24 we'll go to verse 1 father we thank you for your grace and your love and your understanding thank you for everything thank you for loving us lord thank you for a resurrection time what a day what a time that we have to realize that we are beneficiaries or the resurrection not it was just a day or a time or for somebody else but it's for us and we have the rights of all of the things that goes with the resurrection and the whole entire plan of redemption is based in that because you proved our in the resurrection who you was and what you were doing and everything to be made manifest was proved by your resurrection because no man could raise from the dead unless it be you we love you and we thank you and just have your way bless the Addison family and Resta the Kennard family at all and just be with each one have your way member and others or their sick among us never brother Dale learned us be with humans sister Mary just bless brother Kali Lord and be out with all of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen naturally we would read the resurrection time it's a good time and we'd read the scriptures of it but it may change a little bit as we go along into the message but let's go to verse 1 Luke 24 now pon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the supper to bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the separator they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed their hate their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead alright now think of that ycq the living among the dead that's one they went there to see they went to her to see a dead man come find out ain't no dead man there don't fight that ain't no man there cuz he's raised all right what is it they ycq the living among the dead he is not here but his risen remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee you may be seated the Lord that his blessings will pick up another scripture connected right to that one in a moment but you know it's a great time to have a Easter services and things we're proud to be able to do that and for the people to be outside with us some things at least they're that close you know under pray that as I said that all of this applies on off and that everything will get back to normal or we can be in services and all because we miss each other I was kidding it some of them out there want to go was I seen them coming by I said where you been you know they said what were you being so he's all do it it was but anyhow it's a good time to be in the life day alright now we know that in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ as I said no man had been able to raise you know nobody could do now he could raise God could raise the dead or something like that but nobody could raise this themselves on the basis of their word and that was really what it was he had talked throughout the to his journey of time there with them through the Gospels and talked about the things that would happen and what would take place and and all like that and he was beginning to tell them you know what to expect okay you go to mark and there's about eight thirty one and it says and he began to teach that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and the chief priests and scribes now he that was his teaching coming down and be killed and after three days rise again alright so he spoke of his resurrection okay the Prophet says then in that that that day proved the point of who he was the day that he raised proved who he was that he was Almighty God in human flesh and what nobody else could do that and bring forth but yet he he was speaking and telling them and showing them all the way through the gospel showing them what would happen and it was like to them I guess as it says one time in there was like idle words on going on in Luke a little you know it was like idle words to a lot of people even after they had seen the grave opened even after they had seen it was gone they still could not comprehend or put everything based upon that when they'd had three and a half years of talking about it telling them about it and the best you could come out of it was Peter sitting now now they're not gonna kill you we'll fight then I mean that would be the best you could get out of the whole twelve of them was a fact of one saying or will this fight well that wouldn't no good that wouldn't want nothing about it but I want you to think about now in the resurrection because that resurrection was the said proof dar that who he was okay now now put that to work that you get to where it says that he has risen we know this we've been through it for all of our years talking about the resurrection and the time that it doesn't say he has or was or whatever it puts it into a personal present tense form of saying he is risen all right now see that message has always been the same the reason I'll bring it like that see you'd say come over you know a few years later and said well we know well we know yo we believe he was here and he was raised from the dead and and things like that we believe that but that wouldn't be the gospel that was being brought that gospel that was being brought when it was a saying he is risen it would be from that day until the final resurrection alright now I've said that forgotten well meaning the final resurrection call see there has to be a resurrection there has to be a resurrection in the last days all right and it will finalize in the total resurrection of those that are asleep in Jesus Christ and see then ever generation had the same message well not just looking back or looking forward ever generation had the same message he is risen alright so if anybody ever asked you about the Lord Jesus just tell him say he is risen because you know one no no he did raise back yonder we believe that no no that's not what he said he is risen they they made two proclamations the Angels did in declaring to show that what we should always be saying he is risen and keep that to us to her that we can see that you know in the day that we're living all right now see during this Easter morning as we would call it then he raised from the dead came forth but that wasn't all of it yeah they said we can believe that president can't sometimes that's not all of it it didn't end just by his resurrection what kind of a gospel would we have if we had no connection to the resurrection right well what kind of a gospel would you have welcome what would you be even be thinking about it unless you could say he is risen but now the only way you can say he is risen is for that resurrection to be inside of you speaking out so what is the the the resurrection what is the connection the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the resurrection right because that's the proof of it when we received the baptism in the Holy Ghost that's proof for the resurrection when he raised was proof of who was when he raised it was proof that he was Almighty God and that everything was in control and that he would tell that to every church age as it would go all the way through until it would come finally a total physical resurrection one day what you see we don't have to wait until that day comes we don't have to say well one of these days there'll be a resurrection no the Prophet is and brother Joe was quoted this morning there he said what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is something right now present tense we don't have to wait on the resurrection the resurrection started the day he was born again the day you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that started your resurrection it also started your rapture because without that being in us there will be no resurrection no rapture for us yes you know you have to have something take place well no I depend upon what took place back there but I want that brought up here and what have I been preaching for months and months what not back not forward look at it now so let's look at the resurrection right now then let's get the resurrection into the right place where it is then then we can say to ebuy said he is risen we don't have to say he has risen that anybody could say it that way proclaim it but to those who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that new birth within side of you there is the resurrection the rapture and all that we have need of what your prophet said this is everything you have need of than that Holy Ghost when you receive it all we need is to grow develop mature we need a stature of a perfect man we need no sign but you realize that if you started off at faith and ever went any further then you couldn't declare he is risen you would be declaring he has you'd be looking back now you're looking forward to the headstone one day capping everything off and that headstone will be a message come on if it was a message back there that's where everybody's trying to make it some kind of a big thing the message back there he is risen every age has had that same message well what would be the headstone would it not be the same message just a deeper depth and understanding and an opening up of more the word or our bringing in to view and seeing it more clear but what it still not be here is risen these in that way you don't have to worry about what the seals are what this is that it's the message he is risen that's the message that's still here after 2,000 years we still have the same message but if we don't believe it like that now if we believe he was or will be that's not the what the angel said yeah that wasn't the message that was told to them it was told that he is risen because he had declared all the way through his teachings in the gospel and like I said during mark then he taught his doctor and he taught his life and when it finished with the book of Mark what a defense was saying and that he would raise again the third day well we know that's what happened we know he raised the third day huh that's that's fulfillments of the scripture but why would it say that he would rise again the third day that's what Mark said he said he he'd rise again sounding like maybe there's something about this resurrection that did not completely finish up back there and that's what I'm trying to get me and you look at see if we can keep it he is risen it'll come from all the way back there all the way to where we're at and then we have the message and we have the prophets message to declare He is risen because that was his message that he is risen that was that was what went across you know the the world in seven or seven times around the world now preaching what He is risen because he was preaching something that was present tense something that was alive right then and see that baptism of the Holy Ghost being the new birth it is the resurrection inside of you right come on Anais it's it's it's a proof he proved who he was when he raised right he proved who he was when he raised uh-huh see if we have the resurrection then like he did then there's a proof that holy ghost that you have is a proof that he is risen you're not taking what somebody else says see if you say what somebody else says you're just repeating that you're not saying what the word says the word said he is risen right now he is risen he is as always present tense me and that's the way that there's never been nothing else but president all the whole Bible is present tense I am ever present for eternity what about it a simple message a simple thing of thinking about the resurrection but thinking about that it started back there but it will not end until the finality of the resurrection one day they will be a literal resurrection for those that are pi stone but to show you the message is right that he s prayer is as present tense somebody don't have to die teach of some people is not going to be a physical resurrection oh never thought about it like that listen a little bit see some people will never have to have a resurrection why because the resurrection is inside of them it's already there it's not something to you how to see those that are alive and remain they'll be caught up they don't have to raise in the resurrection cuz they don't die why because the new birth started that so positive back there until that soul cannot die and that's why I said it in your resurrection started even if you die if you die your resurrection started back there and one day will climax in a physical resurrection because some people will die and have to be raised the dead in Christ will rise first okay then when that comes forward see then the point of the eternal life dwelling within you and me can declare the whole thing is finished that's that's that's what I'm trying to get you to see that's when that brother asked me what my my point was or what I was aiming at I'm aiming at a positive total present tense eternity right now the day you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the rapture set in in your heart and soul sure physically we need a lot of things we need to growth developments we need all of the things yes we need the adoptions we need the Statue of perfect man we need to teaching of the word we need to seal the opening to it we need all of those things yes but it started back that without the baptism with the Holy Ghost it wouldn't make no you know nothing else wouldn't be worth anything but see we have it already set within us and we have proof right now we are proof that heroes back there we are proof that he raised well you know one of them people you know everybody talks about it he raised but let me ask you a question with him putting it into the resurrection why are they looking for the Lord to come why are you looking for the Lord to come well he said he's coming ninety said he's here he's resident he's here oh yeah we know we have to but I'm if you're getting the point and listen what I'm saying you saved it up the people are preaching around the world today because you know and I'm not making remarks or anything but because of the situation worldwide and way things are going there was probably as money since they can on the churches were full today preachers on the radio preachers doing as we're doing broadcasting the message out doing all of those things yes and probably a whole lot more than they was like sister a lot more talking about to the things that we need sincerely to be you know right now we need to get serious we need to get desperate because look at what all these things is taking place well that's good that's what I'm saying but is that all that it is is the fact that you're afraid are you afraid of dying if you're afraid of dying you don't have the Living one within you but if you if you don't have the Living one in here you help automatically be afraid of dying now there's a part like somebody said the other day about it you there's a part about death that we don't understand yeah there's a fear situation in there brother Louise talking about Wednesday there's a situation within that fear that yes we don't understand the death and the burial the resurrection the way we need to and we won't forget it fully until it's finished then it'll be done then we'll understand well yet there's no need of being there's not any theater to that thing with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you shouldn't be afraid of anything because he's the one on which the church mr. who I'm saying what a resurrection the Prophet said we'll get to that in a second that was back there what a resurrection this is see he proved the message to be true by raising from the dead he stood there in in the Gospels and declared what would take place right go back and read your Gospels of thing he declared what would transfer you know what would take place in in the day all right well what if that had never happened you say well the you just bring up the impossibilities no I'm bringing up the truth I'm asking you can you say he is risen can you say it from within you are just literal words somebody else's say it can you declare that's not like that's all the hope I have all the hope I haven't anything it's a resurrection of the Lord Jesus we have no hope in the world look at it stroke of a pen where the whole world not just one nation this has never been like this there never been a time when the whole world even when you'd say World War one everybody didn't go to war world war two everybody didn't go to war there was countries that had nothing to do with a lot of that yeah but you see now it's the whole worldwide and since driving people assure to their knees in a tort - that to me is the purpose of it people turn down the message now you look what's taking place now get what I'm saying I'm just meaning this point where just to get you to look at something that's hurts right over there they hadn't turned down the message code Elton Norton body right the most of the churches know nothing about this message think turned the message down we see it a lot of people have turned the message down you know that's what brought the plague that's what brought the plague was the people of this message turning down the message and see then the only way that's gonna be done he's like wait was talking about you got to get gonna you've got to find a way to get uh what was his name took the censer went among the people Aaron we said well brother branham was the Prophet and all I can yeah but he's not here now to take a sensor and run among the people okay no disrespect to your thoughts or whatever all right we'll see something's got to happen well I'm like this the only way I can see that it can happen is for the people the bright people to realize who they are and what they're here for we're here to proclaim the message what he is risen oh we've been doing that for 2,000 years well why hasn't he raised it's not being declared by the way it's being declared he has or will or something it's not saying he is risen see that's what I'm getting try to get you to see the proof he raised proved who he was by you receiving the baptism of the holy ghost proved he was a child of God alright proved that you were were elected and and all like that you can go through all of the thing proved it because it was is who we are and all he's doing is waiting on us to realize who we are and then when we do we can see the day in the hour we're living ok proof of the resurrection is the message that we have see if you have a bygone days and that's in your future message you're not you're not in the message I don't care if you can quote you can say everything you got all the books you got all the tapes you you know but if it's not something personal then it's not the message the Prophet was bringing because he was bringing a message to prove that he is risen well now think about it see Jesus proved the fact of him coming forth alive that he was the resurrection but that didn't end it all because you see when he came forth had it been just him raising and nothing else taking place look where you would be but instead of that he raised and when he raised he come right back in the baptism with the Holy Ghost there's the message that brings us alive he came forth isn't alive he brings forth us alive all right the baptism of the Holy Ghost is proof that direction the resurrection has already passed the resurrection being already passed already being something that was was done it's proof by you be able to receive eternal life and the baptism of the Holy Ghost see then the proof of the resurrection we have that this now to where we can say he is risen and like I said now see when you get to the point of seeing that he has risen the correct way then you'll see the seals is broke all the things are unveiled and the word is undone because that's the message the message is the message of eternal life no one ever spoke like this man did in the last days about eternal life I'm talking about in the time you know in the hour that was what caught me because I was looking for things I was desiring things from God and searching for it but when I heard a man talking about what I had experienced of seeing God and the things in him what he could do that was worse than the message become alive the message is not a quote it's something that's alive now think about it see he raised in the resurrection but he came back into the church to bring her that same resurrection right to bring her the bennet and make her the beneficiary wherever how you said of that resurrection if you'll study the message it is the rising of the Sun see then you'll understand why he said now if you look at it and see the church coming into view you know all right the church the bride coming into view all right then you can understand why he said all right said I'm gonna do this I'm gonna have to die and said I know there he didn't say that when somebody else was writing it because I said what he was saying but listen he said I'm simplifying language I'm gonna raise again now there he stood right there you stood he was the resurrection had done taken place but yet back over there before he come to there he knew what he would do and he's speaking in mark a good time before the Easter sonrise morning and he says and after three days Allah raised again again why would it use the word again it's simply it's sin seemingly implies that there's two resurrections because he had already raised there he stood he is risen he's here but away before the end he had already told him what he would do that he would rise again well why would it use it in those terminologies there's not two resurrections but there's a resurrection in many parts are what would you call it many many it would take a lot of it to include it because now listen that's what I would like for you to do sometimes when you get time to read through a little bit right at mark and read around that mark 8:31 and just look at it of the way he's saying it he's saying I dishonor man that's what I said yeah I try to make sure you don't get lost into it don't turn over the mark and say it's not hidden red-letter well there's a whole lot from Genesis to revelations it's not in red letter are you gonna take all that out if you do you got a very thin Bible alright get what I'm saying he stands there and throughout his whole message he declared that he was God the Son of man he declared all those things and he declared what would happen to this son of man and when he gets over to the point he comes from dier he comes from Genesis 1 with the son of man and he comes over and he says and then I'm all raised again that's looking at him as well what do you mean you just raised he said I'm gonna rise again alright now listen the argument between the pharisees and sadducees my understanding was that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection the Sadducees didn't believe in one night so they argue their point backwards before all right but that's what I'm asking you is it just an argument when he said I'll rise again could he not have been looking to the life stage physically there will be a resurrection come on I'm a Pharisee okay physically that will be a resurrection Sadducees huh no he's already done it he's always done is that done no Jesus was covered feel getting my point if you just read it he was covering from Genesis to write exactly where he would raise which would be sometime later from where he said that and Mark all right follow that point of what I'm talking about when you follow that point then you will see that there are strange things spoken in I guess you call it odd strange ways to hide it from the wise and prudent but that it would reveal it to the babes in other words were the bad ones with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it could be revealed to a rock and see strange things are said throughout the Bible I remember who is in a Baptist Church we used to talk about the the first resurrection you know the second resurrections and the things like that and and I want you to just start with me and the ease up through something and think about what's being said go ahead and pull up number one because you'll get it from revelations 20 verse 5 but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished now listen to his statement this is the first resurrection the ability for somebody to live a thousand years because of the fall back there and nobody's ever lived that but somebody would live that thousand years and it would be called then was this is the first resurrection now watch him blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death have no power but he shall be but they shall be priests and of God in Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years they some 1000 years here two thousand here - laughing back and forth looks like but he's not he's explaining exactly what he's talking about there's going to be a thousand year millennial reign to prove the sin curse is taken off somebody will it won't be me and you we don't have to do that but those people will be able to live a thousand years exist that period of time because of something that happens with us see the baptism with the Holy Ghost is the first resurrection right come on that simple the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a first resurrection you're gonna live the thousand years millennial reign right not because you got to the part that has to to food through the sin curses go is for somebody physically to live it and they will human people will the Jews the millennium will be for them and they'll live a thousand years to prove the sin curse is taken off what do you think we're gonna be we're gonna be right there with them but not in physical bodies like dirt bodies were you know we already be in a glorified body we've been body spirit and soul eternal and we can stay there why because we already have right here the first resurrection we don't know how to wait though they're people we'll have to wait till the time comes they'll be given life to be able to live a thousand years but we don't have to do that cuz we already have the first resurrection over which the second death hath no part you know how no power you realize the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got in you are you scared of this thing out here of all of these plagues of things humanly speaking yes there's Jitterbugs if that come when things are saying sure that's that's human that's that part we're talking about a minute ago but listen I'm not afraid of dying why cuz I already died I'm promised if I die I go to the grave but I promise the resurrection and I can go to the grave saying he is risen because one day it'll take place the devil has no power the perfect love casts out fear he's brother lluís was on group wins - yeah fear hath torment it bothers you yes and it's humanly sure but why would you be afraid that's what's wrong with the people of that's what I've tried to get people to see about it and I know it's been misunderstood but people want to scare their children with an eternal God that hates them wants them to live good wants them to do it's good to want them to live and want them to do but what make it a fear will not make it love well it's hard to tell them that God's gonna love them and he's gonna kill him he ain't gonna kill him if I kill do we kill ourselves but get what I'm saying Jesus was actually saying I've taught you all of my time with him but said I'm gonna have to be killed unless you know what's right he says don't fret don't be afraid he's because I'm gonna rise again all right now he said a statement that is outstanding when he said I am the resurrection and the life see he was standing there looking all the way through over pipes to us to the end of all things and there'll be a resurrection even the sinner will have to be raised everybody brother Ron said we'll have a resurrection see one of them is into two you know eternity and things like that bringing your body and the different things and connecting it together yeah but some they're gonna have to raise and go to the white throne and stuff like that everybody's gonna raise cuz that's the point except to those that are alive and remain that don't there's B that don't go they don't have to raise that's the wonderful thing to me and you and here's the point now they without us cannot be made perfect so the pool is going to come from the ones that are so anchored into Christ into that Holy Ghost until they're not going to die right do you believe that's going to happen according to the Bible there's going to be that somebody know how to die well they're waiting on the ones that know how to die I mean that's who I'm right now if I have to die I'm waiting on the ones that don't have to die no I've already studied the story out and I realize all I got to do is just be a part of that group in some way connecting to eternal life and then I see this message that it unfolds and things that is it's brought forth and I see your prophet talking about things like I said everybody everybody understand now my point see the first resurrection it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost the second resurrection you know how to worry about that cause you ain't gonna be no part of it second resurrection is the center dated but that ain't where he's talking about is gonna rise again no what's he talking about that's brother Branham said will o those without the baptism when the Holy Ghost will he be lost he said no listen if a person dies without the baptism of the Holy Ghost will he be lost now listen to him listen what he's saying no if he's a believer he'll come in the resurrection the second resurrection he's a believer he comes in not the first resurrection so right make him a believer he's no no no he ain't believing enough and look if he's got the baptism of Holy Ghost he'll go in the first resurrection sea over which the second death hath no part okay so there will be I'm looking for a resurrection yes but I believe the resurrection is already here within me and you okay let's let Paul make an outstanding statement I hope I don't get too long hey we got all days I worry about this one service we think look at what brother look at what Paul says I want you to pay very close attention go to number five which is Philippians now listen to a man that at this period of time then he starts speaking you could look up the dates or whatever the time he's already received the new birth he's already went back and come back out with the word and the things you know in other words he's already will just put it in my language of that's where he's come up the stature of a perfect man he's coming through those things he's getting into situations of understanding you know he's talked to Peter named he then own the stature of perfect man he knows about it he's in adoptions now listen to Paul and listen to what he says causes as it was I said Jesus looked like he was saying I'm gonna rise again well remember he was standing there and hadn't raised the first time right I'm talking about mark where I was reading that know where the scriptures we go now listen to what Paul comes up yeah doubtless doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of many things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith now a man with a great ability the great position he was stand-in in theologies and could talk to you about anything in connecting the old testament to the new and and all of the things and come in with the new birth and standing there talking look what he says that i may know him and the power of his resurrection Oh Paul you're already born again what are you doing I'm trying to get you to look at something I want you to understand something that I may know him you mean you don't know him you already gotten here yes I do but there's more to it than just to say the new birth there's a growth development there's the stature there's an adoption there's all of the things that goes with it now listen to what he says in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead all what kind of language you're using what are you saying you you have the new birth you're not into all of that law teaching deals of all of the days and the life you straighten all of that out and Galatians and the Corinthians I yeah what do you mean if by any means in other words I'm longing for something undesirable to the resurrection of the Dead he's already in the first resurrection by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has no worry of death he has no way that the second death can bother him arena what do you talk about Paul you sound like that you you you sound like you're playing in one word that you're you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're you're up in the heart with the Apostles and dying and said but now looks like you're saying well you know I don't know whether I'm gonna be there not he said no that's okay read the next verse not as though I had already attained now he looks like he's doubting either we're already perfect now he's explaining truth where he was standing Paul was standing at a place that he needed something to happen to bring him to perfection with a heaven Newberg yeah but he didn't have the in down message I'll just set that away okay not as though I had already a time in other words Jesus is he's saying I'm not where I want to be I want to attain unto the resurrection of the Dead well probably you're scared you ain't going right no that ain't what I'm talking about I think what I'm trying to bring not as though had already attained I said I have an attack yet to the through this position that I won't but I'm not lost but I'm not perfect I'm not complete not as though had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus if that I may app may apprehend for that which also I am apprehended of cross Jesus brethren I count not myself to have apprehended you you're not where you want to be no he's not worried want to be he's not worried wanted to be I'm not where I want to be are you where you want to be I'm glad to be where I'm at I'm cherish the point I'm glad were a mass but I'm not happy where I'm at because I see something else I see what's bothering me but I can't knock myself to have apprehended with this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto that think those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling and God in Christ Jesus I press toward the perfection that I want now thank it said I'm glad we've got a profit due that way wasn't asked the profit okay so I'm asking brother Branham brother Branham you're supposed to be the profit you're supposed to lead us through you supposed to be ologist now you're the one that all this is to come to to help us to understand the word and what's wrong with Paulo one minute he looks like he's as perfect as can be in his glory in a minute and then the next minute he's he's saying I'm not where I want to be I want to be somewhere that I want something else to happen but yet look at him other as we call him for his day the Prophet would say for his day he was the greatest height of all the apostles wouldn't you agree without her I mean he was no different in them but yet he he was to the the Gentiles to the people he was a messenger to the church age look all the things the great Apostle Paul was yet he's saying I'm still not where I want to be now let me lay a little bit in here do you think that Paul would be waiting on you if you don't then you're not getting the point of I'm talking about Paul's waiting on me in you that's what he's talking about that's what he's talking about here he's talking about now I'd like to find a place that I could attain unto a resurrection of the dead nothing I haven't already attained in the new birth neither that not saying that I'm not where I want to be in Christ but saying I'm not where I want to be I want more I want more go ahead to number five and let's just read and see what your prophet says this is talking about they remember what he said if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead now what's he talking about go ahead brothers pull up number six which is taken from the sardian Church H wrote Iran opens and you can read those things and you are you go if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the Dead now this statement is most peculiar we all know that we are all going to be in a resurrection whether we want to be or not all will be resurrected so Paul could hardly be saying if by any means I might attain to a resurrection of the Dead because that's not what he's saying that's what he said that ain't what he say it right that's the words he used if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection look at the Prophet so Paul could hardly be saying if by any means I might attain to a resurrection of the dead the truth of the matter is he is not saying that he's not saying what's your reading that he's saying you know that's crazy no you got to get into what I was saying about the Lord Jesus there's a lot of things that are stated when Jesus said that he might rise again he hadn't even raised yet and he looks like there's more to cover the resurrection there is and was at the time he was standing there listen to Paul the literal reading is if by any means I might attain to the out resurrection from among the dead the resurrection he's not trying to be in any way raised or not listen this is not the attaining to the general or second resurrection who you know Pauline will be there but attaining to the first resurrection it's something pertaining to your resurrection that you want to be Paul to be attained to an out resurrection out of what okay this is not the attaining to the general or second resurrection but attaining to the first resurrection of which it is said blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection on such the second death has no part but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second he goes into what we come but want to go Paul what do you say an out resurrection from among the dead now Paul's walking around with people they're walking and talking into eating as I but as far as he's concerned they're dead and probably said I don't want to be left here with this book is dead people the nomination aliy did all the rest this is the end this is at the end of the thousand years when all the rest of the dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forward to eternal life so he's explaining it listen out resurrection out from denominationalism but but wait a minute Paul didn't know Paul that's Paul's trouble that's what people's trouble was but Paul recognized it Paul said I've got problems he said I've been born again I've come through these things and I'm I don't count it don't brag on myself but set a price myself above the Apostles because I've come up to that place and ain't none of them added he said one word to them is that his word all said none of them added one word to him pretty good place to be standing but he said still there's a bunch of dead people here now bring that down to where we are now and you'll see the things and you'll see why brother Branham said what he did they're going together with what we've been talking about a resurrection you realize the day you was born again and us brought down your new birth started the growth development statue a perfect man etc but see we're not happy we're not pleased with it we want more of what we've got that was Paul's idea then when he called it to out resurrection he was just simply saying out from among the dead you realize I'm not throwing no stones for nothing do you realize that the bride of Jesus Christ is walking in the world of dead people there's a lot of people in that dead people that's gonna get to heaven one day so we're not going off on nobody there's the foolish virgins there's the Jews there's all kind of groups a lot more than they are of us that's gonna get to heaven so we're not throwing off on nobody but just being plain to the little bride that understands what you're here for and what we're doing see then you're having an out resurrection you realize the day you're born again you had an out resurrection you realize that out resurrection is still taking place as that word is being unveiled to us and unfolding and keeps on unfolding it is an out resurrection you see why that I'm so hard and strong I know and I beat it and not like that of trying to get people to study the seals the seventy weeks of Daniel the the marriage and divorce the the message of the hour to see are we still caught in dead denominationalism let's see is it rising her son what brother Ron said he said I'm afraid that we're not getting the people that Jesus Christ we're getting them to doctrines and ideas but we're not getting them he said to Jesus Christ why because we're not doing this Paul struggling to have an out resurrection out from among the dead we're not trying to leave these things no but get from out among the dead okay now let me say just a word or two about this other part doctor see when Jesus said he would raise again I asked the question I asked it again could he have been looking from back there in Genesis all the way to the Book of Revelations and finally I found a lot is it in the resurrection sea then he would be raised and again he's gonna raise again the life stage not in a natural resurrection Coast he don't need one he don't need a natural resurrection you and I are the ones gonna be he don't need one even in the end of thing but if you're not out we're gonna need a natural resurrection if we don't die you're going to have to get out of that out resident into that powers in the out resurrection out away from our denominational ideas and opinions of this message and what we believe about it and what we've called it this and called it that instead of taking it for what he's saying and letting God speak to us the brother branham on this arise another son I won't get to it over this makes a statement he said there's going to be a resurrection in the last days from according to melikhaya for Luke 17 30 what kind of resurrection not a physical that's already done it's already stamped seals that we're going to have everybody's gonna have a resurrection those who don go down are gonna be resurrected but those who don't have to die they'll have to have a resurrection but they've got to walk in the light to get out of that out resurrection has got to be applied to us to get away from our own ideas and thoughts at what we think it is to get down to what it is and saying well the Prophet said it he said that to be a out resurrection of what from the denominational ideas that we have and that sheath we'll get back to it that shieff is to be waived he said it's to be waived again that sheaf was waived back there because Jesus raised from the dead he was waived over the church ascended up on high come back and waived under there Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring the new birth that's to happen again when it comes to the headstone the finality of this life days there is to be another refilling of the Holy Ghost yes there is to be those things in the last days because it's to the people who realize what's taking place and then that sheaf is to be waved from according to Malachi 4 according to Luke 1730 in other words bread around home axes that's what we'll get to we'll get to come back into this pick up a little bit and he says there will be a message read it from Chrysler from its rising the Sun didn't we'll get back he said they will be a message swing forth and here he is in 65 I think it's right on this and he's talking about something to come and it looks like to a lot that he's doubting what has already come no he's explaining one thing if you'll read it this away he's explaining Jesus Christ rose and was waived then that Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost and it went down through 7 Church ages and it went into the nomination ilysm etc etc then we must have an out resurrection to get out of that we must get out of that of our own selves and you know in our being design and come forth with that sheaf to be waved again in the last day sure brother branham was the first to come to maturity I agree with that wholeheartedly he was picked up and waved over you and I to show what is to come but you know what I'm gonna say it honestly one chief won't feed the world one chief is just a handful is that all you want no I want the whole field I want what it's out there for me to live off of I want the Word of God brother Branham brought the Word of God and receive wave in there overs ride but now that must come into you and me if not we need an out resurrection that's what we need we need an out resurrection out of our own ideas and thoughts see he says there is to be a message missing in the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders than he did back there see so he's gonna raise again and then it's odd the way he says it harder how that the Bible is for three days was the Bible say after 2,000 years in the third day is that the scripture something's to happen in the third day because our for the message is to come alive in you and me okay come on musician get too much to try to put it in but we're gonna get into the chief wave and what we're gonna try to get into that sheath wave is to find out some strange statements brother Branham made are like he said that Mary was not the seed she was just a carrier well that would mean Azusa Street was false no I mean what he's talking about he's telling it like it is he's bringing that forth we're supposed to be those seed was in Mary and birthed out entire stood the word if Mary representative looser Street and that's what the Prophet said she did then okay there's got to be a people that become the seed not to give birth to it that's part of the story but to become the very seed itself out of dark denominationalism a resurrection now do you see why the Prophet said what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is to realize what we've got to do it's not that we have a choice of doing or in no it's got to be done if not then we call keep waiting on each other with somebody is going to come to the place and be like Paul he said I want an out resurrection I'm happy where I'm at don't try to take that away but I want some mower right let's tan thank own these things what a resurrection that would what a resurrection is he is until that's all I want you [Music] I was thinking night this morning about a summation had unfolded itself how did I could stand in 1969 and declare the bride of Jesus Christ would lead the Son of Man the Word made flesh see it today [Music] looking at what he's doing he's revealing his word to you later [Music] do you wanna round that direction to get rid of mind about a long time ago - I said this God got me out of there banished now he needs to get to badness out of me because that was my problem that's still my problem oh dear and they're on the high carbon assignments yes what an Easter time that is what a resurrection years things are coming device so Christ until you can't keep up with it you know one day the next one's gonna hate you don't know whether you'll be able to go to church my food you yeah we better get serious but not serious about what we're going to get together we're gonna do like they said they were gonna do somewhere there's a thousand people who are gonna go protest and is gonna protest cause the church wouldn't been able to operate all that's gonna do is cause trouble what would it do if they did what is it done if they laid it down and freed us up to where we could just all come i wanna i want that disease or thing whatever it is i want that thing gone because as long as that thing's here we got trouble you got something that will cover a whole world in ever nation now des coming and going but you see we also held the right to pray i know you i know everybody here in what they're doing but the other day when they called and told me said a little back said they sent her home said they don't know they hadn't heard from the test yet but said it's a possibility that she's got this disease go to your knees and start praying go call out to God for everything to be all right supposed to bend Friday I think I believe it's right now and we're supposed to be in this coming Friday before they could get the test done called him yesterday and said everything's negative well leave and pray and thank God for it then we lose one well but we lose him on a good Friday I'm in a good Easter time but we know her he that needs to you know if we were always its concerned as he was I appreciate all the years that I've been able to know brother dick dick Addison you know I you know had some wonderful fellowship in time he's always had that one thing he wants to talk about the Lord in God's Word yeah was okay now he's getting his part a reward he ain't waiting on I mean he's waiting on us now we've been waiting on him to other day but now he's waiting on us because he's going to earn and he's gonna have to be brought forth so somebody's gonna have to call for it so let's believe it and do that remember not no services afternoon just gonna have you good time as a Easter time and you know it's hard to exist in this world and the way it's going but we've got to it's not to throw up your hands and quit where you gonna quit you move over about four feet you have it six feet you move over six feet and you say I won't move over here and quit well there's another blocker I don't know what our when the store the other day and I was laughing about it I said I got to go from here to there and then desire and then when I get dark and I order my food yeah I said okay I'll take that and I ordered my food and then I have to go over here and stand on the spot way to pay for it that's never been in nothing like this nothing before where ever existed that away but you know we don't throw stones but you know the Bible speaks of them the Prophet did

through a lot in her life her shoulders was bad and different things now and so you know she's better off as we said you don't want to say that as a disrespect to anybody she said as a respect this he's better off because she's went to a better part you know in doing that okay I want to thank you again all for coming all of you that are outside I just thought for a second we would do this since
