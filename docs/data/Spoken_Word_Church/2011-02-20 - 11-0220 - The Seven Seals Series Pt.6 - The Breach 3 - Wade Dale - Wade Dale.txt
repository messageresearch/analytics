========================================

we're gonna finally get started everybody's doing well today good to be back in the good state of Georgia what it is we uh had a good time at the funeral if you can stay having a good time but we do when we know that a Christian goes to heaven we have a good time and going home I'm a soldier revelation's five finally gonna read it now what we were last week we were kind of going through everything and and uh showing that it had to happen in the end time it couldn't happen any other age when the coming of the son of man was to be so real so he was actually going to be here in Bradford it had to be at the end time remember we read Luke 17 and 30. and then we at the end red revelation 5. all right so Revelation 5. now this is the scene and we're going to play this scene out but it's a reality to you and I but it's a scene that remember John was only given the commission to write what he saw not to interpret it but to write the scenes that he saw John saw one sitting on the throne that's what he wrote down all right he was not given the Revelation see the Revelation was given in the end time brother Brown said reading between the lines reading that love letter now down through the church ages they did read between the lines in certain instances because the father son of Holy Ghost baptism did not come in until nice end 325 A.D so before that time man did read between the lines the Holy Ghost let him read that love letter saying it was the Lord Jesus Christ it was to be that was the correct baptism and that there was one God and not another not three but then in Isaiah when Satan gets in he starts corrupting the word you know and so they take that baptism out and put in titles they take out the one God and put in three well that didn't change the word of God the word of God's still written like it was and uh and and really it wasn't written in 325 A.D the Bible wasn't really compiled until about the 1500s as far as we can read it all right as far as the King James version or not like 16-11 version of the Bible but they did have the Scrolls they still had the Old Testament then you had Paul's writing you had all these people's writings that were in Scrolls and they could just get bits and pieces of it so John comes on the Isle of Patmos and that's why he was actually put there was because he was trying to take the scroll right remember he's trying to take the Scrolls and write the Bible put put the commentaries together Matthew Martin Luther King John and all that and they boiled him in All for 24 hours and that didn't kill him so they put him on Patmos and exiled him and then God said okay I got you out here by yourself I'm going to show you what it is to come because Jesus told him he said there'll be some standing here among you that will see the kingdom coming in power and it wasn't John John didn't see the actual Kingdom he saw it in Vision or in in a scene in heaven but you got to remember if something is written in the Bible in God's mind it's already happened right right see that's what that's what we got to realize we got to see that those pieces have to match my brother the other priests the matching pieces what's in heaven me and another brother got talking about that this this Friday I guess it was or Thursday Friday and uh you really never seen it that way but that's the truth because what happened in heaven is done finished and God's mind is over so this is God's mind coming to John so we can write it because this has already happened because Revelations 5 shows us already in glory already redeemed and the lamb opened in the seals but it has to happen in a reality form because John types the bride one man topped the entire bride all right but now John was a part of that bride but he was not commissioned to reveal anything that anybody sure he went back and Pastor the church there in Ephesus but um to be real honest with you the people at Ephesus started getting away from what they said and God had to bring Iranians on the scene right remember brother round said one Church age messenger comes he brings his message he goes off the scene people cares it on them when the people start eroding are are watering down the message God raises up another man on the same called irenius and what does he do he rebukes the previous age for getting away from Paul's message then what does he do he brings his own message takes it to another generation or to another church age right so that's the continuity of God so here we are in Revelation 3 the church ages are over here we are Revelation chapter 4 showing a scene in heaven right because remember in chapter 4 verse 7 it says it shows the combat piece in anywhere the combat beasts are there's where the bride is go back into Ezekiel and read son of man prophesy and brother Brown I'm in the seals we're going to see where the those combat beats wrote out in the lion ox man and the eagle wrote out to combat the red horse the black horse The Pale Horse I mean the the white the red the black and the Pale Horse they rolled out and then when brother Brown saw they were gone on that fifth seal he said the Raptor had to take place on the for sale because there's no more combat being right so the combat Beast is what that's right it's Bible Matthew Mark Luke and John all right we'll get into that but Matthew perfectly types the line Mark the ox Luke was a what physician he was smart he was a man intelligent and then Eagle was John the prophetic because look what John did John Wayne and Richard did write a higher form of the scripture than any of the other three and basically him and Matthew were the only two that were literally with god with the Lord when he was on Earth Mark was a commentary and Luke was a commentary Luke was not actually there when Jesus was there all right but Luke says having perfect understanding he wrote the Book of Luke right by the holy spirit so chapter four shows the us around the throne the combat Beast there so that's where the bride is the Four B's each had six wings full of eyes within and rest not Dan not saying holy holy Lord Almighty which was what is and is to come 420 Elders you've got everybody there then chapter five and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne now go back to verse 2 of chapter four and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne one the bride's caught up in Revelation 4 right through this Open Door let's just read it on that way I wasn't gonna go this way but I feel like we need to because you got to get that person sitting on the throne that's right right chapter four and after this what after these three after these three chapters after three after these seven churches one two and three chapter one two and three is what the church ages the last one's number seven there in verse 14 goes over 21 and 22. he'd have an inlet in here now that's our age after this John said what after the ages I looked and behold a door was open in heaven so he's on Earth looking at a door opening in heaven and we go up through that door because it's an Open Door all right which type of what rapture and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet what the message a voice talking with me which said come up hither there is your catching away there is your rapture you're catching away of the Bride not the coming of Christ that the whole world is going to see this is the secret bride coming of Christ because because John says after this what verse chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 is the bride being called out of the seven Church ages everybody understand that say amen amen okay all right which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter what in heaven and immediately I was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne where in heaven but now you're going to have to convert that into us because he's got to sit on this Throne before we go see him on that throne and he that sat was to look upon like Jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow around about the throne in sight like into an emerald and round about The Throne were four in 20 seats and upon the seats I saw Four and Twenty Elders sitting clothed in Black Raymond and they had on their head crowns of gold now who are the 24 elders The Twelve Apostles and the 12 Patriarchs the 12 apostles being I can't name them all but it was Matthew all the way through Mathias which was the last one it took judas's place he'll be sitting there because he was chosen to take that part then you've got the 12 Patriarchs which is Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and I can't name them all but I'll find them all because I wasn't going this way so we'll come back maybe and pick them up but I want you to see the scene who was there who was there the people the dignitaries that were there all right and out of the throne proceeded lightning and thundering and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are what right there seven golden candlesticks seven churches the same thing in Revelations one one on that throne and around about The Throne puts him where in the midst right he got a throne and they're around about The Throne where is he at is in the midst just like he was in the midst of the candlesticks that's right same scene just pulling it up higher it's going to Revelation one John saw the same thing now he's saying the same thing over again but he's seeing a little more of that same scene does everybody understand that same man all right everybody see that so around about The Throne puts him in the midst all right what was around about that throne 420 elders let's step over here just a second let's show the people on maybe you can see that which are the seven spirits of God what was the seventh Spirit God sent to the end of the church changes to what bring out a bride and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass around and said that glass or brass judgment already done in the midst of the throne and around about The Throne were four beasts in the midst of the throne and round about the throne not just around the throne see the 24 Elders were around the throne which put him in the midst but this says in the midst and round about the in the midst of the throne makes it personal right here and around about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before behind what the bride around the throne was the bride and the first Beast was like a lion see this is your combat beast from Ezekiel one we're going to get back to those combat beasts all right and the first Beast was like a lion a second like a calf the third had the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle not one sitting down on the nest or sitting down on the ground he was flying and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes Within within where does revelation come from within not your natural seeing eyes it comes from inside see within c means to understand okay every time you see the word see and it doesn't mean visual or optimia Optical it means understand full of they were full of eyes Within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy Lord God Almighty which was is and is to come and when those beasts gave glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the Four and Twenty Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy O Lord they were seeing glory and honor and power for thou hats created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created so who was that on the throne Creator God you know what you said for these things for thou has created all things who created all things the son son of God was the creator of all things Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh Jesus Christ created all things all right we'll get to the son of man in a minute because these people listen these people made it to heaven unto the son of god mentioned because they died The Twelve Apostles the Patriarchs all but the people all but the bride and most of the Bride did there were just a few groups of people that standing there that didn't taste deaf now that was a revelation John didn't have that's the reason in verse 5. because see to me the Bible man put the chapters in there but most of the time to me a chapter just flows from one right into the other and actually in the original if you'll read it it just flows from one to number 56. it don't go chapter one through ten then chapter two one through twenty you know it goes right it just it's just a continuous read right so to me this is a continuous read all right now what's John going to do John knows Thou Art Worthy O Lord who did this Four and Twenty elders Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and Power for thou Hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created correct and now John sees he's standing watching John is caught up and he's watching a scene the scene in chapter four is us there right I just proved we were there right chapter five John's got to tell us how we got there that's why you got to read it chapter four we're there we're caught up in a rapture but God had to show a group of people how to get there it had to be by what there's only one way you got there by Redemption a bloody lamb that's what everybody got in common in this scene right here and if I'm not mistaken I didn't see an earth a Heavenly angel in that whole chapter four you ever notice that I actually just caught that a little while ago myself angels are not redeemable he said oh that's the Four B's they're not angels Angels don't have wings um Angels don't have wings it's a symbolic symbols but there's no Before the Throne with the sea of glass missed the throne round about The Throne of what four beats provide the four behind Four B's and those beasts gave glory and thanks to Four and Twenty Elders they were white men right humans that had been made immortal angels are not there why this is redemption right angles have no part in Redemption except for to influence you my brother Dale's been preaching they cannot give you salvation there's only one man the Bible says one man can give you salvation and that's Jesus Christ amen okay and he was a man it's not an angel brother Brown said when we get to Glory we're not going to be Angels we're going to be human beings men women right so the angels are not here now watch he said oh well you got your you know your four B saying holy holy holy they're not Angels those are symbolics that's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not an angel as far as a little angel a little messenger he's the big a right Christ right but that's the spirit of those of us the lion ox man and the eagle brother Brown said we'll read it again here in the fourth or fifth cell he'll say those combat beings were put on here to do one thing and that's to help you that's right wherever you need in your life you say oh well there's Angels they're not Angels like the Angels were created in back in the old you know back for the world this was a specific group and there's only one thing that helps us through life and that's the Holy Ghost right so the Holy Ghost is a lion oxman an eagle which is Matthew Mark Luke and John the four the order not version but the four books in the Bible that tells you actually all of the Bible is written out of Matthew Martin Luther King John right where'd Paul get his writings from right he heard from different ones that's what Jesus preached exactly that's the word himself right was giving his three and a half year message did all of this other has come from every bit of this even down here now over in the end times where we're already you know up in glory in chapter four that come from what Matthew Martin Luther and John put into writing that happened to Jesus and the words that he spoke he said my words are what truth and life right all right so they had to be put into words right okay excuse me so Matthew Martin Luther and John all right so here we're talking about what then what is the theme of this whole actually from one through five what is the same Redemption man had fell man needed her savior man needed the Holy Ghost to keep it person clean and then that's what put us in glory right all right now we'll move over into chapter six in just a little bit but we still got a few weeks to go maybe in chapter five we ain't even really got to talking about chapter five yet but we gotta have a foundation we got a foundation all right let's read chapter five again and I'm going to read it all and then we'll come back and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne of book written within and on the back side seal with seven sealed now remember who is this one sitting on the throne the Creator God Son of God Creator God the one that created the world right in that form because that's what he said he was created thou Hast created all things all right now remember when Jesus was standing here in flesh the Creator God was in him but he in that flesh was not the Creator right Paul said Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of living God right now they knew that's why they couldn't understand the son of man they couldn't understand this flesh man standing here yet before Abraham was I am that's why they've got a hold of him they said you've been 50 years old how in the world Abraham was 600 years ago you're not 600 years old they just didn't understand what was inside of that man all right so that's where you got to get this scene right right look I said Luke said the Christ of God the Christ of God is straight up yeah that was that was Landing out pretty pretty plain right all right so now and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne who created God Son of God Spirit God red went in on the backside still with seven seagulls because that man is the one that took that book away from Adam right right that man is the one back in the Garden of Eden that took the ability for Adam to bring you and I forth that man has the on is the only person that has the book there's only one book right there's many sections in that book right but this book right here is the book of me and you this is the bride's book right here okay sit on the throne I'm sorry and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals now they had already worshiped in chapter four telling him he was Worthy he was Worthy Thou Art Worthy but somehow thou is going to have to become us right now and I strong saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now you see one angel coming in a strong Angel a different angel and no man man man man man man I circled that in my Bible because this is talking about flesh man okay and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth in other words those are buried was able to open the book neither to look their own and I wealth much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look their own now brother Branham we'll read in a minute while we won't read the day we'll start reading next week I'm not going to promise that but we'll start reading it so make sure you bring your books next week neither to look their own Prophet said all the prophets were there the Four and Twenty Elders were there everybody was down because remember chapter five has got to tell us how we got there chapter four shoulders already there chapter five is trying to tell us how to get there all right or showing how we got there right and one of the elders said unto me week not what he turned and looked and saw something excuse me behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof and I'll be held and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders here appear in the lamb having what seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth and all the Earth John is telling you where Jesus is standing and that's in the golden candlesticks in the midst seven horns and seven eyes which are what the seven spirits of God sent to do what preach to man through the seven Church ages Irene is Paul Luther Martin Wesley Elijah all those people got it now be held in low in the midst of the throne not a round about the throne in the midst of the throne and we'll look at this scene maybe next Sunday stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which were the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he Jesus Christ the lamb they're the only one John said behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world the son of man had to come and die right so he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne who was sitting on the throne Son of God now Jesus told us right back over on the other page if you guys go to the Bible he said behold I stand at the door and knock to him and overcome it will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I have also overcome and I'm sat down with my father in his throne all right all right everybody listening and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book son of man taking the book the four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints us the sainted ones brother Ram said to sanctify people and they sang a new song they bunch of people sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof or thou what slain and hath redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation and has made us not the four beasts in that saying not the angels us was the bride and has made us under our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign if you look in Schofield the original is we shall reign over the Earth but I like this one it says on the Earth because that's what you're going to do we're going to rule and Reign where right here so that's the scene of the Bride and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels now here comes the angel round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them were Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands and thousands of thousands why did the Angels come in it was over so they're there now to worship they have no clue see this is I believe brother Brown said this is that moment of silence somewhere in the in or somebody was preaching it one time because there was no there was no angels worshiping how can you worship something that you don't know but once all that's over and the angels see that we all made it and we were done and finished and and everything and right here said we will rain on the earth that was it it's done we're finished now here comes the angels and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and a number of them were Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand and thousands of thousands then with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and reaches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth judges are in the sea and all that of them hurt eyes saying blessed and honor glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and into the lamb forever and ever and the Lord be said so be it amen and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever then John goes into the scene of the actual breaking of the seals because Brethren is going to tell us he said in Revelations 5 that's when the seals were open the next time you see that lamb chapter six tell us what happens but over in Revelation 10 you see that angel that man coming down that angel Mighty Angel Christ come down with a book open all right here it's closed there it's open all right so now we got to look at this and I'll give you something to think about because you got to see it as not two people that was not the Lamb of God and the Son of God standing there looking at each other it wasn't two people that's right because there's no two people that's why brother Brown I'm gonna eat that first seal he saw two people one of them had to be the God and the other one had to be the devil so there was not two people in this scene that was that was taking of the book and all that it was it's in symbol form because brother Brown said the lamb took the book and come and sat down on the throne we'll get we'll read it and we'll go through what brother random explained but you got to see though it's not like and and you really you can't explain it you really can't explain it because if I took two pieces or two you know Cuts you'd say well you got two it was two manifestations of God standing there not two persons of God standing there in that scene because the Son of God had to come to do what cleanse and claim the Earth this I mean the inside of man so the man had to claim the Earth he's heir of the earth son of God's air of Heaven inside here all right so you gotta you gotta look at it like there was two manifestations and then they come one but you don't do away with the other one you just put one inside the other one really is what you can do with the cups and set them down and say are they they're it's always one but you have to look at the two manifestations that's why that people in 325 A.D that's why they come up with all these they had an intelligent view of God right Jesus come to Earth father was up here Holy Ghost was over here they said well they must be three persons because they can't all be there at the same time because they just couldn't understand that God can be anywhere he wants to at one time he'd be in a million places at one time he's speaking to you today and he may be speaking to somebody in the same instant 4 000 miles from here right same person not another person the same person how do you think we all going to be able to see Jesus when we get to heaven we're gonna have to wait our turn I don't think so we say when Jesus the flesh came air of all things he took the book and when he took that book see it claimed it back to Adam he was the second Adam remember we'll get into that because the first item lost it but that first Adam was there of this Earth if he had not messed up and done what he did he would have done just what Jesus did he would have come to her he would have been the the heir of what all the Earth and we would have been heir to the Earth with him because we would have come out from him well see the first Adam got cut off what happened to the second Adam second Adam God takes back the ability from the first Adam for me and you to come the way we were supposed to because we came anyway permissive will but what's the end going to be the same thing as what the beginning was he just took that Holy Ghost and put it down inside you now and now he's got to work on this guy this outside fella he didn't have to work on the outside Adam before the fall but now he has to work on the outside guy me and you because we come through sex through a nature that we were given a worldly nature that's why they say the Bible says the first Adam was that was earthy second Adam is what Lord from Glory Jesus said you must be born again Nicodemus said I gotta go back to my mama's womb he said no you gotta be born from love in other words the Holy Ghost has to come down and reside in this human flesh now and then that makes us from the second Adam that makes us what we should have been had there not been a fall that's right when we're changed when we're standing in Revelation 5 excuse me when he told us we'd be Kings and Priests we're standing just like we would have stood in in the Garden of Eden had not been a fall same but now let me let me let me warn you about something to a group of people that's going to take a body change this has got to be fulfilled on Earth this Revelations 5 has got to come down with that Mighty angel that's why Revelations 5 Revelations 10 are together this has got all these people made it under the Son of God Revelation but there's a group of people that was hid inside of this group of people and the only reason they made it to Revelation 5 was because somebody stood just like I'm telling you again I go back to that same scripture all power and Heaven and Earth being given unto me nothing can withstand me not even death so once that happens then we go to heaven then we see all these things no the only thing to remember is after the ages will have the Holy Ghost in their soul that's right nobody had their sub their spirit and body redeemed to go in a Rapture right that's why the cells had to come was to get that if you're already born again you don't need that that's right no you need your your spirit and your body redeemed and that's what brother Brown had to come back and do that twine come was to get this flesh and the spirit underneath the road right to where we could go in a raptor because nobody else ever did that nope that's great what's Happening Here is this scene and and and you know probably millions of people Christians say well this has been this is in heaven boy when we get to heaven this is going to happen that's true but this is going to happen to somebody on Earth that's right now let me give you one more point to ponder before next Sunday revelation 3. brother Brown said the bride is caught up in Revelation chapter four and not seen again until Revelations 19. everybody understand that yeah because we are caught up in this Open Door in 4-1 this is in heaven the rest of this is to the Jews literally happens on the Earth the Seal's open down here all right we got to go but but listen to me this has got to happen to somebody spiritually right Revelation 4 2 19 219 not 2 2 19. Revelations 4 to the chapter of Revelations 19 has gonna happen to a group of people that will not see death okay the rest of us or anybody will have to go by the grave have to be resurrected and this thing will happen but something's gonna happen down here on Earth but that seems to have a good movie
