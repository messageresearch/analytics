speak to our hearts we commit it all to you now in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 1-3 remember this is a study of the Book of Revelations and what is the Book of Revelations is a revelation of Jesus Christ am so that's what we're why we keep reading verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel un to his servant John who be record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw so blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand First Peter 1 ver9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your Souls which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you search searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it before when it testified beforeand the sufferings of Christ and the glory see not just showing his crucifixion but showing the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from from Heaven which things that Angels desired to look into desire to look into wherefore G up the loins of your mind and be sober and hope to the end for the grace see right Grace amen that's right Grace is unmerited favor amen God promised it thank you we'll take it amen for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ right you may be seated the Lord in his Blessing the reading of word I chose to give you the quotes you know for everybody personally those that are on the internet can pull them off and read them but I chose to give you these to where that you would uh you know say well we can sit down and read and think on these things even though we have seen them on the screen we can take them home with us and ponder over it now I pray this afternoon that you will listen attentively to what I've tried to say and the Lord has given me maybe a a way to express it and you know I'm a funny person I I'm a firm believer in God and his ways of doing and uh you know if it took a fishing trip to understand how to present something well then I can enjoy the fishing trip and have a good time and then I come back doubly loaded because I come back with God speaking to me and I'm not the person I'm sorry I've never been and I've never tried to hide it I'm not a prayer Warrior I'm not you know that a lot of people call them I'm not one that uh does a lot of things like people will say and do I have spent my entire life studying the Bible and studying the message and now the benefits I read from that is sometimes even though I have got older and getting more forgetful and I realize that you know that that wees out with you but still it's amazing sometimes when you get by yourself and thinking that the Lord can just drop down and talk to you and you don't spend a week or two talking to you though that's what everybody thinks you know they say I talked with the Lord the other day and he talked with me for three or four hours well I'm not saying it didn't now forgive me don't think I am I'm just saying when he speaks to me it's in just a short word that's right that's it that's right and then I come here in 3 months I try to preach it yeah but you know uh so he did it is a vast thing but I I you know I just made different to be that I guess and everybody's made the way they supposed to be so forgive me just bear with me and just pray for me all right but now we covered we've been covering up to and gotten up now to which we will start on in a little while on verse 8 of the fifth chapter and try to you know look into something I spoke to you about it this morning you know at the end of the service but now we're going to deal with it and try to express something to you and uh you know the main thing that I've tried to get you to see is you know I spent entire Services trying to express to you right that the book must be completed before the lamb takes to bre right you know that would be like taking half the Bible if you you know you just right if you didn't do it that way see you'd just be taking half the Bible and say well the other part's not important no it is very very important and the Bible is in perfect order amen now I know I got into a discussion with some brothers years ago about some things and and all of them seem to have the idea or thought that the Book of Revelations was not in what you would call it chronological order but I differ with that I did then and I do now I believe it's laid out perfectly in order amen it is the word of God it is not something that you have to shuffle the cards to get them to come back around you know and jump from here to there to leave it you're going to leave a gap you're going to leave an understanding and I've emphasize over and over and will again today that the prophet say the fifth chapter is a preparation for the opening right of the Seven Seals right and he said if we don't get to preparation correct look where we miss it and like I emphasize this morning John was specially chosen to go to patmas Y right I wasn't you wasn't Paul wasn't Peter wasn't nobody else was chosen but John cuz it meant something that he would be the one that be in the prophetic realm of line that he would even in his writings of the Book of John you know before going to pmas that when he would come back he would have that ability even still in you know instilled in him he was the only one that called it the Antichrist Paul called it Grievous wolves Etc John went there and saw it right so we come back calling it The Antichrist the only time in the Little John's there and see after all was said and done look what John wound up doing he just come down to in and brother R said he would just come old man and said he' just sit around and say little children love one another why he had seen the Apex height you know of love right he had seen and was revealed to him the things that would happen on Earth but the main thing was not see it would be nice to to be able to get something in advance but you might be like the guy was that I remember an old movie maybe some of you remember that way on back in I seen it and I remember it that a guy was getting a newspaper a day ahead of everybody you probably saw that and remember it and see he could go out and bet on the horse races he could he could buy stock he could just do everything because he was ahead of everybody and he was doing wonderful until they happened to read in the bituary that he died the day before so you know that's the kind of what most people want to know right my emphasis not a joke of that see most people want to know what's going to happen right sure uh who's going to be president uh who's going to be this what's going to happen here what's going to be there see and that's more interesting to them because you see their emphasis is upon uh events right that are transpired or something you know and and and you know but I don't believe John was interested in that I don't believe the joy that he had in his heart come from being able to know what would happen down through time right he was overjoyed in the understanding of the revelation of Jesus Christ amen that was made known to him while he was on patas and all the Journey of Christ down Through the Ages that would come out and be all the way through the Bible and see everything you know and in doing that that was why he would be rejoicing it's in the fifth chapter here we get down to it you know he said every creature in heaven every creature on earth heard him not he heard them they heard him screaming Glory Hallelujah now right back up above there these angels and and Elders is shouting so much until Heaven is just filled well you know what about all of this you know that you can have this a great hola you know going on uh a great benefit going on and just everything going so loud and all at once over the top of ever been that you could just hear somebody just a holler Glory Hallelujah yeah I see Jesus amen cuz I've never tried to get you to see nothing else right amen that's right that's but see Jesus all right and when you see him brother said when you see him begin to see the word you seeing Christ he said if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse right go back and read it again so I believe we need to put everything in order and then we can understand it we can follow it right down the line to where everything is been but just remember now and see to anybody listening please give me the benefit of being a human uh I don't know how to express a lot of things but see the book has to be completed and the book it it if the lamb left The Mercy Seat he's going to leave The Mercy Seat as quick as the quick as the book is finished right you know there going to be a short period of time he's going to leave the mercy seat right when the book is finished and all the names that we spoke of this morning all right and then see Redemption would be over right well if it was 2,000 years ago see all right it was over but then we bring it down if said no no it was 1963 is when the lamb well then Redemption was over in 63 right Y and most of all of us are lost right see so we know that's not true that's not the understanding right in the opening of the the seals as a vast difference between opening and the Gentile dispensation by the holy spirit being able to by the prophet messenger the seals to be open that we could understand what has been what is and what will be right and still it not even be happened in reality right amen yeah you know we know what's going to be the future home right amen sure what is a future home here right you you got over a thousand years before it can get here right amen but see we say we it was revealed remember nothing else the seals are revealed to the bride right but youd know for a shorty like the the for seal armag again and the fifth seals the fifth seal Jun you know that things we get into and The Sixth Seal be in the tri ation You' know that's not to us no but you see it seems have been so hard to try to express and to look at these and try to get people to realize what's taking place right but just get to a point you don't have to have all the background the the uh you know just leave it and just say well let Lord just help me to understand what that old guy's trying to say cuz he's been at it a long time right and I guess he's got so SE that's all he can do is just talk about the seals and the opening of the word and the revealing of Jesus Christ you know and so it is forgive me if all I can do is like John is just say love everybody you know and leave it alone and let me be that way but see the book has got to be completed yes that's right before he can take the book yes and if we are part of the book amen as we tried to emphasize the of the Prophet saying then is redemption over see if you're believing for your children for your grandchildren your husband your wife you know Etc you sure wouldn't want me to come out here and tell it's over with right you know wouldn't that be something wouldn't we all be happy that's stupid boy bless God God tells me something I just go tell you God told me something years ago and you've heard me say it that I could do something right here at this church anytime I got ready and for 20 years I haven't got ready yet you don't understand when God tells you something God tell me to do I just going to do it yeah that could wind up being like the Old Testament prophets were too right brother R said what about knowing this I'm according him we said trying to get it to the people see an Old Testament Prophet just go out and said that's it for go back to the Wilderness but your Prophet had to stay here with us and grind it out that's right and try to get us to see it knowing and just like when he come to the seventh seal he said it's gone from you that's before he even preached the seventh seal that's only the the questions and aners that he knew it was gone from the people now that's his words right amen see some people say well I don't know where he said well go read the book yeah I try to give you the page numbers and the things of it go read amen I ain't got time to read a few book just find one quote now you got enough time to be Sisty and ncy about all the rest of it yeah but listen Church listen to what I'm talking about this Bible as we covered this morning there's two parts to it right one part is The Book of Life the L book of life that your name was put there before the foundation of the world or it never will be put there the other part is the letters of these pages that tells of the lives that you and I are living upon Earth amen right so it's two parts to one book right all right see then this has to be completed all right before you can seal it up right and I was trying to illustrate with the the people of Israel going into captivity you know and their doings and and and they would seal up those things in their Earthly vessel and hide them well how would you like it if we run out of time of getting in there and brother Gary there was only a third of what you really supposed to get was wrote down on a piece of paper the rest of it was in your pocket cuz you hadn't got to you know to give it to him yet so when you come back you only going to get that third right y see that's not the way it is God is waiting for it to be sealed up amen and he's waiting it to be finished before it can be sealed amen now you said well if that's true then Brother D what about 144,000 that's not sealed up until they come here and live right that's right but we're not concerned with them right we're concerned with the Gentile dispensation right but it's made known to us what would take place right the opening of the seals was the revealing of Jesus Christ all the way through the Bible amen not to De section it in but all the way through the Bible that's why the Propet said it become a brand new book yeah that's right look at him he always preach that Jesus was almighty God right he'd always preached one true and living God Amen but then when the seals broke he preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed go in the Hebrew series and you got message after message of telling you about melz but then when the seals broke he preached the message who is present tense this mes see it become a new book to him am I heard a man that used to look gains for years ago and he'd been in the message about two months probably hadn't even never finished the seal book might not have read any of it but he said boy them seals broke brand new book how many of you even ever read the book all right how many of you ever even read the SE book right amen how many times have you read it right amen many times have you read the Bible let's go we'll get through about five all you got to do change a video over yeah we change a video over and you just start no you know people out there in like wonder what in the world will brother Dale pay for uh a point where that you could go to a dayve Ramsey will I like to help people you know amen sure and that's just my way of saying hey I'll help you go to see what you can do about the money but you know one of these days I might come around and say Hey you owe me all that you say you know just joking all right it don't matter to me that's right I just always tried to help people amen that's why today I could be a multimillionaire if I give it all away but I've enjoyed giving it away that's right and I don't regret giving anybody right I've always told you I'd buy a millionaire a meal this is quick as I buy a poper and you say well that's silly no it's not cuz I just made that I just don't care right but listen when the book is totally finished of our dispensation of time right in us the Gentiles then this book can be revealed to Israel right that's right and if it's not completed and sealed up there won't be anything to go to Israel right they can't read the book come on folks their eyes are blinded the Bible says amen that's right until this day it says amen that their heart is sealed right away from God but said one day it will turn you see all Israel is not going to be turned that's right it's not the nation of Israel that's going to be saved only 144,000 going to come out of Israel to be saved right but you see they're waiting on you and I to get out of the way that's right but the main thing they're waiting on you and I is to finish this book right amen and the finish our part of the book so where as John was specially chosen we are specially chosen to finish this situation if that don't give you a thrill in your heart then there's something wrong with your heart just the best way to say it but we covered it this morning I'll give it back because reason I do this a lot folks forgive me is those on the internet don't see all you see right so I have to sometimes put back on so go ahead pull up number one brother Anderson and it's the same thing as this morning we were talking about but I want the people out there to see it number one which is prph 74 the evening messenger there you go this 1963 this is just a little bit prior to the opening of seals he's talking about we find out the church ages in Revelations 10 there is to be a trumpet Revelations Church ages and over in Revelation 10 there's to be a trumpet down and there was seven voices there you know uttered they were not permitted to write but it was sealed on the backside of the book The Seven Seals was on the backs side of the book after the book is written now when what's the book written if we are as I gave this morning part of the mystery the prophet said Christ a mystery then the book can't be complete until we're sealed in because I said everybody's dealing with opening of books why don't you deal first with seeing how it got sealed right it can only be seal after it's written right amen they don't not take a great big light bug turned up that ought to be sensible am you know all right and in doing it now when the life one comes in then he can take the book but what he do what does he do first he seals it up right why we read this morning the holy spirit is the seal amen right the Bible says you're sealed until the day of redemption amen when the last one receives the baptism of the Holy Spirit sealed into the body amen there is to come a headstone amen which is love and that's going to seal us all in together then when we're sealed in it'll be a short Ministry yeah your Prophet said they would right after the door of the Gentile church is closed I will ano a church or God will ano a church that he doing one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 said he's doing it now why cuz he's sealing Us in the body of Christ now but one day he'll seal Us in by the holy spirit amen did not the prophet say to break a seal is to lose a Ministry amen right all right see we need these things according to the Bible and according to what we've read and proved this morning the book must be completed before it's sealed right all right now if you don't believe that one then you go back and you come down and we will just read verse one I mean verse 8 of chapter 5 and when he had taken the book The Four 20 Elders they fell down to worship right he couldn't take the book until it was completed so he's waiting on you amen that's right he's waiting on I to find that place Y and then he can move on the scene what do you mean he been years over okay sorry when Redemption is over the lamb can take the book break the seals and redeem every name that is in that book amen you remember the book we're talking about this morning that's the book of names yes right only names are written on the Lance Book of Life right but the book of life is a record of your natural life right all right and number two go ahead brother Anderson just bringing these back to you this is in the breach he said this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book until the day of redemption amen the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book we gave you from Christ The Mystery of God revealed where brother Brandon said that she's part of the mystery remember this morning it's on your notes there go on the screen for the others see then you and I is I was trying to wind down this morning you and I must become the word right not just talk about it right and it's not that we are to just give birth to the word remember Mary gave birth to the word right amen but your Prophet said see Mary is not the seed right he wouldn't saying she wouldn't have got right that's right he said so is it with Luther Wesley and Pentecost am he said they were carriers right why because none of those stages of the wheat little don't look like original right then the stock or the corn or whatever it don't look like the original you know what it looks like the original it's not even when you can take the corn and eat it green remember expl when you take that corn and you can take that corn and shook it off and put it in the ground and it'll grow now you know you don't put it in the ground until it gets really good and dry because it's going to rot all right going to rot on you and that's what most people have done so they come up with all these doctrines trying to make a Rapture take place and I'm not throwing off on never I never can you say that brother Dale has showed off on anybody for being in eror right because without the grace of God we would be the same right amen I don't care how goody goody you think you are right you're not Beyond Satan we were talking about that last night you know that that Gabriel couldn't even handle the devil when he was trying to come to Daniel right 21 days yeah the Bible says but he said Christ came to his Aid we see the devil couldn't handle Christ you know Michael amen he just couldn't handle him why because Michael was God Amen Gabriel was an angel remember right yes the devil was the anointed Sheriff that Stood Beside the Lord top Angel y that's that's right that's why Gabriel couldn't handle him right but Michael was God Amen Christ they could step on on the scene I want Michael on my side I love that song in Jamaica you know Michael on your side they sing it a lot huh but now think about it see then you and I must become the message amen the prophet said and I didn't bring some of these and just bringing it from the head but he said on birth pain he said I believe it's the right one where he said that the bride must give birth to Malachi 4 right brother R said we got to vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 now I'm quoting him right you mean brother Dale you think we got to vindicate God vindicate that through the prophet now he was the one that said we had to right he didn't say I done it all that's right he said there's something for you to do yeah that's right you know what vindicate means to establish something in to an order that cannot be questioned is that Vindicated can we actually say that we're sealed into that message enough until they can't be programers right well that's what a lot of people was doing you said oh no not doing that well they already they leaving this message and going back to the world going back to denominations and everything else right and the worst part of it is most of them are staying in the message already deprogrammed cuz they bring in so much false Doctrine amen all right but that's got to be here there must need be heres among you that they that are approved may be made manifest it's beneficial that somebody cross you that's right it'll make you think that's true it'll make you study that's right you I like what brother George Canada told a man one time something that was in the Bible and I think it water baptism not certain but anyhow he told a man he said go read the book and find it show me different the old man come back and he said did you find anything in there contary he said no but I found a lot of other good things so at least that's a good point you know we ought to be able to find some good things somewhere right all right so then when this book is completed you and I think finished then God can take not us over there physically no right but he can go over there and tell through two prophets that there was a bride in the Gentile dispensation amen and they took the word and they held the word and is it spoken word Original Seed he told Abraham he said you held that seed or maybe it was S I forgot which way brother stes it but said you held that seed in long enough right amen it's time for birth that's right amen we've talked about the message long enough that's right amen it's time to walk that's right Amen in the word see then after the Rapture of the church after the Rapture of the church now God won't take the see we got you got to get out of here before you go to Israel amen right right and see then when we get out of here he can go there but what's he going to take he going to take the Bible right right how many is them two prophets going to come up with a new version good news for Modern Man or are they going to take this Bible y where are they going to get their message from amen well they'll just get it fresh from God and bless God and go out did Brother brandom get it where did he get it out of the book right amen that's right come on those two prophets will take this Bible and they'll go to Israel and they'll say according to this book you turned down your right of sunship right and rejected Jesus Christ now you are in the tribulation because of that that's right and you must give your life that's right for this message would you'll be put there in a position of being Unix to the bride servants for the bride y you'll get to be close to her you can see her but you won't be part of it isn't it odd in her story that a man named Joseph one time was sold by his brothers right right right what put him into slavery yeah because he had already made them mad at him for telling that they were going to have to bow down before him that even his mother and father now I don't remember where his mother was still living but his father was I know but he was s down to Egypt you remember the story and while he was in Egypt and his brothers out there wandering around y he was given a gentile bride right amen from that Gentile bride he would come forth you know with her now when he begins to reveal himself to his brothers remember M the bride went over into the temple somewhere or the place or what you going to call it she wasn't there y she was removed from being with him yeah all right now I'm trying to get you to this holy story okay so the brothers come and they they go through the whole thing of all of knowing and don't know him and then they finally get to wind up to kny him and little Benjamin is there and brought around and said there's your typ of 144,000 right amen cuz see the other brothers just represented Israel right right right he said a little Benjamin said that's top you 144,000 all right but see his brothers came the wife was still in the Away From Him He makes himself known to his brothers but you know what I'll bet you the next meal they ate I know who was steing for side of Joseph he was very proud of that little wife sure don't you think the next time they ate together it wasn't just Israel even though his daddy was there he loved his daddy and he loved little Benjamin but he led that wife she was a part of him right all right and being a part of him there she set right with him we know that Pharaoh was in charge cuz the father was always in charge right not trinary in but Joseph was second in command as we call it and there said his wife beside of him Y and Israel could see his wife he was very proud okay but it wasn't that she was off somewhere else and flirting around and flopping around and doing right she was his wife y see then he can make himself known to his brothers but you know even though he would Pi Benjamin out of it as a great honor Benjamin and Joseph you remember the only two that was of the sons of whoel retel okay but he he was proud of his wife mm he he wanted them to see his wife y he thought more of his wife than he thought of his brothers he thought more of his wife than he did Joseph I mean excuse Benjamin that would be the honor of his heart he thought more of his wife than he did his father never left his wife went to his father right you can Bank on that that's why I said you better believe the first big banquet they had she was sitting right there with him there's a lot to the story going on through there but I just want to get that point in your mind and if you watch that story you saw exactly what I ended up saying this morning but this book that we are is completed yep sealed up by the Holy Spirit then he can take this Bible and go to Israel through two prophets and tell them the whole story of Joseph and how they missed it that's right that's right and why they would not be able to sit beside him amen even his daddy could not take the place of his wife right because even in the visions and things it wasn't his wife he never saw his wife bowing before him but he even saw his mother his father and all of his Brethren had to Bow before him his wife never bowed she didn't have to you there's a little bride when we become the word amen we we thought we was the word when we become the revealed word amen that's right we're not the word called we read it off the page right that's right it's when we can live it in reality right then something can take place that's right see he wanted his father and his brothers to see his wife Lord willing Tuesday 54 years that's my wife I love you I love my family but a man asked me one day he said you've heard me tell it said if you had to make a decision between your family dying or your wife dying said what would you do I said my family be gone my wife is part of me he said I wouldn't do that and it proved but still that's how close we are as one right all right he's very proud of his little bride he wants to show her brother R said just for a moment he'll show his bride to the world now that's a d right quote Amen brother not going to show it out here that the whole world is going to look up and see it no no no no those a rain right all Egypt never saw this what was going on only the ones that were chosen to be around when the wife was introduced that's right so you see the story yes M when we become the word yes God will have something to take to Israel right amen right and brother brandom I'll give it to you over and over and over where he says page 8 or paragraph 80 the Revelation chapter 5 I think that was what numberers that should be number four brother but it may not be MH right all right number four pull it up we've seen this one over and over and over but let's read one more time Revelation 5 1961 now he's preparing for the opening of those Seven Seals of redemption amen see that's what the fifth chapter is now take it out and say it's not important say it's out of order well we just bypass that we we don't need to know that brother mo one time we were talking to a brother he said I preached 72 hours on the Statue of perfect man brother said I ain't got 72 hours to listen to that he did so you another brother said what do you mean I preached it in an hour and a half yeah I'm not joking that happen but look see look the opening of those seven sealed red that's what the fifth chapter is that's the reason I kind of read it and then just take it from there and talk on it and give the other parts of the scripture is because it isn't verse by verse something that's happening it's not that it's preparing for something to happen if you get the preparation then youve just you're ready for it then it's all by faith y now how many times have we read that quote it's not a verse by verse but we must read it verse by verse he was reading it verse by verse expressing it what does he mean he wasn't looking down through time right when this happens a lamb had done walked out it had seven horns and seven eyes verse seven the lamb had done walked out the emphasis of chapter 5 is what you see next a preparation right that's going to take place see everything must be prepared then in Revelations 5 around said it's the scene y of preparing for the opening yep John was told chosen to see that event I believe you and I are chosen to see it today right amen but we must be qualified yes right to be able to see the opening of the book yes the prophet opened it that's good you just made in God because brother brandom didn't open the seals that's right the lamb my Bible says and my Prophet said the lamb is the one that could break the seals and open the book that's right run around couldn't do it that's right see how easily you make him God that's right and don't know it that's right you know that a major point if you want to discuss some of these things after service with me I'll be glad to but I don't just Yaky Yak on tape I don't time about major points of a lot of these doctrines is proven that brother brandham is almighty God that's their point right you say but brother Dale the seals opened in 63 that was only in Revelation form yeah the six seal didn't break in 63 did it no the tribulation never said in in 63 did it so it was Revelation to the prophet that's right but he was the only one that it was revealed to in its fullness I'm sorry he said it's G from you and there's no way for you to know it I didn't make that statement he did all right see John saw these things John saw it open John brother said even Daniel heard the Thunders but did he know what you were John heard the Thunders but was forbidden to ride right Amen brother R made a statement that you got to clarify real good go to number five he's taken from the first seal 1963 through1 18 you talking about when it thundered remember a loud clap clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of God we were talking about last night in the Bible study and I've mentioned it to you before that they're arguing over whether brother random was out there when that Ain where the light went up these things happen and all of that you know but just go ask those Brothers those Brothers heard a thunder brother brandom Heard a Voice told him to go back to Jeffersonville he'd be told him what to do what he said right those Brothers heard a loud blast right y but they never saw the Angels Above the prophet didn't do in the Bible it thundered when Jesus was there a loud clap of Thunder is the voice of God he said brother what are the Thunders it's the voice of God right speaking to you by Revelation that's right of what is re sealed in the book simple isn't it that's a 1972 quote okay from blooded Dale all right they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it for it was revealed to him it was a thunder and notice the first seal opened the first seal when it was open in the symbol form it thundered now we'll get to that in Revelation 6 1 where it says that it thundered and emphasize more on it but now look what he says now what about when it's opened in its reality form when it opened to the prophet it opened with a loud blast of thunder right what about it when it went finally winds up being there right if you've been listening to what I've tried to preach and some of you have you'll remember that back into the early 70s that I was trying my best to get you to see that the actual reality or the situations or what is under the seals is to Israel right yes we get the Revelation right amen by way of the prophet's message right amen we're not there when the six seal opens that's at least one to show for sealers Armageddon we're not there when those things are to take place we surely better hope we're not all right the seals then will be open to Israel after we leave right amen right can't be open to them now their mind's closed their eyes are blacking the Bible says right right you can't have him dealing with both this Gentile and Jew at the same time right amen it's when we leave out of here then God's going to Israel and remove from their eyes yes the blindness that has been placed there that's right and then they can see only after we leave cuz only after we leave do you have something that can go like right that's why I asked this morning that's a seriousness of it I'm don't play games I'm serious right could God take what you have in Revelation and send you to Israel right boy wouldn't it be something for a lot of the preachers in this message to go to Israel that's right well them Jews would laugh you off the street you remember that Jew that talked to brother randam yeah you talking about the guy that was healed that Jew said you can't cut cut God in three pieces and give him to a Jew he said they'll tell tell you exactly where that Trinity come from and show you exactly the books that's where it's at he said they know it where it came from right boy wouldn't it be something to go over there to Israel and you start up burn you tell that old Jew you know that old priest standing there and you say you got two Souls I don't think you'd have enough time for us you know like that you no but you see as I was saying this morning look how dangerous it would have been you remember on the video come on is it 20th century Prophet I don't think it's deep called Deep it's 20 Century Prophet they were planning on him they met with him in the video and they planned for him to go to Israel he packed up and was going to Israel he got over to CYO Egypt and it was and God told him to go he changed and went down through and come out another way didn't go to Israel around never did go to Israel but you see look how dangerous it would have been that je knows that word but he's also commanded to believe the prophets and the Bible says when a prophet is Vindicated ated right you hear him right amen right right amen right look how dangerous it would have been for brother random to walk up there and say your name is so and so your come up here and God don't heal you I'm a false prophet what do you think them Jews would have been doing amen but you see God wouldn't let him go he said okay you missionar prr go ahead go to if you want to a going listen to you you know that this message has been delivered in Israel you know this message there is a church or two I know there's one and I'd already heard of one before this one the last one that the brother even came here but there's churches in Israel of this message and you know that they're on the internet waves in Israel do you know that that um brother Perry green actually had a thing set up and and and had a video made of it and showing and had brother Brandon's voice speaking about Israel and what was how they were and what they were to be this message is all over the world the Jews know about this and all it be saying is let's see the sign right of the Messiah cuz the Messiah they believe to be God cuz that's what he is they want to see that sign all right but what about it when those two witnesses go over there to tell them about the book that you and I have completed and made manifest then Israel will see the light it's only after we're gone that's right God don't deal with it like that see and it won't be as I st keep stating this cuz some people want to link you together they sure you say something and they want to link you together you know with some Doctrine I don't like that I told you about the man telling me that the two witnesses would be a gentile bride and a gentile prophet and I told him no it would not be right we would have to be two Jews that would go to Israel all that is like people call it great revelation it will be the word of God that will be made known to Israel amen you agree I would agree that in the Baptist wouldn't you I mean if you asked me that question I was in the Baptist you be the word of God revealed through witnesses to the Jew I wouldn't have know much about what talking about had that much sense all right all right so then it will be the word of God that will isra that will be made known to Israel the word of God of who you are and what you have become and that you've gone off the Earth in a Rapture amen all right now with all that in mind let's pull over go ahead pull up Revelations 5 you add it up want to go Revelation 58 I may have to take another message on this Wednesday but all right don't worry about it I'll be preaching on something anyway verse eight and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and V going to V full of ERS which are the priers of the Saints now over in Revelation 85 now if I miss that I believe that's right it tells you about the the prayers of the Saints it tells you what that is you know the prayers of the Saints the vs poured out that's why the tribulation sets in is because you are gone and there's no one to try to intercede with God he said but there'd be a lot of good people left right there was a lot of good people down in Sodom but there was only one man that could deal with God and say God if I find 50 will you sp that's right yes Lord if I find 40 you know what he got it down to about 10 or five didn't he and they wouldn't five of them out there see what causes the tribulation to take place is it's the wrath of God poured out upon the Earth because there's no more prior of the Saints for intercession right he said no we're not cath no we're not Catholic but the prayers you're making for your families are the ones that God is hearing to bring them in amen once that's gone there's no more prayers so that means exactly the prayers of the Saints yes you'll find later I believe it's 8:5 that they're poured out and look and they sang a new song M then they AR worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof the book still s yeah come on you want to read the book is still sealed at that period of time why because it had to be sealed up before it could be sealed amen for thou are slain and H has redeemed us to God by th blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and Nation okay now they asked brother Brandon go ahead with that quote at number six number six they ask brother Brandon about Revelations 5 was that the science his answer was no yep that is not the redeem Revelations 5 singing when the lamb takes a book out of are these the raptured Saints no h sure Revelation 6 5 and9 not 6 he's jumping over but it's fth chapter 8th verse and then going down to nine and on if you notice these are not the Saints he has never claimed his property yet this is not the Saints if you'll notice they're the elders and the Beast and they seem it is not the bride so he goes to the bottom and says Thou Hast redeemed us and made us priests and Kings he reads the scripture himself y much that's the Heavenly group not yet the redeemed and he read the scriptures right which are the priers of the Saints and they sang a new song Why would brother Brandon say that was not the bride why would he say that do you know why he said that I don't mean wrong wrong I mean right right I don't mean smart ethically do you know why he said that you said what going on down to the other but let's deal with this how come he said that I told you at the end of the service this morning had he said that was the the bride he would have been exactly right but when he said it wasn't the bride you said well that don't mean nothing to me why did he say it what was it that was making it a mystery that's what I titled this part of the message today the mystery what was the mysterious part that was there that would cause him to say that he was saying it because of his own teaching that's quiet them old Wheels is a turny Ain some of them are grinding into a halt and squeaking and old brains are eroding and I like that either that or you sleep and I don't see anybody at this time that is that so all right but why would a prophet say right when he's done went through chapter 4 Y and he already has said that the Rapture comes in chapter 4 verse1 John typed the Rapture Y how many messages back to that that okay you see what I've been doing digging it in digging it in digging it in digging it in CU I realize what do they say that you only retain 5% of what you hear that's why a movie you know I told you the other day what they do in these movies now you notice it goes in the scene and all you kick off over here something exciting happening and then they'll jump back to here CU they've proven that if you keep running that channel and they keep that scene going going and N Scurry home like that that you just get totally nonchalant so they proved that there you go change it off to another scene keep it going fast so that way the Mind clicks back I've been putting it in for a long time waiting for a time to say what I want to say and it's 20 minutes till for so we be I'm not jimy that's long so you going not beay with me today okay amen sorry good but you know brother Brandon why are you saying that that is not the bride when you've already said the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 yeah why would you say that well he was just tired and he was weary and when cuz you see brother R was juggling between brother R's mind was juggling between Earthly events and Heavenly events sure and he says this is not the bride see because this is what he always taught right he always taught that the bride goes up going on number seven this is what your Prophet is taught and a lot of people thinks wonder why brother Dale would would this deal on these thing so much paragraph 24 now Revelations the first three chapters deals with the church then the church disappears and we see it no more until the end time from Revelation 1 to3 is the church Revelations 4-9 is Israel a nation and 19 to 22 is both of them together the things right okay brother randam had taught this before the opening of the seals go to the next one number eight Revelations 4 part 1 oh and notice John being taken up immediately after the church AG for the top of the raptured church immediately after the church age is over this lady will see an age then comes the Rapture the church goes up like John did into the presence of God oh my we that just winds my soul around caught up in the Rapture the church and it said this place the Book of Revelation was written to see at the end of the church age all right now he's taught these things he's taught that the church goes up right so he's looking at this group of people and realizes the seals ain't broke yet right come on did we read that in Revelations 5 he takes the book and gets ready to opening of the seal the opening of the seals in chapter 6 right right yeah so brother brother R's mind is dealing with this is Israel you said well how do you know well that's what he says 4:19 is Israel from 4 to 19 right is Israel after the Rapture of the church and he's teaching it as bringing it down the line of what's to come next right we go up right we go up 41 Yep this is 58 nine he's thinking that's Israel cuz if it's not the Saints who else could it be that's right come on who else could it be if it's not the bride there's only two Redemptive forms to be made in the Book of Revelation yes the others is given eternal life at the white Throne Etc and things that's not Redemptive forms that's right the only two Redemptive forms in the Book of Revelation is the Bride of Jesus Christ and the 144,000 that's true MH because 144,000 receive eternal life they right here amen all right that don't make them bride that's right amen but you see because of what he Tau right he was saying this was Israel right now if that was Israel in Revelations 5 or is Israel then were we come on wake up where are we oh we the we the we the throne we the book we yeah because of that being Revelation 5 being us but if that's Israel you just blowed your whole Plan of Redemption far the bride and for Israel and you cannot find the bride in heaven you would have to jump over to the 19th Chapter and come writing back right no if he' left it there what would that have been total wrong Doctrine well the Holy Spirit didn't do that it stopped him right we'll get to that in a second but just to go on to show you how much he believe this that we go up and then the seals are broke to Israel yeah go on to number nine let's read a few of these God being misunderstood 61 this is still before the SE and then remember if if the Lord willing in next Sunday I want to do my best by the grace of God to explain the 70 weeks of Daniel as I said this morning it's a great scripture and it's not so much to speak on but to place it where it belongs to make it fit with the rest of the Bible right got a place at 70 weeks D and we have started with Revelations 1 got over in the sixth chapter and of course we get in now to the seven seal like seals and those seals will run from the sixth last part of the sixth chapter unto the 19th Chapter inclusive so it would take a long time now I could take say seven nights and run the Seven Seals open them up but if you do it that way then the people will miss the great part back here that fields in this yes okay when the church goes up read in between that's the last part of the church part excuse last of the church until she comes with her Lord as bride and remember excuse her Lord as bride bridegroom and in the 19th Chapter during this time between what 41 we'll read that again during this time it's dealing with Israel and to get to 70 weeks of Daniel in now it sets the picture for the coming open first F now I didn't give you this one but can you pull that one up now brother Anderson of the paragraph 71 gabel's instruction to Daniel I think he's going let him down sometime they got to hunt for him okay look what he says in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel read 1961 730 Revelation 61 to 1921 is connected with the 70 weeks 70 OD weeks therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain why these 70 of weeks because if it don't don't you miss those seals everybody knows all about the seals don't about said you it's Daniel you miss the trumpets you don't he hear them preach song you miss those vows you don't hear that preach song Those plagues don't hear that those three unclean Spirit like frog you don't hear that one those three woes the casting out of the red dragon the woman and the sun you miss it all if you don't because it takes place right here in this 70th week absolutely that's where it takes place so you can't understand the seals and the things I understand in Daniel 70 weeks how many times have I said that to you let continue on now with number nine make number nine got to read number nine no we didn't read them excuse me you read nine go to 10 excuse me okay look you all right y'all ahead of me that's good taking sides with Jesus still before the SE right which we realize in Revelations it's just one two three chapters to the church the church goes up in the fourth chapter it does not return anymore till the 19th Chapter that's after the tribulation period when God called out the Jews now here's where we got it ride something go listen higher higher listen seals will be dealing on earth right in time the bride is up in heaven so the bride is not seen on Earth after tell 4 right until the 19th Chapter when she rides back with him right but it doesn't say she can't be seen somewhere cuz in chapter five she's in heaven right oh you're dealing with two things Church goes up and does not return work to Earth right now going to Lev this is on the breach 1963 317 now then we're going to turn to the fifth chapter now this is not the Seven Seals it is the breach between the church ages and the Seven Seals okay now there is also a sixth chapter and there was a fourth chapter rather Revelation and in that it kind of reveals something that would take place after the church going up and the church goes up in the third chapter of Revelation see the last verses right and does not return until the 19th Chapter of Revelation therefore the church misses the tribulation right the Glorious thing go to the next this goes into the first seal 63 3:18 now the Holy Spirit and the Revelation and the re and Christ is the holy spirit is Christ in another form that's right notice it is a lamb that opened the book and the lamb is Christ Now read it and Christ is not seen anymore from then now what does he mean chapter one The Lamb is Christ opening the boat but remember when you leave out of here you're you're the Christ that's right that's right the bride not see anymore don't out here she not seen on Earth no more till 19 see you're the Christ he said oh that's too much okay you don't remember what we was reading this morning then that the bride of Christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily but he is seen in the Book of Revelation the 19th Chapter coming on the White Horse you want to turn there and read it go ahead to the next one paragraph 287 verse Seal and notice Christ is not seen anymore see from the time there when he is on a white horse so if this guy is riding a white horse he's on an impersonator he's going on in but he's not seen anymore from there okay going on to the next this is taken from the fifth seal but the reason that he reveals that I as I understand that is because the mystery the book of redemption as far as the Antichrist being real revealed and the at the same time the church is gone and these these things don't even happen in the church age at all that's right they're there away from the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time Jus not down here right for one to go up not down here Israel's down here getting the the seals the persecution the trial we're gone Church goes up the fourth chapter of Revelation does not return until it comes back with him and with his King see ly remember this morning come back with the King not a lamb we don't ride back in 19 with a lamb we ride back with the King we're husband and wife right all right cuz her wife bride has made herself ready these seals here are revealing has been what is what will be and all it's revealing the SE let's go to the next I like about two more and I'll bit through this is taken from the Feast of the trumpets the first preached in 64 719 after the seal was preached the first three chapters of the Book of Revelation revealed all the happenings unto the church then from the third chapter into the 19th Chapter Revelation there is no more scene of the church he's talking about bride right not Church bride the church goes up at the fourth chapter of Revelation and returns back at the 19th Chapter of Revelation the bride and groom together coming to the Earth y all right now go ahead and put up number 16 because that is the one where he says it's the finish of what I started a while ago coming down and where they asked him the question and he comes back and he says there's something wrong there something wrong that's all that's just all there is to it there's something WR happens see the Holy Spirit started correcting him but he didn't know what it was right there's something that went wrong somewhere everybody feeling all right there's no there's no sickness or or nothing a man in the congregation requests that brother Brown read Revelations 59 again let's see Revelation where was it brother oh oh oh question the question I was answering now let's see see all right so he gets to Revelations 5 and he reads it Y and he sees that they sang a new song right it was worthy to take the book and thou Hast redeemed us to God right right remember what he said the first part of it this is not the redeemed this is not the Saints the Holy Spirit says it is the Saints in heaven this is not an Earthly thing it's in heaven that's right what do you think about that oh the presence of the holy spirit is here what is he wouldn't let him answer that you read on down he wouldn't let him answer he goes on down he says that these are the redeemed y you got the quote they got it on the internet they can read it now let me preach a second see you can read it cuz I got to get through see if brother Brandon would have left that he was referring to Revelations 5 as being Israel who else would have been referring to it as being right but when he was corrected he said no that is the bride there we are in glory the bride of Christ in glory with him amen but just remember if he said that was Israel and left it you would have had an incomplete book come on you may not see the danger of what it was the danger there was just as much danger when he said the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit right yep he would have been glorifying Satan yep for saying that now he would be making Israel the bride shedding in glory in chapter 5 and you and I would have no place the holy spirit says that ain't right he rereads it and he said I was wrong see I was wrong about said that is the bride she's in glory amen amen right now you got a book to go to Israel yeah cuz Israel ain't seen until you get over to the sixth chapter come on Israel's not in the fifth chapter right the bride I'll get on it Wednesday and just back up enough and preach it because to show you what they doing cuz they say we're Kings we're priests amen under almighty God sure you see how far he would have missed it he would have been making that yep Israel and he made her the bride so you can't do that no she'll never come back to be bride she comes back to be servant that's right so now you have the Plan of Redemption it goes all the way through and you have what I've tried to prove to you for many many years the seals are to Israel right that's right so when the seals start breaking in Revelation 61 it's not breaking in heaven right it's breaking on earth right right through two prophets but brother Dale you go all the way through and show that brother R was talking about that we're in the seals we're in the revelation of the seals right right we're not in the reality of the seals that's right they ask him one sensible question and I say that in stating it factly he said don't give me questions on anything but on these seals he preach six right and he said give me questions on the seals one question the question was does brother brandom do this Thessalonians D the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God that fulfill the first seal he said yes yes right the rest of it is should they wear peny Hool should he wear this how should he be baptized why does it say father son Holy Ghost no wonder he said it's gone from me right sir he read the questions yep right right remember wait emphasizing that you read the questions and there was no questions related to the seals except one he said they're not getting it right the Lord said yep they ain't supposed to right I said one day it'll be R yes sir amen you see you may not understand the serious and I keep stating if that is Israel in Revelations 5 you know 144,000 whatever then where are we right right and where is she book right amen cuz Israel's book ain't wrote yet come on they got to live it right we get the Revelation they get the realities they get to tribulation they get to man of sin y they get all of that but we see where the man of sin started and come all the way down until we see him with Israel and then we see him destroyed amen that's right amen yeah we see by Revelation amen they by reality amen let's Stand Together goad and get ready for the communion it's already to be a little late f not much problem it's just about 3 minutes after 4 we'll be done before 5 sorry about that you get hungry and chew on your fingernails while the way does the thing and need can eat later I'm sorry I just I want to get done real hurry all right but you seen where I got to it opened up it's opened up now I can go through the whole book of Revelation right so we can just start all evening and stay here if you want to well let's read the scripture Paul said in the 11th chapter verse 23 of First Corinthians for I re of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same man also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament and my blood this do ye as of as you drink it and remember rembrance of me where as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily you'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation rest will I said in order when I come let's just take a moment of solid pray good remember I forgot uh I got a inspection coming up tomorrow one of my houses in and I remember she got an inspection is any anybody heard anything from from Olivia I figured they would have called in Brother Anderson they they called in or anything nothing has been call in we'll let you know as quick as we can find outside but as we're praying remember this and Terrence because we're to pray one for the other and remember this this that he's asking about a house that inspection that you know where he can keep on renting and things and then remember a little Olivia and just pray one for the other the Lord we bless right let's just pray silently before the Lord just bless each one Lord in your loving grace we thank you we love you and we commit everything into your hands make us worthy to be able to partake of this communion this day because we're not worthy in ourselves but you can make us worthy we just have your way forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it was made today for this one purpose and that is here for us to protect this afternoon we ask you to just help us to remember what this means this is not your body it is not Lord flesh it is only a symbol yes but in this symbol there's wonderful Pleasures placed forth in your word we ask you to sanctify the partakers sanctify the bread in Jesus name I hope you'll go home and consider today and see that the Book of Revelation that is in perfect order amen yes sir but if it had have been that that was Israel that your Prophet thought it was it was throw out the continuity right of the entire Bible y that's right but yet it's in perfect order now there is something to happen to Israel they have a book that can go to them Y and be revealed and made known to them y then they can have their glorious time cuz they're taken up with the 144,000 is taken up evidently with the two witnesses because they have a Rapture too you know and then it'll go on into other things as we'll go through and cover don't know what details of what we'll go into I will just leave it a lot upon the basis of you saying brother Dale would you explain this if you'll put your questions in we will attempt to to tie together what we're talking about in a relationship to what questions you would be having cuz I want you to have the answer to the questions not that for me but we can find them you know what I've always seen it ain't that we got all the answers but we
