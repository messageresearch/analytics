people here father your bride and the bride around the world father I pray that you'd bless them today be with the ones Lord that are sin sick father we we send the call out Lord for those to come back to you Lord I pray that you'd grant that in Jesus name amen I was thinking yesterday man what would it be get everybody all back together again Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it to the seven churches I'm not going to read them you know where they are we're now in the speaking of the Philadelphian Church age heading toward the layout of sin and I turned to see the voice that spake with me I remember John heard a voice that sounded like a trumpet now listen you and I have had the trumpet sound in this day we should have heard the voice specific to me and you that's what we're going to get into Leia specific to me and you it's okay to listen to Luther it's okay to listen to Wesley which we can't listen to them you understand what I mean but we can read their writings and the things that happen like we're talking about now but unless we hear the voice of God for our day then we're behind and God's never behind he's always moving forward all right and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot G about the paps with a golden girdle or read a couple of scriptures and he can be seated Revelations 3:7 to the angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things say he that is Holy he that is true we're going to talk about that today he that ha the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man open this you may be seated we'll read the rest of it a little bit later but as we were talking Wednesday night we've come to a we've come to a place now that we're getting closer to the history that you and I can understand everybody with me I mean we're coming down here to where we're looking at at Luther and Wesley and we have seen them we know we see their writings their writings are in books I don't know if Columba has a writing or I know Paul did he wrote part of the Bible but irenius never had a um you know a library that we could go read but now we do have one for John Wesley and Martin Luther and the reason is that is because it's now the man anointing are the spiritual Information Age just as this is the natural Information Age all right and we've come to the place now to where you know you got everything on your on your arm now you got your Apple watches and all these different things that you can U that you can get your information off of where back then they had to listen to a sermon I think sometimes we get a little um lazy I guess maybe is well we don't have to listen to that if we fall asleep we'll just you know listen it to it tomorrow or or watch it online but they didn't have a chance to do that they had to hang on every word that Luther and Wesley said and even Pentecost even isza Street and different ones not until we got brother brandham not until we got to the 1947 1948 coming out of the war did they develop a thing called a recording device and that we could hear truly the voice of God for the end time so we are a privileged group of people but remember more is given more is required so more is given to us than any other age more is required but brother John we got an open book though we know the answer to the questions we have the things that as we're going to talk to a minute in a minute about an unfulfilled age this age is not an unfulfilled age Martin Luther's age was an unfulfilled age because he couldn't get everything correct like the prophet of God did in the end time thank God for this message of the hour and let me let me let you in on a little secret it doesn't matter to me who it came from it came through the man God wanted it to come through and no one else but listen to The Voice don't worry about the man listen to The Voice the the Bible says you listen to what the spirit says to the churches all right and we got it in tape and book form and I know that but listen so that God can talk to you not brother randam talk to you that's God's voice for the end time and when brother Bob stands here brother Aaron Brother Louise different Minister stands here that's the voice of God speaking to you in the end time and you're able to process it different than Martin Luther different than John Wesley because we have the true anointing or the eagle anointing or we have the truth totally we are a fulfill age we look pretty horrible now I don't say we the bride but it looks horrible out there but we the bride we're right on time we know what we're doing we know where we're at where we're at we know I was talking to brother Chris we were speaking about what he had went over for the weekend cuz we went back down to brother Barry's on thurs or brother Barry's on Thursday when he passed and it it's just a you can't I wish you could drill a hole in people's head and pour it in but you can't you've got to be a receptor you've got to be able to receive the message for your day and without the new birth you cannot receive the message of your day you can hear it you can try to act on it a little bit but you cannot be the message of the hour you have to be the message of the hour right everybody with me amen all right so we now we come to that church age that's Philadelphia it's in the man anointing remember as we were talking about Wednesday night a dominating female has always always took over the church and always destroyed the works of God or tried to destroy the works of God all right it is not for a female to speak our us Authority as Paul says cuz he knew the ruination of many people was a woman the ruin of Solomon was women the ruination of different ones even Samson was a woman there was a woman involved and we said before and dad spoke it many many years ago me all the wars that ever started and was ever fought was usually there was a woman tied up somewhere or involved in something going on well same thing with the church we can't let the church dominate us that's right hello somebody you can't let the church Church you can't let this message Church dominate you CU there's things in the message that are not of God false Doctrine is not of God it is not part of the headstone it is not part of the message of the hour oh it's people hanging around the camps that's why we've got to be precise and I love people like brother Mike and brother Chris they're precise in what they bring and they bring something with Clarity and if you didn't understand anything this weekend understand understand one thing it's close it ain't far off there's one or two little things that we're missing not missing but we're missing at that I believe when we get those things straightened up brother Bown said remember when we realize who we are yes and what we're doing here we're not com to just get we didn't come to get our good clothes on and come to church today and wonder what's going to happen that's right you got to make it happen you got to say Amen you got to say praise the Lord you got to be ready for the service individually we must be ready for the things that God's going to bring us if not we will absolutely miss it let's don't miss it let's get out of here with it so remember the opening of the seals we're going to get back to this when we get into brother Bam's Ministry but those seals opened in their natural form during the time of we know it's it's there's a natural and a spiritual point there was a white righteous Church listen that white righteous church is still here right Catholic church it's a white righteous church that began in that age and comes to this age all right the're red listen they're not killing they're they almost killed President Trump yesterday about three inches over and he wouldn't be here but you take that and you know what they'll use that I like what brother Mike said think about that deadly wound healed we might think it was a pope but we may be a little surprised where the Superman comes from but you take these ages and you bring them up and you see that each one was a loosing of a Ministry so there was a loosing of a white righteous church and it's still going on there was a loosing of red they were killing physically back there but remember brother R said you kill a man you kill his influence so you've killed him spiritually over here and Satan is killing us spiritually if we don't wreck wake up there's been a true Ministry loose though in every age to combat the fal and actually it went out first amen Satan is not an originator Satan is a pretender or he comes back behind God and tries to pervert so when that white horse rode out there was somebody standing there called a lion of the tribe of Judah one of the four Beast that said hey John come and see and what do he see what do he see you saw a white righteous church right out because it was a white righteous Church on on the earth at that time under Paul irenius and Martin different ones right then the fourth Church age Satan said I'm going to just start killing them I can't hardly get them all sometime spiritually so I'm going to just kill them physically so that second beast was the ox it was Labor they labored through that church age and it was red and power was given he was given a sword so now he's given a word to to deceive the People by all right so as we move on up the fifth and sixth Church age which will be the one we're talking about now the fifth and the sixth five would be Luther and and sixth would be Wesley that third Beast a man says come and see and then a black horse rode out and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand listen I want to tell you something about the message of the hour when you hear somebody preaching different things you better find the balance of the two there is a balance and I know people hate George Smith and you're going to see him Friday cuz he's coming he'll pull his ruler out and he'll lay her right here on the pull pit and he ain't trying to figure out whether the pull Pit's level or not he says we got to have balance in the message and that's true we got to have the balance of the message of the hour CU if you cater one way or the other you got to come back to zero to balance out so that's what we're doing now we're trying our best to to not bring a new sword we're not bringing a new word but let's sharpen what we have let's let that thing cut where it should cut so the fifth and sixth Ages which we're finished one now we're into the other one we see that fourth the third Beast was a man which is intelligent smart shrewd brother B says all right so we're going to start back just over because I want to come back to one thing I want to talk about that I missed with Martin Luther's age and he was regarded is the most influential figure in Christian history why he was like Moses like I said Wednesday night he actually literally he bed at a system that ruled everything in the world and he was actually in that system sir and he come out of that system and said they're wrong the 95 thesis and God had to protect him God had to keep him alive because they wanted to kill him the Catholic Church yeah the Catholic church if y'all don't understand the Catholic Church they have Jesuits and they have their own little FBI and come on people we ain't stupid but now he come out with a with a saying of the just shall live by faith as we were covering Wednesday night you've got to see that you have by faith been Justified not because you come to not I've got 10 year brother been here 45 years I don't mean nothing to God remember God's Not A Time creature God's not going to ever ask you how long did it take you to become a Christian he knows how long cuz he's in eternity standing there waiting on you to come to him all right but no man is justified by the law now remember the law was what dos and don'ts we read all that you do this you die you do this you live you do this you die all right then Grace had to come in because the just shall live by faith or by grace are you saved through faith all right so it's the grace of God that did it but remember there's one thing we're going to cover right here in just a second they were reformers they could not bring everything together Martin Luther had a good message John Wesley had a wonderful message and many people were saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost during their powerful powerful Holy Ghost message but it didn't perfect the people to the place God wants them perfected to right God requires Perfection be therefore perfect now he didn't say be therefore fulfilled he said be therefore perfect so it was a little green shoes and God was so happy with that even the two cuz remember he said I will restore he had he had planted that seed in the ground there after NAA in the Dark Ages and then God was happy to see those two shoots pop up he was happy with Martin Luther even all Martin Luther's fallacies he was happy with that because he was doing something God told him to do how we going to be happy do what God told us to do that's right well I don't think stop right there take that eye part out that's right you're you're in trouble when you say I think or I it ain't what we think it's what God Said So the two shoots that signified the truth was coming back now remember the truth wasn't there totally the truth was coming back CU remember God is a dispensationalist God does things in what progression be you know why he does that for me and you he's already perfect he's already he don't need that he but we do he knew we were humans he knew that we would come under an education system where we would start kindergarten and go all the way to to wherever you want to go into your into your education he knew we'd need that so he he took the word of God and he put it in the same way doesn't the Bible tell us that the godhead can be seen can be understood by the things we what see or understand the things we understand understand I can see how God's one but have many manifestations I'm one there's not two or three in me I'm one but they have many manifestation but the world don't even see that they say nope there's three so the truth was coming back as it was known at Pentecost was the doctrine of justification look salvation by grace apart from works as we were talking Wednesday night but remember our justification gets a start Ed into getting born again their justification their requirement was was to believe that the just shall live by faith not by Penance that was a listen that was a revelation we can call it baby form all we want to it was the fullness for them at the time amen we can call it whatever we want to but that was the power of God in the people to cleanse them save them sanctify them and actually give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like you you got but remember God moves on he requires Perfection he Winks at the ignorance of the people and then he moves forward because he knows we're human beings but he does set another person in place called John Wesley so he's moving on he's moving on up John Wesley takes s takes justification puts it with sanctification and said that's it well then God moves on God says no you got to go to the gifts you got to go get receive the Holy Ghost and then you got to go on to what the word of God being brought back in power which will get to a little bit later on but salvation by grace apart from Works he will ever forever be known as the instrument in the hand of God now watch instrument in the hand of God who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith now it's been called period of reformation so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would Paul and listen now that's Alpha but as was Omega William brandham restoring the full word by the full word was here went the ground the middle age now it's coming back here you and I are sitting under the full word of God and we'll get to that this afternoon I'll read it to you where brother R talks about how that Hagar and Sarah and Mary all typed of different things and we'll get into it this afternoon because remember Mary was not the seed Mary was a carrier of the seed Mary Tau Pentecost is what we're getting into now not saying they weren't true but she didn't have the seed she had to be given seed yes that's why I want to talk to that if y'all catch what brother Mike ALK said the other day you'll you'll understand about that about people talking about the seed he talks about the seed but he said but you weren't Eternal see there was nothing Eternal in you you come to that but that seed has always been Eternal the mind of God's always been Eternal he can't change his mind so yes there is representation for you at your birth when you were born God knew you'd come to this age he knew you'd want the Holy Ghost and he had it there for you he didn't give it to you when you were a baby come on Mary did not have seed in her when she was born she had to receive seed Sarah had to receive seed you sisters had to receive seed to have children you didn't come with all that and who are we we're the bride right we're the bride we have to receive seed and then all that life comes together and then that happens that there's a blossoming but God knew that before the foundation of the world had it already ready for you but it didn't make you Eternal at your birth at your sorry your natural birth it did at your spiritual birth but not at your natural birth they can say all these things about laying dormant I eternal life to me is not dormant so you either got it or you don't that's right it's just to me it's cut and dry either gu or you don't and the Bible says you don't the Bible says you got to be born again what being born again the seed of God coming into your soul and quickening yeah quickening the word that you hold in your heart you did not get born again out in the backside of a desert Somewhere listening to nobody but your brain I'll promise you you ain't Born Again seed life has to come through the body seed life has to come through the body somebody has to talk to you and expound to you why did the people at at Corinth didn't re receive the Holy Ghost they were preaching Jesus Christ read your book of Acts but it took somebody like Paul or Peter to come with the quickening power come on somebody that's why we need the quickening power in our services the quickening power to Quicken those that are not born again right and it comes from a message it comes from this the seed life has to come through the body yes sir I'll get off of that but it's the truth anyhow listen the word of God is always right we can't interpret it different we can take quotes just like I was um um kind of the other day studying a little bit on Daniel 70 weeks again and I talked to brother Claude the other day and we were we were kind of chuckling about it but you know people can take quotes and they they'll take quotes and throw the Bible away you can't do that you got to make the quote fit the Bible not the Bible fit the quote right or take a quote outside of the context of the Bible all right so the Bible says that there's three periods of Daniel 70 weeks a 7 week a 62 week and a one week that adds up to 70 don't give me these quotes I know what brother R saying do you he can't do more than the Bible we've got to take everything brother R said fa's final resting place is not in William brandom sir face final resting places in the word of God Quicken to your heart and that will absolutely say that ain't nothing but the truth like what hady Wright said listen it changed two people's life when she quit that was Quicken to Hur than it you want your children saved get in the message with fervor and say God that ain't nothing but the truth and one day he'll drop down in your heart and he says what do you want don't think that that had right the only one the third listen we are third pull people we're third po people people we're going to have to start speaking it to make it happen not wait till it happens and then say oh I was thinking that yeah right so is the devil remember the devil is an afterthought God's thoughts are Eternal do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it's unfulfilled talking about the sardian church age we'll get to just a second but I went up and looked up the word unfulfilled the word un fulfill means not carried out or brought to completion so the new birth for them was that what it was but it was not taken to completion they could not take a body change with what Martin Luther had but God was happy with what Martin Luther was doing all right and I to this afternoon we're going to look at sanctification I want to bring out something a little different in sanctification because remember sanctifica justification is a definite work boom sir you come from siner to all that past sin yes sir done away with boom amen but sanctification is not a boom sanctification is a microwave no it's an oven it's like campfire it takes a long time but as we in Wednesday night it takes a while for those demons to get all pushed out if you had only one demon to worry with you all be in good shape well praise L pray for me then I got more than one he sometimes we all have our demons but we all have to get them cast out you say well I've been a I've been born again we're talking a different sanctification then but the first part of your Sanctified life is is you got to get cleaned up you got to get cleaned up up yes right now listen the first thing is you have nothing to do with justification I'm going to stop here just a minute you have nothing to do with justification except believing what he's already done absolutely now remember a pardon is not a pardon until it's accepted as a pardon I'll get to that in just a second but sanctification is a work it's a work it's a WIP it's a work in progress remember justification he picks it up and said I'm going to use it you go s ification he still got to get that thing clean and it may not get clean the first time you know whose problem that is yours cuz you love that one and you'll bring your right back in that's why there ain't too many new births brother B says many times back in the 60s there's not many true new births there's a lot of sanctification there's a lot of justification but sanctification listen them things I used to do I don't do them no more that's right they bother me but they butt up against me they don't grab me and take me out take me out like I used to go out right so unfulfilled age is not carried out or brought to completion not having fully utilized or exploited one's abilities or character now that was justification we must believe that God forgave us of our sins we must believe in the grace of God but that's that just G isue started as I was telling them down that brother when brother Barry passed away I said folks this is not an end this is the beginning of his life this is the beginning this is this has red back to before the foundation of the world if you look at it that way then praise God he just began his life brother Dale you say oh he did all this great things and yes he did but he did not begin his life until the other day he didn't begin his eternal part of him that was before the foundation of the world until just the other day he fulfilled that and God said I'm taking him home all right devil didn't have anything to do with that he had nothing to do with brother Barry either God took him when he needed to take him he was tired and ready to go anybody ever said God don't make a mistake he never does if you believe you're one of his yeah he never makes a mistake we know he never makes a mistake but if you believe he's one you're one of his whatever move is made is for your good whatever move is made in your life as brother Bob was talking about Job listen job didn't have the new birth job didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul right he had an anointing of the Old Testament of the blood of bulls and goats and you see what kind of you what kind of attitude he had he wasn't no wowy W you was me though God slay me yet I'll trust him I know my redeemer liveth and I'll Stand in the last days in my flesh what a revelation without the new birth have you considered my servant joob but I will restore the first three ages had the pure word of God they didn't have to restore they heard it from the from the one himself but that one himself had to die and go into ground is everybody with me Jesus Christ had to die and go on the ground he set a corn of Wheat and I'll read it just a minute set a corn of wheat go on the ground and die about us alone but if it comes back what it starts growing it went 120 on the day of Pentecost and they had the pure word of God up until man started getting involved and started pulling it to Pieces all right everybody with me so the first three ages had the pure word of God the fourth age it went back into the ground again because he said in Joel I will restore what was eat right Jesus said the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verely I say unto you ascept a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone I was thinking about that when brother Bob was speaking you look at the people the great people of Faith you would think God never protected a one of them Paul head chopped off Peter upside down crucifixion James and the different ones you read all of them read where all 12 of them got killed they didn't make it except John John's the only one that made it to an old age one of them got pulled apart one of them got saw I mean um Chopped with a sword cut in pieces Christians Born Again people that carry the gospel listen we don't figure out God but remember he don't make a mistake but he said by suffering are we going to learn these things you know why because he knows we're human beings and we are now in the ly and age and we're soft need our AC need our heat need our cars that drive theel that's not too bad but anyway all who live Godly in Christ shall suffer pers ution if our Lord and savior suffered so much them whole 33 years he was alive he suffered the whole time nobody liked him nobody understood him nobody wanted him and then look what happened when when he came back on the day of Pentecost got into a man named Paul they stoned him everywhere he went they stoned him you said boy I don't know if I want to be a Christian or not remember this life is but a vapor come on this life is just getting you ready to get to the next part we are Eternal people inside of us that have come down here in time what to prove God to show that tragedy doesn't destroy us tragedy makes a Believer who they are it made job who he was for eternity will NE will always remember job we'll always remember the ones that that suffered yeah not not them that they suffered the bad things but we remember the good part of all this the good part that came out of whatever we lost or whatever we didn't lose or whatever we had and whatever we didn't have the Bible says all things will be made new do we go are we going to believe that this present suffering Paul said the present suffering has not even compared to the glory that will be revealed in us the glory that we're heading to but yet we let our job we let our family we let all this stuff get in the way that's right put God first amen but he's going to restore all these years he promised he would and who are we are the end of that restoration you and I are the end of that to be restored back to the faith of the fathers ain't that what Malachi 4 says he's going to return the hearts of the children back to the fathers and fathers back to the children right we're back to here and we're going to what we're going to come to maturity in this age because that plant's growing it's growing now whether you believe it or not you can take round up all you want to and spray over it it will produce a crop that's right and I believe I'm looking at it and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God he dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed the present suffering of this time will not be compared to the things that's coming to the things that you wouldn't no nobody in this room or anybody in the world would ever bring anybody back that's already going to the other side oh yeah there's a void there oh yeah it's not going to be it's going to be a new normal but it's happened since the dawn of time we've got a cycle of all this stuff and I I I just believe somebody is going to break that cycle somebody's going to destroy death but it's going to take somebody that's not somebody that's perfect in their own self but you're perfect in Christ you're perfect in Christ you do what he says and you catch the revelation of what's going on which is a progressive revelation as we saw in the Book of Ezekiel ankles knees loin and head there's your four the four life Messengers brought it back four death Messengers eat it down we are now in you and I are in the fourth if you got the Holy Ghost today you've got to the loins but remember thee we got to be able to swim in this gospel that we're talking about now not be babies where every little thing we run all over the place and and and we oh throw our hands up that's right help us you got to change your stinking thinking have the mind of Christ what would Jesus do you know so the fifth days and the sixth days were reformers God was pleased there was a piece of part of their time that they had and God was pleased with that Amen brother tell us the last three Church AG just forms a complete birth so we come to what the woman has has water blood and life all right but now remember it's water blood in life to get you here then you got to grow that's your fourth stage is the word of God helping you to grow into an adult that's what sanctification does that's what the second part of sanctification in the statute of perfect man we've been talking about it you have to be what washed daily you have to Die daily some of those demons are going to try to come back they can't get in your soul but they sure can play in your spirit realm but you you got to know how to handle it you got to be mature to be able to say that ain't going to happen to me no more you've used that tactic Satan one more time and now I know who you are now I know why you're coming and I'm going to absolutely put a shield up I'm going to say God I we were talking about something the other day we got a prophet came in the end time right he came to bring us the word of God he came to bring us the perfect word of God perfect inspiration Divine interpretation right we believe that don't we they come up to him one day and there questions and answers they said brother brandom I've got a I've got a stingy spirit and I'm sure they were all sitting on the edge of their seat getting ready for a um something out of the Bible getting ready for some Revelation that how to get rid of being stingy brother Ram didn't open his Bible what'd he say he said do the opposite who do the opposite but that's the hardest thing for us to do if you're stingy brother R said if you're stingy start giving money away if you're tired of being sick and tired quit being sick and tired if you're sick and tired you're not on God's ground you're on the Devil's Ground so you know that so get over on God's ground that's right do the vice versa he said most people didn't understand what he said but I just said make sure you do the opposite well I can't get up start getting up so justification look it eradicates by faith in what Christ did at the cross the sins of your past nature everybody with me doesn't destroy the man it just chopped off that past sin that you did turns you white not on the inside but white in God's eyes justified in his eyes for the moment yes all right everybody with me yes all right the definition is the act by which God moves a willing person from the state of sin which is Injustice to the State of Grace which is Justice now remember the pardon those of you that may not know or listen to the tape you ought to listen two or three times brother R talks about said there was somebody in a prison getting ready to die and Abraham Lincoln somebody knew Abraham Lincoln and they came to him and they said look I know this man didn't do that there they're doing it you know they're they falsely accused him or even if he did do it I know this is a good man said sir I throw myself at your feet would you pardon this person and so Abraham Lincoln being a Christian man he was he probably thought about a minute he pulled out a sheet of paper and he said I pardon so and so and so and so signed Abraham Lincoln well that man was so happy he took that thing back to the Jailer and he said here this is signed by the president of the United States so he went in and read it to his friend and what his friend do his friend didn't believe right he became became an unbeliever that the pardon of the piece of that can't be Abraham Lincoln's signature he would have come himself or he'd had some kind of presidential seal or see the guy wanted him to come the way he wanted him to come come on somebody we want God to do things the way we want it done but it was a simple pardon and it would have let the man go free but he did not he did not accept that pardon he gave it back to him and he said I don't think it's valid I don't think can do that I don't think I don't believe it's what he said well he was killed the next morning or executed for the crime and remember even brother rown said the Supreme Court had to rule on that because it was a signed signature by the president of the United States to Pardon that person so then the law now is a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon if that man would have accepted it guess what he'd have walked out that day if you accept it today you'll walk out that day that door with your past sins gone yes sir but remember it doesn't do away with your future sins that's right Romans 3 says even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God all right we're all in on we're all in this mess together there's no good ones or bad ones when you look at it that way all right is everybody with me so being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus didn't cost you a dime that's right didn't cost that guy dime if he would accepted that pardon he would have been set free didn't cost him anything you know what it did it cost him his life to not believe it come on somebody it cost him his life to not believe what God tells you to do it'll cost you your life oh no I'm living I'm living no you're dead you're dead while you're alive if you're not born again whom God has set forth to be a pritu through faith through faith in his blood to declare what your righteousness nope to declare his righteousness in other words to cover your sins for the remission of look sins that are passed listen we're not Catholic you can't say God now I'm going to I'm G to make something I'm goingon to do something bad tomorrow could you forgive me and then you just go right on and do it no that's Catholicism this is remission for sins that are passed that's why brother Bram said your past sins are done away with at justification but it doesn't do away with that nature that you were born with that's right all right to declare I say that this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believe in Jesus where is boasting then is excluded by what law of Works no but by the law of Faith therefore we conclude now here's Paul bringing it all together therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the dos and don'ts of the law that's what he saying right acts 13 says be it be it known unto you therefore men and Brethren that through this man Jesus Christ is preached unto you the Forgiveness of sins and by him all that believe are Justified look from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses that's why Jesus Christ had to come and die his blood is what covers you his blood is what eradicates your past that's right praise God what a what but but it's so simple it's complicated to the people out there even maybe somebody here but just keep reading the Bible somewhere it's going to click did you get it the first time you opened your Reader book and and it's John and Mary and spot and Cat and all that other stuff no you didn't get it you get it now Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and if listen and if he justifies you and you continue on with God you're coming to glorification yes listen the thief on the cross all right everybody with with me the thief on the cross we call that the dead be the deathbed confession where he didn't he couldn't go you know he just said Lord remember me just remember me when you come into your kingdom he was justified so he's going to go to glorification Hey listen everybody that goes to heaven is going to have a glorified body even the even The Sinner that's given eternal life because of you or anybody else or cup of water in my name they're going to be living in a glorified body listen we're not going to be living in a glorified body and they're living in a sin cursed body no the sin curse will be done away with so if you're truly Justified you're already glorified in the eyes of God just don't mess it up Don't Stop keep pressing keep pushing amen if you'll push he'll pull cuz remember you got to make a step you got to be willing if you're not willing if you if you're willing to hang on to all this other stuff out in the world God's not going he's not obligated to save you now brother Brown was talking about justification the type of the people the regenerated man who comes to Christ gives his life in but never becomes hid away into the holy Co Holy Spirit he lives a life that he knows he's eating Mana cuz remember all those people ate Mana in the wilderness and that's the type of the Holy Ghost but remember only two took it over that's right there's many people today that's never went any further than the outer Court the veil yet they are Christians look by the millions they enjoy Christ in an outward form they go to church with a consolation of knowing they belong to Spoken Word Church in Lula Georgia but they have never become hid away with him in the inner courts come on that's justification God I'm sorry please forgive me for what I did I want to make my life right help me amen help me and that's God is what just to forgive that's why you call it justification he's just to forgive cuz he's the just and the justifier amen put it all on him he'll take it away yes right so that was justification in that fifth Church age but now let's go to the Philadelphian Church age because this is the age of what now we've got the age of Brotherly Love but this is the age that types sanctification to the Believers to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things sayith he that's holy true ha the key of David and openeth no man shutteth shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an Open Door no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and kept my word remember it's not two shoots anymore it's heading to a stock right it's heading toward the it's heading toward the Perfection it's heading toward the Original Seed but it's not the Original Seed it don't even look like it hello it don't look like it till it goes out here and produces grain again itself that's what we're in now you know the same man that went in the ground Jesus Christ is the same man that went to ground in those people in the fourth Church age he was in by the Holy Ghost we don't think he's two people right okay I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and H has kept my word and has not denied my name the church age lasts from 1750 to 1906 so we're coming up to Aza Street 1906 which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost love of the Brethren is the name of Philadelphia that's what it means now let's look here just a minute brother Ram talks about this I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an Open Door no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and not denied my name a little strength now remember I wrote myself this is my note a little strength it was still though an unfulfilled age because it was the age of sanctification not the age of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right everybody with me so there was a little strength but it was still unfulfilled listen God keeps moving he's moving so sanctification the the the meaning of it is a compound meaning brother Brown tells us many many times of of the Greek word sanctification is cleaned up and set aside for service cleaned up now hang on a minute Martin Luther was cleaned up in his day for his day but John Wesley comes and brings it into a form of worship where that you are Sanctified right all right we'll get to that so cleaned up what happened in that sixth Church age things started getting cleaned up God started started sending missionaries all over the world to clean up the world you ever thought about that that's why the missionary goes to some place he goes to not clean up the mess but to clean up the mess didn't know what Paul did Paul went to the Corinthians to clean up their mess amen and he had to go back twice to clean up their mask but that's what he did but he cleaned them up and set them aside for use or purpose like I said before God picks up the the the bottle he's going to use it so he justifies picking the bottle up right as dirty as it is he justified picking it up because in God's mind he's got used for it all right then he comes to a place he says now I can't drink out of that so I've got to clean the inside of that thing up right so he starts pouring the word in washing of the water of the word he starts pouring the word in and what comes out is trash as sister shepher dream was trash coming out of her right now we know that's in the second form of sanctification but we're talking about the first form of sanctification when you come to the when you come to a realization you're lost and you don't you're sick and tired of being sick and tired you don't want to do what you used to do God is just to forgive you if you'll ask him but remember if you're a smoker yes but that Demon's still there he'll forgive you for what you did but that Demon's still there and he is what motivating you to do that he still got a little needle stuck in your soul can I say it that way cuz your Soul's not sealed yet he's still got a needle stuck in there and he's got a way to get back in there to make you do something that you did before that you previously don't want to do anymore but if you keep going on you got to keep moving you got to keep reading your Bible going to church quit doing the things you used to do quit getting around the people that you were around I lost a lot of good friends listen I lost a lot of good friends just to come to church not that I was trying to live a clean life I'd go to church and they'd want to go party or part or hunt on Sunday that's what I did but I don't do that no more not like that anyway every Sunday so you're set aside you're cleaned up set aside for for service as we said the glass would be but now remember when God picked something up does God ever make a mistake so when you know God's picked you up see there's that those who he has Justified he's going to use you he's already glorified he sees that bottle already clean and workable and full praise God not your neighbor not your husband not your wife not your sister not your brother God in your heart you have a revelation that God did that for you he's not going to lose you now he may do you like he did that brother that said you know I ain't going to have no more what was it Ramsay brother Ramsey the the preacher I don't want to have no more of God I don't want nothing to do I'm just going to start drinking again well he was gone in six months brother Bram said God took him home took his servant home so he wouldn't Mar his name you can get them demons on you really yeah brother brandham tried to kill himself twice if those bullets would have went off he' shot eight kids now that's when he was a kid but when he did that what brother Bob was talking about he was a born- again believer he was a prophet people don't like that but he tried to commit suicide twice cuz he'd come to his wit in out here but what did he say when he leaned over and saw hope and and Sharon Rose he said I almost agreed with the devil he said but something held me and God was protecting that gift he wasn't protecting William brandom he was protecting that gift when he didn't let them bullets go off he was protecting that gift knowing that man would go through that but listen he came out so much better he came out with a fervor he said now I know what I'm doing now I know I don't need to listen to this one that one this one I need to listen to what God Said Yes sir cuz he's the one that took me out of all that so you might have to get to your L of lows you may have to get to the end of your Rob tie knot and hang on Hallelujah come to church read your Bible yes sir yes sir at least try effort Bible says willing so the Philadelphian Church age listen what brother Brown said remember the sardian age started the Reformation that most still must go on until the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes to the full cycle he's talking about Pentecost full cycle planting watering nourishing until it comes right back to Original Seed now he's talking about us he's talking about us while this is going on the tears that were swn will have to go through their cycle and be harvested also Hey listen when those horse riders rode out they SED a seeed they loosed a false Ministry and they had converts they had people that agreed with what they said and they're not bride right Satan's got his people God's got his people just to where it is law of contrast I want you to see something here God works in threes doesn't he he was in the third or pergan age that the church was married to the state the Deeds of the nicians had become the doctrine of the nians that age was the open door for the false Vine once it was backed up by the power of the state it became actually a world system even though it bore the name Christian thus it spread like wildfire but now Three Ages later after a long and hard struggle of Faith here comes the open door to the truth Martin Luther John Wesley they didn't have all the truth but they were the beginning of you and I believing the truth listen we don't do away with them we stand on them we don't do away with anybody we stand on what they believe you ought you better believe the just shall live by faith cuz you can't live by yourself and you can't live by the devil you can but not to be a Christian you can't the word of the Lord now has its day of course the fifth age set the stage for this Mighty move as that age gave us exploration colonization the printing of books John Wesley we know he was the um messenger of that age and we're not get into all what he did because you know what he did he did a lot more than we do he preached 800 sermons in one year he rode 4,000 miles in a nice Cadillac that drove itself and had oh no it was a horse Wesley was a remarkable strong man he says of himself that he cannot remember now any any of you can can can can you do that can you say that you have felt loneliness of spirit a quarter hour since he was born a quarter of an hour what is that 15 minutes there was 15 minutes in his life that he felt bad some of y'all have been feeling bad for the past 15 minutes he slept more no more than 6 hours a day Rose in time to start preaching at 5: practically every day of his ministry preached up to four times a single day and he have an average 800 sermons travel thousand of Miles 4,500 miles on a horse you know why he had a fervor he believed in the power of God he believed God was going to do what he said he would do yes that's brother John get all you can save all you can give all you can remember that he was a good candidate for James because he based his eternal life on faith and works not just faith faith faith and works see what he done is he took Martin Luther said hey do away with works that just shall live by faith now listen John Wesley's Revelation was a little more upgraded he didn't do away with that but he brought the real works of God back into the church that's right the real works of God because listen faith without works is dead yes all right you got to have a little bit of words when you get born again we don't have to chase you to find you every Sunday that's right right he died 88 years old he served God as few men would dare to even think they might let's read this real quick and then we'll close we'll get this afternoon to the angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things sayith he that is Holy now watch He's holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth no man shth and shutteth and no man openeth brother R look he said look these things sayith he that is true now this word true is a very wonderful word it does not mean true in just the sense that is opposite to false God's never been false right remember in our age it calls for the faithful and true witness not that he was ever a false one but remember when you hit that symbol and it's supposed to be a c whatever that what you call that thing Pitchfork or tuning fork when you hit that tuning fork you get a true sound that's what the faithful and true Witnesses so in this age it does not mean true in just a sense that is opposite to false it expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization as in mana mana what Mana was given Mana what Mana or had wiggle tails the next day but remember it's a type of the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost don't have wiggle Tails it's just you can't hold it over you need a new revelation every day you need to pray for God for Revelation Lord help me I'm stuck in a stuck in a rut maybe I'm preaching to me for example we recall that Jesus said Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread look true bread he was the true bread from Heaven John 15 says I am the True Vine Hebrews 9:24 says for Christ has not entered into the holy Place made with hands which are the figure figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us Darkness has passed and the True Light now shineth since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before now watch antitype contrasted with type and substance with Shadow they had a shadow Bible says a shadow of things to come but not the very image I'm quoting you scripture this is the image image right here this right here is not if I hold that up against the light there's a shadow going to be over there and it'll be exactly what my hand is but it won't be my hand so there's a shadow but that shadow types that there's something real in front of that light amen when know in type we know in part part type we know in part we prophesy in part but that which is perfect has come that's why listen that's why the son of man Ministry if Satan will stop right here here come on musician if Satan can incarnate a beast now listen to me real quick let's stand if Satan can incarnate a beast and have him do what he says to do in the garden and he comes down here and incarnates himself in a pope and they even think he's God yes why can't the true God hallelujah come on somebody why can't the true God get in the True Believer and it be God on the earth and it be not a second person but the god the son of man when you raise your hand God rais his hand when you look God lookes when you speak God speaks it can't be a type brother R said this per messenger of Malachi 4 do two things right number one turn the hearts of the children to the fathers then he said after the seals is open open and the thunder sound we are literally turned back this is literal that's a shadow that's a shadow this is literal why you say oh no the the son of man is is is there ain't no way he could be back here on Earth cuz his body's not here well I know that but he made a provision he transferred power he made a provision and said the son of man would be back on the Earth again at the end time for just a short period of time and if we know one thing's for sure if he's not here in physical form he's got to be in somebody or El lied hallu so he takes your flesh the thing that job says this is all rotten it's all vanity it's all felt but he says I'll Stand in My Flesh and I'll see God I'll Stand in my flesh I don't care if anybody got to go by the grave they're going to stand in their flesh and they're going to see God but I pray that we all everyone of Us come to so much of a sanctification to where the devil don't know what to do with us till we be so so slick with the Holy Ghost not slick with the devil slick with the Holy Ghost and when he takes his fingers and starts to jab in you it just slides right off you say oh that can't happen to me cuz I okay you just become an unbeliever we must believe for things that we can't even see right but listen if we know the one they can see it he'll send you somebody to show it to you you just got to believe it were we there when brother brandham had all those dreams and Visions were we there when he went across a curtain at time were any of y'all in that bedroom with him any of you have a camera where you were you photographing no but you know what I believe it cuz it fits the Bible it fits the going AC cross it fits this next life that we're going to the real one it fits so guess what down in my soul it rings a bell that ain't nothing but the truth there's a lot of people don't believe he did a lot of things there's a lot of people don't believe he's round when the cloud and all I really don't care I know in my heart that Christ came to me through that man's message so take all that other junk out of the way and that ain't junk we know it didn't happen but the junk that they're saying out the world that that brother brownan was this I don't care he brought a reality when he stood up and he said this day this scripture preached that and that and that message came forth he was telling us that this day this Bible is been made Alive walking breathing instrumentalities of God I believe that with all my heart if I don't see it I pray God somebody does I pray God that we'll walk into it and one day it'll just happen you know Abraham before the day before he got a body changed he probably was he's he met he met God but he knew that but he was probably still probably when he got up to to tell MDC by he probably had to amen amen he was 99 when MDC met him but what the next morning did he have a resurrection he had a body change he didn't know what to do but he was the the Royal Seed of Abraham is in me and you then that's what's going to happen we'll read the rest of this later God bless you let's sing a song If you
