[1:27:05] he's
[1:27:06] waiting cuz God said I I I'm done with
[1:27:09] this
[1:27:11] one but I'm not done
[1:27:13] yet we still got stuff to do we still
[1:27:17] got things to
[1:27:22] do I want us to remember
[1:27:26] dad as being a very unselfish
[1:27:29] man and I was looking at the scripture I
[1:27:32] Marshall his brother sitting here and um
[1:27:36] he's U not able to speak today but we
[1:27:38] sure appreciate him and his surviving
[1:27:40] brother John sitting back there to I
[1:27:43] don't know which one's my favorite uncle
[1:27:44] now I tell them one of them is and then
[1:27:45] the other one is when the other one
[1:27:46] walks out so I got them both in here
[1:27:49] you're both my favorite
[1:27:52] Uncle John's not thrilled at all
[1:27:56] so but but remember him he was he was he
[1:28:01] was a a brother to these and and
[1:28:04] Marshall couldn't speak so I'm going to
[1:28:05] I was trying last night to to kind of
[1:28:07] look at something and I want to take a a
[1:28:10] little just about four scriptures in 2
[1:28:13] Timothy 4
[1:28:15] verse1 God told us through Paul he said
[1:28:18] I charge thee therefore before God and
[1:28:21] the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge
[1:28:23] the Quicken the dead that is appearing
[1:28:26] in his kingdom preach the
[1:28:30] word be instant in season and out of
[1:28:34] season
[1:28:36] reprove
[1:28:38] rebuke exhort with all
[1:28:41] longsuffering and you got to have a
[1:28:43] Doctrine right and the doctrine is what
[1:28:45] you live by he had a Doctrine some
[1:28:48] people may thought it was
[1:28:50] strange but it came straight from the
[1:28:52] Bible so why would you make it strange
[1:28:54] if it came straight from the Bible
[1:28:57] amen well the time will come when they
[1:28:59] will not endure sound
[1:29:01] Doctrine but after their own lust shall
[1:29:03] they Heap to themselves teachers having
[1:29:06] itching
[1:29:07] ears they shall turn away their ears
[1:29:09] from truth like brother collie was
[1:29:11] saying many people heard the voice but
[1:29:14] they didn't do anything about it and
[1:29:16] shall be turned into fables here one
[1:29:18] right here just for a second but watch
[1:29:20] thou in all things endure affliction
[1:29:24] do the work of an evangelist now my dad
[1:29:26] was not an evangelist he was a pastor
[1:29:28] but he did go to Jamaica 10 times and
[1:29:30] the Philippines and all these different
[1:29:32] places but the work of evangelist is uh
[1:29:35] where's brother Joe Green brother Joe
[1:29:38] Green where you
[1:29:39] at if you can't go send somebody so he
[1:29:44] he sent people all over the
[1:29:46] world preach this
[1:29:48] message and souls were
[1:29:51] saved There Was An established churches
[1:29:53] in different places places a lot of
[1:29:54] people and you'll hear now that that
[1:29:56] like brother Richard's going to tell you
[1:29:57] and I promise you brother juel too we
[1:29:59] wouldn't be standing here without
[1:30:00] brother Dale that's
[1:30:03] right we would not through his ministry
[1:30:06] and through his service to the and
[1:30:08] brother Joe does a lot of work in the in
[1:30:10] the mission fields and he knows that Dad
[1:30:11] just poured out all kind of money that
[1:30:14] that he could have kept but he he gave
[1:30:15] it to the missionary field and we sit
[1:30:18] missionaries so to me he doesn't have he
[1:30:20] did the work of an evangelist he wasn't
[1:30:22] an evangelist but he did the work of
[1:30:24] evangelist he wanted this message he
[1:30:26] loved this message and Jesus Christ more
[1:30:29] than anything in the world and he wanted
[1:30:31] people to know it and he wasn't ashamed
[1:30:33] of
[1:30:34] it so Paul's Talent say look make full
[1:30:37] proof of thy Ministry I think he's made
[1:30:40] full proof of
[1:30:44] that for I am now ready to be offered
[1:30:47] Paul's coming down to the end of his
[1:30:50] ministry for I'm now ready to be offered
[1:30:55] the time of my
[1:30:56] departure
[1:30:59] hand that word departure means
[1:31:04] loosing so let me read it like this in
[1:31:08] the time of my
[1:31:09] loosing is at
[1:31:12] hand amen I have
[1:31:15] fought the good
[1:31:18] fight I have finished that word finished
[1:31:22] in the Greek means carried out my
[1:31:24] command he did it he carried out his
[1:31:28] command so perfect God said you're
[1:31:31] done I'm going to take you
[1:31:34] home praise the
[1:31:37] Lord I finished my
[1:31:41] course course
[1:31:44] means in this life is something carried
[1:31:48] through life he lived his whole life for
[1:31:51] his family but he put God first
[1:31:54] he put the ministry first but he loved
[1:31:57] us
[1:31:59] all then Paul doesn't finish there he
[1:32:01] says look henceforth there's laid up for
[1:32:03] me a what a crown not a crown with gold
[1:32:06] and jewels and all those things that
[1:32:07] would look good but the Bible tells us
[1:32:10] the Greek of that word means a mark of
[1:32:14] royalty I'm glad to be the child of the
[1:32:17] King today aren't you glad to be the
[1:32:19] child of a king today we got Royal Blood
[1:32:23] but that means Mark of royalty a crown
[1:32:26] of not just a regular Crown a crown of
[1:32:28] righteousness righteousness means
[1:32:30] Integrity virtue purity of Life
[1:32:34] rightness correctness of thinking right
[1:32:37] wow that was my dad that was Brother D
[1:32:40] you knew him long enough you knew he was
[1:32:42] who he was and that was it you've got
[1:32:45] what you got he wasn't twoo faced he
[1:32:47] told me one time he said son if they all
[1:32:49] love you you're a hypocrite
[1:32:53] I'm lowering a little bit here but
[1:32:56] that's the
[1:32:58] truth he stood for what he believed and
[1:33:01] believed for what he
[1:33:03] stood and listen like I said before the
[1:33:07] Lord Jesus orchestrated this this is not
[1:33:09] something the devil had anything to do
[1:33:11] with do you believe that you go to a
[1:33:14] funeral and you oh the devil the devil
[1:33:16] didn't do
[1:33:17] this there was something set in motion
[1:33:19] before in the fall that this had to
[1:33:22] happen there had to be we had to come
[1:33:24] the way you're looking at me and I'm
[1:33:25] looking at you now through this flesh
[1:33:27] body right but he came to give us a
[1:33:31] hope to get to another
[1:33:33] place if we have to leave this one here
[1:33:36] brother shes that's okay we leave this
[1:33:38] one here but guess what job stood wayed
[1:33:41] day and he said what I
[1:33:45] know I don't doubt I don't think I know
[1:33:50] my redeemer liveth and in the last days
[1:33:53] I stand on my feet in My Flesh and with
[1:33:56] my eyes I see God we saw God Walk Among
[1:34:00] Us a man name

[1:34:12] Heavenly brother CU we're all we're

[1:34:24] say who met you at the river
[1:34:26] first oh y'all don't believe that oh

[1:34:39] [Applause]

[1:34:51] Dale family we we just a wonderful group
[1:34:54] of people but on Tuesday at
[1:34:59] 5:00 there was a command initiated in
[1:35:03] another
[1:35:06] dimension somebody's fixing to need you
[1:35:09] death
[1:35:10] angel you need to go over there in the
[1:35:13] room in Hall County
[1:35:16] and we're fixing to bring somebody
[1:35:21] here but there was another command one
[1:35:23] out
[1:35:26] from
[1:35:26] heaven where there is no
[1:35:29] death it was not initiated in death
[1:35:33] headquarters it was initiated in heaven
[1:35:37] it was initiated in
[1:35:40] eternity when that Death Angel Hey
[1:35:42] listen Jesus told us he said you have
[1:35:44] what
[1:35:45] passed from death into
[1:35:49] life pass you know if you don't like
[1:35:51] McDonald you pass right by right
[1:35:54] right if you don't like death you pass
[1:35:57] right by Jesus said we passed from Death
[1:36:01] under life so no death angel came and
[1:36:03] got my
[1:36:05] dad no according to John 5:24 he pass
[1:36:12] that that Death Angel got moved over
[1:36:15] brother
[1:36:16] jel Michael stepped in the
[1:36:20] room Michael come got him no no Death
[1:36:23] Angel Christians don't die they just
[1:36:25] fall
[1:36:26] asleep so Michael walked in the room and
[1:36:28] said hey come on you going with me the
[1:36:31] that that Ang said that's mine he said
[1:36:32] no you can't even go where I'm
[1:36:35] going come on somebody you can't even go
[1:36:38] where I'm going you don't even know
[1:36:39] where I'm going to take him I'm going to
[1:36:41] hide him
[1:36:42] away in a pavilion that you the devil
[1:36:45] and all his amps are never going to know
[1:36:47] brother Jonathan they're never going to
[1:36:48] be there that's right he passed from
[1:36:51] death into life what God we
[1:36:56] serve that's my pastor that's my dad
[1:37:00] that's my friend we appreciate you it
[1:37:04] was unusual that
[1:37:05] day the death angel just had to stand
[1:37:08] there and
[1:37:09] watch cuz there was a
[1:37:11] Christian went to a
[1:37:13] place where you dad always told me he
[1:37:17] said if you get a crowd together in a
[1:37:19] funeral he said I've never seen anybody
[1:37:21] walk out of one he said you tell them
[1:37:22] they need
[1:37:25] ation pretty captive audience but you
[1:37:28] need the Lord you know what it wasn't
[1:37:30] because this man himself as a human it
[1:37:33] was because this man received the Holy
[1:37:35] Ghost in his
[1:37:38] soul he had a new birth and that's what
[1:37:40] took him the old birth put him here the
[1:37:43] new birth took him in the other
[1:37:44] dimension but there's no sorrow no grief
[1:37:46] no
[1:37:47] pain and we'll gather with him one day
[1:37:50] yes sir I'll promise you if you don't
[1:37:52] know the Lord Jesus today I hope you

[1:56:37] brother Dell with his Dwelling
[1:56:40] Place all right he's the same

[2:09:52] glorified together am for I reckon that
[2:09:55] the sufferings of this present time are
[2:09:58] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[2:10:01] that's revealed in US
[2:10:04] amen that what was
[2:10:07] revealed to brother
[2:10:10] Dale what happened that Tuesday
[2:10:15] afternoon he didn't go down in De feat
[2:10:18] no sir the only thing he did was change
[2:10:21] Dwelling
[2:10:25] Places then what was revealed he had an
[2:10:27] eternal
[2:10:29] body take him to
[2:10:31] Glory it knew exactly like I said it
[2:10:34] knew exactly where to go

[2:10:42] crisan wait for the manifestation of the
[2:10:43] sons of God so the sufferings of his
[2:10:46] present
[2:10:48] time so
[2:10:52] I want you to look at
[2:10:58] something the thing that brother Dale
[2:11:01] went
[2:11:02] through was the way that God had for him
[2:11:07] to take him from this life to Glory the
[2:11:10] way he went through what he went through
[2:11:13] was what God's way of taking him out of
[2:11:16] this Earth that's right we say why do
[2:11:18] you have to go through this I ask you a
[2:11:20] question
[2:11:22] when they come in the garden of GS they
[2:11:24] got our Lord
[2:11:29] amen all they had to
[2:11:32] done was take him to
[2:11:37] Calvary but he only he pronounced his
[2:11:40] own judgment yes he
[2:11:43] did he had to go through the wine PR of
[2:11:46] the wrath of God
[2:11:47] amen amen he had to suffer and be beaten
[2:11:51] Beyond human
[2:11:54] recognition why do he have to do that
[2:11:58] they could just

[2:12:03] go but he
[2:12:05] didn't Brother D been up behind his
[2:12:08] house and he just had a heart
[2:12:10] attack wait some found him
[2:12:13] and he over
[2:12:15] with but God had a way of taking him
[2:12:18] from this life and that's the way he
[2:12:19] went
[2:12:23] am God don't make any mistakes he don't
[2:12:26] make any decisions God could have
[2:12:28] stopped the whole thing amen he never am
[2:12:32] right to see what Jesus went
[2:12:38] through because Isaiah the prophet
[2:12:40] prophesied his judgment

[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:03] today you go to heaven this is the

[2:24:13] said a man who preaches on funeral we
[2:24:16] was talking about right
[2:24:20] right
[2:24:21] right sister Mila on
[2:24:25] Tuesday she was driving back coming up

[2:24:30] passed at 5:00 and she was coming all
[2:24:31] the way from through
[2:24:33] Atlanta when she got up there late she

[2:25:29] position death would put me in a perfect
[2:25:33] place I wouldn't be having no heart act

[2:26:06] I
[2:26:08] live I said I'll get up over morning I
[2:26:10] said well now Lord here another day you
[2:26:12] give me what you want me to do I go to
[2:26:14] bed at night I ain't like everybody else
[2:26:16] Raffles and Trum I'm not throwing off on
[2:26:18] you I'm not making fun I'm just made
[2:26:19] that way
[2:26:21] when I go to bed at night the last thing
[2:26:22] I say I was listening to a tape the
[2:26:23] other day used to bother me used to
[2:26:25] bother me terribly because I'd be
[2:26:27] praying and i' go sleep
[2:26:29] pray I listened to T the other day the
[2:26:31] prophet said he said that's a sweet
[2:26:34] thing he said just lay down at night and
[2:26:36] be prayed and just go to sleep said
[2:26:39] Thank that always bothered me I just lay
[2:26:42] down in the bed and the last thing I say

[2:27:05] morning Dad preaches on in 2005 that

[2:27:43] strange that PA it in the way is called
[2:27:45] heresy we worship God righten we worship
[2:27:49] God like other people do because some
[2:27:50] people don't know who God is that's
[2:27:52] right if you know who God is you know
[2:27:54] how to
[2:27:55] worship saw Brother Richard 80 something
[2:27:57] year old man barely get up here and you
[2:27:59] see about to fly

[2:28:49] just leave a gap there but go on down
[2:28:50] there so we can get through town and um

[2:29:05] for what you do if it would was for you
[2:29:09] guys we wouldn't have a place here this
[2:29:11] is something with it that we didn't like
[2:29:13] Mom said you I didn't expect this well
[2:29:16] sometimes God has a lot of surprises
[2:29:19] amen but when when God has a
[2:29:21] surprise he's got a purpose behind it
[2:29:25] he's not frivolous he's not like the
[2:29:27] devil and try to trick you into
[2:29:28] something like I said before I heard
[2:29:31] brother Tim C God bless you buddy this
[2:29:34] was orchestrated by the
[2:29:36] almighty the devil didn't have nothing
[2:29:38] to do with it that's right but won't it
[2:29:40] be a time we're going to sing a
[2:29:42] congregational song my dad always sing
[2:29:44] this after he did a
[2:29:46] funeral it's called I'll Fly Away we'll
[2:29:50] have brother Joel brother George
[2:29:51] Canada's son brother Joel I mean Joel
[2:29:54] where Joel Joel's in the back their dad
[2:29:56] was our song leader long time ago and
[2:29:59] this is the baby and Brother Joseph is
[2:30:01] Our Song leader now and that's his
[2:30:02] sister on the piano so we appreciate the
[2:30:04] Canada the family they've always been a
[2:30:05] good part of our family but he's going
[2:30:07] to lead us in the congregation and then
[2:30:08] we will then we will get out of here so
[2:30:10] like I said before we're going to the
[2:30:11] grave site and we're going to have a
[2:30:13] service there just for a few moments and
[2:30:16] then we'll uh eat in the got the place
[2:30:19] over there but you going to go go on now
[2:30:21] not right now but go on
[2:30:23] now you make him feel bad if you
[2:30:28] did we get finished we'll sing a couple
[2:30:31] of songs here of course uh brother D's
[2:30:33] favorite song one of his favorite songs
[2:30:35] was I Fly Away Now growing up and
[2:30:37] listening to I Fly Away there's a a
[2:30:40] verse in there it says when I die by and
[2:30:43] by but we're going to change that verse
[2:30:45] we're going to say I can't die
[2:30:48] Hallelujah by you've heard so many uh
[2:30:52] statements of faith that when you're in
[2:30:55] Christ you can't die you're alive in him
[2:30:58] in fact in John chap 11 it says Jesus
[2:31:01] said he that believeth in me though he
[2:31:03] were dead yet shall he live and
[2:31:05] whosoever believeth and believeth in me
[2:31:07] shall never die amen it's so contrary to
[2:31:10] the way we think amen but you can't die
[2:31:13] when you're a real Christian a true
[2:31:15] Christian and I like to say this and I
[2:31:17] hope it's not out of order but you know
[2:31:19] I was thinking just reflecting on our
[2:31:21] brother the mean things he's taught us
[2:31:22] he's he was a good teacher he was a very
[2:31:25] detailed teacher and I've been his
[2:31:28] neighbor for 15 plus years it's just I
[2:31:31] tell people it's easy to love your
[2:31:33] neighbor and the Lord said when he's
[2:31:35] your neighbor and there's me times that
[2:31:37] things would happen around the house um
[2:31:40] uh Plumbing would break electricity and
[2:31:42] he would come over there and just teach
[2:31:44] you know how to fix it and was just so
[2:31:47] patient but I was thinking you know is
[2:31:50] it that Brother D has really taught me
[2:31:53] something very personal and I want to
[2:31:56] teach you what he taught me he taught me
[2:31:59] three words in another language he spoke
[2:32:01] another language a lot of people don't
[2:32:03] know that amen it's a special language
[2:32:06] and he spoke this through a sign a sign
[2:32:09] language I want each of us to learn
[2:32:12] these three
[2:32:14] words somebody back there has already
[2:32:16] showed
[2:32:17] it and I want each of us to learn if
[2:32:20] there's something you can take away from
[2:32:21] today I want I want you to learn these
[2:32:23] three words I want everybody to raise
[2:32:24] their right hand with their pinky up and
[2:32:27] then sign language this is the word I I
[2:32:32] want you to close your pinky and lift up
[2:32:34] your index finger and open your
[2:32:37] thumb and this is the word love for l i
[2:32:42] want you to close your index finger I
[2:32:44] want you to open that pinky back up and
[2:32:45] keep the thumb open and that is you and
[2:32:49] if you open them all up let's say it
[2:32:51] together I love you amen if there's
[2:32:56] anything his foress it was the love they
[2:32:58] had for you for people and I remember
[2:33:01] many times when we would call him out to
[2:33:04] the pull pit he would he would hold up
[2:33:06] his his hands like this and he said the
[2:33:09] reason I do that is because I want God
[2:33:11] to know that I love him so when there's
[2:33:14] a time in life if if there's anything
[2:33:17] that you can encapsulate from birth to
[2:33:19] death everything the UPS the Downs it's
[2:33:22] love amen it's the love of God that has
[2:33:24] ConEd us here and when you can't speak
[2:33:28] you can still do this amen say I love
[2:33:32] you let's sing this song I'll Fly Away
[2:33:36] amen are you here to worship let's just
