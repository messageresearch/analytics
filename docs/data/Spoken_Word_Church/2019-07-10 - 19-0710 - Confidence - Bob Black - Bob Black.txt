========================================

[Music] opening the eyes open the eyes [Music] I want to see hi shining in oh sure say [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] a man that's our desire to nothing good to be in the house of the Lord let's go ahead and turn umber to Psalm chapter 27 and we'll read the first five verses that's good to be back with everybody as well you know we took a little trip up to to Kentucky and saw some of the the places that brother Brad was birth area and different things and drop the kids off at camp and went on up with it at Ohio and forgotten some good fellowship with everybody and I tell you on the way back that I think the kids got a little bit oh they got a little song that count this year we got it we got them in the car and we just about had a revival on the way back we uh you know it's good to get on that's it's a good thing so but um you know after after the hearing the kids are there there's a lot of rejoicing and different things happen at camp but I just wanted to kind of speak on this evening the topic of confidence because you know where you come back from a camping and everything's you see you know the environment and the atmosphere at camp is it can be a little bit different when you come back to church it's kind of coming to your home Church maybe it's a little bit back to reality back to the real world you go back to your job of different things and but yet there's got to be something to kind of keep you keep you on the straight in there and keep you give you something confident that'll keep you so let's say y'all go ahead and pull that up and well let's go let go let go the Lord in prayer before you read them Lord Jesus we're just so grateful to you tonight or to be able to gather around your word tonight or Jesus and Laura maybe I feel like like David did with us with his sling you know how can I come up against this Goliath but I pray Lord tonight lording you'll do like you did for David and just guide the stone god the words that I say Lord and give me the right words to speak Lord Jesus that you'll help me to articulate it and and phrase it and and just Lord let it be like knife and a razor edge Lord Jesus to go exactly and to be placed exactly where you would have it to be placed we grant it Lord I pray Lord that this won't just be another service Lord Jesus - but Lord that the people Lord will go forth rejoicing and will receive something that will help prepare them on life's way God and give them Lord as the topic I said confidence in your word because we must be confident in this our granite Lord I pray Lord as we give you the remainder of this service Lord we just ask Lord that you'll bless it Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so I'm gonna read from Psalms chapter 27 verses 1 through 5 and maybe maybe y'all young people if you you get a little extra credit with me if you can tell me the one place where brother Branham quoted this scripture after the service I think it's the one place there might be more than one but but there's one very very renowned sermon a very important sermon that brother Branham read this scripture and it it was really odd because it seemed like why would he read this scripture in that message so so y'all think about that and and if it takes you till next Sunday or you know y'all just have fun with that the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though and host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock you may be seated the Lord had his blessing upon the reading of the world so you know I think maybe this this day is kind of this the day the scriptural day that we're living in as a time period when above all else we should have confidence because we're being faced with it the unleashing of all that all the demons that are against the 144,000 that are being gathered at Israel now the demons that are against the Bride of Christ and we're faced with an obstacle that no other Church there's not gonna be another church age there's not gonna be anything else there's not gonna be another messenger after this so there's an obstacle in front of us too that we must take a body change and so to take a body change this record gonna require us to accumulate in ourselves a great amount of amount of faith it's gonna umbrella Brown there's a quote that we're brother under said you must accumulate all these accumulate all these words all these words that that we've been given accumulate all this to yourself so that you can have faith and and and y'all hang hang on with me now don't start falling asleep yet it ain't at anytime yeah so and I'm gonna try to be a little bit you know excited or whatever to keep you so that so that we don't struggle too much tonight and listen I rebuke that evil spirit that will call that sleepest pretty you know the kids we were talking about that it seems like it's almost a spirit that gets as soon as the word begins to go forth then the spirit of sleepiness kind of begins to hover over the congregation listen what I'm talking about tonight is that the confidence that will give us something we we must we're relying on something to give us confidence to be able to take a body change and you know when you look begin to look at what the word confidence that it really has a lot of different meanings you know it can it can it can mean you know you're you're confident in yourself and of course you don't we don't want to be confident in our self and our self how are we gonna take a body change how can we do anything and many times you begin to look when you're struggling life is struggle differ things when you're going through sanctification you begin to struggle in yourself well how do I get rid of this addiction to to smoke a cigarette or vaping or or you know you're going out with the wrong crowd and all those different things that have that pool on you and yet you can't do it of your own self and you begin to realize you try to be confident in your own abilities and your own well I'm gonna just try really hard and it just never works out well it's the same thing with healing it's the same thing with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the same thing with a body change you can make one hair of your head white or black or anything you can't increase one inch of your stature just by trying real hard and you're not going to be able to take a body change real hard but yes so we've got there's got to be something that we can rely on to give us confidence you see and so so another another word of confidence another meaning of confidence is the state of feeling certain about the truth of something you're certain that that thing is true and you know in life many times just maybe just even in a natural life many times we're not we don't come to the point of being certain about something you know many times the young people when you're kind of get you're kind of getting into a place where you beginning to look for a spouse and you're beginning to look for a job and what do you have to base base your decisions and life on you many times you'll presume many times I mean just looking around because we don't want to be too critical or anything but looking around the message universe the message were looking around to other people you can begin to see that they made bad decisions or they make decisions without confidence they make decisions presuming and you know maybe not something to I got to be careful because I but listen look the young people begin to share stories that they've seen things that they've seen world it might be a little girl and a church would say well you know she wouldn't come home one night and they would their parents will begin to look for them and and and get a text late at night and say well mama and daddy I I went I was confident that I found the right man for me just all of a sudden out of the blue and I presume that he's the right one for me and so I went I ran got married and you see what what kind of a decision is that to be is it but you took to just presume well within yourself that that you know what the right thing is to do you you gotta have something to base your confidence on you see you know I'm reminded that that story of Isaac and Rebecca where he sent someone at Abraham sent someone that he was confident with Eliezer to go get a bride for Isaac and Eliezer didn't just presume he he put my beliefs before the Lord let let her say that she's gonna water my camels let her do these things and she she invite he evaluated properly the situation he made very clear he made certain that the thing the situation before he gave her the gifts before he put the gold rings on her he he made certain of the bride that he had chosen and you see you were talking about presuming but but see God is doing the same thing with us he's trying to he wants to be confident of you he's when he gave you the new birth brother and said he was confident that you would not sin willfully he was confident and when he looked upon you that with confidence believing that you would you would you would continue to walk in the word and you see you see so many times we presume we presume that without confidence we presume maybe that we've got the Holy Ghost different ones presume they come to church and they just kind of sit in the congregation and they don't have confidence they think they do but what is your what is your confidence based on now see that's what maybe when I want to hit on with as you come from camp and different things that is your confidence based on the fact that you ran around a church or as your confidence based upon the fact that you shouted and had a had a good real good Jubilee you had a good of revelation time had a good had a good time in the service but what's your confidence based upon the night what's your what's your confidence based upon as you sit here in church is it is it based upon the fact that you go to Lula is that based upon the fact that you have faith in your pastor and you know you you look around I'm I'll be honest when I began to come to this church it was almost a stumbling block for me because people you could almost form a little denomination and say if you don't go this particular church if you don't go to this church then you're going to be lost and you you form a little denomination there because you've you've put your confidence on the fact that you attend this church but you see there you can't that that kind of confidence won't work because there's only one thing that you can be truly confident in and that is the revealed Word of God I'm sure many of you could guess that's where I'm going and you say well brother Bob maybe this is maybe this is a young person to serve maybe this is a sermon for the young people but I believe it's a sermon for all ages because you see even in the older ones begin to they begin to struggle in life and have health problems and things and you begin to wonder maybe if God has left you and forgot about you you begin to what but you know brother Brown said that God cares about old people too and you begin to wonder if God has left you if you begin to wonder if God has left the church maybe wondering if if God is still here in this in this assembly but I tell you God God is here the way you know that the way that you have confidence is Bob based upon us by the faith in God's Word and you see you look at all the examples in hebrews 11:8 all the examples of the great soldiers of faith and many times they didn't have something some some kind of sensation or something to look at you remember when when the three Hebrew children were led down into the fire I wonder if they felt really good I wonder if they were shouting Jubilees and everything but they went down into that furnace based upon a faith based we put based upon a confidence that they had with God that they knew their God and they knew that those that believe their God would do great exploits they begin they begin to walk down into that furnace even when the guards fell away because they knew they knew who they believed in and they said if God would deliver us and that's great if he will not deliver us and that's fine too we are prepared to die and and and you remember Daniel the story of Daniel and he then went down into the Lions Den I wonder if he what might was may be running around with it with great anointings and all of these things you see you can't put your confidence in a feeling you can't put your confidence in the fact that you ran around but you can put your confidence in a revel of Jesus Christ you see that is even the evidence of the new birth personally to you the evidence of the new birth is that God has given you a revelation God has revealed himself to you not maybe in an Old Testament way where he gives you a like a ware of a revelation for the time and then you go away wondering if you wondering if something really happened but the new birth experience is a confidence that God gives to you I'm jumping ahead of myself listen so confidence confidence is you know another thing that confidence is so confidence could be shellfish surance self-assured confidence confidence could be is the state of feeling certain about the truth of something and and a lot of times confidence has another word is is when you trust somebody to keep a secret you place it in their confidence and so you tell them something and so you see the confidence in the Word of God the confidence in God confidence in a believers life always has something to do with the word the word being spoken and so when God places his confidence in you he tells you a secret he gives you a secret that only you know because there's something personal to you it's a personal relationship with you something something that you can maybe try to explain to others and and when you so is it you know you listen to so many others testimonies of how they got the baptism and only ghost and a lot of times it can be confusing what the baptism the Holy Ghost is because when you begin to explain what happened to you a lot of times the explanation involves running and shouting and and and and and it involves that the the the stimulation of a revelation but deep down on the inside down in that soul something quiet and mysterious took place down on the tabernacle of hearing inside on the inside where you're shut in with God where the curtain closes behind you and nobody else maybe can see what really took place in there because there's something there only you and God know and that's confidence that's confidence when when you can look through that smoke coming off the altar of incense and peer into the Holy of Holies and look over that mercy seat and see the glory of God coming back to you and enter into communion with him that's the confidence that the world cannot take away that's a confidence that that is far beyond maybe just running around and jumping and screaming and shouting a confidence that's far above just an anointing on your flesh or on your spirit a confidence that comes by the see word of God being planted down on the inside but you know you many times confidence confidence comes by and experience and confidence comes by a little journey you know you wouldn't those of you that like me that are and my wife they're training up our children and how to drive it takes a while for you to get that go ahead and laugh at you it takes a while for you to get confident in their ability to turn them loose and let them have free rein with that it takes comfort it takes awhile to have confidence and you see the same a lot of people in the Bible went through a journey you're going through a journey a journey where at the end of that journey God will have confidence in you you see Abraham when he got called maybe God had confidence in him now don't get me wrong but he he wants to see it play out you see and he'll give you tests and things that you go through so that he can observe and so that you can understand yourself that that you truly do believe in God's Word and so so then when you when you have gone through the experience you can look back and you can say I know because I was there when I was there within the spirit film I was there when God gave me a revelation Abraham could look back and say I was there God called me and turned me aside and I went in a different direction I was there when I parted ways with a lot I was there when God put me to sleep and he he moved between the sacrifices I was there when I took God at His Word and I I took my son the promised son and I took him up on the mountain and raised up my knife and I was there when Jehovah Jireh came on the scene and provided a lamb he provided a sacrifice I was there and you see that's the kind of confidence that comes from a new birth a new a born-again experienced the confidence well you can look back and say I remember I was there when God gave me faith I was there when virtue was birthed into me I was there when knowledge I was there and all of these things were put into me I was there and you see Abraham he had such confidence with God that for 25 years he held on to the promise until he could hold that baby in his arms he had my when you look at these old soldiers of faith and think about think about the troubles and the problems and things that we do you know maybe all the different therefore the different problems that we suffer in our flesh and all these things just keep hanging on because the same God that Abraham had confidence in that same God is here that you can have confidence in the same God that gave Abraham his children it's the same God that will give you your children if you just have confidence and believe and hang on oh my I'm gonna just share this little test to speak of their children brother brother brother Ronnie long when he was preaching up there in Ohio he he began to share a testimony from behind the pulpit about how when he was in Alaska a this brother came up and began to cry out for his children he said I want all the people that the ministers and whatnot to come up and pray for me because my son I don't know where he is and he's been it was in the wilds of Alaska out there in the middle of nowhere probably many hundreds of miles away from civilization and he said I I don't know where my son is and he's not a creep wanting to be saved and so they began to call out to God for him and begin to to pray for him and begin to believe with him and and at the end of the service that brother Ronnie said he looked in the back of the church and there was a stranger came in and he said it turned out that it was that man's son that out of nowhere in the middle of Alaska had showed up why because the prayer of faith was prayed over that brother and he came see God had been working on the sea I believe God knows you're gonna pray before he before you actually do it the God knew he was good they were gonna pray that prayer and he had him walking in the back of that church and he gave his heart to the Lord and he's still serving the Lord because he checked up on him but you see when you turn your faith and loose will you have confidence with God it will cause the reaction if you get on your knees and begin to cry out and call out to God for your children the Spirit of God will move upon your children just like he moved upon the earth and called sea to come up just like he moved upon Paul's heart just appalled just how he moved upon all the ones down through time to God what God is still able God is still God and I have confidence in that listen I know this is maybe a simple sermon tonight but if anything if you get anything out of this remember that God is still able have confidence in him believe on him have have the same kind of confidence like Peter did when Jesus said come to me and he took a step out of that boat and put his foot on the water and something was holding him up there was actually a substance that was holding him up he had confidence in the words of Christ he had confidence that if Jesus said come when he looked at Jesus walking on the water he knew that if Jesus could do it I believe he believed that I can do it too and that you know Jesus told us that he said greater works than these shall do their works that I do shall you do also you'll go into all the world preaching the gospel laying hands on the sick and they shall recover and all the other things because God has put his spirit into the church he's put his life into the church to give us confidence do you think about little Mary coming to Jesus feet with confidence not knowing what the reaction of Jesus would be when she began to wash his feet and she knew that something special about that man and it wasn't right for him to come into that house and not be greeted and not have his feet washed and not be anointed and she began to unknowing his feet with confidence knowing that he was the Messiah I believe that she knew who that man was and she came with confidence and when he looked up but not with scornful eyes but he looked up and he said your sins forgiven your sins though they are many are forgiven you because she had confidence she had confidence in that one she had confidence in the word that was sitting there in front of her and if you and I will have that same kind of confidence in the word that we have heard whether or not we feel anything whether or not we were honor whether we shout but if we'll just take a simple faith just believe on the Lord God that God will work wonders listen I believe that God is still a miracle working God you know sometimes many times as you just go through life you can get into a rut where you begin to think that God is still not working he's still not moving and we we were coming back and we heard many testimonies from the young people of great miraculous things to work God working in the young people and listen if God was working these little eleven and twelve year olds that are laying hands on one another and seeing healings in their body right under their fingertips while they're praying for one another a little twelve year olds going up to one another do you want me to pray with you do you won't meet me print let's all pray together and God doing things I wonder maybe if the older ones if we're if there's something lacking if there's some kind of confidence lacking in our lives Jesus said let the little children coming to me because a little children up in Humbert encumbered by but by egos and and pride and malice and all the things that that the older ones maybe let just kind of we can almost close ourselves with wondering whether or not somebody likes us and all those things but a little children could just they just run one another under one another let me pray for you I love you and everybody loves one another you know I believe that's what the Holy Spirit was sent for to do when the Holy Spirit begins to come into the lives of the believer it makes you drunk drunk on that stimulation of Revelation like they had on the day of Pentecost a drunk man will love everybody a drunk man don't care who you are drunk man will put his arms around somebody's I love you I love you now I will I I want to be your friend and that's that's what I believe well I believe we're lacking but you see our confidence is in Christ let's read one quote number one because I you know confidence comes from words words words can even in a relationship and a marriage relationship can can can can create an atmosphere can cause heart feelings for years and and there's this this profound quote that brother Graham said I think this is the only time where he mentioned this golden bowl in the heart that is affected by your words that you speak and he said this and believers tell this will now remember happiness does not consist of how much of the world's good you own but how contented you are with the portion that's allotted you so that's what it be I said now there'll be times that you all won't see things like he's talking about this married couple that are a couple that he's talking to you that will they will get they want to get married but always remember you're still in love when you see one set in the way and the other one don't I said give in if they're wrong it'll show after a while it'll be all right I said there's a little Bowl and a human heart that is full of gold and oil called love if it has ever broke it can be healed up but there'll be a scar there as long as you live that little Bowl down in a human heart that brother branham said the way that thing gets broken is by words you see a married couple going along through life and how important it is to say the right words to one another to Express at you know without that is what builds confidence confidence in a spiritual relationship the words that we hear from God build our confidence and God is not telling us we're dogs in this day God is calling us his bride God is telling us that he's confident in us God is telling us saying he we're gonna take a body change and you see yeah I was listening to a testimony I maybe I couldn't tell you all the details but this this brother that was this brother that that brother Branham had had told him in a vision that he was gonna marry this girl and they they got married and he said over time you know I begin this is this is a you talk about people believing in soulmates which is something brother Branham said I never I never taught soulmates I never taught that but people believe that you you believe you know when you find that the right one the person that that that you commune with that is right for you and how much greater a matchmaking could it be for the prophet of God Himself to match two people together which is what happened in this situation and if you want to know details you can ask me later and I can I can I can hunt that up for you with this brother and sister they got married and and the brother began to share that that over time he began that he began to begin to speak hateful to that to his wife and begin to now this was a match that was matched by the prophet of God and he began to speak words to her that he said you you could not imagine somebody speaking words like this to somebody and and over time those words began to crack that Golden Bowl because brother brother said once that Golden Bowl gets cracked and the the thing the contents run out it's hard it's hard to repair that and after a while they got they ended up getting divorced you see because words matter the things that you say to one another matter you can ruin a good set up like that a good happy marriage like that because of the world the things that you say and you say well it doesn't matter what I say to my wife she's my wife or whatever and he began to put your thumb owner and just kind of put her down or whatever you know I don't believe that God puts his wife down God I believe that the wife of the bride of God is more than that would say just a byproduct the wife of God in this age is the mystery of God the mystery being revealed the mystery of God revealing himself in the church she and God is speaking words of encouragement and words of faith to her words to build up her confidence and you see maybe I wonder that's really the point of this message tonight is is I wonder if the bride in this day is confident enough to realize who she is I wonder if she's confident enough to realize what God has given her I wonder if she's at a place where she realizes that God is confident with her that God has put his life in her let's get let's go to the next one number two brother when I said in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said you mean here that's married why did you marry your wife and see I love the way that brother Branham phrases this he's phrasing it in a confident optimistic manner because you know there's a lot of people that just marry their wife because of carnal desires they just marry him because they just fell into it it was just a big ol accident but here he's speaking something to the church he's he's saying you married you married your wife because you proved it out he said you you had confidence and faith that she'd make a real wife and mother and so forth women back to your husband's the same way sweethearts are thinking of marriage you're studying the man you marry or the girl you're marry you must have faith in them or you better not marry them you better have confidence in them and you know what what kind of confidence should a young man or a woman in the message today have and the person that you want to marry the kind of confidence were they you know that they are a real true believer because they have confidence in God they have confidence in God and see you don't into something just having having like a hope so maybe so have enter into enter into and engagement enter into a relationship where without putting your confidence in that person you don't just presume something you see and God is not presuming with us because you see he had confidence with us before the foundation of the world he knew that that attributes they were predestinated in him would be manifested in each of these church ages he knew that she would be sitting here this morning he knew what your reaction to the word would be and he knew if he could be confident and you or not and that's why he gave you the new birth is because he knew that he could be confident in you but you see words confidence comes from words our confidence comes from the words of God it comes from the Word of God because we're not you know this Bible this Bible is not I found a quote the other day it was one of those quotes that I found it and then I lost it and I could I couldn't find it again but in that quote brother Aaron was saying this is not just any other book this is not a book like the Koran or like the bug ID so whatever it is that the Buddhists read that that one of those books it's not just a book that when you go to the library or the bookstore that you go to the self-help section and you pull off a book so that you can better yourself so that you can be a better person this is this is the word of God in letter form the attributes of God distilled into this letter form and it is so perfect that over thousands of years of time the message in in the book of Revelation is the same as in the book of Genesis it's the same as in the Book of Isaiah it runs in perfect continuity so that when God reveals his mystery to you you but you can begin to read these things read a subtext between the line because you're part you're part of him you're his wife it's a love letter to you and you can read it with that understanding with that knowing so you see what gives you confidence what gives you confidence is the preaching of the gospel the Bible says Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and I want to dwell on this for a little bit because every time my kids get back from a camp one of the things that they share that gave them confidence is when they were sitting in the congregation they would think something in their mind and the minister a minister whoever it might be would turn and look at them and point and say you think you're not going to get anything tonight or whatever it might be and you see the Word of God is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart God is still able by the preaching of the gospel to turn to speak to whatever is in your life whether it might be personal struggle wherever you are with sanctification or the new book of traveling up the statue of a perfect man whatever it is God is still able to speak to the situation that you're dealing with the problem that we have many times is that when the word goes forth we are not confident you know many times many times confidence comes from somebody getting a behind the pulpit that lacks these virtues because brother having said that might that would be the biggest stumbling block is to see somebody saying that you need to be living this to do it and then you didn't you walk outside maybe or walk at the cat wherever you are and you stumble over the fact that that that person is missing some of these the missing temperance missing patience those things have not been birthed into their life in it and you you can begin to stumble at the fact that it's a man up there behind the pulpit but yet behind that man are still coming forth the words of God and that's what that's what is almost a mystery of the preaching of the gospel it's a mystery you really now let's think if the Word of God if you could gain confidence by going out and staring at the Sun like they do with the east then that would be the thing that you should do if you would get confidence by going out and pounding your head with a rock or bio by just listening to the birds tweet and chirping the trees then that would be the thing for you to do to get confidence but the way that you get confidence is by the preaching of the gospel because the preaching of the gospel is the Word of Life to you the preaching of the gospel is the greater works that Jesus talked about and Titus one through three it says but hath in due times it let me read this but hath ndu times manifested his word through preaching manifested his word through preaching and many times we stumble over that we stumble because we think well the preaching of the gospel is too rough or it's not rough enough or we think what will they miss quoted a scripture like little many times brother Ram would say 700 instead of 7,000 or whatever well they miss quoted Scripture and so I'm just gonna play some aside I'm not gonna listen to that ministry anymore or or here's the big one they hurt my feelings they hurt my feelings like you know when you come to when you come to the Church of God and the word is going forth if you realize where that word is coming from if you have confidence where that word is coming from it's coming from the Father it's coming from the Lord God Almighty to polish you up to shape you and to mold you into his image and so that's why brother Brennan said if you can't take correction then you don't know who your daddy is you don't know that that word is coming from your father you don't know that the word the New Jerusalem is the mother of us all you don't know who your parents are you don't know who your daddy is and that makes you a bastard born child of God that's why if you can't take correction and listen I I feel like this is I feel like we're almost stressing this because people get hurt right now I begin to realize why not for all these years brother Dale has told us sit on your feelings when the word is God being of God is being preached sit on your feelings because the word is what will benefit you the word is sharper than a two-edged sword let it cut and mold and shape in His image you know the problem is the devil don't like being exposed and when the world is going forth it causes a reaction because of you to come out on the church Santa I feel like he was preaching on me I feel like he was he had some kind of personal motor and objective of course that's even worse when it's the local ministers because we live within we walk with you and we do within you begin to think within yourself where they just got something against me well you know I believe when the word begins to come forth ah you don't have time to think up here when you're preaching if the word comes forth and it slices and it cuts let it cut where may even if it cuts me even if it cuts myself then let it cut and slice where it may yeah you know you know brother that story in the Bible where that little the very first Gentile woman to see America the very first Gentile in the Bible to see a miracle Jesus called her a dog she was saying she was trying to she was trying to approach him using the wrong tile son of David and he said he said my daughter and and he said he the answer not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cries after us but he answered and said I'm not sent but under the lost sheep of the house of Israel and then she came this she came after he said I'm not I'm not said to you what if a minister told you that wonderful Minister said I'm not sent to you but that's not what the ministers are saying the day the ministers are declaring a positive confession to you nobody's calling you a dog but she she when Jesus told those things to her sheep began to worship God and I believe that if every one of us could begin to take that reaction when the word begins to slice and cut just to worship God just to hold up holy hands lift up holy hands I begin to praise him and thank him for the cutting thank you for the slicing then you'll see a miracle like she said even the dogs ate the bread she turned and she began to worship and called him Lord she said Lord and she begun to worship him and I see her see her approach was right many times us while we don't have confidence because we want it on our terms we want the minister to say something we want to diminish her to just stroke us the right way and pay us the right way and preach on our topics and and don't say something that we don't like and and if the minister says something that we disagree with or even maybe something that the pastor disagrees with then we toss them out and we won't never listen to them again listen I believe that the ministry I believe that the ministry is growing too because listen look if you look back 20 or 30 years ago the ministry is not preaching the same thing today that they were back then they're preaching that they're preaching the son of man now they're preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ into the church they're preaching a bride coming into reality they're preaching an adoption I went out to a web site the other day and I began to look through the sermons and I began to I began to marvel because they're preaching adoption and you say you begin to think in yourself well nobody else in the message is preaching like we are here at this church listen there's a five-floor ministry all around the world that is preaching the same gospel and maybe they're not wording it exactly the same way that you or I are or whoever might word it but this there's a bride all around this message and they're catching the revelation I believe it so you see you see the preaching of the gospel is actually part of the greater works that Jesus said greater works shall you do greater works let's meditate on that for a little bit in John 5:20 she just said for the father loveth the son and show with him all things that himself doeth and he will show him greater works than these that ye may marvel I wonder if we have confidence enough to marvel I wonder if we realized the marvelous Ness of the preaching of the gospel when you come to church and you hear something that that will quicken you and give you confidence and give you faith in this our faith to receive healing that is something marvelous for as the father raises up the dead and quickeneth him he's just going around raising up the dead and it was the father working in him and one day Jesus would die and down in the ground but before he died he had confidence that his flesh would not rot he had confidence that before his flesh would arrive it would that Christ would raise him up from the grave so he said for as the father raises up the dead and quickeneth him even so the son quickeneth whom he will I want to declare to you I believe that the son of God has been working down through the seven churches quickening who he will through the preaching of the gospel because that's what Jesus meant in John chapter 14 verses 10 to 13 he said believe us now not that I am in the father and the father and meet the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go under my father and whatsoever she ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son I believe those words were a promise to the church that when God put his own life into the church he would manifest his own attributes in the church and the same thing many times we lose confidence and the fact that he is still Hebrews 13:8 he is still the same yesterday today and forever listen if he is able to heal people up at the camp if he is able to restore lost children up in Alaska if he's able to do all these things he's able to do it in Lula - he's able to do it because he's still the say he still Jehovah Jireh he's still the same so let's listen to what brother Branham said about in that day on Calvary about greater works he said now notice I appreciate whoever's doing the quotes by their y'all on the ball the greater works was to have the power in the church power in the church and listen that don't mean when you feel like you have power power is something that comes from confidence with God a revelation of who he is and a revelation comes from the word when the word is reveal to you that gives you confidence regardless of whether it's raining or sunny or whether you're in the inner court out of wherever you're standing your your your inner innermost being is in that Holy of Holies with God the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it took stooped degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life you know what that means that he wanted you to have a part to play in this he didn't want to just do it all himself and he didn't want to just let the church age messengers do it all themselves because under each church age messenger you would have the preaching of the gospel listen you could even have a little housewife preaching to her little children gathered around and she can impart eternal life to them it's not just the ministry of the ministry the ministry that is imparting life listen when you gather around and Bible studies in your home as I know you all do because I'm speaking positively I'm speaking confidently I know you do that because you're all Christians here and you want to raise your children up just like Abraham did God that is a scripture in the Bible that says God gave all of these promises to Abraham because he knew he would teach them to his children so when you gather all your little children around your knee like John Wesley's wife did when you gather them all around your knee you are imparting eternal life to them because it's passed down it's passed down from one believer to the next it's hand pass it like passing an actual torch because you are the light of the world you have that light on the inside and that light is passed from the one to the other by the words that you speak by the atmosphere that you create and you create an my sphere of worship I had an atmosphere of faith by the words that you speak you know brother Brown when he got into a meeting where that word was being spoken he began he could actually see that milkiness of faith milkiness of the people believing as they received the words that were spoken the word the word is what creates that atmosphere do you have confidence that that is what creates the atmosphere that's what that's what's such a stumbling block it's not such a stumbling stone almost to many people is that this word is the thing that will give you confidence and will trade it off so many times for something else we'll trade it off for the new spirit that God gives you he'll give you a new spirit he'll give you a new spirit but that's not the confidence here that's not the faith on the inside now it might feel good when we come to church and everything but when when you begin to look into the word and it begins to open up to you and you begin to see yourself in the scripture and identify yourself I see it it's almost hard to explain but when when God begins to reveal himself to you it's like the veil comes off of your eyes and you begin to see things as they really are I begin to look I like to read about and study on how other people got the new birth how other people's experience was and when you begin to look at Martin Luther and John Wesley's lives just for example you begin to look at how they had they had confidence in the word confidence in the word is what gave them brought them to a place of the new birth oh goodness lift up those dreary aliens it's not time to take your rest because when you look at how other people's experiences you can begin to compare their experience to yours and see if it matches up if compare and see if it matches up with the word you see Martin Luther and John Wesley they both they both came to thunderstorms Martin let Wesley on the owner road and John Wesley out on the ship and it was a big storm that rose up in both of their lives and in both of their lives they began to realize that they didn't have the confidence that they thought they did now in Martin Luther's case he was going down the road and the Lightning began to strike if it struck a big old tree right next to a kaboom and a my goodness he really he realized he began to cry out to God but he didn't know how to cry out too he was still all up in that that Catholic system so he began to call out the saint an and you see in that moment you know he was trying to do something he was trying to and that's how many of us do we try to do something in our own ability but you know when you begin to turn to the world of God that is where your confidence really comes from so you see when he got his confidence he was studying in the scripture and he began to look he was reading the Latin the Latin of that scripture in Habakkuk chapter 2 verse 4 that says behold his soul which has lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his face and he began to look up the word just and meditate on that and and in the Latin that he was reading that the word was just if Akane that sounds like a big justification in the Latin they were translating a word that meant to make righteous by something the church gives you by something that you do but how many times you can beat yourself so about how many of novenas you can say but he began to look back in the original Greek and he read the word akio's and I might not even be pronouncing that right but it don't really matter because you see God was speaking to him as he looked into the word he looked into the word and began to open up to him that it said the original Greek translation meant to count righteousness in other words that you were righteous because God gave you his righteousness it was not something that you did it was something that he did and all of a sudden the word began to open up to him and maybe he didn't feel anything I don't know maybe he felt something but but yes something down on the inside was quick and a spark was lit and and it transformed the whole world and it began to reform the world by that little just that little revelation of what the new birth really is because the new birth is the justification of your soul that God has given you his righteousness you see you see how simple the new birth is see how simple faith in God is and and and look let's meditate on John Wesley for just a little bit as the time creeps around John Wesley there in that thunderstorm on the only ocean as the waves began to rock the boat and and the lightning was striking and he began a begun to look at those Moravian families and even the Moravian children and marvel at how even the children were not afraid they were like if God takes my life then I'm confident that my life is in a place where I'd know where I'm going I'm confident and the one that has redeemed me I'm confident that the price has been paid and he looked at them he looked at their faith and began to wonder that he have that same kind of faith you know when he got back to England after after going into the America you know he preached continued preaching even without the knew that he knew he didn't have the new birth if somebody said preach faith until you get it and then you can preach it cause you have it and he began to keep preaching faith and and he one day he began to meditate on the scripture and he began to look at scriptures like 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 4 that says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and he began to realize through the word through the promise of God that God had had made these promises to him that whereby God could give you the divine nature of God and his confidence was placed in the Word of God where his confidence previously had been placed in his own good works and just doing right and all those things I wonder tonight if many may be here could our confidence might be placed in things that we do good legalistic message believed in life where we don't the women are not cutting their hair and their their dress inappropriately maybe but yes something down on the inside you haven't quite opened up that door of your heart to let him down on the inside you haven't quite opened that door of faith to let him have complete dominion because you see as I began to meditate on confidence in the scripture and began to think about all these different Junction times there was always a program taught that there were three Exodus and in each of these Exodus is coming out and going into at each of these times there was always somebody that didn't have confidence there was always somebody that believed and you know what Brooke what God did well after he dealt with him after he he labored and was patient with him the Bible says rising up early speaking the word to them after dealing with him finally he would turn and go to a different group of people y'all all right you look like you're all right so I have confidence that you're all right and I'm just gonna breeze through this and try to get through this at numbers chapter 14 the Bible says that because all those men which have seen my glory that here we are in a Kadish Barnea and they're fixing to go over into the promised land just like we're fixing to go over into a body change all this the third Exodus so you come out and you've got to go into that each exodus is I mean but he said because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness effort and I've tempted to me now these ten times and have not hearken to my voice surely they shall not see the land which I swear under their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and has followed me fully him will I bring into the land wherein he went and his seed shall possess it and so do you see what happened was they that generation they failed to have confidence that God was able to take them over into the Promised Land so I began to turn to a younger generation he began to take turn to a group of people including Caleb that he knew would have confidence that he could take them over let's look at the third Exodus in Acts chapter 13 46 or the second Exodus I'm sorry let me just give an overview of this because I gave it a little Bible study to my kids the other night on that what the three Exodus is were because a need that came out of Egypt and went to the promised land they came out and went into and then they came out of the old tested that the the Pharisee achill and sad you see ideas and they went into the promise of the new birth in the second Exodus and the third Exodus we come out of the the the the ideas and the the the denominational ideas of the seven churches and we go into the promise of the Son of Man into the message into the capstone revelation into a body change but you see in each of these Exodus ha's there was somebody that was left behind because they did not have confidence in the revelation of their day in Acts chapter 13 verse 46 it says then Paul and Barnabas blacks bold and said it was necessary that the Word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the Gentiles so they're in the second Exodus God turned from these people hood and we know the Jews were blinded in the whole story behind that but they yet they could not lay hold to confidence in the scripture confidence that God was able to give them the new birth is what it was and so God turned it to the Gentiles and then in the third Exodus in Revelation you say well where is attorney where is a turning away in this day in Revelation chapter 3 15 to 16 he said I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because you say and you see in this day God has poured out everything to us he's giving us the full revelation of the word and yet you see in many message churches even in many churches people are lukewarm and they won't they won't go and pour through the scripture like the brains they won't get into the scripture and you see maybe maybe here's where the nut does the sword that's there gets to slicing as you see ones come out after service and they go out into the parking lot maybe and they begin to say well I don't even halfway understanding me the thing that's being spoken out I don't even oh I I'll tell you what I begin to be grieved when I hear things because listen Wade has laid out the seven seals laid it out so even a brain-dead person if we could begin to understand the seven seals you could just about be laying there as an invalid and yeah and then you you won't go and study and you won't go read and you won't go find out what it says and then you go out into the park come out and begin to say I can barely keep I don't know what's going on I don't know who to believe I don't know if this is something that that Levi or or our brother Donny or whoever is preaching I don't know what the truth is and you begin to wonder listen it's a time we're like a Katie's bar near where the ministers Joshua and Caleb began to tear their garments it's a time when you begin to wonder other people catching the revelation of the hour or are they gonna just be left behind is God gonna turn and just spew them out of their mouth listen I know listen let's be frank here I believe that there are the foolish virgin is going to come out of many message churches because in many message churches people are foolish people of virgin City and churches untainted by the things of the world untainted by the denominational ideas but they if they sit in the church and they believe they're okay and they won't go on to receive the confidence of the word for their day they've lost confidence in the ministry they lost confidence in the man behind the pulpit they've heard almost lost confidence in the word that's been delivered to them and they say well I don't even know I barely even know I don't know what the message is about I don't know what's about so and without knowing what's it about what all that I'm left to do is return back just kind of symbols of my face just kind of artifacts of my fate like that like the Catholics were you'd they would they would maybe cling a whole to to like a nail that they thought came from Jesus or cling to like the Shroud of Turin or something and now listen you can make anything a relic you can make listen I don't even Li listen to tapes anymore because I don't have tapes tapes or a thing of two or three generations ago not not two or three generations come on brother bar tapes tapes you're a thing of ten 20 years ago we don't listen to tapes anymore we've got it on our phones but yeah you can put that up in your hole you could put it on your wall and hang it on your wall and say look at me I have confidence I have confidence in this relic and you can make it a relic you can make it a relative cuz it's hanging on your wall and you put your confidence in that thing without receiving the revelation of Jesus Christ in your life you can even make you can even make the prophet of God something that you put I believe that God sent a prophet that's all well and good and that's maybe something that we preached about twenty or thirty years ago but it's time for you to receive the revelation that that prophet priest it's time to you for you to get into the message and find out the things that he spoke about so that you might have confidence because listen listen just sitting around and clapping about that God sent a prophet will not give you confidence just sitting around and saying that I believe that that we are sitting around and saying that that we're in a particular place and like the scripture that brother Wade ready if they say go into the desert or go over here don't believe them because you know where the Word of God is you have confidence that he has in you and you the word is nigh you even in your mouth the words that the prophets spoke are now in your mouth and you have the ability to speak them to your family to the to your co-workers to the people that you walk with and talk with to listen the Word of God is not just in the ministry's mouth the Word of God is and that I believe is the mystery of this day the mystery that the ministers are preaching is that Christ is in union Christ the hope of glory is in here let me let me read that quote my goodness Tom's running away with me listen let's go to quote number 15 and you know I'll try to wrap it up here and adoption number four and he said now he said and this is I'm gonna get brother Louise credit for this because he shared this quote he said you don't have to give me credit for finding this but that this is a fantastic quote and I'm using this quote you can use it again brother Lewis but I'm gonna use it for now he said now he said he he made known to us the mystery get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that and just watch how it goes start running that if you sit down with their message software and just type in the mystery and see what it says run that through the message and see what it comes back with this afternoon I had all about 30 minutes to study just to look the lesson over maybe not I'll say half of that 15 minutes between the times and I got to running and I thought the mystery how mysterious and the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament then back over to the New Testament Todd something together see the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will the mystery of us sitting together remember it cannot be taught in any seminary it's a mystery you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God now listen I believe a minister should be plain so the way you don't leave when you leave you don't wonder what I believe because I believe I believe that this is why God gave the preach the preaching of the gospel is to reveal the mystery and so if you just sit at home this might stir up some controversy whatever say it anyway if you just sit at home and listening to the tapes you are missing the mystery you're in danger of missing the mystery the mist what is the mystery you say oh well I don't somebody somebody was telling my kids the other day well you know what if you want to sit at home and listening tapes that's fine or if you want to come to church that's fine just whatever you do and you don't have any there's nothing to stand on I believe when the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard we've got to have a standard and the standard is his word and the word says come to church because that's where the preaching of the gospel is that's where the preaching of the mystery is what is the mystery it seems all very mysterious but you know if you go back to Colossians 1:26 27 you'll find out what the mystery is the mystery that has been hidden from ages and from ages and and is now revealed to the Gentiles but you know so many people fail to see what that mystery is and even a lot of times when the mystery is preached you don't have confidence in the ministry you don't have confidence in the word and your eyes are veiled over and you fail to see what the mystery is the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory the mystery is that God is in you that you are the fulfillment of the entire New Testament just like Jesus was the fulfillment of the Old Testament the life of Christ in you is the fulfillment of the New Testament and God is putting his life in you just like his life was in himself as he walked the shores of Galilee the life of God in the believers in the church and that life is what will give you confidence that life is what will take you in a rapture because God is going to take his own life in the rapture God is going to take his own word in the rapture and you have eaten the word and you have received it until you have become the word and that's why that's why you know many ministers they be there fighting against this thing that I don't need to come to church and it's not because we don't we're not balanced I'm so tired of hearing that we're not ballasts when I'll have a balanced view of it the reason is because we want people to see the mystery listen if you have these virtues you can see afar off and you can see what's happening in the church you can see what's taking place in the people's lives and you can see that there's a confidence lacking and usually there's something in you groaning and crying out believe God believe the Word of God allow God to have preeminence in your life so that this mystery can be unfolded in you the mystery is not God sent a prophet that's part of the mystery because God's had to send a prophet so that you could hear the prophets message the mystery is that God is in you you know you look back into the scripture and think about and I'm trying to close here y'all y'all bear with me just for a little bit longer I know it's Wednesday night but I believe that you travel for a long way to hear the word tonight and so my goal is to feed you a little bit well you read back in John chapter one when when the disciple there was two disciples with John the one that was to introduce the Son of Man there were two disciples with John and John said there goes the Son of Man one of them was Andrew and we don't know the name of the other and Andrew said whom there goes the son of man and he didn't he didn't just discard what the prophets said that's what everybody said the fivefold ministry is saying we know something more than then the elijah ministry no he turned to he turned to receive the son of man he turned after the son of man and you see that's the same thing that elijah has done in this day he brought a message to speak the word that the son of man would be made manifest again and if you just have your eyes still on the prophet I believe God sent a prophet and I intent we like we love to tell all the stories and we love to all the different things about God in that manifesting himself in the Prophet the visions but he preached a message he preached a message to reveal the Son of man and where is the Son of Man the Prophet is not on earth today and John was taken off the earth when the Son of Man was being revealed the Prophet is not on earth where is the Son of Man the Son of Man is in you the Son of Man is being revealed in you not just a particular man not just one individual preacher not just not just one individual person but the bride all around the world is the son of man God is revealing himself in you and that is the mystery that's the thing you'll miss by just sitting home and listening to the tapes and you might you'll say well now I hear now I know it but you've got to go through and experience your own self and that's what the fullest virgin do they wait until it's too late and then they go to get all in the lab but it's too late it's too late because the bride has already come through an experience they've already gone through a growth process they've already come through all of this building up time they've already come through receiving the son of man revelation they've struggled and they've strived to receive that capstone revelation so that that word could be produced in their lives oh god I hope it's not too late friends I hope it's not too late because so many have squandered this time and God now will turn he's turning and he's saying well you've been too lukewarm all this time you didn't you didn't get into the message you didn't struggle and strive you didn't receive it it's not about being balanced freedom it's about understanding the mystery of the day it's about understanding the mystery and you cannot receive the mystery I believe that if you look around and observe it as a parent they're just sitting home and tapes listening to tapes will not give you confidence in that mystery and maybe the maybe this will stir up controversy or whatever but I believe the old testing at Hebrews 11 the Hebrews 11 Saints were well a crack weighted with controversy Daniel was well acquainted with controversy when he threw his window when it was thrown in the lion's den the three Hebrew children were well-acquainted with controversy when they would not bow to the image of the Prophet they would not worship the Prophet they would not worship the image that had been erected because they knew their God they had confidence in their God and they had confidence in the revelation for their day I'm trying to wander i'ma just speak on a few more things because let's see that's what the statue of a perfect man is when God puts his confidence in you he wants you to realize that God is confident in you and he begins to work on you and give you trials and things as you grow up and and the grace of God and you begin to build one thing gets built on the other until God is looking at you and you see I I began to read scriptures or read quotes the things that brother have said about why gifts are not manifest in the church today do you realize the power that God has given us the power of the spoken word brother have said if God just unleashed every if he's like unleashed everything that was inhibiting you you could go create a world you could speak a world into existence and into existence you began to think that is a lot of power and before you give that kind of power to somebody before you let them have all that free reign and we'll talk about the gifts too before you let these gifts unloose in the Church of speaking in tongues of all these different things you want to make sure that the people know how to use it that they're nice and mature exactly because you don't you don't want to give a chainsaw into the hand of a little baby and have it running around cutting things or whatever but you want to make sure that they're confident first and so you got to test them and try them you got to put them through some things and that's what many times it's so hard about being a Christian as you you feel like maybe God has left you especially maybe out right after receiving the new birth just like when G when the spirit came upon Jesus on the River Jordan right after that he was he was into the wilderness being tempted by the devil just after God does something for you then he'll many times the devil begins to attack you and try you just after you believe her healing it seems like you're getting sicker all the time but just have confidence have faith in the Word of God and God will bring his word to pass and I'm gonna end right there cuz I know it's good late and everything I feel like I could probably go on for another two hours I don't want to scare anybody so go the musicians can go ahead and come forward but you know you know many times brother Brown talked about I'm just gonna finish on these as they come forward we already talked about how many times you you begin to stray away you begin to forget what your confidence is and he told that story of that down as Sydney as they were building that bridge that famous bridge over the Sydney Harbour and they look for different ones that could build it and finally they found a man that said I can do it but we got a dig we got a dig way and the way brother Brent said it we got it with dig way way way way way way down down all the way until they got to bedrock and that's how you find confidence is when you get when you get when you go home and you say well I'm just going to dig through all this stuff in my house I'm gonna at this time for a sanctified sanctifying it's time for a purging I'm getting rid of all the stuff that shouldn't be here and you dig down until you find confidence with God remember that story that brother Brian told about well it was in the Bible in 2nd Kings chapter 3 but there's three kings that way they went up against against I believe it was Moab and they went seven days seven days out into eat him out into the wilderness leaving and they and they ran out of water and they begin to they began to cry out for God is God gonna is God still able to deliver us and Jehoshaphat sent for the for the prophet Elijah and Elijah and Elisha came and he said he told him you know brother Branham the way brother Browns explains this and he said it was revealed to Elisha that the place where they were owned was the same place where when the Israelites were in Egypt the Moses had come down off of the off of the mountain and instead of smiting the children of Israel he smoked that rock and out from that rock came gushing water in that same place now they were and that out in the middle of the wilderness of eat up eat him and and Elijah began to tell them the prophet of God told him if you want water if you won't if you want to win this battle you got to dig and they began to dig they began to dig those dishes so you know many times in life you get to a place where you feel like you've been left alone that nobody loves you that nobody cares for you that God is left left you all alone you begin to lose confidence at the place where you are you begin to lose confidence that God is still on your side and brother round taught us the antidote for that the remedy for that is to begin to dig so let's begin to dig if you have something in your life it's time to get it out of the way dig so many times you've got a you got a dig you got to dig through the naysayers you got to dig through people who say well they're not preaching right you got to dig through all the things they're not believing right this those people are crazy to believe in a baptism of the Holy Ghost they're they're crazy to believe that God is still able to deliver and heal there's you got to dig through all that but that's how you get confidence Saints and I am confident in the Word of God and I'm confident in you I'm confident and the church that we have and I'm a believer I'm confident let's sing some songs let's worship Jesus is coming soon trouble sometimes [Music] [Applause] [Music] if

God for the for their children for their family and prayer and something began to move in them as they were praying and they began to cry out that God would would pull it their heart and begin to to the way that they were praying was that God would move upon their heart well you know the next day there was they were praying for two brothers what they were doing they were praying for two brothers then the next day these two brothers wound up they said they felt like their heart was being squeezed and they ran to the hospital because they thought they were having a heart attack something was going on and they began they began to get serious for God you know I'm not I'm not saying pray for for bad things to happen or whatever but if you put things into God's hands if you if you exercise your faith and confess to God forgetting to put your confession before God and say I believe your word I believe that you're still able to return the lost you're still able to patch up my home God
