[13:11] thank you for all your
[13:13] prayers we didn't have any trouble
[13:14] getting up there and didn't have any
[13:15] trouble getting back so really enjoyed
[13:16] that so let's turn our bibles to hebrews
[13:18] nine
[13:21] and continue on eternal redemption
[13:25] part 10. we were
[13:29] we were in kentucky
[13:33] i spoke on this same subject but kind of
[13:37] got into
[13:38] um predestination and foreign
[13:42] and there was really some good things
[13:44] brought out uh
[13:45] you know when you when you go somewhere
[13:47] as a preacher and they say you know
[13:49] good job and then they all just disperse
[13:51] and go in their white
[13:52] merry ways you know it's well we had a
[13:55] good time and
[13:56] see you later but uh we had time to
[13:58] fellowship and
[14:00] and one brother said i've never heard
[14:01] that preach as plain as you preached it
[14:04] was predestination he said he said
[14:06] people have made it so
[14:08] mysterious and so strange well pop knows
[14:11] that you know they make it so mysterious
[14:13] so strange
[14:14] that you can't understand it but if
[14:15] you'll just take it simply by the way we
[14:18] that we're preaching it here and brother
[14:19] dale's preaching it's just so simple
[14:22] that by four knowledge he knew
[14:23] everything that that's pretty much yeah
[14:26] by for knowledge you knew everything
[14:27] so then he could pre-determine
[14:31] what's going on
[14:34] by your desire
[14:37] he desired that all of us be saved he
[14:39] desired all of us to be up the statue of
[14:41] perfect man he desired everybody to be a
[14:42] christian
[14:44] but not everybody's going to because
[14:46] we're a free moral agent there's louise
[14:48] and christine so he's better
[14:50] there they are right there thank you
[14:53] lord for bringing them in so hebrews 9
[14:55] verse 11 and let's pray before we get
[14:57] started
[14:58] the heavenly father thank you for the
[15:00] day that you give us this hour that
[15:01] we're living in
[15:03] that we can understand you
[15:07] that we can lord you said by understand
[15:09] the mystery
[15:11] of this end time lord that all that will
[15:13] be made known
[15:15] to your people father we thank you for
[15:18] the word that we hear here father and we
[15:20] thank you for all the ministry here lord
[15:23] that speaks in this pulpit and around
[15:25] the world lord the true ministry the
[15:27] true bride of jesus christ we
[15:29] thank you for each one lord we pray that
[15:31] you'd heal the sick lord the ones among
[15:33] us that are not feeling well
[15:35] some have work to do father we know that
[15:37] that gets in the way sometimes
[15:39] the lord we know that you're the only
[15:40] one that can satisfy
[15:44] man has tried to satisfy this world from
[15:46] trying to make money and by this and by
[15:48] that but
[15:49] there's only one satisfaction that's in
[15:51] jesus christ
[15:53] and that's you lord the word so forgive
[15:55] us of our sins bless this day
[15:56] keep us and lead us and guide us by your
[15:58] holy spirit be
[16:00] us lord tonight with the storm coming in
[16:02] bad weather man says it's coming
[16:05] but lord we can say no that that thing
[16:08] can turn and go another direction
[16:10] and not come by here lord and cause any
[16:12] damage
[16:13] we pray for the ones that's already had
[16:15] damage there in mississippi and
[16:17] in alabama lord we pray that you'd touch
[16:19] each one they're we're human beings lord
[16:20] and we're at the mercy of this thing for
[16:22] our time being
[16:23] but lord you told us when we come up
[16:24] that statue of perfect man
[16:26] that we would come into speaking
[16:27] condition and we could lord
[16:29] do the things we need to do lord to get
[16:31] through and get by father just be with
[16:34] us
[16:34] fill us with your holy spirit give us
[16:36] revelation you do the speaking tonight
[16:38] father in jesus name we pray
[16:40] amen and also remember brother aaron too
[16:42] he's
[16:44] he's not sick sick but he's he hadn't he
[16:47] had a test and hadn't got it back yet so
[16:48] that's why he's not here tonight he's
[16:51] just kind of
[16:52] self-quarantining for a few days and uh
[16:55] and if he got his test results back and
[16:57] it had been negatory he'd be up here
[16:58] tonight
[17:00] all right so hebrews 9 11 but christ
[17:03] being coming high priest of good things
[17:04] to come by a greater and more perfect
[17:06] tabernacle
[17:07] not made with hands that is to say not
[17:09] of this building
[17:10] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[17:12] but by his own blood he entered into
[17:14] once into the holy place having obtained
[17:18] eternal redemption for us i hope that
[17:21] sinks in having obtained
[17:23] eternal redemption for us you may be
[17:26] seated in the lord's blessing
[17:28] to the reading of the word and we're
[17:29] going to read this quote again
[17:32] i know sometimes you know i was telling
[17:34] you brother claude now we're talking
[17:35] it takes takes 12 to 15 times for humans
[17:38] to read something to get comprehended so
[17:40] this is
[17:41] the plan part 10. so we're getting close
[17:43] to number 12.
[17:45] okay but redemption is one of the oldest
[17:48] things in the bible
[17:50] actually i don't want to add to what
[17:51] brother brown said it's the only thing
[17:53] that's in the bible
[17:55] redemption is coming from as far when we
[17:57] go to
[17:58] uh there had to be a covering before
[18:00] adam even came on the earth because what
[18:02] god by foreknowledge knew adam would
[18:04] fall
[18:05] god by foreign knowledge knew eve would
[18:06] fall god by foreign knew they would need
[18:08] a sacrifice before they even hit the
[18:10] earth
[18:12] so he had it there waiting on them and
[18:14] to me that's
[18:15] grace grace amazing grace
[18:19] that covered them for the sin that they
[18:21] did because it turned the whole world
[18:23] upside down and put us in chaos but yet
[18:26] god was right there and we'll see adam
[18:28] and eve one day and you know what i'm
[18:29] not going to go up to adam and eve and
[18:30] say why'd you do what you did
[18:32] no we're just going to rejoice and be
[18:34] happy that we made it
[18:35] amen so it's one of the oldest things in
[18:39] the bible did you know redemption was
[18:40] even the plan of redemption was laid out
[18:43] before the world was ever formed you
[18:45] know we've been talking about this this
[18:47] think of this god foreseeing and making
[18:48] a way of redemption before he even made
[18:50] the world
[18:51] now what happens is i was thinking
[18:54] yesterday
[18:55] we say god had a plan and god had a
[18:57] purpose
[18:58] that's good but who
[19:02] is it for and who is he going to use
[19:05] to get this plan going and get this plan
[19:07] in
[19:08] motion he's going to use human beings
[19:11] he's going to allow or
[19:13] let man fall so that his attributes can
[19:16] be made manifest
[19:17] that was his plan because for seeing
[19:21] he could see and then his dad and i were
[19:23] kind of briefly last night talking that
[19:25] there is a predetermined destiny for
[19:28] certain things
[19:29] and he's been covering that he covered
[19:31] it sunday there's a
[19:32] there's going to have to be a fivefold
[19:35] ministry
[19:36] it doesn't name every prophet pastor
[19:38] teacher evangelist
[19:40] but it says you must have apostles
[19:42] prophet pastor's eastern evangelist
[19:44] to perfect the saints so that is a
[19:47] predetermined
[19:48] preset there had to be seven church age
[19:51] messengers
[19:52] there had to be an update of pentecost
[19:56] there had to be jesus physically dying
[19:59] on those things had to happen
[20:03] that was predetermined and cannot change
[20:06] what you and i have to do is you and i
[20:08] have to connect
[20:09] ourselves to that see that's our choice
[20:13] here it is moses
[20:17] told the children of israel he said this
[20:19] day
[20:20] choose you this day who you will serve
[20:24] and they had to make a choice because
[20:26] they had this list of things that if
[20:28] they did this is
[20:29] what god was going to bless them and
[20:31] then there was a list in deuteronomy
[20:32] of the things that if they didn't do it
[20:34] they were going to get this curse
[20:36] amen so it was laid out pretty well for
[20:38] them
[20:39] because you and i though we see by the
[20:41] baptism of the holy ghost
[20:44] that we don't do away with the ten
[20:45] commandments we don't do away with all
[20:46] the things that happen in the old
[20:48] testament
[20:48] but they have to be used as tights
[20:50] because listen we
[20:52] we're surely not going god's not going
[20:54] to make us go out and marry a prostitute
[20:57] but he used that as an example in the
[21:00] old testament
[21:01] under the blood of bulls and ghosts i
[21:03] want you to remember something because
[21:04] this plan of redemption
[21:06] actually contains the blood of bulls and
[21:08] goats
[21:09] because without that gap in between
[21:11] there they would have just been lost
[21:15] there would have been nobody saved
[21:17] that's what we were talking about
[21:18] this weekend and and like my brother
[21:20] richard hyatt he was
[21:21] we were talking about uh nobody being
[21:24] saved
[21:25] or having the baptism of the holy ghost
[21:28] the new birth in the old testament
[21:30] he agreed and he liked the way that we
[21:32] brought it out because
[21:33] they had the holy ghost now listen you
[21:35] can't reject that john
[21:38] the bible says john had the holy ghost
[21:41] but it never said john had the new birth
[21:44] you said that's the same no they're not
[21:46] right
[21:47] you can have the baptism of the holy
[21:49] ghost every day of your life
[21:51] on your spirit and die and go to hell
[21:52] but you can never have the new birth
[21:56] and die and go to hell if you have the
[21:58] new birth you don't you got free ticket
[22:00] to glory
[22:01] but you can have the holy ghost you can
[22:02] have pete and ice was anointed by the
[22:04] holy ghost
[22:06] balaam was anointed by the holy ghost
[22:10] amen there was a donkey anointed by the
[22:13] holy ghost one time
[22:15] amen but now in the end well that's not
[22:18] going to happen now because god has
[22:19] honed it down to me and you
[22:22] jesus came to not save the donkey
[22:25] he came to save the human right and then
[22:28] he would take his
[22:29] holy ghost and put it into that human
[22:32] and i was reading back here a few
[22:34] minutes ago brother madam was talking
[22:35] about
[22:36] you know he says i don't believe in
[22:37] transmigration or or all these different
[22:39] things of
[22:40] of the soul and then he talks about soul
[22:42] sleeping and we may get to that if we
[22:43] don't we'll get to it next wednesday
[22:45] where you're a smith believed that you
[22:47] know when you died you stayed
[22:48] there in the ground you that's where you
[22:50] lay
[22:51] that's what they call it soul sleeping
[22:54] when you die that's where you lay you're
[22:56] there your soul your consciousness and
[22:57] everything is in that
[22:58] is in the grave no no that's not true we
[23:01] know that that's why i'm covering these
[23:03] dimensions because
[23:04] god had to set these dimensions up
[23:06] before the foundation of the world
[23:08] now they were empty some of them
[23:12] but they were empty at a time but as
[23:14] soon as
[23:15] abel died and as soon as cain died and
[23:18] as soon as all these people started
[23:20] dying
[23:20] god had to have a place to set each and
[23:23] every one of them
[23:24] because he didn't he has never ever
[23:28] ever since he created a soul he has
[23:31] never to this day
[23:33] destroyed one never to this day
[23:37] you heard what i said never to this day
[23:38] as he destroyed a soul
[23:40] he has put that soul somewhere
[23:43] so that's how much he thinks of that
[23:45] soul like we were talking about and saw
[23:46] where brother brown
[23:47] said now hell's not burning
[23:50] because they've not been judged yet you
[23:53] say well now look with me and you
[23:54] when me and you look at that we say yeah
[23:57] i think they've already been judged
[23:58] but you and i we were talking about this
[24:00] weekend you never know when somebody's
[24:02] right on their deathbed and they say god
[24:04] forgive me
[24:06] you're not if you're not there you don't
[24:07] know so i like what brother richard high
[24:09] said he said let god judge him
[24:11] you quit judging him he said just forget
[24:13] it what are you gonna what are you gonna
[24:15] do
[24:16] you can't bring them back we will read
[24:18] here in a minute where
[24:19] where even the rich young ruler asked
[24:22] abraham he said
[24:25] can i get back and tell my brothers
[24:29] to not come to this place and basically
[24:31] abraham said
[24:34] even though they get you ra we could
[24:36] raise you god could raise you from the
[24:37] dead
[24:38] they're not going to believe it anyway
[24:39] because they didn't believe it to start
[24:40] with god's already sent him a provision
[24:42] he already sent him the bosom of abraham
[24:44] he already sent them
[24:46] prophets and look at what the rich young
[24:48] ruler he turned jesus christ down
[24:50] himself
[24:53] okay and he was sent to hell
[24:56] where he's still waiting right now and
[24:58] that's the whole thing wherever
[25:00] they are they've been there for a while
[25:02] they can't pass through something
[25:04] they can't migrate over here they can't
[25:06] get better
[25:07] once they leave no this is your time
[25:10] i was thinking the other day and whether
[25:12] we get to this or not i'm going to bring
[25:14] this point out but look god is standing
[25:15] back and looking
[25:17] and we see people that are that doesn't
[25:19] make it to the age of accountability
[25:22] god knew that he knew the
[25:25] heart of that person so he could put and
[25:28] thank god he sent us a prophet to say
[25:29] all babies go to heaven
[25:32] because they can't be judged because
[25:34] there's nothing to judge him for because
[25:35] jesus christ
[25:36] is the one that is the righteous judge
[25:39] and all he's going to do he's going to
[25:41] say hey
[25:41] they didn't make it to the to the age of
[25:44] accountability they didn't know any
[25:45] better how many
[25:46] how many billions of babies have been
[25:48] born in this world that's going to
[25:49] heaven because they died before
[25:51] i was just reading in joshua this
[25:53] morning in my scripture reading
[25:55] where joshua went into one of those
[25:57] cities and
[25:58] and killed everything that had breath it
[26:00] said so it had to be women children men
[26:02] and god told him to do that okay see
[26:05] that's hard for us to
[26:06] to realize that god told him to do that
[26:10] but that was under the blood of bulls
[26:12] and goats and that was the thing that he
[26:13] told joshua
[26:14] what to do his commission was was to
[26:16] drive all the people out
[26:18] well he he didn't want some of them
[26:19] driven out he wants some of them done
[26:21] away with
[26:23] amen but you see all baby how many
[26:25] countless babies has been since then
[26:27] though that is
[26:28] that have died that are going to be
[26:30] there somewhere now
[26:32] look at what happened to sharon rose and
[26:34] that's one thing you look at when
[26:36] when the brother branham walks by in
[26:37] that vision he sees that grown woman
[26:40] so you see sharon rose died as what
[26:42] six-month-old baby
[26:44] but when she went across the curtain of
[26:45] time she wasn't a six-month-old baby she
[26:47] was an 18 year old girl
[26:49] see that was already fixed in god's mind
[26:53] he predetermined that but he saw that
[26:56] she would pass away he saw that the
[26:58] prophet would do what he did
[27:00] he saw that sharon rose would pass away
[27:02] and he had a provision waiting for her
[27:04] see sometimes we so narrowly think that
[27:07] well we're the only people in the world
[27:09] i was thinking yesterday when i was
[27:11] reading or this morning when i was
[27:12] reading the book of joshua
[27:14] it's told of all those different cities
[27:16] that had hundreds of thousands of people
[27:18] sometimes we just hone in and say what
[27:20] nothing but the jews in the old
[27:21] testament the children of israel
[27:23] now this world was being populated and
[27:25] they were moving and they were
[27:26] they were building kingdoms and they
[27:28] were setting up things but
[27:30] israel was his chosen and he told israel
[27:34] he said wherever you put the soul joshua
[27:36] wherever you go
[27:37] i'm going to bless you and then you
[27:39] place the people
[27:41] in that promised land but he had there
[27:43] had to be a slaughter
[27:46] there has to be a slaughter for us to go
[27:47] up the statue of a perfect man
[27:49] there has to isn't a bloody affair i
[27:51] told a church there the other night i
[27:53] said look
[27:55] it's real strange that the prince of
[27:57] peace
[27:59] stood one day and said i didn't come to
[28:01] bring peace
[28:04] i came to bring a sword i came to bring
[28:07] a division
[28:09] the prince of peace said that it's hard
[28:11] for us to believe but once you get the
[28:12] baptism of the holy ghost you'll believe
[28:14] it
[28:14] and you'll know that that's what's
[28:15] happening is that you and i what we're
[28:17] fighting our way to heaven
[28:19] amen it's not a picnic it's a battle
[28:24] amen titus 1 verse 1
[28:28] that he promised this eternal life which
[28:30] god that cannot lie promised before the
[28:31] world began
[28:34] paul is very clear here but half in due
[28:36] times manifested his word through
[28:38] preaching
[28:39] which is committed unto me according to
[28:41] the commandment of god our savior
[28:43] as i said before you might get born
[28:46] again
[28:47] by pressing play but you will not become
[28:49] a full-grown
[28:50] christian by just listening to tapes
[28:53] because that's what the bible tells us
[28:55] that the perfecting of the saints
[28:58] is under a five-fold predestinated
[29:01] ministry
[29:02] that has to happen it's got to happen
[29:05] you know why it's got to happen you see
[29:07] there you see
[29:08] why that has to happen because he knew
[29:10] you needed it
[29:13] he knew i had to sit under a ministry i
[29:15] was thinking yesterday and i
[29:16] i just want to make this statement you
[29:18] know i get in trouble for making
[29:19] statements anyway so i'm going to make
[29:20] it
[29:22] i see all the people we were talking
[29:26] this weekend
[29:27] about all the people fell away from the
[29:29] message
[29:30] and i just want to make this statement
[29:32] you know you you look at some of the
[29:34] people and i don't call names because
[29:35] everybody knows who's left the message
[29:37] we ain't gotta
[29:38] you gotta post it but look what they had
[29:41] great anointings
[29:43] they could preach like a house on fire
[29:45] on a windy day
[29:46] they could run the islands they had
[29:48] people running the aisles they had
[29:49] congregations running the aisles they
[29:52] had them shouting and screaming and
[29:53] speaking
[29:54] in tongues
[29:57] and they're living in adultery
[30:00] denying the message so what's that got
[30:04] us
[30:06] it takes a five-fold ministry
[30:09] people can't sit and listen to a pastor
[30:11] they want to go to this one and go to
[30:13] that one
[30:13] they want church hop and go to this and
[30:15] go to this one
[30:16] nobody ever wants to hear a teacher
[30:18] because they're boring
[30:21] but i thought you know when jesus during
[30:23] his whole life
[30:25] during his whole life i don't think he
[30:26] ever raised his voice much
[30:29] except when he was at the tomb of
[30:30] lazarus he cried with a loud voice and
[30:32] said
[30:32] lives was come forth but every time he
[30:34] dealt with a demon he was as calm as a
[30:36] cucumber
[30:38] you know why because he had control he
[30:41] knew
[30:41] he had virtue or strength and brother
[30:44] brown the same way how many times have
[30:45] you ever heard him raise his voice in a
[30:47] prayer line
[30:49] ever no i've never heard him raise his
[30:51] voice in a prayer line
[30:52] he talks so that's what the problem is
[30:55] have we shouted this thing out you know
[30:57] we just shouted all all we're doing is
[30:59] just shouting and
[31:00] screaming and speaking in tongues and
[31:01] hey that's okay that's good
[31:05] but when you come down here and you go
[31:08] out monday
[31:10] what have you heard on sunday that you
[31:12] felt good and it was all good and this
[31:14] was great and
[31:15] i had cause i and you know what sunday
[31:17] afternoon after we finished the service
[31:20] we sang for what jim another 20 minutes
[31:22] after i preached or even 30 minutes
[31:23] because the spirit of the lord was in
[31:25] the building nobody was shouting but you
[31:26] could just see people weeping
[31:28] and they were just so calmly just
[31:30] praising the lord and we just never
[31:31] couldn't stop the service and
[31:33] afterwards and and you know me i wasn't
[31:35] running the aisles i mean i slammed my
[31:37] fist down every once in a while just to
[31:38] get them awake like y'all are asleep now
[31:41] but um i'll go get some toothpicks or
[31:44] something put them in your ear or stick
[31:46] a toothpick somewhere else
[31:48] stay awake but uh
[31:54] i told them i said you know that's
[31:55] that's the way it ought to be
[31:58] i said oh it ought to be you ought to
[32:00] bring the word of god and then if that
[32:01] spirit falls
[32:03] speaking in tongues shouting that's okay
[32:05] but what about just a calm spirit that
[32:07] comes over the building
[32:09] and people just kind of you know they
[32:11] just praise the lord
[32:12] amen for about 30 minutes couldn't stop
[32:14] the service brother richard just kept
[32:16] saying he said hey
[32:17] this is feeling good up here so we you
[32:18] understand what i mean and i'm not
[32:20] saying anything against that
[32:21] we got to have it but there's five parts
[32:23] to it
[32:25] everybody loves an evangelist and that's
[32:28] okay because an evangelist is all up
[32:30] you know and that's okay but you know
[32:31] what he's got to leave but the pastor
[32:34] and the teacher and the different ones
[32:35] and the prophets and the apostles
[32:37] they have to live with the people they
[32:40] have to live with the problems and the
[32:41] issues and all the things that go on
[32:44] and what are we doing with it are we as
[32:46] brother brown said one time tooting it
[32:48] out to whistle
[32:50] we've been around 60 years and what has
[32:52] that got us
[32:55] because i believe the words that when we
[32:57] come to the end time standing on the
[32:59] word 100
[33:00] is going to get you further than you're
[33:02] shouting and speaking in tongues
[33:04] and all those different things because
[33:06] the devil can impersonate
[33:08] everything but the revealing of the word
[33:11] he cannot replace oh yeah he can try but
[33:15] he can never that's why
[33:17] that brother else just we were coming
[33:19] down the road
[33:20] coming down the road monday and june and
[33:22] i were you know how you get aggravated
[33:24] when something starts buffering right
[33:26] you're getting this we were in the car
[33:28] coming down the road and we weren't
[33:29] getting good cell service and
[33:31] dad would speak about four sentences and
[33:34] then it would start buffering
[33:36] well june and i looked at each other and
[33:38] i said that bother you and she said
[33:39] no not really i said me either i said it
[33:41] gives me time to think in between
[33:44] the four sentences he said and then
[33:46] there's about a minute in there that
[33:47] it's buffering and i'm trying to say i'm
[33:48] thinking what he said so that that
[33:49] worked out pretty good
[33:51] so from now what we're going to do is
[33:52] we're going to speak four sentences
[33:54] no kidding we'll be here six
[33:57] hours but i'll guarantee you'll get more
[33:58] than you get now
[34:02] but that's just the way we are as humans
[34:04] though because you only process so much
[34:05] we know that
[34:07] and we can only endure so much and i
[34:09] know that but
[34:10] it's the word bottom line
[34:14] it's the revealing of the word that's
[34:16] predestinated somebody will come to it
[34:19] because there will be a perfecting of
[34:21] the saints
[34:23] and somebody see then what you got to do
[34:25] though is you got to connect yourself to
[34:27] that
[34:27] right this is the eternal part this is
[34:29] the predestinated part
[34:30] but you got to connect yourself to it
[34:32] because you're going to make a choice
[34:34] amen so now let's read ephesians
[34:38] 1 and let's start with verse 3. blessed
[34:40] be the god and father my lord jesus
[34:42] christ who has blessed us with all
[34:43] spiritual blessings
[34:45] and heavenly places in christ according
[34:47] as he has chosen us
[34:49] in him before the foundation of the
[34:51] world how many times has
[34:52] brother dale and i've been telling you
[34:54] we don't want to be chosen by him
[34:56] because everybody was chosen by god
[34:59] he knew every person would be on this
[35:01] earth he knew what adolf hitler would do
[35:03] when he got here and all the different
[35:04] ones so they were
[35:05] they were chosen they were men you're
[35:08] called if you were chosen
[35:10] we understand that but that before the
[35:12] foundation of the world look though
[35:13] but look at this one group of people
[35:15] that we should be holy and without blame
[35:17] so that does away with a lot of people
[35:20] right i dazzle away with a lot of
[35:22] spirits and a lot of
[35:23] denominational ideas and that does away
[35:25] a lot of our ideas
[35:27] but see it says that we should be holy
[35:30] and without blame before him
[35:33] in love if you have the baptism of holy
[35:35] ghost today
[35:36] you are blameless and you are the holy
[35:39] righteous
[35:40] bride of jesus christ now that's what he
[35:43] sees
[35:44] now the devil don't see that but look
[35:47] having predestinated us
[35:49] into adoption so see there's another
[35:52] thing
[35:53] adoption is not a maybe
[35:57] we might there might be a group get to
[36:00] it
[36:01] no that's what struck me coming down the
[36:04] road
[36:04] having predestined now see that is a
[36:07] predetermined destiny
[36:09] now we know it's all about foreknowledge
[36:11] but still there's things that are set in
[36:13] stone
[36:14] there's going to be an adopted group of
[36:16] people
[36:17] because peter said add to your faith
[36:19] virtue virtue knowledge knowledge
[36:20] temperament temperature patience
[36:22] patience godliness godliness brother
[36:23] kindness and love and then it took a
[36:25] prophet of god to put all this together
[36:27] to tell us
[36:28] that you and i needed to go up a statue
[36:30] of a perfect man
[36:31] that you and i needed to go up this
[36:34] stature of a
[36:35] perfect man in the end time
[36:38] so there is a predestination when
[36:40] brother branham was sitting
[36:42] in the woods and he started drawing
[36:44] remember he come the lord came to him
[36:46] and he
[36:47] made all the drawings and preached the
[36:48] stature of a perfect man
[36:50] he said he'd never seen it like that
[36:51] before and what a revelation
[36:54] well that was a predestinated time that
[36:55] god knew that that prophet would be
[36:57] there
[36:58] he knew he would have a mouthpiece so he
[37:01] brought the word to the mouthpiece now
[37:02] listen
[37:03] he didn't bring that he didn't bring
[37:06] that to brother brown in 1957.
[37:08] he didn't bring that to brother roman in
[37:10] 1947. he didn't bring that to him in
[37:12] about 1959
[37:15] he brought it to him when brother
[37:17] branham could preach it to us
[37:19] that he had went up that statue of a
[37:20] perfect man and god had given those
[37:23] gifts to him
[37:26] to bring it to me in you and to bring it
[37:29] to me and you was that was his job
[37:32] his j listen his job was not for him to
[37:35] just go up that
[37:36] that's your perfect man his job was not
[37:38] just for god to perfect him
[37:40] his job was not that god was going to
[37:43] bring him back to perfect us
[37:49] he's not going to bring brother brown
[37:50] back to perfect us
[37:52] he gave us a predestinated plan
[37:56] that did not include a prophet coming
[37:59] back into this dimension
[38:02] show me one show me one you say oh no no
[38:05] no samuel no wait a minute that's old
[38:07] testament
[38:08] you can't bring up souls from the sixth
[38:11] dimension now
[38:12] you can't do that they're there listen
[38:16] they don't want to come back here yet
[38:18] right
[38:20] they don't death is still raining here
[38:23] death doesn't rain over there brother
[38:24] brown said have i got to go back
[38:28] that was his whole thing that thing's
[38:31] laying down there
[38:32] i know it he you know what he had his
[38:34] faculty he knew if he got back in that
[38:36] body
[38:36] he was gonna die so he said can i stay
[38:39] here no you gotta go back
[38:42] it's not your time yet having
[38:44] predestinated us into adoption
[38:46] so everybody that's born again according
[38:50] to romans 8 we all
[38:51] receive the spirit of adoption when we
[38:54] get born again where we
[38:55] cry abba father or daddy daddy what you
[38:58] cry because you're a baby
[39:00] but now as we grow up in the statue of a
[39:03] perfect man
[39:05] we should not be crying anymore we
[39:07] should not be having a
[39:08] toll to go to church or told to get here
[39:10] on time or total
[39:11] you know do the things we're supposed to
[39:12] do it should be automatic
[39:18] there's a lot of things that the world
[39:21] does that
[39:22] they do it so many times that it's just
[39:24] repetition until it just becomes second
[39:26] nature
[39:28] so what's our problem what's our problem
[39:31] as christians
[39:34] i mean i know when i get up tomorrow
[39:35] morning i know that i got 380
[39:38] mailboxes they don't move people do
[39:41] sometime
[39:43] but i know almost brother donny i can
[39:45] close my eyes and almost now i can throw
[39:46] them in the slot that need to go in
[39:50] well now if you can do that because of
[39:51] repetition
[39:53] then why can't you do the same thing or
[39:54] repetition of the gospel
[39:58] why can't you do where you can where you
[40:00] can open and
[40:01] you don't have to be able to quote every
[40:03] scripture but you know what
[40:04] if you start talking about the lord and
[40:06] the scripture pops in your mind
[40:08] it's in that bible somewhere it didn't
[40:10] just come from over here in
[40:11] greer's almanac it came from the bible
[40:14] but you know what
[40:15] if you never read the bible
[40:18] prime example june's dad good man
[40:21] good man walking shoe leather wonderful
[40:24] man
[40:24] but he's never read the bible he said oh
[40:26] he might have read it a long time ago so
[40:27] how can i talk to him i was talking to
[40:29] him about the bible
[40:30] he didn't know anything about the bible
[40:32] he just knows that there was a jesus and
[40:34] there he came and died and and all the
[40:36] different things and the moses and all
[40:38] the
[40:38] little stories that was told why it's
[40:41] not repetition because he's not opened
[40:42] the book
[40:44] he's not read the prescribed
[40:48] reading because listen this was
[40:51] predestinated before the foundation of
[40:52] the world
[40:54] written because of foreknowledge though
[40:57] but he wrote this
[40:58] and guess what when he sent it down to
[41:00] us it's so
[41:02] sure it never changes
[41:05] will never change well is what we're
[41:08] talking about brother richard now we
[41:09] this thing's this thing's just gonna
[41:11] this is just this is so
[41:13] limited but when we get to glory
[41:17] this is not gonna this is going to go
[41:19] away you're not going to see bibles
[41:22] oh yeah you might see them as a
[41:23] testimony or as a memorial
[41:27] but what are you going to see you're
[41:29] going to see us
[41:31] living epistles that's what god listen
[41:35] from the beginning if there had not been
[41:37] a fall there wouldn't have been a bible
[41:44] but there was and we need one
[41:47] there was a fall and we need a bible we
[41:50] need a guideline we need a guidepost we
[41:52] need these things to tell us
[41:54] what to do and let's not do them
[41:57] begrudgingly but do them
[41:59] for the glory of the lord have you even
[42:02] predestinated us into the adoption of
[42:03] children verse five we're not going to
[42:04] get anywhere tonight but that's okay
[42:06] we'll
[42:07] get as far as we can to stop according
[42:10] to the good pleasure of his will
[42:13] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[42:15] where he hath made us
[42:16] accepted in the beloved in whom we have
[42:20] what redemption
[42:22] through his blood the forgiveness of
[42:23] sins according to the riches of his
[42:26] grace
[42:27] wherein he has to bound it toward us in
[42:28] all wisdom and prudence now watch
[42:30] having made known unto us the mystery of
[42:32] his will there's the key
[42:35] now this plan is not so mysterious that
[42:39] we can't understand it
[42:40] if it was he's not a righteous judge
[42:44] and he's not a good daddy
[42:47] why would i want to give josh this
[42:48] mysterious book to get to this
[42:51] place and and say man you just got to
[42:53] figure it out
[42:54] no give him the give him the book
[42:58] that's what we were given now what what
[43:00] man has done to it has made it
[43:02] mysterious
[43:04] but having made known unto us the
[43:06] mystery of his will so there's a
[43:08] there's for that fivefold ministry
[43:09] that's where that predestinated it's
[43:12] going to come
[43:13] right you got to decide whether you want
[43:15] to hear it or not you got to decide
[43:17] whether you want to sit here you got to
[43:18] decide whether you want to
[43:19] listen to this or listen to that that's
[43:21] your choice having made known unto us
[43:23] the mystery of his will
[43:25] not our will his will according to his
[43:28] good pleasure which he has purposed
[43:31] in himself look that in the dispensation
[43:33] of the fullness of times
[43:35] which is now he might gather together in
[43:37] one
[43:38] all things in christ both which are in
[43:41] heaven
[43:42] and which are on earth even in him in
[43:44] whom also we have obtained an
[43:46] inheritance
[43:47] look being predestinated according to
[43:49] what
[43:50] being predestinated according to the
[43:52] purpose
[43:53] the plan and purpose was to have
[43:56] children
[43:57] that were going to have a no spot no
[44:00] wrinkle
[44:00] they were going to be his children and
[44:03] his
[44:04] wife not so much
[44:08] the church because it took a profit to
[44:12] tell us one day that
[44:13] this is talking about the church and
[44:16] this is what they get
[44:17] and this is talking about the bride and
[44:19] this is what she gets
[44:20] now sometimes it overlaps
[44:24] but when you come down to wife and
[44:27] church
[44:28] two different things way too different
[44:31] things
[44:32] because remember the church has their
[44:35] self out
[44:37] the bride of jesus christ is virgin
[44:39] stays virgin will be virgin all the way
[44:41] through
[44:42] amen that's why brother brown god won't
[44:44] touch brother brown said i know why i
[44:46] hate that
[44:47] organization i hate that denomination
[44:49] why it's a prostitute spirit
[44:52] it's the spirit of prostitution
[44:59] in whom also we have obtained an
[45:00] inheritance being predestinated
[45:02] according to the purpose of him who
[45:04] worketh all things
[45:05] after the counsel of his own will
[45:11] says we know that all things work
[45:12] together for good to them that love god
[45:14] to them that are be called thee called
[45:17] not a call
[45:18] be called according to his purpose for
[45:21] whom he did for no he also did
[45:23] predestinate
[45:24] to be conformed what he predestinated
[45:27] somebody to be
[45:28] conformed to the image of his son there
[45:31] he did
[45:32] predetermine there was going to be he
[45:35] was going to die for the
[45:37] world and then someone is going to have
[45:41] to accept that
[45:42] right because there's no other way and
[45:46] that's the predestinated part
[45:48] and he also did predestinate he also did
[45:51] predestinate what
[45:52] to be conformed to the image of his son
[45:54] that he might be the firstborn
[45:57] among many brethren moreover whom he did
[45:59] predestinate
[46:01] are predetermined then he also called
[46:03] whom he called he justified and whom he
[46:05] justified
[46:06] then he also glorified
[46:09] then the rest of the scripture says so
[46:10] what can we say if god be for us
[46:13] who can be who can be against us they
[46:16] ma'am so look and the brother of him
[46:17] says the word predestinate that's not a
[46:18] good word to use i know we're hammering
[46:20] this but
[46:20] if you'll ever get for knowledge and
[46:22] predestination you'll understand as we
[46:24] were talking about sunday
[46:26] you'll understand what brother brown
[46:27] says you always were eternal because
[46:29] there was
[46:30] i i had pulled some quotes for brother
[46:32] brown so you always were weak
[46:36] now wait a minute i'm fixing to read you
[46:38] one right there number three
[46:40] says how can i take a cuckoo bird and
[46:42] make a grain of wheat out of it that was
[46:43] my question to those in
[46:44] in kentucky but you can give me any
[46:48] quote in
[46:49] almost by by knowledge i can find you
[46:52] one real quick that sounds contrary
[46:56] brother brown comes up one day and says
[46:57] let's stand up and address the third
[46:59] person of the trinity
[47:00] well he wasn't addressing his third
[47:02] person he was addressing their third
[47:04] person
[47:05] because he only had one person but he
[47:08] was talking to a group of people
[47:10] mixed multitude so he had to say those
[47:12] things sometimes
[47:14] and then he would come in and he would
[47:15] look like paul right there in ephesus
[47:17] now the ephesians could swallow what i
[47:20] was just reading to you
[47:22] to a degree but he didn't say that to
[47:26] the corinthians
[47:28] because they were messed up but the
[47:30] ephesians had done what
[47:32] they had grown in grace and knowledge
[47:34] they had grown under paul
[47:36] so paul could tell them according you
[47:38] have chosen us in him before the
[47:39] foundational world having predestinated
[47:41] us into adoption of children
[47:43] they understood what he said when we see
[47:45] that in
[47:46] in some of the terms of what comes in
[47:47] the message is it's just
[47:49] predetermined it doesn't matter what i
[47:50] do
[47:53] i always was wheat well
[47:59] read the next one think number three
[48:02] please
[48:04] how can i take a huckleberry and make a
[48:06] grain of wheat out of it
[48:07] it's impossible for me to do it see he's
[48:09] explaining that brother ryan's
[48:10] explaining
[48:11] it's impossible for him to do that it's
[48:14] impossible for me to go out and plant my
[48:16] taters the other day
[48:17] that's t-a-t-e-r-s for those of you
[48:19] don't understand
[48:21] to others that's potators but i went out
[48:23] and planted my taters the other day now
[48:25] i'm not expecting for okra to come up
[48:28] because i planted taters right but now
[48:31] if god
[48:32] by transforming power that he has and
[48:35] nobody else does
[48:37] if he wanted to make it an okra
[48:40] he could do it just like me and you but
[48:43] we must yield ourself
[48:46] the only way it can be is because inside
[48:48] the kookaburra
[48:49] has been transmitted
[48:53] so in other words it had to come from
[48:54] somewhere when you transmit
[48:57] when you transmit a radio signal you
[48:59] have to have a base
[49:01] and you have to have a receiver right
[49:04] if you don't have a base the receiver is
[49:07] not going to get it
[49:08] and if you if you just have a base with
[49:11] no receiver
[49:12] nobody's going to get it so you have to
[49:14] have both
[49:16] you have to have the foreknowledge and
[49:18] the pre-determining
[49:19] but the foreknowledge first from the
[49:21] base and then by four knowledge
[49:23] i can pick up that this cup i was a
[49:27] cuckolar
[49:28] i'm still a cuckolder on the outside
[49:33] but on the inside there's been a
[49:35] transformation or
[49:37] not a soul transfer he didn't
[49:40] he didn't just move the cuckoo bear over
[49:42] and put the weed in
[49:45] he took the life
[49:50] has been transmitted from a cuckoo bird
[49:51] wheat now listen what he says a cuckoo
[49:53] bird to a germ called
[49:55] wheat life then you bury that kuckerberg
[49:58] and it'll produce a grain of wheat now
[49:59] only god can do that
[50:01] same way with me and you because there
[50:04] has been a
[50:05] life a life
[50:08] of wheat put in that cuckoo bird
[50:14] because there has been a life of wheat
[50:16] put in the cucumber
[50:18] not just realize you always were wheat
[50:22] but now look see where you got it you
[50:24] got to take the other quote though where
[50:26] brother brown said you always were
[50:27] eternal you always were wheat
[50:29] in the mind of god when he said let's go
[50:33] back in the back part of god's mind
[50:35] that is a whole different ballgame than
[50:37] being here on the earth
[50:39] if i may use that word ball game but
[50:41] it's a whole different thing
[50:43] because in the mind of god we are all
[50:45] eternal
[50:46] that genesis 1 26 man never fail
[50:50] never never fail
[50:56] you did but it didn't
[51:00] so that was always was a germ of wheat
[51:04] but it was transmitted or transferred on
[51:07] the day that you asked god to save your
[51:09] soul
[51:10] and to receive the new birth transmitted
[51:14] a life of wheat put in the cuckober
[51:17] right right and the life of the cucumber
[51:20] has been taken out
[51:24] what do you mean that old life you used
[51:26] to live
[51:28] same hand same mouth all the things you
[51:30] used to do when you were doing
[51:32] sinning in the world you still got them
[51:36] amen still got the kuckelber
[51:39] but it's been washed it's been
[51:41] sanctified
[51:43] and the life of the cuckoo bird has been
[51:44] taken out but the nature of the cuckover
[51:47] i was trying to
[51:48] we were explaining this sunday the
[51:50] nature of the cuckoo bird is still
[51:51] sticky now remember
[51:53] that's not talking about your soul
[51:55] that's right
[51:57] talk about your spirit realm memory
[52:00] reason conscious effects imagination
[52:01] because that's my problem now and my
[52:03] other problem is
[52:04] i don't let that eternal thing that's
[52:06] inside of me do a lot of work
[52:11] i'm just going to admit it but see look
[52:14] you can wound you wise you will all you
[52:15] want to with this quote as long as
[52:17] you're in this line
[52:19] you're going to be sticky and have a
[52:22] carnal nature
[52:24] that's going to bother you as long as
[52:25] you live but inside me somewhere
[52:29] i'm born again no
[52:34] as long as i'm in his life i'm sticky
[52:40] and i got a carnal nature now look it
[52:42] says carnal nature not carnal mind
[52:46] you had a carnal mind when you were in
[52:47] the world you're supposed to have the
[52:49] mind of christ when you get the new
[52:51] birth
[52:52] that's our problem is we're not getting
[52:53] a lot of new births
[52:55] we're getting anointings we're getting
[52:57] whoa and not a lot of sitting down and
[52:59] listening to really
[53:01] what god is saying to us
[53:07] but you have a carnal nature because why
[53:09] you can remember what you used to do
[53:12] you know where you did it at you still
[53:14] got the same eyeballs
[53:16] you still got the same brain human brain
[53:19] that tells you yeah
[53:20] you used to do that right over there
[53:22] remember you
[53:24] but you know what but inside of you
[53:27] you're born again
[53:31] that part's got to separate somewhere
[53:34] that's why i said when you're born again
[53:35] your soul is in another dimension
[53:37] it's in you it's not over there
[53:39] somewhere don't get me wrong
[53:40] but it's it's contrary to everything
[53:43] that's in this dimension
[53:46] everything that's right think about it
[53:49] you're all the soul that you were
[53:53] you weren't contrary to the world you
[53:55] did what they did
[53:56] right and you did it willingly
[54:00] but when god took the willingness out or
[54:02] the willing thing out
[54:05] you still got memories and conscious
[54:07] affection imagination a carnal nature
[54:10] that's going to bother you as long as
[54:12] you live but the inside of you you're
[54:13] born again and when you're raised up
[54:15] you're in the likeness of christ and all
[54:16] the sin is what
[54:18] gone from you that's the thing
[54:24] pray and read your bible
[54:27] that's the thing pray and read your
[54:30] bible
[54:32] how are we going to get free from this
[54:34] pray and read your bible but i want to
[54:35] add one thing
[54:38] you've got to have the correct
[54:39] interpretation of the bible
[54:42] you can't just read the bible because
[54:44] people read about listen there's some
[54:45] sincere people in the world that read
[54:46] the bible every day read me
[54:48] read more than you do but what do they
[54:51] read it with denominational eyes
[54:53] they read them with three eyes most of
[54:55] them
[54:56] trinitarian ideas
[54:59] hell's eternal soul sleeping
[55:03] you got to remember every major doctrine
[55:05] come from right here
[55:07] good and bad you got to buy the baptism
[55:11] of the holy ghost though
[55:12] reject what's bad
[55:16] and take what's good
[55:19] all right let's uh just for a minute we
[55:21] need we know the first three dimensions
[55:22] of light time and matter we already
[55:23] talked about that and also luke 16
[55:25] we're going to read that in a minute so
[55:27] just keep going
[55:29] and i really want you to see let's go to
[55:32] quote number four we were talking
[55:34] another day about sound barrier
[55:41] this world or this when god looked down
[55:44] through time
[55:45] okay when god looked down through time
[55:47] he saw
[55:49] what what was going to happen right
[55:52] that's the foreknowledge but he knew
[55:55] since the bible told us they would be
[55:58] ages
[56:01] after the acts 19 is everybody with me
[56:04] wake up acts 19
[56:07] or acts or acts and go in the book of
[56:10] acts god knew that he'd have to come
[56:11] back in the holy ghost right
[56:12] holy ghost would have to come that's
[56:14] predestinated that ain't going to change
[56:17] but he had a group there that would take
[56:18] it right all right well now
[56:20] martin luther was not in our church age
[56:22] because he knew that part of martin
[56:24] luther would have
[56:25] was coming out of the catholic church
[56:27] see god looked down through history he
[56:29] saw history
[56:31] listen to him it wasn't history
[56:34] it was happening his dad said sunday is
[56:37] this
[56:37] what god thought of or is this what he's
[56:39] thinking
[56:40] if it's what he thought of he's not
[56:42] eternal
[56:44] because he thought of it back under and
[56:47] it's progressed all the way up no this
[56:49] is what he's thinking right now
[56:50] this is the thoughts of god brother
[56:52] brown said the thoughts of god are
[56:53] eternal
[56:54] so they can't change now the thought of
[56:57] part
[56:58] is going to go away the thought of part
[57:01] the the sinners the the the false
[57:04] doctrine and all those different things
[57:06] but look what happened i want you to
[57:08] understand this is why i keep reading
[57:09] this
[57:10] see what happened to us in the end time
[57:12] god had to come from another dimension
[57:16] and break into this dimension just like
[57:18] that plane i told you
[57:20] there were several other pilots there
[57:22] were several other
[57:24] luther wesley pentecost
[57:27] that came right up to what the plane
[57:30] started shaking
[57:32] we're about 640 miles an hour but i
[57:35] don't think we can take it and they back
[57:36] off
[57:38] we think speaking in tongues is it so
[57:39] we'll just take that we're going to land
[57:40] our plane
[57:41] yeah this is all we got this is it
[57:44] uh we did it but no there was a chuck
[57:47] yeager that was there one day
[57:50] if you read a story same thing happened
[57:53] plain about the fall apart
[57:56] he said i had about that much stick left
[57:58] or throttle left
[58:00] he said all i've done was pushed
[58:03] none of the others pushed brother
[58:04] branham gets in the plane
[58:07] and there's that much throttle left
[58:10] and all he does is push it breaks
[58:13] through the sound barrier
[58:15] and he said it just smoothed right out
[58:17] and man now they run 1500 miles an hour
[58:19] that's
[58:20] almost twice
[58:23] 700 miles an hour it's 1400 miles an
[58:25] hour that is twice
[58:26] past the sound barrier they just went
[58:28] right on past them why that's me and you
[58:31] that's the astronaut age they're running
[58:33] 14 000 miles an hour
[58:35] they're on another planet right now
[58:37] god's gonna have to clean mars off now
[58:39] because we've already touched it
[58:44] right everywhere man's been brother
[58:45] brown said god's gonna have to clean it
[58:48] off
[58:50] but there's two things that happen when
[58:53] you break a sound barrier
[58:56] there's a thunder how many of you heard
[58:58] it
[59:00] i mean you've heard them back when i was
[59:02] a kid they were just breaking because
[59:03] that was in the 50s they were breaking
[59:04] the sound barrier well they would come
[59:06] across and you could hear it
[59:07] and the plane would be 500 feet ahead of
[59:10] the boom
[59:12] but when they broke that sound barrier
[59:13] they were going faster than the speed of
[59:15] sound not light sound which is 700 miles
[59:20] an hour
[59:20] they broke that and it thundered and it
[59:23] made a halo cloud
[59:29] that's what happened in this day
[59:33] when the prophet of god went to arizona
[59:36] where do you think that come from they
[59:38] say oh yeah no some people say that was
[59:39] from a rocket i believe that
[59:42] it was a rocket called seven angel that
[59:44] brother brown says in this quote right
[59:46] here they came from eternity so fast
[59:48] right until they broke the sound barrier
[59:52] and it thundered well what did it do it
[59:54] told him what to do
[59:55] nobody else heard it as in all the
[59:57] different times of of paul being knocked
[59:59] down
[1:00:00] on the road to damascus and jesus
[1:00:02] standing in john 17
[1:00:03] i think it is john 12
[1:00:07] father glorified thy name there came a
[1:00:09] voice from heaven saying i've glorified
[1:00:10] it and glorified again
[1:00:11] people that stood by heard it said it
[1:00:13] thundered
[1:00:15] that's the problem most people in this
[1:00:17] message hear the thunder
[1:00:19] they see the cloud but they don't get
[1:00:23] the voice
[1:00:24] there was a mystery behind all that
[1:00:27] there was an
[1:00:27] opening of the word if we can just break
[1:00:30] through that static of superstition and
[1:00:32] things
[1:00:33] then the holy spirit just begins to fall
[1:00:35] around like anointing and just blesses
[1:00:37] the people
[1:00:37] you know when you receive the baptism in
[1:00:39] the holy ghost we always
[1:00:41] we always use the analogy that if
[1:00:42] somebody fell over dead right now
[1:00:44] you wouldn't have to open the door for
[1:00:45] their soul to get out no it just
[1:00:47] goes into another dimension well when
[1:00:49] you receive the new birth
[1:00:52] it was the soul of god and it came from
[1:00:55] a seventh dimension
[1:00:57] way faster than anything else come right
[1:01:00] through the wall wherever you were down
[1:01:02] on your knees crying
[1:01:03] praying people praying for you and boom
[1:01:06] did the work
[1:01:07] and you know what there was emotion
[1:01:10] there was some things went on
[1:01:12] but they didn't see an interview and
[1:01:14] they didn't see that old you die either
[1:01:17] but it happened it happened you know why
[1:01:21] because you walk now in newness of life
[1:01:25] listen if you don't walk in newness of
[1:01:26] life i'm telling you one more time
[1:01:28] kids to y'all that are 80.
[1:01:32] if you don't have the holy ghost you
[1:01:33] better find out right now whether you
[1:01:35] got it or not
[1:01:38] because it's not it's look but so many
[1:01:41] people today are babied
[1:01:42] petted that's one thing our pastor
[1:01:46] doesn't do and i thank god for that
[1:01:49] i have seen pastors pet people
[1:01:53] and pet them and pet them and they
[1:01:56] stayed babies because you pet
[1:01:58] babies brother dale don't do that he
[1:02:01] says shut up and do your work do your
[1:02:02] job
[1:02:05] do what you're supposed to do thank god
[1:02:06] for that
[1:02:11] but the fourth dimension let's look at
[1:02:13] that just for a second
[1:02:16] we know what happens in the fourth
[1:02:18] dimension we saw
[1:02:20] that before that
[1:02:23] just keep going go to the number
[1:02:26] yeah i just skipped that one i talked
[1:02:27] about that one that's the one where he
[1:02:28] talks about the angels coming from
[1:02:30] eternity
[1:02:31] there you go now we have contact through
[1:02:34] science the fourth dimension
[1:02:36] as it was because coming right through
[1:02:37] this building and i told you that the
[1:02:40] it goes by ohms or loops
[1:02:43] it the lowest one is like three and it's
[1:02:46] like 3 million
[1:02:48] cycles per second it cycles 3 million
[1:02:51] times
[1:02:52] whatever that wave is then there's one
[1:02:54] that's 300 billion times per second
[1:02:56] that they can go down and and man i mean
[1:02:58] how can you talk to somebody in a
[1:03:00] submarine that's two miles down in the
[1:03:02] ocean
[1:03:04] you gotta have something pretty fast and
[1:03:06] i tell you something else is pretty fast
[1:03:09] how long josh did it take for them
[1:03:10] pictures to get from mars to here
[1:03:13] how much 11 minutes and that's traveling
[1:03:17] at the speed of light
[1:03:19] do you know that the sun comes up about
[1:03:21] seven seconds before you see it
[1:03:25] eight minutes eight minutes the sun's
[1:03:29] come up and it takes eight minutes to
[1:03:30] travel that way even at 125 000. that's
[1:03:32] what
[1:03:33] speed of light's 125 000 miles per
[1:03:35] second per second
[1:03:38] so there is travel there is something
[1:03:41] that's got to be done
[1:03:42] that's what i'm telling you the same way
[1:03:43] with this those angels had to travel
[1:03:47] to come into this dimension to talk to
[1:03:49] brother branham then those angels in
[1:03:51] jeffersonville
[1:03:52] remember what brother brown said he said
[1:03:53] you know when the angel met him in the
[1:03:55] cave he said he just walked into that
[1:03:56] light
[1:03:58] where'd he come from he's in a cave by
[1:03:59] itself
[1:04:02] that angel had to slow down out of that
[1:04:04] whatever dimension he was in seventh
[1:04:06] dimension
[1:04:07] he had to slow down to step in that life
[1:04:10] where he could talk to brother branham
[1:04:12] because that was real folks that wasn't
[1:04:13] a spook
[1:04:15] that was real business
[1:04:18] but you and i have to have this sixth
[1:04:20] sense
[1:04:22] to contact what comes through the fourth
[1:04:24] dimension and not this junk
[1:04:26] coming right through this building now
[1:04:28] pictures voice radio pictures on
[1:04:29] television
[1:04:30] that our senses does not contact
[1:04:33] see i believe that you got one two and
[1:04:35] three you got four
[1:04:37] which is has no it's no it's not solid
[1:04:41] one two and three is pretty we're solid
[1:04:43] we're right here we can't go nowhere
[1:04:45] but now in the fourth dimension there's
[1:04:48] no
[1:04:48] there's no limitation same way with like
[1:04:51] it may take a little while for it to get
[1:04:53] to mars that signal
[1:04:54] but that signal comes from here travels
[1:04:57] to mars picks up the
[1:04:58] camera images and brings them back to
[1:05:00] earth
[1:05:01] that's pretty real but with god
[1:05:05] when he brings you a revelation
[1:05:09] you don't have to wait long for it
[1:05:12] you don't have to wait long for how many
[1:05:13] times were you sitting in a church i
[1:05:15] know boyd was in
[1:05:16] in the methodist church and just you
[1:05:18] know had a holy trinity
[1:05:20] taped on his forehead but when he heard
[1:05:23] the truth
[1:05:26] that was eternal that was something that
[1:05:28] came from another dimension it didn't
[1:05:30] come from this one
[1:05:32] your revelation does not come from this
[1:05:34] dimension your revelation comes
[1:05:36] from that seventh dimension comes right
[1:05:37] here to you
[1:05:39] and what you get
[1:05:42] puts you in the fifth to the sixth
[1:05:45] amen because what decision you make here
[1:05:49] because of what comes to you and then
[1:05:52] your travel then
[1:05:54] you either got to go to the fifth
[1:05:55] dimension which we'll talk about in just
[1:05:56] a second
[1:05:57] the fifth dimension which is hell but
[1:05:59] it's not burning
[1:06:01] we saw that before let's let's go on to
[1:06:02] number 10 let's skip some of this and
[1:06:04] we'll
[1:06:04] we'll get done here in just a second
[1:06:12] because remember we know what the fourth
[1:06:14] dimension is we know it's radial waves
[1:06:16] and we know it has no
[1:06:17] plug in it's it's all it's all wi-fi
[1:06:20] it's all the different things that you
[1:06:21] don't have to plug into the wall
[1:06:23] it's running through this building and
[1:06:24] i'm going to tell you something
[1:06:27] when i pray i pray that god doesn't
[1:06:30] influence there's certain people i pray
[1:06:32] for that i know that's being influenced
[1:06:35] by something going through that fourth
[1:06:37] dimension i just know that
[1:06:41] and that's what i pray as lord protect
[1:06:43] them
[1:06:45] because listen without the baptism of
[1:06:47] the holy ghost
[1:06:49] why do you when you were growing up when
[1:06:51] you were in the world
[1:06:53] why did you lean to all that
[1:06:56] because that was your influence that was
[1:06:59] what was bombarding you all the time
[1:07:01] that's why television they bombarded you
[1:07:03] with all those images and
[1:07:05] and subliminal things that they'd put a
[1:07:07] coca-cola real quick in there you know
[1:07:09] a long time ago when dad was growing up
[1:07:11] they had to
[1:07:12] anybody know what a what a drive-through
[1:07:15] restaurant is
[1:07:15] i mean drive-through uh theater is
[1:07:20] not many do you used to drive up to the
[1:07:23] theater
[1:07:24] put this thing in your car and watched
[1:07:27] the screen
[1:07:29] and most of the time it was like
[1:07:32] but anyway but that's what you were
[1:07:35] influenced by and then they would have
[1:07:37] subliminal messages
[1:07:38] that would be so fast and it would be a
[1:07:40] coca-cola or a popcorn
[1:07:42] right donny and you wonder why in the
[1:07:44] world
[1:07:46] why in the world am i hungry at the
[1:07:47] minute and i just eat three pizzas
[1:07:50] being a kid or a young adult i just eat
[1:07:52] three pizzas and drink three coca-colas
[1:07:55] and now i'm sitting here watching this
[1:07:56] movie in five minutes into the movie i
[1:07:58] need some popcorn
[1:08:00] wow that subliminal message was on that
[1:08:02] screen that you didn't see it it was so
[1:08:04] fast
[1:08:05] you couldn't see it with your natural
[1:08:06] eye but what picked it up
[1:08:08] your subconscious picked it up the
[1:08:11] spiritual part of you picked it up
[1:08:14] and it made this thing react to it
[1:08:18] remember they did away with that because
[1:08:19] they made it illegal because it was
[1:08:21] making people do all kinds of stuff
[1:08:23] and you never see it but once you slow
[1:08:25] it down
[1:08:26] you could see that image of that
[1:08:27] coca-cola or that popcorn with butter
[1:08:31] all over the pump card anyway
[1:08:34] so but see that's what listen you and
[1:08:36] our influence
[1:08:38] by that fourth dimension even brother
[1:08:40] brown said demons traveled in the fourth
[1:08:42] dimension
[1:08:43] cancers all that travel and where is it
[1:08:46] going
[1:08:47] it's going in here it's going in here
[1:08:50] not so much in your mouth but it's
[1:08:53] influencing you
[1:08:54] and you don't even know it right that's
[1:08:57] why with a carnal mind you can't contact
[1:08:59] god
[1:09:01] because you've got all that other stuff
[1:09:03] to contact but once you get the mind of
[1:09:05] christ what is it
[1:09:06] the base has found a receptor
[1:09:09] or somewhere it can send it to and then
[1:09:12] he can talk to you
[1:09:14] because listen that's one thing for sure
[1:09:16] the devil does not want you to have a
[1:09:18] revelation of god
[1:09:21] he does not he fights it he'll send you
[1:09:23] everything in the world but that
[1:09:27] so that fourth dimension absolutely
[1:09:30] still influences us
[1:09:33] even when we're talking on cell phone
[1:09:34] when we're doing all the different
[1:09:35] things
[1:09:36] wi-fi and all that it's beating your
[1:09:38] head you just don't know that it's
[1:09:40] beating your brain
[1:09:41] going through your conscious
[1:09:43] subconscious all the time
[1:09:45] all the time it's influencing you look
[1:09:47] now man it's it's just everywhere
[1:09:49] there's nothing plugged in anymore
[1:09:50] everything has to go through the
[1:09:51] airwaves
[1:09:53] amen
[1:09:56] now the fifth dimension is where the
[1:09:57] center of the unbeliever dies and goes
[1:09:59] to the fifth dimension is kind of well
[1:10:00] the horrible dimension
[1:10:03] now this man when the christian dies he
[1:10:04] goes in the sixth dimension
[1:10:06] and god is in the seventh dimension now
[1:10:08] then we see the christian when he dies
[1:10:10] he goes under the altar of god right
[1:10:11] into the presence of god under the altar
[1:10:14] and he's at rest
[1:10:16] to break it down when a man has a
[1:10:17] nightmare he's not altogether asleep
[1:10:20] neither is he awake he's between sleep
[1:10:23] and awake
[1:10:24] and that's what makes him have a
[1:10:25] horrible shaking and screaming because
[1:10:27] he's not asleep
[1:10:28] and he's not awake and to take that
[1:10:31] shows where a man goes when he dies
[1:10:33] unconverted he's lived his time up
[1:10:37] he's dead on earth and he cannot go into
[1:10:39] the presence of god
[1:10:41] because he's not fit to go there without
[1:10:43] the blood
[1:10:46] and he's caught he can't come back to
[1:10:48] earth
[1:10:49] because his time's finished here and
[1:10:52] he's caught between and he's in a
[1:10:54] nightmare
[1:10:55] he can't go in the presence of god to
[1:10:56] rest and he can't back come back to
[1:10:58] earth because his time's up
[1:11:00] he's in a nightmare and there he stays
[1:11:03] think about somebody like
[1:11:05] like cain or somebody that died i say
[1:11:09] un unregenerated he's been falling for
[1:11:12] years
[1:11:13] thousands of years so let's read this
[1:11:16] next one
[1:11:17] countdown then i think the fifth
[1:11:20] dimension is where the center dies where
[1:11:22] he goes
[1:11:23] now think that when the sinner dies he
[1:11:25] goes to this nate says fourth dimension
[1:11:27] he means fifth
[1:11:28] the first thing he cannot go in the
[1:11:29] presence of god because he's a sinner
[1:11:30] and his time's up on earth
[1:11:32] if i would type it for you it's like
[1:11:33] going to sleep how many of you been
[1:11:35] asleep
[1:11:37] the most vivid dream i ever had in my
[1:11:39] life was i got shot in the head with a
[1:11:41] gun
[1:11:43] my head hurt when i woke up just like
[1:11:45] somebody shot me in the head but that's
[1:11:47] how i woke me up
[1:11:48] somebody was robbing a convenience store
[1:11:52] and i was the i was trying to get him
[1:11:55] out
[1:11:55] out the door of the convenience store to
[1:11:57] you know keep the other people and i
[1:11:58] said take me outside but when he took me
[1:12:00] outside and saw the police
[1:12:01] he just he pulled the trigger when he
[1:12:03] did i felt the thing hit me in the head
[1:12:05] and woke me up
[1:12:06] but you know what i woke up though
[1:12:09] that's been years ago and i think i'm
[1:12:12] all right now
[1:12:14] but what about if you can't what if
[1:12:16] that's a recurring dream that you can't
[1:12:18] wake up from
[1:12:19] right what if that's something in your
[1:12:21] life that that maybe god
[1:12:23] came to you during a time of that and
[1:12:26] says here let me help you and you said
[1:12:27] no i don't want any help
[1:12:29] well whatever that was is just a
[1:12:30] recurring nightmare
[1:12:32] because remember look the
[1:12:36] presence of god is hell enough for me
[1:12:38] not having the presence of god not being
[1:12:41] able
[1:12:41] to be have grace not being able to know
[1:12:44] that there's a god that can save me
[1:12:46] and you being in a place where you came
[1:12:48] that's more hell than anything you
[1:12:50] burning up would be a pleasure but that
[1:12:53] recurring nightmare look hideous things
[1:12:55] are screaming
[1:12:56] that's the state of the wicked dead he
[1:12:58] can't go in the presence of god because
[1:12:59] he's a sinner
[1:13:00] he cannot return back to earth because
[1:13:02] his time's up and he's caught between
[1:13:03] the two things in the fifth dimension
[1:13:05] he's got a soul and he cannot go in the
[1:13:07] presence of god
[1:13:08] because it's not covered by the blood
[1:13:10] he's a sinner he cannot wake himself up
[1:13:12] because his time's up on earth
[1:13:14] so there he is in a tormented nightmare
[1:13:17] think of that now before you enter it
[1:13:19] a nightmare scream many of us have had
[1:13:21] nightmares it's just because you're
[1:13:23] told because the two consciences are
[1:13:24] passing sub
[1:13:26] and first conscious and it catches
[1:13:27] between how many of you had a weird
[1:13:30] dream
[1:13:30] but it's and you don't even know where
[1:13:32] in the world that come from
[1:13:34] well that's the two dimensions something
[1:13:36] something influenced that you just don't
[1:13:37] know exactly what it was
[1:13:39] and that's the nightmare when a sinner
[1:13:40] dies he's caught with his soul
[1:13:42] between earth and hell in a nightmare
[1:13:45] and there he stands
[1:13:48] all right let's go to the next one
[1:13:53] let's read that one for christ also once
[1:13:56] suffered for sin for just to the unjust
[1:13:58] now we know what happened there
[1:14:00] he went when he when he gave his life at
[1:14:02] calvary
[1:14:04] his soul didn't stay in the tomb his
[1:14:06] soul went down to hell
[1:14:08] and preached unto the soul upon to the
[1:14:11] spirits
[1:14:12] in prison now remember i have another
[1:14:15] quote but i'm not going to read it
[1:14:17] where brother brown said see they were
[1:14:19] people they were souls they could talk
[1:14:21] to him
[1:14:22] just like when he goes to paradise and
[1:14:24] he opens up the door and abraham says
[1:14:26] hey sarah that's the man we fed the calf
[1:14:27] to
[1:14:28] ezekiel was looking over his shoulder
[1:14:30] and said that's the wheel in the middle
[1:14:31] of the wheel
[1:14:33] all the different ones saw him in their
[1:14:35] own revelation
[1:14:36] but it was a man standing there it was
[1:14:39] god in theophany form was standing there
[1:14:41] amen
[1:14:42] by which you went and preached into the
[1:14:44] spirits of prison which sometimes were
[1:14:45] disobedient
[1:14:46] but once the long-suffering of god
[1:14:48] waited in the days of noah
[1:14:50] thank god for a prophet brother brown
[1:14:52] said that was all those people that died
[1:14:53] in the flood
[1:14:54] that turned god down because see
[1:14:56] everybody turned god down by eight
[1:14:57] people
[1:14:59] while the ark was preparing within
[1:15:01] wherein few that is eight souls
[1:15:04] were saved by water all right keep going
[1:15:07] number 12 souls in prison now jesus
[1:15:09] after he'd finished his ministry
[1:15:10] preached to those souls
[1:15:12] that were unsavable now god by foreign
[1:15:15] knowledge knew they were unsavable so he
[1:15:16] fixed the place for him
[1:15:18] but remember we're going to read here in
[1:15:20] just a second and then we'll close
[1:15:22] it's not a burning hell there is no
[1:15:24] judgment has been passed yet
[1:15:26] on anybody except the devil
[1:15:30] and the beast because the bible's
[1:15:32] already said that all right
[1:15:34] now watch he went and preached to the
[1:15:36] souls that were in prison that repented
[1:15:37] not
[1:15:38] when mercy was given to them look that's
[1:15:40] what i mean that moment that they were
[1:15:42] given mercy they spurned it so whatever
[1:15:45] state they were in that's the state that
[1:15:48] they're sitting there in the loop i
[1:15:49] believe in the fifth dimension
[1:15:51] knowing and realizing that somebody did
[1:15:54] something
[1:15:55] for them and they rejected it when mercy
[1:15:58] was given to them they spurned mercy and
[1:16:00] now they're waiting for the judgment oh
[1:16:01] what a time
[1:16:02] that must have been oh i wish there's
[1:16:04] some way i could shake the world with
[1:16:06] that to let them see the reality see
[1:16:08] what the reality is all right let's go
[1:16:10] to 13.
[1:16:13] but after the days of his preaching his
[1:16:14] ministry continued on
[1:16:16] because the last group he preached to
[1:16:17] was the souls that were in hell
[1:16:19] that could not be forgiven i have
[1:16:21] clearly read that from the bible here in
[1:16:22] ii peter
[1:16:23] he went and preached to the souls that
[1:16:25] were in prison which is hell
[1:16:27] locked up until the day of judgment so
[1:16:30] they can't move
[1:16:32] because you see the judgment isn't now
[1:16:35] there is no burning hell now see thank
[1:16:38] god for that because you know what
[1:16:39] everybody said well now we're in hell
[1:16:40] burning no there's not a burning hell
[1:16:42] right now
[1:16:45] somebody tells you the guy's in the
[1:16:47] burning hell that's wrong
[1:16:49] a judge of this earth is just enough to
[1:16:51] never condemn a man until he's brought
[1:16:53] to trial
[1:16:54] so when we get to the white throne
[1:16:56] judgment that's the trial
[1:16:59] and god will never throw a man into the
[1:17:01] fiery furnace until first he is
[1:17:03] condemned
[1:17:04] by god's own laws he rejected mercy so
[1:17:08] you see he first
[1:17:09] has to have a trial and the trial is the
[1:17:12] great white throne judgment
[1:17:14] but now he's in a place called a prison
[1:17:17] house
[1:17:19] all right let's read this in luke and
[1:17:21] then we'll finish right here
[1:17:24] and there was a certain beggar named
[1:17:25] lazarus which was laid at his gate full
[1:17:28] of sores
[1:17:29] and desired to be fed with the crumbs
[1:17:31] which fell from the rich man's table
[1:17:33] moreover the dogs came and licked his
[1:17:34] sores and it came to pass that the
[1:17:37] beggar died and it was he was carried
[1:17:39] by the angels into abraham's bosom now
[1:17:42] remember we know that's paradise
[1:17:44] that's not the sixth dimension but there
[1:17:46] was a place there for those old
[1:17:48] testament saints called paradise
[1:17:50] it wasn't that abraham was sitting there
[1:17:51] and everybody was sitting in his chest
[1:17:53] his bosom it was the faith abraham was
[1:17:56] the father of faith
[1:17:58] they died with a what with a
[1:18:01] they had a testimony that they believed
[1:18:04] what abraham believed
[1:18:07] and desired to be filled with the crumbs
[1:18:08] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:18:10] and was carried
[1:18:11] by the angels into abraham's bosom the
[1:18:13] rich man also died and was buried
[1:18:15] and in hell he lifted up his eyes being
[1:18:17] in torments now remember
[1:18:19] there's no burning hell but he's being
[1:18:21] tormented
[1:18:22] right and in hell he lifted up his eyes
[1:18:25] who
[1:18:26] the rich young ruler being in torments
[1:18:28] and seeth abraham
[1:18:30] afar off because look from that
[1:18:33] paradise to where that rich young world
[1:18:36] was
[1:18:36] must have not been a complete wall that
[1:18:40] must have been
[1:18:40] be able to see through the dimensions
[1:18:42] they were so close
[1:18:44] because remember look let me be honest
[1:18:47] paradise was a holding place
[1:18:52] until calvary they couldn't go in the
[1:18:54] presence of god under bulls and goats
[1:18:56] that's why i said they they they did
[1:18:58] there was no new birth in the old
[1:19:00] testament so there can't be a sixth
[1:19:01] dimension
[1:19:02] that you can put there like brother
[1:19:04] branham because remember when samuel was
[1:19:06] brought up
[1:19:06] samuel was not a young man samuel was
[1:19:10] the same prophet that brother brown said
[1:19:12] he had his prophet robe and everything
[1:19:13] still on
[1:19:14] and they recognized who he was now
[1:19:16] listen when brother brown went across
[1:19:17] the curtain of time
[1:19:18] he couldn't recognize a bunch of them
[1:19:20] people except the ones he saw when he
[1:19:21] was younger
[1:19:22] the 90-year-old woman that got eternal
[1:19:24] life
[1:19:25] he didn't know who she was he started
[1:19:27] when she was 90 years old
[1:19:29] so that place of to me paradise was just
[1:19:31] a holding place
[1:19:33] waiting christ to die on the cross
[1:19:36] then he could empty up that and put him
[1:19:38] in a dimension
[1:19:40] but lazarus and he left hell
[1:19:44] in hell the rich young ruler lifted up
[1:19:46] his eyes being in torments
[1:19:47] and see if abraham are far off at
[1:19:48] lazarus in his bosom in other words they
[1:19:50] were standing together
[1:19:52] all right and he cried and said father
[1:19:54] abraham have mercy on me
[1:19:57] and send lazarus that he may dip the tip
[1:19:59] of his finger in water
[1:20:00] and cool my tongue for i am tormented by
[1:20:03] this flame
[1:20:04] now i look that word flame up it does
[1:20:06] not mean fire
[1:20:09] it means a torment not a literal flame
[1:20:12] because the prophet just told us there
[1:20:14] is no burning hell
[1:20:15] at the moment all right but look that
[1:20:17] word up it doesn't always mean
[1:20:20] fire it's a torment
[1:20:23] but abraham said son remember that thou
[1:20:26] in thy lifetime
[1:20:27] see you don't lose your senses when you
[1:20:29] go in these dimensions
[1:20:32] because abraham is telling that man boy
[1:20:35] remember what happened
[1:20:38] abraham said son remember that thou in
[1:20:41] thy lifetime receiveth
[1:20:43] thy good things and likewise lazarus
[1:20:45] evil things
[1:20:46] but now he has comforted and thou art
[1:20:49] tormented
[1:20:51] you know i preached that sermon one time
[1:20:52] why was the heathen rage i should have
[1:20:53] read that scripture
[1:20:55] let them rage all they want to look what
[1:20:58] the rich young ruler got
[1:21:00] and look what lazarus god
[1:21:04] and beside all this between us and you
[1:21:06] there's a great gulf fish in other words
[1:21:07] there's a dimension you can't we can't
[1:21:09] pass so that they which would pass from
[1:21:12] hence to you cannot
[1:21:14] neither can they pass to us that would
[1:21:16] come from there
[1:21:17] or from thence look then he said i pray
[1:21:19] thee therefore father
[1:21:21] that thou would ascend him to my
[1:21:23] father's house
[1:21:25] for i have five brethren that he may
[1:21:27] testify unto them who the
[1:21:30] lazarus lest they also come into this
[1:21:32] place of torment
[1:21:34] abraham said unto him they have moses
[1:21:37] and the prophets
[1:21:38] let them hear them in other words
[1:21:40] they're still alive
[1:21:41] they have a choice they got to hear what
[1:21:43] the prophet said
[1:21:45] but the rich young willer didn't have a
[1:21:47] choice he doesn't made his choice
[1:21:49] and abraham said nay father and he said
[1:21:52] nay father abraham
[1:21:54] but if one went unto them from the dead
[1:21:57] they will repent now watch
[1:21:59] what abraham say if they hear not moses
[1:22:01] and the prophets
[1:22:02] neither will they be persuaded though
[1:22:04] one rose from the dead
[1:22:08] because why they made their choice
[1:22:09] they're where they're they're where
[1:22:10] they're at and that's where they're
[1:22:11] gonna have to stay
[1:22:13] is that all right that's where they're
[1:22:14] gonna have to stay
[1:22:17] and we'll get to i wanna read this
[1:22:21] one more part they don't have this
[1:22:22] revelation six verse nine
[1:22:24] i've been studying a little bit on the
[1:22:25] sixth seal fifth seal and when he had
[1:22:27] opened the fifth seal i saw on the altar
[1:22:29] the souls of them that were slain for
[1:22:30] the word of god
[1:22:31] now remember we're over in here now
[1:22:35] the fifth seal opens over here the fifth
[1:22:37] seal didn't open in the
[1:22:38] in the old testament so there's a place
[1:22:41] of holding for that fifth sealed jew
[1:22:43] that's not in the sixth and can't be in
[1:22:45] the fifth it's gotta be somewhere in
[1:22:47] there though
[1:22:48] but it's a holding place because watch
[1:22:50] when it opened the fifth seal i saw
[1:22:52] under the altar
[1:22:54] now remember they can't be under the
[1:22:55] altar of god
[1:22:57] because watch what happens and they cry
[1:23:00] with a loud voice saying how long
[1:23:02] lord holy and true dost thou not judge
[1:23:06] and avenge our blood that's where
[1:23:09] brother brown got through revelation
[1:23:10] that that wasn't christians
[1:23:12] because christians would not call for
[1:23:13] blood he said that's the fifth sealed
[1:23:15] jew that's going to be given eternal
[1:23:17] life
[1:23:18] avenge our blood on them that dwell on
[1:23:20] the earth revelation 6 11 says in white
[1:23:22] robes
[1:23:23] were given unto every one of them and it
[1:23:25] was said unto them that they should what
[1:23:27] rest yet for a little season until their
[1:23:30] fellow servants also and their brethren
[1:23:32] that should be killed
[1:23:33] as they were we know that's 144 000
[1:23:36] should be fulfilled so there's a place
[1:23:39] of holding for them too
[1:23:41] you know why because god saw listen to
[1:23:43] this come on musician
[1:23:44] god saw he had to blind the jews
[1:23:49] god saw he had to blind the jews to get
[1:23:52] me and you
[1:23:53] because the jews were his first love the
[1:23:56] jews were his first
[1:23:57] wife the jews were the david apple of
[1:24:01] his
[1:24:02] eye but he knew they would do what they
[1:24:05] were going to do
[1:24:06] but he couldn't make them listen come on
[1:24:08] ellie
[1:24:09] they let's stand our feet ellie's going
[1:24:11] to come up here and
[1:24:13] sing a song or something
[1:24:18] she's too fast for you brother danny
[1:24:22] she was coming up here to get joyce
[1:24:26] but you see those people there's a place
[1:24:28] of holding because god gave them eternal
[1:24:29] life
[1:24:30] because if he hadn't blinded their eyes
[1:24:32] you and i wouldn't have come in
[1:24:34] he would have took the jews they would
[1:24:35] have been his wife there would have been
[1:24:36] nothing else left and he'd have been
[1:24:38] just like the old testament he said
[1:24:39] destroy every one of them
[1:24:40] because you're my people and then i'm
[1:24:42] going to put you in the promised land
[1:24:45] right that's what he would have done but
[1:24:48] he knew what they would do he knew they
[1:24:49] would fall he knew they would go hard
[1:24:51] but he knew there would be a rahab he
[1:24:54] knew there would be a woman at the well
[1:24:57] he knew there'd be somebody that'd say
[1:24:59] be it unto me
[1:25:00] according to my word i'll take the
[1:25:02] scraps off of the floor
[1:25:05] bring me the scraps that the dogs eat
[1:25:07] i'll eat them
[1:25:08] call me a dog if you want to lord that's
[1:25:10] fine i know
[1:25:12] who i am but i know who you are
[1:25:15] and you're the master and you owned the
[1:25:17] table
[1:25:18] you owned the food and you owned me so
[1:25:21] she couldn't lose let's sing a song god
[1:25:23] bless your heart
[1:25:27] he that is in me
[1:25:30] greater is he that is in me
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:35] is he that is in me
[1:25:39] than he that is in the world
[1:25:43] oh satan's like a roaring lion
[1:25:48] running to and fro let's think about
[1:25:51] these that are not here tonight the ones
[1:25:54] that are sick and can't get to church
[1:25:57] we know their desire is to be here
[1:26:00] we pray that the lord will give them a
[1:26:01] blessing tonight
[1:26:04] to walk in some wheat hour
[1:26:07] [Music]
[1:26:10] mustache today is overcoming powell
[1:26:17] oh greater is he that is in me
[1:26:22] and greater is he that is in me
[1:26:26] greater is he that is in me
[1:26:30] than he that is in the world listen now
[1:26:34] oh on the day of pentecost
[1:26:39] a rushing mighty wind
[1:26:43] he fell into the upper room
[1:26:47] and baptized all of them listen now
[1:26:52] with the power greater than
[1:26:56] any earthly foe
[1:27:00] oh i'm so glad i got into
[1:27:04] and i'm gonna let the whole world know
[1:27:07] sing it to him
[1:27:08] oh greater is he that is in me
[1:27:13] greater is he that is in me
[1:27:18] for greater is he that is in me
[1:27:21] than he that is in the world
[1:27:25] he loved the lord
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:30] god knew what we'd need saw what we'd
[1:27:33] need
[1:27:34] and give it to us and put it in plain
[1:27:38] common language so we can understand it
[1:27:42] but he had to send us a prophet to make
[1:27:44] it more clear
[1:27:46] and we thank god for that but we thank
[1:27:48] god more for the holy ghost because
[1:27:50] without the holy ghost you'll not
[1:27:51] understand what the prophet says
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:54] amen you love the lord and i'm gonna let
[1:27:57] the whole world know knows you're
[1:27:59] dismissed
[1:28:00] oh greater is he that is in me
[1:28:05] greater is he that is in me
[1:28:09] greater is he that is in me
[1:28:13] than he that is
