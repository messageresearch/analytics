[0:14] this everyone I wonder
[0:27] [Music]
[0:32] [Music]

[20:25] house of the Lord got your Bibles let's
[20:27] turn to 2nd Corinthians 5 we're going to
[20:30] continue kind of our thought from last
[20:32] one day we answered those questions I
[20:36] think maybe one of them was weird
[20:39] we need to maybe address a little more
[20:41] today but I want to talk just a little
[20:45] while on one subject that that may help
[20:48] us it's like brother Dale said if Peter
[20:50] kept reading his quotes you're going to
[20:52] hear them again if we get to them so
[20:54] Allah who is this Melchizedek and
[20:57] different things so we are we're going
[21:01] to speak today we're going to stay on
[21:02] the fall but we're going to look at the
[21:04] full effect and then for a subtitle to
[21:06] life's not to lives Li ves to life's all
[21:11] right property guard talks about to
[21:13] life's LIF is not wise
[21:17] life's to life's so let's bow our head
[21:22] before we get started
[21:23] family Father we pray Lord that you'll
[21:26] be with us again today Lord you be the
[21:29] active participant in this service you
[21:30] be the speaker you'd be the hear you're
[21:33] the only one that can reveal Lord we
[21:35] pray that we will let this sink down
[21:37] deep in our heart become part of us
[21:40] it'll help us on our journey Lord as we
[21:42] continue to strive and try to serve you
[21:45] father we pray for the ones that are
[21:47] sick and not with us the ones that are
[21:50] traveling ones that are doing other
[21:52] things Lord the missionaries on the
[21:53] foreign fields bless them Lord give them
[21:55] fruit for their labor and be with them
[21:57] too Lord in the next month we know that
[21:59] they're coming in for the camp meeting
[22:01] in August and from all over the world
[22:03] just be with them Lord and keep them
[22:04] safe other forgive us of our sins and
[22:07] our many mistakes Lord heal the ones
[22:10] that need healing father but most of all
[22:11] the ones that are since 8 we pray that
[22:13] you touch their soul bring them into
[22:17] this body Lord this wonderful body that
[22:20] there's no other family like this family
[22:22] Lord there's no other family like the
[22:25] family of the Lord Jesus Christ father
[22:27] just be with us further of this service
[22:29] in Jesus name we pray amen
[22:32] second corinthians 5 verse 1 for we know
[22:34] that if our earthly House of this
[22:36] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[22:38] building of God and house not made with
[22:40] hands eternal in the heavens
[22:42] all right you noticed that doesn't say
[22:44] heaven
[22:46] that says heavens all right we may get
[22:50] into that but we may not because I got
[22:51] another little path I want to go down
[22:53] but we need to read this for in this
[22:55] week groan earnestly desiring to be
[22:57] clothed upon with our house which is
[22:59] from heaven got it one says heavens that
[23:06] says heaven all right if so be that
[23:11] being clothed we shall not be found
[23:13] naked I was thinking about what daddy
[23:14] said today you know the thinker you know
[23:18] he's like he's naked and he's like this
[23:19] and they put him everywhere
[23:20] he's wondering where he's clothed here
[23:25] everybody that put him you know made him
[23:28] they've all made him naked he's out in
[23:29] the middle of a park somewhere doing
[23:31] this well he's wondering where the
[23:32] clothes are the somebody's go to put on
[23:34] him but anyway that was just something I
[23:36] was thinking this morning for a we that
[23:39] are in this time were not grown being
[23:42] burdened not for that we would be
[23:45] unclothed but clothed upon that
[23:47] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[23:52] all right now let's go to Galatians 2
[23:54] verse 20 because I want you to see this
[23:56] I didn't see it in this way so last
[23:59] night I was reading I was thinking about
[24:01] the - light - lights Allah is not lives
[24:05] and watch what Paul said I am crucified
[24:07] with Christ nevertheless I live so
[24:10] nevertheless he's got he's a living
[24:11] human being all right yet not i but
[24:14] Christ liveth in me and the life which I
[24:18] now live which means he lived another
[24:21] life previously but this that's where
[24:24] you get you to life's from and the life
[24:26] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[24:31] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[24:34] and gave himself for me you may be
[24:37] seated in the Lord add his blessing to
[24:39] the reading of the word let me get all
[24:41] this put back together here where you
[24:43] going you leave it okay no I go I guess
[24:48] no I think I guess I'm self-sufficient
[24:50] man I can do this
[24:56] why I'm self-sufficient you think I look
[24:59] like I'm starved
[25:01] don't I know how to cook I got in there
[25:06] last night in June was making she was
[25:10] making breakfast and I said I want some
[25:11] potatoes and fried potatoes and onions
[25:16] high fried potatoes and onions yeah
[25:19] that's what I thought
[25:22] no I you know what I need I might hold
[25:25] this back numbers could y'all forgive me
[25:33] can everybody see that he might see me
[25:37] no good I may have to have a piece of
[25:41] tape hey Bob wait Bob can you bring me
[25:45] some tape that back part is broke and I
[25:48] taped it up so I think he may left the
[25:51] building too so anyway let's get back to
[25:54] what we were talking about last Sunday
[25:58] all right so bye all right with that
[26:01] what I'm going to do is is we're going
[26:03] to like brother Dale talking about we're
[26:05] going we're talking about Redemption so
[26:06] we got to come to a place I gotta have a
[26:10] tape yeah cause every time I push on
[26:13] this thing the back starts falling you
[26:16] are worth something that is wonderful
[26:19] thank you good job Donnie did leave
[26:24] Danny he left the building
[26:29] buy some duct tape it'd be a lot better
[26:32] but this is all right that's 200 mile an
[26:37] hour duct tape works fine now all right
[26:40] we got it we good there you are darling
[26:44] all right so what we were talking about
[26:46] last Sunday is this man
[26:54] that we call it he it was started with
[26:56] the logos remember all right we come
[26:59] down and brought in that word theophany
[27:04] everybody all right say man all right so
[27:06] we brought that it was a man that was
[27:08] speaking and it was white it was the
[27:12] Word of God listen God cannot say
[27:15] anything outside of his word he doesn't
[27:19] speak idol there's no Idol words and God
[27:22] everything he speaks when he speaks
[27:24] something happened all right he doesn't
[27:26] just carry on a conversation for the
[27:28] sake of conversation know what he
[27:31] believes what he says all right he
[27:34] believes his own work all right so this
[27:37] life that he is which he is he is and
[27:40] I'm going to read it in a little while
[27:42] but brother Branham called him King
[27:46] theophany amen
[27:49] that makes him King I mean that makes
[27:52] him the only theophany the only
[27:57] theophany there really is is God himself
[28:00] and then and out of him comes the word
[28:05] or what was inside of him like me and
[28:08] you like I want you to understand that
[28:09] because me and you we have conversation
[28:13] and and you know brother Hal and and
[28:17] Tony gotta wear got we all got talking
[28:20] about Bigfoot well now we know one thing
[28:24] for sure there's not a Bigfoot there's
[28:28] some people with big feet there's not we
[28:30] could take anderson and run him through
[28:31] the woods back there and they would have
[28:33] thought it was sasquatch but you see
[28:36] that's an idle word though that's that's
[28:38] nothing God doesn't do that God doesn't
[28:41] just sit back and go I think no when he
[28:45] he has a purpose for everything that he
[28:47] does everything every move God makes
[28:50] that's why the Bible is the brother
[28:52] branham said is the perfect Word of God
[28:54] man there was no addition there's we're
[28:57] not going to get to heaven or we're not
[28:59] going to get to this great position and
[29:01] go
[29:02] we need another Bible or we need another
[29:04] word we don't need another word what
[29:07] from the beginning coming out of this
[29:10] great fountain of this theophany man is
[29:13] exactly what me and you need man alright
[29:16] now we come to this person which is only
[29:22] one person a man but many titles and
[29:27] we'll read some of them in the Bible he
[29:29] when we get down here a little bit
[29:30] further but we know what happened in the
[29:33] fall so what happened in the fall when
[29:35] God spoke the word the word came forth
[29:38] in Genesis 1:26 to multiply and
[29:41] replenish the earth subdue the earth do
[29:43] all these great things God blessed them
[29:45] well that was what that was a man
[29:49] speaking what his children into
[29:51] existence that was Poppa God and man you
[29:55] got to understand one thing Adam was the
[29:58] ruler of the earth he was a son of God
[30:00] but he was not the God and then he's not
[30:04] King theophany he's part of King
[30:08] theophany you and I are part of King
[30:11] theophany but you and I are not the
[30:14] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[30:16] man all right we remember last Sunday
[30:19] he's the big G and if you'll read your
[30:21] Bible it when it says ye are gods it's a
[30:24] little G it's not big G so if we keep
[30:27] that in order he's the big G he's the
[30:29] creator he's the one that speaks and it
[30:32] happened but now being that we have this
[30:35] in our genealogy when you come down to
[30:39] here we're just like our daddy just not
[30:44] the fullness so we're not King theophany
[30:47] but we are part of King theophany and we
[30:50] anything that comes from God is eternal
[30:53] that is a part of God right all right so
[30:57] that's the eternal life okay so that's
[31:04] one life eternal I love that word and
[31:08] Lewis stole stole my quote this morning
[31:12] thanks a lot Lily we were talking about
[31:14] grace I said Knox not grace it's amazing
[31:16] grace you see what he said that Dave
[31:18] use them a quotes man will charge you
[31:23] for that one but look we have God in
[31:26] this is all eternal life Satan does not
[31:30] have eternal life Satan is not a creator
[31:33] Satan is a pervert err he perverts
[31:36] everything he touches amen because what
[31:40] glock told us to multiply and replenish
[31:42] the earth in this theophany form that he
[31:45] created were formed before the
[31:48] foundation of the world Genesis 1:26 man
[31:50] before we were put in flesh he told us
[31:52] to multiply and replenish the earth well
[31:54] Satan was not telling a lie to Eve
[31:57] saying you need to multiply and
[31:59] replenish the earth he just told her a
[32:02] different way of doing it than what King
[32:04] theophany wanted us to do alright King
[32:08] theophany is always true always right
[32:11] always eternal life amen
[32:13] because we're going to see that there
[32:15] was another life that came in li Fei
[32:18] once you know once a life lives its life
[32:22] but God is the only eternal life which
[32:26] never had a beginning never have an
[32:29] ending like brother nel teddy just as
[32:31] much that way is this way we try to come
[32:34] this way a lot more than we go that way
[32:36] but God is always ever-present he's the
[32:39] I am he's the creator no one else can
[32:43] create amen
[32:45] all right now sure God called us that's
[32:49] why I let me tell you something about
[32:50] this message and about the Bible you can
[32:54] make statements like what I just made
[32:57] that God is the creator and we're not
[33:00] but then it but then we're called a
[33:02] little critter see what I'm saying is
[33:04] that on that onion peel you got to peel
[33:07] that layer back you got to run it
[33:08] through the filter of your Holy Ghost
[33:10] and know what I'm talking about
[33:13] amen and everything because you can take
[33:16] what brother Brown says and you can find
[33:18] a quote totally opposite let's stand up
[33:21] in the dress the third person of the
[33:23] Trinity he talks about in one quote that
[33:25] I gave you last night he talks about the
[33:26] Trinity well there's no such thing as a
[33:29] Trinity
[33:30] a property God never believes in a
[33:32] Trinity right
[33:33] but he said Trinity run it through your
[33:38] filter you know there's not a Trinity if
[33:41] you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:43] that's why that I see now more than ever
[33:45] if we don't have the Holy Ghost we will
[33:48] absolutely take it in our own Flint
[33:51] right we will we will slant it what what
[33:55] they do Satan can't get the Holy Ghost
[33:57] bless his heart
[33:58] well that's why he slapped everything he
[34:01] can't stand the pure Word of God he
[34:03] can't stay on the true word he has to
[34:06] slant it what and his angle amen God is
[34:12] pure and true and he is eternal and
[34:14] that's what we must depend on I have to
[34:17] hook myself to eternity amen because
[34:20] it's constant and then it doesn't do
[34:23] this but now Satan what did he do he
[34:26] broke that thing off right brought us
[34:29] down into time where we're now in time
[34:34] brother Brown said time began after the
[34:37] fall okay and I'm like brother Tim Humes
[34:42] and he made a good point of the day he
[34:45] said why do we have to bring 30 or 40
[34:47] quotes with us when we come to preach we
[34:50] should be to the point now to where we
[34:53] can at least if you have never read the
[34:55] quote verbatim you should run it through
[34:58] your filter and that filter could should
[35:02] say that ain't nothing but the truth
[35:04] that ain't nothing but the truth that's
[35:06] exactly what he said amen
[35:10] not-not-not
[35:11] you know bro they'll read quotes I got
[35:13] 15 of them right here but what does it
[35:17] do though for the younger ones are for
[35:18] some that are not that are still in
[35:22] kindergarten of course you got one to
[35:24] the born-again when they're born again
[35:25] you're a babe and you got it you got to
[35:27] grow up so you have to preach all of
[35:28] them but we don't have to we don't have
[35:31] to proper it's not theory anymore God's
[35:34] Word is never a theory it's a fact all
[35:39] right Satan brains theories but we have
[35:42] to go by the facts
[35:44] the Word of God and I have to and I
[35:46] you'll see me using this where I have to
[35:47] hook myself back to that eternal life
[35:49] amen because without eternal life the
[35:52] life that I have before Paul said the
[35:56] life which I now live I live by the
[35:59] faith of the Son of God but the one I
[36:00] lived before I lived I'll read it in a
[36:03] minute remember you lived in the world
[36:07] you lived in the world the world is what
[36:10] influenced you that life is what
[36:12] influenced you from the day you were
[36:14] born he said it doesn't matter if you
[36:17] never told a lie in your life you'd born
[36:19] a lot that's right you say well I didn't
[36:24] lie didn't steal see we put what we do
[36:26] is we make a list well I didn't do that
[36:31] I didn't do that I didn't do that I
[36:32] didn't do that addenda left any one of
[36:38] them
[36:39] so let's don't list you know like Bob
[36:44] was talking like somebody was saying
[36:45] about statue of a perfect man they was
[36:47] talking about somebody could still cut
[36:49] their hair and this is someone another
[36:51] church they're teaching was it even at
[36:53] faith that you can still a woman can
[36:55] still cut her hair and you know a man
[36:57] could drink and cuss and smoke and then
[37:00] up here's where you get to real holy go
[37:01] I know folks all that should have went
[37:05] away at sanctification before you get to
[37:09] the baptism of the holy go hey ma'am the
[37:12] cleaning of the stage is what we've
[37:14] always had wrong he said well I don't
[37:15] drink because I have the Holy Ghost no
[37:18] you don't drink on your thanks pot okay
[37:21] that all right go now here's eternal
[37:27] life now what happened in the garden was
[37:29] is that Satan brought his slant of the
[37:32] Word of God and God you know think about
[37:36] this morning when brother Dale was
[37:37] preaching what about a man that has so
[37:41] limited himself that there's not an
[37:44] atomic bomb in this world could blow up
[37:47] Jesus Christ there's not a chemical that
[37:50] you could create that would even harm
[37:52] him there our world
[37:55] that are floating around out there that
[37:57] God create this man Christ created yet
[38:02] he decided to come down in the human
[38:03] body and go through all this Willis he
[38:06] decided to show himself limit himself I
[38:09] mean the one that just brother Brown
[38:11] said when he saw Christ hanging out he
[38:13] said he didn't say a word to him to be
[38:15] low like he could create world just by
[38:17] looking at the man and here we got this
[38:19] man down to where he so in a simplified
[38:21] form he walked with us on the earth he
[38:24] talks with us on the earth he he came
[38:26] down in fellowship with us amen what a
[38:29] mighty God because that's low gosh this
[38:32] logos is was the speech that come out of
[38:34] God all right and then we called we
[38:37] brought in the theophany which the
[38:39] opening an Italian is Theo is God and
[38:43] financed the show so to show God all
[38:47] right so that's what happened in our
[38:50] mind
[38:51] remember in God's mind he never was all
[38:54] these floating like brother Dale was
[38:56] talking about he never was he always
[38:58] loved the man he always was eternal he
[39:01] always had these thoughts he always had
[39:04] these attributes
[39:05] he never gained anything amen he never
[39:09] gained one thing but for you and I to
[39:12] understand this man he had to step down
[39:15] not even down here he had to step down
[39:18] and and form so that you and I can see
[39:22] now see I can see even you go to Hebrews
[39:26] 10 and 5 a body thou has prepared me
[39:28] okay now we know that was the natural
[39:31] body of Jesus Christ but a body see it
[39:35] right here he's preparing me a body that
[39:38] theophany is that is that is God and all
[39:42] of his children
[39:43] and then you say well that's one listen
[39:47] God can be one and 10 million just like
[39:50] him and have the same theophany
[39:54] Christ created all things they men I
[39:58] thought Paul said it with Christ in you
[40:00] the hope of glory Christ in you somebody
[40:03] in India somebody and Africa somebody in
[40:05] Alaska
[40:06] at the same moment Christ in you the
[40:09] hope aboard it does not make him any
[40:11] smaller or it doesn't make him any less
[40:14] powerful you know what makes him that me
[40:21] and you that carnal mind that began
[40:24] right here that narrowed atom down to a
[40:27] place to where he couldn't even control
[40:29] the earth anymore
[40:30] he couldn't even control the earth
[40:32] anymore he was lost and and brother Ryan
[40:35] had asked that question I don't think I
[40:37] really covered it you can't lose your
[40:39] Genesis 1:26 that's eternal life what
[40:44] did Adam lose he lost fellowship Adam
[40:46] lost the connection he had with God
[40:48] before the fall he didn't lose his
[40:50] Genesis 1:26 man listen I'll read it
[40:54] here in just a minute
[40:55] that there was a cloud well I read it
[40:59] last Sunday there was a cloud that came
[41:01] over Adam to where it where did it come
[41:04] from
[41:06] right here Adam had never had to think
[41:10] about death before Adam had never had to
[41:13] think about children before him bringing
[41:15] them like by sex but he never had to
[41:18] think about a lion it was going to eat
[41:20] him he never had these thoughts he it
[41:22] was no fear but when all this happened
[41:25] he said I was afraid so when that fear
[41:29] came involved in God said where you
[41:31] argue at him he said I was afraid now
[41:33] before that Adam had no problem to walk
[41:35] straight up the dog and say hey daddy
[41:37] how you doing that's much of a
[41:40] relationship that's why we got to get
[41:42] back to that relationship I was telling
[41:45] Bob let me give you this little pointer
[41:47] and it may be totally wrong but it's
[41:49] just my fault anyway Paul went to the
[41:52] third heaven installed things that he
[41:53] could not talk about right why Paul was
[41:59] a prophet but remember Paul was not he
[42:04] didn't have the Bible to fall back on he
[42:06] was writing the Bible I want to know and
[42:10] I'm going to go back and look I'm study
[42:12] I want to know what this Corinthians was
[42:14] written before he went across or after
[42:19] because if he went across the curtain of
[42:22] time and saw things he couldn't talk
[42:23] about I'll guarantee when he came back
[42:26] to this earth he said for we know if
[42:29] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[42:31] we got one waiting cuz I saw it right
[42:37] that's what our deal is now people the
[42:41] book has been open Paul was writing the
[42:44] book all those Old Testament Saints was
[42:48] writing the book they were all writing
[42:50] the book that's why the prophet of God
[42:52] said everyone look to this day why
[42:56] because the books open we can understand
[42:58] we can even by even by natural thinking
[43:01] know that a prophet of God when he went
[43:03] across the curtain of time you know what
[43:05] he saw because he came back told her you
[43:07] know why cuz he could explain it Paul
[43:11] couldn't explain it but Paul maybe later
[43:15] on and I'm going to find out because it
[43:16] makes a lot of sense Paul went across
[43:18] and he's like because remember brother
[43:20] branham being a prophet up until 1960 he
[43:24] thought that if he went across a curtain
[43:26] the time for jokes daughters here hey
[43:29] how are you good to see you - hey it's
[43:34] good to see you again sure enough God
[43:36] bless you
[43:37] but brother Branham he thought that that
[43:40] if he went to heaven that he'd just be
[43:43] moving in a safe setting on a cloud but
[43:46] he said I'd see brother Neville and I
[43:47] said hey brother Neville couldn't shake
[43:49] his hand
[43:49] right that was his revelation at the
[43:52] time he didn't know like Paul he
[43:55] couldn't express that they got bodies
[43:58] like until he went there then when he
[44:04] went there and come back thank God he
[44:07] couldn't keep a secret when he came back
[44:09] he said I saw him and there and it's all
[44:13] that word that brother Branham had he
[44:15] could look back to Paul's writing in
[44:17] Corinthians and all these different ones
[44:19] and see that they were embodied he said
[44:21] they were what theophany they went sea
[44:24] off anybody's now I'm going to read it
[44:26] to you the minute we get to it but don't
[44:28] we'll get it next Sunday that brother
[44:31] Brown says I don't
[44:31] I don't get hung up on the material
[44:33] things I really don't like to say that
[44:37] I'm really not going to stay up at night
[44:41] and study about what that body's made of
[44:44] over there that's immaterial to me all I
[44:49] know is one thing for sure I got to feed
[44:51] it over here I got to make sure I got it
[44:53] over here and when I've got it over here
[44:56] if this earthly tabernacle dissolved I
[44:58] don't have one set up in a closet
[44:59] somewhere over in glory because remember
[45:02] it says eternal in the heavens
[45:05] but then this there's one that closed
[45:07] upon with our house which is from heaven
[45:09] it's got to be down here and then
[45:12] because from heaven is where this comes
[45:14] from and then that's where this come
[45:18] from when what happened was and we'll
[45:20] read it right here in just a second what
[45:22] happened was is this bar called time
[45:25] kept glide from coming down into a being
[45:30] human being the way he wanted to he
[45:35] couldn't get into the soul of man and
[45:37] listen the soul of man is not a spot I
[45:40] am my soul is me there's not a little
[45:43] dot right here the whole firing next
[45:47] mechanism of what you see is my Fiat me
[45:51] I'm not it's not it's not it's me go
[45:59] Jesus when he came back it was what him
[46:01] and then but God could not come he was
[46:06] barred by his own word I'll put enmity a
[46:10] division in other words I can't come
[46:12] through the way I want to come through
[46:14] but I'm coming anyway I'm coming anyway
[46:18] so what he does is he comes through the
[46:20] Old Testament as what Jehovah and all
[46:27] those titles
[46:29] now really not to correct you but I look
[46:34] it up the other day the it was Jay hv8
[46:37] is the way it was written
[46:40] instead of jb8 you it's Jay
[46:44] bah and what man done is put to eat the
[46:48] O and the a and made it Jehovah but the
[46:51] original was Jay h vh I looked it up in
[46:54] the Jewish website j h vh was the
[47:01] original they couldn't pronounce it so
[47:02] man put vowels in to make it geo and a
[47:07] to make it jehovah alright so now cuz
[47:12] you know what you got people that looks
[47:13] on the internet and they see something
[47:15] different they go why did you do that
[47:16] why did you saying that well that's what
[47:18] it is go there j HB h but man didn't
[47:22] understand it but what happened to this
[47:23] Jehovah God he comes down one time he
[47:27] comes down two times in a man called
[47:29] Melchizedek than all right now I'm going
[47:33] to pick a few because the three that I
[47:35] pick in the Old Testament is going to be
[47:38] ones that a body appeared to somebody
[47:42] not an angel
[47:45] listen an angel is not in that theophany
[47:50] light you and I are in that theophany
[47:51] because they don't have a soul remember
[47:53] brother Ron says even Satan didn't have
[47:57] soul takes an angel Saints not a man
[48:01] Satan is an angel angels are different
[48:04] he said angel heard everything man all
[48:06] right now so we come down with CML
[48:10] Cassidy Abraham made him in the first
[48:11] part of his journey amen which was what
[48:15] they brother Dale said this morning that
[48:16] was a pre figure of what Christ was
[48:20] going to be but that was not him because
[48:23] he could not die when he met Abraham he
[48:26] met him in a flesh body but it was not
[48:30] the flesh of God it was just never had
[48:38] brother Brown said he threw up some
[48:39] potassium and some potash and let it
[48:43] drift over his body and he walked up and
[48:45] met Abraham then he disappeared went
[48:48] right back into that theophany now
[48:51] remember I want to I want you to get
[48:52] something though God didn't lose
[48:53] anything
[48:55] when if all happen God didn't lose
[48:57] anything at all because I want to the
[48:59] full effect of the fall is how all this
[49:03] great beautiful picture that we're
[49:05] fixing to see came about without the
[49:08] fall you wouldn't have all these titles
[49:10] of God you wouldn't have us being lost
[49:15] and look back and need a savior like I
[49:18] said before the love of God put us on
[49:20] freewill and man the love of God gave us
[49:23] a choice and listen the only way you can
[49:26] have a choice is to have a soul
[49:28] animals don't have a choice they don't
[49:30] have a soul but that soul we're going to
[49:33] read in a minute is the theophany listen
[49:37] Adolf Hitler had a soul that came from
[49:42] God yes he did sure he did you should
[49:47] all like to show God yeah I did but put
[49:51] him on free moral agency to choose
[49:54] whether he continues on that path I'll
[49:57] read it in the minute I got quote and
[49:59] this is what I believe anyway a sinner
[50:02] hasn't the awesome cuz it's the farm
[50:05] into the ant it's a soul it's a soul you
[50:10] only you can't have a soul and not make
[50:13] a choice so God put everybody in one
[50:16] place give everybody a soul and attacks
[50:21] our nature to that soul I'll read it a
[50:23] minute go that's your old atomic nature
[50:26] that's the nature of the Fallen part
[50:28] that you come you come follow all right
[50:31] go down no calves ain't met Abraham then
[50:36] milk I didn't met Abraham again at the
[50:40] end of his journey right when he was 99
[50:43] years old made him at the end of the
[50:45] journey told him all these things so
[50:47] there's two times that God comes down in
[50:49] that King theophany puts on a little
[50:54] dust and shows yourself
[50:56] give him a pre figure actually to me he
[51:00] hid himself he didn't reveal itself he
[51:02] hid himself he was revealing himself to
[51:05] Abraham because Abraham said Lord
[51:08] a man nobody else around him had a
[51:10] revelation he said Lord now then works
[51:14] the next one
[51:16] Moses obviously and then and I came upon
[51:21] something last night what do some study
[51:22] we might find something I know if you go
[51:27] to that word when Moses when the book
[51:30] the Bible says the bush was on fire okay
[51:34] it says the bush was on fire now let me
[51:38] tell you what the Hebrew let's consider
[51:39] bout that word fire that word fire pull
[51:42] it up
[51:43] it's Hebrew look right here they
[51:56] interpreted that as a theophany was
[52:00] accompanying this supernatural fire we
[52:03] know it was we know what we know Moses
[52:05] saw the fire Moses heard the voice but
[52:08] behind that fire was that King theophany
[52:12] that was Almighty God that was the I am
[52:14] of the I am he was standing there
[52:18] he was the accompanying theophany of
[52:20] what what he was is in Moses in
[52:22] revelation at the time God was hid God
[52:27] was hid hiding himself in simplicity but
[52:33] what revealing himself because what
[52:34] happened to Moses later on Moses comes
[52:37] up one day and and says God I saw you in
[52:41] the bush I went to Egypt and I spoke
[52:45] everything you told me to say
[52:46] I brought these bunch of rebels out here
[52:49] you've told me to speak to them I've
[52:51] done things right I've done things wrong
[52:52] but I want to see who you are I want to
[52:56] see you I want to actually not just
[52:58] understand you I want to physically see
[53:00] you so God said okay go hide yourself in
[53:04] the cleft of the rock we know the story
[53:05] and when he saw that body go by he
[53:08] didn't see some floating body the Bible
[53:13] says he saw the back part of AMA n now
[53:18] you say well what was that
[53:20] with Jesus Christ not in his human form
[53:25] at the time but that was mr. King
[53:27] theophany showing himself to Moses hey
[53:31] man he come down out of returning he's
[53:33] the only one that can move I'm still I'm
[53:35] still working on those dimensions
[53:37] because God in the seventh dimension no
[53:39] one can go there but he can go anywhere
[53:41] he wants to so he stepped out of that
[53:43] seventh dimension down into higher
[53:45] dimension and showed this up just a
[53:47] little bit and I promise you one thing
[53:51] I don't think Moses was surprised
[53:55] I don't think Moses was going to expect
[53:59] some ball of light to go by or some bush
[54:03] burning do you know walk my friend when
[54:06] he saw that man he said that's what I
[54:08] thought you would that's what I thought
[54:10] you would you talk to me like a man so
[54:13] you must be a man can you seem like that
[54:18] can you see with all this revelation we
[54:21] got so it struck me the other day when
[54:24] brother Dale says do you see when you
[54:26] pray do you pray to somebody or you just
[54:27] praying we eyes close and it's just out
[54:30] into the hello somebody or you just do
[54:36] like I'm doing now I'm just going to
[54:38] talk to him
[54:39] I don't have to close my eyes I don't
[54:41] have to close my eyes we do by we do in
[54:43] reverence listen we do in reverence
[54:46] let's don't be let's don't have a
[54:47] preacher come up here and he said let's
[54:49] bow our head and pray and everybody's
[54:50] going no bow your head in reverence but
[54:55] when you talk to God and you need to
[54:57] talk to him I've had to talk to him on
[54:59] my lawnmower now like brother Ryan said
[55:00] that's my burning bush is my lawnmower
[55:03] now if I close my eyes I'd probably run
[55:05] over Susan's plants and she'd kill me
[55:08] I'd see my king tee off and he real
[55:10] quick but I keep my eyes open while I'm
[55:13] praying without ceasing I'm talking I'm
[55:17] talking to the man I'm not talking to
[55:19] some spirit or some or some Idol or I'm
[55:22] talking to you know why because I know
[55:24] who I'm talking to
[55:26] Moses finally he says god I want to see
[55:29] who I'm talking to and then he sees the
[55:31] man
[55:33] saw him in that supernatural fire listen
[55:36] Moses what a dummy he knew that if that
[55:38] Bush wasn't consumed it had to be a
[55:40] supernatural fire and there had to be a
[55:43] supernatural being behind that part but
[55:46] when God stepped out of that and just
[55:48] said okay Moses I'm going to walk by
[55:51] animal what you see can't let you see my
[55:52] faith I'll let you see my nowhere so the
[55:56] incense shadow it's a shadow he's gone
[56:00] man he said why was he in flash again
[56:04] who cares who cares I don't care I don't
[56:09] I don't I'm not gonna sit here and worry
[56:12] about what this the off anybody's made
[56:14] out of there's only one thing I know for
[56:16] sure that them across the curtain of
[56:18] time we're solid is this table and they
[56:22] need a flesh body when they come back
[56:24] here and that's the thing that we're
[56:27] going to live through eternity because
[56:28] brother Ron said they're not in their
[56:30] right to be conditioned so there's a
[56:31] part of them that's still here with the
[56:33] connection we'll get to that in a minute
[56:35] everybody all right say man all right so
[56:38] now who's the next one the next one is a
[56:41] man named Joshua Joshua 5:13 let's read
[56:45] that I wonder I want you to see
[56:47] something you think well maybe this is
[56:48] just somebody that Joshua saw but watch
[56:50] what happens so you have to look at the
[56:52] character in the attribute behind what
[56:56] happened with Joshua same thing with
[56:58] Moses don't just take Moses for his word
[57:00] Moses saw the back part of a man Joshua
[57:04] this is after they had the scripture
[57:07] before that if they had just went into
[57:09] the Promised Land they were eating the
[57:11] old court of the land everything was
[57:13] good because they were getting
[57:14] everything together and it came to pass
[57:15] when Joshua was by Jericho that he
[57:18] lifted up his eyes and looked and behold
[57:19] there stood a spook there stood a light
[57:24] there stood a burning bush there's to
[57:28] the man over against him with a short
[57:31] draw this guy was doing he wasn't just
[57:33] standing now you meant business but why
[57:36] was he there watch and Joshua went unto
[57:39] him and said unto Him art thou for us or
[57:41] for I ever said you know what didn't
[57:44] have a revelation at that moment
[57:46] who he
[57:47] talking to you because you don't ask god
[57:50] those questions right
[57:51] no but God's got that amazing grace
[57:56] lluís amazing wake up so you hear one
[57:59] thing are you for us are you for
[58:02] adversary and watch when he speaks but
[58:05] Nathan Nate but as captain of the host
[58:08] of the Capitol lor DMI now come and
[58:13] Joshua would have not worshiped this
[58:16] being had it not been God and then had
[58:19] he not been King theophanies Joshua
[58:21] would not have got that watch he fell on
[58:23] his face of the earth and did worship
[58:25] and said unto Him what staff my lord
[58:28] unto his servant and the captain of the
[58:30] Lord's host said unto joshua loose thy
[58:32] shoes have you ever heard this before
[58:35] have you ever heard this before that
[58:37] same I am told Moses to take your shoes
[58:40] off Oh your foot for the place whereon
[58:44] thou standest is holy and Joshua did so
[58:46] remember Joshua not not degrading Moses
[58:49] but Moses was a prophet Moses couldn't
[58:52] go across the promised land but Joshua
[58:53] it's a type of the baptism of the Holy
[58:55] Ghost
[58:56] Joshua is a type of the placing of the
[58:58] people in the land
[58:59] so his revelation showed him immediately
[59:01] a man face-to-face and then and he got
[59:05] down in worship this man knowing that
[59:07] was Almighty God and when he said loose
[59:10] your shoes I don't think Joshua took his
[59:13] time I think he kicked them off or in
[59:16] the bushes somewhere because he knew he
[59:18] was in the presence of Almighty God but
[59:24] where did that captain of the host go he
[59:27] dropped that body went right back into
[59:28] the in another dimension
[59:30] Amen so he showed himself several times
[59:34] down through the Old Testament but
[59:36] remember the proper God told us that
[59:41] Melchizedek became Jesus Christ a man
[59:46] not another person by a different person
[59:49] that's why he could stand and say before
[59:52] Abraham was I am
[59:55] because he'd been there he'd been
[59:57] aligned if he had to be a man he would
[1:00:01] have been lying if he said well I know
[1:00:03] he knew and we read it in just a little
[1:00:06] while maybe we connect Sunday on who dis
[1:00:08] Melchizedek that's why Jesus he came
[1:00:11] here the Word of God we had to be made
[1:00:15] into the image we had to be made the
[1:00:17] Word of God we didn't come here to word
[1:00:19] a god man is that all right listen we
[1:00:26] didn't come here special now in the mind
[1:00:30] of God we were special in the mind of
[1:00:32] God we were absolutely already saved
[1:00:35] sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:36] and already sit in heavenly place but
[1:00:39] now he's up here and we're down here
[1:00:42] he's looking through he's looking
[1:00:44] through his he's looking through what he
[1:00:46] has always got to look back to the word
[1:00:49] there's therefore now no condemnation we
[1:00:52] have to start looking back toward the
[1:00:54] word look at that word of God look at
[1:00:57] the word let the word tell us what we
[1:00:58] are instead of us going oh smoke I don't
[1:01:04] drink I don't come I go to church I
[1:01:06] believe the Prophet devil does too he's
[1:01:14] on top of the list he gets here to
[1:01:16] church for you too and he never goes to
[1:01:19] sleep never goes to sleep but he's not
[1:01:25] the flesh body either so I know you live
[1:01:27] in a flesh body so that's all right
[1:01:29] but the Word of God King theophany now
[1:01:31] did it stop any of this no no it just
[1:01:34] kept unfolding yourself down through
[1:01:36] Moses but remember one thing's for sure
[1:01:40] one thing's for sure no one in this time
[1:01:44] period had that Genesis 1:26 men in
[1:01:47] their soul Moses as great as he was had
[1:01:52] an anointing Joshua had an anointing
[1:01:58] they all had an anointing but they were
[1:02:01] not sons and daughters of God they were
[1:02:03] not part of this Genesis 1:26 man
[1:02:09] but remember because of that Genesis
[1:02:11] 1:26 man because of the word that was
[1:02:14] spoken already like I telling them this
[1:02:16] morning we're on the fifth seal because
[1:02:18] of the word of God God God has got to
[1:02:21] give that fifth seal Jew eternal life
[1:02:22] you say you can't make God listen you
[1:02:26] can make God do something call him on
[1:02:29] his word you have if you program take
[1:02:32] God's love for you to tell him what he's
[1:02:35] worth then why call him on the word that
[1:02:38] fits healed you you've shown me one
[1:02:40] thing why they should have eternal life
[1:02:41] show me one they know one there's not
[1:02:44] one there do so what but God said I'll
[1:02:50] not forget that's how they get it God
[1:02:55] said I blinded you
[1:02:56] so that you can come in that's why I
[1:02:58] told them this morning I said let's not
[1:02:59] be so let's don't put that fifth seal
[1:03:02] Jew down if they hadn't been a fifth
[1:03:06] seal Jew
[1:03:06] they went to be in Genesis 1:26 man they
[1:03:10] wouldn't been a Gentile bride called out
[1:03:13] in the church ages it would have been
[1:03:15] the Jews would have accepted Christ at
[1:03:17] Calvary and then they would have went
[1:03:19] right on into the Millennium because
[1:03:20] remember the Millennium is not to us
[1:03:22] it's to the Jews so there wouldn't have
[1:03:26] been like I said last Sunday they
[1:03:27] wouldn't have been the gap where the
[1:03:28] seven church ages are you'd have Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ here died they accepted him and
[1:03:32] go right there
[1:03:33] and then go right in the Millennium but
[1:03:37] no he blinded them for seven churches
[1:03:40] right therefore he said I will not
[1:03:43] forget
[1:03:44] now Israel you went whoring Israel I
[1:03:48] divorced you but I won't forget you
[1:03:51] you'll be servants now you won't be my
[1:03:54] children and then that all right so then
[1:03:57] we see this theophany now watch this the
[1:04:00] object in theophany is she showing
[1:04:02] itself but he's having to leave he's
[1:04:04] showing himself but he's having to leave
[1:04:06] a man he can't come down and reside in a
[1:04:11] human being because remember the blood
[1:04:18] of bulls and goats never eradicated sin
[1:04:22] it covered it you still had I'm still
[1:04:28] with dark but it covered it so God
[1:04:29] what'd he do he saw that he had to he
[1:04:32] had to come off at Judgment he had to
[1:04:36] come off that judgment he if we ni seize
[1:04:39] the blood he couldn't cross that Sistine
[1:04:42] there's no way doesn't matter what was
[1:04:45] behind that door he told them put to put
[1:04:47] the blood over the doorpost and I will
[1:04:50] pass over you he had to do what his word
[1:04:54] said so that's what he did he just kept
[1:04:57] till he comes down to one place where
[1:05:02] this King theophany finally became flesh
[1:05:04] in Jesus Christ now I'm just gonna make
[1:05:06] a cross okay that all right let's read
[1:05:10] Isaiah 9:6 now here see you wouldn't had
[1:05:13] any of this you wouldn't had any of what
[1:05:17] I'm fixing to read for unto us a child
[1:05:19] is born unto us a son is given here's
[1:05:22] the full effect to the fall he didn't
[1:05:24] have to come hadn't been to fall right
[1:05:27] Bryan to us a child is born unto us a
[1:05:29] son is given them the government shall
[1:05:31] be upon his shoulder his name should be
[1:05:33] called a wonderful called wonderful
[1:05:35] counselor mighty God everlasting father
[1:05:37] Prince of Peace of the increase of his
[1:05:39] government and peace there should be no
[1:05:41] end upon the throne of David and upon
[1:05:43] his kingdom to order it and establish it
[1:05:45] with judgment and with justice from
[1:05:46] henceforth even forever the zeal of the
[1:05:49] Lord of hosts will perform this now
[1:05:52] let's go to isaiah 44:24
[1:05:55] next one thus saith the LORD thy
[1:05:58] Redeemer and he that formed thee from
[1:06:00] the womb
[1:06:00] I am the Lord that maketh all things
[1:06:03] that stretches forth the heavens alone
[1:06:05] that spreadeth abroad the earth by
[1:06:07] myself he don't need no other like I
[1:06:10] said this great guy try to think about
[1:06:12] that sometime think about a God that you
[1:06:15] could you know all the horribleness that
[1:06:17] we could throw at him doing flinch all
[1:06:21] the horribleness that Satan can throw
[1:06:23] all the horribleness that man could
[1:06:26] throw at God not going to hurt that King
[1:06:32] theophany there's nothing ever hurt this
[1:06:35] King t
[1:06:36] this King theophany never fails it don't
[1:06:39] fall and man there's no fall in it
[1:06:42] that's why I said once we realized that
[1:06:44] when we come to a place that that thing
[1:06:47] resides and we got to go back to that we
[1:06:52] got to go back to that that's what we
[1:06:54] got to go back to because the words that
[1:06:56] multiply and replenish the earth that's
[1:06:58] what we're doing right now Bob and I
[1:07:05] were talking to the back Paul the great
[1:07:06] Apostle Paul he's going to be a prophet
[1:07:09] he's going to write 80 percent of the
[1:07:10] Bible yet he needed somebody from the
[1:07:12] body not another prophet not a preacher
[1:07:15] God said and now I'm gonna send you
[1:07:20] somebody and Ananias is like really Lord
[1:07:28] that guy's kid that guy's killing us he
[1:07:32] said I won't use lay hands on him he
[1:07:34] said cuz the Holy Ghost has got to come
[1:07:36] through the body and you are the only
[1:07:39] one that I can trust to do that or he
[1:07:42] would ask somebody else
[1:07:43] so I said about brother Branham he
[1:07:45] couldn't he's nobody could have been the
[1:07:47] prophet in this age for him because
[1:07:48] because he's the one that fits the bill
[1:07:50] he's the one that fit everything God
[1:07:52] needed right regardless of the things he
[1:07:55] did that we say was wrong come on big
[1:07:58] deal he fits the bill he fit the word
[1:08:01] perfect he was absolutely a word prophet
[1:08:05] because he came by the Word of God and
[1:08:07] man the only thing is is I don't believe
[1:08:09] he was deity because he came to a second
[1:08:11] sex birth okay
[1:08:14] he had deity residing in him but he was
[1:08:17] not did he no way no he had babies I'm
[1:08:21] sorry he was a baby and he made babies
[1:08:23] so that's Jesus Christ never did both of
[1:08:25] those so that made him did he
[1:08:28] Christ was did he ma'am because he came
[1:08:32] here
[1:08:33] he came here with us in him we didn't
[1:08:37] come here with him in us and man that
[1:08:40] all right okay all right so now we come
[1:08:43] to Jesus Christ there is King theophany
[1:08:45] and I love like I said before
[1:08:49] except the atom for a minute Adam was
[1:08:52] the god of the earth
[1:08:53] I had him had complete rulership but he
[1:08:56] was not the God he was not this Great
[1:08:58] King theophany he was part of that
[1:09:01] theophany you and I are part of that t
[1:09:04] oppan e we're tied back to the eternal
[1:09:06] the property God said amen
[1:09:08] but Adam lost it or forfeited the right
[1:09:11] to bring all this to pass he forfeited
[1:09:16] he gave the book back to God which was
[1:09:19] what book of names it was the book of
[1:09:20] life eternal section okay alright cuz it
[1:09:26] look this right here is the eternal
[1:09:29] section of that book God himself
[1:09:32] there's a book that's got life in it
[1:09:35] that God said if you put to see if you
[1:09:37] put a seed in the spurt or a sperm of
[1:09:38] the egg together it makes a baby I'm
[1:09:40] going to give it life so he says bring
[1:09:44] forth life okay that's what's that whoop
[1:09:45] we're not gonna get to it because I'm
[1:09:47] gonna stop in a few minutes we'll get to
[1:09:48] it next Sunday because I haven't even
[1:09:50] read one of the fifth in quotes yet but
[1:09:52] it's not alright do we need that we need
[1:09:54] them to back up what I just said okay
[1:09:57] you don't need them if you listen to
[1:09:59] what I'm saying run it through your
[1:10:02] filter a man run it through your filter
[1:10:06] and don't get your own idea or your own
[1:10:10] slant just listen to what's being said
[1:10:13] don't worry about what that see often is
[1:10:15] that the opening to me is a body made by
[1:10:18] the Word of God it cannot be touched by
[1:10:21] human hands it cannot be made by human
[1:10:24] hands it has to come from right here
[1:10:31] tell you some people when we find out
[1:10:33] that we come straight from God now
[1:10:36] remember we're going to see something
[1:10:37] we'll read it next Sunday we didn't come
[1:10:39] straight from God in the theophany
[1:10:41] we came down here in flesh we came down
[1:10:44] here lost we came down here with a
[1:10:46] nature attached to our soul
[1:10:49] I'll read it next Sunday brother brems
[1:10:51] tells us it was all smutty blackened
[1:10:54] marg God can't touch an unclean vessel
[1:10:58] right maybe he can't dwell an unclean
[1:10:59] vessel but he can't clean that vessel up
[1:11:03] because I'm gonna read you with the
[1:11:05] Liddell's talking long time ago about
[1:11:07] Holy Ghost and fire
[1:11:09] there's your burner it burns that nature
[1:11:14] off of you and kills it it don't kill
[1:11:16] your soul it just kills the nature what
[1:11:21] that you drop smoke run around you know
[1:11:23] here we go with list again the number
[1:11:26] one thing you make a list but when I was
[1:11:28] out in the world doing the things of the
[1:11:30] world I wasn't here so there's my list
[1:11:34] one left I wasn't a believer and man I
[1:11:39] wasn't under what I wasn't under the
[1:11:41] leadership of the Holy Spirit I was
[1:11:43] under the leadership of a spirit all
[1:11:44] right but it wasn't holy a man's all
[1:11:48] right
[1:11:48] so this King theophany now comes down
[1:11:51] here in human flesh now he has a body
[1:11:54] that came from God
[1:11:56] and it started as a baby that all right
[1:12:00] came as a baby just like me and you
[1:12:02] because the kids went had to be kin to
[1:12:06] me in you I know this is elementary but
[1:12:07] it's got you got to bring it into the
[1:12:09] story that the entire Godhead dwelled in
[1:12:12] that baby and he came here with King
[1:12:16] theophany already in place amen
[1:12:20] I love that why you can't fail with that
[1:12:23] what if we're to come that way but we
[1:12:27] could because we spawn on this he was
[1:12:31] born on this end that's why it's called
[1:12:35] fall we fell we fell from what coming
[1:12:41] this way to where we had to come see if
[1:12:46] God didn't I didn't have a crisis
[1:12:49] meeting in heaven God didn't have to
[1:12:50] worry about anything he said okay Satan
[1:12:54] that's all right
[1:12:56] you have just revealed more of me you
[1:13:00] have just made me more you've expanded
[1:13:04] me more than would've it's we to come
[1:13:06] this way around here you played right
[1:13:08] into my plan you played right into my
[1:13:11] hands and you might think that you
[1:13:14] stopped the son and daughter of God
[1:13:15] being born the way they're supposed to
[1:13:17] be but I'm going to use that thing that
[1:13:19] you used the sex and I'm going to bring
[1:13:22] my children here anyway
[1:13:23] in continuance where I was I fashion
[1:13:28] right right the only problem is we had
[1:13:36] to come through death
[1:13:37] we had to come through the death part
[1:13:39] all right we had to come to the death
[1:13:41] part but we had a redeemer and what did
[1:13:48] he do remember remember and I'll bring
[1:13:51] it next Sunday and adoption brother
[1:13:53] Brown said Jesus Christ did not come to
[1:13:55] bring you an inheritance
[1:13:57] well that's boy when you preach that in
[1:13:59] different places they like who you reach
[1:14:01] what the prophecy and the Dobson series
[1:14:04] brother Brown said Jesus Christ did not
[1:14:06] come to bring you an inheritance what
[1:14:11] did Adam lose Adam didn't lose his
[1:14:12] inheritance he had eternal life he just
[1:14:16] lost the way remember he was pushed out
[1:14:18] of the garden and the Flaming Gorge what
[1:14:21] guarded the way back in well then Christ
[1:14:26] became the way to what bring us right
[1:14:29] back bring us right back he made the way
[1:14:34] for us to get back because look he
[1:14:37] didn't come down here and say well I'm
[1:14:39] going down I'm going to I'm bringing you
[1:14:41] something new that ain't knew he was
[1:14:45] back here he knew what he was doing he
[1:14:48] knew he was breaking the seal open that
[1:14:51] had been sealed up from right here all
[1:14:52] the way to here that seal was broke in
[1:14:55] Jesus Christ remember he is the seal hey
[1:14:58] man so what did he break he broke the
[1:15:01] seal so that you and I can get right
[1:15:03] back to this spot right here
[1:15:04] amen then on the day of Pentecost that's
[1:15:08] what happened that King theophany
[1:15:11] started spreading himself out just
[1:15:15] exactly the way it was going to happen
[1:15:16] in the Garden of Eden but there was a
[1:15:19] fall we had to contend with but still
[1:15:22] that's exactly the way
[1:15:25] that it would be a man let's try to read
[1:15:29] one or two and this is just going to
[1:15:34] reiterate what I said but let's read
[1:15:37] them anyway
[1:15:38] number one entombment 1957 okay let's
[1:15:48] just read the the read the entire
[1:15:50] Godhead was in him he was both Father
[1:15:54] Son and Holy Ghost but dwelt in a human
[1:15:56] form the theophany of gloves a great
[1:15:59] image of God that he made man in then
[1:16:02] placed him in the earth he had a body
[1:16:05] God isn't without a body listen God has
[1:16:09] never been without a body
[1:16:11] God has a body it's like God is not it's
[1:16:15] like Rodell see God is not he doesn't
[1:16:17] have a soul this whole being is the soul
[1:16:20] of God he doesn't see we st. we look at
[1:16:23] that we go why remember we were
[1:16:25] separated we were separated we fell that
[1:16:30] never failed so when we get back
[1:16:33] listen to me now when we get back to the
[1:16:36] future' home I'm just going to say that
[1:16:37] because that's the very end because we
[1:16:39] do in the Millennium actually we do here
[1:16:41] we go back to the original right here
[1:16:44] right before we go home we go but let's
[1:16:47] just put it on into the look on end of
[1:16:49] the moment let's say the Millennium when
[1:16:51] we get into Millennium that's exactly
[1:16:53] what would walk the earth body spirit
[1:16:56] and soul eternal that's what a body
[1:17:00] changes people that's why people are
[1:17:02] just going to be hard to make a body
[1:17:04] change can be hard but somebody is going
[1:17:07] to do it because of one little scripture
[1:17:09] we which are alive and remain listen if
[1:17:14] Jesus resurrected on one Scripture we're
[1:17:17] going to take a body change on one
[1:17:19] Scripture and it's just a piece of
[1:17:21] Scripture amen all right so God's got a
[1:17:25] body and it looks like a man Moses saw
[1:17:26] it others saw it and it looks like a man
[1:17:28] and let's now watch and it's just an
[1:17:31] impression this is of what that is and
[1:17:34] everything on earth the beauty the
[1:17:36] sweetness the beauty of the earth is
[1:17:38] nothing
[1:17:38] in the world but an answer to a far
[1:17:40] better than that
[1:17:42] that weights us when we leave this world
[1:17:44] for everything in earth is just a
[1:17:47] pattern of that which is in heaven
[1:17:48] everything that's good everything this
[1:17:51] righteous never clean this beautiful
[1:17:52] trees birds everything is just a pattern
[1:17:55] of what's in heaven our own life is just
[1:17:58] a pattern it's just a shadow remember we
[1:18:02] got to realize one thing when God the
[1:18:04] probably God said that God took a
[1:18:06] picture of us at our prime of life 18 to
[1:18:10] 20 years old before the foundation of
[1:18:12] the world he didn't wait till you got
[1:18:14] down here and got 18 to 20 years old
[1:18:17] right there is your picture when he said
[1:18:22] Genesis 1:26 when he said let us make
[1:18:25] man in our own image the real guy is all
[1:18:33] I wasn't back there no you weren't back
[1:18:35] there you were nothing but right there
[1:18:37] in the mind of God yes you where you
[1:18:38] were is real more real than you are
[1:18:41] right now didn't get many men's on that
[1:18:47] one but we were listen we kind of know
[1:18:51] we came from somewhere right I know for
[1:18:54] a fact I didn't come here with eternal
[1:18:56] life but now that I have eternal life I
[1:18:58] know where it came from I know where it
[1:19:02] came from our old life was just a
[1:19:06] pattern it's just a shadow and not the
[1:19:09] real thing so that eighteen to twenty
[1:19:10] years old like I said he didn't wait to
[1:19:12] take that picture down here he preserved
[1:19:14] that thing way back over here put that
[1:19:17] thing in an album and said I have so
[1:19:21] much patience I'm going to wait six
[1:19:24] thousand years ten thousand years
[1:19:27] eighty-five million years but it's gonna
[1:19:30] come to pass because you know what's
[1:19:32] eighty-five million years to eternal
[1:19:34] person our own life is just a pattern
[1:19:38] it's just a shadow not the real thing
[1:19:40] it's the negative side see we take all
[1:19:45] we're piloting this is the positive
[1:19:46] edges no it's totally the negative
[1:19:51] of what God saw oh right there because
[1:19:53] remember this is not supposed to come
[1:19:55] like it did this is not the perfect will
[1:19:58] of God
[1:19:58] this is a permissive will of God and man
[1:20:00] the perfect will of God is his word the
[1:20:02] permissive wheels all this other stuff
[1:20:03] down here and then we spoke on that many
[1:20:06] times it takes death to develop the
[1:20:08] picture to put us back in the theophany
[1:20:10] we came from then in the resurrection we
[1:20:14] come in his likeness a resurrect no up
[1:20:16] you shall we go all look like Jesus well
[1:20:18] they don't even that's not even what he
[1:20:20] looks like now he's 20 years old now
[1:20:23] he's not 33 or whatever that is he's not
[1:20:25] that but that's the picture of him when
[1:20:27] he wasn't here on earth that's what I
[1:20:30] said before listen listen when you got
[1:20:35] born again you got a body change
[1:20:39] that's the oppening body that burnt that
[1:20:42] old nature off you become an 18 year old
[1:20:44] person you had to because I want to read
[1:20:50] you if I get to it I'm going to read you
[1:20:51] where brother Brown said when he went to
[1:20:53] hell he saw young and old he didn't say
[1:20:56] that in a six dimension right he said
[1:20:59] they were all young he said but when I
[1:21:01] went to hell I saw him young I saw old
[1:21:04] people why listen the benefit of us
[1:21:08] being at Genesis 1:26 man is that we are
[1:21:11] young and then what we're going to if
[1:21:14] you don't if you leave that nature at
[1:21:16] old nature attached to that soul God
[1:21:19] give you God can't say that he can't go
[1:21:21] over that any more he winks in our
[1:21:24] ignorance at one time but now we know
[1:21:26] how to take that came right then in the
[1:21:29] resurrection when we come in his
[1:21:31] likeness a resurrected body what a
[1:21:32] beautiful not only beautiful but it's
[1:21:34] the real solemn truth of God's eternal
[1:21:37] word that will be like him why was going
[1:21:39] to be like him because like like bow
[1:21:41] still said that poor old man that said
[1:21:44] that this morning they said that
[1:21:46] yesterday he's 85 years old he's about
[1:21:48] blind so he thought I was daddy and
[1:21:50] dated with me I met he you can't
[1:21:54] I get out a lot of things you know it
[1:22:02] mister Charlie's a good guy he's really
[1:22:04] nice to us so I'm not grading him a bit
[1:22:06] he's a really nice guy but he can't see
[1:22:09] worth the flip and I'll tell him the
[1:22:12] next time I say but look this man right
[1:22:16] here doesn't get old and and and young
[1:22:19] and old and young that's God
[1:22:21] who wants a God with a gray beard and
[1:22:24] walks like this no I want a young God
[1:22:28] that skips the Bible says to skip like a
[1:22:31] lamb and do all these wonderful things
[1:22:34] that's the kind of God I want I want a
[1:22:35] guard with some youth to it I'm getting
[1:22:38] old Rolaids getting old here though yeah
[1:22:44] you're right about that
[1:22:45] all right look let's read this right
[1:22:48] here and then we'll stop we'll get this
[1:22:50] next Sunday that's only half of what I
[1:22:52] had so go yeah that's good
[1:22:58] entomb yeah number two let's read this
[1:23:00] one here he goes where did he leave when
[1:23:03] he left now I want to talk to you about
[1:23:04] just for a minute and then we're going
[1:23:06] to stop this is the quarter one read
[1:23:10] here he goes where did he leave when he
[1:23:12] left the Bible said he ascended he went
[1:23:15] and preached to the souls that were in
[1:23:16] prison that repented not in the
[1:23:18] long-suffering of the days of Noah his
[1:23:21] soul his spirit his theophany of his own
[1:23:23] being went down so now look that's the
[1:23:27] complete package
[1:23:28] he left his earthly body up in the tomb
[1:23:33] see see brothers and sisters that's our
[1:23:36] sacrifice the theophany didn't bleed the
[1:23:40] theophany never died the body died just
[1:23:45] like those sacrifices back in this back
[1:23:47] in the Old Testament the body died so
[1:23:50] his body died is our sacrifice but he
[1:23:53] gave his soul ransom his soul went to
[1:23:57] hell and if that is the oppening and if
[1:24:00] that's just the opening it's the same
[1:24:02] you and I went with him
[1:24:04] right but Larry we don't have to go to
[1:24:07] hell him or we already been we've lifted
[1:24:10] on you laughs but I see that as
[1:24:12] something personal I don't have to go to
[1:24:15] hell because I went to hell already with
[1:24:17] him and I was so protected I wasn't
[1:24:21] scared
[1:24:21] God didn't go down to then awesome Gaga
[1:24:24] goat I was able to lay I got told all
[1:24:26] these people and he's shaking like no
[1:24:27] same way when I told him this morning
[1:24:30] about laughs about Legion Jesus didn't
[1:24:33] step this foot off that boat and go
[1:24:35] there's a bunch of Devils on that island
[1:24:37] hunting come he's thinking think about
[1:24:39] it he just stepped on out and they went
[1:24:43] to screaming he didn't hey man that's
[1:24:46] what we're coming to folks I'm telling
[1:24:48] you because that thing that's scaring us
[1:24:50] we got to get rid of we got to get rid
[1:24:53] of that thing that scared us that
[1:24:55] repented not the long suffering the days
[1:24:57] of Noah his soul his spirit his
[1:24:58] theophany of his own being went down
[1:25:00] now let's follow him but roll it back up
[1:25:02] I keep going yeah we okay now look he
[1:25:14] tells us just below the reasons a mortal
[1:25:16] being lays the realm of demon power
[1:25:18] below that just above that lace the
[1:25:21] souls are then just so below it lays the
[1:25:26] very domain of Satan he'll then just
[1:25:29] above us lays the Holy Spirit then under
[1:25:32] the altar lays the souls of the just men
[1:25:34] the next is God himself that's up in the
[1:25:36] seventh dimension one going downward one
[1:25:39] going upward the two spirits are here on
[1:25:42] earth influencing the people of this
[1:25:45] earth now keep going now look this is
[1:25:49] where I want to show you something when
[1:25:50] Jesus died he goes up down there I can
[1:25:52] see him on that Friday afternoon after
[1:25:54] his death by the RAM knock knocks on the
[1:25:57] door of the regions of the Lost
[1:25:58] let's follow him a minute the door opens
[1:26:01] there was women there was men there were
[1:26:05] young ladies there were old they weren't
[1:26:12] all in his prime of their youth the way
[1:26:15] they died but what brother Brown say I
[1:26:17] think after this
[1:26:18] and offices whichever way the tree leans
[1:26:20] that's where false they were old there
[1:26:24] were all together in that hideous place
[1:26:27] called the prison of the lost soul
[1:26:30] man so we don't want things for sure he
[1:26:35] didn't see that in the six dimension
[1:26:37] he saw everybody young everybody happy
[1:26:41] everybody rejoicing he saw everybody in
[1:26:44] what in their prime he didn't say that
[1:26:49] about these people why because they
[1:26:51] didn't accept the sacrifice amen now hey
[1:26:56] can y'all switch to one more and then
[1:26:58] I'll quit right hand will go back to
[1:27:00] read this let me find it real quick
[1:27:11] go to number nine and then I'll prove
[1:27:18] all this other stuff later about the
[1:27:20] nature because I got it all right here
[1:27:21] you know me I don't come up here with
[1:27:23] with nothing all right come on come up
[1:27:25] come on here his body was in the grave
[1:27:29] and his soul was in Hell preaching alive
[1:27:32] what about that he was in his theophany
[1:27:36] this is from questions and answers on
[1:27:37] Hebrews 1957 he was in its theophany
[1:27:40] again okay his soul was down there with
[1:27:44] those people that were in the opening
[1:27:47] also dinner has a theophany
[1:27:51] you sawing off the often is God be
[1:27:56] careful be careful there's to life a
[1:28:01] permitted life and then they'd eternal
[1:28:03] life man
[1:28:04] all right now what we'll explain later
[1:28:05] also and was witnessing to them that
[1:28:08] they repented not in the long-suffering
[1:28:10] now if you take that and you see that
[1:28:13] what God did we'll put this back
[1:28:15] together and then we'll start next
[1:28:16] Sunday what God did is God gave us a
[1:28:21] choice when we got here we're all
[1:28:24] because we do have a soul and I don't
[1:28:26] want I don't like going that's not a
[1:28:28] soul a soul it's me
[1:28:32] right like I said before Seoul is not
[1:28:34] some little spot I got in my heart no
[1:28:39] it's me you see me moving my souls
[1:28:40] moving you see me talking my soul is
[1:28:43] doing the talking right because my brain
[1:28:46] can't talk thank god it's coming from
[1:28:53] something way down inside hey man that's
[1:28:58] why I love what brother Brown said he
[1:28:59] said you can't love with your soul now
[1:29:03] listen you have to run that through your
[1:29:04] filter because you can't feel your love
[1:29:08] with your soul you natural love with
[1:29:12] your with your with everything else on
[1:29:14] the outside that soul inside of you is
[1:29:17] agape love that's the only true love of
[1:29:21] God that is the theophany a man that is
[1:29:26] the theophany that is pure and descend
[1:29:29] the theophany that is eternal life but
[1:29:32] you cannot love listen when Adam and eat
[1:29:36] when Eve did what she did in the garden
[1:29:39] I think about this
[1:29:39] ladies and gentlemen wake up from it you
[1:29:44] men let's just be honest if my wife laid
[1:29:49] with a beast I'd divorce her
[1:29:53] wouldn't you hello come on now naturally
[1:29:57] speaking filial love would you want her
[1:30:02] back if she laid with the Beast No
[1:30:05] so what took over with Adam what took
[1:30:09] over with Adam it was not filial love it
[1:30:13] was that right there it was a Goffe love
[1:30:16] that love way down inside that God gave
[1:30:19] Adam eternal life and not a godly love
[1:30:23] because what did brother Brett think
[1:30:25] that was a type of who Christ
[1:30:27] I think Christ would be a godly love
[1:30:29] wouldn't you that agape love came forth
[1:30:32] and said I'll take her I'll keep her
[1:30:35] she's mine
[1:30:36] keep part of me God I can't kill her
[1:30:39] I want killer because he's me Jesus
[1:30:43] Christ
[1:30:44] go to the cross yes I don't have to but
[1:30:49] ever got me love I will go to the cross
[1:30:51] and whether they love me or not I'm
[1:30:53] still going to die for he died for the
[1:30:57] whole world didn't he but he knew who
[1:31:00] would and who would but he still crawled
[1:31:02] up on that cross and willingly gave his
[1:31:05] life
[1:31:06] what agape love you'll never understand
[1:31:10] it without the new birth you'll never
[1:31:13] understand the new birth without a godly
[1:31:15] love they go together and this right
[1:31:17] here is not love that you love your life
[1:31:20] life with that's the love of God that
[1:31:24] you got a choice you got a choice now
[1:31:28] I'm telling you people we're getting
[1:31:31] close to something get close to God get
[1:31:35] close to God because we're getting close
[1:31:37] to something and I'm gonna promise you
[1:31:40] if you have eternal life
[1:31:43] you won't fear but if you don't have
[1:31:47] eternal life that other life that we're
[1:31:49] going to talk about next Sunday that
[1:31:50] second life property God tells us let me
[1:31:54] tell you what's that and you can go look
[1:31:55] at you and look it up he said in
[1:31:59] thirsting for life 1957 Oh six-30
[1:32:03] he said there must be two different
[1:32:06] types of life and there is two types of
[1:32:09] life all right paragraph II 13 and 14 if
[1:32:16] you'll read that then we'll talk about
[1:32:18] next Sunday but if you have eternal life
[1:32:21] you're signed sealed delivered if you
[1:32:22] just have regular life you saw what
[1:32:25] happened but thank God we already been
[1:32:29] to hell but you know what we didn't stay
[1:32:33] we didn't stay because Kings he up and
[1:32:36] he grabbed the keys and King T off and
[1:32:38] he took the keys of death and hell and
[1:32:40] kicked the door shut well we got to fear
[1:32:45] oh I might stop breathing
[1:32:49] you got your kernel life in two seconds
[1:32:52] she's gonna be breathing and you'll
[1:32:53] never have to stop breathing so what do
[1:32:56] we do it what are we doing here
[1:32:57] we're here to manifest what God's
[1:33:01] already given you let's stand our feet
[1:33:07] you think you love your wife you think
[1:33:10] you love certain things that's not even
[1:33:12] compared to the love of God but just
[1:33:16] think about till next Sunday to life
[1:33:23] because there's our choice we didn't
[1:33:27] have a choice we wouldn't have a one
[1:33:28] life I'm going to snap that shirt let me
[1:33:33] get this out of the way because we need
[1:33:37] it next Sunday's that alright we okay
