[0:03] I'm sorry, brother.
[0:06] [Music]
[0:08] I
[0:09] [Music]
[0:14] didn't
[0:16] mind. You don't mind?
[0:19] All right, brother. Um, brother Boyd,
[0:21] how about um opening a service with
[0:23] prayer for, please, sir?
[0:26] Bless. for the opportunity to witness a
[0:31] baptism of a young
[0:33] person and we just pray that it humbles
[0:35] us enough that we walk in that light be
[0:37] an example to this and we stand before
[0:40] you and we bless these children with our
[0:44] prayers. Yeah. and our comforting words
[0:47] that time of need that they may have.
[0:49] So, thank you for Zoe and we encourage
[0:52] her to walk in the will of the Lord and
[0:54] thy word and continue to be blessed in
[0:57] her life throughout the rest of her walk
[0:59] in Jesus Christ's name as a witness. I
[1:02] pray and thank you. Amen. That's right,
[1:04] brother. A witness.
[1:06] All right, let's read our
[1:10] scripture. All the neighbors watch
[1:12] through the window.
[1:15] What shall we say then? Shall we
[1:16] continue in sin that grace may abound?
[1:19] God forbid? How shall we that are dead
[1:22] to sin live any longer
[1:24] therein? That's pretty powerful. Know ye
[1:27] not that so many of us as were baptized
[1:29] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[1:32] death. Therefore, we are buried with him
[1:34] by baptism into
[1:37] death. that like as Christ was raised up
[1:40] from the dead by the glory of the
[1:42] father, even so we also should walk in
[1:44] newness of life because we're going to
[1:46] the
[1:48] planting, burial,
[1:51] death. She
[1:55] repented. God's going to kill
[1:57] her, which is not a bad thing when God
[1:59] does that. He raised you back up. But
[2:01] we're going to we're not going to leave
[2:02] her there. We're bringing her back up in
[2:05] newness of life. Something that she had
[2:07] never had done before. And now she's
[2:08] having this done. And it's a testimony
[2:11] to here and the neighbors and everybody
[2:13] else that it's an act of faith that
[2:16] she's going to have that she's going to
[2:17] continue on and continue to
[2:20] walk. For if we have been planted
[2:22] together in the likeness of his death,
[2:24] we shall also be in the likeness of his
[2:26] resurrection. Knowing this that our old
[2:28] man is crucified with him, that the body
[2:31] of sin might be destroyed, that
[2:32] henceforth we should not serve sin. For
[2:35] he that is dead is freed from sin. Now
[2:38] if we be dead with Christ, we believe
[2:40] that we also or shall also live with
[2:43] him. Knowing that Christ being raised
[2:45] from the dead dieth no more. Death hath
[2:48] no more dominion over him. Praise God.
[2:51] Amen. For in that he died, he died unto
[2:54] sin one time. Once at Calvary. Doesn't
[2:57] have to die again. We just got to
[2:59] believe he did.
[3:01] He died for me. He didn't die for you.
[3:03] He died for me. You got to believe he
[3:05] died for
[3:06] you. Last wise reckon you also
[3:09] yourselves to be
[3:10] dead indeed to sin, but alive unto God
[3:13] through Jesus Christ our
[3:17] Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in
[3:20] your mortal body that you should obey it
[3:21] in the lust thereof. Neither yield your
[3:24] members as instruments of
[3:25] unrighteousness unto sin, but yield
[3:27] yourself unto God as those that are
[3:29] alive from the dead, and your members as
[3:33] instruments of
[3:34] righteousness unto God.
[3:38] It's a confession, an outward
[3:40] showing that she stepped into a new part
[3:43] of her life.
[3:46] We want to pray for our
[3:48] sister and we're going
[3:51] to everybody just like the
[3:54] dedication. Everybody's going to live
[3:57] this. Hug her neck. She's wet. So be it.
[4:02] But tell her tell her tell her God bless
[4:04] you. Thank you for that step you just
[4:06] took. Many won't take that step because
[4:09] they got pride. They got all these
[4:10] different things. But she's taking that
[4:13] step to the world to let the world know
[4:17] that she's passed from death into life.
[4:20] I am going with me. I am bound for the
[4:25] promised land.
[4:28] What is our promised land? The baptism
[4:30] of the Holy Ghost. That's what brother
[4:32] Ram said.
[4:33] That's our homeland is to be born again
[4:35] and to start in a watery grave. Well, we
[4:40] don't have to die anymore. He's died for
[4:42] us already. Wow. What a It doesn't
[4:46] matter if we have to physically die.
[4:48] That doesn't mean anything. You pass
[4:49] from death unto life if you have Jesus
[4:51] Christ in your soul. You can't die.
[4:54] There's nothing on this earth can kill
[4:55] you. There's nothing any in another
[4:57] dimension that can kill you. It's what
[4:59] God's done for you.
[5:02] It's our sister Joey Urego has come to
[5:06] give a profession of her faith. We sure
[5:08] appreciate our young sister and what she
[5:10] does for the church and we're just
[5:12] really proud to be able to baptize her
[5:14] and give her
[5:17] Lord. He sees
[5:19] this. Your Lord sees this. The Lord
[5:22] Jesus sees this whole thing. He knew it
[5:25] before the foundation of the world this
[5:26] was going to happen. And we sure are
[5:28] proud of you. We're proud of what you
[5:30] do. proud of the things you stand for,
[5:32] too. You spend a lot of time practicing
[5:34] where a lot of people don't want video
[5:35] games and all that other stuff. Hello,
[5:37] somebody. And you're
[5:39] practicing so you can play in front of
[5:41] the bride and be a part of the bride.
[5:44] And we sure do appreciate that. So, to
[5:46] fulfill the great commission, Jesus told
[5:48] us in Matthew, he said, "Go into all the
[5:51] world, preach the gospel, baptizing all
[5:55] new converts in the name of the Father
[5:57] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
[6:00] Thank God for truth. So now I baptize
[6:03] our sister in the only Christian baptism
[6:06] there is in the name of the Lord Jesus
[6:10] Christ.
[6:13] [Applause]
[6:26] Proud of her.
[6:28] Pray for her. to draw. What did you
[6:29] think? Pray for them. The devil's on all
[6:32] of our young kids trying
[6:36] But I believe if we'll just keep them in
[6:38] the word of the Lord. Yes. And she made
[6:40] this profession. Glad to have her cous
[6:44] with us today. Good to have you with us,
[6:46] sister. You're Deanna's kid. Are
[6:49] you Deanna? Yeah, Diana's job. That's

[7:06] Come on, man. I knew it. Come on.
[7:09] [Applause]
[7:15] Come on, bud.
[7:18] Our brother's been coming to church a
[7:19] few times and kind of got a little bit
[7:21] regular. So, and he's a friend of
[7:24] Levis's. And you might Are you with him
[7:26] today? Yeah. Oh, well, you're going to
[7:28] get his little car wet. That's the one.
[7:30] Praise the Lord. Oh, I know. I told
[7:32] myself. Oh, you never Okay. All right.
[7:35] Now, brother, he's made a confession.
[7:38] And I pretty much knew this was going to
[7:40] happen. So, uh, God bless you, man. We
[7:43] see the Lord working on your life. So,
[7:45] just continue to let him in. All right.
[7:47] If you have questions, we're all here to
[7:49] answer the questions. You got big
[7:50] brother Aaron over there that'll help
[7:51] you and Levi and all too. We We all
[7:54] We're family. Listen, we speak the same
[7:57] language.
[7:58] Amen. We all speak the same language.
[8:01] It's a heavenly language that the world
[8:02] don't understand sometimes. And our
[8:04] brother has come in and heard that
[8:06] language and he don't and he didn't
[8:08] didn't shy away from it. He come back.
[8:10] Amen. So in the profession of his faith
[8:13] according to what Jesus told all his
[8:16] disciples to go into the world, preach
[8:19] the gospel, baptize in the name of the
[8:22] father and of the son and of the holy
[8:24] ghost. I baptize our brother
[8:29] Yeah. in in the
[8:31] name of the Lord. Let you say it. Jesus
[8:34] Christ.
[8:38] [Applause]
[8:44] A lot of you have stood in this same
[8:46] maybe not in this same pool but several
[8:49] different places around the country and
[8:51] and made your uh profession. Now I pray
[8:55] that our brother makes that confession
[8:58] that he's going to continue to walk but
[9:00] walk with God. not
[9:02] walk as the scripture says in the
[9:05] elements of sin but walk in the newness
[9:07] of life because sin goes this way the
[9:11] eternal life goes this way so that's why
[9:13] you need to repent turn around that's
[9:15] why the Bible says repent and be
[9:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[9:20] Christ to fulfill that great commission
[9:23] step up here a little bit don't get on
[9:25] that just step up there you
[9:28] go our brothers made a confession he
[9:30] said asked a couple Sundays ago, he want
[9:32] to be baptized. So, we just do not ever
[9:35] want to uh to not
[9:38] anytime baptize
[9:40] anyone. So, to fulfill the great
[9:42] commission and our brother has made a
[9:44] confession of faith that he wants all of
[9:46] you to see that he's going to be
[9:48] baptized today. So, to fulfill the great
[9:50] commission that Jesus said, I read it
[9:51] just a few minutes ago. He said, "Go
[9:53] teach and baptize in the name of the
[9:56] father and of the son and of the holy
[9:57] ghost." So to fulfill that great
[9:58] commission, we're going to baptize our
[10:01] brother Joseph Mumbo in the name of the
[10:04] Lord Jesus Christ.
[10:10] [Applause]
