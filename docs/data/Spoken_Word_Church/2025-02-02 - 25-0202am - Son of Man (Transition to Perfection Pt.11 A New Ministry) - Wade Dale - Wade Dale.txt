seated we have sister Regina come up and next time we sing that song we're going to go ahead and start marching down the aisles praise the Lord good morning Ola everyone um sometimes when the preaching is going on the word is coming forward I think of a song or a verse or a chorus that goes along with what's being said I've been sitting on these two lines for years y'all years just never the opportunity to say them but once I say them you're going to recognize because we've heard it a thousand times and it goes like this into the sea of forgetfulness you placed all of my sins I'm the one that keeps reminding you over and over again into the sea of forgetfulness you placed all of my sins I'm the one that keeps going back over and over again amen we try to go back fish in that water in that sea of forgetfulness why why you heard me um I think I heard brother brandom say that it's the old songs that will carry us through so this is my one of my favorite choruses from the old and it goes like this shut in with God in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power to run in this race oh I love to be shut in with God Sing It With Me Shut in with God in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power to run in this race oh we love to be shut in with God one more time shut in with God in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power to run in the race oh I love to be with my God thank you praise the Lord to be shut in with God Amen shut in with God Amen not with your uh your iPhone not shut in with that but shut in with God Amen that's what we're talking about you know my wife and I were just listening to something coming over and they were talking about um the the young man that created Facebook and said he created a platform for people to waste their time I said my goodness that's a good way to put it amen when we got so many things to do to be shed away to keep our minds uncluttered you know um that's really what it's about you know to get that wisdom that the Lord wanted us to have and not have our minds full congested full you can't even think right you know my wife she telling me you know just of course you know raising kids and you know how hard that is and you know she said some sometimes you just feel touched out I said I certainly understand you know but that's what the devil wants our mind to be so full full that we can't just get away with God and shut in and ask him for wisdom for these challenging situations these fights that we must go through amen we need all of the Lord amen you ready for the word this morning amen let's stand word of God ever true changing me changing you amen oh holding words long preserved for I walk in this world they

sorry but uh we do have that available if you need that and we sure appreciate them doing that for us so that we can kind of have a have a night out so uh remember brother Lise he's at brother Jee Williams today ministering just keep him in your prayer so let's bow our heads remember June's uh sister she's uh they had to intubate her last night or early this morning and June's down there with her now and U she's waiting for the doctor to come in she's watching in now but she's waiting for the doctor to come in so let's pray a special prayer for Amy number one for her soul then we'll pray that the Lord will heal her body but she needs the Lord in her heart more than anything amen she's not she's just not she's just she's just an unbeliever but she's had a hard life she's had a lot of uh issues and um got diseases that I can't even pronounce and um then she spilled boiling hot water on herself a month or so ago go and just peel to hide off of her legs and her arms so that's all in all this you know the body can only take so much yeah with all those comorbidities but we want to pray that the doctors that will give the doctor Jesus will do the work but he can do it through the doctors down there at there she's a Emery So just remember her remember Sister Jun down there with them too so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day you've give us that we've set aside a Time Lord to speak about you father I pray that you take the control of the service father you do the speaking Lord and Lord I pray that you'd take control of that room down there and I see you Lord

touch her body father and be with the family down there Lord and I pray that you'd touch them the husband John and June down there too Lord I pray that you'd touch them Lord be with the sick to on that are Among Us Lord that are sick and not with us I pray that you'd be with them Father just give us this day our daily bread Lord forgive us of our trespasses be with us today in the further of this service in Jesus name we pray amen we're going to take a little uh detour uh we were talking about a new doctrine but I was studying uh yesterday afternoon and uh a thought came to my mind that as we are um human beings there's a course that we all must take all right now that course that we take takes us through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost because remember three is perfection seven is completion but three is perfection everything God does pretty much he does in threes father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ all that all right is everybody with me on that so there's a requirement though that we must enter into and that's a required Doctrine they don't have it pulled up there yet but they will in a minute it's a required Doctrine it's like going to school if you're going to go to law school you're going to go to Harvard you're not going to go to pedmont college nothing against pedmont I went there but it's not a it's not a school for lawyers all right so you just don't go there if you know if you're going to be an attorney you're going to go to Harvard Yale or somewhere you can afford maybe ug or something like that but your specialization degree is where you're want to go to if you want to have in your mind brother Michael has in his mind he wants to be a a civil engineer well he needs to go take engineer classes right I mean he's got the required courses he needs to take the basic on but then when he gets up to a little more advanced he's got to take a lot of what a lot of math amen a lot of math and understand math and know how to put it on a piece of paper M Michael's going but anyway so we are required in this end time to become perfect Christian Amen in an imperfect body amen and an imperfect world all right but that's a requirement because God told us what he would do and even brother R tells us I I was looking up the word required and brother R says it a lot and we're going to get into a little bit today kind of divert a little bit not take so much time but let's go now to uh and read our scripture in 1 Corinthians 2:9 appreciate brother Manuel back there interpreting we appreciate the the brothers that have come we we prayed many many many times that that God will send us some people for our Hispanic uh speaking brothers and sisters that can understand the word of God when it's being preached and we sure do appreciate them amen 1 Corinthians 2:9 but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither enter into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared now watch God prepared I think about this morning you know God when he developed his plan he's Eternal he has no he has no other thought so this is his thought there's no time element in his thought his thought's eternal but he had to see to make the plan all right is everybody with me he saw that uh brother Ryan would need a certain scripture he had somebody write that 2,000 years ago 3,000 years ago 4,000 years ago Moses each one of you sitting here today you're part of the word of God because what God saw you needed now of course he saw some that turns it away he saw something that wouldn't take it he saw something that would drop out of school all right everybody with me but he saw somebody that's going to put on the cap and gown of unmar grace and favor and wear that to a graduation amen everybody with me you just got to realize and figure out for yourself that it's you cuz God already knows he knows the end from the beginning but he put these things he even put a prophet on the earth that give us a required doctrine that we're supposed to have but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God so it's all right to get in deep water all right for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man which is in him like I said before if brother Michael's going to be a civil engineer he's got to study that and and and you know he may have to work at McDonald's to pay for his degree but once he gets out he's got to go do what the degree says you and I have got to do what the degree tells us for this end time to do and that's to become mure Christians right not babies and mature enough to where God can stand there and not say oh don't say that no he gives us full Authority that's what that's what we're looking at when we're talking about this new ministry brother rhe thir pull and all those things speaking of the word not just taking it in but speaking it all right everybody with me for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of the man which is in him we study all these different things mechanics and all these different things even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so we need to study the word of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god if you're born again today that's you that we might know the things now watch that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God you may be SE the Lord as his Blessing to the reading the word and I want to take it in this aspect if you don't mind today because what's happening is is when we're transitioning to a a new message or we're transitioning from partial to perfect or from from um from being babies to being adults all right there's a transition or a shift Jesus comes out and he he says I give you a new commandment I give you a new way amen now wasn't new that he developed he took it from the Old Testament he just magnified it okay everybody with me so new doesn't mean nothing here there's something there when it is in God cuz remember we're look in Revelation 21 now see here's one of the great Revelations that we got from brother brandom is God's not going to totally annihilate this earth right even though it says a new Heaven and a new Earth all right just like me and you he is not going to annihilate your body if your body is blown to Pieces it will come back together if you're bride I just believe that God knows where every sell listen he knew wherever sell was in the ground from the food your mom and daddy ate to develop you sometimes we we think boy that's impossible well I thought the Bible says With God all things are possible amen so Revelations 21 if we're going to talk about we're looking at this transition to Perfection now that's the word being given to us all right the doctrines being turned back to the faith of the Fathers as we've been speaking but you got to we got to we got to bring it in and live it we've got to we've got to absorb it and become it yes we can just hear it and it just bounce off our head that does us no good but it will go into somebody because John saw a new Heaven and a new Earth now he not only saw he didn't see Brick and Mortar he saw people sister Ruth pointed her finger she said me you ought to say the same thing John saw me and you coming down out of Heaven as a restored bride white no wrinkles and adorned for a husband who is happy to be your husband and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth so if we're going to talk about this new message or this new thing that that people um of course they're combating it online that's fine with me I don't care but a new Heaven and a new Earth so there's got to be something taken from the old listen to me something taken from the old and made new by the word of God yes what's going to turn a new Heaven or the old heaven and old Earth what's going to turn it to a new Heaven and new earth the word of God absolutely and that's what's going to change me and you the word of God now saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away that's where brother R gets the word Anon and which doesn't mean annihilate it just means change form all right same way with me and you when you became a Christian you got the same hand you had when you were a devil right some of y'all weren't but that's okay some of us were God didn't have to take this old flesh and throw it away and then bring you in New flesh he took the flesh you had see I'm telling you folks this is the Great mystery am this is the greatest mystery since the dawn of time is that God is going to perfect a bride sitting in human flesh that is the world looks at you and you're like they're like I don't see anything it's not for the world to see we are a mystery you want to talk about the mystery of God to be finished that's me and you being finished that's you and I being finished that's the word of God being in you and I finishing this thing up because you know what there's no other we're it this is it there's no other but the first heaven and first Earth were passed away in other words what when I saw this when you look at Paul when he says leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection in other words not going to annihilate Heaven you're not going to annihilate Earth uhuh you're just going to change his form you're going to change it Absol amen is everybody with me so he's going to do that's why I love the future home he's he's doing the believer the same way he does the Heaven and Earth but it's from justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost three first Paul second pull third pull everything three 1 2 3 1 2 three everybody with me so we're going to stay with that for a little while all right and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband he saw us completed come on and you're the city so you're going to be the one that's going to settle on this Earth come on subdue it oh yeah we're going to have fun in the Millennium but remember death is still there time is still there the devil is still there okay but not in us no we the bride has come to a place to where she is without spot or wrinkle here on this side all right everybody with me and it's by the word of God and it's by us being restored back you got to start by the faith of the fathers you got to start there all right what we've been harping on we got to start whatever they had in the book of Acts the book of Corinthians Paul James Peter all those great ones they had the faith of the fathers they were the fathers and they had the faith but you and I started as children and now we got to grow up to that faith of the fathers yes now listen we got to have faith we got to have faith to believe they were right amen we got to have faith to believe they were right then when we do that when we believe that they had it and now we have it the same way they had it then brother rown says then now it takes rapturing Faith see it takes a higher Faith to go it's the same Faith it's the same Faith but now it's going to be Perfection faith faith is going to take us and we're going to believe that right now amen death has no hold on you right now you got to start believing you say I don't feel like it nobody act Jesus didn't say how do you feel it he said Do you believe it yes Abraham I'll promise you Abraham went to bed that night after he met mzd and he probably groan and ate on his way down and probably had to straighten his leg he was 9 9 years old when he went to bed he wasn't when he woke back up there was a change that night God changed his atoms in his body didn't take his body and throw it away and bring another one he changed that body and then he reached over and changed Sarah's body and they got up real fast not like they went down well same way with you and I what a glorious time yes this word is changing us it should be changing us every day every week every hour every every time we do every time we read the word of God it should change us into that image that God saw all right everybody with me on that but remember man got involved and that wasn't all just man it was the devil the devil got involved in man and they started believing things that were not in the Bible they started believe in things that was not in the new Old Testament when they went to n they started believing things that wern't even in the Bible at all Trinity all these different things that we talking about so what do they do by their influence they killed the word of God they didn't kill the word of God they killed the effects of the word of God and you and I today it's like brother the Bible say there there there's things that activate in our life that we can close God down or we can open it up absolutely we can absolutely everybody with me we can do that so that's why we have to get things right we have to get things out of the way that's why we have to have a restored Doctrine but a required Doctrine and we'll read that in just a few minutes where brother B tells us that Hallelujah so Jesus comes down off the mountain he says tell this Vision to no man what was the vision that he was talking about we don't talk about that much what was the vision he saw Moses Elijah and Jesus transformed or transfigured on the mountain yes all right brother Brown was talking about that you know they were telling him about his second coming they were revealing it to him and then now where's Moses and Elijah in this whole fix they're going to be over there when we leave but the son of man was standing in the middle of them and when Peter looked up and said let's build three Tabernacles he gets all um excited but when he turns and looks the next time he sees Jesus that's the one he's got to follow he can't we're not to follow Moses and Elijah that Elijah you understand number five we're supposed to number four but not number five but anyway even on that mountain who was left Jesus Christ he was the only one left on the whole Mountain so he says tell this Vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead brother R tells us and we talked about the indictment where that they have killed him they killed him and put him back on the cross now you talk about people and and I'll not read this to save time but remember brother Brown said he said the same spirit that put Jesus on the cross is here today same devil that put Jesus on the cross who put him on the cross the Sinners nope the prostitutes nope the religious people of the world it's what put him on the cross and that's what's happening now that's why there's got to be a restored word back there's that's why there's got to be a as we're going to read here in a minute a special group of people that has prophetic Insight you and I know what's going to happen I don't care what Mr Trump's going to do it doesn't matter we know how this is going to end up there's going to be a beast and an image brother Brown said the Beast was a pop and the image was the United States yes sir give me something else that's why we're going to have to be a military we're going to have to be a power cuz we're going to speak for the pope well praise God you believe it or not but that's we're in a system now that that's what's going to happen amen just be ready cuz we may be you think well we got a religious president that's baloney the last one I think was Abraham Lincoln brother R said and George Washington so we're way up the road this way I'm just telling you what he said some of them may go to heaven I don't know but the corruptness of what's going on see the spirit of this time the requirement of this time is is for them to turn up the heat on the true bride somehow they're not going to pick us out and say well that's brandom people and we're going to we're going to follow Bob they already follow him anyway we're going to follow sorry buddy we're going to follow we're going to follow you know all the we're going to follow they follow us anyway I mean how in the world we were uh brother Joe and I were talking that um on the uh Facebook page people are watching and all over the country you get messages I I want to tell you something I give uh everybody know who brother Wilson Henry is right most of you know who brother Wilson Henry is got a picture if you got an older sister brother John do you have an older sister I have a picture of him dedicating her in in in Atlanta in the church I'll show it to you after service for brother Wilson and I have been conversing and I told him I'd like for him to come preach for us cu the people but so brother Wilson Henry those like brother um Joe was saying how everything comes around full circle starts out there he's out in Arizona he's conversing with us and and asking about each one of you that hadn't seen Mom he asked about her brother Gary that's your brother-in-law but back when and uh so we're all kind of connected but why because he clicked online and he watches us and he may be watching us now but sorry brother Wilson I called your name but he sent me a message one day about a year ago and he said man your hair sure is getting white and I ain't seen Wilson Henry in 20 years I said what do you mean he said oh that he said John D go to your church I saw him sitting leading singing I said why you know all these things he said I watch you he watches the services so so that's how much of an impact we have of all of us connected to somebody that we knew way years and years ago that have come back together and there was another brother in Augusta that sent a message the other day two messages actually and said he really appreciated us being on Facebook live cuz that's why he was watching us and we had known him since he was a kid back in Augusta at brother Glenn Do's church so um but what am I saying I'm saying that we are it this is all come on this is all that God's going to do he's doing it through the bride and he's getting us together he's not separating us the world would love to separate us maybe even they want to separ the religious World wants to separate us but the reason they're W to do it is is because there's an unfamiliar Spirit among them amen your spirit is not familiar with this world it shouldn't be now as I read that SCP amen now we live in the world we do we act listen your body is not perfect your spirit realm to a degree is not perfect working on it but your soul is either perfect or not absolutely one of the two but even as a born again believer your spirit realm is still being impacted by the world that's right that's why we have to have a statute of a perfect man that's why brother Ram said these virtues are required that's where I got this um got this from they they required Doctrine so Jesus tells us that El Li truly shall first come and restore all things do you know when he spoke that word he had you and I on his mind because it was never restored until the end time yes sir come on John the Baptist was dead by then they right cut his head off so Elijah number four is only one that can do that cuz now what's he going to do when he goes over there he's going to go over there and get a group of 144,000 and get them baptized with the Holy Ghost but they're not bride they're going to be restored back to True Israel but they're not bride that's right you and I are the only people that are bride abolutely the world is not bride that's right that's right so we're coming to we're in we're not coming we're in a restoration message absolutely if you're not being restored today you got to catch up you got to well I'll read it to you in a minute brother M says look then I mention it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together now watch bring the two thoughts together you'll see that it won't take just ordinary study I was telling you this the other day when you go to college when I went to college from high school yeah I was straight A I never did make a bee in high school don't ask me about the first year of college cuz I didn't think you had to study I just want to play ball but it's a requirement that you study amen it's a requirement for you to study the subject that you are going to go to graduate in even though it may be four years away 40 years away for some of us 50 years away 30 years away 20 years away there is going to be a graduation day yes sir where we're going to to get the diploma the absolute unmar Grace Ring Of God is going to be placed on our hand and he's going to be happy Amen to do it amen sure he's happy with us now but he's going to be happy to slip that band on your finger yes sir he'll be smiling he'll say finally that's the one I saw before the foundation of the world that's the people I saw before the foundation of the world you and I are recipients of his grace Hallelujah and we're also recipients of his wedding cuz we're the bride there is no other bride you and I are the bride there's not two Brides standing at the altar unless you weird like the people are now but it's usually one male one female all right I like what Trump said say did say the other day he said where's going to be just two genders male and a female well thank God for that but you know how many they going how many people going to listen to that brother John none none of them them because it's a perversion so now watch this book now what this Bible can't be reveal to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight all right now watch it requires the ability to hear from God that's why study to show yourself approved that's right not just come to church and let the pastor do it for you study yourself it doesn't matter if it's 15 minutes just get your mind on God for a little while get it off of everything else and I know it's tough I know it is man I'll promise you it's coming up a year I've been pastor of the church and I sure appreciate your or most of your confidence can't please everybody but um daddy my daddy said if you please everybody you're a hypocrite so that I'm not so um amen anyway so I come here and I I have to think about something to do bring the preachers in it's kind of like almost like being an administrator also being a pastor you got to be administrator because I got to take care of all you I want all you to be comfortable I want all you to be happy I want all of you to have something to do I don't want you just come into church and just sit here and listen to Somebody preach there's things I like to do and there's things that we can do as a church and and you go back and I you know I got three different calendars in the back making schedules of who to bring in to preach and you pray over things you pray over the things that we're going to do like the Valentine's banquet and and we're going to have a July the 4th meeting again we're going to have this again we're going to have that again we're going to brother we're going to brother Andre's July the 18th 19th and 20th so put that on your calendar Thursday Friday uh Friday Saturday and Sunday remember we went most of those went last year pre please make a point to go we'd love to we'd love to uh to have everybody there but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know amen there's a lot of things we know about do we know a lot about God I mean there's a lot of things we know about but do we know enough about God cuz see I think brother Bob read if you'll read that book it's either intervail or why are my people so tossed about that one yeah you you read a quote out that right why are my people so tossed about read that book if you're tossed about go read the book there's your required that's your required study if you're being beat up and knocked around sure we all are but you just got to know how to handle it why are my people so tossed about brother Brown said it's because of what it's because of people not being born again basically about people not being born again that's who gets tossed about but remember when we become Christians we're not be TOS tossed about by every wind of Doctrine that's right right as the Bible says or the slot of man that's right look if Revelation is beyond you I've read this two Sundays in a r or read it third if Revelation is beyond you I can't get it all right that comes out of your mind I can't get this have you made your yourself available to get it have you even studied the scripture we read or studied the book you know you don't have to if you don't want to but don't look at me and say I can't understand it God put somebody here either me brother Bob even brother Michael different one Sunday school class teachers brother Aaron anybody that brother Ryan he put put somebody here to answer your question if hold on minut if you're his child am he cannot teach the devil child anything sorry about that he can't remember famous quote from Brother Dale years ago he said God does not adopt can you finish it the devil's kids he won't they're not his he's not obligated to them but when you get born again he's obligated to see you through absolutely but you got to make yourself available amen amen right that's the way you are that's the way you are ever going to get it a revelation is to come from God it never comes by human natural endowments you can get up here and you can be so eloquent you can speak your words so nice and you can speak so fine and keep half of y'all awake but it's not going to come by it's going to come by what not endowments endowments is something I I I give him some money I'm giving him some money to give it to a school that's an endowment all right but an enduement Jesus said go to the Jerusalem till you be what ued we read that what was that a long time ago endued means go in if you're endued with power from on high it's got to go in so brother R says but by spiritual Endo not endowment you can even memorize the scripture and though that's wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God I like what Dad said one time he said he said you know I don't I don't I can't give you and I maybe not be able to find you know give you the answer he said but I know you give me long enough he said I'll find it in the Bible or I'll find it in the prophet's message there'll be an answer to that question and see because why he searched H he knew where to find it do you know where to find it not me you got to find it for yourself amen search out your own salvation with fear and trembling we may not get anywhere today but I believe believe we need to get this thing settled that we're not tossed about that we're you're listen you're going to have storms you're going to have them you're having them right now but as I said many times before a tragedy defines a Christian it doesn't destroy God can't destroy his own kids but you got to figure out whether you a kid or not if you're not his kid and you got an you become his kid amen because every tragedy look at David come on what a tragedy look at all the different one Moses what a tragedy a murderer look at all the things in the in the Old Testament all those people even Paul Paul had a tragedy he was killing Christians or having them killed right Peter was cutting people's ears off cussing at God yes just to be southern English cousing of God or cursing right but God used every one of them in a powerful way because they got rid of that and yielded theirself to God went to the upper room found out that they were his kids and then they said Dad help me Father help me to understand what's going on it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost huh see there and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ the anointed one that's why my brother R tells us and even Paul Peter tells us get the divine nature of God that is the new birth yes it is a divine nature of God you got to get that before you can grow yes sir amen you got to get in the right School know what right books to read know what to study come on well get the divine nature of God and I'll promise you he will anoint what you're looking at that's way he does me brother Bob different on we know that when we're looking here we somebody I mean we may read that we may read that and be doing this and find another one but something's going to pop out amen amen then you go back over here to the same one you flipped over and you go well I missed that why wasn't your time right God had God had got the cogs in your mind working and then all of a sudden boom he drops down how many times have you read scripture how many times y'all read the Bible brother College probably read it 100 times over and over again but I'll guarantee you he'll come to me and say you know the Bible said that he's read it 100 times amen but it wasn't your time to see it that's why it's an eternal word of God it just keeps unfolding every little thing I just turned to the Book of Esther who would have known who Mori was who would have known the actions of Esther would be the actions of us huj who would know that she had an uncle named Mori which means little man we wouldn't have known it without the spirit of God inside of us that's right to point us to that right because remember in the Book of Esther God's not even mentioned this is just a story God's not even mentioned in the Book of Esther and some of the scholars even question why that's in there and like the book of mccabes or the book of job is not in there because supposedly job wrote his own book but I'm I don't I know if he wrote this one or not but uh but they got all these other books and like brother Brown tells us that they got this book and that book but this book right here amen this is it come on this seals the deal for me I don't need I don't need somebody to bring me a book of the macbes which might be just a good history book but this has no no error no contradiction all right so now we know where the curriculum book is right and we have had a master teacher yes amen you got the Holy Ghost but you got a master teacher slides in there and he teaches his class one day we will realize what God sent me and you we'll realize I think we're trying to now but you we are a special sure enough class of people that God only is going to reveal things to us and not to nobody else in the world that is correct I just believe that we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything in the world we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there so now let's look here real quick Isaiah 28 Whom Shall he teach knowledge to whom shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast Isaiah is telling us it's okay to be a baby there is milk there for you there's breast there there's elhad the breasted one where we can call on God but there's going to be a time where God's going to say don't come here you ask and you'll receive you say to this mountain be moved whatever Mountain You' got in your life say to that mountain say move and but now remember it says don't doubt in your heart cuz what's going to happen is as soon as you say move the devil's going to move it may make it worse but remember tragedy does not destroy a Christian it defines who they are abolutely look at Jesus pretty good tragedy right there hung him on a cross said he was a wine biver said he was uh had Sinners and prostitutes were his friends called him bsy buub what else do you need hung him on a cross but praise God yes that's what they did CU he did it for me and you yes sir so the teaching is that which is taught or doctrine that's what we're talking about Doctrine it's concerning something it's not just preaching A good sermon and telling you what this one said and telling you what that one said or even maybe reading quotes every once in a while but what is it it's something that that that God sorry through me some of the minister brothers are trying to get you to see amen I know like dad's always said he said I know what I'm looking at we just ain't got there yet amen and it take him you think I'm slow I was looking at something the other day on sermon 37 on marriage and divorce well good grief 37 sermons on married and divorce well that's my dad but he broke it down where we understand what's going going on and I appreciate God giving us that and being able to go back and archive those sermons and watch them too so so the act of teaching or instruction in religious Assemblies of Christians to speak in the way of teaching look in distinction from other modes of speaking in public you can't take what you have take what we're preaching today and go over to the next person over here and preach it like I said before when I go and March to preach for the Methodist Church I'm not going to tell them God s a prophet if they ask wise as a serpent harmless as death but what we speak as I was telling y'all before we speak a Heavenly language we speak an language of unknown tongues amen go tell them that they'll look at you like you're crazy if they call Jesus crazy and bails you above what they going to call you if you do the same thing I remember they were astonished at What doctrine what does doctrine do here's my point Doctrine brings power Doctrine brings confidence Doctrine brings Faith especially when we know that God can't lie that's right God's word can't lie it landed in a man that could lie but when it comes to Doctrine I'm not saying a lie any other time I was telling you he was born in sin just like me and you talking about brother Brandon amen but his Doctrine was the truth amen and we'll stand that day and say that ain't nothing but the truth now God can't honor false doctrin everybody with me God cannot honor false Doctrine and will not stand I mean he'll stand it he'll wink at it but come to a Time the Bible says where truth has got to be truth yes nothing else but that what if brother Brandon would have been a false prophet spoke a false false word and had your right said that ain't nothing but the truth brother Brandon now God would not have done what he did to that sister he gave her power through brother brandham gave power to speak eternal life you can believe this or not into those two children hello they got converted didn't they she said the salvation of my two sons and God gave them to her because the doctrine was right and the man presented was right and she agreed with it wow you say Doctrine is not important Doctrine is very important right you have no power without a Doctrine amen listen Adolf Hitler had a Doctrine he sent millions of people to death his own countrymen to death because of a doctrine that he was going to get rid of the white race I mean going to have a white race get rid of the Jews and he was going to take over the world that was his Doctrine and he preached it and they say he was greatly anointed I guess he did cuz he giv the you know I think 12 million people over there in his country gave their life just because of a Doctrine and guess what happened that Doctrine had a little bit of power but that Doctrine did not have the power of God so he ended up committing suicide Romans 16 ver 17 now beseech you Brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned brother Bob covered that this morning and avoid them Ephesians 4:11 how we going to get this required Doctrine he gives some Apostles some prophets some evangelist some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints now are you a saint today do you want to be perfected yes sir here's the the prescribed way of doing it right very simple well I think I can no I don't care what you thought amen right for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we now look so this is going this vehicle I think about this the other day when you read that till we all come into the unity of faith in other words we weren't that's right we were not in the unity of Faith right but under this five-fold ministry it's going to bring us together under that Doctrine yes everybody with me amen it's going to bring us together to knowledge of who the Son of God is it's going to bring us to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children in other words wean off the breast that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine well I wonder if this one's right have you heard what this one said I don't know about this one you heard about what that one said what's this one got to say about about it you better run it through your filter amen whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love who this five-fold ministry that's what this whole thing is about five-fold Ministry bringing us to Perfection speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ now remember God in Revelations 21 he's bringing a new Heaven and a new Earth why because the first Heaven and the first Earth is full of sin that's right the first and first Earth is full of all different things that we don't need anymore that's right same way with me and you yes sir listen you got a new Heavenly language when you got born again yes sir when he came in and possessed your Earth you started listening from things above not from things below abolutely so God changed you he's already changed you you just waiting on that yes moment in the twinkling of an eye cuz listen there's no pill there's no special service there's no new book it's going to change your body it's going to come from what you got inside of you cuz that thing so strong that if the resurrection happened today brother Dale brother Mo brother different ones all the ones that went on that's going to bring them and Quicken and change the body that they laid here what a mighty God we serve not going to do away with it it's going to bring what they have now over there in the sixth Dimension and when they connect back up it's so powerful that whatever they got that's now Eternal come on somebody it's Eternal in that dimmension is going to come and make it their body Eternal and stand on an earth that's not Eternal for a moment 40 or 50 days we're going to walk with them 40 50 days folks and they're going to be and we are too we're going to be changed do you believe that become a Believer if not we have no hope what the Bible say we're of men most miserable unless we know what this Doctrine is amen statue of perfect man now watch these fellas wasn't required what these fellas are now look he's pointing at the Statue of perfect man cuz he drew this chart everybody with me remember he's one God gave him the scripture remember he was squirrel hunting I believe he sat down on a tree with a piece of paper and a pen and he said this is what I drew so that's what he drew he put all that together cuz Peter didn't do that Peter just tell us add this add that add this add that right but brother Brandon put it in with all the church age Messengers correct all the church ages where the holy spirit's supposed to be there where the Capstone of love is and all those ads amen now watch amen these fellas wasn't required what these fellas are this wasn't required what this was in other words if you're not going to be a civil engineer it's not required that you learn to be one amen if you want be just a regular human that's your I don't want to be just a regular human I want to be a human with God inside of me this wasn't required what this was what each Church age had a requirement but it wasn't full requirement and it wasn't a restoration requirement remember it was a Reformation requirement but he brought his church up the same way he brought his church up the same way he's bringing his people right then Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue see come up knowledge Temperance I'm sorry I got too fast I'm sorry about that brother patience godliness brotherly love and brotherly kindness and then the love of God the holy ghost now watch Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now brother BR have you got two baptisms here is one false and one real I'm reading what you said remember that word true Jesus was called the faithful and true witness not that he was ever false but it's like the tuning Fort it's a true if it's a SE tuning Fort when you hit that thing I don't care how long you hit it how much it's still going to ring SE everybody know what I'm talking about I don't know what you call those things what you call those things girls tun in Fork tuning fork but you hit that tuning fork and it's fit SE it's going to always ring SE so the true baptism of the Holy Ghost what away from any hindrance look if you got these working in your life you got a lot less hindrance than you did down here absolutely so that's what he's talking about that Holy Spirit fills in the cracks some of us we just need the cracks filled in or some of y'all just needs the crack I need a lot more than that cracks filled inen we come to a place to we're get we're come to maturity where they just may be a little crack and and God's going to fill that in or the Holy Ghost is going to seal it in amen everybody with me but it's because of the required doctrine that you're sitting under today not just me but I'm talking about the day and hour that you live in he comes in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place he's not talking about a tabernacle he's talking about you abely when a man possesses these kinds of thing I listen sometimes we talk about being possessed I don't mind it when it's a right possession when it's a holy ghost that possesses me not a ghost Hallelujah that don't make you happy when you got the Holy Ghost inside of you that'll make you happy I know we have bad days terrible days sometimes but something is going to light your face up something will it doesn't matter what a phone call a text message come on somebody somebody says we're praying for you I love you I got that heart in it's beating in on my on my uh WhatsApp you know that means something well it does mean something to me anyway hallu but until these virtues here go into you you're still now watch you're still off the real true foundation of faith I'm just reading quote but when these virtues grow in and you added that to that then you are a living Monument you are a living moving Idol why am I against organized religion and that's the way God does the church he beats every Creed every denomination every man-made Dogma until he sees his own life reflecting in you now what is he saying let me interpolate that he beats every false Doctrine amen every denominational idea ever something that you come up with or me amen come on every man made Dogma that comes from man didn't come from God until he sees his own life reflecting in you absolutely if I do not the works of my father believe me not see if what is purpose to the church now listen to this real quick if what is purpose to the church now what do you mean brother Ram it's a requirement it's purpose for us to be here today it's purpose for us to listen to the word of God it's purpose for us to know that God sent us a Malachi 4 absolutely absolutely if what is purposed to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things Temperance things godliness brotherly kindness and all these things now watch that's required of you I underline that required of you no matter what you done no matter how much You' shouted how many churches you've joined how many feathers you've pinned into yourself don't do it wait till genuinely from your heart you can forgive till in your heart you have brotherly kindness no matter if they pull a handful full of beard from one side you can turn the other cheek with sweetness until those virtues no matter what they say to you remembering the Lord if there's anything we're lacking let's do it I say the church today if there anything lacking let's do it let's find out what it is and let's do it if there's anything lacking with us let's get back to that restored let's remember what he required not what we think we ought to have but what he said we've got to have is that all right amen what was that in 1963 this was right before the seals were preached we got to have it that way the way that he said it the way he said it yes not the way we thought it the way he said it then talks about false Doctrine in Timothy Timothy says don't have anything to do with them if they teach any other Doctrine don't give heed to them if it ain't edifying don't worry about it don't don't even talk about it if any man Teach otherwise and consent not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord and to the doctor which is according to God L he's proud not knowing nothing but doting about questions and Stripes of words I told y'all before couple weeks ago brother called me and and they um there's a um people on the internet now they're saying that brother brandham said he hated Cadillacs and never would own one and then now he owned one cuz somebody gave him one or then yeah let that sink in for a minute why are we worried about cars what did the man say he said what God said he actually picked up the mind of God and gave it to me and you I don't care if you don't didn't like potatoes I don't care if he didn't like corn or blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah amen oh watch Charlie Brown every once in a while you hear that teacher going wow w wow w w w w well that's exactly what that is why there's no substance to it I told that brother I said why you even listening to that when I got to the first sentence I'd cut it off first sentence brother Ram said he'd never have a Cadillac now have a Cadillac but somebody gave him one and he and he took it beig whoppy but he's proud not knowing you know what it's lack of teaching it's lack of the new birth and any teaching in this message is why people are leaving right I'm sorry the lack of it you can preach on love and you can be happy and you can you can you know do the do the you know the wave and all that stuff but unless you're taught amen unless you're taught you what you're going to have strifeful words doting questions whereby cometh Envy Strife railing evil surmising perverse disputings of men of corrup up minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw yourself so Paul tells us leaving the principles the doctrine of Christ we covered this the other day but let's just make sure we get it down pack let us go on into Perfection so Paul what we got we've got a foundation we're not going to do away with it just like God this is where I kind of went back read this and talks about look Foundation when God created this Earth he never meant for it to be annihilated that's right but man says see that's another Doctrine you go talk to denominational people they say oh god look he said he's going to destroy it he going to destroy every bit of this oh just to annihilate it we're going to go live in heaven where will that be see they don't even understand that heaven and Earth are going to be made new and we're going to come down from heaven on Earth and live on this Earth that was what restored by three processes right water blood and fire justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost everybody know that justification Moses I'm not Moses Noah justification water baptism justification Justified but sat sin was still there come to sanctification Jesus Christ died on the cross he shed his blood it actually dripped on the Earth but what did it do it only saved his children it didn't save nobody else come on Amen but when you come to the fire of God that's where the separation comes amen only the bride now listen only a bride's going to survive any of that any of it we're caught away we're out of the way when God destroys all that but what's going to happen is he's just going to burn this thing off and we're going to just set right back down on top of it therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine of Christ let us go into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance in other words what's going to happen is when the new Heaven and new earth comes it's not going to be the same they not going to be beer joints and cars and all that no all that's gone passed away done away with just like what it was in the Garden of Eden I I picked up on something I'm not going to have time today but when you go back to the Christ the mystery of God revealed what did Brother R say he said all God was he poured into Christ all Christ was he poured into the church and then he added something take her back to that eden-like condition oh praise God thank God for a prophet that moved us through those things and told us where Christ was the Bible tells us in Matthew Jesus speak speaks and says hey they're going to tell you that Christ is over here don't go over there now why are you not going over there cuz you know where Christ is if you're just a Wandering Soul you don't know where Christ is today come on oh I know it's in the preacher it's in this it's in better be in you abolutely so all these things that we have are foundational things that we need to grow by amen all right so the doctrine has to be a required Doctrine to get us to that all right now look so what's happening now I want you to look look notice now everybody that realize Satan controls all political power of the world he said in Matthew 4 all the kingdoms belong to him that's the reason they fight War kill now remember isn't that strange they were given this sword to kill one another he's talking about the second the seal all my notice when he did that he did not have the ecclesiastical power yet but he started in with a demon of a false teaching right demon of a false teaching Doctrine all right but what did that do if if you accept that you become it yeah I want to accept the truth and become it I want to accept the true doctrine of Christ and become it it not just accept it but become it am so what happened to them they became that false teaching now remember it was a do it was a saying it was a deed we'll get into it in the seals and then it became a Doctrine and then that Doctrine didn't stay there it became incarnate in a pope that's right listen right your life starts with a saying somebody told you about brother Rand somebody told you about Jesus Christ you might have not known nothing you just heard something a saying a deed you started coming to church you started doing trying to do the things huh then when you get born again what it become a Doctrine it become what you live by and then what that word's going to be incarnate in me and you listen the doctrine we have today is what's going to take us out of here amen nothing else there's not a new doctrine from another preacher or a new uh sermon coming or a new it's here it's just getting in it and becoming it he started with a false teaching that teaching became a doctrine that Doctrine became incarnate and a false prophet and then he went just to the right place he never went to Israel he went to Rome n see Rome Satan knows where to go that's why he's coming in this message and doing what he did he's trying to destroy this man message amen he's not worried about them he's got them amen he's worried about where the true teaching is cuz he wants to be the God of this evil age everybody with me where did the first Doctrine come from outside of the Bible you historians you know where it came from from Rome exactly where it started if you want to start an uproar you tell the Baptist that he believes everything the Catholic believes except a few things yeah go ahead you better do it from a distance amen cuz they'll fight you they they know that they know that the Catholic church is the old mother they say that that's right but they don't read the part where she had daughters that agree with the mama come on amen amen notice when they got back when these saints of God tried to hold up that word Rome came right in and accepted dogmas instead now let's just see what she did somewhere were fought teaching and we know what that was right the false teaching was all these different things all the we listed them all and we'll get into them but the doctrine that you and I are required to see is on Christ The Mystery of God reveal brother Brown said the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood so where's the Life of Christ that's in me and you all right is everybody with me so the last sent me and you and then by a three-fold manner we're coming back to restor ation by three-fold manner the words coming back in power amen justification sanctification baptism ghost listen when you get Justified come on you don't know a false doctor from a real one not yet come on you just you think that's good I I I found something I can attach myself to but now remember that demon is still there right all right everybody with me that demon is still there so what's he going to do he's going to try to attach hisself to come on he really ain't let go of you yet right if you're Justified you just get your sins chopped off same demon still there right then you got to move to sanctification yes sir where you start coming to church reading your Bible some of y'all ought to try that and doing trying to do brother Brown said you become a what he become a part of a religious order all right so there's a lot of people can be Sanctified but they're not bride amen they can be foolish virgin they can be given eternal life but they're not bride you're not bride until that unclean Spirit goes out of you and stays out of you yes and you're sealed in with God yes amen that's like listen before we close you take the Earth behold I give you a new Heaven and a new Earth behold today I give you a new Heaven and a new Earth you we're speaking a Heavenly language Heaven has come down to Earth come on somebody we're not trying to go to heaven right trying to get Heaven here and listen Paul tells us that if you're born again you're already living in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you're already living not waiting you're already living in it now things are going to happen in life that's fine that's okay like I said before you know how to work through them the biggest support group you got don't worry about going to a psychiatrist I'm sorry if you go to one that's fine but talk to somebody's born again they'll have a lot more sense than some psychiatrist that ain't born again so they'll give you pills to take or something to watch or something to look at or something to do or Dr Jesus will tell you believe the word believe what I said I said you can do all things do Christ who strengthens you that there's nothing formed is going to bother you even though it raise up that there's nothing going to stop the bride from making it interal nothing Satan can listen he can put he can putuj um let's just say this he could put a atomic bomb under all y'all's houses a real one if you're predestinated seed of God and you ain't supposed to die and you're going to come to the fullness let her repi Tator jip pull the pen I dare you oh brother that's just too strong no that ain't strong enough cuz listen the devil's the one in the pin but God's the one is put you give you a standard that's right absolutely do we believe that do we believe that it doesn't M there is nothing formed on this Earth as I said many times before I said it last Sunday man

Pentagon and say I got your answer to all them atomic bombs and them bunker Busters and you know they can now they can put a they can put a u a missile pretty much anywhere they want to within a few inches you remember what they did over in Iraq when they sent that down through the middle of that of that uh round building and supposedly like on the eighth floor is where the is where the person was the U he did the air defense thing well it went down to the eth floor and it exploded that was in 1991 what do you think they got now oh yeah no weapon formed against us will prosper and don't

she'll be at Guantanamo or over in uh uh leworth Kansas and they'll have her in a place where they think God can't get to her but it don't matter you say oh are we that way we are superhumans the world is looking for superhumans they're making superhuman things all everything Transformers and all that stuff they used to make years ago you're the only people that's going to transform and the twinking little ey you're the only people that's going to have the answer for any bomb that they make any War you know brother George Quinn he Civil War buff he knows more about that than we do but he'd say now if if if this General would have come over on this side he studied that enough they would have come around here and I mean he just was a rist that's right there's one strategist and that's Jesus Christ Hall and he's got a he's got a book that we get to and listen it's not closed anymore it's open so whatever we read it's for all of us yes everything we read is for each and every one of us in this building you love the Lord amen listen he loves you more than anything he loves you more than you love him oh wow yes he does right because he gave his life for you he's not requiring that you give yeah he's requiring you give your natural life but he's not requiring you to die listen Jesus Christ is requiring you to live yes sir that's the required doctrine that we're to see today is a living breathing word of God that's what he's looking for he's not looking for your success which is okay he's not looking for your I got this great family or I got this great job or I got this new this you that he's looking for you to yield to him you know how much that cost zero we want to gather up enough money and Dave Ramy says gather enough money and we can to buy this wow no gather this Hallelujah gather yourself behind this and I'll promise you no weapon will bother you let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord thank you Lord that you've give us the requirement and then now you put us in the right place that we can receive that requirement and we can live by it it's a doctrine that fills every fiber of our being and one day Lord that's going to be totally it will encapsulate each and every one of us from head to toe and we'll become into that image that you saw even before the foundation of the world you saw all your children took a picture as the prophet said and put it in your album of that great great time when we were 18 to 20 years old and Lord now we look at each other and we're getting older and are getting gray-headed and different things but Lord that didn't change your mind one bit your mind is still set on having a group of people that's going to be your bride and also your children and we're going to show just for a moment here on Earth in this sin cursed happy gol lucky come what may neilly Willy Earth just for a moment you're going to show your power but Lord we got to get in the right Doctrine we got to make sure we know that we know that we know that we're not drinking milk that we're eating meat and Lord that we're living our sus our sustaining life is you lord it's Revelation from you father and I pray as we continue on and we do start this where brother B talks about a new ministry that we'll see Lord that there's a newness of life that we're to walk into father and Lord just Cast Away the old thoughts and the old old ideas Lord and we may become new in you father Grant it Lord be with the ones that are not here Lord be with the ones that are sick father bless the ones that are downtrodden Lord that are having problems I know that still even you can preach up here for hours and hours and we're still going to have problems but Lord help us deal with them Lord put something put a scripture put a put a quote put a put a brother or sister in our life Lord to just give us a phone call say I don't know why I've been thinking about you all day and you're sitting there having the biggest battle of your whole life Lord I pray that you'd do that now send Comfort to the ones that need comforting Lord send Victory to the ones that needs Victory send your healing atonement to the ones that need healing amen and father we'll never ever forget to give you all the praise and honor and glory for everything cuz you're our King you're our husband you're our father you're everything there is that we need father Lord may we look to you now even from this day forward and Lord as we take communion Lord let us remember that one day you held that cup up and said this is something new but it's coming from something old father I pray that you'd be with us Lord as we become something new out of something old father bless us now in the further of this service in Jesus name amen let's sing just let's sing only believe just for a moment they get ready for communion only only be all things are possible if you'll only believe only be oh only me all things are only let's sing Jesus is here J th is he Lord you're hearing your word you're hearing your people Lord you're here in the morning when we wake up and you're here even in all the problems we have to go through you're an everpresent help in a time of trouble Lord may we look as you told Jonah to look to the temple Lord we look to you father not a not a building but Lord we look to you father to take Lord our sins and put them in that sea of forgetfulness our sister was singing about Lord and Lord that we'll become Lord more like you father from the front to the back in Jesus name we pray amen you ready to take communion man it's an ordinance that Jesus said listen well hold on a minute it's required yeah it's required and you know what if it's required he's going to make a way for you to be able to be required if that is even a word brother R made some up so I'm goingon to make some up but the communion message is telling us what there's something new coming out of something old CU brother listen Jesus was in the Old Testament the New Testament didn't happen until the death of the testator so he was prophesying there's something new coming that may just have been a few days but but he they had to wait when he resurrected another 40 or 50 days and then there was 11 days to Pentecost so there was a good bit of time he was prophesying there's something new coming amen but it's going to come out of the Old Testament it can't come any different Paul proved that by writing half of the of the or over half of the New Testament just using the Old Testament Scrolls now I'd love to been sitting there brother Bob with him and looking over his shoulder and him rolling them Scrolls back come on and he's sitting there reading it as a Jew and he's reading it and he stops and he starts writing he keeps reading he keeps reading about Isaiah and Jeremiah and all one he stops and starts writing what God put something in his mind God saying this is what I meant right here and when these people get the Holy Ghost this is what they're going to see they're going to see you writing this and them reading it and then we're going to see the god of the Old Testament and the New Testament remember brother R said he thought the Old Testament Jesus hated him or God hated him and then Jesus loved him and he said I found out the same person he was just reading through different eyes so let's all read through different eyes for I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body body which is broken for you look this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had up saying this Testament is the New Testament in his blood not the blood of the ghats that's right he identified it in my blood and I'm sure they were going they still didn't know what was going on CU they were I mean they were Jews goat sacrifices and animals and all that and he's saying this is something new in my blood but now I'm telling you on the day of Pentecost that quickened in their heart amen that right there quickened in their heart this is what Jesus was talking about right here that this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood love of the Lord but let a man examine himself there is a way to get right let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many fall asleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world praise God God we will not stand the Judgment of this world if you're born again it's passed away it's passed you passed from Death un life amen wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another if any in hunger let him meat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come what a great it's just an honor that Paul wrote this in Corinthians wasn't even there so it was wrote by the holy spirit so it's exactly the way God wanted us to hear it in the end time amen or even down Through the Ages that's the way he want us to hear not Peter's version not John's version a prophets yes hearing from the mind of God picking up the mind of God Amen I wasn't there but this is what happened praise God for Revelation see there's prophetic people reading a prophetic message and that's me you we get the between the lines Bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father Lord this has been made Lord the way it's supposed to be with holy hands father Lord with nothing added father just something that that we have to put to cook father just like you did there at that night and I pray Lord that you would touch each one of us Lord and bless each one as we partake in Jesus name amen and Paul the way he instructed all that it was for a group of of people that they didn't know any better Corinthians they just ate and drank all the time right so he was catching them or not catching them but he was saying well they're we're having the Lord's supper tonight well they go and they'll eat fish and uh probably some lamb and some potatoes and all and and then they would drink right and Paul said wait a minute this is not the Lord's Supper this is your supper the Lord's Supper is to be taken with sorrow but happiness there's a man did this for us and he said do this till I come I I you know I just don't I don't understand how a Christian can get by without taking communion I just don't see how that's can happen I don't because it's an ordinance it's something it's a required Doctrine de Heavenly Father Lord thank you for this wine it was made a year ago now father and it's just getting better with age father just like your word father and Lord as we partake of it may we remember you father and remember that night when you lifted that cup this you said this is something new this is something you're not going to understand now but you will understand later and father you gave us that comforter you gave us the one the guide by the Holy Ghost goes to tell us what this is all about father just bless each person as they partake in Jesus name amen you know he he had uh when he got up there to the upper room he knew what was coming he knew at that time what was going to happen but the prophet of God said he had to go to Gethsemane he had to go to the Garden he said that's where he fought it out have you had your Gethsemane yet he told us to Bear a cross but we don't have to hang on it but we have a cross to bear but we don't have to die like he died right we don't have to we're not going to he's been crucified one time oh the world crucified him absolutely and put him to an open shame because of the indictment brother Rand BR is what they're doing is is they're taking the word of God and making it of none effect to the people that happened when Jesus was alive he looked at the denominational world or looked at the the Christians of the world supposedly and he said by your Traditions you've made the word of God of none effect to the people in other words they can't get any healing or salvation or not salvation but they can't get any healing or can't get anything relief because you've just done what same way they did it at um at NAA they added all these other things because what did Jesus say by your Traditions he didn't say by the word he said by your Traditions the traditions of man you've made this doctrine of none effect to the people but now I believe I believe brother boy it's become to be affected it's affecting a group of people and I hope it infects us CU if it infects us it's in us I want it to affect everything we do everything we think about sure listen there's one man standing this pull pit that knows we live a human life more than we live a Christian Life oh don't get don't get don't get all self-righteous on me we have to worry about bills kids car wife husband I was thinking about that this today where Paul said it's better to marry than to burn but if you cannot marry he said it'd be good to do that why because if you marry what' he say he said you got to take care of your wife you got to make her happy you got he always said that about the wife you got to make the wife happy happy wife happy life but you got in other words you do you have these different things you got to to worry about we are human beings we're still here like June she she'd Lov to been here but that's her blood and and I'm sure knowing my wife she done laid hands on her she's already laid hands on Ain't No Doubt so you see we do live a Christian life but we do live a human life and we do make mistakes but what what did Brother around tell us the mark of a true Christian was oh that we don't make no mistakes that's not what he said he said the mark of a true Christian if he falls down he gets back up and continues on that's the mark of a true Christian we're going to fight a lot of battles but the Victory Is Ours through Jesus nobody else is going to do it the Holy Ghost inside of you is going to lead you and guide you into all truth not the Holy Ghost inside of me is going to lead you and guide you into all truth the Holy Ghost inside of you is going to do it as we were talking before I think the B touched on it we're not and you see it and and it it's it comes from a spirit because it's not come from God because when God tells us um to be humble we'd be humble right and then there are times when you have to correct but don't let the devil beat you so much till he beats you down because there's victory in what you just went through everybody with me yes do you hear me that's why I said Christians have Victory not ever defeat oh they're defeated no they just never was a Christian you see people leave like brother Brown was talking about different one talking about people leaving well they never had that toost if you got that toost you listen you going to have problems heartaches trials but look to God he promised us we'd make it and if we fall get back up get back up and go again I yes sir I'd rather have somebody do that he didn't say be perfect remember he sure he said be therefore perfect I understand that are complete but we're still Christian I we're still Christians and we and living in a human body but one day you'll overcome it God will do it through you you will be an overcomer when God changes your body I don't care if we have to go by the grave or if we're standing right here God's going to do it through you amen but let's look to the author and finish of our faith let's look to the god that says I've got a a new testament coming there there's a there's a a a new commandment that's what Jesus said there's not a new word but there's a new word are a new ministry as brother R was talking about so we're going to transform into that with the third pull and all the different things preaching of the the seals and all that but you just pray that God give you Revelation you pray that God would put in somebody's mouth we're just servants come on not not Warlords or or or Lords over you you got one Lord he don't make mistake but he gave a five-fold Ministry to help you along yes and pray that God will put it in somebody's mind to look at on the word of God and put it on print and preach it to you that's my prayer and it doesn't matter who it is if a God sent person it don't matter amen let's take communion thank you Lord the Bible tells us that after suppers ended what' he do say now all y'all wash my feet did he they probably didn't even know what he was doing until he started doing what he was doing supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas to carry it Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper laid aside His Garment took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water in the basin and began to wash feet and to WIP them with a towel where withth he was gted then cometh he to Simon Peter Peter said Lord thus thou wash my feet oh Peter Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter sath unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed NE is not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken the Garment sat down and he said unto them know you what I've done to you asking a question do youall know what I just did you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet look this is Jesus right here everybody with me this is Jesus he washed feet now if you don't what does that do that puts you above him come on if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet now he's up here and we're all down here you ought also to wash one another's feet that's just the way I look at it if God Almighty in human flesh can kneel down and wash Dirty Feet who are we to think we're so clean that we can't wash our brother's feet oh my I I have a joy in washing my brother's feet cuz I honestly we pray a prayer that wherever these feet go whatever they do that you'll be with them Father because you promised us you said I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verely verely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him for if you know these things happy are you if you do them amen let's bow our head just for a second dear heavenly father Lord thank you for the sermon youve you've give us Lord that we all even I've learned a few things Lord there speaking it Lord that I hadn't seen before and father I thank you for that I thank you that you send down a little hands full of purpose like you did Ruth there a little a little gleaning going on Lord and just give us a little bit to sustain us till the next time father I pray that you bless each one be with each one Lord that are that's here and the service is coming up Lord and I pray that you'd sanctify the food Lord as we partake it downstairs after we're finished and you'll nourish it to our bodies father but I pray that you'll nourish the word to our heart Lord and our bodies here father just bless each one take care of us in Jesus name amen God bless you your dismiss sisters go downstairs when we get finished we'll set everything up and we'll just go downstairs and uh have a little pizza be back here at 2:30 for the uh song service 2:30 we just go right
