[0:00] were commenting about how that they were
[0:02] never able to be delivered of alcohol
[0:04] until they found
[0:05] Jesus you know you never know what you
[0:08] don't know what state they're in you
[0:10] know whether they're Justified
[0:11] Sanctified whatever but that one thing
[0:13] you know they the only thing that worked
[0:15] for them was
[0:18] God and that's what happens when God
[0:20] comes in he changes
[0:24] you well I hope you had a a good uh time
[0:27] with your family and uh
[0:31] let me see
[0:38] here we did we had uh yesterday was a
[0:42] little bit depressing our little our
[0:44] little Chihuahua passed and we had to
[0:45] burier so it was a very sad day for
[0:53] us well I don't know what's going on
[0:55] here but we'll try to make
[0:57] do let's uh bow our heads Lord Lord God
[1:00] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[1:02] around your word today Lord and I pray
[1:03] Lord that today will be a special day
[1:05] that you'll bless us Lord with
[1:07] encouragement and and help us along the
[1:09] way Lord I pray God that you'll guide us
[1:11] through these scriptures Lord as we
[1:12] study these things out and help us today
[1:14] we pray in your name
[1:17] amen now we're we're going through the
[1:20] book of Corinthians
[1:23] um that that is a little bit small but
[1:26] uh I don't I apologize yall I don't know
[1:29] what's going on on
[1:39] here we
[1:42] uh well if you can't read it we'll just
[1:45] just
[1:47] listen um so we're going through the
[1:49] book of Corinthians and we and we landed
[1:51] on this this verse that says we have the
[1:53] mind of Christ which is there at the end
[1:55] of the uh of the first chapter and we'll
[1:58] back up a little bit and exam these
[2:00] scriptures a little bit more but when
[2:01] you when you really think about the mind
[2:03] of Christ it's it's uh you think about
[2:05] the
[2:06] um uh you know that the Son of God is is
[2:10] referred to as the word of God and every
[2:12] that God's got all these thoughts and he
[2:14] expresses these thoughts and he frames
[2:16] it up as the word so when you're hearing
[2:19] the word of God it it's actually it it's
[2:22] just like what brother R was talking
[2:23] about there it it's changing you it
[2:25] changes you so that you you the the
[2:28] world starts dropping away and and God
[2:30] deity is actually begin to to be
[2:33] expressed because you hear the word of
[2:36] God and brother Rand I'm going to
[2:38] explain as I read all these quotes that
[2:41] what happens as you begin to hear the
[2:42] word of God it begins to frame up your
[2:44] your uh not your head thinking but your
[2:46] heart thinking to where you start you
[2:48] start looking at things differently and
[2:52] uh you you think that that's that's
[2:54] really profound how that uh you know a
[2:57] Christian just can't hardly get along
[2:59] with you know a non-Christian or
[3:02] something because you think different
[3:04] and the word actually starts making you
[3:06] think about things instead of looking so
[3:08] much of the present you're thinking
[3:09] about the future and and looking at
[3:11] things to be against one another you're
[3:13] looking to be for something and it
[3:15] starts everything starts shaping shaping
[3:18] up your your world view and and and and
[3:21] I've got this picture of the Fig Tree
[3:24] and that's really that's really the
[3:25] culmination of change shaping your mind
[3:27] up so that you can believe that whatever
[3:30] God promised no matter what the
[3:32] circumstances are his promises are true
[3:36] and you're going to believe that
[3:38] regardless to be able to speak like
[3:40] Jesus did to the Fig Tree and speak to
[3:42] the mountain and speak because you
[3:44] believe that it is God's word is true
[3:48] and and you don't care if what the
[3:49] doctor's report is and you don't care
[3:52] like Abraham Abraham didn't care how
[3:53] many years had passed as his as his uh
[3:57] body began to get more and more frail it
[4:00] it didn't matter because the word of God
[4:02] mattered more because of the way he was
[4:04] thinking about it than the circumstances
[4:07] so that's really getting it to the mind
[4:09] of Christ so if we go back in 1
[4:11] Corinthians to verses 11 to 16 and just
[4:14] kind of read that again to set a
[4:16] background for what what man knoweth the
[4:18] things of a man save the spirit of man
[4:19] which is in him even so the things of
[4:22] God knoweth no man but the spirit of God
[4:25] now we have received not the spirit of
[4:28] the world but the spirit which which is
[4:29] of god that we might know the things
[4:31] that are freely given to us of God and
[4:35] he's he's talking about we're we're not
[4:37] we're not just it's not just head
[4:39] knowledge but we're connected to the
[4:41] Divine because we've heard the word of
[4:43] God and it's it's actually shaping us so
[4:45] that we now can think like God and we
[4:48] can now tap into his spirit so because
[4:52] he's giving us he's giving us his
[4:53] Supernatural knowledge because we've got
[4:55] his his life living in us which things
[4:58] also we speak not in The Words which
[5:00] man's Wisdom teacheth not not a lot of
[5:03] Education not in lectures but which the
[5:06] Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
[5:09] things with spiritual but the natural
[5:11] man receiveth not the things of the
[5:13] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[5:15] unto him neither can he know them
[5:17] because they are spiritually discerned
[5:19] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[5:22] things yet he himself is Judge of no is
[5:25] judged of no man that's speaking of your
[5:27] perspective if you've got the Holy Ghost
[5:29] you looking at things different somebody
[5:31] that doesn't have the Holy Ghost is
[5:32] looking at you and wondering what's
[5:33] going on with you he he that is
[5:35] spiritual judgeth all things he can
[5:37] discern right and wrong he can he's
[5:39] looking at things from a totally
[5:41] different perspective than the carnal
[5:43] man and the carnal man is looking at him
[5:45] and he can't he doesn't know how to
[5:46] judge the person that's filled with the
[5:48] Holy Ghost to him it's just a peculiar
[5:50] Oddball person for who hath known the
[5:53] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[5:55] him but we have the mind of Christ
[6:00] now brother Brandon would say and the
[6:01] word became flesh he said every word in
[6:03] the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed
[6:05] form that if received into the human
[6:08] being and spoke by the same thought that
[6:10] materialized the Bible brings the thing
[6:13] to pass see what I mean how powerful
[6:17] could the church be now now that's where
[6:20] you know living below your privileges
[6:22] like because we we fail sometimes to
[6:24] grasp that the word of God is so true
[6:26] and so real that if we will believe it
[6:28] it will open up a CH channel to deity
[6:30] and and it will actually manifest in
[6:33] your life it will change your life it'll
[6:35] change your family it it will do
[6:37] something the Bible said let this mind
[6:40] that was in Christ be in you as a man
[6:43] thinketh in his heart so is he and
[6:46] that's where brother R would say is see
[6:48] your your thinking is your character
[6:50] because the way that you think about
[6:51] things will manifest in the way that you
[6:53] treat others and the way that you act
[6:55] and the way that you behave because the
[6:57] way that you're thinking in your heart
[6:59] that's what you
[7:01] are now your thoughts if they become
[7:04] expression like God said let there be a
[7:06] world before it could be a word it had
[7:08] to be a thought so God and the creation
[7:10] created the world by his thought first
[7:12] then spoke it and the thought expressed
[7:14] became material see what I
[7:16] mean now if that same spirit that said
[7:19] let there be light and there was light
[7:21] that said let there be trees and there
[7:23] was trees and if that same mind that was
[7:26] in Christ be in you how much could it
[7:31] say let there be no cancer and it will
[7:34] be gone let the blind eyes be open and
[7:38] it would be so see it's your thought
[7:42] Jesus said verily you said that was
[7:44] Jesus but wait a minute he said have
[7:47] faith in God for verily verily I say
[7:51] unto you if you shall say to this
[7:52] mountain be moved plucked up and cast
[7:54] into the sea and don't doubt in your
[7:57] heart but believe that what you say will
[7:59] will come to pass you'll have whatever
[8:01] things thou sayest now that seems like a
[8:05] a phrase that stumbles us a little bit
[8:07] really anything that I say you mean I
[8:10] can have peace in my home you mean I I
[8:13] can uh those those things that that are
[8:16] those uh that depression or that anxiety
[8:19] or those those pills that I have to keep
[8:20] taking to to to help with whatever
[8:22] problem I've got that I can be delivered
[8:24] of that whatever you'll have whatever
[8:27] things thou sayest now then we start
[8:30] framing up in our mind well I got to
[8:31] prove I got to I got to work real hard I
[8:33] strain real hard but it doesn't come
[8:35] like that it's just the word like a
[8:37] sheep eating grass you just keep eating
[8:39] and eating and eating and the Sheep
[8:41] ain't got to prove nothing it just is
[8:43] what it is so the more you eat the more
[8:46] your thinking will begin to change not
[8:48] your head thinking but your heart
[8:49] thinking where you begin to believe
[8:51] because you've been digesting on the
[8:53] word of God you've been ruminating on
[8:55] the word of God and not on that filth of
[8:57] the world that will make you think that
[8:59] way which is what brother Brandon was
[9:02] framing up in that sermon from last
[9:03] Sunday Christianity versus idolatry you
[9:05] think about the world and you're going
[9:07] to start thinking your your character
[9:10] will Express the world but you think and
[9:12] meditate upon the word of God and you
[9:14] will begin to express the
[9:16] characteristics of the word of
[9:19] God is that right you shall have it not
[9:22] me you shall have it what power has been
[9:26] given to the church
[9:31] and brother I just put together just a
[9:32] list of these things that brother random
[9:34] said that about about this topic from
[9:37] from different places and if you want
[9:39] the exact reference I can I'm happy to
[9:41] pull that but I just for to save some
[9:44] space I just kind of scrunched them all
[9:46] together here but he said remember this
[9:49] and never forget it and and you'll
[9:51] notice how many times he said about this
[9:55] we have the mind of Christ he said
[9:56] remember this over and over again like
[9:58] like he's trying to call out to the
[10:00] church this is like it's really
[10:03] important the right mental attitude
[10:06] towards any promise of God will bring it
[10:08] to
[10:08] pass what what's the right mental
[10:10] attitude like like like Jesus coming to
[10:13] Martha there at the grave of Lazarus and
[10:15] she didn't berate him or anything she
[10:17] just said Lord if you'd have been here
[10:20] and and you uh like the little woman
[10:22] there at Jesus's feet washing his feet
[10:24] she didn't care about all the the
[10:26] naysayers and the scoffers but she was
[10:28] there to Humble yourself and wash his
[10:30] feet the right mental attitude is
[10:32] Abraham saying I I don't care how many
[10:35] years have passed the right mental
[10:37] attitude is Moses I don't care if I
[10:39] don't have an army behind me I'm going
[10:41] down and I'm taking over what God has
[10:42] promised the right mental attitude is
[10:45] looking soberly and steadfastly at the
[10:47] word of God and ignoring anything that's
[10:50] contrary and saying if God said it if
[10:52] God promised healing for my body
[10:56] salvation for my children that I'm going
[10:58] to lay hold of that promise and ignore
[11:01] anything contrary to
[11:03] that the right mental attitude towards
[11:05] any promise of God he said I've seen
[11:07] sarcomas cancer healed by the right
[11:10] mental attitude toward go towards God's
[11:12] Divine word if you'll believe it accept
[11:16] it in another place he said if you'll
[11:18] take the right mental attitude towards
[11:20] anything God has promised God's under
[11:22] obligation to see that you get
[11:25] it that's right because he promised it
[11:28] now see that's frame up your attitude
[11:30] instead of saying oh well I guess I'm
[11:33] just going to have to walk away from it
[11:34] you your your thinking is changed to
[11:36] where you're like God promised it so I
[11:39] ain't backing down from this Faith goes
[11:41] out and grabs it and takes it and it'll
[11:43] stay there until you get it and won't
[11:46] give up because you know that if God
[11:48] promised he's under obligation to see
[11:51] that you get it and now listen to this
[11:53] closely any Divine promise of God see
[11:56] there's another place where he said
[11:58] listen listen to this closely any Divine
[12:01] promise of God the right mental attitude
[12:04] towards any Divine promise of God will
[12:07] bring it to pass if you can look at it
[12:09] right and believe it in that way that
[12:11] it's written say God is your word and
[12:14] take the right mental attitude towards
[12:15] that Divine promise it'll bring it to
[12:18] pass because there's no defeat faith
[12:21] cannot be defeated there's no defeat to
[12:26] Faith where's all this coming from
[12:29] in Mark 11 verily I say unto you that
[12:33] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[12:36] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[12:39] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[12:42] but shall believe that those things
[12:43] which he saith shall come to pass he
[12:46] shall have whatsoever he saith therefore
[12:50] I say unto you what things soever you
[12:52] desire When you pray believe that ye
[12:55] receive them and ye shall have them see
[12:59] that's framing up your thinking when you
[13:01] pray that you're not just praying some
[13:04] to like just to do it but you're praying
[13:07] with confidence that what you speak is
[13:11] going to happen and you're not coming
[13:13] begging but you're laying your petition
[13:16] before God and saying I believe that
[13:18] you're going to answer and I believe
[13:20] that you're going to do it and I'm
[13:22] coming in faith and that will have the
[13:24] same result he's saying as as speaking
[13:27] to a mountain speaking to the figure Tre
[13:29] and it
[13:30] will the word will accomplish his
[13:33] purpose in Hebrews 11 Paul said without
[13:36] faith it is a Poss is it's impossible to
[13:38] please him for he that cometh to God
[13:39] must believe that he is and that he is a
[13:42] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[13:44] him so all of these things are speaking
[13:45] of the right mental
[13:47] attitude we have the mind of Christ Our
[13:50] thinking has been changed and brother R
[13:52] will say now you can take me on record
[13:54] as it's on tape I make this statement
[13:56] tonight and remember this there's
[13:58] another place where he's saying remember
[14:01] that if you will take the right mental
[14:02] attitude towards any Divine promise that
[14:04] God has made it'll come to
[14:06] pass if you can take the right mental
[14:09] attitude towards any of God's Divine
[14:11] promises he will bring it to pass and
[14:14] another place he said and may I stop
[14:16] here just a moment to say this and I'll
[14:17] go on record because the recorders are
[14:19] going that any Divine promise in God's
[14:21] word if you take the right mental
[14:23] attitude towards any of God's Divine
[14:25] promises will bring it to pass regard
[14:29] regardless of what it is if God promised
[14:31] it and you show the right mental
[14:33] attitude God will fulfill his promise to
[14:35] you that promise is good to anyone who
[14:38] will look at it in that respect brother
[14:41] Bob it seems like you're belaboring this
[14:42] point yes I'm trying to drill it in
[14:45] drill it in real good that if you
[14:47] believe God he's going to do it right
[14:51] now aren't you aren't you glad we've got
[14:52] a god like that that didn't just uh he's
[14:54] not like a father that doesn't keep his
[14:56] promises or you know a dad beat dad or
[14:58] something but he he's he's a God that
[15:00] will keep what he
[15:03] promised he said now look Martha had
[15:05] read that story no doubt and she knew of
[15:07] God was in Elijah surely he would be in
[15:09] his son her brother was dead but she
[15:11] wanted to see Jesus here she goes she
[15:13] didn't come out to scold him she come
[15:15] out to worship him and she come running
[15:17] out she fell down at his feet and said
[15:19] now watch how she approaches God she
[15:21] fell down at his feet to worship not to
[15:23] scold him CU he didn't come do what she
[15:25] wanted to do she come right she come in
[15:28] the right minut mental attitude that's
[15:30] the way you've got to come you've got to
[15:33] come in to him that way in the right
[15:35] mental attitude now see how can how can
[15:38] I apply that to my own life what what
[15:40] what if what if something happens in my
[15:41] life that that I don't
[15:43] like something
[15:45] unexpected a relative passes away that
[15:48] dog passes away or something you come to
[15:50] God and you say well I don't understand
[15:51] and you start brating him or whatever or
[15:54] or or you maybe you lose your job or
[15:55] something that doesn't happen the way
[15:57] you expect it to well why don't you
[15:59] frame it up right with the right
[16:01] attitude and come to God I don't
[16:03] understand why these things happen but I
[16:04] know that you do all all you work
[16:06] everything for the good of those that
[16:07] love you and so and you begin to look at
[16:10] things differently and you're coming
[16:12] with a different kind of attitude I I I
[16:14] want I want whatever this circumstance
[16:16] is to change me and and regardless of
[16:18] what the circumstance is I know that
[16:20] you're still God and you're able to
[16:22] you're able to back up your word and
[16:23] you're able to to to meet the need that
[16:26] I have so if you've lost your job God
[16:28] God is able ble to frame it up so he'll
[16:29] give you another one a better one it it
[16:32] whatever circumstances in life God is
[16:34] doing it for your good so look at it
[16:36] look at it with the right attitude with
[16:38] faith and belief and he said oh watch
[16:41] she's at the right place before the
[16:43] right person sorrow heart her poor eyes
[16:45] was stre beautiful girl I guess and oh
[16:47] her eyes were stre the bread winner was
[16:49] gone her brother was dead he was buried
[16:51] been dead four days already skin worms
[16:54] in his body said if thou would have been
[16:57] here my brother would not have died
[16:59] but even now I like that even now
[17:01] whatever you ask God God will do it even
[17:04] now Lord he's dead been dead 4 days why
[17:07] he's stinking but even now whatever you
[17:09] ask God God will give it to you that's
[17:14] right our thinkings changed who ha known
[17:18] the mind of the Lord that he may
[17:19] instruct him how can you know uh a a a a
[17:23] God that lives alone in the seventh
[17:25] Dimension that surpasses all our
[17:28] understanding all of our anything that
[17:30] we could hope to understand but but then
[17:32] God gives you his mind and and slowly
[17:35] you begin to understand the Mysteries
[17:37] and things that seem past understanding
[17:39] and and he he he shapes your thinking to
[17:42] look at things
[17:44] different look what brother R said he
[17:47] said when he speaks it's got to be
[17:49] perfect we can't alter God's word we
[17:52] have to alter our thinking to his
[17:53] thinking let the mind of Christ be in
[17:56] you then you'll think like he think
[17:59] things another place he he said so there
[18:02] is genuine Faith but you must come into
[18:05] the real channel of God to have that
[18:07] genuine Faith there's human Faith then
[18:11] there's faith of God and you must have a
[18:14] Godly Faith to believe now then to have
[18:16] Godly Faith you must have the mind of
[18:19] Christ in you then that's how God
[18:22] projects to you Visions Revelations and
[18:26] all these things comes by the mind of
[18:28] Christ Christ being in you you get it
[18:32] let the mind that was in Christ be in
[18:34] you now see when the when the mind of
[18:36] Christ we we're sitting around over the
[18:38] last week just talking about things that
[18:40] are happening around the message when
[18:42] the mind of Christ is in you that's why
[18:44] you have a minister go down the aisle
[18:47] and point at somebody and say I know
[18:49] what's going on in your life and it'll
[18:50] be true a minister on the platform turn
[18:53] and look at somebody playing the organ I
[18:56] know what's happening in your life and
[18:57] speak directly to the situation it's
[19:00] because somebody's getting in the
[19:01] channel where the mind of Christ is
[19:04] actually active in the church it's it's
[19:07] why you can go to somebody in your
[19:08] family and if the Lord is dealing with
[19:10] you like like he would say in the
[19:12] statute of a perfect man those men
[19:13] waited until they got a nudge from God
[19:15] and then they went and did because it's
[19:17] the mind of Christ working in you see
[19:19] then it becomes so you can go and talk
[19:22] and words of encouragement to your
[19:24] family or something because you're led
[19:25] to do that because the mind of Christ is
[19:28] working in you and then it's not just
[19:30] education and lectures and things but
[19:33] it's actually a something Supernatural
[19:35] happening where God is working in the
[19:37] body of
[19:38] Believers now that's genuine Faith to to
[19:42] take God's word and ignore anything
[19:45] contrary he said we have faith in our
[19:47] heart the faith of God in our heart and
[19:49] can see it clear it becomes a faith and
[19:51] then we speak it and it comes into
[19:55] existence the same thing because the
[19:58] mind of Christ is in the
[20:00] man that's what makes healings and so
[20:03] forth oh you you think if you're
[20:05] thinking like God's word says and you
[20:08] speak whatever you speak will actually
[20:12] Express and become
[20:14] reality if you need healing in your body
[20:16] say Lord I believe that you're going to
[20:17] heal me I believe you already
[20:21] have he said you can't have the mind of
[20:23] Christ and the mind of the world at the
[20:25] same time you can't be in your way in
[20:29] God's way at the same time you have to
[20:30] get out of your own way to let God have
[20:32] his way that's the only way you're ever
[20:35] going to do anything you got to get away
[20:37] from your own thoughts your own reasons
[20:41] don't try to reason just
[20:44] believe he said here is the secret the
[20:48] word is in the
[20:49] bride this is that quote we love to
[20:51] quote the word is in the bride and the
[20:53] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[20:57] done with the word
[20:59] and she does it in his name she has thus
[21:02] sayith the Lord then it is
[21:16] deratization coming in you'll be
[21:19] denominational pregnated but if you let
[21:21] the mind of Christ come into you he
[21:24] can't deny his own word because he's God
[21:30] and they say Billy you lost your mind
[21:32] maybe I did but I found the mind of
[21:34] Christ what's he talking about he's
[21:36] talking about the person of Jesus Christ
[21:39] will come and live in you and it because
[21:42] God is there he makes you start being
[21:44] magnetized to the world and and withdraw
[21:47] from the world he changes the way that
[21:50] you're looking at things and this was
[21:52] why Paul in in in chapter 3 he starts he
[21:55] starts hammering again on their baby
[21:58] isness that he did in the first chapter
[22:01] he he gets on that again he says and I
[22:03] Brethren I couldn't speak to you as unto
[22:06] spiritual but as as unto carnal you're
[22:09] you're looking at things the wrong way
[22:12] you you're not looking at things the
[22:13] right way even as unto babes in Christ
[22:16] now now look at how he frames up what a
[22:19] baby
[22:20] is I fed you with milk a not with meat
[22:23] for hither to you were not able to Bear
[22:25] it neither yet now are ye able for ye
[22:28] are get carnal for where is there is
[22:29] among you envying and strifing
[22:32] divisions are you not carnal and walk as
[22:35] men in other words they didn't have
[22:37] their eye on Christ but they were making
[22:39] all these divisions and and and saying
[22:41] who's who's who's better and who's this
[22:44] and that and and why why were they doing
[22:46] that because they were looking at men
[22:50] instead of Christ right while one saith
[22:54] I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos
[22:57] are you not carnal
[22:59] who then is Paul and who is Apollos but
[23:02] ministers by whom you believed even as
[23:04] the lord gave to every
[23:06] man you think you know if you really
[23:08] frame up what a Ministry is it's almost
[23:10] something to uh it's it's something to
[23:12] help but it's almost kind of something
[23:14] to just maybe this is not the right way
[23:17] to say it but to just be
[23:20] discarded you you use the minister you
[23:22] come to church the minister preaches to
[23:24] you but if you put too much emphasis on
[23:26] the minister like there doing then
[23:29] you're going down the wrong way and you
[23:31] know I just just kind of talking maybe
[23:34] this is just an observation but over the
[23:36] years you watch different churches and
[23:38] things start off and and the people in
[23:40] the church they'll start getting like
[23:41] like the mystery that like things begin
[23:43] to unfold to them and they'll they'll
[23:45] immediately think well this is the only
[23:48] place you can go to get it and they'll
[23:50] and and and and and then not realizing
[23:53] that all around the message the same
[23:56] truth is being preached and see see Paul
[23:58] is actually saying this is actually an
[24:00] Evidence of of a little carnal baby
[24:03] church because they're not relying on CH
[24:05] they're not they're not looking at their
[24:06] own Revelation but instead they're
[24:08] looking at at at a man because I I'm I'm
[24:11] going to tell you you know as the
[24:13] Mysteries begin to unfold if this if
[24:15] there's a group that the Seven Seals are
[24:17] being unfolded and you begin to
[24:19] understand the Capstone Mysteries and
[24:21] you come through the breach uh past uh
[24:24] past brotherly kindness until that super
[24:26] anointing is moved moving in your life
[24:29] you you're not looking at a man anymore
[24:31] like that but you're looking at the word
[24:33] and the word is what has captivated your
[24:35] life and see who what what Paul is
[24:37] saying who then is Paul and who is
[24:40] Apollos but ministers by whom you
[24:42] believed even as the lord gave to every
[24:45] man God gives to everybody ministers
[24:47] it's his holy ghost working through the
[24:49] ministers to speak to you but it's the
[24:51] holy ghost that is the main thing that
[24:53] Christ is the main thing not the man
[24:55] behind the pulpit that we want to have
[24:57] pulpit Ministries and special Ministries
[25:00] and things where with that that actually
[25:01] caus division and why does it cause
[25:04] division because you get instead of
[25:05] looking at the word you start looking at
[25:07] well I I believe this person I believe
[25:09] this person and it causes these
[25:11] divisions and and everybody starts
[25:13] labeling one another well this person
[25:15] goes to this church this person is of
[25:17] Paul this person is sephus and it
[25:19] creates these divisions that where if we
[25:21] would in stay do like they did on the
[25:23] day of Pentecost and look with one
[25:24] Accord at the word that's how they got
[25:27] in one Accord look at look it straight
[25:29] at the word of God not at all the
[25:32] different divisions and things why are
[25:34] you belaboring this brother Bob because
[25:36] Paul did we're just going through the
[25:38] scripture so don't get upset at me if I
[25:41] say these things but get upset at Paul
[25:43] so look what he's saying for while one
[25:45] saith I of Paul and another I am of
[25:47] Apollos are you not carnal who then is
[25:50] Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by
[25:52] whom you believed even as the lord gave
[25:55] to every man so if you want to really
[25:57] Digest what what he's saying here as
[25:59] we're about to close the Corinthians
[26:00] were dividing themselves based on
[26:02] allegiance to different leaders treating
[26:04] these ministers as Rivals rather than
[26:06] Servants of the same God so this
[26:09] actually was an attribute of their
[26:11] immature worldly
[26:14] mindset it was God who worked through
[26:16] them to bring the Corinthians to Faith
[26:19] and all credit honor glory belongs to
[26:22] him not the ministers yeah I think that
[26:26] kind of goes along with some of the
[26:27] thoughts that brother William was
[26:29] expressing when he was here you know
[26:30] you'll get you'll get praise but you got
[26:33] to let it roll off cuz it ain't about
[26:35] the minister it's about it's about what
[26:37] God is doing in the people that's
[26:39] actually in that sermon why Christ speak
[26:41] where brother Adam said that Satan is
[26:42] trying was trying to get uh he was
[26:45] trying to to keep the people from from
[26:49] realizing what they had because if the
[26:51] word that Moses believed was could get
[26:53] Out Among the people and then they could
[26:55] realize it's the people it's not the
[26:57] it's not about the minister the minister
[26:59] is just a a vessel that God uses to
[27:03] speak so Paul would continue that
[27:05] thought in verse 6 he said I planted
[27:08] Apollos watered but God gave the
[27:12] increase so then neither is he that
[27:14] planteth
[27:15] anything Nei neither he that WTH but God
[27:20] that giveth the increase what's the one
[27:21] that plants that Paul laid that
[27:23] Foundation like he literally laid the
[27:26] foundation down through the seven
[27:27] churches ages but then if you add if you
[27:30] keep adding on to that more like if you
[27:32] water and keep growing it it it to so
[27:35] that the church and your so that your
[27:37] characteristics can produce your
[27:39] watering but still neither is anything
[27:43] it's the Holy Ghost so you can't make
[27:45] the minister anything now he that
[27:47] planteth and he that WTH are one and
[27:50] every man shall receive his own reward
[27:53] according to his own labor
[27:58] and we'll stop on this for we are
[28:00] laborers together with God ye are God's
[28:03] husbandry husbandry ye are God's
[28:06] Building according to the grace of God
[28:09] which has given unto me as a wise master
[28:11] builder I have laid the foundation and
[28:14] another builth their own but let every
[28:17] man take heed how he builth there upon
[28:20] for other Foundation can no man lay than
[28:23] that is laid which is Jesus Christ it
[28:27] all comes back back to Jesus Christ
[28:30] that's the main thing God bless you
[28:32] Saints
[28:36] [Applause]
