[0:00] time
[0:02] we're studying through the book of
[0:04] Hebrews in the in a little Sunday school
[0:05] class let's just go to the Lord in
[0:07] prayer before we
[0:08] before we dive in oh God we're so
[0:11] grateful to be able to gather together
[0:12] this morning Lord and we pray Lord as we
[0:14] dive into these scriptures and unpack
[0:16] these things Lord that Paul spoke about
[0:17] that you'll open our understanding to
[0:20] them Lord I'm the blessed brother Samuel
[0:22] and brother uh brother Louise Lord as
[0:24] they're preparing Lord God to minister
[0:26] this morning and uh and he'll just help
[0:28] us Lord to come into great expectation
[0:30] that that will receive what we have need
[0:32] of this morning granted Lord in your
[0:35] name amen
[0:38] so uh Hebrews chapter 8 uh Paul's
[0:43] we we got to about verse 13 where Paul's
[0:46] he's speaking of the New Covenant and
[0:49] and uh last time we kind of left off um
[0:53] kind of comparing the Old Testament and
[0:55] the New Testament
[0:57] where you could say um
[0:59] the Old Testament is uh was fulfilled in
[1:01] Jesus Christ there on the cross where he
[1:03] he just kind of like wound everything up
[1:06] in in his act on the cross as he died
[1:08] and gave his life for us on the cross
[1:09] there and then the New Testament
[1:12] he puts his life in us and he actually
[1:14] fulfills fulfills the essence of the law
[1:17] in us and so you you put those two
[1:19] pictures together of the of the of the
[1:22] the bride and the bridegroom together
[1:24] and it's got a picture of love and you
[1:27] know you you think about where the New
[1:29] Covenant is the real what what the whole
[1:31] story is it's a love story of God coming
[1:34] down and and to redeem his bride and and
[1:37] and and she's not she's not uh forced
[1:40] into it at a curse cursed into it we
[1:42] were um we actually went to a wedding on
[1:45] Friday my niece got married we went over
[1:47] to Birmingham and got to see that and
[1:49] got a little good little time with with
[1:52] family and and you know you when you
[1:54] watch a wedding it's the the the whole
[1:57] story of that wedding everything that's
[1:58] taking place is not because it's
[2:00] somebody's the the bridegroom is is
[2:02] forcing her to to obey him or anything
[2:04] like that and you see when you when you
[2:07] you want to get the real picture of what
[2:08] the New Covenant is
[2:10] it's it's a picture of love
[2:12] you're not you're you're not you're not
[2:15] coming to church because you're forced
[2:16] to do it it's because you love God you
[2:18] don't pray because you forced to do it
[2:20] because you love God when you get into a
[2:22] fix where you you want to fast you're
[2:24] not doing it because you're forced to do
[2:26] it because you love God you don't read
[2:28] your Bible because you're forced to do
[2:30] it because it's a love relationship so
[2:32] the whole thing is love
[2:34] we're not we're not we weren't forced to
[2:36] marry Christ but but it's because we
[2:38] love him and we recognize what he did
[2:40] for us on the cross that he died for us
[2:42] and gave his life for us and now that
[2:44] agape love that was in him is now
[2:47] putting us now that's real love love you
[2:50] know the Greek has a lot of different
[2:51] ways to say love they've got
[2:53] filio love and and storge love which is
[2:57] like parental love and Eros which is
[2:59] which is really not even loved but Agape
[3:01] Love Is the Love of God where you love
[3:03] somebody that don't even love you back
[3:05] you love somebody that spits in your
[3:07] face they love that the love that God
[3:09] gives you the power to be able to
[3:11] forgive somebody and to to love
[3:13] unconditionally
[3:14] so you see that that in the new the New
[3:17] Covenant is fulfilled by love that that
[3:20] the love that you have for one for
[3:22] another fulfills the law as what Paul
[3:24] said in Romans chapter 13 oh no man
[3:26] anything but to love one another that's
[3:28] what we owe one another is to love one
[3:30] another for he that loveth another hath
[3:32] fulfilled the law
[3:34] for this Thou shalt not commit adultery
[3:36] Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal
[3:38] Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou
[3:40] shalt not covet and if the beginning of
[3:42] the Commandment it is briefly
[3:43] comprehended in this saying namely Thou
[3:46] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love
[3:48] worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore
[3:51] love is the fulfilling of the law so
[3:53] that you can see that all all the things
[3:55] that the Old Testament spoke about in
[3:57] type can be wrapped up and summed up in
[4:00] in Agape Love in the life of a Believer
[4:02] being fulfilled and in your life walking
[4:05] on your feet being used God using your
[4:08] hands and using your eyes and using your
[4:10] lips to show love to the world it's love
[4:13] when a minister studies all night to
[4:15] bring a message to people it's love when
[4:17] you come to church and and give yourself
[4:19] even when you don't feel good when you
[4:21] have a headache it's love when you when
[4:23] you give to God
[4:26] Galatians chapter 5 says for Brethren
[4:29] you have been called unto Liberty only
[4:30] used not a liberty for an occasion to
[4:32] the flesh but by love serve one another
[4:34] for all the law was fulfilled in one
[4:37] word even in this Thou shalt love thy
[4:39] neighbor as thyself
[4:41] and James chapter 2 said if you if you
[4:43] if you fulfill the Royal law according
[4:45] to the scripture Thou shalt love thy
[4:48] neighbor as thyself ye do well
[4:51] and first John said hereby perceive we
[4:53] the love of God because he laid down his
[4:55] life for us and we ought to lay down our
[4:57] lives for the Brethren but whoso hath
[5:00] this world's good and see if his brother
[5:02] have need and shutteth up his bowels of
[5:04] compassion from him how dwelleth the
[5:06] love of God in him my little children
[5:08] let us not love and word neither in
[5:10] tongue but in deed and Truth what do
[5:13] these scriptures are laying down
[5:14] something for us to understand that when
[5:16] you get the new birth there's a change
[5:17] in your life it's not sufficient just
[5:20] for you to say well I've been educated
[5:21] in the in the message and in the gospel
[5:23] and I understand that Christ died on the
[5:25] cross but when you receive God the way
[5:27] that he wants you to in the new and
[5:29] you've been born again it is going to
[5:31] change your life it'll change your
[5:33] thinking it'll change the way you
[5:35] approach one another it'll change the
[5:36] way that you approach God because now
[5:38] you're not doing it because you're just
[5:40] looking at a rule book
[5:41] but now the love of God is manifested in
[5:44] you
[5:45] first John chapter 5 says whosoever
[5:48] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[5:50] born of God and everyone that loveth him
[5:52] that begat if you love Jesus you're
[5:54] going to love those that are born of him
[5:56] in love with him also that is begotten
[5:58] of him by this we know that we love the
[6:00] children of God when we love God and
[6:02] keep his Commandments oh we gotta we
[6:05] gotta live live live the word
[6:08] for this is the love of God that we keep
[6:10] his Commandments and his Commandments
[6:12] are not Grievous it's not Grievous first
[6:14] to dress right and to do right he's not
[6:16] Grievous for us to
[6:18] to not drink alcohol and to not smoke
[6:20] and things because because something's
[6:23] changed in our heart and the desire for
[6:25] that has changed the conscience of those
[6:27] things has been taken away and so those
[6:29] things are not Grievous first anymore
[6:30] because the life of God is living in us
[6:32] and we're not living by a rule book of
[6:34] things that we go down a list of things
[6:36] that we've got to do but we're living by
[6:38] the a law of love that God is in us and
[6:41] he's living in us to change the way that
[6:44] we do and the way we think and
[6:45] everything about us
[6:47] and the brass serpent brother random
[6:49] said God has a law and that law is love
[6:51] God can't work against himself then if I
[6:53] love God correctly then I'm going to
[6:56] testify the truth about God if I'm in
[6:58] love with him I've got a wife's here in
[7:00] this building God knows how I love her
[7:02] well you know everything good and
[7:03] everything it's going to be for my wife
[7:04] you know that sure just like your
[7:06] husband would be to you well now if we
[7:08] love God then my confidence becomes
[7:11] perfect in him as I love him now he
[7:14] can't break that law of Love see because
[7:17] it's in my heart when you love God and
[7:19] then you know he loves you then you can
[7:21] really come to boldly to the throne of
[7:23] grace when you've got something going on
[7:25] in your life you can come because it's
[7:26] not something where you you feel like
[7:29] you're being beat over the head
[7:30] constantly but that you're in love with
[7:32] Christ
[7:33] a love relationship
[7:35] so so now we see you coming into coming
[7:37] into reality the true definition of what
[7:40] legalism is legalism is when your
[7:42] heart's not in it legalism is when you
[7:44] gotta uh just a list that you're trying
[7:46] to
[7:47] and I I know I did it again this font's
[7:50] too small
[7:53] y'all just bear with me
[7:56] legalism is the conviction
[7:58] just some notes Here legalism legalism
[8:01] is the conviction that law keeping is
[8:03] now after the fall the ground of our
[8:05] acceptance with God that you got to do
[8:07] you got to follow a list you got a list
[8:09] but your your heart's not in it how if
[8:12] somebody would say how can I how can I
[8:14] get to God how can I get God to be for
[8:16] me and not against me now the legalist
[8:19] answer is going to is going to say I got
[8:21] to keep the law I got to perform a list
[8:23] of rules I got to do I got this list of
[8:26] things that I have to achieve
[8:27] but Paul said in Romans chapter 3
[8:29] therefore we conclude that a man is
[8:31] justified by faith without the Deeds of
[8:34] the law
[8:35] legalism legalism is a failure to be uh
[8:39] and this is just an example of something
[8:40] I I found online humbled broken amazed
[8:43] and satisfied by the grace of God in
[8:45] Christ and again you're what is it your
[8:47] heart's not in it and legalism what
[8:49] happens when you're a legalist you start
[8:51] comparing yourself to other people and
[8:52] saying like that Pharisee that Jesus
[8:55] gave the example of in Luke chapter 18
[8:56] that stood there praying and he said I
[8:59] thank you that Lord thank you Lord that
[9:01] I'm not like this this person here that
[9:02] he thought was beneath him and yet that
[9:04] man whose heart was in it saying God I I
[9:07] know I'm wrong I failed you that man had
[9:10] his prayer answered and Jesus said the
[9:13] Pharisees stood and prayed us with
[9:14] himself God I thank thee that I am not
[9:16] as other men are extortioners unjust
[9:19] adulterers or even as Republicans see he
[9:22] was he was living by the rule book he
[9:24] wasn't an extortioner he wasn't unjust
[9:26] he wasn't an adultery he was living by
[9:27] all these rules but yet he was his his
[9:31] heart wasn't in it I fast twice in the
[9:33] week I give tithes of all that I possess
[9:35] and the publicans standing afar off
[9:37] would not lift up so much as his eyes
[9:39] unto heaven but smote upon his breath
[9:42] saying God be merciful to me a sinner I
[9:45] tell you this man went down to his house
[9:46] Justified rather than the other for
[9:48] everyone that exhausted exalted himself
[9:51] shall be abased
[9:52] and he that humbleth himself shall be
[9:55] exhausted so what's what's the
[9:57] difference that old the Old Testament
[9:58] was you look at it as an outward list of
[10:01] things that you're trying to achieve you
[10:03] know even today the Jews over there in
[10:05] Israel they'll hire a gentile to go
[10:07] perform labor for them on Sunday they'll
[10:10] hire when they get in an elevator the
[10:12] elevators that you don't push a button
[10:14] you wait for it to come to your floor
[10:16] because they got it programmed so that
[10:18] you don't even they they're they're so
[10:20] abiding by this list of rules that they
[10:22] don't put they don't they won't push an
[10:24] elevator on the Sabbath
[10:26] because they'll wait for it to get
[10:27] around to their floor
[10:28] none of the buttons work on the Sabbath
[10:31] you see they look at it as an outward
[10:33] list of all these rules that they've got
[10:34] to achieve but you put that list of the
[10:36] law the tables of stone that's why
[10:38] that's why brother random said that
[10:39] those tables of stone that Moses came
[10:42] down from the mountain with all the
[10:43] Seven Seals because you put that into
[10:45] the heart of the believer and now you've
[10:47] got Christ revealed in Simplicity where
[10:49] nothing can be simpler than God
[10:51] revealing himself into the in in in your
[10:54] flesh
[10:55] that's that's the difference between the
[10:57] Old Testament and the New Testament
[10:59] what's the difference legalism is a hard
[11:01] problem so when you you know you
[11:05] where preachers are preaching to get
[11:07] people not to obey a set of rules but
[11:09] we're preaching the gospel to convert
[11:11] your heart to convict your heart to
[11:13] change your heart to for you to realize
[11:15] that there's something lacking in you so
[11:16] that you're not doing it to just to just
[11:18] so that you don't get preached at but
[11:20] because you love God but because you
[11:22] love God we want to come to church
[11:24] because we love God not just because we
[11:26] love the preacher or love love uh it is
[11:30] it's about a relationship with God and
[11:32] Jesus said in John chapter 14 or John he
[11:35] said if you love me keep my Commandments
[11:37] in chapter in Luke chapter 6 and why
[11:40] call you me Lord Lord and do not the
[11:42] things which I say
[11:43] people can call Jesus Lord and but yet
[11:46] their hearts not in it do they do you
[11:48] really love God
[11:49] in second John he said whosoever
[11:51] transgress
[11:52] transgresseth and abideth and not in the
[11:55] doctrine of Christ hath not God he that
[11:58] abideth in the doctrine of Christ he
[12:00] asked both the father and the son
[12:03] in Matthew Chapter 5 he said for I say
[12:05] unto you that accept your righteousness
[12:07] shall exceed the righteousness of the
[12:09] scribes and Pharisees you shall in no
[12:11] case enter the Kingdom of Heaven how's
[12:14] your righteousness going to exceed the
[12:16] righteousness of somebody that keeps the
[12:18] law to the letter so much that you can
[12:20] take a scroll and and they can tell you
[12:22] if they like brother Dale used to give
[12:24] that example stick a pen right through
[12:26] the scroll and they could tell you every
[12:27] letter it poke through how the only way
[12:29] that you can exceed that kind of
[12:30] righteousness is the righteousness of
[12:32] God is applied to you and his life is
[12:35] actually lived out in you
[12:36] in Galatians chapter 5 it says this I
[12:39] say then walk that walk in the spirit
[12:41] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[12:43] the flesh because if you walk in the
[12:44] spirit it's going to take control of
[12:46] your life what's the point I'm trying to
[12:48] make this morning is that when you get
[12:49] born again there's going to be a change
[12:51] in your life you're not going to be the
[12:54] same person that you were you're going
[12:55] to be different
[12:56] in First Peter chapter chapter 1 he says
[12:58] but as he which hath called you is Holy
[13:01] so ye be holy in all manner of
[13:04] conversation there's your scripture
[13:06] against cussing and profanity and things
[13:08] and having a whole not telling dirty
[13:10] jokes because if God's life is in you
[13:13] then your your whole makeup is going to
[13:15] change your speech is going to change
[13:16] you're not going to be telling dirty
[13:18] jokes and cussing and stuff
[13:21] in Romans chapter 12 he says and be be
[13:23] not conformed to this world but be
[13:26] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[13:28] that me he may prove what is that good
[13:31] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[13:33] in Colossians chapter 2 he says as he
[13:35] has therefore received Christ Jesus the
[13:38] Lord so walk ye in him
[13:41] he that hath my Commandments John said
[13:43] and keepeth him for he he it is that
[13:46] loveth me and he that loveth me shall be
[13:49] loved of my father and I will love him
[13:51] and will manifest myself to him how do
[13:53] you know you love God if you love God so
[13:56] much that you're willing to do what he
[13:58] says that is not a grievous thing to you
[14:00] to to do just do what he says because
[14:02] you love God you're not doing it because
[14:04] you've been cracked upside the head by
[14:06] preachers but because Allah you're in a
[14:09] love relationship with Christ in Matthew
[14:11] chapter 23 he said woe unto you scribes
[14:14] and Pharisees Hypocrites for yeast me
[14:16] tired of men Anderson cumin you've done
[14:19] all these things that you think the law
[14:20] requires but is your heart in it and
[14:24] have admitted the weightier matters of
[14:25] the law judgment mercy and Faith these
[14:28] ought ye to have done and not to leave
[14:29] the other undone in first John chapter 5
[14:32] says for this is the love of God that we
[14:34] keep his Commandments and his
[14:36] Commandments are not Grievous
[14:38] so now you've got a story that's
[14:40] unfolding here a wedding story where the
[14:43] old testimony is fulfilled in Christ and
[14:45] then Christ puts that same life in you
[14:47] and brother random gave the example so
[14:49] many times that if you take if you took
[14:51] John Dillinger and put his Spirit into
[14:53] you then you would act like John
[14:56] Dillinger all of a sudden you would be a
[14:57] you'd be a gun shooter you'd know how to
[14:59] shoot and how to behave in a western
[15:01] town you take the spirit of Jesus Christ
[15:03] and put it into a Believer they're going
[15:06] to act like Jesus Christ that's why he
[15:08] said these signs shall follow them that
[15:09] believe they'll cast out devils in my
[15:12] name and and all those other things all
[15:13] these promises because the Life of
[15:16] Christ is in you fulfilling himself
[15:18] fulfilling what the fulfilling what was
[15:20] spoken of in the New Testament to Paul
[15:23] in chapter 9 he says then verily the
[15:25] first Covenant had also ordinances of
[15:27] divine service and a worldly Sanctuary
[15:30] where there was a tabernacle made the
[15:32] first where women was the Candlestick
[15:34] and the table and the showbread which is
[15:36] called the sanctuary
[15:38] and after the second Veil The Tabernacle
[15:40] which is called the holiest of all which
[15:42] had the golden sensor and the Ark of the
[15:44] Covenant overlaid around about with gold
[15:46] wherein was the golden pot that had
[15:48] Manna and Aaron's raw that budded and
[15:50] the tables of the Covenant and over it
[15:53] the cherubims of Glory overshadowing The
[15:55] Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak
[15:57] particularly
[15:59] now when these things were thus ordained
[16:01] the priests went always into the first
[16:03] Tabernacle accomplishing the service of
[16:05] God but into the second when the high
[16:07] priest alone once every year not without
[16:09] blood which he offered for himself and
[16:11] for The Heirs of the people the Holy
[16:13] Ghost is signifying that the way into
[16:15] the holiest of all was not yet made
[16:18] manifest while as the first Tabernacle
[16:20] was yet standing
[16:22] which was a figure for the time then
[16:24] present in which we're offered both
[16:26] gifts and sacrifices that could not make
[16:29] him that did the service perfect as
[16:31] pertaining to the conscience which stood
[16:34] only in meats and drinks and divers
[16:36] Washings and carnal ordinances imposed
[16:40] on them until the time of reformation
[16:42] now what's Paul saying here he's saying
[16:44] all of these things in the Old Testament
[16:46] that we could look at the the the pot of
[16:49] manna in the in the in the ark and all
[16:51] of the things of the the all the
[16:53] architecture of the of the Tabernacle
[16:56] and how everything was constructed to
[16:57] all of it speaking of the Holy Ghost
[16:59] that was was to come all of those are
[17:01] type Old Testament types of what we have
[17:03] access to now in Christ and what does
[17:06] the Holy Ghost do it makes your
[17:08] conscience perfect make sure what's your
[17:11] conscience your conscience is that thing
[17:12] on the inside of you that tells you that
[17:14] you're not wrong you're not right that
[17:17] that con that conscience is that thing
[17:19] that makes you toss and turn in the
[17:20] middle of the night when you begin to
[17:22] worry about where you're going to go
[17:23] when you die
[17:24] you begin to think that you're not right
[17:26] but there's something that the Holy
[17:28] Ghost can make your conscience perfect
[17:30] to where you're not worried anymore the
[17:32] way you know that when you die you're
[17:34] going somewhere that God is going to
[17:36] that you've been saved and that that
[17:39] voice is now speaking where it used to
[17:40] speak condemnation now it speaks
[17:42] confidence to you now I've got this the
[17:45] voice of the
[17:46] um the definition of conscience that I
[17:48] pull off the internet it says an inner
[17:50] feeling or voice viewed as acting as a
[17:53] guide to the rightness or wrongness of
[17:55] one's Behavior
[17:57] and everybody's got that that voice on
[17:59] the inside that tells you if you're
[18:00] right or wrong everybody's got that
[18:02] little void now Disney would twist that
[18:04] around and make it like a little Cricket
[18:06] speaking to you but you've got a voice
[18:09] it's not a cricket it's a gift from God
[18:11] to tell you whether you're right or
[18:13] wrong or not
[18:14] I wrote around and said unto God he said
[18:16] oh you you trying to say oh I'm saved I
[18:19] go to church don't you worry you wait
[18:21] till that death bed comes and you'll
[18:23] know it's different your conscience
[18:25] tells you something inside of you tells
[18:28] you you're wrong
[18:29] see you know if you die you couldn't
[18:32] meet a holy God as we've seen him last
[18:35] night even the Holy Angels have to Veil
[18:37] their face to stand before him how are
[18:39] you going to stand outside the blood of
[18:41] Jesus Christ to fail you now that's what
[18:44] Paul is trying to say here that those
[18:46] were a figure for the time then present
[18:48] in which we're offered both gifts and
[18:49] sacrifices that could not make him that
[18:51] did the service perfect as pertaining to
[18:53] the conscience but now we've got
[18:56] something that can make your conscience
[18:57] perfect that can that can speak back
[19:00] when you read the Bible and identifies
[19:03] you with what you're reading that gives
[19:05] you confidence that God has saved you
[19:07] and Paul would go on to say he said but
[19:09] Christ being coming in high priest of
[19:11] good things to come by greater and more
[19:13] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[19:15] that is to say not of this building
[19:16] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[19:19] but by his own blood he entered into one
[19:22] he entered in once into the holy Place
[19:24] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[19:27] us for us
[19:28] that's where our conference is placed
[19:30] and what he did for us
[19:32] but if the blood of bulls and of goats
[19:34] and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling
[19:36] the unclean sanctifies to the purifying
[19:38] of the flesh how much more shall the
[19:41] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[19:43] spirit offered himself without spot to
[19:45] God Purge your conscience from dead
[19:48] Works to serve the Living God Purge your
[19:52] conscience your thinking Purge your
[19:54] conscience from dead what's dead Works
[19:56] dead works is like where Jesus said that
[19:59] you're you're like why wash tombs that
[20:02] on the inside is Bones you're coming to
[20:04] church and maybe you're paying your
[20:05] tithes and you're doing everything that
[20:07] the the what you think is required of
[20:10] you because you're trying to work
[20:11] something up
[20:12] but your heart's not in it your heart
[20:14] hasn't been changed you don't love love
[20:16] God the way that you would if you're
[20:18] born again without Agape life in you you
[20:20] can see
[20:21] you know in the in the Jews that what
[20:24] they would do is they would make these
[20:25] tombs like this uh you can see here in
[20:28] this picture and they would go and
[20:30] there's dead men's bones down on the
[20:32] inside of it but they would go through
[20:33] the graveyard and they would whitewash
[20:35] it so it was real bright and nice
[20:37] looking on the outside and you can maybe
[20:39] go walk through the graveyard and say
[20:40] well this is this looks really nice but
[20:42] on the inside there's rotting corpses
[20:44] and that's what somebody looks like and
[20:47] spiritually if they're trying to just
[20:48] they're just trying to come to church
[20:50] and act it out like a good Pharisee and
[20:52] say well well I'm I'm doing everything
[20:54] that outwardly it looks like looks like
[20:56] what a Christian would do but inwardly
[20:59] their heart's not in it but the Holy
[21:01] Ghost was sent to purge your conscience
[21:03] from those kind of dead Works dead Works
[21:06] to serve a living a living God a living
[21:08] reality where God is
[21:10] raised you from death to life
[21:13] and and Mark uh Jesus would say he said
[21:16] he answered and said unto them well hath
[21:18] Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites that
[21:20] is as it is written this people honored
[21:23] me with their lips but their heart is
[21:25] far from me how be it in vain do they
[21:27] worship me teaching for doctrines the
[21:29] Commandments of man what's what's Vain
[21:31] about the way they worshiped because
[21:32] their heart wasn't in it
[21:34] for laying aside the Commandment of God
[21:36] you hold the tradition of men as the
[21:38] washing of pots and cups and many other
[21:40] such like things you do and he said unto
[21:42] them full well you reject the
[21:44] Commandment of God that you may keep
[21:46] your tradition
[21:47] another example that Jesus gave he said
[21:50] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[21:51] Hypocrites for you may clean the outside
[21:54] of the cupping of the platter but within
[21:56] they are full of extortion and excess
[21:59] well isn't that kind of a gaggy Thing If
[22:01] you to go grab a dish out of the
[22:03] dishwasher out of the sink that's not
[22:05] quite clean but maybe the outside's
[22:07] clean but on the inside you still got
[22:08] some ketchup and some leftovers in there
[22:10] you wouldn't want to eat out of that and
[22:12] the same thing with a with a with a with
[22:14] a Pharisee or somebody that's faking it
[22:17] somebody's a hypocrite on the outside it
[22:19] looks clean but on the inside if it's
[22:21] full of full of Filth that blind
[22:24] Pharisee cleanse first that is within
[22:26] the cup and platter that the outside of
[22:29] them may be clean also
[22:31] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[22:33] Hypocrites for you alike unto why did
[22:36] sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful
[22:38] outward but are within full of dead
[22:40] men's bones and of all uncleanness
[22:42] so you see you see the the whole pattern
[22:45] of cleaning out the inside first you get
[22:47] the inside clean first and then it's
[22:49] going to start working out you know
[22:51] behind me on this wall here is that
[22:53] pattern you you get Faith that God's
[22:56] faith on the inside and then it's going
[22:57] to start working out because works are
[22:59] going to be expressed from a life that's
[23:02] been changed and what others works that
[23:04] we're talking of what are the works that
[23:05] are expressed what's the change in your
[23:07] life
[23:08] is the virtue of Christ and the
[23:10] knowledge of Christ and the patience of
[23:12] Christ and the tempers of Christ and the
[23:14] godliness of Christ that are working out
[23:17] from your heart being clinged and from
[23:19] your heart being changed
[23:21] and Hebrews chapter 5 brother remember
[23:23] said past from Death under life that's
[23:25] what means it means to be purged purged
[23:28] from dead Works to serve the Living God
[23:32] that you passed from death
[23:34] unto life
[23:36] what do you care what the world thinks
[23:40] what do you care what your neighbor
[23:42] thinks our conscience has died and we're
[23:45] regenerated
[23:47] and Born Again by the spirit of God to
[23:49] serve the true and the Living God there
[23:52] you are
[23:55] your conscience has died
[23:58] to where you only because it's love you
[24:01] love God and you don't care what anybody
[24:03] else thinks
[24:06] so Ephesians chapter 2 says for by grace
[24:08] are you saved through faith and that not
[24:11] of yourselves it is the gifts of God not
[24:14] of works it's not you trying to satisfy
[24:16] a book of rules unless any man should
[24:18] boost boast for we are his workmanship
[24:21] it's Christ that does the work in you
[24:24] it's Christ that does the work of
[24:26] justification and sanctification it's
[24:28] Christ does the work of filling you with
[24:30] the Holy Ghost and Christ that grows you
[24:32] and raises you up through the statue of
[24:34] perfect man we are his workmanship
[24:37] created in Christ Jesus under what unto
[24:40] good works because when you're changed
[24:42] your life your life there's going to be
[24:45] something that others can sometimes that
[24:47] people are going to be able to tell that
[24:48] the light is on in your house in your
[24:50] Tabernacle which God hath before
[24:52] ordained that we should walk in them
[24:57] in James chapter 2 he said yea a man may
[25:00] say thou has faith and I have worked
[25:02] show me thy faith without thy works and
[25:04] I will show thee my faith by my works
[25:07] because you've been purged from dead
[25:08] Works to serve the Living God
[25:11] thou believest that there is one God
[25:13] thou doest well the Devils also believe
[25:15] and tremble but wilt thou know o vain
[25:18] man that faith without works is dead was
[25:20] not Abraham Our Father justified by
[25:22] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[25:24] up on the altar see us now have faith
[25:27] wrought with his works and by works was
[25:29] Faith made perfect
[25:32] what works are we talking about again
[25:34] but that's that's what the statue of a
[25:36] perfect man is it's the works of Christ
[25:39] Living in you to make you a living a
[25:41] living Idol a living Tabernacle
[25:45] so Paul if we keep going through the
[25:47] book of Hebrews in chapter 9 he said and
[25:50] and the musicians can go ahead and come
[25:52] and we'll close on this
[25:53] for this calls he is the mediator of the
[25:56] New Testament what's a mediator someone
[25:58] that stands between two and also someone
[26:01] that says I am going to fulfill these
[26:03] promises he's the mediator of the New
[26:05] Testament that my means of death for the
[26:07] Redemption of the pro of the
[26:09] transgressions that were under the first
[26:10] testament
[26:12] they which are called might receive the
[26:14] promise of Eternal inheritance for where
[26:17] a testimony is there must also of
[26:18] necessity be the death of the testator
[26:20] for a testament is a force after men are
[26:24] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[26:26] all while the testator liveth we'll stop
[26:30] there you've got a will that you have
[26:32] access to a testament every promise in
[26:35] the book is mine God bless you
[26:38] thank you
[26:49] foreign
