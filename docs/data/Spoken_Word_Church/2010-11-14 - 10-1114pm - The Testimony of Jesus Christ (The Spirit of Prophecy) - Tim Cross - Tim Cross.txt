put this to the side invite my wife to come and they would just sing a song before we go into the message I certainly did enjoy the service this morning right amen we certainly appreciate the pull and the reception to the word of God Amen I wouldn't want you to pull on something that wasn't the word but um I tell you one thing you can always tell when you go into a church where the people are hungry for the word of God and uh that's a blessing and we really enjoyed the fellowship this afternoon we appreciate the efforts of U those that put together the food and the drinks and the fellowship we had with you all was just really an encouragement and a blessing to us and we're looking forward to good time in the Lord again tonight so just Worship the Lord with us just for a few moments here for I've been blessed with so many things my God's been good to me I have family and friends who share it all I do but if I lose it all and I am left with nothing if I have the Lord then I know I'm going to make it because he's the only reason I live and don't a Reus he's the only reason I live and oh what a reason there is nothing in this world that's worth living for it only leaves you empty and longing for more he's the only reason I live and oh what a re now you may have tried a lot of things to find real happiness but if you've looked very far then you know it just can't be found until you find the Lord in the power of His holy spirit oh heal be your reason to live and I'll Never Never Let You Down yes he he the only reason I live and oh what a reason he's the only reason I live and know what a reason there is nothing in this world that's worthless living for it all leave you empty anding for More's the only reason I live and allus yes he's the only reason I live and what a reason certainly there no other reason prop God Tau us deep call it to a deep there's a thirst in every created human being every son and daughter of God now fortunate we are to have found that that that satisfaction I'll turn that back on just a moment brother just this worked up here through my good amen we were just recently down in St Augustine Florida and that's where I believe that was where um oh I can't think of it now the Spanish Spanish uh conqueror went to find the Fountain of Youth uh might have been am Maro vispi I'm not sure if it was him or the other not real good with history but when he arrived you know over here in America and saw the Native American Indians they said yeah there's a there's a fountain of youth you know on down keep going keep going you'll find it you'll find it of course all they found was a bunch of mosquitas down there in the swamp land but uh the first city ever founded in the in the North American continent was there in St August we have found the Fountain of Youth we found the Fountain of Eternal youth amen a message to come and translate us right from these corruptible bodies into Incorruptible uh bodies in his glorious image so we thank the Lord for that thank the lord we didn't have to stop uh drinking we just changed the cups we drunk out of didn't have to stop dancing we just changed dance Partners never lost their Joy never lost the the things God uh ordained in us our human character are some of our Tendencies and desires but we learn how to channel them in a direction that brings glory and honor to the Lord amen well stand with me this evening if you will and turn with me in your Bibles uh to Revelations chapter 19 we're going to read a portion of scripture which we also dealt with this morning but we'll go uh in an entirely different direction tonight with it and just uh depending on the Lord to come and guide us tonight give us the words he'd have spoken brother I sound real strong up here I don't know if that's how it sounds out there to you all but um I trust that's coming through okay we want to read tonight from Revelations chapter 19 and we'll read verses 7-10 let's go to the Lord in prayer once more before we read his word Heavenly Father we come before you tonight with Thanksgiving in our hearts with expectation for what you will say in this service this evening father I pray that you'll Quicken our bodies Lord Quicken our minds and our Spirits Lord to what you would have to speak to us tonight may we be attentive may we listen Lord with great anticipation for your voice realizing father a shout has gone forth in this hour a jubilee trumpet has sounded but Lord it takes a special ear to be tuned into that voice that's speaking and be preparing ourselves father for the great Victory Lord that you have ordained for us in this hour so give us ears to hear tonight father and hearts to receive and Grant father that I may as a yielded vessel just completely surrender Lord my body and these faculties Lord as an instrument in your hands for you to speak through as you desire and Grant father God that your perfect will may be accomplished in this service this evening have your perfect willing way in it Lord for the requests that have gone up tonight for the needs that are present within your body and Lord with on the desires of the hearts of the people father may they may their faith anchor Lord until their eyes watch as your glory and power is manifested in the meeting of those need granted father we pray and we ask these blessings humbly in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen Revelations 19 getting at verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God now we realize this was someone who was here instructing John in these things amen I believe it was angel I believe it was a messenger and here in verse 10 the Bible says John writes and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word and you can be seated I want to take for a thought tonight the testimony of Jesus Christ and the spirit of Prophecy and by looking very closely and very carefully at verse 10 and with the realization as we have been taught by the prophet of God in this hour that John the Revelator here St John the Divine was a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ you believe that tonight and so John was so perhaps he was so caught up he was so enthralled he was so uh so blessed and so um enthused in the things that had just been revealed to to him that he found himself with a tendency or with a desire to want to fall at the feet of the man who had introduced these truths to him to worship him now if you if you think about this for a moment and you you realize this in the light of the fact that John was one of Jesus disciples this was not John the Baptist who was beheaded before Jesus was even crucified and resurrected but this is St John the Divine who was one of the elected disciples that Christ had handpicked he had lived with Jesus he had walked with Jesus he had slept he had eaten with him he traveled in his ministry and all these things he had seen the person of Jesus Christ God manifested In the Flesh amen perhaps even with a greater Revelation and a greater realization of who Jesus Christ was than other disciples now I want I want to establish that in our minds and in our hearts this evening John knew who Jesus was John knew who Christ was John amen was with him when he was caught up in a cloud in the Holy mount on the mount Transfiguration there was James Peter and John John was there at the crucifixion John was there at the resurrection John was there at his Ascension back into Glory John was there on the day of Pentecost John was filled with the Holy Ghost but yet here comes a messenger here comes a man here comes a person who's born in sin shapen in iniquity com into the world speaking lies and John sees so much of the characteristics and the attributes and the life of Christ portrayed through this man's life and Ministry that John finds himself Desiring to bow at the feet of this man and worship Him amen now as a type of the Bride I believe we can take from this that there will be this tendency even within elected members of the Bride to want to exalt a man above his position amen above his rightful placing as a messenger but I believe also that uh this messenger and I believe with all of my heart this was the prophet of God the seventh angel messenger I believe he has a true Vindicated messenger and as a redeemed Son of God through which Christ was permitted and Christ was pleased to express himself through so much so he said this is not the voice of William Brown he has y I have yielded his his being I have yielded his vessel unto me God was pleased to dwell in that man and we saw the son of man Ministry there expressed through William Brandon but not to make William brandom an object of worship come on not to make him an idol not to make him an icon not to make him amen some type of heathenistic or Pagan figure by which we would find ourselves worshiping a man amen but it was God expressing the word made flesh in a measure and in a manner to be a sort of first fruits that could be waved before the people as a type as an indication as a symbol that more are out there now waiting to come to the same manifestation amen so that she can become the invisible image of the invisible God In Bright form amen and so this being a true Messenger he would not receive worship he would not permit John to make him an antichrist he said if you baptize in my name you make me an antichrist right he would not permit John to lose his balance in his worship but he said see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren brother R said if you love me call me brother I don't know what all of you believe I don't know what backgrounds you come from but you know there are there are those that try to deify William bream try to make him some form of idol or object of worship brother bam himself came off of the field because of that going on Amen right he said I'm thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren but he said I have something I possess something I have the testimony of Jesus worship God he directed the work worship toward God he channeled the worship toward God he encouraged any worship that might have somehow come in his Direction he pushed that away and said worship God Amen and then he says for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so he showing I have this testimony of Jesus Christ but not only I I'm just your fellow servant I'm just your brother showing he was placing himself on the same level with his peers or with his brothers and sisters within the body of Jesus Christ right it is only such that the timing has come now for Christ to make himself known and revealed and expressed in a many membered body called The Bride of Jesus Christ amen and now brother and sister this body has been formed she's been assembled she has been gathered throughout seven Church ages beginning with the day of Pentecost beginning with the New Testament Church under a Grace Covenant through all of those Messengers and through all of those attacks of Satan upon the word yet Christ has determined I will have a bride I will have a people that are called by my name who I have raised up whom I have selected whom I have charged and empowered to be my living Witnesses upon the Earth god brother B said will not be without a witness God will never leave himself without a witness upon the Earth right hallelujah hallelujah am so the things we see when we look now let's just turn very quickly to Revelations chapter 13 and let's look at another church and another group of people who also have a messenger who also have a person who is a revealer of the word to them but in in in all truth and honesty he's a perverter of the word amen and here in Revelations 13 we begin reading in verse 5 and there was given unto him a mouth that's a voice there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name what did he turn in his he turned his name into titles right right to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle who is the Tabernacle of God in this hour you and I what did he tell Saul on the road to Damascus Saul Saul why persecutest thou me amen Saul had never perhaps even met Jesus Christ in a flesh body but when Saul was persecuting that redeemed Church filled with the Holy Ghost Jesus said that's me that's my many membered body on the face of the Earth and when you talk about them when you persecute them when you try them and all these things in Tribulation that's me that you're doing that too amen how about it friend that's right how about the way brother B said we serve God as we serve one another we love God as we love one another it might be surprising to us someday to find out Amen in so much as you have done into the least of these my little ones you've done it unto me his Tabernacle blasphemed his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven watch this and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations watch verse 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him they are worshiping a man they are worshiping a figure amen they shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world what a contrast here's a a church who's worshiping a man Revelations 13 they're worshiping an antichrist system which has taken formed now in the in in Catholicism and will be headed up in a figurehead called the pope he will be the Antichrist he will come fully incarnated as the bride is being taken from the earth they're worshiping a man and they'll turn right around and call us bramit manf followers and man worshippers what they fail to real iiz is that God has veiled himself in a body of human flesh amen and we're not worshiping amen the son of Charles and El Bram but we're worshiping The God Who was pleased to dwell within that body right with the realization that the same God who had manifested and expressed himself through a carnal born son of Charles and ell Brown the same God desires to accomplish the same purpose through a bride who has received that message Hallelujah that God brought through that Prophet come on am call me a man follower call me a man worshiper I don't care I know by Revelation amen what the church is built on is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's right not Peter but Christ in Peter right amen oh I feel like preaching now amen you can never have a realization the revelation of who you are until you have a revelation of who Christ is when Peter called a revelation that Jesus was not a second person he was the person he was Emmanuel he was Elohim he was je Jehovah of the Old Testament he Jesus of the new and Jesus said and thou are Peter now that you have recognized my spiritual Revelation who who I am now Jesus can begin placing Peter right placing Peter as a stone in the great building right oh praise the lord well God I've got to get into my message let's look at something tonight turn with me to Jeremiah chapter 27 how many knows what Jeremiah Was he was a prophet right everybody know Jeremiah was a prophet of course we don't believe in prophets nowadays do modern day Church world the secular church has a resistance to prophets but God uses prophets amen I'm I'm told by men who study these things that the reason the Jews fail to realize the Messiah is because they had rejected all the prophets no they' slain them all they' killed them all of course they went then why did their suppers at all these things Jesus said you you you worship the prophets but your father others is the ones that put them there right because they refused the prophets they failed to see the Messiah right even Jesus own disciples come down from the Mount of transfiguration said why then do the scribes say that Elias must first come they didn't even know who Elias was right Jesus said Elias shall truly first come to restore all things but I tell you that he's already come and they did with him what they listed if you don't see the ministry of the prophets you'll never see who he came to introduce right if you don't catch the revelation of the Forerunner how are you going to catch the royalty that the Forerunner come to introduce to you and I so thank God if you've got a revelation I heard a brother talking the other day uh said you know I was in the Baptist Church and I was looking for Elijah to come he said I had no idea why but he said I knew God was going to send Elijah so finally some one day somebody told him hey brother Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 Elijah has comeing this hour he went the with a seed of predestination down in his heart for no understandable reason was looking for Elijah why you must receive the ministry of the Forerunner before you can be introduced to the person of Jesus Christ amen it's wonderful Jeremiah chapter 27 beginning at verse one in the beginning of the reign of jeam the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord saying thus sayth the Lord to me make thee bonds and yolks and put them upon thy neck and send them to the king of Edom and to the king of Moab and to the king of the ammonites to the king of Tyrus and to the king of zidon by the hand of The Messengers which come to Jerusalem unto zedekiah king of Judah and command them to say unto their masters thus saith the Lord God of the Lord of hosts the god of Israel thus shall you say unto your Masters verse five I have made the Earth the man and the Beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meat unto me and now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him bet this Mage didn't make Jeremiah too popular God has has given these Kings that's right Their Kingdoms their beasts their cattle their peoples their lands into the hand of a Babylonian King neuch that's right I tell you one thing think about it being a prophet is not always a highly saw after position amen and being a follower of his message is not always a prestigious thing either verse 7 All Nations Shall Serve him and his son and his son's son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great Kings Shall Serve themselves of him it shall come to pass that the nation and Kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchad or the king of Babylon and that will not put their neck under the Yoke of the king of Babylon that Nation will I punish sayeth the Lord with the sword and with the famine and with with the pestilence until I have consumed them by his hand therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your Sorcerers which speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of Babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that I should drive you out and ye should perish but the Nations that bring their neck under the Yoke of the king of babyon and serve him those will I let remain still in their own land sayeth the Lord and they shall till it and dwell therein verse 12 I spake also to zedekiah King of Judah according to all these words saying bring your necks under the Yol of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people and live why will will you die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine by the pestilence as the Lord has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of Babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you for I have not sent them sayeth the Lord yet they prophesy a lie in my name that I might drive you out and that you might perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you also I spake to the priest and to all this people saying thus sayith the Lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the Lord's House shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you hearken not unto them serve the king of Babylon and live wherefore should this city be laid waste but if they be prophets and if the word of the Lord be with them let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord and in the king in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem go not to Babylon for thus saith the Lord of host concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city which Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon took not when he carried away captive Janiah the son of jeho king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon and all the Nobles of Judah and Jerusalem yay thus sayth the Lord of host the god of Israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and Jerusalem they shall be carried to Babylon and there shall they be until the day that I visit them sayith the Lord then will I bring them up and restore them to this place quite a message amen quite a message to Israel but if you will study back into Deuteronomy you'll find out this is exactly what God predicted would happen to them if they did not follow his precepts right his Commandments and his ordained way for them to stay under the Covenant of blessing in the land the promised land he said if you hearken not if you deviate if you go and back to to your Idols back to your Gods I will permit the surrounding countries to take you captive and to come in and to to to wreak all this Havoc upon your land and your Worship in the temple and all these different things so Jeremiah's prophecy is perfectly in line with what Moses told them in the book of Deuteronomy although I'm certain this did not help Jeremiah's ratings amongst the children of Israel amen I'm sure this was not an easy message for him to preach I'm sure this was not an easy message for them to receive and it was very evident by the just the nature of the prophecy that was given that there were other prophets there were other Ministries that were highly esteemed and your prophets your Chatters your divers your Sorcerers all these people had multiple sources of Revelation but there was only one provided way for God to speak to them and he said disregard everything they say that comes contrary to this message amen I believe that's good advice for us today we have a responsibility as Sons and Daughters of God to compare everything that comes across our ears to the prophet's message and we not the ministry we will be held accountable for how we judge that and hold that standard of the message in place amen it is it is incumbent upon us to take what is preached to us and compare it to God's word amen I'm not saying that because I think brother Samuel or brother Wade are getting up here preaching something you understand I think they tell you the same thing take everything that's preached judge it by the Yan Thum judge it by the word of God take every notion take every idea that comes to you whether by inspiration or anointing in prayer whatever it may be Everything Must Go back to the standard which is the word of God okay but now Jeremiah comes and he gives this he gives this Doom and Gloom prophecy and so the Bible comes over here and I'll try to to I know it gets old sometimes or tiome tiresome hearing all the scriptures read but in verse in chapter 28 it continues in verse one it says and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that hananiah the son of Aer the prophet which was of gibian spake unto me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people saying thus sayith the Lord God of hosts the god of Israel saying I have broken the Yoke of the king of Babylon within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord's House that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon took away from this place and Carri them to Babylon and I will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jeho King of Judah with all the captives of Judah that went into Babylon sayith the Lord for I will break the Yoke of the king of Babylon then the Prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet haniah in the presence of the priest and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord even the Prophet Jeremiah said amen amen the Lord do so the Lord perform thy Words which thou has prophesied to bring again the vessels of the Lord's house and all that is carried away captive from Babylon into this place nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against Great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence the prophet which prophesieth of Peace when the word of the Prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the Lord ha truly s him amen now brother we've got ourselves uh raging conflict right here before the church right here before the priests right here before the people Jeremiah has raised up and prophesied captivity prophesied bondage prophesied the vessels being taken out of the temple and hananiah raises up and says hey two years and God's going to break the Yoke verse 10 then hananiah the prophet took the Yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and break it he just broke the thing brother you talking about charismatics these people weren't weren't afraid to get just get act an out right there in the sanctuary you know he just broke it verse 11 and hananias spake in the presence of all the people saying thus sayith the Lord even so will I break the Yoke of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon from the neck of all Nations within the space of two full years and the Prophet Jeremiah went his way notice he never re responded he had nothing to prove he either had the word of the Lord or he kept silent now many would view this as a personal attack of hananiah on Jeremiah but Jeremiah didn't take it personally that's right no true servant of God will ever take it personally it was God who gave him the words to speak he spoke on behalf of God hananiah was obviously speaking on behalf of another power another influence and when he broke that no that yoke off of Jeremiah's neck regardless of how humiliating regardless of how embarrassing regardless of how uh shameful that may have seemed Jeremiah simply walked away then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah the prophet had broken the Yoke from off the neck of the Prophet Jeremiah saying go and tell hananiah saying thus sayeth the Lord thou Hast broken the yolks of wood but Thou shalt make for them yolks of iron for thus saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and they shall serve him and I have given him the Beast of the field also then said the Prophet Jeremiah unto haniah the prophet here now haniah the Lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a li therefore saeth the Lord behold I will cast thee from off the face of the Earth this year Thou shalt die because thou Hast taught Rebellion against the Lord so hananiah the prophet died the same year year in the 17th month now here's what I want to use this illustration to to show to you or to the thought that I want to convey to you this evening Jeremiah was God's Prophet to God's children Israel they could claim him as their messenger and their prophet and the mouthpiece of God or the channel through which God could convey his thoughts his will his plan for the people now Jeremiah's prophecies were one thing but in this example God instructs Jeremiah to go no doubt down to a blacksmith or down to a cobbler down to someone that could take a yoke of wood and place it around Jeremiah's neck and Jeremiah comes to church to preach his message with the Yol a wooden Yol around his neck now imagine if you were sitting here on a Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m. or 10:15 10:30 10:45 and they begin singing Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord and here comes brother Samuel Dell walking in the aisle with a big wooden yolk around this neck oh my you'd be getting on the cell phone calling your friends calling your neighbors calling the mayor oh I'm so proud of my pastor I tell you what he's really got a revelation he's really got the mind of God for this you'd be embarrassed wouldn't you huh you'd say what in the world has gotten into that brother maybe maybe you know he he the doctor prescribed him uh some dementia pills or something he forgot to take you know what I'm saying not to be disrespectful but in your mind how are you going to think if this is your prophet this is your messenger and he's coming and he's behaving himself and he's conducting himself in this manner but you see we can look back now on through time we can look back on this example and realize the life and the ministry of this prophet of God was symbolic amen it was portraying something that was not even necessarily for him it wasn't Jeremiah that had sined it wasn't Jeremiah that had ENT into idolatry it wasn't Jeremiah that was constantly backsliding and falling from Grace but his life and Ministry was portraying something that was coming on the people are you with me and hananiah being a a being a hirling prophet or being persuaded or influenced by the desires of the people he comes under an anointing and and prophesies no no no no no we're not going into bondage we're not going to have to suffer we're not going to have to come under these things that you know are are coming contrary to our desires and our wishes and our plans no it's only going to last two years and he literally goes as far as to break that Yol of wood right off of Jeremiah's neck no doubt he danced around see there that was nothing not just Jeremiah he's you know he's lost it he's cuckoo he's Loco whatever the casee may be I'm the real Prophet send your tithes to me you know uh send your love letters here send your offerings and I you know I'll tell you what you want to hear oh my friend but God had provided way and God had a plan and God was going to execute judgment upon the people so breaking that wooden Yol did nothing but increase the intensity of of the Judgment that God had determined to execute upon those people and he told Jeremiah you go back down and you get a Yol of iron and he won't break that brother he'll get a lot of knee injuries sister Dell's trying to break that yoke amen God portraying through the life of a prophet through the ministry of a prophet something that's coming on the people now just think about that with me for a moment as as unusual as that may have seemed as awkward as as strange as that may have seemed there was a special message that God was trying to convey through the unusual conduct and actions of that Prophet how many remembers a man the Bible by the name of Ezekiel God told him to lay on one side for 390 days then told him lay on the other side 40 days how proud would you have been that's my pastor that's my preacher oh the Holy Roller yeah but you see his life and Ministry was showing something coming on the people how would you like to have had Hosea for your pastor God told him to go a woman of homs right a prostitute as it were a woman of homs why not for anything Hosea had done not to show that it was acceptable or permissible or even advisable for a minister to marry a woman of this ill fame or ill repute but showing that Israel had gone into spiritual idolatry Israel had gone into spiritual homs and the life and Ministry of that Prophet was display playing that or portraying that in front of the world as well as the people are you with me now so what if we take this principle and apply it to the day that you and I live those are negative examples but let's look for a moment at Abraham and Sarah God sent them a prophet one day MDC God in this hour revealed how he accomplished that right brother said he come right down scooped up 16 elements from the earth and a handful of dust blew into that body formed himself a body then Elohim stepped into that body and he went down to the tent of Abraham and S Etc and delivered a message to them I will visit you according to the time of life amen is God able is there anything God can't do Sarah laughing in the tentor oh but if they could have only had a revelation if God can take 16 elements of a sin cursed Earth form himself a body step into it walk down here and deliver this message can God take our body IES and transform them back to young man and young woman again and not only that but then give us the ability to do something that even at that age we were unable to do God showing through the life and Ministry and the conduct of mezc that the promis the time is nigh now the time has arrived for the manifestation of the promised word that's right God said it amen God was building their faith God was conditioning their faith to accept his promised word but now MDC comes on the scene in a body of Flesh and says your faith has reached the level now where you can receive this ministry that will enact and make manifest and materialize a promise regarding you right Hallelujah God knew exactly where Abraham and Sarah lived he knew they lived in a tent he knew their address he knew knew everything about him amen he never had to Google it he never had to go down to the post office he never had to go look at the wanted posters amen he knew exactly where on his created Earth that son and daughter lived oh and God has visited Us in this generation turned it back to the audience you sister called her name told her her address Oh my he got it wrong no she just moved amen hell him knows where you live God knows your situation God knows your life circumstance God hears every prayer that you offer up to his throne of grace and mercy amen amen and he's come to reveal himself to you right as a very personal and compassionate and caring God that's right it's God's promise about you right that will bring him on the scene to make that promise manifest amen than you Lord I think of Moses oh my Moses went up there on the holy Mount was enveloped in a cloud Joshua was somewhere up there on the you know partially the way up the mountain and there stood those people around the base of the mountain trembling and quaking for fear but oh they were adoring Moses praise God that's our man that's our Prophet that's right that's our mighty deliver and now he's done got caught up in the cloud and we don't have any idea what's going on up there but we know it must be something glorious and at the same time Janice and jambers that's were growing jealous he thinks he's the only Pebble on the beach he thinks he's the only bump on the pickle he thinks he's the only one through which God speaks and they get those people influenced away to build a golden calf you see what I'm saying it's such a fine line between truly recognizing that messenger and his purpose and then idolizing him into something above or apart from what God sent him to be amen right brother R said when Moses come down from that mountain he was Christ to those people right right amen right he was the word made flesh right to those people right and here's a group of them dancing around a golden calf well Moses is gone we might as well worship Aaron Moses is gone we might as well find us another icon Moses is gone we might as well find us another great preacher another great Pastor somebody to exalt somebody to lift up but don't you realize God has Moses up there for a purpose God took Moses up there so he can reveal to Moses a pattern and a plan and a predestinated will for Moses to convey back to the people right and if they can have only realize when Moses come back down from the mountain he had this great long list of instructions the Lord had give them here's how to build the Tabernacle in the wilderness here's how to build the outer Court the inner Court the holiest of holies here's how to build the veil here's how to build the altars of sacrifice here's how to build The Mercy Seat the Ark of the Covenant the table all these different things here's how to do all this Moses said God how in the world am I going to do all this he said you're not he said you're going to take this Revelation this blueprint this pattern back down to the people I imagine Moses we on the backside of the desert we ain't even got a Walmart we ain't got a Dollar General much less a Walmart where are we going to get this gold where are we going to get this wood where are we going to get this Lon and this Scarlet and all these things you know what God said it's there every bit of this material is there and Moses said well God you know I ain't a carpenter you know I'm not skilled in brass and gold and silver and in Linens and all this things God said no you're not expected to be they're gifted the gifts are in the body and they've been there the entire time and those elements are within that Earth even in that desert and they they've been there the on time but it's going to take a wisdom it's going to take a revelation it's going to take the mind of God conveyed through a message to Quicken those gifts to life and to bring those materials out of the earth and to formed them into objects of worship and objects of sacrifice and if oh if the people could have only realize if we'll take the message that has been brought to us and we'll apply it to our lives and will allow the gifts and the callings and the Ministries that God has gifted us with to take from the earth and from our everyday lives and from all the things around us once we get stay with me for a moment once we through the ministry of Moses and under his leadership and Direction get what God had in his mind materialized manifested and expressed into a literal and physical tangible Sanctuary here on Earth guess what you won't have to go to the foot of the mountain and watch and admire and adore as Moses alone gets caught up into the your kind of Glory God's whole desire God's whole purpose in bringing Moses up there was to charge him was to endow upon him this great Revelation that when Moses brought it to the people and it became materialized on the surface of the Earth that great God and His glory could descend right down past the mountain past those all those objects and come right down in that sanctuary and then have direct interaction and contact with those people to get Moses out of the picture as a central figure or as a worship figure and to say I El him desire to dwell with my people I want them to experience the same thing Moses did and what I did before them to him up here on the this mountain is an illustration or an example of what I desire to do for each and every individual one of them if they'll believe that message if they'll take the things that's been preached to them and apply it to their lives oh my brother oh my sister what in the hour that we live in look at for just very quickly the anointings there was four living creatures a lion an ox a a man and a flying eagle spiritual powers that were released through the seven Church ages to enable the elect of those ages to withstand the enemy and the power of Satan and the opposition that they would face through the Dark Ages through all of those periods those people sacrificing their lives under that Ox anointing go up and ask how do you do it why do you do it how do you explain your conduct how do you explain your actions how do you describe what you're feeling when you walk up there to a stake and you don't even need them to tie you to it and they cover your body in pitch and in tar and then light you a fire and you stand there and praise God that you could be counted worthy to die as Christ did as a mar for the cause how do you do it they would say I don't know it's not within my own power it's not within my own ability but there is an anointing there is a supernatural power of God that has been released which propels me forward which enables me to conduct myself in this way amen it's unexplainable to the world they can't Des cribe it they can't comprehend it they can't understand it but it is an anointing that has been released to Quicken the people that age to manifest their portion of the word for that age amen right look at Elisha in the school of prophets there's the prophets where's Elisha Elijah Where did Elijah go is he coming back how is he coming back is he going to fly an airplane oh is he going to build a tent come on brother is he going to set up a worldwide platform come on I tell you one thing when Elisha went back down there to Jordan River he wasn't whining and crying about where Elijah was Heen he saw beyond the bell he saw Beyond The Tabernacle he saw Beyond amen The Faults and failures and he said where is the god of Elijah because the same God the same man the same anointing has fallen upon a bride that's right that's not nervous that's not frightful that's not in a frenzy over what happened to the prophet she realizes that the prophet was sent here to display what God desired to do through the Elisha through the Believers of that message and he said I'm not ashamed to ask for double abortion because it's not to glorify me it's not to lift me up or exalt me or to double my earnings or double you know Spike My ratings it's to glorify God right praise the name of the Lord we've been anointed in this hour to believe this message I'm coming to a close here everybody say amen amen amen sometimes I get more amens when I say I'm closing I want to think I want you to think with me for a moment the restoration of the brid tree brother Reb said four death Messengers destroyed that bride tree right but he said it took four restoration four life Messengers to bring it back forth from the earth what was it bringing it back to its original condition its original state God's original plan and purpose for that brid tree so Along Comes A man raises up there in in Europe Martin Luther right Nails 90 thesis to the door of the Catholic church in Wittenberg Germany and under one portion of scripture the just shall live by faith he leads the Protestant Reformation righten anointed the man was anointed of God he was a light to that age to pierce through the darkness and say you don't have to confess your sins to the Man in the Box you don't have to pay to get your loved ones out of purgatory you don't have to pay to prepay indulgences for things that sins that you're planning to commit how ridiculous are some of these things that are enacted when the Simplicity of the word is forfeited but Luther wrotes up with Revelation the just shall live by faith and he preached a message of justification now hang with me here a minute brother and sister he preached justification is that right now I want to tell you I want to I want to just share with you this evening he didn't just preach a doct right he didn't just preach you know you just shall live by faith and you grab up Luther's uh you know message and say hey praise God the just shall live by faith I believe it I'm in no it didn't just produce a Theology of justification it didn't just produce a doctrine of justification it didn't only produce a teaching of justification but it actually produced Justified lives now there's where we're getting to right not just a Doctrine or a theology but an actual life lived right no doubt there was many people who smoked their cigars drank their beers and said I believe the doctrine of justification but there was an elected group of people who were the predestinated seed of God for that hour they heard that message of faith based on the Bible the Holy Spirit quickened it and they live a Justified life right amen are you with me along come Wesley he preached sanctification now you could say I believe the message I believe brother Wesley I love him I love his family I love you know hunting with him fishing with him horseback riding with him and all these things you with me I believe the doctrine of sanctification but if you kept on smoking your cigar and you kept on guzzling down the booze and you kept on living IM moreal life it was evident you didn't have a revelation of sanctification because sanctification is more than a belief it's more than a Doctrine but the B said we do not convert people to Christianity by its laws and by its rules it has to be a born again experience amen so the doctrine or the message of sanctification prod used Sanctified lives amongst those who was predestinated to receive that life it quickened their their hearts it quickened their souls it quickened their lives to live a Sanctified life that's right right we're going somewhere are you with me then we come down to 1906 isusa Street the day of Pentecost now it's time for another stage of restoration amen because caus the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts is an essential part of the four stages of restoration so here they are brother here they are sister seated down there in a barn down in isua Street California with from what I understand was a blind black preacher is that right right is that the is that the church history is that the facts he was down there preaching oh my behold in the last days sayith the Lord of hosts I'll pour out my spirit on All Flesh he began preaching not even realizing what he was doing but under an anointing that was beg to be released for that hour that old colored man may be blind in one or both eyes amen but had some spiritual Insight hav had some spiritual Revelation he begins preaching I will restore sayith the Lord I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh well we all know how this happened don't we we all know how this went about here they were seated in that real fine Barn no doubt they didn't have chandeliers they didn't have gold on the walls they didn't have a whole lot of you know finery to be proud of and they sat there and they snored and they snoo used and they looked at their watches and they cut their eyes at one another while the the the the man preached the restoration of the gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God I believe that I I put in my offering and I go home is that the way it happened no it didn't just produce a doctrine of the restoration of the gifts it didn't just produce a Theology of the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother something struck that place something came some Dynamics fell to strike those mechanics why because the hour had arrived right that message had been read those scriptures had been read for 2,000 years brother Aaron but now it was time for that portion of the word to be quickened and he preached the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God confirmed with signs and wonders following and out of that Barn amen out of that Barn did a Revival known as the Pentecostal Revival which set the stage and set the platform and begin Gathering the elect of that age for a message that was going to follow amen because oh Hallelujah we needed the fullness of the word restored we needed everything that had been forfeited beginning in N Rome the Grievous wolves that Paul saw coming into the church we needed all of that restored and in addition to that we needed the Thunders we needed the seven Shields we needed the Mysteries that had been contained in the back part of God's mind since the foundation of the world to be revealed so the prophet of God comes along and he lives an unusual life he has a strange way of presenting his message he's humble he's simple he comes and he speaks of the poles and he talks about fishing and a shoe with laces and a ENT and little room and all these and the world began scratching their head what is this you know you know he was a great healer he had great signs and wonders following his ministry he prayed for the King George of England he prayed for uh you know the the senator there all these different things but now what is this unusual behavior what are these strange mannerisms that are being exhibited forth through the life of the Prophet it's showing something he comes and preaches the message I believe it was 1961 rejected King the other morning I was lying on my back um 53 years to haven't done anything for the Lord all of a sudden he said I felt myself lifting up I saw my body lying there on the bed he went past the curtain of time right remember those Old Testament prophets encountered things that were not even entirely for them but was for the people they were sent to amen maybe they themselves weren't going into idolatry but the people were and the life and ministries of those prophets was illustrating what the people were going into here comes a prop he goes beyond the curtain of time Oh my he comes back and says it'll take perfect love to get there whatever you do don't miss it he goes Amen in the regions of the Lost he says at all cost avoid going to that place amen and then he goes out to to to Tucson Arizona out there to Sabina Canyon amen he has his hands up in the air praising the Lord a sword drops in his hand what is that friend it's a type it's a shadow it's a symbol of something that's coming upon the people there is a bride that has been predestinated to hear that message and to live forth those things we have been given the sword of the word of God in this hour and it's not to cut each other apart amen it's not to start sword fights it's not to start off fencing competition but it's to destroy our enemy it's to destroy cancer it's to destroy schisms in the body it's to destroy anything that stands between you and what God has purpos you to come to in this hour and the voice said this is not a sword this is the King's sword it was a golden scepter that was extended by the king to show there was a bride on the face of the Earth that when she received that word it would bring her and to his presence oh I feel like preaching now it didn't come just to give us theology it didn't come just to tell us I know the seals I know the godhead I know water baptism I know serpent seed I'll say this he didn't just preach the Rapture to produce a Rapture Doctrine that's right he didn't just preach the Rapture to give our heads something to spin the minds of the secular theologians he preached a Rapture because it was now time Hallelujah for a group of people to receive that Rapture message and to hear that shout and say there something on the inside of me that will respond to that voice and produce a translated body in the son and Daughters of God Amen Have You Been Changed by the message have you been changed amen by the standard of Holiness that was preached Have You Been Changed by the truth of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost has the prophet's message transformed your life he didn't come to make us idolize William Bram right it didn't come to make him a figure of worship that the bride lifts up but it come to show brother and sister what God was able to achieve and accomplish in the life of one surrendered vessel right just as Christ was waved before the people Alpha Jesus Christ has been waved waved over the people again in this hour to show right there's more coming right there's more with that same life that same DNA that same identity that same signs and wonders and healings and the love that Christ showed they're out there they're out there in the field they're already in existence the materials is already there right the Rapture brother said is already inside of you amen but it will take this message it will take the Holy Spirit to Quicken that and bring it into manifestation as they come back to the music tonight I want you to listen to this brother Reed talking about the seven Messengers he says how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of that Main Bowl because they had their Wicks dipped therein each Church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost his Wick life has been immersed in Christ through that Wick he is drawing the very Life of Christ and it and by it gives out light to the church what kind of a light is he giving the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit and right on down the ages to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested by a life that is hid with Christ in God are you listening and this Comfort is not for the seven Church age Messengers only oh I remember first time I got a computer my wife bought me this computer Compu and one of the first things I did when I hooked up the internet was I found a I found a message chat site brother well you don't got one like this one I guarantee you that I got on there they were just talking back and forth and they said oh we got a brother coming on here in the minute to preach and they were typing you know he was going to type his sermon out there sure enough here you come on about 10 minutes later praise the Lord God bless you all and they type God bless you we're going to read tonight from we're going to go to scripture so and so amen can you type a few more things praise the Lord I thought this this is not the apostolic pattern I'm sorry I I and y'all forgive me for this but I told my wife I said I'm going to just take my hands and rake it across some key three or four times send it off and said I'm sorry I'm a Pentecostal can somebody interpret you know but they get on there you know and you get all kind of garbage people that they ain't going to darken the doors of a church ain't going to have a pastor ain't going to have headship they're waiting on the prophet to return all the supernatural was done in the prophet all the bride's Ministry was wrapped up in the prophet and here brother B says this Comfort is not for the seven Church age Messengers only every True Believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer what God gives the messenger and How He blesses and uses the messenger is an example is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body amen I thank God for what he's done right in the life and Ministry of Brother Brad I thank God that he was translated beyond the curtain but I don't let that exalt brother bradam in my mind to a position of worship because he told John worship God I'm your fellow servant I'm your brother this is the testimony of Jesus Christ this is the spirit of Prophecy prophets are likened unto Eagles we are in the eagle age under the eagle anointing Anointed with the same prophecy The Same Spirit that brother venam was now what is prophecy it's the mind of God revealed it's the plan of God revealed it's God's purpose for the hour revealed through a prophetic Ministry now I don't believe we need an eighth messenger I don't believe we need anybody else to come up and complete anything that they suppose brother bradam left unfinished but I do believe that we must come under the same anointing that we may live out and act out the things that were prophesied through the ministry of the prophet and one of those things is the TR body change one of those things is a translation and brother and sister by the grace of God I believe with all my heart that I will become the very living expression amen of what was shattered and tiped and Illustrated through the life of that Prophet I believe that is the testimony of Jesus Christ and I believe that is the spirit of Prophecy let's stand to our feet this evening God is so good God is so good God is so good he's so good to to me God is so good God is so good God is so good he's so good to he
