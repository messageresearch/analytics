[25:45] over and have preeminence in Jesus name
[25:48] amen all right let's go to John
[25:51] 1 and then I'll let you be seated and
[25:54] then I want to give you just a little
[25:55] short
[25:56] testimony in the beginning was the word
[26:00] and the Word was with God and the Word
[26:01] was God the same was in the beginning
[26:05] with God all things were made by him who
[26:09] the word right all things were made by
[26:12] him and without him was not anything
[26:14] made that was made okay I I really like
[26:18] what brother dick uh his view of the
[26:21] Creator because you can say God mean
[26:23] many things but there's only one guy
[26:26] that can create amen amen that's the
[26:28] almighty Satan can't Satan can be called
[26:30] God he can be worshiped as God but you
[26:33] can't have a Creator only one you can
[26:36] only have one Creator and that's that's
[26:38] the uh that's the almighty in him was
[26:41] life and the life was the light of men
[26:45] and the light shineth in darkness and
[26:46] the Darkness comprehended it not you may
[26:50] be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to
[26:51] the reading of his word we're going to U
[26:55] um try to bring something a little
[26:57] unusual or the ones in the Sunday school
[26:58] class they uh they know where I'm going
[27:01] because we've been studying on this and
[27:02] if any of you would like to attend or
[27:05] either watch online we're doing a um uh
[27:09] a subject called the three sons names
[27:11] remember God comes in three son's name
[27:14] comes in the Son of God the son of man
[27:16] son of David and in all that is a lot of
[27:20] things but to understand those three you
[27:24] must understand those dispensations
[27:25] because to be in if everybody says well
[27:27] we're in the son of man
[27:31] dispensation okay what is
[27:35] it Son of God dispensation what is it
[27:38] all right so that's where that we're
[27:40] going to look at today and bring
[27:43] something maybe a little bit different
[27:46] than what you thought before but you
[27:48] know when you say the word
[27:51] logos that just kind of blows your brain
[27:53] because you like that's for the scholars
[27:55] and that's for you know and we've had
[27:57] all these explanations but today I'd
[27:59] like to maybe bring it down to where
[28:02] it's very very simple what the logos is
[28:06] not what it was what it is but just for
[28:09] a moment for Testimony I want to tell
[28:10] you a little something comical that
[28:11] happened the other day that uh I told
[28:14] the ones downstairs so I'll tell you up
[28:16] here I was U cutting grass in Gillsville
[28:20] and and uh they've got a place there
[28:22] that I don't know why it's there but
[28:24] it's full of mud and I was a little bit
[28:27] behind so I kind of got a little bit
[28:29] close to the
[28:30] edge and went off in the hole well make
[28:34] a long story short I got stuck so I got
[28:37] stuck and I couldn't get out so I'm and
[28:39] as I'm trying to get out I'm almost out
[28:41] you know and I said well thank you Lord
[28:43] you know I'm you know I'm behind and I
[28:46] need to get this done and I'm you know
[28:48] I'm I can be on schedule if I get this
[28:50] done and then I knew that if I got stuck
[28:53] with those kind of lawnmowers you can't
[28:55] one person can't get them out
[28:57] because with a hydrostat transmission
[29:00] somebody's got to be driving it when
[29:01] somebody's pulling it or you're just
[29:02] going to be dragging dead weight so it
[29:04] has to take two people so I was the only
[29:06] one there and U so I'm almost out
[29:09] brother dick and I get almost out of
[29:10] that mud hole and it went I mean it
[29:13] stopped I had already dug such a rut
[29:17] till when it got to dry ground it had
[29:19] made such a rut it stopped couldn't get
[29:21] out back and forth and I you know I was
[29:23] kind of having a pity party I said Lord
[29:25] you know you've helped me do this and
[29:26] you've helped me do that can you not
[29:28] help me get out of this you
[29:30] know and I was you know and I wasn't
[29:32] blaming the Lord I was blaming me but I
[29:34] was wanting him to help me sister Anna
[29:35] you know I needed some
[29:37] help so I you know I so I get my cell
[29:40] phone out and I'm walking back to the
[29:41] truck and I'm mumbling and muttering to
[29:43] myself you know and I get on the cell
[29:45] phone and I call
[29:47] Daddy ring ring ring no
[29:50] answer I call the house ring ring ring
[29:53] no answer so I call and I get terance
[29:59] it was a day that ended in why so he was
[30:01] playing
[30:02] golf so he was in Gainesville he said
[30:06] well I'll try to find
[30:07] Zach of course by that time um man
[30:12] pulled up an older gentleman he said you
[30:16] need some help buddy I said yeah I
[30:17] believe I do he said well get in here he
[30:20] said I pull that other guy out of that
[30:21] hole couple years couple years ago that
[30:23] was the guy that did it before me so I
[30:25] didn't feel so dumb so so he said I'll
[30:28] help you come get out of that so he you
[30:30] know I get in the car with him and and
[30:32] it wasn't too far it was 2 300 yards and
[30:36] so I turn around you know and he I get
[30:38] in the car with him we go we hook it up
[30:40] well his son pulls up he said son says
[30:42] son says hey I got a rope so we'll just
[30:44] pull you out right here so in other
[30:45] words two minutes later I was out and
[30:47] going about my work well they drove off
[30:50] they I said I owe you anything they said
[30:52] no you don't owe me nothing don't worry
[30:53] about it so going down the road well I
[30:56] got from here to that door I'm like man
[30:59] Brother Richard I saved like 30 minutes
[31:01] cuz that's why I have to go find
[31:02] somebody to come get me out so I saved
[31:05] about 30 minutes or 45 so I got about
[31:08] from here to that
[31:10] door and something came on
[31:13] me and
[31:15] said what have you been
[31:18] preaching because usually when not not
[31:20] here but most of the time in other
[31:23] services I bring in the cup of water in
[31:26] my name
[31:27] uh sermon that you seem very
[31:29] insignificant but if a if a man changed
[31:32] your tire and I got to thinking I
[31:36] thought
[31:38] H and I said well Lord I'm
[31:41] sorry he said you know
[31:44] what he said if I have got you out you
[31:47] wouldn't have to called your
[31:50] daddy he said if your daddy had got you
[31:53] out wouldn't had to call your brother
[31:57] if your brother would have got you out
[32:00] that man would have never had a
[32:04] chance that man would have never had a
[32:06] chance and he said now that man has a
[32:09] chance at the white Throne judgment he
[32:12] has a chance to be given eternal life
[32:14] for helping me and I thought I was
[32:17] crying like a
[32:19] baby in all my pity
[32:22] party think about it though think about
[32:25] your problem though and your situations
[32:27] life that you come up to a place and you
[32:28] go why did that
[32:30] happen it wasn't for
[32:34] you it was for someone
[32:36] else but you it had to come through
[32:40] you because just you know some common
[32:44] person helping some common person they
[32:46] just help each other that's just good
[32:48] but when you help a child of God that's
[32:50] right he said I'll not forget it here or
[32:52] not forget it then so I just believe the
[32:54] man and his son will be blessed here and
[32:56] the be blessed in glory but if I'd have
[32:59] been able to get in touch with with Dad
[33:01] he'd have come pull me out you that's
[33:03] what was coming to me and I don't know
[33:05] if God speaks to you but he speaks to me
[33:06] in my voice right right I I've not heard
[33:10] but one time an audible voice that
[33:12] didn't sound like me talking to
[33:14] me hello it's me usually talking to me
[33:17] is who it is but through that God used
[33:20] that and said if he would have been here
[33:22] you would have had you wouldn't that man
[33:24] would have never had a chance and I
[33:26] thought Lord I'll never argue I'll never
[33:29] complain about a situation again that
[33:32] comes up that I think that I have a
[33:36] problem so you just thank God that he's
[33:41] G us a revelation you think God you
[33:43] talking about brother Dale this morning
[33:44] talking about a child of God now look to
[33:47] me that to me that's just an experience
[33:50] that helps me but it does show me that I
[33:52] am a child of God that God thought
[33:55] enough of me to stop me and say look
[33:57] buddy you see what you see what just
[34:00] happened all right and then you go into
[34:02] that situation so uh if anything happens
[34:06] like that to you start looking around if
[34:08] you're a child of God then it must be
[34:10] something that God has because remember
[34:13] God doesn't do anything haphazard he has
[34:16] already got this thing planned out he
[34:18] already knew what was going to happen
[34:20] then because see and I was texting Dad
[34:23] and Mom that night because I asked him I
[34:25] said did you not get my phone call he
[34:27] said no I didn't get my phone call and
[34:28] he picked his phone up and he said yeah
[34:29] you called at
[34:31] 147 right and he said well mom was at
[34:35] home why didn't she answer the phone
[34:36] mama said I don't know we were busy I
[34:38] wasn't answering the phone you know so I
[34:40] mean you see how God worked all that out
[34:43] to when I looked at Daddy's phone I knew
[34:45] you know I said well that's why cuz his
[34:47] phone said I called him at 147 he said
[34:49] no you didn't call me I said yeah I did
[34:51] I tried to call you so in situations
[34:54] like that God saw before the foundation
[34:55] of the world that all that that was
[34:57] going to work together and that that man
[34:59] could have an opportunity to receive
[35:02] eternal life just for helping a child of
[35:05] God so say so don't don't miss those
[35:07] opportunities when we're having py
[35:10] parties remember one thing you might be
[35:12] having that pity party and somebody else
[35:15] may be receiving eternal life so what
[35:17] better I mean you can't put money on
[35:19] that you can't put money or you can't
[35:21] put anything on that but what happened
[35:23] right there in that little 5 minute
[35:24] length of time is worth an eternity amen
[35:29] so but hey we got we are the children of
[35:31] God we get the benefits and the people
[35:33] around us get the benefits right cuz you
[35:36] know brother Brown said the United
[35:37] States is doomed and and and you know
[35:40] ready for Destruction but we what we're
[35:43] friends of Israel so God has blessed us
[35:45] from being for being the friends of
[35:46] Israel of course we know why the bombs
[35:48] are not falling on us now because you
[35:49] and I are here all right so let's go
[35:52] into this and let's look at this first
[35:55] form and let's go to the first back to
[35:59] John 1:1 it says in the beginning was
[36:01] the word and the Word was with God and
[36:04] the Word was
[36:06] God now that
[36:09] word word in the Greek lexican is
[36:14] logos okay that word logos now you can
[36:18] go to to the explanation of logos
[36:20] because we've had many things that that
[36:22] have that have come about that it's it's
[36:25] were it's speech and and all this and
[36:27] we're going to develop into something
[36:29] here and see what um see what the Lord
[36:31] has for us I know we've been enjoying it
[36:33] down in the Sunday school class and um
[36:35] and we may have brought something that
[36:36] may help you understand that word logos
[36:40] but it's it has to do with a word it's
[36:42] uttered by a living voice amen and like
[36:45] brother Dale was talking about uh the
[36:48] Lord had showed him some things about
[36:49] that and it is the only way you can
[36:52] speak is to have air
[36:55] right when you're speaking speaking like
[36:57] I'm speaking now I have to use air that
[36:59] comes out of my lungs goes over my vocal
[37:01] cords and it has to speak well see now I
[37:04] can understand where brother brandom
[37:06] says now before this he said there was
[37:09] nothing yeah he said there was no air
[37:12] there was no molecule there was no
[37:15] anything and then this person comes
[37:17] forth and says Let There be when that
[37:20] person says Let There Be there's got to
[37:21] be some air there's got to be something
[37:24] that has developed and listen before we
[37:26] get started into this real good remember
[37:28] one thing this is not for God's
[37:33] benefit this is for our benefit to be
[37:37] able to understand a God that we were
[37:39] talking about it downstairs you you you
[37:41] got to keep just keep going back and
[37:43] keep going
[37:44] back how are you going to understand
[37:47] Eternal you and I have a beginning and
[37:49] we're looking toward an end we have time
[37:52] and we have all these things but you
[37:53] know God before the foundation of the
[37:55] world he knew what this man in India
[37:58] right now is thinking what day he was
[38:00] born what he thought every day and what
[38:02] day he would
[38:04] die every person in the that's ever been
[38:07] born since the beginning of time God
[38:09] knew their thoughts before it ever
[38:10] started now how can you understand that
[38:13] I can't understand it and how can he be
[38:15] standing right here today and be in the
[38:17] next church or how can he be over in
[38:19] India or be over in Africa how can be he
[38:21] be there he's ever present you and I are
[38:24] not ever present amen so God has to
[38:27] bring a way though that shows us who he
[38:32] is cuz we must understand God right amen
[38:36] amen we must understand God why because
[38:38] God is doing something for us we got
[38:40] just like me and that
[38:42] lawnmower I had a human
[38:45] moment right I had a human moment that
[38:48] wasn't a supernatural moment it was but
[38:51] I didn't know it till afterwards how
[38:52] many times brother Brown tell you I'll
[38:54] be in the vision and not even know it
[38:56] remember he was in that Vision that uh
[38:58] when he killed the bear and all that he
[39:00] was in that vision and didn't even know
[39:01] it all right till it sometimes till it
[39:03] was over so in our
[39:05] Humanity sometimes we forget that there
[39:08] is a little bit of Supernatural
[39:10] somewhere that God is
[39:12] using that you may not see it till after
[39:14] it's over with all right so same way
[39:17] with God to as God condescends there's
[39:19] no way that we can understand
[39:23] God so he has to put it in a form that
[39:26] we can understand right he has to put it
[39:30] in a form he has to put it in something
[39:32] so you and I can understand roll it up a
[39:34] little
[39:36] bit it's a decree a mandate or an order
[39:40] of the moral precepts given by God so we
[39:44] know and it's a a discourse the act of
[39:46] speaking or speech The Faculty of speech
[39:49] skill and practice and speaking now to
[39:52] be able to describe something you either
[39:55] got to have it written down or you you
[39:56] got to speak
[39:58] it all right there's got to be something
[40:01] in in us that's visual as human beings
[40:05] remember us not God all right so it's
[40:08] reason the mental faculty of thinking
[40:11] meditating reasoning calculating so
[40:15] remember God before the foundation of
[40:16] the world he doesn't make any mistakes
[40:20] right he makes no um missteps he has no
[40:25] uh he has no surprise
[40:27] he has no uh fear what he says is going
[40:31] to come to pass that's right so we must
[40:33] go back excuse me and look into the mind
[40:36] of God because that's where it all
[40:39] begins from all right now how can you do
[40:42] that you can do that by the Holy Ghost
[40:44] right because that is the mind of God
[40:47] Amen so that's why the brother R said
[40:50] what the new birth was the most
[40:51] important thing you could have because
[40:53] that is the creator living inside of you
[40:55] so what whatever he did in the beginning
[40:58] you will be able to understand that if
[41:01] you have the Holy Ghost and yield
[41:02] yourself to him I said if that's a big
[41:06] word if you yield yourself to him so we
[41:09] see this logos was the was God coming
[41:12] into a form but let's read quote number
[41:17] a and let's bring it from the mind of
[41:21] God the word become flesh and India trip
[41:24] God in the beginning back there when he
[41:25] seen the world he seen you and I here
[41:28] this morning he seen you and I here this
[41:30] morning he seen my babysitting back
[41:32] Yonder he seen every hungry person in
[41:34] India see how we can't comprehend that I
[41:38] mean how can you you could sit there and
[41:39] go crazy comprehending that this man
[41:41] knew this before he ever was here all
[41:44] right but we're getting ready to
[41:46] understand him if you'll hang on just a
[41:47] minute he seen every hungry person in
[41:49] India he seen every preacher in the pull
[41:52] pit he seen every hypocrite walking he
[41:54] seen the whole thing the infinite Mind
[41:57] Of God foresaw it and he said now to
[41:59] redeem that Fallen race I will send
[42:02] forth my son Christ Jesus there was the
[42:05] word in the beginning before it was a
[42:08] word now watch this you got to read this
[42:10] right or you'll make him say something
[42:11] he's not saying because in the beginning
[42:14] before it was a word it was a thought
[42:18] right before it was a thought yeah now
[42:22] don't you can't say before it was a
[42:24] thought cuz it wasn't word it was a
[42:26] thought first see before comma it was a
[42:30] thought it was expressed in a word amen
[42:34] and the word became material and dwelt
[42:36] Among Us so does everybody understand
[42:38] that it was a thought the thought of God
[42:42] is eternal and that those thoughts had
[42:44] to be expressed for us to be able to
[42:47] understand him because actually you and
[42:49] I were a part of that thought let's go
[42:50] to the next
[42:54] quote this is the proof of his res
[42:56] Resurrection 1955 I told him down in
[42:58] Sunday school class and I'm going to
[42:59] tell you does it matter what year he
[43:01] said
[43:02] it does it matter what sermon he said it
[43:05] in we don't even have to read these okay
[43:08] everybody's hung on well it's got to be
[43:10] before forget it don't even worry I'm
[43:12] not I don't even read those anymore it
[43:14] doesn't matter he said it and we believe
[43:17] it and we we're trying to understand it
[43:19] now keep going though the word speaks it
[43:22] his mind can't comprehend it talking
[43:24] about us because it's a human mind he's
[43:27] got to have the mind of God in him to
[43:30] understand Godly things see so all the
[43:33] reading all the schools all the teaching
[43:36] as good as they may be yet that's not
[43:39] the real principle yet all right so go
[43:42] to the next one keep going that's a
[43:45] continuation just there you go now look
[43:49] before he ever put the printed word and
[43:52] this is the mind of God now I'm I'm
[43:54] saying he's holding up this right is
[43:57] that okay is that a is that a good
[43:58] interpretation is that all right he was
[44:00] holding up this right and this is the
[44:03] mind of God cuz he print printed word
[44:06] all right here it is this is a mind of
[44:08] God that he thought before the
[44:09] foundation of the world was ever laid it
[44:11] is it's the reason he could put it on
[44:14] printed word and say what he would be
[44:16] because he saw it before the foundation
[44:19] of the world and knew just what it would
[44:21] be and spoke it out all right so this
[44:24] word is eternal amen Heaven and Earth
[44:26] will pass away but this word will never
[44:29] pass away because this is to me this is
[44:31] the mind of God this is what he
[44:33] thought this is his thoughts expressed
[44:36] in words so that you and me can
[44:38] understand it and for an eternity we
[44:40] still be in this amen all right let's go
[44:44] to the next one real quick I want to
[44:46] just set a little stage here where was
[44:48] Jesus slain at at Calvary
[44:52] no no sir Jesus was slain before the
[44:55] foundation of the world Behold the Lamb
[44:58] of God that was slain before the
[44:59] foundation of the world God in the
[45:00] beginning when he saw the sin he saw
[45:03] what would happened he spoke the word
[45:06] and Jesus was slain before the
[45:08] foundation of the world and every person
[45:10] was saved was saved according to the
[45:12] Bible when the lamb was slain in the
[45:14] mind of God before the foundation of the
[45:16] world you were included in Salvation
[45:19] then so what are you going to do about
[45:21] it brother Bob this morning was talking
[45:23] about
[45:24] fear if you can get a
[45:27] revelation that that has come to
[45:30] you and it has to come by process of the
[45:32] new birth not just that you just saw it
[45:34] and they just believed it no process of
[45:36] the New Birth by the process of the new
[45:38] birth which was that God did see you
[45:41] before the foundation world see that's
[45:42] why many people don't understand what
[45:44] brother brandham said right brother
[45:47] brandham is bringing it straight from
[45:49] the mind of God down to you but then
[45:52] he's got to he's got to bring certain
[45:54] things to the human to the human part of
[45:58] you you weren't Burnal a certain day you
[46:01] always was eternal you need eternal life
[46:04] you're dead and you're lost now how you
[46:06] put those two together he's talking to
[46:08] the human
[46:09] man amen because in the mind of God if
[46:12] you were saved you were saved then but
[46:15] you didn't know it we'll read this later
[46:17] on all right so everybody understand
[46:19] that before the foundation of the world
[46:21] Jesus was slain that's how Adam could
[46:23] get by with what he got by with right
[46:26] amen all right let's go next
[46:31] one keep going
[46:35] up cuz this is this is this is a long
[46:38] read from the church age book so this is
[46:40] going to sum part of it up in very plain
[46:42] language the true bride of Christ was in
[46:44] the mind of God eternally now when he
[46:47] when brother Brown talks about us being
[46:48] Eternal that's what it is right right
[46:51] the mind of God because the mind of God
[46:54] is eternal all
[46:56] right though not expressed until each
[46:59] came forth in the designated decree
[47:02] season you come to the altar you go
[47:04] through justification sanctification
[47:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost you receive
[47:07] the Life of Christ that was always with
[47:09] him before the foundation of the world
[47:12] he knew what day you were going to get
[47:13] it right very simple you didn't come
[47:16] here with
[47:18] it no you can come here with it you came
[47:21] here lost he came here with it right and
[47:26] then you have to accept it if the spirit
[47:28] of him that dwells in you I love that
[47:29] word if it's a big word as each member
[47:31] came forth it became what expressed so
[47:34] you had to you had to express it's like
[47:36] brother Dale was talking about this
[47:37] morning the only way for you to know
[47:39] that you got the new birth is you
[47:43] express right you express what's inside
[47:46] of you whether you're lost or or or or
[47:49] born again because you're an expression
[47:52] all right of one of the other the devil
[47:54] or or or or God came forth became
[47:58] expressed and took its place in the body
[48:00] so each of us have a place in the body
[48:02] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[48:05] word seed bride so there must to be what
[48:07] something spoken not something from the
[48:09] loins of Man by sex and though she is
[48:12] feminine in designation she is also
[48:14] called the body of Christ it is very
[48:16] apparent that she ought to be called
[48:18] that for she was predestinated in him
[48:21] came from the same Source was eternal
[48:24] with him what
[48:26] the part of the eternal life all right
[48:28] came from the same Source was eternal
[48:31] with him and is now
[48:33] manifesting God in a many membered body
[48:37] whereas once God was manifested in one
[48:40] member right even our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:43] now why I've always asked I've always
[48:46] asked the people that says that you know
[48:49] you always was eternal and all these
[48:51] things why wasn't the disciples they
[48:53] were standing there with him and even
[48:56] like brother Dale said he breathed on
[48:57] them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[48:59] now buddy that would have been that was
[49:01] the word himself right why couldn't they
[49:05] get it he hadn't died yet to release the
[49:08] life he was held by what the
[49:10] word or they would have received eternal
[49:13] life right there same way with you and I
[49:15] there's got to come a place and a time
[49:17] sure sure sure people sure kids God
[49:21] knows the day you're going to accept him
[49:23] but it's because he knew you would
[49:25] accept
[49:26] he had it ready for you and where did he
[49:28] have it ready for
[49:30] you in the word he had it ready for you
[49:33] your part to play it is in this word
[49:36] right here amen you got to find it
[49:38] though but your place is here that's why
[49:40] the word had to be swn in here for him
[49:43] to come and Quicken it it's the part
[49:45] that you needed that's right you know
[49:47] why God wrote
[49:49] this for you and me he wrote this for
[49:53] you and me for us to be able to come
[49:54] forth a s went forth to s the word right
[50:00] amen everybody all right you sleepy
[50:02] wedes say
[50:08] Amen wake
[50:11] up always gift the Sleepy
[50:15] Crowd Oh by the way brother Danny stand
[50:18] up stand up for a
[50:22] second what you got
[50:24] on that looks pretty good man it's
[50:27] catching
[50:29] on catching
[50:32] on I'll have some Baron Brothers around
[50:34] here for
[50:36] long I like it though I don't have to
[50:40] go but
[50:42] listen also pray for me I'm going to
[50:44] Jamaica in July the 8th and do a youth
[50:47] camp so pray for me July the 8th through
[50:51] the 13th so just keep me in your
[50:54] prayers that'll be kind of different for
[50:56] me to do but I think I might be able to
[50:58] act like
[51:00] one and not act right ah funny funny
[51:04] funny funny all right so explaining this
[51:08] logos or this part of God that brother
[51:12] Brown said went out from God not like an
[51:14] arm going off so the children can
[51:16] understand remember one thing like I
[51:19] said before God never
[51:21] changes he has never changed since the
[51:24] beginning of time
[51:27] right or he's not God so he hasn't
[51:30] changed he's the same person with the
[51:32] same attributes with the same
[51:36] manifestations he's the same man all
[51:38] right he's never
[51:41] changed so whatever he speaks that man
[51:45] can you not have some confidence if you
[51:47] knew brother Mark everything you spoke
[51:48] come to
[51:49] pass what kind of confidence would that
[51:51] be well you know
[51:54] what what's the an adopted son of God
[51:56] supposed to
[51:57] do sir hello what's an adopted God
[52:01] supposed to do the mind of God come
[52:03] right through the lips of man same thing
[52:06] we're living way below our
[52:07] privileges all right so let's look at
[52:09] this logos and let's and we know cuz I
[52:13] want to stay back cuz we know that logos
[52:17] is the Angel of the Covenant it what you
[52:18] see him down through the Old Testament
[52:20] when you see that even in John 1 that he
[52:23] says and the Word was made flesh so we
[52:25] know that logos became flesh amen so we
[52:29] can follow him down but let's keep him
[52:31] back and see what's going on this coming
[52:34] from the mind of God because remember
[52:37] coming from the mind of God there has to
[52:39] something literally come out exactly cuz
[52:43] remember he was slain before the
[52:44] foundation of the world but he was
[52:46] literally slain down here on the Earth
[52:48] right right he he could have stayed up
[52:51] there and been slain in the mind of God
[52:52] it wouldn't have done us any good he had
[52:55] to take on human flesh had to come down
[52:57] here and literally
[53:00] die to release the life to go back to
[53:04] where we come from amen all right so
[53:07] let's read quote number one now I want
[53:10] you now we're going to start and we're
[53:12] going to talk about this person called
[53:14] logos because it's not a different
[53:17] person children it's not something
[53:19] another man standing beside God as far
[53:22] as a different personality it's the same
[53:24] person
[53:25] he's just what revealing himself or
[53:28] making himself known to our finite mind
[53:31] all right so let's read this
[53:34] 1950 and we're taught in the beginning
[53:36] that the logos are the Son of God one
[53:39] out of God now so now the logos has
[53:41] picked up a title that's where we go
[53:43] where we're doing what we're doing
[53:45] downstairs is three sons names Son of
[53:48] God Son of Man son of David all right
[53:50] and we know he comes back as son of man
[53:52] in the end time right now but let's try
[53:54] to get get the other part together first
[53:57] now look and I want to settle this for
[53:59] you too because a lot of people when we
[54:01] were talking about the River Jordan they
[54:03] they bring this quote up now I do not
[54:05] believe in Eternal
[54:06] sunship now Eternal sunship according to
[54:10] the Catholics is that God had a
[54:15] son three people go father son Holy
[54:19] Ghost there's no way to have an eternal
[54:22] sunship
[54:24] right he said that's just not natural
[54:26] look he said that's even radical to even
[54:28] mention such a thing Eternal sunship he
[54:31] had an eternal sunship you say brother
[54:33] wait he's already said he's the son of
[54:34] God that's Eternal God the same person
[54:38] the Catholics and everybody else is
[54:39] bringing Eternal sunship in as another
[54:42] person everybody understand that that's
[54:44] why brother R didn't believe in Eternal
[54:46] sunship in that
[54:48] form but he did look he'll never lose
[54:52] this title a Son of God right right God
[54:55] doesn't gain them and then lose them he
[54:57] gains he doesn't gain them or lose them
[54:59] he just is what he is right all right so
[55:01] he's the son of God something that you
[55:03] and I can understand and if you want to
[55:06] call it a lower form of God brother
[55:07] random does one time it's a lower form
[55:09] of God for us to be able to understand
[55:12] him but not to be God and then he had a
[55:16] son that's okay so that's Eternal
[55:20] sunship there's no way that can be
[55:21] Eternal that's why you can't have three
[55:23] gods co-equal co-
[55:26] Eternal that's not sensible one God with
[55:31] many manifestations all right so he
[55:33] first was god Jehovah and out of him
[55:37] let's just picture now little drama so
[55:38] you can get it let's see coming out of
[55:41] space where there's nothing let's make
[55:44] it a little white light like a Mystic
[55:46] light like a Halo and that was the logos
[55:49] that went out of God in the beginning
[55:51] that was the son of God that came out of
[55:53] the bosom of the father
[55:55] that was what was in the beginning was
[55:57] what the word and the Word was with God
[56:01] and the Word was God that's why you go
[56:03] back to John 1 that word translated is
[56:05] logos so in the beginning was the logos
[56:07] the logos was with God and the logos was
[56:10] God all right and then to to denote
[56:14] where he was he was in the beginning
[56:15] with God all right so now and the Word
[56:19] was made flesh and dwelt among us so we
[56:21] know in the beginning was God and then
[56:23] out of God came the logos part of God
[56:26] that went out of god so let's go to the
[56:27] next quote we're going to read a few of
[56:29] these and then we'll get into what we're
[56:30] talking about now look and I want you to
[56:32] not get caught up because brother R uses
[56:34] this many
[56:36] times he said God covers all space Time
[56:38] and Eternity and he's this big
[56:40] light now look if God was a light and he
[56:43] began as a light you and I have to be a
[56:47] light right cuz he said let us make man
[56:49] in our image okay so God's always been a
[56:52] man okay
[56:55] like brother Dale said Moses met God in
[56:58] the burning bush but now all Moses
[57:00] Revelation was was a burning bush behind
[57:03] that burning bush had Moses saw a higher
[57:06] Revelation he would have seen a man
[57:08] standing there called Jesus Christ
[57:10] because that's what he saw when he
[57:12] walked past him and he said God I want
[57:14] to see you amen so it's so it's you know
[57:17] he said you can't see God you know the
[57:19] Bible says you can't God not you can't
[57:21] see God now why is that word see
[57:23] understand
[57:25] you got to translate that word to
[57:27] understand CU yeah we do see God it's
[57:29] Jesus Christ he said if you've seen me
[57:32] you've seen the
[57:34] father
[57:36] okay but the Bible says no man has seen
[57:38] God at any time okay nobody's understood
[57:40] God at any time but we're getting ready
[57:42] to understand him by this revealing or
[57:44] this unfolding of God but now watch what
[57:47] he says and then after he got all this
[57:49] creation made he said let us plural make
[57:51] man in our plural own image now now if
[57:55] God is unseen if the logos was in the
[57:58] form just mythically
[58:00] speaking all right so he's bringing this
[58:03] light in right and inside this light is
[58:06] a
[58:08] person don't wa and explain it cuz God
[58:11] wasn't a light and then he became a
[58:12] person we watched somebody do that one
[58:14] time on a video he brings this big
[58:17] pulsating light and then it drops down
[58:19] into an empty human form no God always
[58:23] was a human form
[58:25] he's just showing himself that you can't
[58:27] understand this big great light is that
[58:30] all right amen because remember he
[58:34] appeared over brother random in 1950 in
[58:36] the form of what a pillar of fire
[58:38] brother R said that was Jesus
[58:40] Christ amen the revelation of the camera
[58:43] was the Halo of light brother Brown knew
[58:45] who it was Paul same thing on the road
[58:48] to Damascus he saw a great light he says
[58:51] my Lord what he had a revelation but
[58:55] like brother Dale said everybody kind of
[58:56] puts that on Paul as his new birth he
[58:59] had to go visit
[59:02] anas and an I had to lay hands on him to
[59:05] receive the Holy Ghost
[59:07] right so it was something that was
[59:10] leading Paul to that experience but it
[59:12] wasn't the experience of the new birth
[59:15] because the life has to come through the
[59:17] body he couldn't receive listen have you
[59:19] ever thought about this he could why
[59:21] didn't Jesus just give him eternal life
[59:22] if he was already a seed of God and he
[59:24] had a seat why didn't God just say
[59:25] you're born again you you don't have to
[59:27] go nowhere no he said you get up and you
[59:30] go into that City and he's going to be a
[59:33] man named ananas he's going to meet you
[59:35] there pray for you that you get the Holy
[59:38] Ghost now why didn't God just give him
[59:40] the Holy Ghost brother call on the day
[59:41] on the road to Damascus why don't you
[59:43] just give it to him right then can't go
[59:45] past his word Seed Life must come
[59:47] through the body all right and who
[59:50] ananas was the body that that Paul had
[59:53] to receive the holy ghost from all right
[59:55] just mythically speaking drama so he's
[59:58] dramatizing right in the form of a Halo
[1:00:01] then it's supernatural then he had to
[1:00:03] make a man in his own image John 4 says
[1:00:05] that God is a spirit and he had to make
[1:00:07] a spirit man and he brought it down now
[1:00:10] there their's deity cannot be seen deity
[1:00:14] is the supernatural then he brings it
[1:00:16] down from a sacred Halo to a little
[1:00:18] white cloud something that's more
[1:00:20] visible that's man now man's not a cloud
[1:00:24] that's
[1:00:25] right man's not a cloud man's a man all
[1:00:29] right he gave him the rulership over the
[1:00:32] kingdom and he governed the Beast like
[1:00:34] the Holy Spirit leads the church today
[1:00:37] all right continue on cuz we know see
[1:00:39] then that logos began to speak and said
[1:00:41] let there be light and all those other
[1:00:43] things go to the
[1:00:49] next so then when God made his first man
[1:00:52] he was a spirit
[1:00:53] man all right so now he's bringing in
[1:00:55] Genesis 1:26 he was something in the
[1:00:58] order of God or the Son of God the logos
[1:01:01] now remember Adam if you go over in the
[1:01:03] Book of Luke in the in the genealogy of
[1:01:06] God what was Adam the last one Adam was
[1:01:10] a Son of God all right so Adam was a Son
[1:01:12] of God why because he had this logos in
[1:01:14] him amen amen he had this logos in Adam
[1:01:18] that's what God put in Adam the eternal
[1:01:20] life that God put in Adam was logos
[1:01:23] right amen
[1:01:25] now if we were look watch this right
[1:01:27] here that was the first man then he gave
[1:01:28] the man jurisdiction to lead the animal
[1:01:30] life just like the Holy Spirit leads the
[1:01:32] believer today go here do this roll
[1:01:35] scroll it up just a little
[1:01:36] bit brother M now if we were perfect in
[1:01:40] submission to the Holy Spirit God would
[1:01:42] lead us by the Holy Spirit just like
[1:01:44] Adam led the animals of that day
[1:01:48] Glory
[1:01:50] hello you read that I want you to read
[1:01:52] that while I take a drink
[1:01:56] now if we were perfect in submission to
[1:01:58] the Holy Spirit God would lead us by the
[1:02:01] Holy Spirit just like Adam L the animals
[1:02:03] of that day so the
[1:02:07] logos was the form of God to speak is
[1:02:12] that all right say amen amen amen that
[1:02:14] was the part of God that began to speak
[1:02:17] because look God thought it then he
[1:02:19] spoke
[1:02:22] it right and what he spoke had to come
[1:02:25] to pass because he's God he's the
[1:02:27] Creator I've always said the Bible even
[1:02:30] says Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[1:02:32] what does that mean brother bandam comes
[1:02:33] over into the future home and he says
[1:02:35] you look at that word pass away he said
[1:02:36] we think as in denominational terms that
[1:02:39] this world's going to be annihilated and
[1:02:41] God's going to bring a new one or we're
[1:02:42] going to heaven no when God made the sun
[1:02:47] it's been shining ever since he said let
[1:02:50] there be I believe those six days of
[1:02:52] creation that was an eternal creation
[1:02:56] Satan just came down and blackened or
[1:02:58] marred that for a time cuz this Earth is
[1:03:04] eternal a't it going to be brother Bram
[1:03:07] said only the sin is going to be knocked
[1:03:11] off of it
[1:03:12] right God's not going to annihilate
[1:03:14] something he's already created cuz he
[1:03:17] created it perfect so let's go to the
[1:03:18] next
[1:03:21] one now look all this talking about
[1:03:25] logos I was looking the other day and
[1:03:27] this is where the whole thought came
[1:03:29] from to understand that word logos which
[1:03:32] means
[1:03:33] speech word in other words
[1:03:37] description have you ever heard of the
[1:03:38] word logo
[1:03:41] yeah a symbol that is used to identify a
[1:03:44] company and that appears on its
[1:03:53] product add an S to that and you got the
[1:03:58] logos but that word logo comes from that
[1:04:01] it's in the same family of words so what
[1:04:04] is the
[1:04:05] logos the logos is a
[1:04:08] description of God how many of you been
[1:04:12] driving down the road and seen this
[1:04:13] right here turn go ahead first
[1:04:17] one I'll show you how God so simple it
[1:04:23] is what's the first thing you thought
[1:04:26] of hamburgers french fries right that's
[1:04:30] a
[1:04:32] logo right and that logo has progressed
[1:04:35] this was in 1953 this is the first one
[1:04:39] but as they progressed more and more and
[1:04:42] began to promote or to describe what
[1:04:45] their company was like now all you got
[1:04:47] to do is drive down the road and the
[1:04:49] kid's 3 years old goes
[1:04:52] hamburger well that don't say McDonald's
[1:04:54] does it does that say Hamburger does
[1:04:58] that say french fries soft drinks but in
[1:05:01] your brain what are you doing in your
[1:05:04] brain you're develop they have developed
[1:05:06] their logo to such a part to where you
[1:05:10] understand almost all of this but look
[1:05:12] that's only a
[1:05:14] m that's only a go we call it the golden
[1:05:18] arches that's a logo of the company but
[1:05:21] everything of that company is behind
[1:05:23] that same way with God when the logos
[1:05:26] come out it was God representing or I I
[1:05:29] you know I don't think God's going to
[1:05:31] going to cringe when I say this cuz he
[1:05:33] knew I was going to say it for the
[1:05:34] foundation of the world it's like a
[1:05:36] poster child the logos is a poster child
[1:05:39] he's one that steps forward and says
[1:05:41] this is what I'm all about you know you
[1:05:44] get a spokesperson we're not going to
[1:05:46] bring Ronald McDonald into this but he's
[1:05:49] the spokesperson if you see Ronald
[1:05:51] McDonald on the street you know that
[1:05:52] behind him is a company call McDonald's
[1:05:55] and they have employees and they have
[1:05:56] this and and you can go back even to the
[1:05:59] Salt and Pepper that they use you see
[1:06:01] what I'm talking about same way with God
[1:06:03] when the logos comes out he wants you to
[1:06:05] understand that's the logo of who he is
[1:06:09] all right same thing pull up the next
[1:06:11] one see each one of these companies have
[1:06:14] come this was 1978 that's kind of bland
[1:06:16] isn't it but now this is 2012 we know
[1:06:20] when you think of Microsoft what do you
[1:06:22] think of Bill Gates
[1:06:25] billionaire computers phones you know
[1:06:29] same thing with apple you see the logo
[1:06:32] and the logo is the representative of
[1:06:35] what's behind it now this is only one
[1:06:37] word that says Microsoft but you could
[1:06:39] sit down all day and you could give all
[1:06:43] the divisions and all the money and all
[1:06:45] the things they buy and all the things
[1:06:46] they produce and it'll take you forever
[1:06:49] listen it's the same way with God if he
[1:06:51] was to sit down and explain the
[1:06:55] logos you couldn't put it in this book
[1:06:57] right
[1:06:59] here right but but with the mind of God
[1:07:06] knowing what his logo
[1:07:09] is by the Holy Ghost your your human
[1:07:14] brain Redeemer healer savior Jehovah
[1:07:20] Mighty God Prince of Peace you can keep
[1:07:22] going all day long and through an
[1:07:24] eternity but that to so to understand a
[1:07:27] logo the logos it's the logo of God it's
[1:07:31] what God is McDonald's with that golden
[1:07:34] arches like I said it didn't say a word
[1:07:36] about hamburgers but that's the first
[1:07:37] thing come in your
[1:07:40] mind so the same thing with logos if you
[1:07:43] hear anybody talk about the logos that
[1:07:45] came out of God it's not a separate
[1:07:46] person it's God trying to express
[1:07:48] himself to me and you in the most simple
[1:07:52] terms because see I can can look at that
[1:07:54] logo and in very simple terms I can say
[1:07:56] I got one of
[1:07:57] those you know I don't understand how
[1:07:59] the thing works but Microsoft
[1:08:02] does I don't understand what God's doing
[1:08:05] sometimes but God does I don't
[1:08:08] understand how that computer can can
[1:08:10] process billions of bits and megabytes
[1:08:12] and all that in that little bitty box
[1:08:14] and then bring it out and we get to use
[1:08:16] it but man has simplified it so much to
[1:08:20] where we're able to just use it and then
[1:08:23] some people like brother join some of
[1:08:24] them that have learned more are you
[1:08:26] getting my point here that have learned
[1:08:28] more and studied
[1:08:30] more they have a different level of
[1:08:33] understanding what that Microsoft means
[1:08:35] amen Apostles prophets pastors teachers
[1:08:38] and evangelists God has given them a
[1:08:40] gift to be able to show you by the logo
[1:08:44] or the logos of God what God's talking
[1:08:47] about and what he's all about
[1:08:50] amen so do you understand a little
[1:08:53] little better now I did when I saw that
[1:08:55] I said man that's pretty simple cuz
[1:08:58] Scholars have called logos all these
[1:09:00] things but it's the logo of God it's
[1:09:03] what God is everything that God is is in
[1:09:05] wrapped up in that logos because you got
[1:09:07] Son of
[1:09:08] God who was in the son of
[1:09:10] man and the logos was made flesh amen
[1:09:15] who's going to be in the son of David
[1:09:16] the
[1:09:17] logos who's inside of you today the same
[1:09:21] logos is inside of you and the only way
[1:09:24] for you to understand God is to have
[1:09:26] that logos in you so that you can
[1:09:30] understand God that's right amen that's
[1:09:32] why he says Jesus said I come from
[1:09:35] God I go back to God now 10 years from
[1:09:39] now they may change this a little
[1:09:42] bit but you're still going to know what
[1:09:44] Microsoft is that's right amen remember
[1:09:47] God doesn't change but his ability to
[1:09:50] explain to
[1:09:52] you yeah
[1:09:54] his ability to explain it to you and for
[1:09:55] you to understand it may change we
[1:09:58] thought he was a trinity at one time oh
[1:10:00] yeah
[1:10:02] right
[1:10:04] right I love that smile G where's she
[1:10:08] been all our
[1:10:10] life bless your heart good to see I mean
[1:10:12] just I like a Zeal but you see that 10
[1:10:15] years from now you're still going to if
[1:10:17] you see that logo you're still going but
[1:10:19] you may understand more you may go to
[1:10:21] school you may go to school and learn
[1:10:23] how to read really break those things
[1:10:24] down and put the computer together same
[1:10:26] way with God brothers and sisters the
[1:10:28] logos of God is what is in you to teach
[1:10:33] you more about God that we can't
[1:10:36] understand there's no way you can
[1:10:38] understand God that's right there's no
[1:10:40] way you can understand and just like
[1:10:41] what happened to me the other day that
[1:10:43] was God doing that I didn't understand
[1:10:46] it at the time and I believe I got the
[1:10:48] logos inside of me but my stupid brain
[1:10:50] didn't filter it right
[1:10:52] right
[1:10:54] amen I was in the pity party
[1:10:57] Department God wasn't in the pity
[1:10:59] Department Department he was saving
[1:11:00] somebody Department amen so take that
[1:11:03] back down and let's read another quote
[1:11:04] the next one but everybody understand
[1:11:07] that kind of struck me that that would
[1:11:08] help us to understand God more it's the
[1:11:12] logo of God whatever God is is behind
[1:11:15] that Lo that logos exp to me explains
[1:11:17] everything now he said well he before
[1:11:20] that the logos was before that it's just
[1:11:22] God bringing it down to where we can
[1:11:24] understand what's going on all right now
[1:11:27] look let's keep reading he's going to
[1:11:28] bring it down a little further that look
[1:11:30] like a Halo hanging Yonder no man has
[1:11:32] seen God at any time now eye to eye and
[1:11:35] here's the logos see the logos steps
[1:11:37] forth the logos hey everybody when you
[1:11:40] have a logo for your company McDonald's
[1:11:42] has the highest
[1:11:44] pole right they don't unless there's an
[1:11:46] ordinance you don't put McDonald's you
[1:11:49] don't put the sign of McDonald's down
[1:11:51] here and hide it in a bush
[1:11:54] no when you driving down the interstate
[1:11:56] that's about the first thing you see cuz
[1:11:59] they put that thing as high as they can
[1:12:00] put it why so you can what see it first
[1:12:04] all right same way with God no man has
[1:12:05] seen God at any time now eye to eye and
[1:12:07] here's the logos looks like it's a
[1:12:09] supernatural being it's a Halo that's
[1:12:11] the Son of God now he goes back into
[1:12:14] Eternal sunship cuz the word don't don't
[1:12:17] go good together that's Catholic
[1:12:19] Doctrine how could it be a sunship be
[1:12:21] Eternal if he's a son he had to have a
[1:12:23] beginning
[1:12:24] amen but it was the logos that went out
[1:12:27] of God and there he was playing out
[1:12:29] there in space just like a child before
[1:12:31] the door I can see him draw the whole
[1:12:33] picture in his mind of the kingdom and
[1:12:36] what it might be and then the first
[1:12:39] thing you know I hear him say let there
[1:12:42] be light so God is just like brother R
[1:12:44] said it's a thought first and then it
[1:12:46] becomes word all right it's a thought
[1:12:48] you got to think of it first the only
[1:12:51] thing the only problem with us is we
[1:12:52] think about something study it mull it
[1:12:54] over think it may work it may not work
[1:12:58] and then maybe we speak it no what comes
[1:13:01] into God's mind he speaks it because
[1:13:03] that's Eternal it can't change it's
[1:13:05] right the first time all right then the
[1:13:08] first thing you know I hear him said let
[1:13:09] there be light and when he did an Adam
[1:13:11] broke you under well you can you know
[1:13:12] continue into the
[1:13:13] creation but keep going to the next
[1:13:17] one now look at him back there there he
[1:13:19] was standing there now light doesn't
[1:13:21] stand okay so it's a human being
[1:13:25] amen after all the clinkers you know he
[1:13:28] he makes that uh analogy of a child
[1:13:31] playing before the father's door it's
[1:13:32] kind of like a kind of like a kid
[1:13:34] playing with
[1:13:35] blocks but he's not a kid he's creating
[1:13:39] but what he's doing he's saiding okay I
[1:13:40] need the moon over here for a certain
[1:13:42] reason can you imagine somebody standing
[1:13:43] there just a Gil and all that's inside
[1:13:45] of it that's why we can't understand
[1:13:47] that man that he's standing there in
[1:13:49] eternity and there's nothing and all of
[1:13:51] a sudden he says let there be life light
[1:13:53] yeah Sunshine Sun you go right over
[1:13:56] there and you stay right here and it's
[1:13:58] been hanging there ever since I don't
[1:14:00] understand why people can't understand
[1:14:01] that there's a Creator
[1:14:03] somewhere this Earth is standing in the
[1:14:05] middle of space spending at about the
[1:14:07] same amount of time and it has been
[1:14:09] forever and there's not an intelligent
[1:14:12] something moveing this thing I I don't I
[1:14:15] don't
[1:14:16] understand but you know you see because
[1:14:19] brother R said God's writing his first
[1:14:20] Bible why is he writing his first Bible
[1:14:22] brother R says I won't read it he says
[1:14:24] he knew man would look up
[1:14:27] first it's not it's not it's in one of
[1:14:29] these quotes but I'm not going to read
[1:14:30] it for save time I don't want to be too
[1:14:32] long today but he said he God knew man
[1:14:34] would look
[1:14:35] up so he knew the first Bible would be
[1:14:38] in the Stars so he sat there and he put
[1:14:39] this one here and he put this one here
[1:14:41] he's just sitting there and he is like a
[1:14:43] kid but a kid's over here playing that
[1:14:45] God's not playing he's got a purpose
[1:14:48] because you know what that's going to
[1:14:49] stay there forever this is going to stay
[1:14:51] there forever the Earth's not going to
[1:14:53] move move out of his orbit now the orbit
[1:14:54] is going to tilt back up amen cuz we're
[1:14:57] doing this because of sin on the
[1:15:00] Earth right because of the flood what
[1:15:03] happened in the flood we got it off a
[1:15:05] little bit that's why it's 365 in the
[1:15:07] fourth day in the year but it's all
[1:15:10] going right back to the same what it was
[1:15:13] before because that's what God spoke sin
[1:15:16] has just marred it or left
[1:15:21] it till God comes here cleans this thing
[1:15:25] up first you know I was thinking about
[1:15:26] the other
[1:15:29] day Jesus was born into this world we
[1:15:32] know it was an Immaculate Conception it
[1:15:34] was an egg and a sperm that was put
[1:15:36] together by God himself created by God
[1:15:38] himself and put into
[1:15:40] Mary but being that it was put into Mary
[1:15:43] once it was put into Mary what Mary
[1:15:48] ate what Mary ate was connected to that
[1:15:51] body that's why he looked 50 something
[1:15:53] years old and he was only 30 the curse
[1:15:56] was on that body of his because of what
[1:15:59] Mary was eating and because what he eat
[1:16:01] when he got here he couldn't do anything
[1:16:04] about that because you know what that's
[1:16:05] what he said in Genesis 1 he said cursed
[1:16:08] is the ground that's the same way with
[1:16:10] you and I when we come up out of this
[1:16:12] ground and we're born we're
[1:16:14] cursed we're living in a curse that's
[1:16:16] why the Bible says I that we plant him
[1:16:18] in corruption and we raise him in
[1:16:20] incorruption amen we plant him in
[1:16:22] corruption but we rais him in
[1:16:23] incorruption because Jesus when he
[1:16:25] raised he raised incorrupted he was not
[1:16:28] corrupted when he raised so that's the
[1:16:30] same thing with Jesus you say well why
[1:16:32] did he look
[1:16:33] old he was eating cursed
[1:16:36] dirt that he had cursed before he he had
[1:16:39] cursed back in the garden
[1:16:42] amen all right so now look at him back
[1:16:44] there there he was standing there and
[1:16:46] then he continues on let's go keep going
[1:16:48] down and when he made everything that
[1:16:50] looked nice and good now he said let us
[1:16:52] plural make man plural in our own image
[1:16:54] what was he there is a supernatural
[1:16:56] being there's the one that could not be
[1:17:00] seen couldn't be seen right a logo is no
[1:17:03] good if you can't see it right just like
[1:17:05] I said took all the logos down and hide
[1:17:08] them you walk up to a building and go
[1:17:10] what is this place no now you walk up to
[1:17:13] a building and you see all their banners
[1:17:15] and all the things they tell you what's
[1:17:17] behind their what's in their building
[1:17:19] you don't go up to Texico and you you
[1:17:22] see they branded Texico and you go up to
[1:17:24] a Texico sign you go I think they sell
[1:17:26] hamburgers no they don't sell
[1:17:28] hamburgers you know they sell gas when
[1:17:31] you're out of gas you pull in a
[1:17:33] teso when your stomach's empty you pull
[1:17:35] in a McDonald's why they branded or made
[1:17:38] that logo so real I hope you're getting
[1:17:41] this they make that logo so real till
[1:17:44] you know what it is and when you just
[1:17:45] look at it in a split second you know
[1:17:47] what's behind that logo right same way
[1:17:50] with God when we begin to understand
[1:17:52] this logos or this son of God that's in
[1:17:55] you tonight if you have the new birth
[1:17:58] then you should be able to understand
[1:17:59] what all is behind it that's right
[1:18:03] right if you allow
[1:18:06] it there's the one that cannot be seen
[1:18:09] God the father never was seen never will
[1:18:11] be seen he's all nature and there he is
[1:18:14] and now here's the son which is the
[1:18:16] logos that went out of him Made In His
[1:18:20] Image so whatever the Loos look like
[1:18:23] what the father looks like that's right
[1:18:25] I've always said when when Adam the
[1:18:27] first time I believe when Adam turned
[1:18:28] and looked at God he said man I look
[1:18:32] like
[1:18:33] him and God looks at Adam and says he
[1:18:36] looks just like
[1:18:37] me we look alike why because that's
[1:18:40] where he came from
[1:18:42] right there's the one that couldnot be
[1:18:44] seen God the father never was seen never
[1:18:45] will be seen he's all nature there he is
[1:18:47] now here's the son which was the logos
[1:18:49] that went out of him Made In His Image a
[1:18:52] supernatural being that went out in the
[1:18:54] beginning now you say went out now let's
[1:18:56] explain that went
[1:18:59] out he didn't just go you know I go out
[1:19:02] the
[1:19:03] door okay God just didn't go out
[1:19:07] somewhere it's the form that he's using
[1:19:10] to explain himself all right he led the
[1:19:14] Beast around then like the holy
[1:19:17] spirit's can anybody read that say that
[1:19:19] would you supposed to lead the church
[1:19:23] today that's right he led the church
[1:19:25] around that's another thing you know I I
[1:19:28] I believe I the brother yesterday did a
[1:19:31] real good job very simple but did a good
[1:19:33] job you think my sermon is pretty U
[1:19:37] maybe carnal he his sermon was lounging
[1:19:39] around the
[1:19:42] pool the pool of
[1:19:44] Bethesda lounging around the pool and he
[1:19:46] made some real good points and one point
[1:19:49] he made and I really like it is is and I
[1:19:51] want to explain something to you
[1:19:54] to have the Holy Ghost that's the inside
[1:19:55] teacher and we know that some of us need
[1:19:57] help but we failed to read the quote
[1:20:00] where brother Bram says every time you
[1:20:02] come to the altar you get weaker now
[1:20:04] ain't know what he said you want me to
[1:20:06] find it I'll find it for you brother
[1:20:07] Bram says every time you come to the
[1:20:09] altar you get weaker he said you come
[1:20:11] one time you get prayed for you don't
[1:20:12] come back no more that's
[1:20:15] right amen why because you know that's
[1:20:18] what the an that's what the brother was
[1:20:20] saying he he was getting ready to pray
[1:20:21] for a brother and another brother
[1:20:22] brother's church and the Pastor said
[1:20:25] hold on a
[1:20:27] minute he said we prayed for that man
[1:20:30] three or four times and he said we're
[1:20:32] not praying for you no
[1:20:34] more and know what he said he said you
[1:20:36] either accept it he said you somehow you
[1:20:39] must be liking what you got cuz you come
[1:20:41] up here for every and you know you see
[1:20:43] like Daddy said you see many people in
[1:20:45] the in the youth camps the same person
[1:20:47] comes up every year they're just one
[1:20:48] year older every year they come up the
[1:20:51] same thing one year older why that
[1:20:53] brother finally stopped and he looked at
[1:20:55] that brother and he said look he said
[1:20:56] you're not willing to get rid of what
[1:20:59] you got he said when you're willing to
[1:21:01] get rid of what you got then God can
[1:21:04] help you but you just keep coming up
[1:21:06] here and going back coming up here and
[1:21:07] going back coming up here and going back
[1:21:10] shows you faith is
[1:21:13] weak Jesus said
[1:21:16] believe Centurion went to him one time
[1:21:19] he said I found no greater Faith so we
[1:21:21] see but the reason I made that point is
[1:21:23] just
[1:21:24] look supposed to lead the church
[1:21:28] today we have the full word of God
[1:21:31] brothers and sisters amen right and that
[1:21:34] full the word of God says to believe
[1:21:38] right even the Holy Ghost I want you to
[1:21:41] pray because I I want to when I go to
[1:21:43] Jamaica and do this Youth Camp I want to
[1:21:45] do it a little different than most
[1:21:46] people do it we're not going to do the
[1:21:49] crying and screaming and all that
[1:21:51] stuff they're either going to believe or
[1:21:54] they going to keep the same thing they
[1:21:55] got when I leave amen so you pray for me
[1:21:58] because I want to I'm trying to get a a
[1:22:01] few sermons together about inner
[1:22:04] strength because I'll just tell you the
[1:22:07] the story of
[1:22:08] Samson the story of Samson the Bible
[1:22:11] says the the Philistines went crazy they
[1:22:13] went Bonkers trying to find out he said
[1:22:17] they said where is the
[1:22:18] secret of Samson's strength now Samson
[1:22:22] would have been an Arnold
[1:22:24] Schwarzenegger 68 300 lb arms this big
[1:22:28] what secret is that there is no secret
[1:22:31] right the analogy I'm going to use is he
[1:22:33] looks like Barney 5 right Don not little
[1:22:37] because look they went Bonkers trying to
[1:22:40] find where his strength came from
[1:22:43] right and the Philistines remember the
[1:22:45] Philistines remember they were giants
[1:22:48] they were Fighters they loved to fight
[1:22:49] they wanted to know how this guy could
[1:22:51] pick up
[1:22:53] a city's Gates and him be probably about
[1:22:57] 5 foot tall weigh about 100 pound
[1:22:59] soaking
[1:23:01] wet right CU they the Bible keeps saying
[1:23:05] secret secret secret the secret was was
[1:23:09] Samson's Inner Strength it wasn't it
[1:23:12] didn't have anything to do with outside
[1:23:13] it was the inner strength that Samson
[1:23:16] had amen it was that hidden life in God
[1:23:21] God hiding him self in Simplicity Jesus
[1:23:24] was a common man they said right and
[1:23:27] actually the Bible says you didn't want
[1:23:28] to look at him he would may have been a
[1:23:30] little bit not very attractive what the
[1:23:33] Bible says do we even want to look on it
[1:23:35] so I want to I want to show those people
[1:23:38] the inner strength of God you got to
[1:23:40] have Inner Strength that's what brother
[1:23:42] Dale's preaching about and the only
[1:23:43] Inner Strength you gets a new
[1:23:45] birth you can get the Holy Ghost on your
[1:23:48] spirit and be anointed and do a lot of
[1:23:49] things but you get that Holy Ghost in
[1:23:51] your soul h
[1:23:53] you ain't got to preach Holiness you
[1:23:54] don't have to preach
[1:23:56] Holiness cuz when the Bible says for you
[1:23:58] not to put on a a a garment pertaining
[1:24:02] to the man why do the preacher have to
[1:24:04] tell you
[1:24:05] that why the preacher have to tell you
[1:24:07] that why the preacher I've tell you not
[1:24:09] to cut your hair the Bible tells you not
[1:24:10] to do that right brother Brown didn't
[1:24:12] bring us these things it was in the
[1:24:15] Bible all right so that's the same way I
[1:24:18] I want us to to get away from that of of
[1:24:21] of Dos and don't but if you get born
[1:24:23] again to me then brother Brown said it's
[1:24:26] a love
[1:24:27] affair right we do things because we
[1:24:30] love the Lord you know and like Jim said
[1:24:33] if if he can get on the cross and do the
[1:24:34] things he did and die for me what little
[1:24:36] bit can I do is to wear a dress and do
[1:24:40] what he says in the Bible and not cut my
[1:24:42] hair and do all those things that's a
[1:24:44] that's a very small thing versus a man
[1:24:47] giving his life for you very small same
[1:24:49] way with you and I oh a lot of times you
[1:24:52] know we as human beings go boy this
[1:24:54] person's successful and why is this one
[1:24:55] doing this why if you ain't born again
[1:24:57] it ain't going to matter right if ain't
[1:25:00] Born Again ain't going to
[1:25:02] matter you can be born again and live in
[1:25:04] a cave and be
[1:25:05] Eternal right or live in a trailer that
[1:25:08] ain't got to me it used to it used to
[1:25:10] bother me but that don't bother me no
[1:25:11] more money don't bother me no more than
[1:25:13] nothing because you can pile it all
[1:25:17] up and uh and well either the
[1:25:20] government's going to get it are the
[1:25:23] atomic bombs going to make it into Ash
[1:25:24] one of the
[1:25:27] two don't get me wrong it's okay to have
[1:25:29] some but but
[1:25:31] still the Bible has always said that
[1:25:35] it's better that you can pull a camel
[1:25:37] through the eye of a needle than to get
[1:25:39] a rich man into heaven cuz brother Ram
[1:25:40] said a rich man will lean to his money
[1:25:42] every time the Super Rich you watch them
[1:25:44] they do the same thing they sell their
[1:25:46] soul I don't know why I got into that
[1:25:47] but let's go to the next thing he put
[1:25:49] this supernatural being which was called
[1:25:51] what roll it up brother Bob wake up was
[1:25:54] called man the third person of the
[1:25:57] Trinity oh oh my goodness a prophet Lord
[1:26:00] have mercy
[1:26:05] look like brother Dale said he ought to
[1:26:07] put your third person of the
[1:26:10] Trinity Holy Spirit into mankind that's
[1:26:13] exactly right that man and he made him
[1:26:15] in his own image now you know what he's
[1:26:17] talking about he's
[1:26:18] addressing those people that were
[1:26:20] trinitarians at that time you know that
[1:26:22] if they were stuck into that in that age
[1:26:25] they didn't know no different the Holy
[1:26:27] Ghost was the third person of the
[1:26:28] Trinity to them but what's he trying to
[1:26:30] do he's trying to bring that out and
[1:26:31] explain that it's not three different
[1:26:35] separate people it's one person with
[1:26:37] three
[1:26:38] manifestation the triun of God not the
[1:26:41] Trinity see how close that is the devil
[1:26:43] many times is like brother Joe was
[1:26:45] talking about you know we
[1:26:47] um God teleported philli over to the
[1:26:51] Ethiopian in unit well see man now is
[1:26:53] trying to do the same thing in the
[1:26:56] carnal aspect he's trying to get man I
[1:26:58] mean wouldn't it be it's like he was
[1:27:00] talking about if you could if you could
[1:27:02] teleport something see a terrorist
[1:27:04] wouldn't have to go to your country to
[1:27:05] do it he just teleport a bomb from here
[1:27:07] over to the White House and boom blow it
[1:27:09] up so you see that's how Satan's doing
[1:27:11] it but God did it first always remember
[1:27:15] God's first he does everything first and
[1:27:18] then Satan behind him perverts it so
[1:27:21] let's go to the next one and then we'll
[1:27:22] quit right
[1:27:23] here excuse me questions and answers on
[1:27:27] Genesis now if God created man in his
[1:27:29] own image and his own likeness what kind
[1:27:31] of man did he create a spirit man now if
[1:27:35] you notice after you made all the
[1:27:37] creation and created a spirit man the
[1:27:38] close reading of this now to the one
[1:27:40] that asked the question will find this
[1:27:42] that God give dominion of the cattle and
[1:27:44] the fish and everything to the man but
[1:27:46] in his making up
[1:27:48] there he made him in his own image to
[1:27:50] lead the cattle lead the Beast of the
[1:27:51] field just like the Holy Spirit leads
[1:27:53] the believer today he was in other words
[1:27:56] Adam the first man in the lower creation
[1:27:59] the first creation was God himself
[1:28:00] that's what we just been talking about
[1:28:02] amen because what happened one day with
[1:28:05] Microsoft Microsoft Bill Gates and a
[1:28:07] couple other guys sat down around a
[1:28:09] table in in the late or middle
[1:28:11] 80s and they said we want to have
[1:28:15] computers but we really don't know how
[1:28:17] to do it but we're going to bring people
[1:28:19] in and we're going to what they do they
[1:28:21] developed a business plan there was no
[1:28:25] logo right but over time they developed
[1:28:30] a logo to go behind the business that
[1:28:32] they had created same way with God the
[1:28:36] only way listen the only way we can
[1:28:37] understand God Is by human
[1:28:39] stuff really honestly the only way we
[1:28:43] the only way I can understand
[1:28:45] adoption and things like that is by H by
[1:28:48] me being a human the only way I can
[1:28:50] understand one God is that I'm one
[1:28:51] person person but when my wife comes up
[1:28:53] to me I manifest a different
[1:28:57] attribute as a husband but now I'm also
[1:29:00] a
[1:29:01] granddaddy and Diana's not here today so
[1:29:03] I don't have to display that attribute
[1:29:05] but if she come running through that
[1:29:06] door y'all would just have to be
[1:29:08] quiet because I'd be a grandfather why
[1:29:11] I'm the same person though see the the
[1:29:13] way to understand God is to understand
[1:29:14] you and the way you grow up is the way
[1:29:16] you go through first grade all the way
[1:29:18] up to grade number 12 you learn by the
[1:29:21] things you
[1:29:22] suffer amen you learn by the things you
[1:29:25] s you know what the Bible says he grew
[1:29:27] in Grace and knowledge learned by the
[1:29:29] things he suffered same way with you and
[1:29:30] I we got to learn by the way we suffer
[1:29:32] but we must understand to understand
[1:29:34] this logos but in other words Adam the
[1:29:36] first man and the Lord creation of God
[1:29:38] the first creation was God himself
[1:29:41] now was the prophet confused or was he
[1:29:44] trying to tell us
[1:29:46] something the first creation Now the
[1:29:48] first creation wasn't God God is the
[1:29:51] creator
[1:29:52] but in our brain the First Development
[1:29:56] or the word fashion put in there the
[1:29:58] first fashioning of God was that Lo out
[1:30:01] of God comes the logos what something
[1:30:03] that you and I can understand we can
[1:30:06] understand now Microsoft because now
[1:30:08] they have what promoted their product
[1:30:10] they have put a sign on every store they
[1:30:12] have they put a sign on every uh
[1:30:14] computer that they have and you
[1:30:16] understand that that was what that's a
[1:30:18] computer company same way with God God
[1:30:21] when you see the word logos to me that
[1:30:23] explains all of
[1:30:26] God where he come
[1:30:28] from where he's going where he's at and
[1:30:32] what he's doing he's in each one of us
[1:30:34] that that's just to me that and to me
[1:30:36] that makes the Loos simple because when
[1:30:37] I first come back into the message that
[1:30:40] word logos bothered me because I'm like
[1:30:42] they explain it to be this and it's
[1:30:43] speech and it's this but it's a
[1:30:46] man it's
[1:30:48] God stepping out so that we can
[1:30:52] understand
[1:30:53] him condescending so that we as a peanut
[1:30:57] brain group of people can understand a
[1:31:00] God that you can't understand he's put
[1:31:02] his logo or his logos has stepped
[1:31:05] forward and the whole Bible to me to me
[1:31:09] you can see cuz you know you say well I
[1:31:11] don't see Jesus the Flesh in the Old
[1:31:14] Testament the
[1:31:16] flesh you hear but now I see
[1:31:20] MDC who was what the the logos right but
[1:31:23] it was Jesus Christ
[1:31:25] amen but it was Jesus but it wasn't the
[1:31:29] flesh Jesus that man mzc as he stood on
[1:31:32] Earth could not die for your sins right
[1:31:35] but that logos that was in him was the
[1:31:37] same one that gave his life to release
[1:31:41] that because listen I want this is I'm
[1:31:43] going to end it right here the only way
[1:31:46] we can get a
[1:31:47] revelation a true Revelation is to have
[1:31:51] the Revelator in inside of
[1:31:53] us the only way you can get I'm talking
[1:31:56] about a true Revelation sure there's
[1:31:58] things on earth we get a revelation a
[1:32:00] lot of times like I got a revelation I
[1:32:01] couldn't get myself out of that hole the
[1:32:03] other
[1:32:03] day but that was a human Revelation I
[1:32:06] didn't have nothing new with God but it
[1:32:08] but remember it did have something to do
[1:32:10] with God I just didn't see it at the
[1:32:12] time or understand see I didn't see it
[1:32:14] or understand what was going on but the
[1:32:16] logos is which was the son of God that
[1:32:19] shows all the way down
[1:32:22] all the way down even in now in me and
[1:32:26] you he's what the Son of God amen amen
[1:32:31] but the only way the only way brother
[1:32:34] that that you and I can look in the
[1:32:35] Bible and get a revelation or an
[1:32:38] understanding of what it says is because
[1:32:39] that same person that wrote it's inside
[1:32:41] you that's
[1:32:43] right that's right last illustration for
[1:32:46] some of the new ones that had been here
[1:32:48] the last
[1:32:49] illustration I'm going to sit here and
[1:32:51] I'm going to write my life with June for
[1:32:54] 36 years and I'm going to write it all
[1:32:56] down to some of you it'll be the most
[1:32:59] boring piece of literature that you've
[1:33:02] ever
[1:33:03] read but if there some way I could get
[1:33:05] my mind the very person of me right
[1:33:09] listen to this the very person of me
[1:33:12] inside of brother Mark see he just read
[1:33:14] it and go well that's pretty good y'all
[1:33:15] must have pretty good life cuz you did
[1:33:16] this and this and this and this that's
[1:33:17] pretty good thank you see you
[1:33:20] bye but if I can put myself project me
[1:33:24] that would that went through that I went
[1:33:26] through all those words that was written
[1:33:28] that was my experience but if I can put
[1:33:30] me inside brother Mark and then him read
[1:33:33] that and go man I was
[1:33:37] there wouldn't you read it a little
[1:33:39] different same way with that that was
[1:33:43] the word in the beginning was the word
[1:33:45] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:33:47] was God and the Word was now made flesh
[1:33:54] that's why we're under the son of man
[1:33:55] ministering it's the word made flesh in
[1:33:58] me and you today not one person but a
[1:34:01] many membered body we're able to
[1:34:04] understand how we act and how we how
[1:34:06] that God controls us
[1:34:10] amen CU remember if you're born again in
[1:34:13] your soul you're as Eternal as God is
[1:34:16] right why do you need to work on the
[1:34:18] spirit because the spirit's caught
[1:34:20] between here and there right
[1:34:22] right spirit's caught between here and
[1:34:23] there that's why to me the new birth
[1:34:27] births your soul
[1:34:31] amen this right
[1:34:33] here works on your spirit that's right
[1:34:38] amen this works on your spirit cuz
[1:34:41] remember it's either Faith or doubt in
[1:34:42] the soul it's not all these it's either
[1:34:45] Faith or doubt now it comes from down
[1:34:47] there and works its way out but it's got
[1:34:49] to work its way through the spirit and
[1:34:50] the only thing left now is the
[1:34:54] body if you have that if you don't have
[1:34:58] that you still got to work on that
[1:34:59] Spirit realm memory reason conscious
[1:35:01] affection that's where all this comes
[1:35:02] from memory reason conscience affection
[1:35:04] imagination that's why I said the statue
[1:35:06] of perfect man is very important right
[1:35:08] cuz you'll never get clean without it
[1:35:10] sure your Soul's clean sure everything's
[1:35:11] going to be fine but you know what you
[1:35:13] really never
[1:35:15] understand the
[1:35:18] logos because when he walked on the
[1:35:20] earth in a body of flesh he was these
[1:35:24] things he didn't lack any of them and
[1:35:28] now if that word was made flesh back
[1:35:31] then then if you take the word and it
[1:35:33] becomes a part of you then it becomes
[1:35:35] the word made flesh in you amen the word
[1:35:38] made flesh today we can Glory about the
[1:35:41] word made flesh in Jesus's time because
[1:35:43] we know who he
[1:35:46] is but why can't we be the poster child
[1:35:50] sir why can't we be the
[1:35:52] logo like brother Dale was talking about
[1:35:54] this morning the only way you're going
[1:35:55] to know it is on the
[1:35:59] outside that's the only way you're going
[1:36:00] to know it you're only going to know it
[1:36:03] and you know what you can trick somebody
[1:36:04] for a little while amen but you can't
[1:36:06] trick them forever somewhere down the
[1:36:09] line something's going to happen in your
[1:36:10] Humanity if you don't have that logos
[1:36:12] dwelling in your soul there's somewhere
[1:36:15] down the line that is going to be made
[1:36:17] manifest because look the logos is the
[1:36:21] word
[1:36:23] it's the word amen it's all the word not
[1:36:27] 99% of it it's the word and when it's
[1:36:30] made
[1:36:31] flesh it has to express itself it has to
[1:36:37] this is the day of manifestation let's
[1:36:38] stand this is the day of manifestation
[1:36:41] this is the day that you're going to
[1:36:44] either you're going to show your logo
[1:36:46] one way or the other amen is that all
[1:36:49] right that okay we can say say logo
[1:36:52] that's the logo that's the promotion of
[1:36:54] God and and you know what you and
[1:36:57] I we're going to either promote god of
[1:36:59] the devil one of the two amen you're
[1:37:02] going to promote god of the devil one of
[1:37:05] the
[1:37:06] two and if you promote the logos then
[1:37:10] you're going to act just the way the
[1:37:11] logos
[1:37:14] acted
[1:37:15] amen that's
[1:37:19] right our problem is
[1:37:22] preeminence that's our problem our
[1:37:24] problem is preeminence it's that one
[1:37:27] where brother brandham said supposed to
[1:37:29] be led by the Holy Spirit sometimes we
[1:37:32] lead our self and we get self- involved
[1:37:36] and when we get self involved we always
[1:37:38] come up wrong we all just like I did the
[1:37:40] other day I got self involved I got self
[1:37:43] emotions involved in that situation and
[1:37:46] to me it didn't turn out worth a
[1:37:49] flip until I look back I mean people I
[1:37:52] know I was heading down I said man this
[1:37:54] is great 5 minutes I'm I got about to
[1:37:56] that door right there and and I just had
[1:37:59] to stop the lawnmower and I just
[1:38:01] stopped I mean it wasn't like somebody
[1:38:03] physically hit me in the back of the
[1:38:04] head but it was like somebody physically
[1:38:06] hit me in the back of the
[1:38:08] head and said wait a minute what have
[1:38:11] you been preaching what do you preach
[1:38:13] out what do you what do you tell people
[1:38:15] that you're so insignificant but yet if
[1:38:17] somebody changes your tire sister G on
[1:38:19] the side of the road man change your
[1:38:20] tire he may be the biggest whoremonger
[1:38:22] that ever lived on the day of the earth
[1:38:23] and me biggest drunk but on the day of
[1:38:25] judgment God said I'll not forget it
[1:38:28] here and I won't forget it
[1:38:31] there he knows he's done for I mean he
[1:38:34] knows
[1:38:35] it but God thinks so much of sister Gail
[1:38:38] sister Gail's way in the back about 10
[1:38:40] million people behind in the back she
[1:38:42] goes
[1:38:44] Lord he turns around goes
[1:38:47] what remember he changed my tire he said
[1:38:50] I just was waiting for you to say that
[1:38:53] he said enter into the joy of the Lord
[1:38:55] just because of that sister right back
[1:38:56] there so don't think you're
[1:38:58] insignificant if you ever get stuck in a
[1:39:00] hole with a
[1:39:02] lawnmower pray somebody comes by and

[1:42:42] foreheads dressed in rment none but
[1:42:44] Ransom ones can wear Angels can't even
[1:42:48] wear that see even today like we're
[1:42:50] talking about see the Angels they saw
[1:42:53] when God was doing all this cuz he
[1:42:55] created angels first right to to worship
[1:42:58] all right but remember you and I were
[1:43:01] there before the Angels
[1:43:04] were right his children's got to be
[1:43:07] there before the angel amen we just
[1:43:09] weren't there in physical being we were
[1:43:11] there in the mind of God Amen he had
[1:43:13] those thoughts but to develop those
[1:43:15] thoughts he had to bring Angels because
[1:43:17] he was what he was God made him an
[1:43:19] object of worship so the Angels but you
[1:43:23] know what when it come down to where he
[1:43:24] said let there be and then he brought a
[1:43:26] man and then Adam and Eve come forth and
[1:43:29] the angels kind of looked at God and we
[1:43:32] don't understand
[1:43:34] this we don't understand this we don't
[1:43:37] understand what's going on here
[1:43:40] we cuz remember their intent was
[1:43:44] worship worship the Creator they're not
[1:43:47] Sons and Daughters of God they're not an
[1:43:50] offspring of of God so they didn't
[1:43:52] understand a lot of things amen they
[1:43:55] didn't understand they they don't
[1:43:57] understand a Redemption Song Redemption
[1:43:58] they that's not even part of their
[1:44:00] vocabulary
[1:44:01] why they're not Sons and Daughters of
[1:44:04] God we
[1:44:06] fail we
[1:44:08] fail and that's what the rest of that
[1:44:10] quote was in the in the church age book
[1:44:13] sure yeah we were Sons and Daughters of
[1:44:14] God before the foundation of the world
[1:44:16] not his
[1:44:17] people but the attribute now when that
[1:44:20] attribute comes into that logos and that
[1:44:21] logos comes down and comes into you then
[1:44:23] there's that attribute that it was
[1:44:24] before the foundation of the world and
[1:44:27] now you can say I come from God and I go
[1:44:30] back to God any of you that are born
[1:44:32] again you come from God that's what
[1:44:34] where it's where you came from no I come
[1:44:36] from Mom and
[1:44:38] Daddy
[1:44:40] temporarily
[1:44:42] temporarily temporarily just to get you
[1:44:44] down here to make a choice the prophet
[1:44:46] of God said get you here to make your
[1:44:48] choice when I didn't God know what that
[1:44:50] choice was amen didn't knew what that
[1:44:51] choice was but you don't they asked
[1:44:54] brother Brown they said brother Brown
[1:44:55] why you still preaching if all this is
[1:44:56] done and over with like you're saying he
[1:44:58] said I just don't know who's saved and
[1:45:00] who's not you just have to preach like
[1:45:03] they all saved throw the net out there
[1:45:05] you know and you get snakes and spiders
[1:45:06] and sea turtles and all that stuff he
[1:45:08] said but you catch a fish every once in
[1:45:10] a while amen you get a fish and that's
[1:45:12] what we're doing we're looking for that
[1:45:13] last fish I told brother
[1:45:15] Joe Dad read that scripture this morning
[1:45:18] where says Jesus said going to all the
[1:45:20] world and preach the gospel and then
[1:45:21] there's one where it says you know go
[1:45:23] into every uh nation and then the end
[1:45:25] will
[1:45:27] come well hello all we got to do is find
[1:45:31] five more countries to listen to
[1:45:33] us right if there's
[1:45:36] 191 that's already listen you say us I
[1:45:39] mean us the bride there's five of them
[1:45:42] that we got to find and when we do
[1:45:43] brother L we're gone cuz this this went
[1:45:45] to All Nations then there's five nations
[1:45:48] wandering out there somewhere blind but
[1:45:50] we we got to get to the last one you
[1:45:51] love the
[1:45:53] Lord have a safe journey back home I
[1:45:56] hope this has helped you just a little
[1:45:58] bit let's what we're I mean this is just
[1:45:59] a part of what we're doing downstairs
[1:46:01] and uh we haven't got from the logos yet
[1:46:04] have we sister Johnny we're still on the
[1:46:06] L God so we got to get down and keep
[1:46:08] going down and keep going down and we're
[1:46:10] going to break it down all the way down
[1:46:11] to the son of David because I believe
[1:46:13] it's it's important that we understand
[1:46:16] cuz like brother Brown said if you're at
[1:46:17] the bus station waiting on the train
[1:46:20] right what you want to go somewhere but
[1:46:22] you're in the wrong place that's right
[1:46:24] so and and it is good we know what the
[1:46:26] Son of God dispensation was the church a
[1:46:28] dispensation but to take a body change a
[1:46:31] Son of God didn't take a body change Son
[1:46:32] of God don't need a body change I don't
[1:46:34] like to say son of God does not need a
[1:46:35] body change never has that logos never
[1:46:39] needed a body change that was a
[1:46:41] supernatural body but now the son of man
[1:46:43] is the one that took the body changed so
[1:46:45] we've got to understand that son of man
[1:46:47] Revelation in order for our body to be
[1:46:49] changed so see without the son of man
[1:46:52] revelation we can't take a body change
[1:46:54] that's and look this is just this is the
[1:46:57] Son of God
[1:46:58] Revelation this is not the son of
[1:47:01] man Peter James and John preach this to
[1:47:04] hear that's the son of man Revelation
[1:47:06] they did not understand who that man
[1:47:08] Jesus was right and they will not
