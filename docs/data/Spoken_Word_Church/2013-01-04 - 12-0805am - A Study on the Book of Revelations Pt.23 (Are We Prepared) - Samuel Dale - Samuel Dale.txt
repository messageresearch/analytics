be with them maybe they're watching this morning by services and all we just ask you to help each one we love you and we thank you we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen amen Revelations 1 says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to sh unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy see and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand the time to understand right right all right 1 Peter 1 ver9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you right searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified before him the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed now see it was revealed to them that they it wasn't to them all right unto whom it was revealed that unto that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them which have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you when at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated did the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I know we have the thing to do but you're going in and out we pull it in and out something y we I chose today to uh run off the copies for you in our will the Lord's willing this afternoon um because I I've I've been thinking a lot on this trying to get up to a place to speak what the Lord willing we get there this afternoon we we be trying to to speak upon him and uh you know in that way the Lord is is good to us and he opened more of a better way uh one day there while brother Donnie and I were talking and fellowshipping and during the time being there maybe a a way of presenting something that I've had on my heart that I wanted to bring to you but basically what I want to do this morning I want to give you these or you can go home and if you'll follow it and just go down the line 1 2 3 4 then you you will you know the numbers on the quotes I'm giving you you will um I hope get an understanding these quotes have been given unto you uh the last service I preached I preached a lot about this but I want to make sure you understand this because what I have upon my heart would be no need of trying to progress further if you don't understand up to the point of what we're we've been trying to bring about the Book of Revelation so you know just bear with me and and and and everything Paul said it didn't bother him to say things twice so I guess it don't bother me to say I'm about 8,432 cuz that's probably about how many times I've said this and you know and been talking but I want to get it to a place that we can see so I just asked the question you know brother random said chapter 5 of Revelation Was preparing for the opening of the Seven Seals all right then I'm asking the question this morning basically are we prepared to understand are we prepared now you know it what no Hy Hazard thing that John was taken to patmas I saw that while uh brother seran and I really enjoyed his message but I was following his message along there Wednesday night and I saw something that you know I thought well I need to express that a little you know it wasn't no halfhazard thing that John was the one picked to go to patas even if you take the uh Gospel of Matthew Mark Luke and John you know the combat Beast and the things that brother Brandon would refer to and he would say you know like Matthew was the the line Mark the ox uh you know Luke the man and John the eagle and he was more into the prophetic form and he was chosen now so there had to be certain qualifications why did not God wait until PA came on the scene even to bring about the Book of Revelations that could have easily been done but it was for the point that it had to be a specific person all right now that you know that went to Pats all right the specific purpose or person who went there and then to see that there must be as we covered in one service there or spoke a few times about it it takes a special people to understand this book of Revelations brother R said it couldn't be done in Luther's age Wesley's age or the Pentecostal age It could only be understood in this age so it would have to be special people who would be prepared to uh you know to do and I'm not throwing no stones or making LI or jokes I'm just saying it um some trinitarian wouldn't it have been something to send a trinitarian Believer to patmas to write the Book of Revelations now we know it wouldn't have been done you know I mean but I'm just making a point by that to dig into your mind a little so that you'll think on it it had to be a specific person who had a an understanding all right and see then you and I must have the understanding that's right see we're the people then there's not another people to come amen all right we've never said you know time's over with or anything like that uh you know we tried to make it as right as we can but I believe we're the end time people I believe we're the people that it says it's time to understand yes all right and then in doing that I want us to make sure that we get the right foundation because uh wouldn't it be something to take somebody that would say uh you know uh that have a a degree in electronics and uh I said well we're going to have a good speaker this afternoon said we've got a choice of having a person who has a degree in electronics or or you can have your choice of whether you want him to speak or Einstein now what kind of a choice would it be you know all right and see that was what God was doing he had all of the Apostles and things that he could have taken Peter was a great one he opened the doors to the kingdom see all of those were but John was special and even in his life he was special he was the young one that leaned upon the the bosom of the Lord you know he was the young one that was always close with him it was always when like a healing would take place John would always be there see because he was special all right now then I believe you know you and I are special people amen I don't mean just Lula Georgia I'm not talking junk I'm talking to the world if they'll listen to it of whatever is out there you know that can and uh I do know for sure that that this message is going into a lot of foreign countries it's not like brother Lincoln Barner said one time they had a little radio station up there and said he probably reach out about 20 miles you know so this preacher gets on the radio and he says hello world they only go out 20 miles but we do know this goes out a whole lot fun the 20 M but every who's supposed to hear will hear and receive and you know in appreciate it appreciate these brothers for doing all of that to getting it ready but now we spent a lot of time reading and talking of chapter 4 and then we went in and started in chapter 5 and we spent a lot of time up to verse 7 now this afternoon we will pick up the Lord willing on verse 8 and we will try to continue you know our thought but I want to make sure you understand as I said the prophet said this was a preparation for the opening of The Seven Seals All right now he said we must get the preparation correct oh yeah right okay what do you mean brother Dale seals broke long time ago yeah that's what people say but how they broke to you and I amen right amen the sealed is the revelation of Jesus Christ not the Antichrist we'll get on that this afternoon so then has Christ been revealed to you or is your Christ brother Brandon there's a brother man sends me books every once in a while and he's named his children Christ brother Christ brandom so and so you know and that's what he believes he he you know their deities and things and we certainly don't believe that but we believe that the Lord Jesus Christ did use a man to bring us a message that's what we believe that's all we try to bring if if you was a presbyterian you didn't want to go after whoever you wanted or whatever or Methodist Baptist or Lutheran but now think of it now we've talked a lot about that no man was worthy to take the book all right so then it's not a the lamb wasn't a animal you know it couldn't take the book all right and we'll get back to it after a while of this what this lamb looks like but the main thing I want us to take is brother uh Anderson go ahead and pull up Revelations 5 and I want us to just think a little bit you say well we've been over this and over this we do it if you want to get up and go home you're welcome I'll go over it again whether you're here or whether you're not okay right that's just the best way of saying it you know you got your choice you got your keys in your pocket not trying to run nobody off just be blunt right amen and just plain about it but what it says and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals that's right now you really understand these are symbolics you know a throne you're not looking at a throne the throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is living in your heart all right I hope that's caught on right all right and we know the right hand is the power and authority of almighty God that's right not one sitting on the right hand right you know the power and authority that's right and then we got down and spent quite a time dealing with this book that was in the hand of the one on the throne and uh it's not a scoffield or Thompson Chain or anything amen it's not a book like we talk about because back then they didn't have books right when it was translated into the King James it was brought over because they were beginning to pick up words and things and using the word book all right but it was originally we went through that it was some Scrolls MH that were written all right but yet we went through to seeing that this book in the hand of the one on the throne was the book that was actually placed before Adam Y and you know but yet because of the Fall then the book went back to the hand of the original owner amen and brother R said we see him on the throne with that book and he's the holder of the book of life right all right now you can pull these up brother Joe would have Scan through him in a hurry but go ahead with number one we'll drop back to this in a minute but holding it to the point around and said who is this who is this and what's going on you know so we see we know it was God sitting on the throne right all right then we see that the book he said he's the absolutely the absolutely original holder of The Book of Life right he holds it God does it when Adam forfeited it went back to its original owner it belongs to him and John is in the vision here in season all right now what kind of a book is it we said it's not something like that we even would cover it as a scroll right the it's the book of life amen right all right The Book of Life all right and then we went through covering these things to be able to see it that this book go ahead to number two and Christ is identified the same he's talking about it that he cannot come until the last one that has the name of the book of life y that was put there before the foundation world but that name is called that's the last one then M he came to redeem to bring back redeem is to bring back and when he brings the life one in he is sitting at the right hand of God tonight doing his mediatorial work now notice this is 64 after the seals broke yeah right see he's talking of him sitting on the throne doing his mediator work when the light my soul is saved and that was that was redeemed and seen and knowed by God before the foundational world when that life soul is saved that closes the book right amen M then the lamb comes out takes a book out of the right hand of him that sits upon the throne and then he's coming to Earth he's coming to make it known right all right now we spend a little time emphasizing that this book see that was 1964 right you say well the prophet took the book all this happened in ' 63 why in' 64 is he talking still of mediatorial and why would he be saying don't you say that I say redemption's over don't you say the lamb has left The Mercy Seat amen he said I never said that right all right so if he never said that then he never said that that's the best way of putting it right he didn't say it see we say well now we got this with but he said it right you know so the emphasis whether or not we believe what he said now remember I spent quite a time talking about that the book must be completed that's right before it can be taken right amen all right now until the last name which we're reading here m would come into the book of life and we know it was written before the foundation of the world so we're not worried about it but we're talking about when that name is revealed upon Earth or person comes upon Earth and salvation comes to that person correct amen is what you're talking about because it was written before the foundation of the world all right and being that doing you're going to have to wait until all those names comes in and all are saved then redemption's over right that's correct and that's I kept asking you the question there one day do you believe redemption's over do you believe that in 1963 the lamb left The Mercy Seat as people are teaching and that was the first doctrine that struck me when I came into message in ' 67 was that Redemption was over in 63 cuz the lamb had left The Mercy Seat well then none of us basically in the building would be saved today right amen so I think we don't believe that amen right am so I think we can just move over from that and let all of this fanaticism fall away and and not worry about it all right amen then we can go on over to go number three first brother Joe before we get I mean Brother Anderson before we had a wonderful time last night yeah we if you want to listen to that brother Joe's got it and he can break it down you know and put it on to a tap we had a jubilee time I thought that was going to be the hardest borest aggravating this uh questions and answers form we was going to ever have go we had it about what is your name and people brought what their name where the meaning of their name right you know and I didn't have to worry about it because see weit just took care of it yeah cuz I said whatever he is I'm two times at it I said so I don't have to tell you what my name is but I enjoyed hearing people talk about their names and things it was really great all right and you say well was it boring to just hear people no it was great it was good but then we got down to the end and I told them in the middle I said now I'm reserving my part until the end so I want you to each one give your name and the meanings Etc and then we went through that we all got a new name right amen we're Christians amen hallelujah we all got to you know we got to going through then the the numerical numbers or what you call it chronological orders or numerical numbers and what your name means and your number you're born under Etc and I told him a little kid you there I said brother random told a brother one time said you was born under like a four and said but your new birth put you under a too and said you're going to fight your nature all of your life right well you know the new bird puts us all under one number right amen and under one name and under one zodiac right right right and it's not just Aries no that's right lamb you know the lamb we're all under that by the new birth right then we have to fight sure your zodiac form controls these things out here your body we're controlled by the I was watching it down there how the tide would go out and come in and you know just watch those things it's beautiful but we really had a great time when we finished so if you'd like to listen to it might encourage you to come amen all right but number three what kind of a book is this to begin with there is no basis for the claimers in Sardinian Church age 267 and I gave you these quotes So if you want to read them off of that or read them up here CLS that the L book of life is not the same as the Book of Life The Book of Life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's Book of Life and even thy book or book of the living only names are written in it Revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names are not written in the L in the book of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world all right now if you look on the back of your last notes that was given you will see drop back now brother to to to a and just remember this is only a book of names the one in the hand of the one on the throne if you look back and flop on the back of it you'll find this quotation there are only names written in the Lamb's Book of Life there's not anything about your life right there's not anything in the Lamb's Book of Life the one that that go God had in his hand back there that went back from Adam was a book of names right amen all right and there was no records CU we hadn't come down and made a record yet that's right that's right all right it wasn't the records made amen it was a book of names right but then when it come to Earth you begin what would be known as writing of the Bible and it would bring it down to listen to what he's saying this is works of Faith Express paragraph 119 just like last night speaking when you get the book you're going to be maybe a little confused he talking about the church age book listen but one of them is your natural birth is what I said the two books of life it's the same book but one of them is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth one leads out to the other one all right now you got a couple of quotes up above there that will will go with that and you're reading off your notes that the Bible is two books it's the book of life right but it's divided into two books part of the Bible is the record of your natural life right right and the living on the earth and records and things are kept genealogies and things right but the other part of that is the re of Jesus Christ right amen which is where your name is written in the lounge book of life amen all right see then now we can read both of the parts of the book or sections or whatever you want to call it right amen we can read it here we can read about a Peter and a Paul and a James and a John and you know 4 and Luke 1730s and all of that and then now we've gotten to the point I hope by the study of the Book of Revelation we can see that our names are WR right that's right and it's not his brother Bram said it's not our manev it's what's going on while he's alive so that puts his name in the book all right so then we have the right setting the book that was there is not a it's not a Bible yeah right but where R will call it the Bible sure there not two two books but yet he say there's two books or two parts of the same book right one of them is your Eternal section the other one is your natural life amen all right one leads out to the other one right yes right but see then we must come to Earth Yep and there would have to be a book started about our lives amen you know so we start in Genesis and come down through and you know come down to our day and time and uh when it would then it would be a book but before the lamb can take the book I want to keep rolling that in your mind the book has got to be completed right amen because now here's what everybody argues about you know it's been an argument in the message ever since I've been in it that the seals are the seventh seals broke other side say s still ain't broke Y and some says well it's partially broke you know so they trying to get an in between I guess right but they never talk about how the book got sealed right this is a seal book sure brother randam even said we didn't know that no do you need that quote he said we didn't know that we didn't know it was a sealed book but we always been able well you mean sealed up well I've been able to read all my life ain't nothing sealed around my Bible bless God the Lord Jesus came into my heart and open the book brother said when the seals come off the book it become a brand new book does it come off to you right yes well yes I see this I see that and I see it's okay for me to have four or five wives that's what a lot of them say that don't fit the old book no that's right right right right truly don't come in the new book the new book can't be something different from the old all right it's just more revealed all right but how did the book get sealed we went through a message back there talking about how that when the children of Israel was going into captivity they would take the um property Deeds Etc what we would call now the the the tracks of land that they had added the descriptions and they put it in an Earthly vessel bury it in the ground that's in Jeremiah then and see then bringing it over until those all it was supposed to be was still in Jesus Christ amen right right but people don't even talk about a sealed book they don't like that right even the ones that says it sealed they say it's open to a degree or they say it's open six seals it open yeah uh but the seventh is not open you know they've been arguing that ever since they've been in the message right but you don't hear anybody talking about how the book got sealed the book I hope you caught it in a message or two back when I preached over and over that the book has got to be complete before it can be sealed right you don't seal a partially partial book so whenever name that would ever be in the book of life you know the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world when it's manifest on Earth and comes into the Plan of Redemption and if there's one today that's not in that Plan of Redemption the book is not sealed right M right come on M it's not sealed until the last name is brought in the book it's sealed then yes see when you get the new birth you're sealed in amen the body of Christ amen that's right you agree right amen but as we were talking about last night a little bit about it but I'm we going to have the next one on like justification and things but if you're not born again you're not sealed in the body of Christ that's right and folks that's our problem we're still an open book right until the new birth comes right amen that's our trouble that's why we live on both sides of the pages right amen you you know what I'm saying right that's right but when the book is sealed and only then can the lamb take the book that's right he said but but brother Dale the the lamb took the book 2,000 years ago Redemption was over 2,000 years ago now where you at well no the lamb took a book 63 well then Redemption was over in 63 and that would leave us out right I'm not hateful it's just time to rub out a little make belief that's or unbelief that's in us that we think we know right thereby we don't have to listen to nobody because we know am that's right I asked a brother when he was fixing to leave here I said would you do me a favor and yourself I said I'm going to preach something this afternoon that you don't know was it upsetting he said you don't think I know it I said I know you don't no problem sure would you please stay this afternoon and listen I ask you to please come back this afternoon of course some of you won't so thereby you'll be showing you don't care yeah that's right okay forget all of that time to rub out unbelief amen that's right all right go ahead now so the prophets are the one that said it I didn't go to number four Brother Anderson I went number three I guess went that that one but you know only n are in the book now number four what the prophet say this is taken from the fourth seal 63 321 now we have noticed now that the breaking of the seal it's the sealed book of redemption right and then the book is rolled up like a scroll just like the old was was a book it wasn't a book of this type you know and all like that that's doing it but it's a seven sealed book of redemption right now this book you see yeah but we've been able to read all of these we we can read about these things Brother D yeah come on the prophet of God in the seal book after he preached six seals he said if God doesn't come paraphrasing it now now and open this seven seal he said we're only presuming right amen you need that quote so now think about it the book is sealed it's a sealed book go to number five this is the breach paragraph 68 do these things that please God where the book is sealed now and you are sealed amen the holy spirit is the seal y amen P the next one number six taken from the breach paragraph 75 now notice this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book mhm until the day of redemption am right you're seal with the book so then it's a simple matter of realizing that the book was sealed we were allowed to read certain things and the apostles were and the great faith of the fathers was there and they lived it and manifested it but yet a great man that is in the faith of the fathers by the name Paul he said without this end time people yep I'm I paraphrasing it we're not going to be made perfect right amen without us you canot be made perfect that's right he went into the ground and now he's depending on us amen that's right why not wait until Redemption over to try to understand a lot of things but you're sealed with the book and remember the emphasis I kept making that you can't take the book until it's fully right done it's got to be written right then you can take the book that's right and reveal the seal that's right well I don't understand when in the world you're saying it's right cuz you don't have a background and I'm sorry 40 years I've tried yes but you that connecting on and you're hearing these you're hearing things said that you say what in the world is a man talking about but for 40 years standing here declaring that the seals is not to the Bride of Jesus Christ the physical things of them the revelation of the seals is to the bride the seals are to Israel you see that's takes a lot of thinking but you see folks I've tried my best to express it to you look at number seven what are we and what are we doing Christ M God reveal paragraph 5:24 now you see the seals and this is after the seals are broke now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book book would be him and all that's in that excuse me all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he come forth to this for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book for the foundation world when it was slain as a lamb right I tried to preach a point and I don't I'm just going to say this and block it and go back to the message you and I are that book yes right that goes to Israel abely it be a complete book without it us am all right get to to that this afternoon you'll see the importance of this that I've tried to say to you see the book of names or the Lamb's Book of Life is the names of those who are to be redeemed that was what was in the hand of the one on the throne right was the name of the people that would be redeemed and only the bride is written there amen that's right the foolish virgins and things are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life section of eternal life right right they are in the Book of Life yeah the sections that are not Eternal that you can have it your name in the book and then have it removed that's right if you don't go on the father holds that name that book of names in his right hand sitting on the throne the father that's almighty God you say not it's a son it was the lamb it was this this stated right God sitting on the throne right and he's holding that name of books I'm book of names I can't get backwards waiting until that life's name appears on Earth and comes to Redemptive form right and until then he's writing a book about you and I right amen sure called The Book of Life the section of the Bible right the Bible is still being written sure amen if you're thinking that your name is in the book and you're not born again today then the book is not written completed yet your name's not in there right see you got to wait until all the names are in before you can take the book amen right you'd be taking the book premature right amen see then there's no way in the world you to understand how that we are the actual word amen right you and I are the actual word amen we are the as Paul called written epistle read and known of all man right and those two witnesses will stand there and point back over here to where we are amen and they you know doing to where we were let me get it where nobody won't misunderstand the word going back to where we were and they'll say see you missed your salvation right amen but those Gentiles receive that salvation right amen and they've gone in a Rapture right that's right and you'll never have sunship you'll be servants right see the father sitting on the throne because it's the father strong amen right oh that's simple language is it right amen the Father Strong is where the father sitting right all right but in his imorph his form that is shown in the book he shown as a lamb I gave you a couple of them and it's in the back of your your notes where the prophet of God said he climbed up on the throne he took the book climbed up on the throne and sat down just because he took he can't take the book until the light's name appears right but then when he does he climbs up on the throne and sits down the prophet said it's an amorphus of God right right yes the forms of God being made known amen right all right and doing that then who's sitting on the throne according to acts 7 I think it's 69 I wrote These didn't read it Steven looked up and he saw Jesus standing on the right hand of God all by Revelation in Hebrews speaks of how that when he ascended he went to the right hand right mhm the power and the authority not the right hand right right join then on patmas sees in Revelations 51 him sitting on the throne right with the book in his hand getting prepared for the opening all right well then when you get to it you see the elders and all as they gather around and chapter 5 and things are taking place and when you do see those things you remember that the proclamation went out and the Elder said the line of the tribe of Judah right has prevailed to take the book in other words in Lo the seals John was looking for that line because he knew who that was right he knew what tribe Jesus came from which was the line of the tribe of Judah the Bible saying that a lawgiver would come from Judah remember Judah was not mentioned in the bible as to come like a Levites it looked like that Jesus would have come from the tribe of Levi don't it yeah cuz that would have been the priesthood but in instead of that he came from the line of the tribe of Judah and as he did John knew that right so he's turning to look and when he does he sees a lamb amen yes now if that's all he would have seen John would have been all right because he could have said look I remember when he was introduced on the River Jordan not as the line of the tribe of Judah but as the Lamb of God that would take away the sin of the world that's right he says everything's okay but he looks and he sees him yeah the funny looking lamb cuz he got seven horns and seven eyes right so he needs help to be able to understand all right the lamb then can come forth The Lion and the lamb is the same God but different forms Mor right amen he will not be the line until Redemption is over right amen but when it is over he will become the lamb right he will remain as the lamb to Israel after redemption's over for us right but to us he becomes the line I don't want to get that far he becomes our husband right amen all right the line but where did that lamb come from is what was bothering John yeah for surely if he had seven horns and seven eyes it would in symbolics as he was being there and understanding those things he would know surely that that would have some connection right to where this lamb would have been and what he had been doing now remember it doesn't describe of Paul or Steven when they saw Jesus standing at the right hand right it doesn't describe him as a lamb right right they describe him as a person right yeah that's right come on Sten saw him Paul spoke of him right but here John he he wonders about this lamb and when he does he says where did this lamb come from cuz I remember what happened I remember he was introduced to the lamb and I remember what took place what was this that took place that made this come to the to the right position going number eight now on the mighty conqueror 1958 I go about Welcome Home the angels and the Bly gates open up and Jesus right down through the streets of Glory with the Old Testament Saints behind him seeing where was this at his resurrection right right and ascension all hell the fire of Jesus name and he come up in the fr front of the father's strong and said father here they are they were Faithful over a few things he said get up here son and sit on the right hand until I make all thy folds thy foot stool there he stands tonight okay but there still no l right there's still no land with seven horns and seven eyes right but when he sees him in Revelation he sees him as that where did he come from go ahead number nine I said most of these you've had over and over and over you ought to be able to quote them without this is Tak them to the breach now where it came forth where did it come from it come from the Father Strong they talking about the lamb the whatever John mentioned in Heavens looking where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised up he raised up and set on the right hand of God ever making ever living to make intercessions amen raised the Earth today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people now and that's the one I'm depending on he still there covered with bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sin all right where's they at Father Strong right go to the next one so if this lamb come from anywhere he come from the father is strong from the breach paragraph 199 Notice come from the Father Strong oh think where did he advance from to this Vision he come from Glory where he's seated at the right hand of God he Advanced forth to John out of Glory the lamb coming forth look at the next now he ties Zechariah 4 and Zechariah 4 is tying together about zerubabel and the Seven eyes of the Lord now watch brother Brown the seven eyes this is the breach paragraph 236 eyes means seeing seeing means Prophet seers this lamb had seven horns and on each horn had an eye seven eyes what is it Christ and his bride seven Church ages out of there with seven prophets that went forth seven Sears eyes so the last one must be a sear what is it Christ and his bride right amen you realize then folks that what I preached for years to you of one thing you can talk about the birth of the word that's wonderful you can talk about being pregnated with the word and that's great we need that yes but when are you going to ever get down to talking like Masterpiece and she's not out the shook when brother randam actually emphatically States He said Mary was not the seed amen he said she was a carrier he said because he was deceived amen see Mary gave birth to the seed Zeus zeusa Street Pentecost gave birth to the word right Christ Is that real word you and I are going to have to be the word not just talk about a birth that's right where's the lamb going to come from to be able to take the book right amen I didn't say it's your Prophet said that's the bride yes M but Brother D you saying we going to be the one that takes the book now I didn't tell that and ain't never talked that right right amen if you thought I did you missed it that's right the lamb is the one that will take the book but the lamb must be produced by the Bride of Jesus Christ and to do that she must become the word amen the bride must not only give birth to the word but must be able to bring forth a fully matured lamb right amen statue of perfect man right whatever you want to talk about so in our revelation we must see him totally restored that's right back to seeing him sitting on the throne with a book in his hand and in doing that seeing that he paid the price the way he got to that Throne we read the quote climb up here and sit down you paid the price Jesus Christ paid the price for our salvation but see we're in the end time you and I must be the book amen that is in the hand of the one sitting on the throne amen right why would we want to B to the garbage cans of thinking that we might be able to take a book or S no now let's just become the book right amen amen y it's not our job to be the lamb amen but we are so closely connected to the lamb until the lamb had the horns on him and had the eyes amen you can't separate him and her right do you see by Revelation as Jesus Christ climbed up on your throne that's it and sat down in your heart right and become the one in your throne right right see is our responsibility to give birth to the lamb right and bring it into maturity right can not be the lamb right amen it's all in him page 45 u in right on the son said he is those seals he is those seals it's not being you but where is he at he's got to have a form to Reve feel himself through right cuz he in glory we're not going to glory and see these things right but he's bringing it in a form called The Bride right well I just can't believe that well good you're headed to the Grave y right but don't worry about it we'll get you up I've never preached nobody into hell or nowhere's else right but I've always tried to tell the truth I said it 30 something years ago I said the biggest portion of people of this message will die and go by the grave I've said that probably 5,432 times ever since then and maybe a few more because most people do not know what in the world's going on that's right they do not know the age in the time all we know brother brother was a prophet yeah I thought brother renam come to introduce the bride right to Jesus Christ amen see we're not the lamb folks get it out of your mind but we must birth the lamb let the lamb IM morphy through US amen and come to that place amen amen remember the book cannot be taken until the book is completed right right we saw then that the the book is the Believers we are the Believers that's in the book right and we are the book that's going to go to Israel right amen a living revealed word is going to go to Israel one day amen you remember when we got into these go ahead to number 12 I may have jumped something if I did forgive me you have the writings look what your Prophet call us you say but we cannot be this we cannot do this that you're talking about to be the word that we would actually be I'm not talking about just giving birth to the word right amen ausa Street Pentecost gave birth to the word right Mary gave birth to the word but your Prophet own the message I gave you Masterpiece see not out a shut he said there's one more stage right one more thing got to take place somebody's got be the word here you said well brother Brandon was at now then wonderful I'm glad you thought of that but remember John was not the Bride come on now listen to my wording right he was a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ but he was not the full bride when he went up right he only Ted that's right brother around said what you see now one day you will see it in its fullness what amen you mean the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to have the same Ministry that brother randam had amen the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world not no one person no more not no Lula Georgia but around the world that's right the Bride of Jesus Christ will have the same Ministry that brother rown had which will be the same Ministry the Lord Jesus Christ had brother R said if not then won't welcome back that's right come on he can't come to it if it's not his same ministry right come on Church listen so what did he say you know we just kind of pass it off all God was he put in Christ all Christ in the church we just kind of passed that off as a good quote do we really believe it right adoption 1965 22 185 well then all that God was he poured into Jesus for he was the fullness of the godhead bodily is that right is it right he was God that's right all right is that right and all that Jesus was he poured into the church these things that I do shall you do all things of even greater than this shall you do where I go to the Father which is his body the fullness of him that fth all in all go ahead to the next this is Page paragraph 159 Christ of Myster God revealed preach 1963 7208 God expressed in Jesus who was both Father Son and Holy Ghost right the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church the Believers right a big man in this message he said you you say that you we that and he said you okay he brother rather said it sure you going get mad at me I found it you you would get upset with me cuz I found what the prophet said get upset with the prophet cuz he said it come on get the next one page 14 or paragraph excuse me number 14 paragra 130 the Mighty God unable then it was God in them days it was God in a man his son Jesus Christ we believe that amen now if you don't believe the rest of it you don't believe that that's right can I stop and say that you don't believe that if you don't believe the rest of it not just a prophet not just an ordinary man ordinary human it was God in Christ God in a man the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man God in in a man now it's God in men the fullness of the godhead bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word now do you believe that amen what about the light I think it is maybe one more progress 17 of lean not to to th own understanding so you see if you were in the full knowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God right and the only way you can be a Son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God that's talk about your new birth right right and God isn't complete without you amen that's right come on that'll make you feel good has to be that's right because there's there is one only one resource of eternal life and that is God and him alone has eternal life now and you were part of him in so much that you are an attribute are in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug towards him that's what has to be quickened some of them will never be quickened they just don't have that's wrong God is not complete right amen without you but here's the key let's is the last one God's only provided place of worship 1965 11:28 paragraph 264 no leav among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily y Le is our own ideas and thoughts right so when we get rid of all of that the fullness will be here said he couldn't do it the days couldn't do it in Luther's age no couldn't do it in W's age couldn't do it in Pentecostal age no but the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people am everybody else said in brother showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on Earth in the form of a prophet God Oh Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scripture where you worship at in the house of God SE present tent right you see what he's talking about yes yes but brother Dale we we don't see the things that was going on with the prophet what about it mhm right when Tyler got stung the other day he was in bad shape right he was itching all over and everything I just simply waited not because of no thing of Donnie and Bill not being in but I waited till I caught him in the bathroom coming out and tler we need to pray reached down and took his hands I'd say his temperature at that time was drastically over 103 or4 he was burning hot burning hot and I could feel it we prayed and then and little bumps was coming up all along like where his blood was running especially all through here and night this little wels was coming up all over him and we prayed Paul found out and got Bill knew where the doctor was we went over Tyler sitting there he said brother Donnie had to go back and get some paperwork and some stuff from you know his billfold Etc Tyler he said brother Dale said call will just call Papa will just walk down here to Publix and get some you know some Dramamine or I mean know what been benad and said called I'm doing fine I said no no let's don't do it I believed he was healed but I said let's don't do it let's let us the doctor well we have a lot of fun about the doctor giving in shots and things you know but you see church I believe that God is still alive he's waiting on the Bride of Jesus to realize who she is the prophet said what you're here for if we're the fullness of the godhead bodily you say well I just can't see that well then you're blinded right come on you're blinded amen blind language you're blind the prophet said it you know there's a favorite quote of that right Prophet said it and I believe it and that's it that's a favorite quote I like it this way the prophet said it and I believe it and I've seen it made manifest cuz I've seen a living God in the reality of a people but to make sure you understand there is no book to go to Israel no tell me where it's coming from that's right right amen yes sir where's the book it's going to Israel I want scripture I know where I'm standing I know scripture where's the book that's going to Israel if it's not the Bride of Jesus Christ show me some verse paragraph Etc whatever right and we're not going over there like a man told me he said oh them two prophets this is years ago he said them two prophets said that'll be a gentile bride and a gentile prophet of course yeah we knew that he was saying he was the Gentile prophet and I told him I said brother randam said it would be two Jews because the the Jews wouldn't have a gentile that's right now don't go play games with me Elijah in his natural First Estate was a gentile in brother brandom it would have been a gentile but when he goes to Israel your Prophet said they won't accept nothing but a Jew right so that Elijah is going to be a Jew amen of course the brother didn't like it but I was just telling him what I believe just like I try to tell you what I believe I believe you and I have got to be the Living Word right amen right not just talk about it that's right but be the Living Word that's right could God take your Revelation and go to through with it God that's right you see why brother Ram couldn't go right come on he was on a plane the video they got of him they were setting up for him to go to Israel said brother Brandon with your ministry them Jews will accept Jesus Christ he was on the plane going there landed in what CYO or something and the Lord said come on behind the hanger I need to talk to you right he said iniquity of the is not full yet and said you can't go but he said I always thought I'd have something to do with Israel coming to Christ and you know he will yes sir CU it'll be his message that will go to Israel that's right sir and we're supposed to be that message that man said you don't think it'd be a gentile prophet and a gentile bride no sir you believe it I wouldn't have CED if he said we'll make you the prophet and we'll just get you a gentile bride I have said it won't work I got to be a Jew amen that's right because they won't accept nothing else that's right see church we got to be that book not just talk about it not just read it but we've got to become that book and then there'll be a book that's right to go to Israel brother random made a hor said I'd have made a horrible mistake y first seal if God hadn't to come and straighten me out of that's right what do you think would would have happened now this is this evening's message but what do you think would have happened in chapter 5 when they asked brother randam that question and they said is this the saints of God and he said no this is not the redeemed I'm reading him he started on and he stopped and he said something's wrong brother Ned Allison from my understanding was one that told him said read your question and your scripture over he read it over and he said that's wrong y he said see that's the bride now why would he why would he say to start with that was not to Bri y why would he say it was not the bride y he's a prophet you got to have a reason is because of what he had taught yep was he standing on it y be church it's time to wake up and start believe it if that wasn't the Bride of what he thought now he thought it wasn't the bride because he said it he said this is not the bride this not the Saints he said this is not the redeemed right then who was he thinking it was M hold that and that would have messed the Bible up entirely right yes sir now one more statement he said if we don't get this Daniel 70 weeks straight y he said we can't exactly Place The Book of Revelation right that's righty stand come on you got to have it prepared that's right he said we've got to get it prepared he said then if we get it pred we can depend on God to come and open it that's right sir cuz you know what he would have been to it he was saying that Israel that's right he be trying to show Israel to Israel y right won't work work if he showed Israel to Israel it would have made him sunship y right right if he showed Israel to Israel it would made him sunship CU he's not trying to show Israel to me and you he's trying to show us to ourselves that we can be the sons and daughters he would have made Israel back his sunship y I don't tell everything just what I need to take all right because I have to wait go ahead what do we got anybody have a need we got 142 inp than on these oh the light of the world life and mercy in his name Jesus the of the world we walk in the sh all
