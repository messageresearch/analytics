in Ephesians now remember the uh ministers meeting will be this coming Saturday the Lord willing wait and I'll be traveling over to uh brother J Hughes for the ministers meeting and then coming back and then way got to go preach for brother Burley for the weekend on the Sunday so just remember that and also remember now the fellowship meeting will be not just coming Saturday but the next Saturday and brother forny will be with us preaching for the weekend so keep those things in mind uh the announcements and things that the Lord would bless each one any other announcements I generally miss something but just pray one for another all right our heavenly father we thank you tonight for an opportunity to be able to come out yes to be able to gather together with people of light precious faith and just to talk about you a little a little bit and Lord and let you come on the scene Among Us and manifest yourself cuz you promised that anywhere two or three would be gathered in your name that you would be there so we're dependent upon that we believe we've gathered for that one purpose not to be seen or just to have a place to go but to be to the word that we could hear from you and we are asking that you bless each one bless those that are here and those that are not able to be here and just let your love be with each and every one forgive our sins cuz we want to be covered by the blood lead us now as we speak about you in Jesus name amen Ephesians one that we're going to read them down to about the 11th verse tonight but we'll start the third verse through to the 11th verse blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein Heath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own own will you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word and I read on down to the 10th verse because we'll get to that after a while you know I've heard people in the message say that especially one man said that he didn't believe in dispensations well you know the prophet said you'd be messed up in the Bible if you didn't believe in dispensations now you you would really get confused and we'll read one after a while and and you know but that says th are the dispensation of the fullness of times and you know the prophet said that there was a dispensation of the law there was a dispensation of this there was a dispensation of that and he said and there's a dispensation of adoption all right so then that's the time that we're living in is this hour so we'll get to that the Lord willing on as we go along now what do we've been talking about it said we've been talking about adoption adoption is to to adopt someone into your family and you know bringing them into uh your line or inheritance or lineage or whatever you want to call it and you know in doing that see then that's our natural words of adoption but in the Bible terminologies the children of Israel the the right of adoption was in the bases that the child was born a son of into the family you know a child and then they came to a place of the tutoring or training to where that they could be adopted into the family and we're bringing that and trying to to look at it you know from the scriptural point but trying to make it just as simple as we can and and talk about about it is as much as we can get into you know and and not try to run off everybody wants to talk about this and that on adoption but to me I believe we need to just you know kind of slow down and and think about the things that we're talking about because see you and I were alienated as we covered in the last message we were we were away from God we had no hes we were Gentiles we had no lineage rights we had nothing the the uh adoption really the scriptures says that it was pertaining to Israel you know because they had the right of sunship that's right but when they turned down that right of sunship and we as Gentiles accepted the right see then that would make us the children of God all right now as one firm believer I believe that we must be born again Amen to be a child of God I don't believe I told you last Wednesday everybody in the world is a child of God by natural creation that's right it don't matter who it is Adolf Hitler who the good or the bad it doesn't matter every person is a child of God by natural creation all right but that was not what Nicodemus was talking to Jesus about when he had heard him speak about the kingdom and and all and and all and that was not what he was doing so Jesus said you must be born again in other words that's like I've told you that there's a lot more was said than what's written in the Bible but there was probably hours of discussion upon the fact and not just a five minute uh conversation and Nicodemus gets up and walks out you know and there was probably a whole evening there that they had discussed things and and you know and in the point Nicodemus he said but it wouldn't do me any good because I've understood what you're saying you're saying that I was born wrong so if I was went back to my mother again and come out you would say I'd be born wrong again and and that would be true see that wouldn't wouldn't make any difference but Jesus was talking about another kingdom he was talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost that he had to come and make way far to where that it could come to give his own life you know to bring us into it and we must receive the new birth to become the children of God right I know the purle of the message they of all of those quotes you know oh I always was an eternal I always was a child of God well I agree with what the prophet said but I don't agree with the slant are ways that people use those things for their own benefit because it it can't be contrary to what he would say in another place that's right amen see one can't fight the other one so then we need to to settle down and just think about the fact that we were lost amen doomed and on our way to hell that's right and deserved every bit of it but see Jesus Christ made a way to bring us into the family right all right on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came put them into the kingdom made them in the family of God made the people that are the children of God all right a different type of child not just a child by natural creation as everybody is but this is a a child of God that kind of child that God wanted right all right then we we you know we came down and we lost those rights of of in the the tutorship and the things like that it turned out until it wound up being uh you know to where you can just barely get into the body of Christ and then God had to restore the word and the things and I want you to watch that if I have time to get to it if I don't I will Sunday will you know I just want to be slow that's what I'm trying to make it is real slow and and and anchor it to where you know that you'll know what I believe and the people listening know then what I believe I believe you must be born again before you can have eternal life oh but I believe I always was eternal well read on what the prophet said he said if you have eternal life right amen if you have eternal life the eternal life you have always was eternal all right but yet we're here in a lost condition searching for God trying to find a way and then everybody comes along with telling us we just really didn't need God anyway all we need to do is just wait we die we all go to heaven well wouldn't that be the way it would be if you if you had eternal life you just either wait until something happened at the Big Bang Theory would be banged again in reverse and we go back into eternity and you know but see people don't realize what their doctrines the way that they talk and things of what their doctrines show uh you know how much of the stupidity that we are as human Mortals to try to make our own way but I believe you must be born again and then we were covering that the prophet said God gave you a tutor according to Galatians 4 you know right that the child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all amen though he be an only child say and he's you know an only son and and his total inheritance is when his father passes away he would be air of all things y amen and see he is right there because he's a child of God that's right you know he's a child of the person but yet being that he's he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed all right God knows how to raise children I like brother brother giri years ago he always liked the way sister sister or was you know sister or they had them three boys and and she'd bring this big old long Hickory with you know one them boys act up she just wow she never even lost to beat listening way it look most of the time she just reached over wrapped them and it took care of it you know but God really is the one that knows how to raise children right amen and that's one thing I want you to get out of this I tried to get it in last service and I want to get it into this service I I want to instill into your mind not a a I want this point in your mind we a lot of times look at things and think that there's nothing going on and if we had what we think we have we would to see all of these other things then they'll turn around and say well look at what they've done in the book of Acts well I agree I would have loved to been back there wouldn't you but you know br them from the book of Acts over here and let them stay over here about 3 months they probably want to go back to the book of Acts that's just carnal as I can make the point but the point of it is they were not facing the Devils you and I are having to face every day the prophet said the spirit just he said the spirit that gave their lives back down to the ages he said is in you and I you just be able to overcome right that's right just to be able would overcome right here that's right amen they didn't face what we're facing that's not excuses that's what everybody says about me they say oh you just make excuses you you explain it like a Baptist you know you just explain it away or where you know no it's a fact right ain't an excuse what's your excuse I know people don't like for me to be that harsh but see that's when you throw it out there and be able to take it back and swallow at least what's your excuse right right I know that gets hard and I'm hard myself on it because I don't I don't like for people to to say that God's not doing anything right for us to just live daily in the new birth and and living in the hour We're living is it's harder than the basic the prophet said it be easy to be able to give you life for the gospel right that's right that's right that's it'd be easy to just walk up and say I'm a Christian yep go ahead and kill me but you see then when you start trying to explain them I think you're trying to explain something away there's nobody in this building nobody in this world believes in manifestation any greater than the man you're looking at cuz I've seen God I've seen him manifest himself I've seen the dead raised I've seen the sick heal I've seen storms go away at a at a at a word I've Seen Rain come because of a word I've seen those things and you're witnesses to it right and I'm Witnesses into a lot of of your lives and what you've seen and done and the things that God has done through you it ain't been us anyway see but the thing of it is see God gave us the tutor right amen all right now get to Point the tutors of baptism of the Holy Ghost right that's right right well now listen if you don't believe in dispensations or or stages of something see then you get all messed up because I thought I was listening we was last night I believe night before last to brother Rand on an adoption and and he was talking about he said the no the church agent he said there's no difference that the father and the holy spirit's got to be the same amen he said else Jesus had two daddies that's right all right that's right now so then the tutor you're given is the holy spirit right but that's the father right that comes in you that's right that's not a second person or a third person that comes in you look at what the prophet said said he could search Heaven trying to find the greatest and he said to find the greatest of all the Holy Spirit why see we look at adoption like I said we look at it like the the father's going off the scene that's what I've always heard and it seem what I you know seemingly listen to people that adoption means the father's going off the scene boy look at the son man look look at well look at we're What It Is Well I don't look at it that way that's what I'm trying to get you to see if the holy spirit is the Holy Spirit and that is the father in the form of the Holy Spirit to do the tutoring and raising then the father's inside of you amen amen the very one that the holy spirit is going to report back to right that we look at and try to make trinitarianism out of it the holy spirit's down here and he's trying to cover up and over here's the father and he's going and taking him to report that's just an example that's right y the holy spirit is the Father the father living inside of you right making you a son right cuz it's the only way you can be son right those little things is what I'm trying to cover we preached on adoption we've been through a lot of it but trying to discover some small little minut things that you can't have the Holy Spirit as one person and the father another person right so look what he's doing the father is coming on the scene in the son wasn't that what Jesus was right was not Jesus almighty God manifested in human flesh amen is that true well then if he was almighty God in human flesh what does he expect his children to be right right it wasn't Jesus one person and God another person that's right that won't work out you're going back to your trinitarianism right oh Jesus was God made manifest right he said un let you believe that I am he you will die in your sins that's right that's right y he was was making a statement out there a while ago talking about something I won't say no more than this part of it that that it was you know brother dick and I was about it and a brother said that Jesus didn't heal nobody well I know he's trying to make the body but you better get your scriptures right folks that's right amen amen that's right Amen to forgive sins is to heal all right that's amen right absolutely amen the Bible said the son of man had power on earth right to forgive sins amen now the son of man was the Lord Jesus Christ that's right all right see it sounds beautiful but where is the foundation where's the the basis to hold it on see adoption is not that the father just backs out of and he's off the scene and he's gone no he come on the scene in that new birth that you receive that's God in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost why would it say form why would the prophet use it that way because it's a dispensation right amen right there was a dispensation of the Old Testament y Jehovah God there was a dispensation of Jesus Christ on earth now it's the dispensation of the Holy Spirit right amen who is our tutor our razor y but that's the father coming on the scene in you and me sister Gil it's not the Holy Spirit reporting to the father trying to tell the father how see you said well that's what brother Brown said well you know what he's saying right he's not explaining two or three Gods right he's making a story or an illustration he's dealing with dispensation right the father is trying to get his nature instill into the son right and that's exactly what happened to the Lord Jesus right that he was God Almighty manifested in flesh right and he went through these things remember the life message he had a river Jordan he had a baptismal he had a a time that the Holy Spirit come down and identified him this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell what then he had a Time on Mount of transfiguration this is my beloved Son in whom I pleased to dwell hear ye him right see deeper greater things right but the same God right right amen see he went through these things for you and I that we might be able to go through them so then don't as we're we're talking about the tutor the holy spirit being your razor just put that in your mind and think about it that it's the very nature of almighty God right right it's not a second person coming in to you and live out a little while in you and then he's answering to the third person and this it's just trying to explain things to it as human Mortals that's right like I told Brother dick out there a while ago I said we've been 40 years over 40 years since the prophet left and we needed every day of it and we need 40 more years that's right amen that's true right we need 40 more years of the S the deepen the teaching of yet but we done covered one God have we we've done covered predestination have we I preached predestination ever since I've been in this message but you know I seen here a while back the for knowledge preceded or went before forign knowledge I mean before the predestination right and that helped me amen you see what I seen not all along well did you right BL I saw it yeah but I didn't see it my Revelation a lot of difference in the two right amen you can talk about a lot of things here we've covered one God we've covered water baptism we've covered marriage and divorce but have we why is there so many doctrines around the world about this about who Jesus whether whether it was River Jordan or whether there's two gods or whether there's you know how many they are and what's going on what's the problem well that's just your way of seeing it well if my way is what the Bible says and I'll just stay with my way right you know and you come and show me that it's not don't come along and oh but I want to explain to you the difference between the Holy Spirit and the father oh my it's a selfs same person amen but it's the way he manifest himself right right all right right now see the tutor that Paul was speaking of was the one that would come on the scene and make way you know for in other words God had to come in human flesh make way that you and I could become the children of God right all right then when we become the children of God then we're in line of adoption after our child training you know and I I've done it deliberately I held the quotes and the things of the life message and I told you I was doing it I held it to just down to the point of saying the new birth is what makes us the Sons and Daughters of God and then that new birth brings the tutor into us to teach us so the father's not gone right was God gone somewhere off into the to the Heavenly Heaven somewhere and left Jesus byself no that was still almighty God Amen Y and what are we see then the holy spirit being the tutor is the nature of the father right but it's as a baby as we when we've read it so many times there in Ephesians where we receive the earnest of our inheritance right it just makes us a baby but the prophet I gave you a bunch of quotes and things on the to know where he said that's where the Pentecostal people failed he said they said well we've got it y well us bapst said that right us badst said we got it all when we believe well the Pentecostals come along and they just said we got it all when we shouted and we spoke in tongues and I've heard both the ends of the scales I told you about sitting talking with two men one night one of them went this way and he said I got when I got my new birth I fully adopted son of God right into the body fully adopted headstone everything another guy on the other side was sitting there and he said you didn't get nothing did you don't even have the Holy Ghost yet I said well Brothers let me somewhere stay between both of you know yeah I just want to help them you know to be friends but I I was just plainly telling them I somewhere in between there is where I'm dwelling right Butz I believe in the new birth I believe that makes you a child of God right like I told you that no man is a match for the devil we believe that but the holy spirit in the least member of the body of Christ is not just a match for the Devil he's the devil's God right amen amen and one day he'll bow to that right amen because he's he's our we're his master right all but listen I wrote it down see we don't get a holy ghost as a tutor and then some of these days we'll come up to another place that the father will come on the S no no it's just stages or dispensations or or whatever that you want to make it I'm trying to just make it in an understanding that it comes in and and you don't like to use the word degrees because people don't like that they don't like for you to say well it's negative to positive so you have to go from partial to perfect right brother R didn't have any trouble dealing with negative to positive right he sure used it he must have known what he's talking about but see you and I must receive the new birth to be in the family see whereas in the natural form of adoption the prophet is using as an example unto us the son was born into the family at his natural birth right amen then brought up to the adoption position in the new verse Earth we must receive the new birth to come into the family of God right and then we can start the child training we can be like the scripture says uh in 1 Peter 1:23 Peter says being born again right something going on being be iing I argued with the Baptist when I was back there I said it said he that believeth and his baptized shall be saved I said you're saying he that believes it doesn't say that it said believe right you know cuz I didn't like that that form of doing but Peter said going on in second Peter he said as newborn babes Desiring the sincere milk of the word that's right every person from the time of the ACT book of Acts 120 in the upper room they were tutored and trained in the Holy Ghost fail give them the faith of the fathers right but the 3,000 outside started out as babies they just heard one sermon and they receive the new birth see so then look at everything in child training are stages are are you know growth development whatever you can do in your mind to to make it into your way of thinking but just remember now that you and I must first be born again right the prophet of God said that's the most important thing in the world right is whether or not you're born again that's right am well I don't want to raise a hand I don't want anything I'm just asking you do you know you're born again if not then I would be seeking God Amen that's right oh I know what that is though that devil get on you so oh don't you deny anything now you got to be positive well that's what I'm trying to be as positive I'm as positive as can be if you're not born again you're lost right how much more positive can I get amen no more than I could say that I was born into the World by some other Mechanical Devices other than my mother and father no I wasn't an illegal alien that b down here I had a natural birth didn't you well I must have a spiritual birth right see all right and doing that then then we come to the basis that that the quotes tonight will be being used as to talk about how that that tutor or razor and what he's been doing now he didn't give us an intellectual something to to raise us now listen to the way I say it the five-fold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints we believe that right amen but you know five-fold Ministry is not the Holy Spirit now the Holy Spirit uses the fivefold ministry okay fine we're all right but the holy the holy spirit is your inside teacher right amen right right he's the Advocate he's all the things we need the comforter Etc and you know what you get that when you're born again right you don't grow in Grace and knowledge and then find out you got an advocate he was D when you born again amen he was the Healer he's the Savior he's everything in that new birth all right see then in doing it now watch it tonight or point is what that brother Brandon will tell you the Pentecostals made a mistake of thinking they got everything so now you go around in the message and you talk to people right and you'll find out that they don't believe in not listen to the wording you find out they don't believe in the teaching of the Bible for the prophet's message right oh yeah they read it they said no they don't believe in the teaching of it right amen they don't believe that they need somebody to teach them that right they believe like brother R said they believe they say we've got an inside teacher we don't need a teacher he said well then why did God put teachers in the body you know the fold Ministry that's right but you see that's what people will do and I'm talking about preachers I'm talking about congregations I'm talking about around the world cuz they don't believe him right but now brother D now brother I'm telling you now you you're just all messed up and you're thinking okay all right you you you you just don't understand about everybody else okay I ain't going to argue with you I evidently don't think like they do cuz I Don't Preach like they do but I'm going to make a statement to you and I want you to think about it for a while and if I finish the message I'll explain it tonight if I don't I'll wait till Sunday I want to ask you a simple question and you'll see why we've been here 40 years or 44 Rel right you know somewhere close to that how do you get the virtues in the Statue of a perfect man all right now most of you have been around long enough you've heard me preach on it over and over and over and over so you ought to be able to answer me at least the words but how do you get it you show me one church and I'm as serious as I can be folks I'm not you show me one Church where they preach dress hire clothes and women and what they're doing and this that and the other ever service and I'll show you that they're still doing the same thing after 40 years see what we look at it is we think that we just need faith and so what we need to do we just need to preach faith you but need preach Faith you all right I agree with you but then we say we need virtal well let's just preach on virtue we'll just preach about 20 years on virtues and we'll you on virtue we'll get virtue well had 40 years where you at right you see I don't mind saing no time because you're looking at a man has never been that way you're looking at a man has tried his best to bring you the message of the hour in this best that could ever be brought and not my own opinion right but yet where is the popularity they'd rather have a guy that's made 15 predictions and none of them come to pass they'd rather have somebody just gone off in adultery literally and spiritually especially than to hear somebody that really they can stand and talk about the word now you won't admit it but you know that's true right you know it's true sure you've been around long enough most of you have you know it's true will it bring virtue for us to preach on virtue will it bring patience for us to beat each other up why now you going to get patience oh brother they have tribulation working patience is that going to bring it right how can you tie together your new birth with your adoption as I said when I started it stages I don't know how to explain it stages you know doings one after the other but it's all the same work of the Holy Spirit right amen the holy spirit that justified you will sanctify you and it'll baptize you into the body Y and that's not three works of Grace right that's three stages of the same Grace but how can we get these things can you tie together your Doctrine with your new birth well now naturally if all you know about the New Birth is that I shouted screamed cried PL you know done this that the other if that's all you know about the New Birth then uh no wonder you can't tie nothing together but I thought the new birth was the birth of the word amen I mean that's the way I believe it I believe the new birth is the birth of the word so then the headstone would be all the word right right amen well it's being born again something's going on that Holy Spirit has been leading us and drawing us upward right by the preaching of the Gospel see one of these days you'll understand why brother Dale does like he does that I never felt led to go back and literally take the seals one after the other and preach on them again and a lot of you are listening to them now and saying well you know what it sound just like you're talking right now that's 82 83 84 right because you don't have to go back and preach it again cuz it's still stands right but I'm just trying to make a point now listen see we we wonder well why isn't things going on now you don't pray for rain and a monso season right I mean is that sensible I mean you got a monso season dumping inches of rain on you every day and everything's floody and everything and you say well I'm going to pray for rain now you want to pray for it to quit right what you see it's got to be dry in other words to pray for rain so it have to be a drought for you to really get down to Pray For Rain if you're not sick you're you're not praying to be healed are you right so many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord leadth out of them all it doesn't make me down and out because that we're sick and and problems and troubles and heartaches yes it does on one basis because I would sure love to see every one of us healed delivered walk away here in glorified bodies tonight right yes sir read amen I'd love to see every one of us be able to even just be changed back to young man to young woman let alone a change and go up into the glory right because with that would automatically come a whole lot better position than we're living in but where is that going to change us all right see then the prophet tells you what our troubl is you know what our trouble is you know what my trouble is me my trouble's not you m my trouble is me your trouble is the one you looking in the mirror at when you look and you know right right there's your trouble right it's not somebody else cuz ain't nobody big enough to get in front of you kind like brother M was that time when they here Ling this old boy was the law come up and they was doing a bunch of things and this old boy run over to hide and he he hid behind a tu before you know a post well the policeman walked over there and said what are you doing he said hiding there was a whole whole lot more of him outside than there was he you know and that's our problem is me and you now here is some things that you will not like because you won't understand when the prophet of God in some of these quotes that we give he said your sons and daughters are doing things wrong he said they become organizational minded he said they're out doing things of the world he said they're staying home from church and watching television he says your daughters are wearing immoral clothing I tell you bless God that ain't me brother he he was talking about people that was lost now you go argue with him remember he was the prophet and he was the one that the Holy Spirit had to straighten out one day when he said you quit calling my children Ricky and ricketta you remember that he said that's my children well you know what he was saying he was calling Ricky and Rickett you know what because they were Ricky and Rickett right they were living just like Ricky and they were living like rickettes he had every right humanly to say that but the holy spirit said you're talking about my children you see we're so judgmental and that's one of the things the prophet uses to talk about that we don't come to adoption because of that fussing and arguing and little petty feelings and things but brother Dale you believe he's just living like the devil I've explained that but I've also explained that I don't believe in a big sin and a little sin I've tried to be as much as I could to explain those things even to Breaking Down The Body Spirit spirit and soul to show that that it's not the soul that sinth because if it is then that soul is lost but in our spirit and our body we do things wrong and you ask brother brandham said brother brandham do you sin he said every day right now is that right did he say that amen he's not sin every day was was he sinning in his soul or was he s in his body and spirit oh he's just sinning in his soul well that's he was just sinning in his soul he's lost right man that's blun right but you see through the opening of the word we can know the difference I'll get back to it in a few minutes but I just want to talk about it but random says what you've got them you read them he said he has to bring a report to the father of our Disobedience now do any of us have Disobedience we're going to take on the next uh time that we have Bible study it's going to be on Galatians 5 works of the flesh you think you got works of the flesh no sir read I think I said murder adultery you break that word down amen that's right right get a dictionary and see what that word murder means sorry and remember the prophet said if you kill anybody's influence you've murdered them that's right of course we don't do that you see I'm just trying to lay down a point because if you and I now you're not going to like this point but I'm going to make it there's a lot of quotes here the prophet covers about our Disobedience and about how that we are not lined up and how that we we stay at home on watch TV on Wednesdays or whatever we do and and that we're we're trying to be we want to be intellectuals to be rais that away and and all other things but you know if we got every bit of this straight if we could line up everything this Prophet says right here and I'm waving before the congregation I don't know probably 30 quotes and I believe every one of them but if we could line everyone up with that it still be no Rapture right be a better people but not a Rapture right it would not bring one New Birth if we lined up to everything that's in here right that's right that's strong is it to know that you're prophet in the way he preached but he's the ones that's telling us that's the way it is if we could line up our lives until we lived a total Perfection of perfection it would not save us right it would make us more lost than ever right you agree amen you see we're looking at it in a way I've always seen people when they look at adoption we're going to we're going to keep going like this one of these days we're going to start getting better and we're going to start getting better and we're going to start getting better and Bo we'll just find we'll just get so good until we walk off the earth I wish that was true amen but the more the Lord Jesus came in contact and the more he came into Authority the worse things got around him not in him now but around him think on it he says we're not progressing because that we're not listening to him a lot of quotes here I hope I'm getting my point across at least for one thing I know it don't don't seem to be but still I'm trying if we lined up to everything the prophet of God had to say right we would be no closer to adoption right I said if we we we lined up if we could get ourselves lined up it wouldn't be no closer because you see God's got a away amen it's going to be his way that's right yeah he's not going to send the headstone your Prophet said because of your merits he said he'll send it because he promised it am boy you sure are a funny preacher because you don't believe in living right no I don't believe in living right I don't I've made that plain I know people don't understand you cut your tape off you really got me there had you I believe in being born again I believe that the tutors coming inside of you right the razor inside of you the father's inside of you I believe the new birth is Father Son and Holy Ghost dwelling in you amen that's right all and see that way let him live out right right amen and just remember then no matter how good that it comes that we can live we would never be able to reach a Perfection therefore it's talking about be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect that is not talking about stopping doing things right that's not it is taking his nature and depending upon your sacrifice well you the way you sound it's just it's okay to go do anything now if I've got to explain that to this congregation that's setting here now maybe out there on the internet maybe they're listening they don't understand me I I know that but if I've got to explain to this church that I believe in just living like a garbage can everything going to be all right right no right but I believe Sons and Daughters of God have trouble right amen and I believe what your Prophet said but you don't even listen to him see brother Brown made a statement he makes a lot of statements about that he made a statement one time that really was concerning me a lot cuz he said I don't preach because I'm saved you remember that right he said I Don't Preach because I'm saved he said because I'm saved whether I preach or not but you better swallow it because you better finish the rest of the statement brother around make he said if I go out here on on the creek bank and sit down and Don't Preach no more I'm still safe now if you go out on the creek bank and you sit down you're not in church but see he's making a point right right cuz his point is I say because I I preach because I love God right not because I'm saved or anything that's right amen that's I preach because he called me and I want to help his people right now he ain't going out on the creek bank and sitting down is he he's just making a strong point just like he's making a point when he says your sons and daughters are out here living in the world and he's talking about Christians no no no no no he's not talking about born again he's talking about church Christians well why is he explaining so much about the tutor he's explaining that he give you the tutor and you got the tutor and still go out and do wrong Now read do I need to read it he's explaining that he gave you the tutor and you're still doing wrong cuz you see we're not looking at it the way he's talking about it he said a child is a child and he says there's nothing you can do to get away from being a child right but he said adoption is your growth development or your tutoring or training then we look at it as thinking that if there would be some way that I could get better I'd get adopted right right now why would it say that Jesus grew in Grace and knowledge why does it say that you youever thought about the scripture say that you know yeah and that being a child learned he obedience by the things that he suffered and being made perfect but you know them people that was there with the money changers and the things like that did they really think he is perfect when he platted a rope and run them out right uh people in this message see they try to explain everything I know a couple of Brothers tried their best to explain that to me one time and they said well what he done now he didn't beat the people that he beat the animals I said man that's worse that's right absolutely animals didn't have anything to do with getting in there the people took them in there but you see it sounded good that he didn't beat the people he beat the animals well that make him a hypocrite right because he'd be beating the animals and the Animals had nothing to do with getting in there right I said y'all making it worse but see it didn't change that cuz once you get that thing in your mind you just going to play around with them little things what you see what brother Brandon would call Christians we call Devils right you know did he said Billy Graham had the baptism of the Holy Ghost old robbers huh but you see we we want to look at it so that we've gauged it so much until if if there's any little Mark we're just not a Christian no more brother R said about many men in this message and he said they got the baptis G and the Holy Ghost you said now what they got is they got it on their Spirit Well now maybe that might be right I'm going going to argue with you I'm going to just say that's up between you and brother Brown talk about see see because we think that we've got to the point and and it's never been taught that here so you you got to had it somewhere else because I never taught it I never taught some kind of a human profess ction In the Flesh right I've never done that I'm a firm believer in that there's none good no not one amen but I'm a firm believer in an atonement a sacrifice an advocate a conforter and I'm dependent upon him to make a way for me to do that see yep you Pentecostal people you jumped the fence you thought that when you were born again that settled it that was that only was the beginning that's right right you're a son surely when you're born but when this son was born he wasn't air of all things yet he had to go through the testings and trials to find out if he was the right type of son to fall air of all things don't you stay in it you say we've been here 40 something years and we're not no further up the road we preached all the doctrines I differ with you 100% we preached doctrines yes right doctrines Revelation is a lot of difference and the Revelation and Doctrine a lot of difference in the two words revelation will bring us to adoption but because we beat each other and holler and screamed at each other you know how many of you women wear long dresses because you're afraid somebody will say something to you about it or is it really from the inside that it wouldn't matter if you was out in the backs side of the desert you'd wear the same thing well if I had the Holy Spirit I would what he never sent an AR Bishop to be our tutor a general overseer or District man man there's where we've made our mistake who do you follow what group are you in you follow the Thunders the vires River Jordan Two Souls Lites brother Dale talks plain amen well I just I don't understand what you're talking about now I'm just trying to make one point to us we we are the only people that don't follow a man you ever thought of that we're accused of that right but every denomination has got a man they follow you said but I follow brother brand well see that's where your problems at Paul said follow me as I follow Christ if you follow the same Christ that brother brandham was following amen but if you're following Brother brandham Where are we we've got into archbishops and governors and general overseers and all of that if his character didn't show up right he didn't inherit anything he was just a son now remember I explained that if you're truly born again there's no way if you die and go to hell cuz you can't lose your sunship you know right right but that don't mean we have all inheritance because we're try we've got to come through that but what are we talking about just looking down and reading some things you can read them the teacher must be an honest person not a man that wants the father to Pat him on the back but a man that'll be honest with the father if the child is disobedient he'll walk up with a shame face and say sir I'm sorry to bring this message but your child is so dilit he doesn't listen to nothing he's not concerned at all how the father must feel just thinking of these things what's the matter today we've adopted a different tutor for the Church of the Living God than what God gave us amen see we want man to lead us right and I admit around this message that that's what I see most of the people preachers want they want you to follow them right they'd be tickled to death if you wouldn't never make a decision unless you went and asked them whether to drive a Cadillac or a Buick or buy a house or whatever to do but please don't bother me with it tell me you pray about your decision to go buy something and I'll be glad to do that but I'm not going to counsel you about what kind of car or house to buy but that's what people want but you see I want the Holy Spirit to lead you and then I ain't got to worry about it I have no concern about somebody that's led by the Holy Spirit right you say well brother D the Holy Spirit told me to go here and not come to church for 3 months well you go do what the holy spirit said if you do now that kind of a doing I wouldn't agree with too much right but that's still up to you because it's you that's being child trained the holy spirit is to raise the church and nurture it in honor and respect to the father and of his word adoption how what's my son doing the father would ask he's the most hard-headed kid I ever seen in my life yeah that's number six on your notes going to get over read most hard-headed kid I've ever seen in my life now remember my point brother random is talking about all of these examples as someone with the tutor read right he's talking about somebody with the tutor that's hardheaded that don't go to church that lays out and just does what they want to arrogant and hateful and attitudes he's talking about people with the tutter Y but now now brother D he can't be meaning that got the Holy Ghost well now you got to talk to brother BR Brother D you it sounds like you're saying it's just okay for us just live anyway with the Holy Ghost noise I didn't say that where'd you get that idea well I got it from hearing what you say but you see these are babies he's talking about see little different story now right see you thought I was talking about it's okay just anything in the world now brother Brandon's talking about when you get the Holy Spirit you're just a baby and babies are the ones that are hardheaded and organizational minded and running here in Yonder and wearing the wrong clothes and laying out a church and doing these things every one of these he talking about a baby read him he ain't talking about a full grown a full grown person don't do that m I know how I've been around a while I know out of quote a little bit brother brother said you can't get a holy ghost filled woman put on a pair of pants now he didn't say a baby he said a holy ghost F woman because one day you was a baby naturally right we acted like babies right and when we got born again you know what we were that's where brother R said you Pentecostals is messed it up he said cuz you think you got everything when you got the new birth other words CU they run in spok in tongues like R said that lady said the brother so and so said run off the with the the piano player but said he called me the other day said he still got to Victory cuz he's speaking in tongues on the telephone well now you know I don't agree with that see you thought I was going some other way so now it's up to you to repent of what you thoughts were get back on track where I'm at I'm talking about the thing brother rown was talking about and you read them and see he's talking about babies right newborn babies that desire the sincere milk of the word to learn to do things and I am not saying that it's okay for you to do things wrong I'm just saying your Advocate is covering for you until you grow old enough in God to learn to live right right are you listening see you thought I was going some other way with that didn't you if I was you I would listen real careful before I made much statements in my mind you might find out we're following the right truth newborn babies are babies and that's the way they live they look around to see what clothes somebody's wearing or what somebody's doing or what they're saying or how they're acting cuz they're just like little babies little babies pay close attention little kids close attention to what you do that's why you better be careful where you do things right you better be careful around them little kids about 2 or 3 years old you know why they going to act just like you that's right and then they going to be like the children were in the Bible you know went out there and said go up old bald head them kids wouldn't have made fun of that Prophet like that it was Mom and Daddy was making fun of the Prophet right abely what are you trying to get across brother Dale I'm trying to get across one thing in this message tonight let's get away from belittling one another looking down on one another trying to get everybody body else to line up and not lining ourselves up let's start working on our own s qu being so much judgmental is that some of the things the prophet let's see I wrote one of them down I had to look up the word but I'm sorry I'm just I'm not able to handle all these words like a lot of you are but let's see if I can find that one words brother call a diligent Dil there or something like that I had to look it up it means unworthy yeah in no excuse me Indigent i n d i g n a n d Indigent I guess You' say he said that means unworthy the Webster says you know brother R says that's what we are we're unworthy but you know God never throw a baby away I wish I could preach like a lot of people but I just have to tell you the way I think right when you're a newborn baby you act like a newborn baby you do like a newborn baby you'll lay out a church you'll just do what you want to you'll go and do things that you know but you see I want us to grow up not to learn not to sin now that's not what I'm talking about huh oh I had to grow in Grace like brother WBY said that lady said that time said I had to grow in Grace and knowledge before I could start going to the movie Pi show now that wasn't exactly what I'm talking about amen I don't think you can grow in Grace and knowledge through learn how to sin don't worry about it you already know right the day I got born again Bo I haven't had a dirty thought since then you're the biggest liar in the building am what you see babies act like babies maybe 71 years old yeah but act like babies what is the holy spirit going to report of Our Lives all right but you see why did Brother brandham not stay if all all you needed is uh lining up in your natural life things why did he not stay that way in his Doctrine right instead of preceding on into the opening of the word right you don't think like that you listen to the early message Mees of brother brandham and you listen to the later message of brother BR and and you'll think that brother brandham was doing the same thing brother Dale was doing a while ago that he was just backing up he was just saying it's all right to do anything in the world cuz you know what I'm saying it's right brother random in his early Ministry he hammered hard about clothes and and doings and life and living but in the end he said he didn't have time to preach on them he didn't have time to iate babies right he said I'm so concerned with this message that I am to bring Y and said don't you call them Ricky and Ricketts that's my children I would ask you to do one thing is to listen to this message again cuz I'm just talking I think this is a good way to get the point down we think that in 40 years we would have been able to some way make ourselves better W work right all of the Clos line Holiness and I firmly am a believer in clothline Holiness preacher amen I see a lot of stuff around here that I don't like but why don't you just preach against it well where has it ever done any good well go to the person that's doing it tell them or would that do any good and I'm not scared of running you off if I thought it'd run you off for me to go to you I would come to you in a hurry just take my word for it I'd come to you in a hurry if I thought it'd run you off but I know it won't because you'll sit there and S up and become a pickled up prun I ain't talking about brother Al either I can say things about him but you see there has never been but one thing that would ever bring this there's never been and never will be but one thing that'll ever bring this message I mean bring this people to adoption all right look at the last to the last quote number 11 on your notes there's never been but one thing that will ever bring this prde to adoption we cannot preach clothline Holiness hard enough and strong enough to bring it into manifestation because it'll always fall off somewhere 363 Church AG book they said a moment ago that the false Vine came into full futri in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree wherein Lodge the fowls of the Earth at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then it must also be true that the bride church WIll mature and her ripness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word I don't underline that if I you and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness now what is godliness brother around said I looked everywhere to try to find what godliness is he said to be like God all right I thought that would be the nature of the father and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of Darkness come against this true bride the true true vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did okay then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that the bride and the groom may be forever United as one already the visible manifestation stations are of what I have been telling you are seen all around us The ecumenical move of the tires is factual but also it is a fact that the prophet for the last age must be bringing forth a message from God that will forun the second coming of the Lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers and with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power right you want power power apart from character is satanic right that's what the prophet said so what is it characterist lady oia is what your Prophet said it is what about it do we want a character that's molded by suffering or we don't or do we want a character that's molded by a characterless lady of see and age right which one is it that's name which one is it come on brother I hope you go back and listen to this message don't talk to me and tell me what it sounded like go back and listen to the miss that cuz if you say it to me so you should I want just tell you so go back listen the message if there's anybody believes in living rights you know I do you know I don't believe in just being any kind of a garbage can but I know little babies and don't matter how old they are they still little babies right they may have been around to message for 20 30 40 years but they're still little babies still wanting sugar tits to be able to just little sermons and sermon and P you on the back and tell you how good and then oh boy that preacher he really got all over my toes well why don't you put your shoes on get the toes out of the way what do you say down there is no way to come to adoption the way people's preached it right but I'll tell you one thing that from day one when I saw what that Prophet has said I've tried to preach the Revelation to give you an opportunity by Revelation to be able to inherit your inheritance cuz the only way you'll get your inheritance is by the reveal word so then you see why did I preach so hard about Revelation and I preach so hard about the seals down your 70 weeks marriage and divorce whatever you want to cover to give you an opportunity to be able to say the word can build me into what I'm supposed to be right the word can make a child of God the word can bring a person to adoption but the reveal word is the only thing that will if you don't like that I'm sorry that's what brother Dale believes I believe that the revealing of the word will bring you up the statue of a perfect man cuz that's what I done I asked brother Mo when he preached it in 71 I said okay now you preached it I believe it he preached every one of those virtues and things to the letter and I believe it I still believe exactly what he preached about it but I said now how do I get him I want to know how to get right well it was about 1980 and the Lord spoke to him and said it's only by the revealing of the word and the virtues be brought in to a person do you know what I've been preaching ever since then try to preach enough word with the college where you can make it it's only by the
