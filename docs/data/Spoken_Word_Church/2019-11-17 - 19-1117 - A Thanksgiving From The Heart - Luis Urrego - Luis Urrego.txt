TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] okay should we just heart everybody and is that is that facing them in its own accord it's needed to position it but yeah you often just make sure I'm always on the camera man usually brother Ryan's the one who's teaching there this morning brother Bob's not here so alright well we'll just go ahead and get started I hope everyone's doing well and has had a good weekend and and I can't believe it's almost Thanksgiving and this year is almost over so this this last part of the year usually goes faster than the than the first part of the I don't know exact all right now this year - yeah yeah all right so listen we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna read from Luke chapter 17 Luke chapter 17 and we're just gonna read a little a little story here and I know that you all are probably familiar with this story but we're gonna read it I just kind of glean some things from it and a little bit about Thanksgiving all right Luke 17 verse 11 and it says here and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem Jesus going to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee now I want you to notice where he was passing through he was passing through the midst of Samaria and Galilee Samaria being where the Samaritans live they're half Jew half Gentile okay they were despised people by the Jews the Jews did not like them because have Gentile mixed with them and then you want to have anything to do with Gentile so it goes on and says and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood far off so the lepers the lepers were far from him they were not in close proximity to him there were they met him they saw they and they probably heard that Jesus was coming they probably heard of the things that Jesus was doing the miracles that were taking place in Jesus's life and then and then these these lepers they see them coming from far off and you know back then leprosy but you know as horrible as leprosy is some of those some of us who are from third world countries I mean know you know that you see it there a lot and I we were near leper colony in the Philippines there near were brother Danny dumpling those house is and but the leper colony isn't I don't think it's there anymore but but they're still leprosy still going on for the salmon went to it okay and so yeah it's still going on and there's still a few cases here and there especially down towards the border of Mexico and us you'll still hear little cases here and there of leprosy but it's it's a terrible disease and and it starts but it starts eating your skin it starts eating your limbs off and you start feeling numb at the at the end of your limbs and where you don't even feel that your nerves start dying so you don't even feel that your nose is falling off you don't even think you just you just you just know that it is and you know it's very gruesome and not not only that but since collects is rotting and I don't know if you ever smelled of rotting flesh dead flesh it stinks now I'm just trying to give you this picture of what these ten lepers were like they probably stunk they probably and they were hung hanging out together and they were not even with their families anymore he you see when they were when they when you were consider a leper and you were a bona fide leper according to the law of Yemen and Leviticus you were supposed to be cast out you were supposed to be separated from your people from friends these these men probably had businesses these men probably had jobs families they were probably thriving and then also and this comes upon them and so you could see how they were very uh they you know Jesus was coming let me do what I can to get his attention there's a lepers back then what they would do is they really exercised their their screaming in their voice because they had to either to get attention from for help for from people but to also to let people know hey we're lepers stay away and so they were used to always shouting and and and and you know using the high-pitched voice you know so that's the case of these lepers here so in verse 12 in verse 13 and they lifted up their voices and said see you see how they lifted up their voices because they were not in close proximity to Jesus they were screaming and said Jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them now verse 14 and when he saw them he said unto them to me it seems like Jesus was approaching them he heard them so he was gonna go to them he's gonna saying because in order for it it wasn't like he was yelling to him yeah he didn't say he lifted his voice it looks like he was approaching to him now how many how many of us would if we had lepers screaming out at us would we go an approach time you know I'm getting out of you know how I'm so visual I need to show but but you see how Jesus was approaching them he wasn't scared he wouldn't be like most of us you know oh no he's the leopard get away I believe God healed you yeah but you know stay away know Jesus knew where he was standing and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priest now you see how the word tells them to go obey the word that that in that that law out there is in Leviticus that when that when you thought that you were cleansed of leprosy you were to go show up believers living 13 if I'm not mistaken you were to go show and present yourself to the priest because the priest or the high priest was kind of like a doctor as well because he would go and he is somebody says the cow was a leper looks like I've been clean cleansed Duluth the priest had to go he had to be examined that the leper had to be examined thoroughly before he could before the priest could actually say you're okay you're bonafide clean go back to your family go back into society and it was the priest that decided that so Jesus didn't even pray for them Jesus didn't even say that you've been healed he just told him go away the word say go go do what the word says go show yourselves unto the priest and they came to pass that as they went now I like that because you see they took Jesus's word and then okay Jesus you told us to go and see the priest in faith we're gonna do it so they kept they kept walking and they were going to the priest they and as they went as they were exercising their faith and what Jesus told to go do to go obey the word they were cleanse praise the Lord amen so it's in new exercise in the it isn't that didn't have to be like somebody laid hands on you it didn't have to be that somebody that somebody just prayed a incredible prayer just shook you and all kinds of stuff that's wonderful it's great but when you take God at His Word he appreciates that more than anything else and you believe that word and you take action on that word I mean that's powerful that's living by faith and that's what living by faith is it's not something SuperDuper that we sometimes think that it's ripping the shirt off and there's a Superman logo you know do you know but it's it's just Lord you've said it I believe it that settles it I'm taking your word and sister do you think that Jesus the faith that he had because he was God I mean he must have prayed for those people well I mean he I'm sure that human element of him haven't haven't had to do that as well because I mean he was human you say and so I'm sure that he had to have to remember he was he had all God in him so now there is an example where a brother from South Carolina he's passed away now and do you all remember the story of the but the Studebaker car brother Gerald Cleveland who was living in South Carolina and he had a he had a he had a car who back he went to one brother branham's meetings and the brakes completely went out from the car that brother brother George Smith wrote about this story back in like the 90s and in that only believe magazine and in that in that story where the Cleveland tells us because I heard him tell us he says that at some point just to make the long story short at some point he asks brother branham he said brother Brown can you can you go ahead and pray for us we need to go drive back to South Carolina and we need to cross through the mountains and all that and we have a sick sister that we need to carry back she was sick and it was brother Baxter's of wives mom brother sister Smith that's right she was sick and yeah and so and so brother brother Cleveland said that it was right after they had gotten out from the Blue Boar restaurant it was one of the restaurants where they normally would were to eat at and brother branham he said that brother branham is his brother of Cleveland's onward brother branham oh he didn't even pray for the vehicle he just said he just kind of looked he just kind of looked at it it kind of looked at him and he said brother Cleveland you just go now now you take that for exactly and and and the the car and when they were driving down through the mountains yeah the mechanic Brown took us it was a Sunday there was no mechanics opened anywhere so they said if you just keep putting brake fluid in the car it should get you going all the way to South Carolina but you're gonna have to keep refilling and as they were driving they never had to put that he hit the banisters dad brother sister banisters mom dad said brother Cleveland cuz he would say he said he would drive you and accelerate it and then he hit the brake there are and then he'll accelerate again and he hit the brake and they almost he's my brother Cleveland this thing looks like he's got new brakes he said I believe it they were able to get and sister Smith was healed too yeah now at that point both brother Brown had already preached the seals and it was up believe was 1964 that was around the time when he preached the future home and I think that's where they that's what yeah or he was about to but you know at some point at that time you know brother Brennan I believe was was adopted you know full adoption yeah I intake you know you take Jesus Christ fullness of God dwelled in him where he didn't even have to even pray he didn't have to and was God and probably maybe the Lord even showed him that they weren't gonna be healed you know he was God so giving that example but anyway so they go and the Bible says that they were planners now one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God now he's using that same voice that he was trying to warn people and he was trying to try to get people to help him you know now he's using that same voice to glorify to glorify God and he fell down on his face verse 16 he fell on his face at his feet giving him thanks and and you know if you take a look you know he fell down on his face and he's probably wondering he's probably thinking you know what I'm not only just healed but now I'm gonna be restored back to society I'm gonna reuse my probably I'm gonna have my job back I'm gonna be all these wonderful things are probably going through my family yeah would be with his family and everything like that I mean his whole life was about to change so he had a lot to be thankful for now even though he was the only one who came back to thank God the other ones still kept their healing you see it wasn't like their healing was gone because they didn't come back to thank God so if we keep reading here he says any fellows feet given him Jesus thanks and look how the Bible makes it clear it makes it and he was a Samaritan now that you know the Bible doesn't put things in there just to put him there and he was a Samaritan you want to look and if he wanted to it's like God letting us know okay here's Jesus he came to his own the Jews his own received him not his his own people didn't even want to listen to what Jesus had to say yeah the Samaritan came back to thank God to thank Jesus and Jesus answering said we're not ten cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that returned to give glory to God say this stranger now you see he wasn't even talking to that to that man because I mean he's referring to him as this stranger so he wasn't talking to him directly he was talking to the people around him they must have because I mean if I'm talking to sister Peggy I'm not referring to hers you know that's this stranger as this woman we're gonna have Thanksgiving dinner today no no wait sister Peggy we're having Thanksgiving do you know it's a port more personal so he was talking to probably the people around him they were listening to him at the moment because then he turns and he says he says and Jesus answering said we're not ten cleansed but where are they where are their other none there are not found that returned to give glory to God save this stranger and they said unto Him see now he turns to him and says unto Him arise go that way thy faith hath made me hold now I thought he was already healed that's a totally different then when you look when you look at this at that word at that word hole right there that's the that's the word so so and it it means it means to save keep save sound to rescue from danger instruction to save a suffering from disease to make well heal restore the help to preserve one who is in danger to save in the technical biblical sense negative to deliver from the penalties of the Messianic judgment to say from the evils which obstruct the reception's of me in other words from from sin you see it wasn't it he got an even his heart Jesus knew his heart that he was coming back you know as in a repent of way you know that thankfulness was a repent of thankfulness it was totally different than just being healed and this and if you look in Romans I have it here in Romans chapter Romans chapter 10 and I believe it's C think is verse 9 right here where it says it that thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved no see that's the same word Sozo so it's it's a totally different totally different that that man came back and because of his heart see God knows the heart God knows the reason why you're doing - Oh Thomas it's ok to say thanks it's ours it was wonderful thank you Lord and praise God but then now there's a different thankfulness that really comes from a long chain that actually changes you from the inside out and God knows that amen so so go back here so it's interesting that uh that he came back and he would Jesus told him he said go that way that faith hath made made me hope it was an exact same thing that he told the lady that was had the blood issues for many years he said thy faith hath made you whole you know night you were healed all right but now you know that faith hath made you whole now of course there was no Holy Spirit at the time the Holy Ghost hadn't come Jesus had not died but there was a salvation for them at the time at the most that they could believe at you know but and that's that's to me that's more important than that if we can brother Brian always said you know you can be healed and you're gonna eventually get sick again right and that's why Brad Grant said you can't major on a minor and say you can't major on miracles or healings you can't you can't that you have to major on what's what it is the major and that's the salvation and the healing of the salt because that's eternal you see and so uh so I just wanted to point that out you know that scripture and here's some up here's some few other scriptures in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 18 it says and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess they'll be filled with the spirit they feel with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in Colossians chapter 3 options chapter 3 verse 15 through 17 and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and being he thankful but the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him add that that Thanksgiving it entered into that as well no I'll end with this around says here we are your people we are not under any bondage we are free the son has made us free and we are free indeed to serve our Lord and our Father we thank thee talk about a Thanksgiving day for freedom we've got a real every days of Thanksgiving day every hours every hour is a Thanksgiving Day I who was blind can now see I who was a sin now saved Oh God how free we are how we can give you Thanksgiving Thanksgiving from our heart see that Jesus Christ the Son of God is not dead but he's a lot amongst us tonight proving himself alive by signs wonders and miracles pouring out the Holy Ghost upon his church in the last days just before his appearing and signs and wonders appearing everywhere marvelous things in the God of heaven Oh hallelujah give him praise and glory unto God oh how we thank you for these things it's a real Thanksgiving in our heart to receive the praise of your people Lord we love you and we know that you are every a reward of those who diligently seek you so let's just give him thanks from our heart because then that will change us you all may dismiss [Music]
