[0:02] I want to see
[0:07] amen and amen and amen to see the Lord
[0:10] you look into his word and then turn
[0:13] around and look back at his people don't
[0:15] you amen
[0:16] good to see everybody in the house of
[0:18] the Lord if you'd like to turn in your
[0:19] scriptures
[0:20] turn where we're reading from Matthew
[0:22] 19.
[0:24] and we will continue our thought on
[0:26] marriage and divorce now this question
[0:29] was laid on my office probably six or
[0:32] eight months ago and I've announced it
[0:34] many times we'd be preaching on it so
[0:37] you know just take the thought from the
[0:40] Lord and ask him to speak to you about
[0:43] all of the things because it won't end
[0:45] with just a physical situation you read
[0:49] marriage and divorce but if you will
[0:51] read the invisible Union
[0:54] because if we can't tie together the
[0:57] literal fact of it though then we will
[0:59] not see what is meant totally in the
[1:01] spiritual fact you know of the invisible
[1:05] Union because that was a great message
[1:07] he said it was a greater portion of
[1:10] marriage and divorce so then that way
[1:12] you know we knew it but you know and I
[1:14] like to say to people somebody maybe
[1:16] hear this in Internet or something then
[1:19] you know you wonder well way we have to
[1:21] lay it down sometimes it it looks like
[1:23] there's no hopes for anybody
[1:26] but then just remember uh
[1:30] the best way of saying it there's only
[1:32] one sin unto death and that's
[1:34] blaspheming the Holy Ghost because of
[1:37] marital problems wouldn't be a sin unto
[1:40] death you know so then hold on and God
[1:44] always can give an answer because if
[1:46] there's any question or thought then
[1:47] there has to be an answer to go with it
[1:50] so remember that now remember the Bible
[1:52] study will be Saturday the the first
[1:54] Saturday in May at six o'clock remember
[1:57] the fellowship meeting will be on the
[1:59] third Saturday 3 30. brother Jonathan
[2:02] Jones will be here preaching for us now
[2:05] if there's any of you from out of town
[2:08] you know we've got a sign up sheet down
[2:10] there a dose from out of town now not
[2:12] because Wade and them can come over the
[2:14] house and spend the night not close in
[2:16] you know but from out of town and you
[2:19] need a place to stay on that fellowship
[2:22] meeting Saturday night there's no need
[2:24] of driving back home but there's a sign
[2:27] up sheet down there sign up and somebody
[2:28] will put you in their home you know and
[2:31] and everything and it won't be any
[2:32] problems you won't have to be traveling
[2:34] backwards and forth on on your doing so
[2:37] remember that just you know keep it in
[2:39] your mind right I know you already have
[2:42] but pray for Brother Gary Krantz his
[2:44] father he's in bad shape and also just
[2:47] keep praying for him the Lord would
[2:48] would touch him and and do any other
[2:51] announcements hi Jimmy
[2:52] Mirch
[2:55] okay all right let's pray father we
[2:57] thank you for your love and your grace
[2:59] unto us we thank you for Calvary thank
[3:02] you for all things and we just ask you
[3:04] this morning to come Among Us and be not
[3:07] an onlooker or a recorder of our lives
[3:09] and our Deeds but to be the preeminent
[3:12] one in each one of our hearts and lives
[3:14] that you can reveal yourself unto us
[3:17] because lord it's a it's a day when we
[3:20] need more there's the prophet said we
[3:22] need Revelation more than anything so
[3:24] then we ask you to just come Among Us
[3:26] and speak to us and God each one of us
[3:29] Lord in your love and Lord just bless
[3:31] those that are not with us remember the
[3:33] sick among us and just help each and
[3:35] every one of us to walk in you and to be
[3:38] with brother Gary's dad our Lord he's on
[3:41] up in age so remember him and and just
[3:44] be with him and comfort him have your
[3:46] way with each and every one of us in
[3:48] Jesus name
[3:49] amen
[3:51] all right Matthew 19.
[3:54] that said we'll read this scripture
[3:56] basically in every thought until we get
[3:59] you know to doing because it covers the
[4:02] whole thing all right Matthew 19 and
[4:04] verse 3. foreign
[4:08] also came unto him tempting him now
[4:11] what's tempting him saying unto him is
[4:15] it lawful for a man to put away his wife
[4:16] forever cause we've got Moses we know
[4:20] what he's taught us you know
[4:22] any calls whatsoever all right does
[4:25] Jesus cover it for any cause no
[4:30] and he answered and said unto them have
[4:31] you not read that he was made them at
[4:34] the beginning made them male and female
[4:37] that's it for this call shall a man
[4:38] leave father and mother and shall cleave
[4:42] to his wife and they Twain she'll be one
[4:44] flesh wherefore there are no more Twain
[4:46] but one flesh what therefore God hath
[4:49] joined together let not man put us under
[4:52] they say unto him so he kind of softened
[4:54] it down a little making you know well we
[4:58] still have some scriptures and things
[4:59] but uh you know what are you saying they
[5:03] saying to him why did Moses then command
[5:05] to give a writing a divorcement and to
[5:07] put her away if all of that you know we
[5:09] go back to the beginning
[5:11] why did he do it and he said unto them
[5:13] Moses because of the hardness of your
[5:15] hearts suffered you to put away your
[5:17] wives but from the beginning it was not
[5:19] so and I say unto you
[5:21] whosoever shall put away his wife except
[5:24] it be for fornication and shall marry
[5:27] another committest adultery and
[5:29] whosoever committeth whosoever Matt
[5:31] heard that is put away does commit
[5:33] adultery you may be seated the Lord had
[5:35] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[5:39] now
[5:40] we as I said the other day some people
[5:43] connect on and they don't know and hear
[5:46] uh
[5:48] I try to make this announcements every
[5:50] once in a while about it I'm not picking
[5:52] on anybody uh I'm trying to preach what
[5:56] I believe is the truth
[5:58] and that way then I believe the truth
[6:02] can make us free well do we really need
[6:04] to know this brother Dale well
[6:09] I believe it's necessary and beside it
[6:11] was a question given unto him in as a
[6:14] minister of the Gospel I'm Duty bound to
[6:16] try to answer those questions and a lot
[6:19] of people if you asked a lot of
[6:20] ministers that say I don't know and I
[6:23] ain't gonna get into it
[6:24] well okay that's their business but you
[6:28] know we are responsible amen
[6:31] right or wrong
[6:33] responsible for making a statements and
[6:35] doing things to do that but all right
[6:37] now
[6:39] we've tried to study there this is the
[6:42] fourth message
[6:43] and we've taken the part of the garden
[6:46] and trying to understand you know the
[6:50] things and seeing what happened in the
[6:53] garden and to do just a small amount of
[6:56] review we know that they're in Genesis
[6:59] about 313 Eve said the serpent
[7:04] beguiled me all right now we know that
[7:11] in the doing that beguiled means defiled
[7:17] and now and she lays the point to the
[7:19] serpent beguiled me
[7:22] now
[7:24] um
[7:25] if we were
[7:26] of the organized religion form of life
[7:29] for most people we would just say well
[7:31] the the you know you can R you can get
[7:33] them to discuss the regional sin being
[7:36] unbelief they'll talk with you about
[7:38] that you know they'll talk about what
[7:40] yeah sure it was unbelief
[7:42] uh you know it was disbelieving and then
[7:45] they'll go on to the carnality of of the
[7:47] attribute being an apple to eat or some
[7:50] partaking of some form but yet they
[7:54] would still even go with you on the
[7:55] point of the unbelief
[7:58] and that would be the first case of
[8:00] unbelief in the garden well that's
[8:02] that's that's fine and all but yet we're
[8:06] trying to get down to see what actually
[8:07] took place and as I was trying to cover
[8:10] on the last message then what is the
[8:13] seed of the serpent
[8:15] uh we say it was the the Beast with Eve
[8:18] well that's the seed of the Beast
[8:21] right you know that that brought the
[8:23] Natural Things of over what is the seed
[8:25] of the serpent because it speaks about
[8:27] him and said he was in the garden
[8:30] you know well then the seed of the
[8:33] serpent
[8:34] is what I tried to bring out as to be
[8:37] that he injected his thought or idea
[8:40] into Eve to get her to reason upon what
[8:45] God had promised or said you know would
[8:48] take place all right see then we've got
[8:50] to go to that to the to the Intercourse
[8:53] of the Mind
[8:55] before you can go to the Intercourse of
[8:57] the physical to do anything well that's
[9:00] you know let's hold that point so and
[9:02] you'll see a little later when I get
[9:04] down to a couple of more messages you'll
[9:06] see why we we have to lay on to that
[9:09] more uh
[9:12] you know harder to try to place a point
[9:15] to what I want to say all right because
[9:18] I asked the question about it that we
[9:22] know that polygamy came into being would
[9:23] be dealing with a little bit of that
[9:25] today but why is it that the animal was
[9:29] placed under polygamy what caused that
[9:32] you know you can understand the human
[9:34] race
[9:35] you know
[9:37] and even those who would be arguing that
[9:40] it was just unbelief or eating an apple
[9:43] they would still tell you that polygamy
[9:45] came into being throughout the Old
[9:47] Testament because it can't argue the
[9:49] point because David had you know 700
[9:51] wives Solomon had a thousand but each
[9:54] one of those was his wife and they could
[9:57] not have another husband they would go
[9:59] with you on those things
[10:01] to be able to come down to type
[10:04] Christ in the church
[10:07] but yet uh you know why is it the animal
[10:11] was placed under the polygamy
[10:14] I'm trying to hit a few points that I've
[10:16] never covered on this when I would just
[10:19] try to go through it I would just start
[10:21] out before basically what is a marriage
[10:23] and we will probably deal with that
[10:24] Wednesday or or next Sunday you know
[10:26] what is a marriage and you know and
[10:28] what's this and who can marry and who
[10:30] can to a little bit this afternoon but
[10:33] see this time I kind of picking the
[10:36] points to make you think
[10:39] not to just preach the message over
[10:41] again because you know we've been
[10:43] through those things three or four times
[10:45] in the 40 years that I've been here and
[10:48] you know doing it probably every five
[10:50] years or something down the road to try
[10:53] to help all of us but uh you know I come
[10:55] up with questions myself
[10:57] and you know one question all we've had
[11:00] was was
[11:01] you know how was Eve created any
[11:05] different
[11:06] than Adam
[11:09] you know what she made of some form that
[11:12] made her so sexually or or desirous and
[11:16] things that was that her doings well if
[11:20] it was then God created her that away
[11:22] and you got a problem if you only deal
[11:25] with that right
[11:26] but if you bring her into being as a
[11:28] perfect being as we've tried to bring
[11:31] you know not an eternal a perfect being
[11:33] standing in the garden
[11:35] then how that she could come with her
[11:39] reasoning factors
[11:41] to the spirit of man memory reason
[11:43] conscious of factions Etc Satan could
[11:45] approach her
[11:47] and through the Intercourse of her mind
[11:51] he could get her polluted see Eve was
[11:54] just as polluted standing there more in
[11:57] really sense of God and Mankind she was
[12:01] more polluted by the Intercourse of the
[12:02] Mind than she was by the physical the
[12:04] physical was just an attribute
[12:06] that's why we say and the prophet will
[12:09] tell you what sin is not ranking
[12:12] gambling smoke and run around with women
[12:13] adulteries and thought
[12:16] he said that's the attribute that's the
[12:19] display
[12:20] of what was causing the problem all
[12:23] right so then she's she's causing that
[12:26] problem by her uh intercourse of the
[12:29] mind she accepts Satan we'll get to that
[12:31] in a second
[12:33] but she said she was defiled
[12:36] beguiled
[12:39] all right
[12:40] now
[12:42] if there was not a physical connection
[12:47] I'm asking this question we'll get back
[12:49] to it in a minute
[12:50] I like to ask questions
[12:52] I love questions and answers
[12:54] I would do that every service if it
[12:57] wasn't maybe that you know you would get
[12:59] hooked up in in one or two with all it
[13:01] would be asking the questions so I like
[13:04] to ask the questions
[13:06] that way I can direct things the way I
[13:08] desire
[13:09] and my question is if there was no
[13:12] physical contact in the basis of these
[13:16] beasts the serpent uh if it was just an
[13:19] apple Etc trying to take those things
[13:21] out of some people's mind my point is
[13:24] why would the serpent
[13:29] wind up and be cursed
[13:35] I mean why would you curse him if
[13:37] if there was no connection to him
[13:40] are you listening to them and just I
[13:41] just I like questions I like to get you
[13:44] to think
[13:46] if there was no connection then why
[13:48] would you curse him
[13:51] we'll get to it in a minute I've got
[13:52] them in here and we'll read it we'll run
[13:53] around and said
[13:54] God didn't curse Adam
[13:58] all right here's another God didn't
[14:00] curse Eve
[14:02] he cursed the ground
[14:04] he cursed the serpent
[14:07] but he never cursed Adam and Eve
[14:10] all right then
[14:12] see why would it be that we would deal
[14:14] with any form if there was not some
[14:17] physical connection
[14:19] between the The Serpent and Eve
[14:25] now we went through it to see that Eve
[14:27] never received her name until the fall
[14:31] her name was woman she was taken from
[14:33] man
[14:34] and then she wants to fall came she
[14:38] became Eve which is what the mother of
[14:40] all living
[14:42] because we know that then there was a
[14:45] lineage seed
[14:47] that came down from the Beast
[14:50] and there was a lineage seed that came
[14:52] down from Adam all right we know that we
[14:55] believe it because even science says
[14:57] there's got to be something between the
[14:58] man and the monkey because they've tried
[15:00] to interrelate that you know bringing it
[15:04] together and trying to produce a child
[15:05] that won't do it but see they can't find
[15:08] that Beast right if they would even just
[15:12] go back and think about it a little amen
[15:14] and surely smart men think of these
[15:17] things but why won't they come out and
[15:20] state those forms of things I would like
[15:23] for you to if you've got a Scofield
[15:25] bible
[15:26] I don't gently go with his footnote some
[15:28] of them are good and some of them are
[15:29] not uh film I like some of them I don't
[15:32] care too much for
[15:34] uh
[15:36] let's see
[15:38] where's it at
[15:40] hang on a minute
[15:44] after serpent yeah
[15:46] if you've got a Scofield bible it'll be
[15:48] on page eight
[15:52] he's referring back to the serpent
[15:56] he says the serpent in his
[15:59] adamic
[16:03] form
[16:04] is not to be thought of as a wreathing
[16:07] or a wiggling you know
[16:09] reptile
[16:11] that is the effect of the curse right
[16:14] Genesis 3 14.
[16:17] the creature which lent himself to Satan
[16:20] May well have been the most beautiful as
[16:23] it was the most subtle of creatures less
[16:27] than man look traces of that beauty
[16:31] remain despite the curse every movement
[16:35] of a serpent is graceful and many
[16:36] species are beautifully colored
[16:39] in the serpent Satan first appeared as
[16:43] an angel of Light
[16:45] now that's just Schofield with his
[16:46] dollars
[16:48] but yet if you'd probably ask him about
[16:50] it and he'd probably still thought he
[16:51] ate he made an apple he just figured out
[16:54] the Beast gave the Apple to him because
[16:56] remember the the it says the serpent was
[16:59] the most subtle of all beasts so he was
[17:01] a beast upright creature first
[17:04] the point between man and the monkey
[17:06] that's why they can't find it the
[17:07] missing link if they've hunted far
[17:10] all right because all of the other there
[17:12] is a link between all things and we do
[17:14] not believe in the natural point of
[17:16] evolution but we we believe in creative
[17:19] evolution in that God created one higher
[17:22] than the other
[17:24] each stage coming up we believe in that
[17:27] that's that's wonderful you know but if
[17:29] you went back there and tried to see and
[17:31] find those and then Darwin would have
[17:33] just been able if he'd read the Bible
[17:35] instead of sitting out there on that
[17:36] island with his mind running
[17:38] um you know he could have done a whole
[17:41] lot of hallucinating out there and got
[17:42] all his thoughts but uh if he just sat
[17:45] down and read the Bible then he just
[17:46] said hey there he is we don't know what
[17:49] happened to him but here's the link
[17:51] but see that would have been something
[17:52] that would have made it not a mystery
[17:56] that's right and it would not you know
[17:58] as we'll read in a minute it would not
[18:00] have required a revelation amen all
[18:02] right
[18:03] but now
[18:06] think of it as I said
[18:07] if there's no physical connection with
[18:10] the natural
[18:12] between Eve and the Beast serpent ever
[18:14] how you want to relate it
[18:17] um why was he cursed what was the
[18:19] purpose
[18:20] you know I mean you you walk out
[18:22] Donnie's got a horse over there and he's
[18:24] over there and he's
[18:26] rubbing that horse and he's you know
[18:28] getting ready to ride her and you know
[18:31] he stands there and she picks up her
[18:32] foot and sets it down on his toe
[18:36] well now some of them meant to do that
[18:38] because I've been around enough animals
[18:40] to know they mean to do that you know I
[18:42] mean
[18:43] they'll they'll get you they'll kick you
[18:46] they'll do everything
[18:47] but we're just saying a natural thing
[18:49] happens when he turns around and he just
[18:51] beats the Daylights out of her
[18:56] and he you know he curses the the horse
[18:58] for stepping on his foot
[19:00] I don't mean physically I'm using that
[19:03] because of the other point of the curse
[19:04] right
[19:06] yeah why it was at the animal's fault or
[19:08] was it his fault
[19:10] even if it was Ivan hive
[19:13] there would be no reason for cursing the
[19:15] animal
[19:16] are you following me there was no reason
[19:18] to curse the serpent or beast either one
[19:22] if you're only going to go with an apple
[19:24] effect
[19:27] because the animal has no he it was no
[19:30] problem of his
[19:32] Satan was using him
[19:34] to do that
[19:36] all right now listen to what I'm saying
[19:39] the natural curse was involved
[19:42] because see Satan had already fallen out
[19:45] of heaven and he was already cursed
[19:48] so you don't have to curse him in the
[19:50] Bible you said we don't find no
[19:51] scripture where Satan is cursed
[19:53] now he started off anyway
[19:56] for what he done in the garden that's
[19:59] why when I was in the series on the the
[20:01] uh
[20:03] coming down to the Bible in Revelations
[20:05] you remember we we emphatically stated
[20:07] two or three times that uh
[20:11] Satan doesn't have to even go to the
[20:13] white throne
[20:16] he's cast into the Lake of Fire
[20:19] he doesn't have to go to the watch room
[20:22] then your Bible proves that
[20:24] because he's not a human being
[20:27] right it's not a soul involved
[20:30] the it's a spirit it's a person I mean a
[20:33] spirit but not a person all right so now
[20:36] father with me what I'm saying
[20:38] he said the serpent beguiled me
[20:44] and but God means to defile right
[20:46] serpent seed paragraph 163 these I'm
[20:49] just quoting they won't have them up
[20:51] all right
[20:54] by the Intercourse of the mind that was
[20:56] covered a while ago that Eve had to be
[20:57] first
[20:59] approached and like he said no woman can
[21:02] have intercourse with a man until she
[21:04] first accepts that in her mind
[21:07] a rape case those things those are not
[21:11] considered to be we will eventually get
[21:14] to that I I don't believe a rape case is
[21:16] any problem I believe the the girl is
[21:19] still a virgin
[21:20] now physically you can't prove that but
[21:22] spiritually I believe it because it's
[21:24] not her fault
[21:26] but when she's involved in it then it's
[21:28] her fault all right so that's paragraph
[21:31] 178 through 186 spoken words Original
[21:33] Seed we covered those Wednesday quoting
[21:36] from the scripture of second Corinthians
[21:38] 11 3 says but I fear lest that by any
[21:41] means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[21:45] through his subtility
[21:47] so your mind should be corrected from
[21:49] the Simplicity that is in Christ
[21:52] now I've never preached that scripture
[21:55] the way that I see it because when I see
[21:58] it there I see the the angels of Satan
[22:02] Delights the Ministers of the Gospel
[22:04] that the Bible speaks of as Ministers of
[22:06] righteousness but are Satan's ministers
[22:08] they are corrupting the Simplicity that
[22:11] is in Christ
[22:12] in other words they're not bringing it
[22:15] according to the word
[22:17] and by not bringing it according to the
[22:19] word they're they're corrupting it you
[22:22] know because to me when I look through
[22:24] the Bible now after the years of study I
[22:28] see Christ through every verse
[22:30] right and the prophet said if you don't
[22:32] see him in every verse go back and read
[22:34] it again he said you missed it see but
[22:36] then we turn around and try to make him
[22:37] to peoples try to make him two Lords try
[22:39] to make him all of these things and make
[22:41] him not God until the river Jordans Etc
[22:43] then we're we're corrupting the
[22:45] Simplicity that is in Christ Jesus we're
[22:48] doing exactly what happened in the
[22:50] garden
[22:51] I believe today is the day that you and
[22:53] I can be sit back and look at Satan
[22:56] doing exactly what he done in the garden
[23:00] but see what we want to do is look at it
[23:02] like this
[23:07] looking at you the yeah no no no
[23:11] you better go look in the mirror
[23:16] you mean we shaved him this morning
[23:21] you women you fixed is higher this
[23:23] morning you looking in the mirror that's
[23:26] the one you got to worry about
[23:28] because no matter what it is up here
[23:32] if you got God in your heart dire
[23:34] there's no deception can come from here
[23:37] that will take you down might pervert
[23:40] you in harmony for quite a while but
[23:42] won't be able to destroy you okay now
[23:45] just thinking of those things all right
[23:47] then we got in Wednesday night to the
[23:50] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[23:53] funny looking tree yeah
[23:56] yeah me
[23:57] funny looking tree then people want to
[24:00] end the message people especially a lot
[24:01] of them I know the quotes from Brother
[24:02] randomly gave much of them Wednesday Eve
[24:05] is a tree right but show me what run
[24:06] around and said Eve is a tree of
[24:08] knowledge
[24:09] of Good and Evil
[24:11] she's a tree you're the You're The
[24:13] Offspring of your mother you're you know
[24:15] she's a tree she brought you into being
[24:18] she reproduced the husband to bring you
[24:21] into being
[24:23] but the tree of knowledge would have to
[24:25] be in your intelligent parts of you
[24:28] because in in uh
[24:32] Strong's Concordance it says which is uh
[24:34] 1847 where it says knowledge there in
[24:37] Genesis says knowledge knowledge or
[24:40] perceptions skill
[24:42] uh discernment understanding or wisdom
[24:46] now that tree had to be a tree
[24:49] of wisdom smartness understandings Etc
[24:53] not just a tree see you're no different
[24:56] than than when you say that and placing
[24:59] Eve as to be the tree of knowledge of
[25:01] Good and Evil and the the you're you're
[25:04] no different than the denominations to
[25:06] say that it was an apple that they ate
[25:08] of
[25:10] you know
[25:11] because you're still off with the line
[25:13] of what the truth is about it right
[25:16] see the tree of knowledge of Good and
[25:17] Evil is Satan
[25:20] all right and the prophet said every
[25:22] time we take a bite off of the tree of
[25:24] knowledge now see he said we're still
[25:26] being perverted that's where it was at
[25:27] on the the the basis of Fellowship
[25:31] this past Wednesday all right
[25:33] see the tree of knowledge of Good and
[25:35] Evil
[25:37] and remember I laid a lot on this
[25:40] Wednesday night
[25:41] it was told to Adam before Eve was
[25:44] created right
[25:46] not to eat of the tree of knowledge of
[25:48] Good and Evil
[25:49] there is really no statements directly
[25:52] to Eve after she came in to be right
[25:55] right when she came into being there's
[25:57] no no scriptural statement to tell her
[26:00] to do that what the
[26:02] because that was
[26:05] said to Adam
[26:07] all right
[26:09] and being to that he said he didn't say
[26:11] now now Adam have you partaken of Eve
[26:13] when he
[26:14] come down he knew what was how what had
[26:17] happened right
[26:19] but he said Adam have you partaken of
[26:21] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[26:23] or the tree
[26:25] that I told you not to partake of
[26:29] Lee he's the one that brought death upon
[26:32] the human race
[26:35] in Adam the Bible says all die
[26:38] and he refused Eve
[26:42] there wouldn't have been any death in
[26:43] the garden in that basis there would
[26:44] have been one death that would have been
[26:46] Eve
[26:48] but yet he loved her and you can say he
[26:51] topped Christ in the basis of going out
[26:53] to bring her back be very mildly using
[26:56] the type there of Christ because you
[26:58] don't want him to be partaking of the
[27:00] wrong thing you just want a covering
[27:03] to be made so all right
[27:06] but see when you say the tree of
[27:08] knowledge of Good and Evil is Eve
[27:12] then
[27:14] so you're you're putting it back to a
[27:18] a point that I believe that it's the
[27:21] said is no more than believing an apple
[27:26] sure she was the tree
[27:29] sure Adam
[27:31] was not to partake of that tree until a
[27:34] certain time
[27:36] it's always say because you can argue
[27:38] the point
[27:40] see there are people who split churches
[27:42] and do different things over the basis
[27:44] of whether it was to be a physical
[27:45] intercourse in the garden to bring us
[27:47] into being or a creation
[27:50] I'm not going to argue with you either
[27:52] way I don't have enough time to
[27:54] because that's just irrelevant
[27:58] you can go quotes this way quote that's
[27:59] a way but it what is the point we know
[28:02] for certainty one thing the fall did
[28:04] come
[28:06] and then the prophet would say that ends
[28:09] that
[28:10] he said that ends from the beginning
[28:13] all right now when he says that he ends
[28:15] from the beginning that means there was
[28:17] no other way that could have ever come
[28:19] because God could not have displayed all
[28:21] of his attributes had there not been a
[28:24] fall in the garden right
[28:26] see so then we're looking at it in the
[28:28] correct form
[28:30] all right
[28:31] but as I said the tree of knowledge
[28:35] of Good and Evil
[28:38] the
[28:39] when
[28:41] we'll read in just a minute
[28:45] when
[28:46] God didn't curse Eve
[28:52] he said well look what he done to it no
[28:54] he didn't curse her
[28:57] now you don't have to argue with the
[28:58] prophet so it's all right man
[29:00] I don't have no trouble with I just said
[29:02] what he says
[29:04] and you just get mad at me because I
[29:05] find money saying that's always been
[29:08] funny to me you know I mean I say
[29:11] something brother Brown said and then
[29:13] you get mad because I found it well
[29:15] that's all right but now listen
[29:19] so if Eve and Adam was not cursed
[29:23] if there was no physical contact why was
[29:26] the curse of the Beast
[29:29] then it fell now watch
[29:32] and you'll tie it together just a little
[29:34] bit
[29:36] I'm saying that well I want it you'll
[29:39] tie together just a little bit of how
[29:41] come the animals fall in the situation
[29:44] no polygamy but we won't cover that for
[29:46] a few minutes
[29:48] because I'd like to get you to thinking
[29:50] in a line at least because if I am a
[29:53] teacher I'd accept a point of saying
[29:55] that I am very slow and you know and and
[29:58] keep repeating myself and that's what
[30:00] we've done in school but we did learn
[30:02] didn't we
[30:03] one plus one equals two
[30:07] the next day the teacher says what is it
[30:10] one plus one equals two the next day the
[30:13] teacher said and for 300 how many days I
[30:16] mean 150 or 60 days ever today she said
[30:19] one plus one equals two
[30:22] no matter why you say teacher at least
[30:24] get on the two plus two you know because
[30:27] you've been on that but there's one
[30:28] thing about it
[30:29] it went into the memory bank
[30:32] of your brain your mind
[30:35] and you know what then you went and went
[30:36] to outer space
[30:38] right
[30:40] when they lifted off the Earth and went
[30:42] past the moon and all into the Stars
[30:44] what was it the basis was one plus one
[30:48] equals two that's right it wasn't like
[30:52] us kids used to say say how much is one
[30:54] plus one they said eleven
[30:57] kids didn't never joke about that one
[31:00] you need to hold them up like that you
[31:02] know but now listen
[31:09] if he didn't curse Adam
[31:12] let me pull this one up right where we
[31:14] got it
[31:16] okay go ahead
[31:18] Brother Anderson I'm going to jump you
[31:21] around today all right
[31:22] pull up to one paragraph 320 set 325
[31:25] which is really 327 325 uh the future
[31:29] home preaching 64.0802
[31:33] all right he'll get it up every time I
[31:35] get through reading a little and he's
[31:36] got in there
[31:37] all right
[31:41] paragraph 325 through 327.
[31:44] but that was the closest thing see they
[31:47] they can't find that species between the
[31:50] chimpanzee and the man
[31:51] so each one is evolved up from the birds
[31:55] and on up to the monkeys and so forth up
[31:56] to the chimpanzee
[31:58] then there's a lost
[32:00] that was the serpent
[32:02] not a snake
[32:04] and reform is lost from him because he
[32:07] was cursed
[32:09] all right what
[32:11] now God didn't curse Adam
[32:14] he might have done the same thing but he
[32:17] cursed the Earth thorns and thistle
[32:20] he didn't curse Eve
[32:24] but said Adam would be her ruler from
[32:27] now on she ain't trying any preaching or
[32:29] anything Adam is her ruler and all the
[32:32] days of your life in sorrow and you'll
[32:34] bring forth bring your life into the
[32:37] Earth but he said I'll put enmity
[32:38] between your seat all right so now he
[32:41] didn't curse Adam and he didn't curse he
[32:43] but he cursed a snake
[32:45] he cursed the Beast put it on the ground
[32:47] as a crawling snake
[32:50] all right now
[32:53] you say well is that no no that wasn't
[32:56] the first creation of the snake
[32:58] because that wouldn't be Evolution
[33:00] creation
[33:02] right that wouldn't be creative
[33:03] evolution the snakes were there he just
[33:05] put him in the snakes some have inferred
[33:07] that that would be the poisonous snakes
[33:09] that's none of my business I don't
[33:11] really care he just went there anyway
[33:13] you know and uh I'm afraid of all of
[33:16] them
[33:17] yeah and and I have to say one thing for
[33:20] sure
[33:21] The Curse still is on the snake
[33:24] yeah okay
[33:28] right
[33:30] because if I find him
[33:32] you know and I know the difference in
[33:34] them so I want there's certain snakes
[33:36] we've got one up in the building our
[33:37] homes about we've got one that's five or
[33:40] six foot long and maybe this big around
[33:42] is an old chicken snake we don't kill
[33:44] him you know he's good for getting rats
[33:46] and things and and if I see a king snake
[33:49] I won't kill it I don't go around just
[33:52] killing every snack I see but if I see a
[33:54] poisonous one he doesn't have any change
[33:57] of it
[33:59] we were we were deer hunting one time
[34:01] and had this property and uh I went down
[34:03] to Sister pig and give me your stand and
[34:06] hunted one afternoon and that was the
[34:07] plan I was hunting afternoon she was a
[34:09] hunter morning she said see if anything
[34:10] was coming by for the whole day you know
[34:12] and uh so I was going down through and I
[34:16] heard something like
[34:17] foreign
[34:22] I better look around
[34:24] well I look around and
[34:26] I couldn't find no rattlesnake but we've
[34:28] got a little old snake that he's crazy
[34:30] for doing it I guess but he does it and
[34:32] that's his defense I forgot what the
[34:34] name's eraser but he'll stick up his
[34:36] tail and he'll rattle the leaves
[34:39] just like a rattlesnake
[34:41] I started to walk off because I knew it
[34:43] was not I thought Sister pig is coming
[34:44] in the morning
[34:47] if that comes out in the morning she's
[34:50] going to be scared so the old boy was
[34:52] hanging on a tree when she came in the
[34:53] next morning I told her about
[34:55] but get the point now
[34:58] he didn't curse Adam he didn't curse Eve
[35:01] he cursed a snake
[35:04] all right putting that snake in a
[35:06] position to where that there was oh
[35:12] no way to take him back right
[35:15] you understand why that you don't curse
[35:17] Adam and you don't curse Eve
[35:20] see whatever God curses is cursed
[35:22] now the world is cursed
[35:25] because it's not a soul of being apart
[35:27] but one day it will be renewed you know
[35:30] or made Eternal but it has to be totally
[35:32] burned over renovated Etc uh to be able
[35:36] to brought back but see the snake has no
[35:38] hopes whatsoever of being able to go
[35:41] back to be the Beast because he was
[35:43] cursed all right so then Satan would
[35:45] have to be cursed all the way through
[35:47] just getting a little points now watch
[35:49] then
[35:56] that alone of what we've covered
[36:00] or to say that he didn't conceive that
[36:03] he didn't curse Adam that he cursed the
[36:04] Beast should be enough to let us know
[36:06] what took place in the natural Act
[36:09] yeah Adam would go to tilling the ground
[36:12] he would go to the multiplication and
[36:16] that should show you what she'd done
[36:18] Adam falling to tilling the ground would
[36:21] be because of his part Eve because of
[36:24] her part would be the sorrows in
[36:27] childbearing right
[36:29] so that would show you what happened in
[36:31] the garden in the physical now
[36:34] whereas Eve was once co-equal
[36:38] with Adam
[36:40] right
[36:42] that's how beautiful she was made
[36:45] co-equal
[36:47] you said now she was a byproduct well
[36:50] see now what are you making about
[36:51] product
[36:52] we're going to read your Prophet said
[36:54] that she was co-equal
[36:56] so then you know you you're not you
[36:58] won't listen to it I know that you're
[36:59] not going to change people's mind I
[37:00] learned that a long time ago I used to
[37:03] think that you know if I could just walk
[37:04] down to people and just tell them that
[37:06] they would just say well that's right
[37:09] now you can tell them all you want to
[37:12] we're going to get on a quote in a
[37:13] minute from the prophet if marriage and
[37:15] divorce is not revealed and I'm going to
[37:17] say it like this I don't care if you
[37:18] were sitting there and heard it
[37:22] if it's not revealed to you
[37:27] what good is it that's right the whole
[37:29] world can read it
[37:31] is it any good for them
[37:34] no see then then get down and just think
[37:36] sensibly all right
[37:39] now so what happens
[37:41] with the fact and I want to get into
[37:43] that now and we'll get started on our
[37:44] message for this morning
[37:48] fun with the fact that Eve was created
[37:50] co-equal you know there was only one
[37:53] Covenant
[37:56] until the fall
[37:58] there wasn't two covenants when Adam was
[38:00] created and when Eve was taken from Adam
[38:03] that didn't make two Covenants
[38:06] no huh
[38:08] now when we get into that please don't
[38:10] run over to to uh Paul in his study of
[38:14] of the two covenants one from Mount
[38:16] Sinai and one from the Jerusalem which
[38:17] is above that's that's not exactly the
[38:20] covenants we're talking about
[38:21] that that would be you know you'd be
[38:24] going on over too far that's the two
[38:26] covenants Paul spoke of but that's not
[38:28] what happened in Genesis the two
[38:30] covenants all right
[38:31] but now
[38:34] before we start talking about the two
[38:36] covenants I want to just read these
[38:39] so look what the prophet says on
[38:41] paragraph 274
[38:43] 272 excuse me of marriage and divorce
[38:46] priests in 1965 221 in the morning
[38:48] service
[38:51] now under marriage and divorce it has to
[38:53] be revealed
[38:56] until it's revealed you don't know it
[39:01] now I lost contact with a man years ago
[39:03] and I always say this to illustrate how
[39:05] that preachers and people will do not
[39:07] against him he was my brother I loved
[39:09] him he's dead and I loved a man
[39:12] but I lost contact with him because I
[39:14] used to he used to eat in my home or I'd
[39:16] be at his home or or you know sometimes
[39:19] once a week
[39:21] and telephone conversations sometimes
[39:24] daily
[39:25] uh you know and discussing the message
[39:27] and preaching for him at just all kind
[39:29] of times or anytime I wanted to go by
[39:31] there I could just stop by you know
[39:34] you know
[39:35] but I was preaching on the seals and I
[39:37] said this is my revelation
[39:41] a lot of you've heard this statement but
[39:42] it's making it as a point
[39:44] he said he sent word that
[39:48] he said
[39:49] I don't have a revelation
[39:51] said you said you had a revelation
[39:53] that's wrong he said I don't have a
[39:55] revelation he said I have the Revelation
[39:57] that brother random had the revelation
[40:00] well after all that was said and done
[40:01] that was kind of carnal because I said I
[40:04] had a revelation he said he had a
[40:05] revelation both of us were saying the
[40:08] same things but I didn't ever argue with
[40:09] a man no more I just loved him and
[40:10] forgot it forget it you know
[40:13] all right
[40:15] but now listen
[40:18] if it's not revealed see what he was
[40:20] saying wrote around and said it it's
[40:22] revealed that's what most of your people
[40:24] in the message say right right what do
[40:27] you mean revealed the prophet said it
[40:29] that is the Revelation no no
[40:32] it was a revelation to him
[40:35] right
[40:38] but now when you first worked brother
[40:40] random say one God
[40:42] did you have a revelation and believe
[40:45] that run off
[40:46] no no no no no no no
[40:50] right well if it was a revelation why
[40:52] didn't you
[40:54] because you'd only be saying what he
[40:56] says
[40:57] the Bible says no man can call Jesus or
[40:59] say that Christ is a curse except what
[41:03] by the Holy Ghost himself okay see it
[41:06] has to be revealed until it's revealed
[41:08] you don't know it but he promised in the
[41:10] last days
[41:12] why didn't Paul and all of them
[41:16] preach about marriage and divorce very
[41:18] much or the serpent seed or the the
[41:20] things
[41:22] I thought it would be the last day
[41:24] where would it be at in this age where
[41:28] we're at that every hidden Mystery in
[41:30] the Bible will be revealed how many
[41:32] knows that Revelations the 10th chapter
[41:34] Jesus Promised it that all of these
[41:36] hidden mysteries on on marriage and
[41:38] divorce and all these other Hidden
[41:41] Mysteries that's been revealed would be
[41:43] revealed in the end time now where did
[41:45] he say it come from he goes on to the
[41:47] seventh angel number two where did he
[41:49] say it come from which is from marriage
[41:51] and divorce paragraph 311
[41:54] where did it come from
[41:56] God bore me witness on that on the
[41:59] mountain that I could say this a
[42:01] supernatural Revelation because of the
[42:03] opening of The Seven Seals and this is a
[42:05] question in God's word
[42:07] let them go on in as they are and sin no
[42:11] more
[42:13] Supernatural Revelation has God revealed
[42:16] to you
[42:19] that that is your wife
[42:22] but that is your husband
[42:25] as he revealed
[42:28] all right then if it's been revealed
[42:31] see then there's no way of of uh
[42:34] breaking that
[42:36] you see why I say it this way and I know
[42:38] it's Natural praying carnal but you know
[42:41] I never have after I come in the message
[42:43] and heard what the prophet had to say
[42:44] about it and things and and how he
[42:46] placed things together you know I've
[42:48] never worried about my wife running
[42:49] around on me
[42:53] I mean not more than one reasons
[42:57] first off she's Christian she would have
[42:58] done it so that means she's not a
[42:59] Christian she died
[43:01] all right so she needs to get straight
[43:04] well second off if she's going to make
[43:05] it in she's gonna have to come back and
[43:06] tell me about it it's going to be
[43:08] straighten it up somewhere
[43:10] so I don't have to worry about it
[43:12] right
[43:14] you say well that's a funny way I love
[43:16] my wife's a reason because that's
[43:18] cornelling
[43:20] he said well these are not trust you I
[43:22] love her well I
[43:23] a lot of people love women that and Men
[43:26] you know different things it
[43:28] didn't solve a lot of problems right
[43:31] right okay
[43:34] so now what do we got
[43:40] something that's got to be revealed
[43:44] have you asked God to reveal to you
[43:47] marriage and divorce
[43:49] no I was sitting there when he said it
[43:53] wonderful
[43:54] but did God drop down to you
[43:58] speak it
[44:02] may I say that what they say about the
[44:04] future home that when brother Branham
[44:06] came out he said I can count on Billy
[44:08] Paul or something did you get it yeah
[44:10] Daddy I got it or something like that
[44:11] you know something going on he said I
[44:13] count on my hand how many got it
[44:18] and also I heard last night where sister
[44:19] Freda she's not here all right they said
[44:23] that brother Perry green coughed up that
[44:25] cancer that was down in his throat or
[44:27] something and it was like a spider that
[44:29] was spitting out of him and I prayed to
[44:30] God I believe you know that God is still
[44:32] the Healer and I know he had been real
[44:35] sick now I'm quoting from Sister Freda
[44:37] that got her information from somebody
[44:39] else and I pray that that God I still
[44:41] believe he's a Healer I I do that I
[44:45] don't have any problems all right but
[44:48] now listen
[44:49] I'll read in a minute
[44:51] where brother Brown was a saying that
[44:53] she in such a high place how could she
[44:56] do what she done
[44:59] you realize what co-equal means
[45:05] is there any sinful situation could be
[45:07] encounted in between Adam and Eve in the
[45:10] beginning and it would be calling
[45:12] co-equal
[45:13] foreign
[45:16] form of sinful situation
[45:20] whatever you want to think about
[45:23] don't make them co-equal sinners
[45:25] let's don't go that way okay
[45:30] how could she be co-equal
[45:34] and her be created wrong
[45:37] that's that's just all I want to know
[45:39] I'm full of questions
[45:43] because look what your Prophet had to
[45:45] say
[45:46] and you say well now we know about the
[45:48] two covenants but what about the first
[45:49] Covenant
[45:51] go ahead brother number three
[45:53] think of a marriage divorce program 195
[45:55] 194 excuse me 65 221
[46:00] the morning
[46:02] now notice after the fall Jesus said
[46:05] beginning
[46:07] made one of a kind but now after the
[46:10] fall
[46:11] now we're going beyond that
[46:13] and watch
[46:14] the Covenant was co-equal right
[46:18] so with only one Covenant
[46:22] but now after the fall there is another
[46:25] covenant made
[46:29] now she was no longer a ruler with him
[46:31] each must have a separate Covenant
[46:39] now
[46:41] first it was just one Covenant koiqua
[46:45] let's read the next one before I make my
[46:47] comments back up go ahead to number four
[46:49] paragraph 104 marriage and divorce
[46:53] why did she do such a thing being in
[46:56] that high order
[46:59] she was right with man
[47:01] co-equal with him
[47:04] we've all known now that she lost her
[47:06] co-equaleness with man when she sinned
[47:09] and God said man will be your ruler from
[47:11] here on here out now that's the
[47:14] scripture all right
[47:17] but now think about it
[47:21] she was co-equal
[47:25] no sinful situation whatsoever
[47:30] but then
[47:32] he had to make another Covenant
[47:36] we'll read in a second where he says one
[47:38] with a product and one with a byproduct
[47:40] so then you develop into what B that's
[47:42] the title of the message today two
[47:44] Covenants
[47:45] but as I said let's don't go over now in
[47:48] the two covenants to Paul dealing with
[47:51] the the people there in the scriptures
[47:53] and all I got written somewhere in here
[47:55] don't go over there trying to talk about
[47:57] the two Covenants
[47:58] because you got one from Mount Sinai
[48:00] which is the law and then you got the
[48:03] other one from
[48:04] from uh Heavenly Jerusalem which is from
[48:07] above so don't go into that form of two
[48:09] covenants keep it back in the garden
[48:10] where we're at now two Covenants
[48:16] a double Covenant he says a separate
[48:19] Covenant
[48:21] now
[48:23] I want to ask you a simple question
[48:29] is there one way for a woman to be saved
[48:32] and another way for the man to be saved
[48:38] and that's what it sounds like doesn't
[48:40] it because it sounds like just two
[48:41] covenants when you don't express it you
[48:43] just read it it sounds like two
[48:45] Covenants
[48:47] and he's not explaining these things as
[48:49] much
[48:50] because he's got a lengthy message to
[48:53] preach
[48:55] well yet he says two Covenants
[49:00] I Covenant with her and a covenant with
[49:01] him
[49:04] well I thought there was only one
[49:05] Covenant of salvation
[49:10] right there would be man woman Jew
[49:12] Gentile who whatever there's only one
[49:15] Covenant of salvation
[49:18] there's not two Covenants
[49:20] it's not the woman got her special way
[49:22] and the man got his special way and
[49:25] we're all
[49:26] Born Again amen
[49:29] brought into the Covenant of Christ by
[49:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost whether it
[49:32] be male or female right so get that part
[49:36] out of your mind
[49:37] and it'll help you to understand what's
[49:39] really being said
[49:41] that you're not talking about the
[49:43] prophet is not talking about the
[49:45] salvation of a soul
[49:47] or how to be saved
[49:50] he said well brother Dale I can take you
[49:52] over and okay go ahead and run over all
[49:53] you want to you're going to come back
[49:55] where I'm at
[49:57] because you say I can go to the to the
[49:59] invisible Union where she's got this and
[50:01] that's right we'll get to that wonderful
[50:03] that is but that's something natural
[50:11] the Bible says Jonah 2 9.
[50:13] oh
[50:15] me
[50:16] there's only one salvation
[50:20] salvation to the Lord
[50:23] that's why I said to start with marriage
[50:25] and divorce
[50:27] won't send you to hell
[50:32] because whatever you make out of it is
[50:34] an attribute
[50:36] on the physical side
[50:38] they won't send you to hell
[50:43] but blaspheme in the Holy Ghost will
[50:47] what if blaspheming the Holy Ghost the
[50:49] prophet said it's attributing the works
[50:51] of God to the devil that's right amen
[50:54] so if you sat down and frown up and you
[50:56] say
[51:01] blaspheme and Holy Ghost go ahead
[51:05] do what you want to do
[51:08] that's your choice
[51:12] well God I don't believe I didn't say
[51:13] God you didn't believe it like I believe
[51:15] it
[51:16] if you don't believe what the Bible says
[51:18] and the prophet says
[51:19] and that's unbelief
[51:23] now questions about this no problems
[51:27] there's no problems with questions about
[51:28] God's word that's not blaspheming the
[51:31] Holy Ghost
[51:33] you realize what he's just saying
[51:34] they're tripping in the works of God to
[51:35] the devil in other words you said the
[51:37] devil said that the devil's done that
[51:39] the devil taught that the devil made him
[51:40] do that when it was God
[51:47] you better be careful in marriage and
[51:48] divorce because you've got a lot of
[51:49] things to cover that is really stressing
[51:52] upon the human mind
[51:54] God told the prophet one day to go marry
[51:57] a prostitute
[51:58] and have children by her right
[52:02] I think she run off and left him I
[52:05] believe it's right he went back and got
[52:06] her again
[52:09] you won't try to explain that I'm not
[52:12] that's one of the things I won't tackle
[52:13] because it's not been revealed to me
[52:15] I'll talk about anything that's been
[52:17] revealed
[52:19] but when it ain't revealed I leave that
[52:21] alone
[52:22] but I just know it's dark
[52:27] you tell me that how that
[52:29] brother Brown said Bathsheba was made
[52:31] for David now you tell me about that and
[52:34] I don't know
[52:35] that's what he's saying
[52:40] okay
[52:42] got a lot of questions
[52:44] just go over what the Lord's revealed to
[52:46] what we have
[52:47] all right
[52:49] so then it's not talking about
[52:52] a covenant of salvation for the woman
[52:54] and a covenant of salvation for the man
[52:57] all are saved by the blood of Jesus
[52:59] Christ all are saved by uh an indwelling
[53:03] of the spirit of almighty God into our
[53:05] souls to make us Eternal beings
[53:09] and you don't find in the Old Testament
[53:11] anywhere uh sacrifice is separate that
[53:14] that the woman had to make except
[53:19] for her purification
[53:22] so that shows you where the curse went
[53:23] see
[53:24] all right
[53:26] but it's still not salvation
[53:29] you know everybody understand me where I
[53:31] can move on
[53:32] what do you believe what I believe or
[53:33] not that's all right I don't ask you to
[53:35] believe it I ask you to consider it
[53:38] right
[53:39] salvation is based upon the blood of
[53:42] Jesus Christ not upon the basis of what
[53:45] we do in the flesh or haven't done we're
[53:49] not saved because we're so goody goody
[53:51] but we're neither safe because we're so
[53:53] bad
[53:54] we're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:56] all right salvation
[53:59] but now what's these two covenants then
[54:04] what is these two Covenants
[54:09] what do you think about it
[54:13] where once it was just one Covenant and
[54:14] they were co-equal
[54:18] then
[54:19] another Covenant comes into being
[54:25] equal and it's automatically it says to
[54:27] the woman that you were under your
[54:29] husband and he'll rule over you
[54:38] two Covenants
[54:43] go ahead with number five paragraph 195
[54:45] 198 excuse me when I'd eat 199 of
[54:49] marriage and divorce
[54:52] two Covenants
[54:54] now that closes the beginning in other
[54:56] words in back there in the beginning
[54:59] when he created man and woman equal one
[55:01] Covenant fall closes that no way to get
[55:05] back finished now you got two Covenants
[55:08] all right what are those two Covenants
[55:14] two covenants now that closes the
[55:16] beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't
[55:17] so at the beginning we got another
[55:20] notice it's another Covenant now there's
[55:23] a covenant for the product
[55:25] and the byproduct
[55:27] notice the fall brought trouble death to
[55:29] every creature of the creation making a
[55:32] difference in all nature
[55:35] now let us notice what Jesus said about
[55:37] it from the beginning it wasn't so
[55:40] now it is not so from
[55:44] it is now
[55:46] it is after the beginning
[55:49] now there is a double Covenant
[55:53] first was just a covenant
[55:55] Adam and Eve was co-equal one man one
[55:58] woman another woman sinned and what does
[56:00] she do that drove them all to death and
[56:03] God had to make a covenant by that
[56:05] another Covenant
[56:07] here it is right here in Genesis 3 16 he
[56:11] made another Covenant all right
[56:14] now
[56:21] but random knew about these a lot of
[56:24] these things back in his early Ministry
[56:27] you get in conduct order and Doctrine
[56:29] especially and he'll say the Lord has
[56:32] made ways in places like this before you
[56:35] know he's stating things
[56:38] but he can't come out and preach on it
[56:40] but he knows on back in his early
[56:41] Ministry some things so let's read a
[56:44] couple of them
[56:46] 64 was marriage and divorce right
[56:49] 65 excuse me all right looking 63 number
[56:52] six the evening messenger 63 11 A 1 16.
[56:57] paragraph 308 309 306 307.
[57:03] look what he says
[57:06] then you'll begin to develop an idea and
[57:09] I see right now I'm going to not get
[57:11] through these two covenants this morning
[57:12] no problem
[57:16] the Bible said it's a shame for a man to
[57:18] have long hair
[57:21] looks like a woman
[57:23] God made two
[57:28] now watch you
[57:33] one with Adam
[57:35] one with Eve
[57:38] he dressed him different
[57:40] they're different all together
[57:43] they're almost always been different
[57:45] there's two covenants right on down
[57:47] through the Bible
[57:49] I'd like to preach on that double
[57:50] Covenant one night sometimes show you
[57:53] what the difference is
[57:55] oh my is tremendous
[57:59] it's even in your marriage and divorce
[58:03] so now you say well what's higher and
[58:05] clothes Got to Do with It
[58:12] okay
[58:13] it's tremendous that even in your
[58:15] marriage and divorce case if you only
[58:17] knew the truth on that would settle that
[58:19] whole matter that's right all right
[58:20] again now while we be sure now come
[58:23] won't you
[58:25] talking about her and clothes
[58:33] and he's tying it to the two Covenants
[58:36] of marriage and divorce
[58:42] okay going to the next one
[58:47] from that time
[58:50] E90
[58:51] 62 713
[58:56] talking about women and their privilege
[58:58] they were doing and forcing the rights
[59:00] and I
[59:01] say I can dress the way I want to it's
[59:04] none of your business
[59:08] it's not me brother sister it's the
[59:10] Bible
[59:12] God made a man
[59:14] and he made him dress like a man
[59:17] and he made a woman to dress like a
[59:18] woman
[59:20] made them act different
[59:23] and made two covenants with them
[59:26] and everything else always been
[59:30] now find me any word in the message that
[59:32] he speaks
[59:34] the double Covenant form and puts it to
[59:37] be
[59:37] salvation
[59:40] as I tried to express a moment ago
[59:49] he's not cursed
[59:53] Adam is not cursed
[59:57] a double Covenant
[59:59] appears because of the Fall
[1:00:05] both of them have an opportunity to be
[1:00:07] saved
[1:00:08] by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:13] but you see we haven't been taught that
[1:00:16] it was wrong to do things
[1:00:19] that's why like my wife will always tell
[1:00:21] you there's one thing for sure
[1:00:23] if you've come here as much as five
[1:00:25] years you've heard marriage and divorce
[1:00:29] any of you girls and boys don't have no
[1:00:31] excuse
[1:00:33] we even had a discussion one time with
[1:00:35] the girls and
[1:00:36] my wife and I took them and sat down
[1:00:39] with them and talked with him about
[1:00:43] what marriages were and what things were
[1:00:45] was going to get to the boys we never
[1:00:46] did get to see them I guess we need to
[1:00:48] go now and get them but
[1:00:52] you don't have an excuse you here you
[1:00:54] don't you don't say well well we don't
[1:00:55] know brother that we haven't been taught
[1:00:58] this maybe some of you that had come
[1:01:00] later
[1:01:00] you you've never been probably taught
[1:01:03] marriage and divorce
[1:01:07] you've never been taught that a boy and
[1:01:09] girl should do nothing but even they
[1:01:11] shouldn't even hold hands and things
[1:01:12] until they're engaged
[1:01:15] and no kissing until the wedding takes
[1:01:17] place the veil lifted
[1:01:20] we went through that we will go through
[1:01:22] it again
[1:01:26] you see because I've tried to explain to
[1:01:27] you
[1:01:30] and how many girls in here could say
[1:01:32] you've never kissed my boy
[1:01:36] you know somebody other than your
[1:01:37] husband
[1:01:39] I had to raise our hands on that one
[1:01:41] time and
[1:01:42] and I said it in a way that was you know
[1:01:45] boys and girls is dating dude and I only
[1:01:48] had one couple here that said that they
[1:01:50] never kissed until they were married now
[1:01:52] I'll have to answer this honestly they
[1:01:54] didn't say they never kissed anybody
[1:01:56] else because I didn't ask that question
[1:01:59] I was asking if they had not kissed me
[1:02:02] by dating you know all right
[1:02:06] that's why there's a lot of things that
[1:02:08] jump when you come to me and want to
[1:02:10] know about getting married we have a lot
[1:02:11] of discussions about things
[1:02:13] but it's only for the basis of trying to
[1:02:16] be right
[1:02:17] I'm not trying to be Lord over I'm
[1:02:20] trying to be right
[1:02:22] and I'm trying to get you to be right
[1:02:24] well then if there is no hopes with the
[1:02:26] grace of marriage and divorce then we
[1:02:28] must rule that to be the major factor of
[1:02:31] our lives and must gain ground towards
[1:02:33] that but can you can you receive the
[1:02:35] grace of marriage and divorce if it's
[1:02:37] not revealed to you
[1:02:40] that that's the only question I have
[1:02:44] go to that way you can just go over here
[1:02:45] to the neighbor and say marriage and
[1:02:47] divorce have been preached you believe
[1:02:48] brother Brown was a prophet everything's
[1:02:49] okay
[1:02:52] now he said to my followers only
[1:02:56] don't tell your neighbors about marriage
[1:02:57] and divorce come on Lulu we'll get you
[1:02:59] straightened out now you come up here
[1:03:01] you're going to find out how bad we are
[1:03:04] you can't take this to the world
[1:03:09] you can't do that church it's not for
[1:03:12] the world it's for the Believers only
[1:03:15] all right
[1:03:18] and the Believers in this message only
[1:03:21] all right
[1:03:25] so let's think about what he's saying
[1:03:28] and he said that
[1:03:30] where do we read that
[1:03:33] he gave the scripture well we want to
[1:03:36] look at number
[1:03:41] and let me read a little bit look at
[1:03:42] number eight
[1:03:44] you'll find this is about five
[1:03:45] paragraphs of marriage and divorce
[1:03:50] there we go
[1:03:53] so remember as we're starting on the
[1:03:56] talk the two Covenants
[1:03:59] the you're thinking about what are you
[1:04:01] doing brother Dale I'm trying my best to
[1:04:03] figure out a way to say things
[1:04:04] to where you can understand it and it
[1:04:06] follows the correct way so if I pause
[1:04:08] and wait that's just the old human mind
[1:04:10] I ain't that smart
[1:04:14] sometimes if we didn't run our mouth so
[1:04:16] much we might be able to you know we've
[1:04:18] got two ears and one mouth
[1:04:21] right what does that mean
[1:04:25] twice as much listening as there is run
[1:04:29] in the mouth
[1:04:30] right okay
[1:04:34] now if I don't get through with this
[1:04:35] we'll come back to it but the main point
[1:04:36] I want you to get because he gives you
[1:04:38] the scriptures
[1:04:40] all right
[1:04:41] so this would be paragraph 194 and it'll
[1:04:43] go all the way up to 200 or something
[1:04:46] of marriage and divorce preaching 65 to
[1:04:50] 21 in the morning service now notice now
[1:04:53] after the fall after the beginning After
[1:04:55] Time begin back in the eternity it was a
[1:04:59] eternity back and that was eternity is
[1:05:02] over
[1:05:03] notice after that fall was made by Eve
[1:05:06] after the fall there was a need to be
[1:05:07] another covenant made
[1:05:09] now this is going to stumble you but I'm
[1:05:11] going to give you the scripture to prove
[1:05:13] that this is the truth
[1:05:15] now notice after the fall Jesus said God
[1:05:17] at the beginning made one of a kind but
[1:05:20] now after the fall now we're going
[1:05:21] beyond that the Covenant was co-equal
[1:05:24] but now after the fall there is another
[1:05:26] covenant made now she is no longer ruler
[1:05:31] with him
[1:05:35] are we right now she's no longer ruler
[1:05:40] with him
[1:05:47] each must have a separate Covenant
[1:05:53] I'm going to stop there because I go any
[1:05:54] further
[1:05:55] I'm going to tie up a lot of things okay
[1:05:59] let me just preach a minute and then
[1:06:00] we'll
[1:06:01] we'll end it
[1:06:05] so the two covenants is not
[1:06:08] the Mount Sinai eye Paul
[1:06:12] which is Hagar
[1:06:14] and you know the Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:06:17] it's not that Covenant
[1:06:20] all right the two covenants in the
[1:06:22] garden
[1:06:25] if he didn't curse Adam
[1:06:28] and he didn't curse Eve
[1:06:31] then are you dealing with a death
[1:06:34] situation
[1:06:38] that's the point I want you to look at
[1:06:42] why didn't he just kill Eve
[1:06:45] now of course we got it in the message
[1:06:47] how come
[1:06:50] you know they got into the message that
[1:06:52] Adam grabbed Eve and throwed her on the
[1:06:53] ground and had intercourse with her and
[1:06:55] that saved her
[1:07:00] if that's true Brother Gary let's go
[1:07:02] back down on 10th Street and start over
[1:07:04] again right with the hippies with all of
[1:07:06] the doings
[1:07:10] some of you don't like the way I talk
[1:07:13] but I'm sorry
[1:07:14] at least I get you to think
[1:07:17] some of you think this old boy don't
[1:07:19] know what he's talking about
[1:07:22] how many of you've ever looked up
[1:07:24] polygamy to see what it means
[1:07:39] we got a little bit to look at this
[1:07:41] afternoon so we'll hold that point
[1:07:43] but if you ever just looked at it to see
[1:07:45] what it means
[1:07:47] I said it meant only for
[1:07:51] a man with more than one wife
[1:07:53] I got the Bible now what do you got
[1:08:00] he said not just male or female
[1:08:01] I know what the word polygamy means
[1:08:09] but I got the Bible what do you got
[1:08:17] did Eve have more than one
[1:08:19] husband
[1:08:21] yes
[1:08:23] because she had two different partners
[1:08:27] which does not have to be recognized as
[1:08:31] marriage is according to the law
[1:08:36] I'm quoting
[1:08:38] Wikipedia
[1:08:44] all right so we'll listen this afternoon
[1:08:46] give you something to think about
[1:08:51] but think about it now for a second
[1:08:55] if God didn't curse Adam and he didn't
[1:08:58] curse Eve
[1:09:00] then why is so much damnation preached
[1:09:04] against women
[1:09:08] right that old byproduct one you gave to
[1:09:12] me
[1:09:14] I told you I don't like jokes
[1:09:16] I like jokes that are good clean fun yes
[1:09:19] listen to them take last night wrote
[1:09:21] around and said you know God even had a
[1:09:23] sense of humor
[1:09:27] was sin okay good but he said God's got
[1:09:30] a sense of humor now you tell God he
[1:09:31] sinned
[1:09:33] you remember when he said Jesus said
[1:09:35] that now go tell that fox
[1:09:38] there was some joke about Herod being
[1:09:40] called a fox Jesus knew the joke and he
[1:09:42] said it
[1:09:43] but you see that's where we just take a
[1:09:44] quote we eat ourselves to death by it
[1:09:50] but if it was no curse put on Adam and
[1:09:52] no curse put on Eve
[1:09:56] you know cursed cursed means destroyed
[1:09:59] or annihilated
[1:10:01] something that's cursed
[1:10:04] now you want scripture how can you
[1:10:08] curse what God has blessed
[1:10:11] is that scripture
[1:10:14] right
[1:10:20] so the curse was placed upon the snake
[1:10:24] serpent
[1:10:26] but not on Adam and Eve
[1:10:29] if it depend on Adam and Eve
[1:10:32] they would have both been destroyed at
[1:10:34] that time
[1:10:36] because whatever you want to take
[1:10:38] whatever you want to do however how much
[1:10:40] you want to try to preach that Adam was
[1:10:42] not deceived that makes him that much
[1:10:44] worse
[1:10:45] because he partook of the ACT physically
[1:10:48] knowing amen what would take place now
[1:10:52] you argue that point right
[1:10:56] he knew what was going to take place
[1:11:01] that's why the Bible says in Adam all
[1:11:04] die
[1:11:05] doesn't say an eve
[1:11:07] but he won't blame me for everything
[1:11:11] right
[1:11:14] sure
[1:11:16] she done what she done
[1:11:21] my brother Brandon said on one side she
[1:11:23] is the the example of everything vulgar
[1:11:26] and and all but he said on the other
[1:11:27] side said she's the example of all
[1:11:29] things that are pure and true
[1:11:31] a good wife
[1:11:33] is a good wife
[1:11:36] hey I know
[1:11:39] I can understand a lot of things but
[1:11:42] you know there were some good women back
[1:11:44] there in the Bible
[1:11:49] right
[1:11:51] there was some real good women back
[1:11:54] there
[1:11:59] and some of those husbands love those
[1:12:01] women they were good women
[1:12:03] but some of them
[1:12:05] you know done what that wife said
[1:12:07] sometimes
[1:12:09] got them all messed up
[1:12:12] see everybody just thinks a woman is a
[1:12:14] garbage can you know to an Israelite a
[1:12:16] woman is a secondary product
[1:12:20] if you think they don't know what the
[1:12:21] fall is why is it
[1:12:30] and see the people of this message
[1:12:32] preach that there's no salvation for
[1:12:34] women outside of having a head
[1:12:39] meaning physically
[1:12:41] you never heard a preach on it
[1:12:44] you must have been asleep
[1:12:52] her husband her head
[1:12:58] but if her daddy's dead and her
[1:13:00] husband's dead she's got one head and
[1:13:01] that's God
[1:13:03] if she's a true Christian
[1:13:07] and she's doing what's right
[1:13:11] see the years when we get out none of
[1:13:12] that headship but the point is thinking
[1:13:15] Adam and Eve wasn't cursed to death
[1:13:18] they didn't have dialed right to her
[1:13:20] the day you eat thereof that day you'll
[1:13:22] die which means they didn't live a
[1:13:23] thousand years because
[1:13:25] God had done said that
[1:13:31] but you know Adam and Eve wasn't lost
[1:13:34] right
[1:13:37] oh you can take that about Adam can't
[1:13:39] you
[1:13:43] well why is it that Adam got a skin to
[1:13:46] put on
[1:13:49] why didn't Eve just get the skin
[1:13:56] I like for you to think
[1:14:03] Adam partook
[1:14:05] knowing what he was doing yes
[1:14:09] and that put the whole human race under
[1:14:11] sin
[1:14:14] we don't want to blame Adam we don't
[1:14:16] blame the woman
[1:14:18] well you know she wasn't cursed that's
[1:14:20] what you get you get the preacher's a
[1:14:21] message you listen you you got cursed
[1:14:23] women everywhere that's
[1:14:25] oh now there's a certain line there now
[1:14:27] if y'all keep that line pretty straight
[1:14:28] right down that line right there y'all
[1:14:30] maybe you'll not be able to be saved now
[1:14:32] show me in the Bible where there's a
[1:14:34] certain line for a woman to be saved and
[1:14:35] a certain line for the man to be saved
[1:14:39] right uh we're going to get into some
[1:14:42] questions one of these days
[1:14:46] you know Paul
[1:14:48] maybe sometimes it's hard to be
[1:14:50] understood
[1:14:53] but you know Paul spoke of a man having
[1:14:55] a virginity
[1:15:00] as well as a woman
[1:15:09] but it's not said about him
[1:15:11] just read the next paragraph
[1:15:18] the next paragraph says
[1:15:23] he has to marry a virgin
[1:15:28] now you are self-interpreting
[1:15:38] no man has a right to marry a woman
[1:15:40] that's not a virgin
[1:15:44] oh Abigail
[1:15:49] only after her husband was dead
[1:15:58] this thing lays so close until what did
[1:16:00] the prophet say he said it's even into
[1:16:04] Heathen race
[1:16:06] when that King will get to it eventually
[1:16:09] that's right
[1:16:12] as quick as he found out that that was
[1:16:14] Abraham's wife
[1:16:16] but he immediately run back with her
[1:16:19] and said I was deceived the Lord said I
[1:16:23] know you would that's why I didn't kill
[1:16:24] you
[1:16:28] but you see we thank the man he can just
[1:16:30] go out and do what he wants to
[1:16:37] but see neither one of them was cursed
[1:16:39] if they can't be saved
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:43] right
[1:16:48] because he's not talking about a double
[1:16:50] Covenant being you know two covenants
[1:16:52] being
[1:16:54] two different ways of being saved
[1:16:57] I'll say this words in any end y'all
[1:16:59] come ahead musicians
[1:17:01] we'll be dealing this afternoon with the
[1:17:04] manner of life
[1:17:06] because there's your double Covenant
[1:17:11] I gave you the reasons and that
[1:17:17] man for
[1:17:19] woman cutting her hair
[1:17:24] man's supposed to have short hair and
[1:17:26] woman first half long hair
[1:17:28] supposed to dress different he said
[1:17:30] that's the double Covenant
[1:17:32] he showed you right there I want the
[1:17:34] double Covenant would be not that Eve
[1:17:36] was so lustful and Adam was so beautiful
[1:17:39] wonderful
[1:17:44] right
[1:17:46] you know what brother Dale I want to
[1:17:47] know this out the other get on down
[1:17:48] there we get on down there we got to go
[1:17:51] here first
[1:17:52] right all right
[1:17:54] sisters are going preparing for the
[1:17:56] lunch together
[1:18:00] I thank God he's given me
[1:18:05] 73 years
[1:18:10] three years above what I've promised
[1:18:15] so I'm on vacation
[1:18:18] I'm on borrowed time
[1:18:20] he didn't know it to me
[1:18:23] some of you may say I wish it had took
[1:18:25] him in the 70s so I went out to put up
[1:18:26] with him but that's all right
[1:18:31] you may not like my former's preaching
[1:18:34] or ways but there's one thing about it
[1:18:35] when it's finished
[1:18:37] we got something to stand on
[1:18:40] there's never been challenged
[1:18:43] by anyone out there
[1:18:47] to say you're wrong
[1:18:50] and that's a statement now that you say
[1:18:52] well
[1:18:53] are you arrogant or hateful no I'm just
[1:18:55] truthful
[1:18:58] because if you put down the word in the
[1:19:00] correct order
[1:19:03] they won't say nothing to you now
[1:19:05] they'll go around the corner and talk
[1:19:06] all they want to and that's all right
[1:19:08] he'll get out there and just blah blah
[1:19:10] blah blah you know brother devils are
[1:19:11] all messed up
[1:19:13] but you know what if the man paid me a
[1:19:15] compliment one time
[1:19:19] he told me he said I heard two brothers
[1:19:21] talking
[1:19:22] about you brother Dale I said what
[1:19:25] he said
[1:19:27] one of them said you said so and so
[1:19:32] he said I told him you didn't say it
[1:19:40] he said God I know you
[1:19:43] and I know you wouldn't say that
[1:19:45] I said thank you brother
[1:19:47] that was a compliment
[1:19:49] the fact that he knowed I wouldn't say
[1:19:51] it
[1:19:55] you just think about brother Branham
[1:19:57] standing there
[1:19:59] and Billy Paul coming to him and said
[1:20:01] Daddy
[1:20:03] will you marry me in Lois he says no
[1:20:10] they got married somewhere by somebody
[1:20:13] and there's no record that brother
[1:20:15] random didn't go to the wedding you say
[1:20:17] there's no record he did okay we're
[1:20:18] standing 50 50. no problem
[1:20:27] right
[1:20:31] he was the one that got it in all for
[1:20:33] that girl you know
[1:20:35] but then he turned around and he said
[1:20:36] that's a wedding
[1:20:40] but did he condemn Billy to hell
[1:20:44] or call him an adulteress and he called
[1:20:46] lost an adulteress for marrying him that
[1:20:49] would make two wives
[1:20:52] no
[1:20:58] don't you think he felt good when God
[1:20:59] told him the truth of marriage and
[1:21:01] divorce
[1:21:03] told them to go on as they are
[1:21:10] because he's seen his own son
[1:21:14] this is serious it's not play matters
[1:21:17] he said well what does it do to our
[1:21:19] Salvation it may not have nothing to do
[1:21:21] with the point of whether you're born
[1:21:22] again or not but
[1:21:25] this thing here that you're looking at
[1:21:27] is involved
[1:21:30] of course if we believe like everybody
[1:21:32] in the message tries to believe you're
[1:21:33] going to get you a new body a different
[1:21:35] one well I guess that's okey dokey throw
[1:21:37] it away let's get us another one
[1:21:39] but if we're going to believe what the
[1:21:40] prophet said he didn't believe in that
[1:21:42] right
[1:21:46] now how can you be that carnal in your
[1:21:48] mind if you don't see Satan
[1:21:51] in his subtility like he was in the
[1:21:54] garden approaching your mind
[1:21:57] the way he did there
[1:22:00] why in the world would a preacher get up
[1:22:01] in the pulpit and say I'm going to get
[1:22:02] me a new body I'm going to throw this in
[1:22:04] a way
[1:22:07] when the prophet said Resurrection is
[1:22:09] not replacement
[1:22:11] he said Jesus come up with the same body
[1:22:13] went down in
[1:22:17] but I believe the prophet and everything
[1:22:19] he said you
[1:22:24] know I believe Satan is still in the
[1:22:25] simplicity
[1:22:28] let's Stand Together
[1:22:30] that's just saying a verse while we're
[1:22:31] waiting on the
[1:22:33] what we got waiting on their sister to
[1:22:34] get ready for us to go eat together I
[1:22:37] invite you to come eat my birthday of
[1:22:39] course you had to cook it
[1:22:52] in my
[1:23:02] room
[1:23:32] wow
[1:24:08] person
[1:24:19] thank you
[1:24:29] you ever got down to you just didn't
[1:24:31] know what to say and how to pray and
[1:24:34] a burden on your heart
[1:24:36] then they start singing it to him
[1:24:43] in your relationships
[1:25:34] good morning
[1:25:50] me my
[1:25:56] mother
[1:26:02] 's day
[1:26:49] come on
[1:26:57] wow
[1:27:02] always
[1:27:05] foreign
[1:27:16] a double Covenant
[1:27:18] but he's not talking about salvation
[1:27:24] so it must mean something in this life
[1:27:31] you ready
[1:27:32] all right let's think of that something
[1:27:35] in this life
[1:27:40] there was only one Covenant in the
[1:27:42] beginning
[1:27:45] there'll only be one Covenant
[1:27:47] in glory that's right
[1:27:55] Regional Covenant was correct
[1:28:00] an obeyed a way to be in heaven
[1:28:05] and what about it
[1:28:07] father we thank you for this day and
[1:28:09] what we've tried to say Lord
[1:28:11] just help us in understanding open our
[1:28:14] understanding to the people especially
[1:28:15] in order to what we've tried to say
[1:28:19] because there's nobody trying to condemn
[1:28:21] nobody we're all in a big old mess
[1:28:25] called life
[1:28:28] but we know who can straighten
[1:28:30] everything out make all things right
[1:28:34] Lord we just ask you now to go with us
[1:28:36] as we go eat a natural meal
[1:28:38] sanctify the food to our bodies and us
[1:28:40] into your kingdom that we may be what
[1:28:42] you want us to be
[1:28:43] Just Have Your Way Lord guide us now in
[1:28:46] Jesus name
[1:28:49] you dismissed
[1:28:51] there is God
[1:28:55] day with no
[1:28:59] heartache shall come no more clouds in
[1:29:04] the sky
[1:29:17] go Shore
[1:29:19] what a day glorious day that will be
[1:29:32] when my dreams
[1:29:34] National
[1:29:37] Snyder look upon his face the one who
[1:29:42] said Me by his grace and he takes me by
[1:29:48] land
[1:29:49] and leave me through that Promised Land
