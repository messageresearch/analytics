[2:57] Jonah - been reading the scripture now
[3:03] for quite a while I hope it don't get
[3:06] dis interesting they said but I will
[3:10] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[3:14] Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have
[3:18] vowed salvation is a
[3:20] the Lord and the Lord spake unto the
[3:22] feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the
[3:25] dry land all right let's go to John 16
[3:30] and we'll go to about verse 26 and begin
[3:34] reading I wish you would read this back
[3:37] above and get the point you know of what
[3:41] he's bringing to but we'll just start at
[3:44] verse 26 he says at that day you shall
[3:48] ask in my name and I will say unto you
[3:52] that I will pray the Father for you for
[3:57] the father himself love with you because
[3:59] you have loved me and have believed that
[4:03] I came out from God
[4:04] I came forth from the father and him
[4:08] coming to the world again I leave the
[4:12] world and go to the father
[4:14] his disciples said unto Him lo now speak
[4:18] us now plainly and speakest no parables
[4:22] now are we sure that down knowest all
[4:24] things indeed it's not that any man
[4:27] should ask thee by this we believe and
[4:31] once by this we believe that thou camest
[4:36] forth from God jesus answered them do
[4:41] you now believe you may be seated the
[4:45] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[4:47] the word now what about all the way
[4:51] through in the place he had come to in
[4:54] this writing and all of what we're
[4:58] talking about in a position that they
[5:02] finally said we believe huh and he said
[5:09] well do you now believe see as we bring
[5:13] the thoughts that we've been at it of
[5:15] bringing salvation and talking about it
[5:19] in trying to end up the Old Testament
[5:22] and this message is kind of just like a
[5:25] wedge to go between the old and the New
[5:29] Testament in our understanding so we can
[5:33] follow the
[5:34] point to really get you know the meaning
[5:38] of her or what I'm trying to get across
[5:41] to you all right because see the Lord
[5:45] Jesus actually came you know between the
[5:50] old and the new testament all right see
[5:53] a lot of people say you say turn to the
[5:54] first book of the New Testament he'll
[5:56] turn to Matthew well that's not so it's
[5:58] the book of Acts all right let's see in
[6:01] his life and time up you know from his
[6:06] birth to Calvary is dealing with the Old
[6:11] Testament form in the basis that you
[6:13] know he's talking to those people back
[6:17] there about salvation now he hasn't come
[6:22] to pay the price yet but yet he has told
[6:27] them about these things and that's what
[6:29] we've been trying to you know accomplish
[6:33] in dealing with so much on Abraham and
[6:36] talking about the father of faith and
[6:39] and the things and trying to get to a
[6:41] basis to really see you know about
[6:44] salvation cuz remember now how we've
[6:47] emphasized salvation it's bad it was
[6:51] back there in the Old Testament alright
[6:54] we know it we we see those things we see
[6:57] that those people experienced great
[7:01] mighty things all right and it provided
[7:05] of salvation for them that gave them a
[7:10] thing to that they would be even be call
[7:12] the people of God you know the children
[7:14] of God and all like that and they would
[7:17] would come through in their experiences
[7:21] and it provided a place for them to go
[7:24] to when they passed away
[7:28] it made a position there for them are a
[7:31] place of abode to where the soul could
[7:34] go until Jesus Christ came and then he
[7:38] went there and picked them up all right
[7:41] now so then salvation no matter whether
[7:46] it be the old are the
[7:47] testament I've emphasized over and over
[7:51] and I want to keep emphasizing that that
[7:54] you can't have a saw one salvation back
[7:57] here and then a different salvation over
[8:00] here it has to be the same for him to be
[8:05] Hebrews 13:8 all right now the the this
[8:09] back in the Old Testament we went
[8:12] through it over and over and over to
[8:13] what it was types and shatters because
[8:17] it never reached a fold in to the basis
[8:21] of their salvation all right now listen
[8:25] to the point them getting up see their
[8:29] salvation involved the basis of as I
[8:33] said to where they could go it to a
[8:35] place if they died in things but it
[8:37] never brought to them or a true eternal
[8:42] life in to their soul it only brought
[8:47] them to a confession right it brought
[8:52] them to a great point but it never
[8:55] brought that to them so the Old
[8:58] Testament could not bring eternal life
[9:00] into being into the people because Jesus
[9:05] Christ would have to come and pay the
[9:07] price that could go back and cover them
[9:10] because the Bible said he died once for
[9:13] all all right
[9:16] so he died for the sins of the people of
[9:17] the Old Testament the blood of bulls and
[9:19] goats and things that they done it could
[9:23] not remit sin so what it done it just
[9:27] kept pushing in as we call it pushing it
[9:30] forward until Jesus Christ came and paid
[9:34] the price
[9:35] then the sins could be remitted alright
[9:37] now then on that basis we we talked
[9:41] about that the time and the life of
[9:45] Jesus Christ upon the earth was sitting
[9:48] between the Old Testament and the New
[9:52] Testament alright and it would be to the
[9:56] basis that you know it would bring into
[9:59] reality and then keep saying it were you
[10:01] remember it that it provided a place for
[10:05] that person they're sold or being what
[10:11] they were to go to a position that could
[10:15] hold them and keep them you know until
[10:20] the finishing up of what would take
[10:22] place alright but see it couldn't bring
[10:26] a total deliverance right and we're only
[10:30] looking forward to but look at the
[10:33] difference now now it's not a difference
[10:35] between the Old Testament the Old
[10:37] Testament salvation was holding them
[10:39] keeping them in the right place but New
[10:42] Testament now when we get to that we'll
[10:44] see that it's not just keeping us the
[10:47] New Testament brings eternal life into
[10:49] being now all right by the new birth
[10:53] into each one of us now all right now
[10:57] truly then salvation is of the Lord
[11:00] whether it be the Old Testament or
[11:02] whether it be the New Testament and that
[11:05] would make him Hebrews 13:8 making all
[11:08] of that speaking of what would come into
[11:12] being by the new birth all right now
[11:16] because it would would run into a
[11:19] position but now I want to just take the
[11:21] thought of what the disciples all right
[11:26] now because I want you to think now this
[11:29] is what I want you to think women's or
[11:30] not I want you to think back in your
[11:33] life you know as to where you began in
[11:38] your Christianity all right I just want
[11:43] you to kind of let your mind run in the
[11:46] line of thinking of your Christianity
[11:48] and how that it's come to where it is
[11:50] today okay
[11:52] the COPE that away the point I want you
[11:55] to do is to anchor it in one thing it
[12:00] was not salvation in the Old Testament
[12:02] just for everybody right I've never I
[12:08] didn't believe that in the Baptist and I
[12:10] certainly don't believe it now I don't
[12:12] believe that every time they took a lamb
[12:14] in a manager
[12:15] walk up with a lamb just nuns a lot boy
[12:18] it down and say offer that lamb for me
[12:21] I'm going back and live you know like a
[12:24] well-being I never believed that like I
[12:27] can't see that because I look at the
[12:30] sincerity because if you're gonna do it
[12:34] that way why didn't he save everybody in
[12:35] the Old Testament all right yeah but
[12:40] those who believed him
[12:42] and accepted him as to their thinking
[12:45] for the time is what I want you to think
[12:48] about I know this has been about three
[12:51] messages on believing but you're going
[12:56] to see it tied together the Lord willing
[12:57] I hope when we drop over into and get it
[13:02] into the new birth and the things all
[13:04] right because now why would Jesus he was
[13:09] expressing to the disciples some things
[13:12] and they said okay we now believe that
[13:22] you know you are left on this quota many
[13:27] other scriptures all right because as
[13:29] many of them that would say we know that
[13:31] thou art the Christ you remember that
[13:34] the disciples said that we know that
[13:37] that you come from God we know this we
[13:41] know that about you because we believe
[13:44] it and the Bible speaks heavily of
[13:48] believing you know that a lot of times
[13:51] the fire sees it would be listed of the
[13:53] fire sees or some of them and it would
[13:56] say that they believe but then why did
[14:02] they not go on to receiving their
[14:07] salvation so then we need to think a lot
[14:13] about the word believing and then the
[14:17] Bible speaks of believing and he that
[14:19] believeth which would bring it into Pais
[14:22] tense different things to do so the
[14:26] disciples said okay now we believe
[14:28] you're the Lord
[14:29] believe that's we you know as I said
[14:30] putting a lot of scriptures into one
[14:33] lump sum we see that the people would
[14:37] come to a position of believing and they
[14:42] would move up a little now when the
[14:47] disciples first heard of the Lord Jesus
[14:49] would they have dared to had said we
[14:53] believe you come from God the first time
[14:56] Nicodemus you remember he said we
[14:59] believe that you come from God but do
[15:02] you believe that he believed that when
[15:03] he first heard of the name Jesus no when
[15:10] probably Nicodemus first heard of Jesus
[15:12] he was probably upset and wanted to get
[15:14] rid of him no but yet after a while he
[15:21] begin to realize that there was this man
[15:26] was and he said we believe you come from
[15:28] God but did that save him no but yet it
[15:38] was greater than what he had believed
[15:40] when he originally started now are you
[15:45] thinking about your experience you
[15:47] remember when you first want to remember
[15:49] your young you know like were born and
[15:51] raised in church but do you remember
[15:54] your experiences in church and going to
[15:57] church and going to Sunday School and
[15:58] going to you remember your teachers you
[16:01] remember the things and you remember you
[16:04] had little plays and you had a little
[16:05] this or you have a little of that and
[16:07] you you went on and after a while you
[16:10] grow it into more believing so see
[16:14] that's our problem
[16:16] when you say believe basically everybody
[16:20] says I believe well why does it not
[16:27] produce salvation now the Bible says you
[16:31] know we'll get back in those things and
[16:33] what is in romans that if you believe in
[16:35] your heart and confess with your mouth
[16:37] that you're saved well you know there's
[16:41] millions on record
[16:42] of churches that have went up and made
[16:45] that statement and said we believe and
[16:50] we accept Jesus Christ as our Savior but
[16:52] then to go back into the world what's
[16:56] wrong
[16:58] did he not even have any believing no
[17:01] that's where we look at it in the wrong
[17:03] way we're going to try to define if we
[17:06] can - now if we don't we pick up Sunday
[17:08] that there's a vast difference between
[17:11] believe and believeth the vast
[17:20] difference between the two there's a
[17:23] difference between our mental faith our
[17:29] confessions and a spiritual revelation
[17:33] right now but here's where the problem
[17:37] is no matter what you have of what you
[17:41] want to call the level of this this this
[17:43] I'm here I believe this I believe that
[17:46] no matter what you have you begin that
[17:51] by believing you begin it by believe it
[17:59] somebody talked to you about God you
[18:04] heard a preacher you some something
[18:06] happen that triggered your thoughts
[18:09] about God and you started believing well
[18:15] you know what we're going to get to and
[18:17] I'm certainly gonna just drop a
[18:19] bombshell on you and then we'll go on
[18:21] and we won't talk on this now but you
[18:24] realize that your salvation begins when
[18:27] you believe I don't have a problem but
[18:36] hold that because I'm not gonna express
[18:38] it I didn't say you got saved over the
[18:45] way you're thinking it I'm just saying
[18:47] it begin you gotta have a beginning to
[18:50] everything right
[18:55] he said well you know do you know just
[18:59] hold on them don't run off and thank
[19:01] brother Dale's going haywire
[19:03] but now you tell me the anything you get
[19:08] from God you first got to believe so
[19:14] you're believing is a major thing and
[19:17] the way you believe is a major time
[19:21] we're all of the Apostles or we call
[19:27] them you know disciples did they all
[19:33] finish up and go to Calvin you know to
[19:35] the upper room the receiving of the
[19:37] baptism the Holy Ghost no now cuz we
[19:40] know there was at least 70 walked away
[19:42] from him one time right the point is
[19:50] look everything that you get has got to
[19:53] be based on believing and that's why
[19:57] I've emphasized so much about Abraham
[19:59] because that's been my he is my I don't
[20:06] know what you call it Idol you know
[20:10] looking to or whatever to see and I've
[20:13] always looked even back to the Baptist
[20:16] times and all I've always looked enjoy
[20:18] and enjoyed talking and reading about
[20:22] Abraham because you know what it was
[20:26] just a human being
[20:28] he wasn't no SuperDuper this or that or
[20:31] the other he was just a human being and
[20:36] God spoke to him and said get up and
[20:39] leave this country as I said during the
[20:42] other days ministering owner he never
[20:45] heard sermons telling him about a God
[20:47] that told somebody to get up move or go
[20:49] and do he probably never heard of he
[20:51] nook he probably never heard of know why
[20:53] you know him he was a healer and he
[20:57] probably never had no contact but yet
[21:01] when God spoke to him he got up and left
[21:04] what was that all of Abraham's believing
[21:08] no because each step of his journey if
[21:13] you'll read the life of Abraham you'll
[21:16] see his faith constantly increasing
[21:19] that's what he's always been with me
[21:23] we talk about it you know we'll say well
[21:25] they brahim he uh he believed God and
[21:27] said it was 25 years before the child
[21:30] came and we we said he staggered not at
[21:32] the word of God you know one was
[21:36] believing well that's true but you know
[21:39] what he had a lot of staggering he was a
[21:43] human man that had a lot of problems
[21:46] right but the thing of it was as each
[21:50] time when God would spoke to him the
[21:53] first time he got him left maybe had
[21:59] wavering in it well yet he would hear
[22:02] that voice again that would speak to him
[22:05] again did he'd move on again I'm having
[22:11] waiver back of him but you need to hear
[22:13] that voice again you know what I'm
[22:14] talking about
[22:15] Genesis how he goes from one to the
[22:17] other to the other of things in his life
[22:20] right we said well he never staggered he
[22:25] gave his waffle man all kind of thing
[22:29] you know we see we look at those things
[22:33] and we don't realize that he was just a
[22:38] human being he said brother Dale but
[22:42] you've always preached because I could
[22:45] remember you always preaching Abraham as
[22:48] the father of faith I'm preset in the
[22:50] Baptist Church because I believed it you
[22:53] know why because the Bible says it you
[22:58] know that's why I emphasize a lot of
[23:00] things you know bosom of Abraham Oh
[23:04] before Abraham probably 3,000 years and
[23:09] all of those people out of all of that
[23:12] and now you got a nut you got Adam you
[23:16] got Noah you got all of those but none
[23:19] of them ever turned out to be called the
[23:22] Father
[23:22] faith none of them that was ever put in
[23:30] a position of the man that we called
[23:34] Abraham the man that could believe God
[23:40] he kept on believing him and is he
[23:42] believing he was raised higher he's
[23:46] believing would raise higher now do you
[23:49] understand why did I start back here and
[23:52] get a promise of a child and run around
[23:57] him emphasizes that he staggered not but
[24:00] it just got stronger and stronger
[24:02] believing well wouldn't it be something
[24:08] that you could set down sometimes as I
[24:10] said there the other day why don't you
[24:12] do it sometimes think about your life
[24:14] and where you came from then once you've
[24:16] done it might encourage you because
[24:20] Abraham he's setting up Learning Center
[24:22] well I'll tell you what he it looks like
[24:27] it's pretty bad I'm getting older and
[24:28] older which said you don't want the same
[24:32] one that seems to be talking to me was
[24:34] the one that told me to just get up and
[24:36] come home and said you know what I'd
[24:38] done that and said after doing that did
[24:41] you know what he came to me and he
[24:43] brought me how her you brought me on her
[24:45] see the higher he got no wonder he
[24:47] staggered not no wonder the worse it got
[24:52] the greater he counted it to be true and
[24:56] looking for that son to come for sure he
[25:00] didn't understand sure he wanted this
[25:04] was what it said he had problems but yet
[25:08] when it would end in the end of the day
[25:10] he would come back to the place but then
[25:14] when the Lord promised me somebody make
[25:19] light of him when he come along you know
[25:21] in his name Abram means how father well
[25:25] you know kids but that was his name
[25:28] all right and he comes alone against in
[25:32] each one he's hi father
[25:35] but yet God changes his name to Abraham
[25:40] and it means father of Nations but yet
[25:46] only one son out of all of his children
[25:50] was chosen for the genealogies to follow
[25:55] down and go from one to the other one
[25:59] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and come
[26:02] right down to Jesus Christ great thing I
[26:07] was talking with brother long I really
[26:09] enjoyed him there the other night
[26:11] watching it enjoyed his services and
[26:14] humbly you know but I was talking to him
[26:16] about you know that Abraham wouldn't
[26:20] inju there was a Gentile there was no
[26:25] such word as Jew in the time of Abraham
[26:27] and coming over into the Kings through
[26:29] Judah in the different ones but Abraham
[26:34] was called a Hebrew no the Bible calls
[26:39] Abraham a Hebrew why you see what I'm
[26:47] talking about is increasing in his faith
[26:49] as he moves along why was Abraham called
[26:54] a Hebrew
[27:01] he was standing down there one day and
[27:05] he walked across the river and the man
[27:10] reached out and shook his hand said who
[27:11] are you eating it up maybe I am he said
[27:14] oh one from the other side of the river
[27:17] in other words he simply got a word
[27:22] Hebrew out of because oh you come from
[27:24] the other side of the river and that's
[27:28] what the word Hebrew mean one from the
[27:30] other side of the river but you know
[27:33] really the Bible said I brought your
[27:36] father Abraham from the other side of
[27:39] the flood he really did come across the
[27:43] Big River didn't he Hebrew doesn't mean
[27:45] a whole lot don't you come over the big
[27:47] river the flood he said well he wasn't
[27:51] back tyre no but when Abraham received
[27:55] that name or thought about and is he
[27:57] called him a Hebrew he was connected
[28:01] with the great eternal God his
[28:05] experience in growth that greater and
[28:09] greater in his life of serving God you
[28:13] agree until he would finally come and
[28:16] change him and come and do the great
[28:18] things that would happen in the life of
[28:21] Abraham all right can we see that we've
[28:25] come through those things can we follow
[28:28] our lives and watch the journey that's
[28:33] been in our lives as we've come down
[28:35] that we come from here we come to Nara
[28:37] we come to this you remember when you
[28:44] first accepted Jesus Christ you know a
[28:49] young child or something yeah but then
[28:53] it's been a constant growth in Christ
[28:59] ever since all right now if you can
[29:03] follow that then we're going to try to
[29:04] deal with the word believing they were
[29:09] having believed God he told him to get
[29:11] up move he believed him next time he
[29:13] spoke to him he believed him
[29:15] later next time he spoke he believed him
[29:17] greater why can't we accept that in our
[29:22] journey I thought I thought that we
[29:28] believe the Prophet taught a message
[29:30] where Peter had talked about faith
[29:32] furture and all this temperate place and
[29:34] I thought your prophet says we're born
[29:36] again and faith of course they've great
[29:40] revelations and the message others you
[29:42] can't be born again do you come up here
[29:44] with us
[29:44] Holy Spirit and all this you got it
[29:47] upside down and all great things but you
[29:50] know that didn't encourage my believing
[29:52] in you at all then didn't discourage me
[29:55] either
[29:56] because I knew the Prophet said you're
[29:59] born again at faith but you know what is
[30:02] each one of these you are being born
[30:06] again right your faith is increasing
[30:14] you're believing is increasing watch
[30:19] Abraham took this journey me when he
[30:22] read he done this and then brother
[30:23] Branham says let's see who over it
[30:25] who's this Mel Kennedy he said every
[30:29] seed of the faith will take the same
[30:33] journey that Abraham did well we don't
[30:41] have to go over the desert and walk
[30:42] around through the sea that's his carnal
[30:44] as we yet but ever born-again believer
[30:49] is to take a journey upward through as
[30:53] the word unfolds that's the stature of a
[30:58] perfect man and that's just greater
[31:02] believing they said this will be a
[31:07] background now so you need to listen to
[31:09] the point at least at least get the
[31:12] point that it's a constant increasing of
[31:16] your believing because in salvation is
[31:22] proved Abraham because what God done
[31:24] with him in salvation it is not a set
[31:28] down
[31:28] go so far oh I got it all when I believe
[31:37] no then Paul would say after all of the
[31:43] great warriors dire that was it where
[31:46] was it Ephesus well anyhow he comes up
[31:49] and he said have you received the Holy
[31:51] Ghost what since he believed oh but we
[31:58] thought we got it when we believed but
[32:00] he said since you believe we'll get into
[32:02] all of those things as we go along but
[32:04] do you understand what I'm talking about
[32:08] as you're believing increased or has it
[32:14] decreased now to ones who follow the
[32:19] message for a while and fall away you
[32:21] got to admit that there is decreasing
[32:22] you got to admit that I mean they were
[32:25] at one time believers right that's where
[32:31] we're going to get into the salvation no
[32:32] point you know the point that you can
[32:34] come to a place to you could be a
[32:36] believer and then you can lose your
[32:38] position and lose your confession and
[32:43] lose what little bits you have so that's
[32:50] a warning to us to not stop and our
[32:53] believing if you're believing stops if
[32:58] you're if you're believing does not keep
[33:00] constantly increasing and I mean
[33:02] revelation and believe in God and
[33:05] accepting it and being able to to walk
[33:08] in God and believe then there's
[33:11] something wrong with your believing to
[33:12] start with but what about it the
[33:19] disciples said Lord we believe you
[33:22] Nicodemus said we believe you're a man
[33:24] come from God then Jesus looks back in
[33:31] the disciples and he says you're
[33:33] believing all the way down you've been
[33:35] falling with me you've been walking with
[33:38] me and you're increasing in you're
[33:40] believing
[33:42] and says now that increasing in your
[33:44] believing has brought you to a place
[33:47] that you can confess that I am God
[33:58] but then he turns to it and he says do
[34:02] you now believe we've won evidently
[34:11] they're believing was not an anchors
[34:14] steadfast faith it was a mental concept
[34:21] now did brother Randall make that
[34:23] statement he said the biggest portion of
[34:27] our faith is mental faith oh we like to
[34:32] think it's great revelations but that's
[34:34] all for the message that's V Mia's
[34:36] name's the biggest portion of our faith
[34:39] is mental faith now listen to what he
[34:42] says it does there's a pretender he says
[34:49] there's a great faith in all the nature
[34:51] there's a nature given temperance and
[34:54] not like there's a faith
[34:55] and the biggest part of our faith is
[34:57] mental faith by hearing the word it
[35:03] brings us to a mental recognition of God
[35:10] by hearing the word brings us to a
[35:13] mental recognition of God do you
[35:20] remember when you first started in your
[35:22] life as a child or early Christian and
[35:26] compare that to where you are today in
[35:32] your faith you remember when you first
[35:39] started in your Christian journey that
[35:42] oh yes you had great faith but then
[35:46] things would fall apart around June
[35:48] you'd fall apart
[35:53] then you stop believing the way you did
[35:58] to start and see you've got trouble when
[36:02] you start letting things get in the way
[36:07] and not believing it in the correct way
[36:12] brother Branham said on the message it
[36:15] is I he said you can't be get warm by
[36:20] planting fire he said neither can you be
[36:27] saved by his a historical God now what's
[36:33] a historical God the God of history
[36:36] what's history by right well God just
[36:41] don't do like he used to do now where
[36:43] would that fit in the Bible how would
[36:45] that fit if God don't do like he used to
[36:47] do where would that fit with Hebrews 13
[36:49] night now they will not fit no way in an
[36:55] understanding if it's Hebrews 13:8 he's
[36:58] the same yesterday today and forever so
[37:04] what do we do then and that's why I hate
[37:12] to hear preachers preach sometimes you
[37:14] know in things and try to say well you
[37:17] know something like this an elder
[37:18] sitting around about way well God don't
[37:22] do today like he did when the Prophet
[37:26] was here now I declare that to be a
[37:33] Allah I defined that upon the basis and
[37:39] you say how would that be of Hebrews
[37:40] 13:8 well where's it at I've already
[37:47] preached those times I've always
[37:50] contended to one time the Prophet said
[37:54] they would be a ministry of jesus christ
[37:56] in the bride of Jesus Christ I mean the
[37:59] Bride of Christ they'd be a ministry
[38:01] just like he had I still believe that's
[38:05] around the world
[38:07] not in one person no more no but it's
[38:11] around the world then I stand with that
[38:14] as I've always stood with it that that's
[38:17] not confession now what's your
[38:20] confession
[38:22] remember whatever you confess is what
[38:24] you are you say he's the same yesterday
[38:31] today and forever only in a certain way
[38:35] now if you're not saying he's totally
[38:37] the same you know what brother Ron said
[38:39] he said a church it says that he says
[38:43] you good away from it now that was the
[38:45] way he said it so if you come into a
[38:47] door or hear of a church it says he's
[38:50] not the same as he's always been and
[38:52] I'll get away from that I don't have
[38:55] time to listen to those things oh but
[38:59] they don't say it that way brother Dale
[39:03] they don't they say he's not to sign him
[39:10] and he doesn't do like he used to do
[39:14] they trying to explain a little word
[39:19] called believe it and if the biggest
[39:26] portion of our faith is mental faith
[39:29] that's mental believing the Bible says
[39:35] faith cometh by what hearing it didn't
[39:40] say faith is hearing the no Bible or the
[39:45] Prophet is one saying faith is hearing
[39:47] your prophet or the Dakar the opposite
[39:50] that faith is not just hearing the word
[39:56] see mental faith is just our own ability
[40:03] to believe but you don't want God takes
[40:09] that I got some quotes Lyn on the desk
[40:13] waiting till later
[40:15] we're brother Branham will speak of
[40:19] people in their confessions and you'll
[40:26] say you don't want says that is your
[40:35] salvation because gonna start somewhere
[40:41] that's the purpose that I've been doing
[40:44] over all this time not just grab the New
[40:49] Testament and we say salvation so you
[40:53] know what most preachers would do they
[40:55] grab the New Testament they grab this
[40:56] and they grab that and they'd have you
[40:58] do it and running the aisles for
[41:00] listening to the things but if we can't
[41:04] go back in the Old Testament to see what
[41:06] their salvation was how are you gonna
[41:08] know what yours is if it's contrary
[41:13] something's wrong those people back
[41:19] there had a mental conception of the
[41:25] Word of God they could not have a Holy
[41:30] Ghost field experience of salvation you
[41:36] agree I mean no not to check errors
[41:38] they're gonna know whatever you just
[41:40] forget it because I don't depend on that
[41:43] that's your business if you don't
[41:46] believe it didn't forget it
[41:47] but listen you show me a word ain't
[41:51] right you show me were that believing
[41:55] that God brought eternal life to any of
[41:57] them no and because it he spent
[42:05] three-and-a-half years with her
[42:06] disciples they still never received the
[42:14] true faith until the day of Pentecost
[42:21] you know whatever one of those disciples
[42:23] we'll get back to it and talk about you
[42:26] know what they started their journey
[42:30] it wasn't no supernatural great thing it
[42:34] was just people receiving God's Word I
[42:37] always thought about that I thought well
[42:40] that you know that's really odd that the
[42:42] Lord Jesus he was just walking down
[42:44] through there one day and he he looks
[42:46] over and he said Peter throw down your
[42:51] net this throw your net down you living
[42:56] and everything tell your wife goodbye
[43:00] and said come follow me well see we
[43:07] could old Baptists you know what we done
[43:09] with him we had Peter born in him gone
[43:13] we had him accepting Jesus Christ right
[43:15] there and I was his salvation well now
[43:18] he died yet how can you help celebration
[43:21] okay but he did do it isn't it odd that
[43:28] Abraham left his family you know I mean
[43:30] who's supposed to left his had in there
[43:32] I mean is he supposed to live lot he
[43:38] left all of that ended hard when Jesus
[43:43] come he expected those disciples just
[43:46] lay down everything just not that they
[43:49] had heard this or seen that or some
[43:52] miracle he's just come on he never went
[43:57] down and done a miracle and then turns
[43:59] at Peter now done the miracle now you
[44:01] know I must be something so come on
[44:06] Peter had enough believing he said and
[44:13] you remember later on when they got to
[44:15] the place working we go
[44:16] we can't go nowheres else you are alone
[44:20] how the words of eternal life what can
[44:22] we do that's why they what no 10,000
[44:27] people accepted Jesus cried he picked
[44:30] out twelve and one of them was Judah
[44:33] you know we throw off him him a lot but
[44:35] the old boy fathered a long time you
[44:38] know what he had for the ministry he
[44:41] healed the sick and cast out Devils you
[44:43] know all that through Judas get part of
[44:49] the ministry he was a believer and his
[44:55] believe it was great but then one day he
[45:03] stopped believing he went as far as he
[45:07] could go
[45:09] it's hard to stay away from preaching
[45:13] when I'll be back on Sunday but you'll
[45:15] get a repeat so don't worried about it
[45:17] I'm just concerned with one thing try to
[45:21] get you to think as God accepted your
[45:30] believing
[45:37] then we talk about great faith and great
[45:41] things
[45:47] because you know you can't have faith
[45:48] without the Holy Ghost giving it to you
[45:50] now remember that we have studied these
[45:57] things before that the little woman at
[46:02] the whale the Prophet said had what he
[46:06] said she had faith for the time which
[46:11] meant what she believed it
[46:14] she got what she was asking for is all
[46:17] she needed at that time but it wasn't
[46:19] enough to birth her the Lord Jesus stood
[46:24] one day
[46:25] just prior to his death and said and
[46:29] breathed on a disciples and said receive
[46:32] you the Holy Ghost but we got over Abdus
[46:36] had him born again that time what did
[46:40] you have
[46:43] but then we heard the Prophet explain it
[46:45] didn't it he said is only a promise he
[46:51] said they didn't get the new birth that
[46:52] day it was only a promise thank God that
[46:59] we've been able to how the truth in that
[47:02] way we don't have to stumble along and
[47:04] want this is the one that sickens me but
[47:07] it tickles me anyway have you ever said
[47:09] in meetings especially the ministers and
[47:11] they'll say of what is your input
[47:20] you know what is your input now somebody
[47:24] define input it would probably be your
[47:26] thoughts or your ways or whatever you do
[47:28] and what is your thoughts what is your
[47:30] understanding now didn't know we had an
[47:33] input I thought we had a revelation of
[47:35] Jesus Christ I thought we didn't have
[47:38] any thoughts of her own I thought we had
[47:40] Jesus Christ to come and live in us to
[47:43] do his own thinking throughout but yet
[47:49] simply believing salvation of the Old
[47:53] Testament was based upon whether the
[47:58] people could believe that God had spoken
[48:06] to them right then we can see that they
[48:12] would move up higher into a substance as
[48:15] we said about the woman a substance for
[48:18] the time then we can preach Sampson as a
[48:23] part happening to him and his mental
[48:26] believing and all of the things that he
[48:29] had and all at once it begins to wall up
[48:32] into the man until it went beyond
[48:35] mentally believing it went into a
[48:39] substance believing it went into a fact
[48:44] that he knew God was with him we see
[48:50] David and we see him outturn why is he
[48:55] not afraid of the line the buyer and the
[48:57] job because it went from mental
[49:00] believing right Dipsy brothers joined
[49:06] him back went from a mental believing
[49:12] listen to a substance enough for that
[49:16] time no but you know what I love about
[49:21] it I live this about the Word of God you
[49:25] know that David killed Goliath
[49:30] what he didn't kill nobody else you know
[49:34] what I mean right in that battle he frog
[49:38] went over under tree said I only said
[49:39] okay boys y'all take care of them you
[49:41] know what they did then the children of
[49:46] Israel rose up under David and went out
[49:49] and slaughtered the kings and the thing
[49:52] because he sparked their faith from a
[49:56] mental believing oh yeah they had a
[49:58] mental even remember his brothers
[50:00] you remember David's brothers when David
[50:04] went out there to see him you know what
[50:05] to say it
[50:06] they said David have you come out here
[50:09] to see the battle and every one of them
[50:13] was singing who's going to fight who's
[50:16] go to fight but yet oh they had a great
[50:20] believing they were believers enough to
[50:22] line up for the army but they wouldn't
[50:27] believe in enough to go face that giant
[50:29] but David had a substance for the time
[50:33] that developed into his life until he
[50:36] was not ascared and what did he say he
[50:40] said to God that killed a bar the god
[50:45] that killed a line now let's let's put
[50:49] one more in there the God that walked
[50:52] out there one day and anointed me to be
[50:55] king and I ain't got there yet right
[51:00] come on Samuel anointed him to be King
[51:05] David knew they didn't matter what was
[51:07] going on with Goliath or anybody he knew
[51:11] he wasn't gonna die until he reached the
[51:13] throne he might have died and two
[51:16] minutes after it when he was going to
[51:18] sit on that throne because that prophet
[51:21] told him you see he had a faith for the
[51:26] time that your prophet will call it
[51:28] substance faith maybe not the word
[51:32] substance faith at that point putting
[51:34] the two words together cuz you won't
[51:35] find it
[51:36] substance faith you'll just finally pure
[51:38] faith or something you say well how do
[51:41] you know god I just got through running
[51:42] so since I come here
[51:44] today there's only about three of them
[51:46] you know but listen are you following me
[51:54] David started out believe in God he had
[52:02] been taught about God in the things
[52:05] right and he had a believe he would he
[52:10] didn't run out and kill Goliath until he
[52:12] killed the bar and the line right if
[52:19] they kept increasing until it become a
[52:22] faith for the time there would be a
[52:24] substance to make him be what he needed
[52:29] there's a lot of difference between
[52:31] mental faith and substance faith right
[52:38] Peter one day walked on water because
[52:42] Jesus told him to come on Jesus put the
[52:46] substance under and right then he come
[52:49] walking but when he realized what was
[52:51] going on he got the following and he
[52:55] lost the Prophet said his substance he
[52:59] said he still had his faith now you want
[53:01] that quote he still had his believing
[53:04] Lord saved me but his substance that
[53:10] went down underneath a lot of difference
[53:12] between mental concept and a substance
[53:17] I'm trying to get you to swatch things
[53:20] as it grows greater and greater those
[53:23] disciples those people back tire before
[53:25] Jesus Christ died to give his life to
[53:28] come and live into them did not have
[53:30] what would be known as a great substance
[53:32] faith they proved it when they couldn't
[53:36] cast that could heal if they could do
[53:37] that Carter told the one the little kid
[53:39] come along with epileptic child what did
[53:43] he say what did Jesus say he said over
[53:50] you of little faith
[53:54] he said in other words what you don't
[53:56] think about is if you could pray for one
[53:57] guy where I want to go they'd have a
[53:59] headache and he got healed and said why
[54:01] is this giving you trouble
[54:07] what are you driving at I'm driving at
[54:10] one thing heavily and hard because it
[54:14] ties the Old Testament with the new oh
[54:17] God wants I don't never quoting it there
[54:23] the other night but around said all God
[54:26] wants is one man didn't get in his hands
[54:31] he said he can't I don't turn the world
[54:33] upside down that one person and he did
[54:37] through the prophets ministry right you
[54:40] know but you know what that was an
[54:42] example that wasn't an only child
[54:46] oh that's what you think you think oh
[54:53] but that was an only child it's only
[54:54] gonna happen with him mm-hmm I made my
[54:58] statement while ago and I contend for it
[54:59] always how the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[55:02] around the world is exactly the Ministry
[55:04] of Jesus Christ and that was the
[55:06] ministry around the head was the
[55:07] Ministry of Jesus Christ you put it all
[55:12] back together and you got Jesus Christ
[55:14] standing on this earth right now because
[55:16] if you don't then you're not having he
[55:17] bruised 13:8 is to being true where are
[55:21] you listening the disciples said Lord we
[55:25] believe this but he said do you now
[55:27] believe in other words have you
[55:33] increased and your believing in your
[55:36] thinking to place it you can believe
[55:40] greater things
[55:46] you see if we don't start out with a
[55:48] mental fight we're not going to have a
[55:50] spiritual revelation now this is what
[55:52] I've always said I know they have always
[55:54] been throwing rocks at me about we don't
[55:56] need these deep things we just need to
[55:59] be simple well I thought the message was
[56:04] simple but I ain't gonna do it with a
[56:05] point of I'm making because you say well
[56:07] we need these deep well what's wrong
[56:10] with eating what was brought to us you
[56:15] know it might trigger something within
[56:18] us to eat the message it might bring us
[56:23] to a place that we can believe I said
[56:29] about David David's believing was
[56:31] anchored in the line the buyer the point
[56:35] that he was not King yet then he said
[56:42] who's afraid of Goliath but it's
[56:48] brothers they were great believers
[56:49] because they were standing out there
[56:51] with their swords more they was already
[56:52] and David comes up and they're all
[56:54] shaking and you know life in he's know
[56:57] what's going on they said have you come
[56:59] out to see the battle there was no
[57:03] battle to see and someone stepped out
[57:11] who had his mental faith had become a
[57:14] spiritual revelation you know that's all
[57:20] God wants us to do
[57:22] why is repetitive things of a wonderful
[57:26] outfit you know what I mean
[57:28] studying over and over in things he
[57:32] should bring us to a at least a mental
[57:35] concept now quote brother branham he
[57:40] said if I can't do these things what'd
[57:43] he say he said don't let me stand in the
[57:47] way of somebody that can well he was an
[57:52] example we'll use these leaders and come
[57:57] back to it like we did the other day
[57:59] know that Adam was an example example
[58:03] son that's what God wanted right what
[58:07] Adam was is what God wanted you know why
[58:10] he created him he made him that's what
[58:13] he made him he's making nothing else he
[58:14] made him that huh Jesus
[58:21] but Adam lost Jesus redeemed didn't it
[58:27] odd that here stands Jesus on earth
[58:29] I stood Adam back tire body spirit not
[58:36] eternal soul eternal when Jesus came
[58:42] what was standing on the earth a man
[58:49] that his body was not eternal but his
[58:53] soul and spirit was but he was called
[58:56] the what Jesus was called the second
[59:01] Adam is that Scripture the second out of
[59:05] what was it how is that scripture first
[59:07] hate men Adam was made a living soul is
[59:11] it when it no is it a second man Adam
[59:14] was made a living spirit or will
[59:16] quickening experience quickens for your
[59:17] honor he it moved into a greater realm
[59:21] of what God wanted but it started with
[59:25] him being and what was Jesus according
[59:29] to revelation 3:14 what was he which is
[59:31] the message to this age he was the
[59:34] beginning of the creation of God he was
[59:38] what God wants you and I to be now well
[59:42] but we can't do that see now the arsy
[59:44] unbelief now we're gonna hit this for a
[59:47] minute
[59:47] then we'll quit the anytime when
[59:52] something is presented to you and you
[59:54] back off and say but we can't do that
[59:58] that unbelief has stopped your believing
[1:00:03] oh no did put you back in the world
[1:00:09] no I didn't tell you only by it just
[1:00:12] stops you believing all right are you
[1:00:15] listening so you say well here's this
[1:00:20] and hear that but we can't do that
[1:00:25] you've automatically become an
[1:00:28] unbeliever now I know this is gonna be
[1:00:31] hard cuz it's three weeks I've been
[1:00:32] trying to study how to find the words to
[1:00:34] say it so get upset women do what you
[1:00:36] want to I'm gonna say it anyway
[1:00:40] you see our trouble is we're believers
[1:00:44] yeah yeah we're believers we've read
[1:00:50] this message we studied it we can tell
[1:00:53] you all the things run around and say it
[1:00:55] we can quote him about everything we can
[1:00:57] say everything but then all you got to
[1:01:01] do is say one thing and say well then
[1:01:07] Hebrews 13:8 declares him to be the same
[1:01:12] tonight that he was when the Prophet was
[1:01:17] here now are you following me then you
[1:01:24] tell me somewhere brother Dell we can't
[1:01:26] do these thing and I'm gonna tell you up
[1:01:28] front now so don't do it please now
[1:01:30] cause you can't get you feeling hurt
[1:01:31] coming you tell me that we're brother
[1:01:33] Dale we can't do these things I'm gonna
[1:01:35] tell you you're an unbeliever
[1:01:39] you won't tell you that he that
[1:01:41] believeth not is condemned already
[1:01:42] because you condemned your own self now
[1:01:46] God has never wounded and has never done
[1:01:49] and will never do again what was done in
[1:01:54] the prophets ministry by one man that's
[1:01:58] of it I have never looked for another
[1:02:02] prophet to come another person to come
[1:02:05] or anything like that but I've always
[1:02:08] taught what the Prophet said the
[1:02:09] Ministry of Jesus Christ would be in the
[1:02:12] world around the world in the Bride of
[1:02:15] Christ see that makes him Hebrews 13:8
[1:02:20] but we don't see these gifts of this out
[1:02:23] of the
[1:02:25] we're just not looking around but you
[1:02:31] know what somebody tell you that
[1:02:35] so-and-so happened do you believe it
[1:02:45] why couldn't we at least believe it's
[1:02:48] possible okay let's go with that
[1:02:52] why couldn't we at least believe it's
[1:02:53] possible but we you know somebody tell
[1:02:58] you what George don't happen there's a
[1:03:04] lot of people been prayed for you know
[1:03:08] you know they didn't get healed we don't
[1:03:21] know about them
[1:03:26] the only quote was right around them
[1:03:28] about it listen Church if we doubt in
[1:03:36] any way the fact that Jesus Christ is
[1:03:42] the same yesterday today and forever may
[1:03:45] I quote your prophet he said if your
[1:03:47] church don't believe that he's the same
[1:03:52] yesterday today and forever in every way
[1:03:56] now let's don't play around he said get
[1:04:02] away from it so you see why that I've
[1:04:10] got to believe if I'm going to be a
[1:04:15] pastor I've got to believe that there's
[1:04:18] no difference in the ministry Jesus
[1:04:20] Christ
[1:04:21] when he was walking the shores of
[1:04:22] Galilee then tonight I've got to believe
[1:04:28] that there's no difference in the
[1:04:30] ministry of brother Branham then there
[1:04:34] is of Jesus Christ tonight because if
[1:04:38] not then you'd have to get away from
[1:04:40] every Church yeah but that's just say
[1:04:43] SOB's they're like a brother told me he
[1:04:49] used to scream and holler at us he says
[1:04:53] if you got the Holy Ghost to end up show
[1:04:54] me a signs miracles and wonders I never
[1:04:59] got up because I didn't want no problem
[1:05:02] but I asked him to come to my house and
[1:05:04] we sat down and talked and I said you've
[1:05:07] kept on making that statement that if we
[1:05:12] got the ministry of Jesus Christ you
[1:05:15] know I mean we've got the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:19] I said here is the quote from the
[1:05:21] Prophet showing you all of these people
[1:05:23] that had to hold it go no well he said
[1:05:27] and you some of you remember the
[1:05:28] statement he said we don't have perfect
[1:05:32] love like they did beyond the curtain
[1:05:35] time
[1:05:37] I said well brother branham's saw a lot
[1:05:42] of people beyond the curtain time it had
[1:05:45] perfect love well that could be any this
[1:05:49] way that he see he was quick I said but
[1:05:53] and what the lady he met there was 90
[1:05:55] years old how about his wife that was
[1:06:02] there how about he's made the statement
[1:06:05] that his first girlfriend was there but
[1:06:14] you didn't produce enough of them one go
[1:06:18] you need if his wife was there she had
[1:06:22] perfect love all born to get believers
[1:06:27] how perfect love but are you getting
[1:06:30] what I'm saying if we don't believe
[1:06:34] tonight that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:06:38] yesterday today and forever we might as
[1:06:41] well go home and forget it
[1:06:51] the brother kept on quoting that until I
[1:06:53] told him one day I said brother I said
[1:06:56] now you're gonna get upset with me I
[1:06:59] said I'm gonna tell you you keep on
[1:07:03] saying if you got the Holy Ghost show me
[1:07:05] a signs miracles and wonders cuz I'm
[1:07:07] gonna tell you one time that was that
[1:07:12] same devil that was standing out there
[1:07:17] and Jesus hanging on the cross and said
[1:07:22] if you be God come down did you call him
[1:07:29] a devil no no I got more sense than that
[1:07:34] cuz he ain't the devil he wasn't a devil
[1:07:37] I said what said that through you is the
[1:07:42] same devil that said come down off the
[1:07:44] cross and I'll believe you
[1:07:47] what about believing how great is our
[1:07:51] believing do we believe well I believe
[1:08:01] everything the Prophet said hmm praise
[1:08:05] the Lord
[1:08:05] I believe everything he said well praise
[1:08:11] the Lord
[1:08:14] at least we got as I started to say well
[1:08:17] ago people always said I was so
[1:08:18] intellectual in preaching these things
[1:08:20] of the seals and if I only the one thing
[1:08:22] about it at least we've got to seed so I
[1:08:30] can't make it live anyway and never have
[1:08:34] tried so at least we got to see so what
[1:08:37] about these churches we don't believe do
[1:08:40] know that no we don't want to get
[1:08:42] confused we don't want to do that Daniel
[1:08:45] 70 weeks and them seals
[1:08:46] that's too deep that was for the Prophet
[1:08:49] okay if it was okay
[1:08:59] if it was for him only then you got a
[1:09:02] problem I can quote you from name-brand
[1:09:08] preachers one especially that said the
[1:09:11] third pool was only for brother Branham
[1:09:14] and the Lord Jesus Christ some of you
[1:09:19] probably heard that from him then he
[1:09:21] made a statement I don't have to argue
[1:09:24] with him that's what he said he said it
[1:09:32] was only for the Lord Jesus then brother
[1:09:35] Branham now may I read not with me but
[1:09:40] may I quote it and if you want even have
[1:09:42] it if you say that brother Branham was
[1:09:47] the only one and the Lord Jesus was the
[1:09:50] only one what about when brought around
[1:09:51] was said the third pool it's far the
[1:09:56] bride and the church is that the
[1:10:06] statement and to the totally lost now he
[1:10:13] said well brother Dale did that guy
[1:10:14] hinder your faith no he encouraged me
[1:10:21] because I believe the ministry Jesus
[1:10:25] Christ is here in the bride across
[1:10:28] around the world doing what he said he
[1:10:31] would do but you see the brother making
[1:10:39] his statement see he made this big step
[1:10:41] I believe it only for brother Branham
[1:10:44] and the Lord Jesus will brother Branham
[1:10:47] said it was it's it's it's hard it
[1:10:50] straightens him out for brother Branham
[1:10:52] to say that the third pool is for the
[1:10:55] bride that straightens out the doctrine
[1:10:58] of the man who taught that right but
[1:11:02] what about wrote around him saying the
[1:11:04] third pool was far the church
[1:11:09] I didn't make the statement and he said
[1:11:16] it was true that totally lost so you
[1:11:22] think I'm gonna quote that brother as to
[1:11:25] believing it like that no I don't
[1:11:27] believe it that way they something about
[1:11:30] my believing won't let me believe that
[1:11:32] you know why come I believe in is
[1:11:34] anchored in what the Prophet said about
[1:11:36] it what he told me it was far is what it
[1:11:40] is not what they say or this sailor
[1:11:42] that's it but you know everything now
[1:11:47] I'm going to bring it to a closed to
[1:11:49] narrow down the point and then we'll
[1:11:51] drop right back Sunday the Lord with it
[1:11:53] everything we get from God must start at
[1:12:00] a mental faith yeah but I got just super
[1:12:08] different revelation I got it started
[1:12:11] from a mental faith let me then at least
[1:12:18] mentally say the things the Bible has
[1:12:24] said the prophet has said let me at
[1:12:28] least say it mentally
[1:12:35] then I can at least say by believing can
[1:12:37] increase because I'm confessing that
[1:12:43] he's here I love that quote where the
[1:12:47] Prophet said I'm not saying he's coming
[1:12:50] he said I'm saying he's here well not
[1:12:54] when we're gonna say that we're gonna
[1:12:59] say he's here yeah but he ain't
[1:13:02] I didn't say he'd finished up everything
[1:13:04] I'd say nothing about it I didn't say it
[1:13:07] was all over well no I said he said it
[1:13:13] was here well then they say he's here
[1:13:18] because if I say he's here he come on
[1:13:20] the scene do something if I don't say
[1:13:22] he's here he can't do anything cuz he
[1:13:27] you're not gonna believe this statement
[1:13:28] but God can't work outside of your faith
[1:13:32] you sell murderers L know God can't work
[1:13:36] outside of somebody that will say it now
[1:13:44] God can do anything he wants to brother
[1:13:46] there he can but he won't he can save
[1:13:53] everybody in the world today right but
[1:13:56] he won't one because he can't override
[1:14:01] their free moral agency and he cannot
[1:14:04] get them to believe now I'm finishing by
[1:14:09] the statement of this will pick it back
[1:14:11] up
[1:14:12] he's everybody that says Jesus is the
[1:14:15] Christ are they saved they could have a
[1:14:22] point and a start because everybody's
[1:14:31] going to start time everybody's going
[1:14:34] out to start saying Jesus is the Christ
[1:14:41] and then not stop believing anything
[1:14:46] thereafter but everybody see your
[1:14:52] salvation I don't care who you are and
[1:14:54] how fancy anything is we believe the
[1:14:56] Prophet your salvation begins when you
[1:15:01] believe I didn't say in I didn't say it
[1:15:09] was all of it or nothing about it I said
[1:15:12] it begins when you believe now you show
[1:15:16] me in the Bible that's not right you
[1:15:18] show me and run rounds message they
[1:15:20] touch statements not right
[1:15:28] then at least we ought to be able to say
[1:15:33] it as a mental statement
[1:15:44] of salvation and then keep on saying it
[1:15:51] until it becomes a reality
[1:16:03] about it come on musicians how about it
[1:16:13] where are you at compared to where you
[1:16:15] was five years ago ten years ago 20
[1:16:19] years ago 30 years ago
[1:16:29] as your face stopped because remember
[1:16:36] we'll get to this if your confession
[1:16:38] stops your faith stops don't care what
[1:16:44] you call it
[1:16:45] it stops salvation is of the Lord
[1:16:55] everybody is based on one thing
[1:16:58] can you believe every person has ever
[1:17:02] been saved he's got to do one thing and
[1:17:05] that's believe you got a starting point
[1:17:11] that's how I believe at least we could
[1:17:15] say as their disciples in Lord help my
[1:17:18] unbelief in little word don't let me
[1:17:21] stop believing let me continue on so I
[1:17:25] told the Baptist's before back way
[1:17:27] before you know in that I never did
[1:17:30] agree with them did you got everything
[1:17:31] when you believed and I remember that a
[1:17:35] Baptist preacher that come in talking to
[1:17:38] me after I left I said what happened he
[1:17:42] said what do you mean I see you told us
[1:17:45] we was all saved when we believed I said
[1:17:50] don't play with me now and run back and
[1:17:53] say I didn't do I said tell the truth
[1:17:55] about it but he you told everybody when
[1:17:58] they believed that they're saved he said
[1:18:01] yes we did I said but what happened
[1:18:10] what happened somebody stopped believing
[1:18:15] somewhere
[1:18:23] would you say cause you believe you
[1:18:27] started in the right direction because
[1:18:30] you can't be saved without believing
[1:18:34] let's just don't cut herself I'm gonna
[1:18:36] written down with run around said people
[1:18:38] cut herself short he said very few never
[1:18:45] believe all the way to receiving the
[1:18:48] Holy Spirit of God but they start well
[1:18:58] we got less time why don't you just
[1:19:08] start
