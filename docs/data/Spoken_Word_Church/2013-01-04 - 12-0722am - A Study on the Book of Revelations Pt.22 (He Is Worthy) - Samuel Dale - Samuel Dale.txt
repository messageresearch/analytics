V brother might wonder what we mean Vine August here bunch of meetings going on up into the Carolinas there and uh so they we get a lot of people coming through from foreign countries and things we try to arrange for them to speak a little while okay let's read our scripture Revelations 1 1 through3 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and S he sent and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who our record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written our end for the time is at hand all right first Peter then 1 ver9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto them searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which within them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister these the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into wherefore gir up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought brought to to unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word and brother Joe gave me a thing so go ahead and pull up uh we want to read Revelations 5 cuz that's where we're at and brother Joe gave me a quote while ago that you know is a very good one you make a lot of statements you know and then you find out brother ROM said these things and you know you've heard them somewhere down the line before you know and uh the brother there your face is very very for meor see I'm talking about you brother The Visitor what's your name my name's uh brother Dan Roberts I'm from be Delaware all right okay glad to have you with us and you got to PR for me your face I don't know mean maybe we run in somewhere together again but we appreciate it but we you know we firmly believe that God sent a prophet in the end time so when we read these things you'll know that what we believe we don't believe that he was God but we believe God sent a prophet to us to speak to us the word of God Amen all right but now that saying let's read this from what the prophet I mean the Bible has to say now this is where we're at in Revelations 5 and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own now remember it's looking for a kinsman redeemer amen right that's right and I we much because no man see it's not not an animal not a goat or a c or as we read it the minute a lamb would come forth it would have to be a man because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lon of the tribe of Judah the root of David ha prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four be and in the midst of the elders to the lamb as that had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne amen now that's where we've been dealing with is trying to uh get an understanding to see these things and to follow their end now we have studied this and found out one thing for sure as I said it's not a a lamb the Bible says it's brother you know remember John he turned around and said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world when he was introducing Jesus Christ amen and so we know that's the lamb that we're looking for and all but we're trying to understand how it is to come up about in uh our day because the Bible has to be personal to you and I all right now we read in in uh and we've been over this and over in there in Revelations 1 that it's a revelation that God to give to Jesus to give to John you know to show into his Angel well that's not trinitarianism because that has no reflection whatsoever it's what would be used in the form of understanding in the Greek of imorph right e n m o r p h e IM morphe amen which means change changing your form that's right are something that can't be seen and then once it's I'll read that in just a minute but once it's open then you can see it amen and so then you know the the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's right revealing Christ to each one of us and looking back in the Old Testament you find the Christ you find who that was who it was back there that could tell Moses a better way of doing something when Moses was about to you know talking about the the the people and God was fixing to destroy them and he said if you destroy them destroy me right that was Christ in Moses so you look back in the Old Testament you look down through you find Christ Christ the anointing the anointed you know all right then when he came into flesh the it was the Lord Jesus Christ giv him the full benefit of the title of his name name and everything because father is not a name Holy Ghost is not a name son is not a name so who is it it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen all right the Jehovah the old you know Jehovah Jehovah of the old became Jesus Christ all right you didn't see any more Jehovah of the old now you can see references throughout the gospels about the father speaking and the things but remember you're looking at what we would call in our day the acts of a play that's right you know the scen of a play and that's what we've given the definition there from from the prophet of many times to you that chapter 5 is of Revelation is not a verse by verse do it it's a scene it's it's a it it's it's a uh preparing for the opening of the seals over in Revelation 61 getting the lamb in the right position getting everything set in and seeing it then we can see that truly it is a an understanding of one true and living God because we don't believe the the Trinity now we don't believe the Oneness right which is like your finger and Jesus they say would be the LI the imorph of God and we don't believe that because we believe the bride is the final imorphia in the Gentile dispensation and then when we leave out of here there'll be two witnesses come to Israel right and 144,000 taken out and they will be IM morphe of God or God using them God revealing himself through someone right see the body we we know for certain wasn't God right it was a creation according to Hebrews 10:5 a body thou H has prepared me all right but that Soul and Spirit that was within that body was almighty God or you you really messed up somewhere because Jesus said I and my father are one right all right then you know he said if you Se Me you've seen the father going through this the gospels so we're we're not Oneness and we're not Trinity that's right we're in the middle of those things trying to understand the the real truth of one true and living God Amen see Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human I'm a pastor I'm a a husband I'm a you know a granddaddy and a great granddaddy and all but it's just one of me yeah but I've got many ways of expressing myself right amen all right then to my kids I I'm not their husband right right MH that's a different form right right I'm a husband to my wife all right see then that way I'm keeping my forms correctly or in morphes or changing see and and that's what happened I married I became a husband but then through my wife and the and the lifetime and the doings of of life I became a father well see that's that's not another person no that's just another form of God as we'd say in trying to keep it straight of our understanding of the one true and living God God changed his form in many ways he appeared in many ways back there he appeared like the mzd the Bible calls him a man amen meled Paul did in his writings Y and and he said he was a man amen right but that man was God Amen cuz he had no beginning of days or ending of life right amen so then it had to be almighty God see then it would come down to to bring in the understanding of one God to where you and I can comprehend it and walk there in see then that's why we then uh I want to speak on it the Lord willing this coming Thursday I didn't get to go down this past Thursday to brother Collins say we had to call it off cu the boy and girl that was wanting he was wanting us to witness to some was not going to be able to be there so we're going this kind Thursday so you just pray for us that Lord would bless us and they want us to speak a little on the on the god head and to speak on water baptism amen then that's why we believe in water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen not father Son and Holy Ghost Father Son and Holy Ghost is not a name that's right it's the Lord Jesus Christ all right so we believe in in that and trying to bring it down to understand but see Revelations 5 then is a preparing for Revelation 6 to where it says and the lamb open the first seal all right so there a preparation getting ready right we went through chapter uh 4 of seeing that John saw a door opened in heaven all right then he heard a voice calling him up then he went up and then he saw a throne and then he saw one sitting on the throne right he was seeing the acts of a play you know close a curtain put up a throne close a curtain put one on the throne it was being done to give understanding to where we would know and it was getting ready to where we could understand the opening of the word all right now in doing that then see each one of those was an imorph amen the door opened in heaven who's the door Jesus said I'm the door all right he was the door to heaven the only way to get to heaven is through Jesus Christ so that was in in morphy right all right then he saw a throne right all right where's the Throne of God you say well it's setting up there well that's true but right here in our hearts by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right came the Father Strong into being right to fulfill what Jesus said in Revelations 3 about 22 know where he said he that overcomes will sit with me in my Throne as I have overcome and sit with my father in his throne right amen it's not two different Thrones it's a changing of an am morphe it's changing your form right when he was here on Earth he would speak of the son of man amen and see none of the writers understood those things you know they've done the best they could do right through the gospels but even in the the uh writing of the New Testament even the ones that wrote some more like John that had wrote the the uh writings there in John and spoke of the son of man but when he come to the Book of Revelations and wrote that he never mentioned the son of man other than one standing in the midst of the seven gold cany like un the son of man because that was withholding that was a form of God that man did not comprehend right they were looking for a messiah and they believe that the Messiah a lot of the Jews even today still believe the Messiah will be and they believe it will be a man sure amen you know that's right all right and believing it will be a man to bring the word unto him see then they couldn't see it though right dire because it was withholding from them am all right you see it's just a change a form so amen I hope everybody understands what I've been trying to do see the throne was a form of God that's in our heart one on the throne is the Lord Jesus Christ he's living now in our heart matching EX L what's in heaven cuz if what we're doing here doesn't match that we've got a problem you say well when I get up there to Heaven one of these days I'm going to see three Gods well you you're getting in the wrong place because there's not three Gods that's right there's one God manifested in many ways many forms many Amores changing his form to reveal himself to to the different generations and things that was to be done all right and see then we come on over into chapter 4 and we picked up the 24 Elders you know and we spoke about that the 24 Elders being what the 12 apostles and 12 Patriarchs amen and who was that that was Christ in the Patriarchs coming down you know and then it was Christ in the right 12 Apostles right coming down see bringing his word so that's another form of God that's another name morphe that was God showing himself in another way right all right then you come on down to we went through the rainbow the different things and we know what that is a covenant and and all and then we got up to chapter 5 and we started on that and it says that there was a throne you know chapter 5 that where we started reading there was one sitting on the throne and there was a book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne all right see now you're catching and picking up more and more of God changing his form all right we know the throne is in our hearts we know the one sitting on the throne is Christ in our hearts all right then the book we went through that that you and I are the book amen it was book the book the Lamb's Book of Life written before the foundation of the world Amen you know and that then would be the book that was in the hand of the one sitting on the throne right that's right and it would be the book that had to go back when mankind failed right there was no way for mankind to do anything once Adam and Eve sinned there was no way for God to bring that book forth and manifest it so he would have to do it down through time right you know all right then e he would come forth he would come into the uh Church ages then as we call it or start on the day of Pentecost and that would be the amorphia of God God living in his church living down through time showing himself for the different ages and and revealing himself in that form all right see then when the book is completed then that would be the end time or the finishing up of the ages right and you and I are that book right right that book is sealed up because you find it over in chapter 6 that there was seven seals on that book and they had to be broken by the lamb because that would be the only one and that's what we're we're want to get to today is to see that he's the only one worthy amen you know because there's no way for anybody else the proclamation went in heaven or brother around said it one time like this it was really great he said heaven was search and Earth was rsck right said you couldn't find nobody worthy right right all right now you could find some worthy but they hadn't changed their form right the lamb was there sitting on the throne right right amen that was the lamb sitting on the throne cuz he said I've overcome and sit with my father and his throne all right so that Throne being the baptism of the Holy Ghost then see down to the ages it could be made manifest and that Throne then is here today in our hearts and our lives you know living out because we're comparing this with what's dark that's right looking at seeing why because there's one thing for sure if you can't find it d how do you know what you got here right right amen but if you can see here comparing to dark right yes sir all right now you know you got to be getting close that's why I said then you come down here and you say well brother Dale I I believe in three Gods well then read me the Bible for it right right right I mean show me in the Bible where it says God and three persons Blessed Trinity yes Co equal and coeternal now want scripture M but I can show you where it says there's one sitting on the throne and say there was three Thrones right there's one sitting on the throne so you're Bel living one of your Gods if you you know got a trinity thought and that's just you know to help us all but think about it the lamb was in was there but not being seen right right because the lamb was on the throne yes well that's what happened because that's what the scripture says then he went to the right hand of the father right is that scripture see when he died he went to the right hand of the father and Steven when he looked up he saw him standing there we see that's like the brothers there the other day and we leaving Lord willing um the 30th to go to Florida and fish for a few days and the brother that was there you know and we've talked with him D he has a little bit and you just a few things and he was he he said well I'd always believe that that was Jesus standing up there the father said no here you know and I said yeah he said but you took that out of my mind tonight well you know what it took to get it out of his mind just a simple illustration that God see we think we try to explain all about how that he's just one person he's just he said when you said that God wouldn't send his son to die for our sins that's right he came himself y That's Right amen he said that sealed it from me he said I seen it CU you think about it would you send one of your kids to pay you know you got a debt to pay you got a somebody going to be killed today you said well okay go ahead now wa you you go I'm you know I'm going no no a good to father wouldn't do that that's right Amen Let see God didn't step in heaven and send a son no that's right amen he was living in that flesh called the son right amen he dwelt on Earth that's why he said if you seen me you've seen the father amen that's right cuz he was here upon Earth all right see then that's that's where it comes down to sometime a simple illustration will break forth a lot of things right so this one is worthy let's let's read what the prophet had to say here I don't know where Joe cut this did you capture this brother Joe the one you gave me anyhow I can read it to you this is taken from Revelation 5 part 2 19616 18 paragraph 131 and now when John wept we read there in the scripture that he wept because no man was worthy now someone as I said last week they said John wept because he could find nobody worthy it wasn't that watch him now so you'll find him saying that he couldn't find somebody worthy but listen to his explanation he wasn't that a man under the influence of the Holy Ghost wouldn't weep for that thought that it cuz he wasn't worthy the that's what people think John wouldn't thought he wasn't worthy right there's nobody worthy but he didn't weep because of that now listen but this quote with all the other quotes that goes with it I believe he was weeping for Joy because he had seen the whole Plan of Redemption was wrote in this book here right it wasn't because there wasn't nobody worthy because D stood a lamb right d was Worthy so he was weeping there he said Oh Glory to God listen to him directly when he goes to shouting he was weeping because he was happy right see now that doesn't change a point of thought that you would think about that he was thinking it was nobody worthy and that the lamb you know the lamb was there sitting on the throne right all right he climbed upon the throne and sat down he was there but he was not coming forth as the lamb right the one to be the Kinsman all right now we know what the kinsman redeemer is according to the Book of Ruth there was a requirement for a Kinsman to come forth amen Boaz he was going to do the right of kinsman but you know there was one closer kin to Ruth yeah right and see when that happened he had to wait until that man decided he didn't want to take that R all right then he could take the r and you know you and I were born kin folks to the devil whether we like it or not right we wasn't certainly born kin folks to God that's right amen now I hope you don't believe that amen this thing out here wasn't born kin folks to God this old nature that we had in ways was born kin folks to the devil but see then that man refused to pay the price or to take off his shoe and show the sign in the Book of Ruth and when it did Boaz was capable of taking it because he was the next one in line of kin it had to be somebody kin to you right amen all right so the Kinsman we found would had to be almighty God had to come down in flesh right that's right amen amen now you wouldn't be kin folks to God if Jesus wouldn't God himself right you say well no no no he's just he's my brother well that's right he's your brother but God was in that flesh that's right that's right God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself scripture that's right all right in him the Bible said dwelt what the fullness of the godhead bodily all right so then looking at it we see the IM morphe is the way to look at it he's changing his form so I hope you was listening the way I gave it see then when you see him in these in the chapter 4 and now in chapter 5 you see him as he's changing his form amen he's going from one form to the other all right now and when we got to that part of the Kinsman we found something that was very odd all right this lamb that we read of was a funny looking lamb remember the Book of Revelation written in symbols right all you got to do is find out what the symbols are that's right right we know who the lamb is the Bible declar is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Amen the proclamation went forth and the elders said as we read there the Elder said behold the line of the tribe of Judah amen has prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals well now who was the line of the tribe of Judah where did Jesus come from the tribe of Judah a lawgiver was to come from Judah as a promise in the scripture all right well then he was the line of the tribe of Judah right but when John introduced him upon Earth he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Amen right but lamb is Kinsman lamb is Redeemer right cuz that's what they gave in the Old Testament they never put a Lon on the altar no that's right for a sacrifice right right Lon is King yeah Lon is symbolic of King right all so when he's coming forth in the end time to take possession of you and I to walk off this Earth in a Rapture you know going away caught up whatever word you want to use word rapture is not in the Bible but it caught up is but see he will come forth he will become the line of the tribe of Judah amen because the millennial Reign that what Jesus was speaking of when he said he that overcometh will sit with me in my Throne the his throne is Promised the Throne of David in the Millennium right David's son was to Reign on his throne Solomon in the natural reigned on the throne of David you know but Jesus Christ will reign on the throne of David in the Millennium as the son of David because he came Son of God Son of Man son of David the Manifest himself you know to show us where we're at and what's going on all right see that will be his in morphe changing his form do Israel he'll be the son of David do you and I you know who he'll be he'll be our bridegroom yeah he'll be our husband that's right amen he he'll be our father all of our beings and whatever we have need of right and we'll be in a millennial Reign for a thousand years upon the Earth right you know to show that the sin curse is gone from Genesis all now but that blood of the lamb as first Peter called it 1 Peter 1:18 there calls it the blood of the Lamb amen all see I said John he said the Lamb of God he didn't say the lamb he said the Lamb of God right but then he would have to be in Redemption he'd have to remain a lamb right right see then when we come to where we're at now we come to the basis of seeing that he is now to be we got to see him as the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Amen in other words our Revelation has got to come to the position to wor that we can see Jesus Christ truly as almighty God right that's right not a second person or a third person that's what the Catholic Church taught us yeah and US Baptist and Methodist and things swallowed it down and thought it was true until we begin to read the Bible for oursel amen yeah see and that's when I was even in the Baptist I would argue with them I said wait a minute my Bible says there's one God something wrong here you're saying it's three now show me where that's in the Bible Well father son holy I said Jesus said I my father one right he said I come in my father's name well you know the father's name would have to be Jesus amen right the only name he ever had on Earth y you remember they made it Jehovah in the Old Testament that wouldn't correct it's jvh V or jvh uever which one you want to use they could not pronounce it right there was no way there was no vow heart added you know enough to it to be able to bring it down to a word to comprehend call it they call it g Das o d God is the way the Jews were WR it you know but they know that that means something you remember Moses at the burning bush who am I going to say he said go down there and tell them the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he said okie dokie I believe in the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob but they had a personal experience with you now who do I tell them is sending me right he said I am that I am that means ever present for eternity you know wasn't it odd that when Jesus come along he said before Abraham was I am that's right then on the Revelation you find I am the Alpha and Omega right same God Amen changing his form changing his under you know to where we could look at him right and the morphy to be able to understand it all right now what I want us to think about for just a minute is as we read there and I'm quoted it to you did John knew who who spoke to him yes when he saw that door open in heaven and he knew who that door was he wrote about it yes in his writings you know I am the door of the sheep folk right he heard the voice yes and he knew that voice because he' walked with him for three and 1 half years now get up the setting of what I'm talking about he knows about the Throne of God because by the time John comes to patas about 1895 R in there he done had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and somewhere in the 830s on the day of Pentecost right he knows God is real amen he's not looking for a god he's looking and seeing who that God is and he sees the throne and then when he comes to Revelations 5 he sees the one on the throne and the book in his hand he knows what those symbols mean cuz he was chosen to bring to be there you know yes like I said the Holy Ghost what 60 years or something he understands but yet he knows there must be something happened all right and no reference have we ever made or ever will make that there was a lamb back dire you know the die for our sins and there's got to be another lamb over here that would be contrary to the explanation I've been giving you but if we can see that that lamb back there was the form of God upon human flesh to be a Kinsman amen all right then we can see that same God come forth in the form of the Lamb no there a funny looking lamb right now John knew the lamb but what was odd to John was to look at the lamb when the Elder said the line of the tribe of Judah had prevailed when John looked you know we read chapter 5 a lamb came forth right as it had been slain now John knew that was the Lord Jesus Christ right that's right but what was the odd part was the symbolics it came forth or every how you say it the symbol y the lamb had seven horns y and seven eyes that's right now we just read that in the Bible chapter 5 amen that's an oddl looking lamb and like I told you when we started this series we we've been through it many times before that people told us stay out of the Book of Revelations you can't understand it why not why not since God sent a prophet to show us what the symbols were and some of those symbols didn't have to be broken by the prophet that's right John you read even Scofield will tell you about this lamb he tells you all this here that talking from Revelations 5 he said the two visions are identical speaking from Daniel I'm talking what what scoffield wrote he said the Revelation adding that which was hidden from Daniel that the Kings and the priests of the church age are to be associated with the son of man the lamb that had been slain so they knew some of those things they could write about it see all right so John knew who this was but the symbol was the thing that he needed to have an understanding why would it have seven horns and seven eyes right and the the the Proclamation was was a man worthy when was a lamb Worthy right a goat or a horse or a dog or a whatever see it was was they was a a man worthy well John looked to see this man that had been slain and he saw he had seven horns and seven eyes all right now we went through that couple of services through the candlesticks that Ezekiel speaks of right through the candlesticks in the Book of Revelation chapter 1 and them and John explaining that the candlesticks is the ages you know the messengers to the ages right and then you read them in Chapter 2 you know pergam t f you know right and you read the ages all right so there's where the horns come from in the eyes with a messenger to each age all right see then you can see back here behind it we firmly believe in you know the ages as they come down look a lot of people don't like to talk about Luther and Wesley and all of them people but you know I do amen because they had a truth for their day that's right when Luther walked out there with a J you live by faith now that was God's word you either believ that or you didn't get into the kingdom of God on that day amen no amen see then Wesley coming along preaching sanctification would work today wouldn't it get in the Methodist Church and try to preach sanctification amen my brother's a Methodist preacher so every year they get together and all of them go down to the beach and they got this big old house that they rent and they lay out there on the beach and their bikinis and they there everything things in the world and and they have church you know go by and see them walking into the church for short s you know and all kind of thing John Wesley turn over in his grave and you know that may be one of these earthquakes around every once in a while maybe he's rolling over and over because of what he knows they're doing right all right not make a joke but this is a point that's right right you know that John Smith the founder of the Baptist prayed for the sins of the people so much until his wife would have to lead him to the breakfast table I'm quoting history and feed him his breakfast right those people were sincere people to that day that's right yes sir we firmly believe in what they T amen the truth of what they T not the Trinity Doctrine Martin Luther taught a trinity baptized the father son Holy Ghost and said the Jews were to be killed he said because he was not the end time Prophet or the one set aside he was the one to bring the Jud to live by faith right and God used that amen so those seven horns and seven eyes we found to be the ages and The Messengers bringing their message mhm to see if there was anything worthy that's right but now here's the point I want you to look at I Tred to make it the other day that why would it come forth why would it we know that that that happened we know what happened at Calvary John and them knew what happened at Calvary they knew what happened to you know uh of the day of Pentecost and the coming of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right all right well why would it come over in the Book of Revelation to be calling for a lion or a lamb me to one what would be the purpose in the end time why would the Book of Revelation not simply have been written that Jesus Christ come and paid the price cuz you see on the day of Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost came into the heart of man that's the Throne of God right all right now that's your new birth but you see even though the price was paid for full Redemption by Jesus Christ he's not going to come back in the end time get up on a cross and die again no right but it's understanding what he has done understanding what has taken place amen all right it's like it is over in Leviticus over in Leviticus you'll find the 16th chapter of Leviticus they have a mourning for the kill they have a feast right and they have a Mourning you know a crying out a sincere time for the killing of the feast because that would mean the killing of Jesus Christ at Calvary that would be the tops and the Shadows that's that Christ that we were speaking of but see then you get over about the 23rd chapter of politicus and you find they having another feast and another morning a sadness a time you know for and it looks like it's for another killing right but it's not right it's not a reking see right it's bringing it back to understand amen you understand read it sometime when you get a chain I I used to preach a lot out of the Old Testament see Leviticus he he he he show Show Jesus Christ is going to die on the cross now Moses messed it up when he smoked the rock because he was to speak to the Rock right that's right but that didn't make Jesus Christ to have to die again in the end time it made him to where that he would be crucified by the effects of the people in the end time that's what Moses was doing when he smoked the rock instead of speaking to it right you so that it would come in the end time when it would set up organized religions and things and Jesus Christ would be crucified openly right what not crucified fleshly not back on a tree right but he would have to come back as a lamb to understand and to be able to reveal to John we have to come back and show us something it was not a re killing Leviticus wasn't a rilling right it was killed one time but it was a morning for the kill he didn't they realize what had happened that's right you think it ain't going to be a mour one day of a kill when those Jews threw two witnesses not through Jesus standing there in flesh because he doesn't come to this earth until the Millennium we meet him in the a according to the Bible amen that's right don't you think them Jews are going to be mourning when they separate apart amen and cry for days and they say where did you get the nail prints in your hands he said I got them in the house of my friends amen Amen in other words I was crucified for you you rejected the r of sunship Y the Gentiles accepted it right they became a gentile dispensation which would mean Jews or anybody can come in amen MH and said it was set up to where that could come into being yes Lord said now I've come to you he's not standing there when they prince in his hands right come on he's speaking through two witnesses Moses and Elijah and they're telling them the truth of the gospel righten and that 144,000 would be called out amen all right yes but see that's not a literal the Lord Jesus standing there right right but it's God in another form amen through two witnesses amen amen they are so close to God until God can speak right through them amen and bring down the plag Moses was so close to God until Moses they had to put a fail over Moses's face you remember that in the Bible the people couldn't even stand to look at him why he was so in in that presence of God he had become so much close to God until literally the prophet said one day like this he said when he stepped forth and brought his word he said he was God to the people right he said but when he step back he become Moses that's why Moses could get in trouble that Christ in Moses couldn't amen that's right right that one that was leading Moses couldn't do that why can't we see it then the amorph the changing of form he won't be there right through those two witnesses that's right he won't be standing there with them you know they're two standing here and he standing here no but they see what the Moses the preaches by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that they can can receive them and they receive it and they see that that's Christ and they say where'd you get the nail prints in other words who crucified you right you've been telling us now you've been preaching to us quite a while about somebody killing who killed him right he said I got in the house my friends right then they realized they were the one that killed him right you said no they W the one that's th000 years come on get the story they realized that their people the Jews was the one that killed Jesus Christ right was no Romans Spar the Jews put Jesus Christ on the cross they had their own soldiers had their own Army and thing on guards of the altar they were the one that took Jesus to the Cross right the Romans was just standing by witnessing the things it was my sins and your sins that put him on the cross but come on Church get what I'm trying to say yes he won't be there with the two witnesses right he'll be there so much in them speaking through them by prophetic utterance until the people will think we have killed Jesus Christ we have killed our God that's right now we realize that we've missed the ride of sunship the Gentile dispensation has taken it all right now so is it in this end time if you get what I'm trying to say you'll see what I've been driving at yes in this end time we gave Ezekiel see it's not a reking it's a mourning for the kill okay we gave the two witnesses all right trying to give you an example the two witnesses actually show Jesus Christ so much until they they see him but not physically with this lamb that you see this lamb in the Book of Revelations looking at it D you might up but he's not here right he's not here the coral bodies there right but when John begins to see what's taking place he sees a lamb yes that come from and I gave you the quotes from The Prophet right came from the church ages he died son of man there was no way to kill God right what happened to Calvary then simple they took a man that God was living within and nailed him on a tree yes and God came out of that if they took you and nailed you on a tree and you as a Christian you know what would happened God would come out of you that's right is that true amen you can't kill God Amen so he became son of man that's right God in human flesh amen and paid the price yes when that Holy Ghost came out of him on the day of Pentecost it didn't come back son of man it came back Son of God y the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come and live in our hearts right but in the end time it's promised to come back when the son of man is to be revealed Luke 17:30 right reveal word back in his bride again in the end time by the word amen amen are we tring together all the thoughts then amen I thought i' just take this today is a message from this the IM morphy the changing shows who's worthy amen he changed his form you know what form he's in now bride amen come on right bride form okay yep would he in Bride formed in Revelations one that's right that's right doesn't it say in Revelation 1113 he saw one standing in the midst of the seven golden counter sticks which is a church ages one La unto the son of man he didn't say he was son of man he said one La un the son of man the Bible's perfectly right right but he's G about there in Revelation 113 G about the PS mhm no that's not a male form right this G about the PS that's a feminist form right that's right that was the Bride of Jesus Christ in Revelation let me put it correctly where you won't misunderstand me that was almighty God in that is almighty God in his church right amen we gave you the quote from the prophet of that where he saw him in Bride form right saw him in Bride form in the Book of Revelations 1 all right then we went to Revelation 4 we talk about The Throne BL that's in your heart amen and Bride for then we saw one on the throne and that's the one on the throne in Your Heart Right Now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but a book was in the hand and that's you and I because we are the booken this Bible is just a record of my name while I'm here my name Samuel it's way back over here so don't get confused it's not my name written in here like writing Samuel it's what is going on while I'm here is my name in the book right right all right then doing it that way Samuel might have been right for Old Testament but you don't find Samuel written in the New Testament you it had to have change Samuel's okay for an Old Testament Prophet but the new birth in the New Testament brings you from Samuel of the Old Testament to the New Testament Christ right right amen puts Christ in you the hope of glory as the Bible say we see this book is a record of the people yes the book that went back in the hand of the one sitting on the throne wouldn't a Thompson Chain or a Scofield or a you know right King James version right that's right it's a book of names amen that's simple a book of names amen but then when it was put down here for us to read it was made in a book form right then we believe in the King James version being the correct one right Amen to give us the correct understanding but I read all the others I've got all kind of transl and I check them to read and see if they're right but this book see so you find Paul in this book but you know Paul you know who he was before then it didn't work as a new testament person he had a good name in the Old Testament didn't he his name was Saul you remember and his name was changed to Paul why because he was becoming a Christian amen Saul is okay he's Old Testament guy but he didn't work too good in the New Testament he needed a new birth amen so Saul got a new birth and he's named Paul se's got a new birth and he's called Peter that's right see that's where when you and I receive the new birth we have a new name amen that's right our name now is Christian amen written in this book amen this book is a record of you and I upon the Earth amen you want to read it like we talking about the other day the Bible says back over in here here said when the towers fall well we just remember two airplanes going up there taking down two towers check that and see if it's not talking to the end time amen then one time it says that they found a scroll and they stood before the water gate and read the scroll we've had a water gate in our day and the word came before The Water Gate the word began to be revealed before they had Watergate and The Nixons and all these other who that guy you know but listen church trying to make the Bible personal to you and I right to see ourselves written in the book because that's the only way that'll ever do the prophet said it like this one time he said when the bride realizes who she is and once she's here far she'll be gone you know what we're here for we're here to conquer death right that's right amen is what I said a moment ago on the day of Pentecost it was only the baptism of the Holy Ghost come in the heart of man the body was claimed sure Jesus Christ shed his blood on this Earth to claim our bodies right amen but they was not taken possession right but the new birth came in the heart of man and took possession of the heart soul of man not a heart thumping gizzard soul of man I mean your being of who you are yes all right but see these bodies has got to be redeemed are we going to lean back to the organized religion so we going to get me a new one when I show me that in the Bible I mean I just want one scripture show we in the Bible right then we're going to get a new body the Bible said we have a body like un his glorious body that's right then Jesus stood there after his resurrection with nail prints in his hand y That's Right put your hand in here Thomas Resurrection is not replacement right that's right what goes down comes back up right amen thank God for the truth amen that's right see we just what we was organized religion I'm not throwing off from nobody we all come from there right we're just talking plain see people didn't believe that God was capable of redeeming these bodies oh yeah we we've got a soul yeah we hope we got eternal life you never heard of that I hope I got it one of these days I know I got it but I hope I got it well you better get more than a hope that's right you need a hope which is the anchor of the Soul right to where that we can get him to the point of seeing who we are what's going on right we see an amorph A change so what's happening in the end time it's not a lamb coming back in a physical form right The Book of Revelations is not dealing with a lamb in physical form right come on the throne and the the book and the hand and the the the 24 Elders all that's not a physical form right right it's showing what's happened here right amen it's a it's a scene it's a an opening a showing what's happening here on Earth amen see then this lamb that comes forward to take a book it's not a physical lamb he's changed his form the lamb comes from the seven Church Ages which you and I have got to produce the lamb you remember I kept asking the question will your faith produce a lamb right so this lamb has got to come forth word not in heaven we a in heaven whether you like that or not this is not heaven that brother was saying last night that brother was preaching now we're already in the Millennium he said all I want to do is take him down to the zoo y you know if you say we're already in the Millennium according to the Bible in the Millennium the animals are going to be T right so let's go down to the zoo and you step in the lion's cage and let's see who's right right we're not foolish right amen we're not making jokes we're making truth that's right but try to make you you'll always remember that see if I get you to life you'll remember it but listen church this lamb is not to come forth and be slain it states there that he was slain the lamb that was slain 2,000 years ago there was a lamb slain for our sins this is not the coming forth of a Corporal body right that's what I've been driving and driving and driving and driving about it is to come forth in our bodies right yes amen not a Corporal body standing here he doesn't come here till the millennial reain right we ride back Revelation 19 coming through but he's here in Bride for amen the lamb that takes this book to loose the Seven Seals I know this ain't going to go over to prove good out there but that's all right but you just remember out there you just listen and don't make me say thing cuz this thing going around the world this internet system we're speaking around the world today they're listening all over the world China and India and everywhere else you just remember get what I've said before and don't make statements about what I'm trying to say Don't make me say something I ain't saying I've done said it over and over done gave the example this is not the coming forth of a lamb like a a a a a human mortal being right that's right this is the coming forth of Jesus Christ yes Amen in his bride amen amen cuz you got seven horns and seven eyes now come on folks who was it that took the book The Lamb not brother random we don't believe in that that deity right right the lamb come forth and took the book and Loos the seals right if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't know what's going on today you want scripture for it that's right no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be what the by the Holy Ghost amen yes sir and you stop any drunk riding up down the highway and you say can you say Jesus is the Christ Jesus is the Christ they don't mean they're saved that's where we Baptist was doing it I argued with them in when I was in the Baptist Church the Bible don't say he that believe it said he that believeth right right and his baptized shall be saved it don't say he that believe well all you got to do is believe but you Jud believed where's he at that's right that's right Judas had a Ministry cast out devil heal the sick and everything where's he at that's right that's right don't tell me he wasn't a Believer sure the Bible said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved amen right you stop believing you don't believe that's right right we get the point of what I'm saying this lamb that I've been talking about if you excuse me if you read what I asked you the breach in the seal book you'll know the things that I'm saying is right right this lamb came forth and took the book climbed upon the throne and sat down in other words became the one sitting on the throne right who sitting on your Throne today that's right who's sitting on your heart Throne today that's right well I think it's a holy ghost it may be the father I don't know who it really is but you better find out if Jesus said I and my father are one you better start thinking right well now brother what it is is like you was husband and wife you and your wife one not that kind no come on not that kind come on we illustrate not that kind you see my wife you see me might still be on the video part of it but everybody sitting here they can't see me so that ain't right right husband and wife are just an example or a Ty right that's right but Jesus said if you seen me youve seen the father right amen that's right so then he lied if he wouldn't him that's right that's right no problem with saying those words right why because when you line it back up with the Bible you can see it's right right get my point now trying to get through in a hurry this lamb that comes forth is not a mortal Corporal human being to take the book that mortal Corporal human being has done come and done his part right it's not that mortal Corporal human being coming again right he's in another form but when he changes his form is it not the same God Father Son and Holy Ghost manifestation right many manifestations of God I'm just not trying to preach to the brother back there right whether he's trinitarian or Oneness or what it is that's between him and the Lord right I'm talking to you church amen I'm trying to get you to see something go don't just sit there and say p it on back to the brother he ain't never heard this before he might have heard it a whole lot more than you have cuz he might have believed what he heard and some of you still ain't believing what what your ear when all of the years are preaching I've tried my best has to do it and you know it to preach it down to show it to you this lamb is not a Corporal coming forth of a human being right the Lamb of the Book of Revelations is not a it's a scene of an opening in a stage play yes it is not a natural lamb that's standing there in Revelation 6 and ripped off of right come on folks I told you back under we going to get in Revelations 5 this time and really try to get some understanding cuz I've been through this for years and years and years 40 years I've been preaching it to you but see this is not a natural lamb that walks out there cuz he got seven horns and seven eyes be funny looking lamb John says or the writer there says the lamb that was slain sure that was Calvary where he paid the price this is getting ready to Redemption right these bodies these things that we're living in that's right are to be totally made manifest in a Redemptive form right you want scripture for it Paul said changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye now if you going to get a new body what do you need to change in a moment a twinkling an eye you just throw this in away get another one it won't work you got too many scriptures standing in front of you see Paul knew the secret mystery that we shall not all sleep we shall be changed somebody's not going to have to die they're going to stand right here and be changed in a moment Weck an ey amen amen it's only because we can see this lamb and what he's doing and where he's at we're not up in heaven we're down here on Earth folks right right there's got to be a lamb to take a book for you and come on let's don't go wrong way with it there was a brother up in Tennessee up there that they people believe that he was the one that stood there for them no and brother Ram don't stand there no brother Ram is not the lamb no need a member of the body of Christ that's right this member of the body of Christ is exactly what the prophet of God called it yes an imorphia of God in Bride form and you know if you have eternal life I'm looking at quotes if you want them if you have eternal life God is not complete without you right that's right that's right amen amen come on you're not complete without you that's right we don't have time to read them but I got them laying here be glad to read them to you one standing in the midst of seven gold of can of was like a bride he was talking about Jesus Christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that Jesus was he poured into the church that's right you never took that one how many times you heard that quoted all God was you pour into Christ all Christ are in the church amen how many times have you heard that but have you ever thought about what it's saying all God was that's not doing away with no form nowhere that's right it's stating the fact of what we need while we're here on Earth is poured into Christ amen he was the fullness of the godhead bodily that's right all right if you pour all of that Christ into the church who is she right amen wait a minute you getting too far no I'm not getting far enough right right he was the fullness of the godhead bodily is that right and all that Jesus was he poured into of the church now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church the Believers right are we there yes Lord then it was God in them days it was God in man his son Jesus Christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man ordinary human it was God in Christ God in man the fullness of the godhead bodily in man God in man now it's God in men the fullness of the godhead bodily in his entire church manifest in himself fulfilling his word what's it going to take for us to come out and be the right one no leing among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhe bodily among you couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it Pentecostal age but in day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs yes sir God is not complete without you amen if you have the new birth right last one this generation must reveal Jesus Christ glad to give you these service if you want they've been quoted to you enough that you ought to start believing it amen right right and if I didn't believe it I'd just hang up my coat and hat and go somewhere there that's right amen right you mean brother Dale I know it but I'm truthful if I didn't believe what is being preached I'd go somewhere there amen that's right and find be somebody that I could agree with or go sit down on my pity Point pity party porch and be my own self that's right right cuz you know that have been around here I've been preaching this for 40 years and the first sermon I preached in 1969 was the Bride of Jesus Christ with the son of man made manifest on Earth CU we got to become the word amen we're not leaving out of here right this lamb taking a book is your own experience in your heart amen it is not a physical happening of the Lord Jesus Christ coming to do it it's your own experience those two witnesses will take your experience and go to Israel and break those Seasons That's Right amen they'll take your experience of Jesus Christ and tell them Jews how they missed sh amen but the Gentiles has received it right amen and look where we're standing standing complete in him amen come on Brothers standing complete in him amen and God joining himself to his church making her the fullness of the godhead bodily amen because he's not here in a physical form he's here in you and I that's right right he's not here at a Corporal being this taken of the Lamb I hope you catch that part it's not a physical being it's not a Corporal being that takes the book it's a revelation of Jesus Christ being revealed to his bride right and her becoming what he's revealing to her right that she can see who she is and then we're going to walk off you amen you Lord what that's correct there where is anywhere else to go we're not going to Israel they not Gentiles going to Israel they going to be two prophets they're Jews right amen they'll go to Israel oh there's a bunch of garbage in the message of who this and who that and what's trying to be something you know Gentile Prophet the Gentile bride and I never have agreed with it n because it' be two Jews they won't receive a gentile n that's right that's right they'll receive a Jew that's right when we was over there in Israel I rejoiced because knowing that Moses and Elijah would come to Israel after we leave and that Jewish god that did not believe in Jesus Christ but yet know more about Jesus Christ than most of you and me know he knowed everywhere Jesus Christ was ever been where he preached and what he done he said I believe told Brother George Smith I believe this man y'all called Elijah was the one that preceded the coming Messiah cuz you see those Jews believe Elijah will come before the Messiah comes sure absolutely they got a place sitting at their table they opened the door remember way preaching they open the door and all of their eatings when they get together they open the door and they leave a place and they believe that one day Elijah will walk in you know those Jews believe Elijah I'm quoting this Jewish man now he'll know where to put the temple right sure cuz there's an argument over where to put it they can't get it exactly right they you can't get it he said it'll be Elijah will'll have to come and show him to where with the temple yes that's right we're not looking at the wrong Elijah right we're looking at the what the fourth coming of Elijah is in our day right the fifth coming of Elijah to the Jews remember Elijah a double portion was up on Elisha of Elijah's Spirit John the Baptist com into power in the spirit of Elias or Elijah in the end time according to Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 that there was to be an Elijah come to us and then there's to be two witnesses go to Israel right and there is you five times right of Grace see these things we're looking for them to be literal that's what I'm trying to say today we're looking for a literal lamb looking for this that and the other get off of that cuz it's it's not there that's righty it's our revelation of who that lamb really is that's putting him back on the throne right amen that's bringing him to the right position go ahead what do we got 63 andbody got an need we'll s a song Let Go 263 263 once I was lost in sin
