========================================

the book of a wonderful book it is a book we all folks okay you know you're right I need to do that you're correct I'll do that when I neon yes it's permanent mom well yeah dry erase only certain people in this room right with some booths and oh thank you it comes off it does come off but with some effort we have to write on this board right here behind you what's on my knees like I need sounds new class less in the phone they'll go grab look on the dry right which are marking Rachel's old we're trying to go per minute so anyway we math we hate we make it that's just neon we may get neons and you good idea use neon cuz we can see this better huh only problem of this is we're gonna talk about dot I don't want to forget that pink okay so why do you want to be black either so you know evil black we're good to have it right here today sometime telecom sometime you don't that's good hey mauka everybody make sure you say hi to brother Russ dunker from Manus say master I am I in NDS Oba we're ain't sold down here him in a sort of a good heaven bless come all the way he grow a long way to gets dirty let me read you what Schofield said about this just to give you the theme of what's going on because like I said before in the book of Romans I believe if you get the history behind why it was written you can understand why Paul wrote what he did we know many scholars refute the book of Hebrews being written by Paul but man that's nothing but Paul can write that there's no other prophet at the time they could write the book of Hebrews like the Apostle Paul right so this is we said the writer the authorship of Hebrews has been in controversy over the earliest time the book is anonymous but the reference in 2nd Peter 3:15 seems conclusive that Paul was the writer so 2nd Peter 3:15 so may get second Peter 3:15 you got a Bible and let's read that I'm not going to get it because I opened up to this second Peter 3:15 seems conclusive then Paul was a writer see also Hebrews 1323 all agree that whether by Paul or another the point view is Paul in Ian or Pauline which they call the New Testament the Pauline he and Bible because Paul wrote eighty percent of it and his influence was all throughout all of because even though he did rock the book of Acts Luke root wrote the book of Acts it was written by Luke about Paul and the disciples though we undoubtedly have here the method of Paul synagogue address so my got Sega p3 15 brother remember reading it for second Peters they can be a prefect thing an account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation see they're hilarious no book of Scripture more fully authenticates itself as inspired the dates from internal evidence it is clear that Hebrews was written before the destruction of the temple in AD 70 obviously because follow dive in 66 this was written in 1864 so this is heading toward the end of Paul's time on earth all right the theme is the doctrinal passages revealed the purpose of the book it is written with a two-fold intent one to confirm Jewish Christians by showing that Judaism had come to an end through the fulfillment of Christ of the whole purpose of the law and to the heart hortatory passages there what that means they tow RTA T or wipe acid you show that the rider had in view I wasn't gonna read this he's obvious over text edited but I felt led to read it because Scofield you know an endo that Scofield is a Trinitarian there's a lot of things he does bring out history that is exactly the tree alright brother brown use go field a lot rather omits not the person to come up with the word theophany and all those things Scofield wrote about it in the spin in the 1600 you know or sorry in the 19th or early 1900 so let the but now brother Brian picks up by inspiration that it's the truth and then he then he showed us to that you you don't follow everything that Scofield said because he is a trinitarian and he'll tell you the trinity is laced throughout the bottom I hope we'll get on you business my trade may be in other people's minds it is it is clear from the book of Acts that even the strongest of the believers in Palestine were held to a strange mingling of Judaism and Christianity in other words like 21 18 through 24 when they mingled they're together and that snare would be especially after entangled professed Christians amongst the Jews of the dispersion get in here synaptic a plenty room for you any the key words is better Hebrews is a series of contrasts between the good things of Judaism and the better things of Christ Christ is better than angels than Moses than Joshua then Aaron and the new covenant then the Mosaic Covenant Church truth does not appear the ground of gathering only being stated which is 1313 will read that the whole sphere of Christian profession is before the rider in other words he's exhorting Christians but just what about was all about Hanson exhortation necessary to warn an alarm a mere professor in other words common people read it and get alarmed by Christians read it and say man that's the way business was done babe my sister just died all right Hebrews is in six divisions but these include five parenthetic passages of expectation number one degrade salvation number two the rest of God rest are as the rest of God which is in Chapter three and four our great High Priest which is in five to eight which is man it's going to be wonderful when we get into Melchizedek the New Covenant and the heavenly sanctuary which is chapter eight through ten number five the superiority of the faith way which is verse 11 and number six the worship and walk of the believer priest which is after 12 through the end of the book so he kind of breaks it down just keep that in your mind because what we're going to do today is it wants to see something that's going to help you maybe for my brother Dale's been preaching on the Son of God and Son of Man and son of David because right here Paul starts out God who had Sundra times know that Sundra is what many in other in other words Scofield the original says in many parts and in many ways so God who in many parts and in many ways spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets who was that Old Testament whilst going back into the Old Testaments and the prophets talked about God and he was what he was Jehovah in the Old Testament right hey he was also if I could get that a little bit deeper boy you could see that Kinnear there's your son of God now back here we're going to put creation there male camel that because in the beginning you're gonna look through out here that verse two we're going to see who he's talking about God who at sundry times name not told my Jesus told my God God who a son used to hold this thing for keep that ID month for a little one wait outside for a little one we know that but I've just got to read you the Bible and we got to figure out because Trinitarians read this and see it their way but we're gonna look at it and see there is a there is a position because remember this Creator God was not Jesus flesh right flesh Jesus damn I say what Jesus there's not flesh Jesus okay it's not flesh Jesus that flesh came from God but he had to be put in the womb it had to be mine your brother cuz right here this is not my brother wait a minute this is what father this is father when he when he comes out and says let there be he becomes the spoken word I am now I spoken word we know was going to continue on to be made flesh called son man Jesus Christ right if I got that okay now remember we're not trying to darienne's we're not Tunis there was one man standing at creation and said let there be now it was the same man that should have stood on the shores of Galilee in the year 80 28 went on whatever and there I say man but just different positions different offices alright so we looking at the son of God which is the spoken word know what goes look God who has many times and in many ways because remember every prophet didn't exactly describe God the way the other one did exactly you see him in your own revelation that's what we were talking last night we're going to rush you know the people we have been told for years in the denominational world the grandma is gone to see and he's she said she's walking with Jesus on the streets ago that's not true we know that but why did they say that there's not a doctrine in the Bible they've been told that they've been told that hell is eternal because it's not in the Bible they've been told that a father son Holy Ghost is is a trinity of people and but that's not true but they've been told that somebody do they believe it believe a lot and be damned by alright so we know that this man walks out this theophany man walks out says let there be light but then he what he is Jehovah father God through the Old Testament there is no way he can enter into the soul of an individual even the great Moses and all because remember we're going to look cuz Christ is better than angels then Moses then Joshua then Aaron okay now we know it was Christ in Moses but Moses can't even be a son of God he's not there's no son of God in the Old Testament except Adam when God took a piece of this and put it in out and made him a son of God it's right am i okay with that we got it all right but we'll continue just to make us watch garlic summertime the divers manners spake in times past unto the father's by the prophets in other words what was carried down from the Old Testament has come down now to where Paul is standing if it seemed in 1864 and 80 60 s we've been 30 years since Jesus came on earth he's already left he's already come back into people and he's already into Paul and Paul I'm coming into him by the new birth all right so this is so this is not Paul's writing this is Paul's this is Paul's character but it's God God's writing this Paul is not taking his own thought and writing this with he's writing this by what somebody inside of him is telling him to write right we're my times pass under the father's by the prophets now remember you take Ezekiel and son brother development cover that prophesy Son of Man with what was that that was God in human flesh temporary temporary but you and I are not temporary God would come down on Moses and so so in dwell Moses to let have to hide his face he would speak in and God wouldn't it would just happen wait till Moses want a crime speak why that was Moses crying and one God crying but God would anoint in the Old Testament he would come down just like now you got to take your holy of holies I told you this Hebrews might last us in the Millennium we may not get off of this so thank you we may not get off of this for for a long time but you know the book of Hebrews to me it just covers everything so we look and see that went the temple when they built the temple in the Old Testament I've been back in the lead or even Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy stron to get the law and all the feast days and stuff together but what happened was now they were a pillar of fire right cloud by day pillar fire by night but every once in a while during the first one part of the year that would settle down into the Holy of Holies one man would walk in and offer a sacrifice for the whole of Israel and the Shekinah glory would cover the temple they didn't cover it all the time it was above us dawn above us okay right because he didn't want to dwell in a box he wanted well into people but he couldn't because of what happens in the Garden of Eden that blocked every bit of that for man to get back sorry forgot to get back into the soul of man until he came to eradicate sin in the soul of man he had to stay above them drop down every once in a while and anoint Moses but then Moses obviously was still Moses when he struck the rock instead of speaking to it all right that was Moses and then you take the Elijah and Elijah and all the different ones you look at their life and you look at their prophetic their just their God to the people but a lot of people didn't pay attention to what they say Isaiah was killed as a young boy because of what he said all the different ones were killed and sawdust under Isaiah was and all the different ones we read that in the mob but I think is still in Hebrews 2 Hebrews 11 40 well 120 40 you cannot do away whatever we need to talk about going can we skip to Hebrews 11 40 no we gotta we gotta get all these other people perfect at first but the blood of bulls and goats that's what people even in the message don't understand the blood of bulls and goats only covered you see that covering that's a cover yes so that when sin was here on earth he come up to here and it wasn't eradicated he bumped up against it and it stayed right here right up underneath if I okay with that okay right like he couldn't if he went to God he's not to kill home right so it's but he didn't do away with it because it was still there brother Brandon will tell us one man go in make a sacrifice for committing adultery go right back out committed over the next year Brando sacrificed the next year why because the cover-up therefore cannot be made perfect by the sacrifices but seem when that son of God drops down into time see that's what makes a difference okay these were natural lambs that died just as they substitute for what was coming okay cuz watch let's continue on going to at Sunday time many times in many ways baking times past unto the father's by the prophets so in other words God would anoint Moses they would come off of the guard would anoint he lasts you listen that wasn't anointing of God of Elijah when he got the two she bears to kill the forty two kids that was the Elijah but remember God had an honor when he said he was so close because why didn't God say no will I show my daughter kill no the honor what that prophet said my brother branham brother Monson I can make this give work I can make it work why because he's still closely done in the prophetic way he's so close to God he can make it work oh my God thank you alright so in other words he would anoint the Prophet now remember when Jesus came we're gonna talk about a little bit later when Jesus came sure there was anointing that came oniy for his ministry but he was born Lord the Christ he has that Christ that was in the Old Testament above he had it in him he would didn't even have it in him he was in its name alright so but we got to stay up here though happened these last days spoken unto us by his son not this son he come as the Sun man okay which is God in human flesh now these were gone in human flesh but they weren't good coke totally residing in that flesh that's right he would anoint Moses to do what he needs to do then he would come off of that man come Moses and Moses could be a murderer each one in the Old Testament listen they all have flaws every one of them they was someone or something that they did on their own that even got honored because they were so close to the office but now the son of man never come down here and then one day you saw him out drinking a beer and then the next day you saw him promise on her being gone no he would got all the time not that he wasn't inhuman nothing he didn't have to eat and even have bad thoughts you got to remember his best friend let's just say this was his best friend was man Magdalene at one time and she was a prostitute so he had to see that world going around him young talents in other words what I'm saying is Jesus didn't get up and all of a sudden all the sin that's laid down you know just lay it out off of him you know and I didn't know the Bible says demons came to him after the 40-day in the wilderness the demons bothered him during that whole time and God sent angels the straight thing why because he was in a human body he was subject to be your brother this is not your brother that's right this is daughter liya mm-hmm it's not your brother this is your brother okay you're going to buy right with that like I said sandy you can be a son man by the new birth but you can't ever be the son of man because you were born from a Monday through a sexual act and that's not the one I want okay but now that part that come into you this part here when it comes into you that makes you a child of God you retain your Paul says follow me in the one regaining or regeneration all right in other words so we're being a rejean from the inside we still have the same genetics we were born with but we're being rejean I was telling us last night and I'm working on a little project to bring out a point of what the world sees normal we see abnormal what we see right what we see normal they see uneven vice versa book my thing we're so abnormal you still London and you don't need to make yourself brother perhaps and don't make yourself on he said you're already on okay the things that the world is just you look out and they just you know they hang on politics and they hang on sports figures in Hollywood and and so on so American zone you get those little people magazines and you walk by the wall Martin they put the magazines right here where when you stop you gotta read them all woman born with four you know and alien born for a woman and you're sitting there going they play right here and we read them now we may not pick the book up and bottom but now see that's what they call normal just to pick it up and buy it would be abnormal if you saw that in what is once the name of one of them is it global no anyway so you know you've looked up inquiring minds want to know that's not that's the name of a planet and we want to inquire about this this what we're acquiring about today happened these last days days 2000 years so Paul is at the beginning of the church ages but he knows that this is gonna last all the way to the consummation hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he had whom he hath the partner whom he who need God and appointed the Sun not the bit too different people say here's were trying to say oh man the Sun is the Sun is getting something from the father position that's right position position Jesus Christ is God Almighty in human flesh but at one time he wasn't in human flesh now I don't like some I'm not going to ever preach on it or hey this may be all I can say online but there was enough substance of God in the Garden of Eden we said well he was a spirit he was a theophany he killed two lambs pulled their skins off and throw them into bushes for Adam and Eve so he must have some substance more than just you know floating like go in you know no gods person and he had something you can call it flash for what are you going through but that the often he was really real it was like there's nothing like that that's in these last days spoken unto us by son let me have to point in heir of all things know you so you go back to Roman's when we were in Romans 2 Jesus Christ we are heirs and join it we can't be drawing heirs with this guy he's never sinned a day in his life this is never a man that's been tempted this man was tempted same man different form this man's been tempted you can't tempt this man that's why that's why he kept Jesus kept pointing back to who mother the father is greater than me well why because the father's the creator he never he never lived the day on this earth that he had to worry about a prosecute walking by and with no clothes on but when that man decided because of me and you see he decided all this because of men you had to come down here to get us he had to be this and he come down through this barrier see from right look from right here up is eternal from right here down had to be made eternal now the son of man didn't have to be made eternal but that flesh he was living in he had to be made eternal that's my brother Brown said he said what did Jesus inherited he inherited eternal life now he didn't have to enter paired eternal life cause he was this guy this is eternal life but he inherited eternal life in his body and then he didn't just keep it he made a way for me and you to do alright so after these last days spoken to us by son whom he has appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world so who is making the world the Creator that's why Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God Christ we're gonna do this again - we got to the crime stuff here so this man become who Jesus Christ there was many Jesuses in that day there was many Judas's there were common names there even common names now but there was never a Jesus Christ okay do I got that that's not leave baptize not in the name of the Lord it's me we baptize in the name of the Lord - giving his ownership rulership Jesus Christ that's the complete baptism because really to be technical nobody in the Bible was ever that was written was baptizing them with Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says in Jesus name that's where the Jesus name people get it and Jesus Christ it never says Lord Jesus Christ but when we had a property come along to tell us that he's our Lord so we give him that we give him that position - not we'll give it to him but I'll words he's in that position because of us to be the Lord you gotta have somebody to lord over all right so here's here's Jehovah God in the Old Testament can't come down through the the red the blood or our the blood of bulls and goats is right here right mm-hmm I didn't write that but this is the blood but it is a substitute God's own will put this blanket here so I don't kill anybody cuz it's not even just come right now with angry eyes and just kill everybody on the face of the earth and he would start all over again but he said I'm going to in to me genesis 3:15 greatest great script in the world i'll put enmity what is enmity division I'll put division between me and the people but I'm gonna come down and I'm going to do what bruise the head of the servant so when you do you come down through that and became the Son of Man which is now man blood and the Laughing Man blood is different from the life and animal blood animal blood it has a life in it but there's no soul no controlling factor read your Bible read the prophets message the word if you really understand the word if I got this because the Bible says that that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart dividing asunder the joint número dividing asunder of the soul in the spirit the joint Ameri so if you know the word there's a body of spirit of soul in a man there's only a body and a spirit in animals so that's one of the killing an animal it's not murder that's murder s brother Brian said you just like gonna kill animals here consider you but now you're not a murderer according to the law Colicchio animals all the time sacrifices I mean that was a whole deal God looked at them sacrifices and said I'm gonna withhold all this sin until I get down here and I'm gonna make one sacrifice that's what we're gonna read in Hebrews he said he sacrificed one time for all if the blood of bulls and goats would have worked there would have been no there would have been no need for the preacher or pastor to get up every Sunday and preach he could have just preached one service and be done with it that's basically what he said but now we have to go whoever the way let's go back but he made one sacrifice for so the son of man is the one that made the sacrifice he was the sacrifice behold the lamb of God that's not the lamb of God this is the Lamb of God okay that's why are you gonna see and I hope rather Dale covers it later on but you know we're talking about the other day this is the way I see even revelations filed he took the book this man no this is one it was sitting on the throne this man took the book behold the lamb of God take what's in the world then you go look and said John what you see I turned from the line of the troubleshooter when you turn EC saw a bloody lamb this guy doesn't bleed never happens that what I'm saying it's not two different guys I'm saying guys so you can understand it in plain language this guy don't bleed this guy bled so who was standing in front of the throne he was sitting on the throne that's the Father's throne today the son of man came around the throne and you see the bloody lamb he takes the book the Sig steelbook of redemption and there she said my seal right there the son of man this is not this is not the Seventh Seal if the Seventh Seal was for our Redemption this is all Redemption this God doesn't need redeem his body needed redeeming right Jesus's body needed to be redeemed all right and as being redeemed now you and I can be redeemed so that she seventh seal the six seals is what sealed up in the buck and we're sitting here today opening the book trying to get the people to see but who took it the son of man took them up so you there's got to be in the end time there's got to be a revelation of the son of man take the book okay we alright with that but man blood what died Forest had in these last days spoken this by son whom he had appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world we made everything by this man which was what John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us right but can you get it this way in the beginning was rush and the theophany form can we lift it can you swallow one time and read that John one let's go to John 1 cuz gotta be personal right man it's hot in here that's alright I'm sweating in the beginning now remember we we put our earthly name in there because that's the only way that I can identify Russ when I say Russ you know exactly who I'm talking about let's go right here so in the beginning was rushed and rushed with with God and rush was God the same was in the beginning with God if he's born again today not the man I'm looking at but that the Anthony man that's inside of this brother are you sisters nor anybody that was in this right here that said let there because where'd you come from I've always preached on Genesis 1:26 remember gentlemen 26 in the creation but it's not in creation where there's a there's a beginning and an ending thing is they bringing forth are stepping forward out of something so in the beginning you were there in the beginning we've done any work on cuz if you were h-hello how many times I told you weeks are still tunas tunas is Antichrist we think that well when God created he was standing there creating and all of us were standing around him not at that moment we weren't we were in that man and you know what if you're if you're God there's no part of you that's evil there's no part of you that someone else there's no part of you that is anything else I'm telling you that the only way we're gonna understand this Bible is because the guy that wrote is inside of you and you have to literally see my brother said when brother when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee where were you you were in that mass so I can understand what happened with Jesus when he did the things he did if you got the same guy inside of you so and then let's read verse 14 and the rest was made flesh see we put that all of Jesus but if you're born again today your word from the word inside of you is made made flesh because you were born by what the word you weren't burned by mom and daddy on that birth you were born by the Word of God which is who died right here this is the speaker this way the one that did the speaking to watch Paul look who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person so in other words this guy's the same guys this guy how do you express something you talk about when you express something you talk about it thirty Jesus talking about the father cuz that's all they can understand they couldn't understand that that was the father talking to them Peter I mean no sorry Philip if you've seen me you've seen the father but then the Bible says no man st. garden anytime Jesus was expressing that's what you and I have to come to a place to where we we can't be a second person well we're trying to express oh I know they're trying to devil's trying to express card yeah it's like a rush state you made a good point the other night last 994 lasted that Satan kind of fivefold ministry just like Jesus if he's a copycat he's got his fivefold ministry possible profits pastors teachers and evangelist yeah just like Christ has his apostles prophets pastor teachings of angels that was a good point because that's the truth cuz remember they're trying to be masters of the light they're trying to be ministers of righteousness but they're all they're not all devils but they've let the devil enter in and do things that we say is not normal they stay stays normal here we go with the normal map normal again so as I say we we must see that when God in morphe from here to here he just stepped over and revealed his total self in another way not me standing here and another guy's gonna be here and the Holy Ghost is gonna be here okay all right collect your Trinity the Trinity is they see all these separations and they can't put them all together because they don't understand theophany they don't understand this is this theophany here is the same here same here same here the same theophany of God that was staying said let there be because that's what they told him they said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God thou art the creator in other words what was inside of that man they knew they watched him create they watched him take five loaves and two fishes and make two more fishes and hundred more fishes and higher more lows but now remember here's the catch remember Jesus didn't just create from nothing when he was here on earth tell me there's not one thing he took what was already here and created right okay but now you see brother Brown come down a manifest his son died he created squirrel for nothing that's what God wants us to be delayed a long time we may need something you know what well you're creating all the time you're great atmosphere you create all these different things we'll get a little bit later I just want to kind of give you that that little point but remember we take this man and we go while he's over here all these over here we're over here if you don't read yourself in the Bible says the Word was made flesh the word in you was made flesh in you the day you got born again we were talking about something last night Enzo everybody's looking for the last scene well I'm not I'm not live from last see God knows who that seat is maybe in China and Africa rabbit but my job is is to when we get the baby here company mature come the last seat may already be in but he can't be a baby and take a body change he's got to be a grown individual in the word take a body change then when he comes to a place if he's gonna take a body change we gotta wait on that guy to get there but you gotta have somebody teach you how to get up there you don't just keep feeding milk all right so I'm not looking for the last thing you gotta find him and when he does this is our responsibility to feed him enough to get him on his feet to where he's not wobbling like a baby you know he's walking on his own two feet having these last days pulling us by son I told you we're worse to him about done here by whom also he made the world with three three and then we'll stop right here to be the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself no one else there was not three people on the cross one person purged him by himself look by his self upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged or what was that meant the Dunaway he didn't just hide them the blood of bulls and goats hid your sin it wasn't no more when this man came when sin came up here that turns into Christ's blood my brother Brian tells us in the token message that there's a red ring of blood all the way around the world even today but it's not animal blood where the sin goes up and just keeps bumping now the world does because they're still under the law that's right but if you're in Christ when your Sam goes in here and goes through that blood it turns white red the red is white so that's what that's what God sees he sees his he sees the blood that He shed so what you're gonna do he's gonna by himself cleansed our sin I'm sorry sins that's an S on their sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now he's sitting on the right hand of the Father remember who was the last one that moved the first one that died Stephen Stephen looks up and sees Christ standing up he's not standing here in the father's stead on the throne he's come to a position to a power and authority jesus said when he raised he said all power in heaven there's been given unto me why who was he given from the father in other words there was no when he came out of that grave there was no flesh man that was on the earth and God man that was inside of it he became a guard flesh man when he came another grave all power in heaven earth he didn't have to eat this man he wasn't ever tempted again and see before - you say what power stranges that everybody in that six dimension to the is passed on from this life thing that does not tempt they don't have a black doll they're not thinking things what they gotta do but it's done it's been cleansed by what Christ did and then he is holding them in a place of purity and perfection verse 4 being made so much better than the Angels and he has by inheritance Wendy and Eric eternal life in his body obtained a more excellent name than all the angels so let's go keep reading Hebrew reading Hebrew series to just that for our treatment so don't read the Hebrew seer didn't say a lot about one more damn can I give you right do you think that's there
