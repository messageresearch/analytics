that brother Charles Lee Johnson he was up in Irving Tennessee real longtime friend of ours that he passed away this past Friday and all and we just ask you to pray for the family and all he was a wonderful brother so this John one alright father we thank you for this day and your grace thank you for everything we come to an hour and time Lord we just set aside and to come under the shoulders of a roof and sit down and listen and let you speak to our hearts and our lives first of all forgive our sins and make us worthy to be able to even set in your presence and just bless and guide each one of us and nor didn't have your way remember the sick among us you promise to remember those that are not here the different ones going to youth camps and things and out visiting and going and traveling and just give all of a mercy to get back home everything be alright we love you and we thank you and we commit it to you in Jesus name Amen we'll read from John one that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God now see we say Word was with God sounded like two people that would not look at the next part and the Word was God so you bring it right back to the singular part see the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men the light shyness in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not now we'd be taking part of our thought from melikhaya 3 and 6 he says for I am the Lord I change not therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed in and you may be seated everybody in the family if they will will come on up and bring the little feller we'll have a dedication 'el service you know all of the family and everybody come home you know line up a round up here and get as close in as you can anyway or whatever and just come on up everybody we want everybody to be we doing things we don't believe in infant baptism that's if you do that's your business but we don't believe in that but we believe in what the Bible said they brought their children to Jesus and he blessed them well that's what we do we we just come together but we have a dedication and the whole family is to dedicate see now we're going to dedicate the baby to the Lord but just remember you are coming as a witness and standing here and you're to be a witness to this one you're supposed to dedicate your life then to the basis of seeing the child gets a good opportunity that way you help it and everything you can do and that way mainly what do you do you try to live before the child to where the child will see Jesus Christ and want to you know be a part of that because it's dedicating ourselves of the whole church so everybody will stand if you will the whole church then we dedicate everybody here is dedicated to see that this child gets a change it's an opportunity to how salvation and to everything we believe in in praying and asking God to take care of a lot of things so then that way we just commit it to him and we commit the child to the Lord but then you know what we'd have to do see we can hold the baby up and commit it to the Lord but then we give it back to you to raise now you uncle's answering everything grandmas and grandpas and and everything it's up to you to live before this child a way that the child can see Jesus Christ that's the greatest thing that could ever be thought of is to see that you would live and give your life to where you live because that's what a Christian is right a Christian is living for others and that's what we do okay now they can tell you he is official name and there's no way in the world would I try to pronounce all of it because I am NOT that talented so we go by little David we go by that and just say we're going to dedicate little David to the Lord okay hey buddy buddy yeah you doing on I just wanted okay so let's just all bow our heads and let's pray together and we just commit this little feller to the Lord and ask the Lord to bless little David and keep him healthy and to make him to be what he would want him to be and then we would live together with him to see that he arrives it down okay father we think you're an opportunity of taking a little baby like this and our hands and arms are not worthy but yet you gave it to a set of way and you gave a little baby to the to the family and it's a miracle Lord because we know the background story of even little Sabra that Lord there was no children to be there yet you blessed and you took care of it and you gave them Sarah then you now you gave them David and we just ask you Lord to touch little David we place him under the blood of Jesus Christ the word that you would be covered by that blood in the could be for you Lord we love you and we thank you we give him back to you now as we give him back to the family for them to raise him for your honor and glory we thank you for in Jesus name okay you want to wait the energy are you wide awake okay yeah I got a little bit not well okay you can be seated we appreciate everybody coming to say to the families Anderson's family sister Anna's family all the members of the families and for friends that come to dedicated a little feller to the Lord that if he can you know in the natural and babies are noise breaking down because of the immune systems is falling away but babies are really basically immune to sicknesses of things when their first five or six months you know and because that was the way God made it but then we get them to the Lord as quick as we can and dedicate them to the Lord to place them under the blood of Jesus Christ where he can come on the scene with them and take care of them and give them a good happy life and all and we just appreciate that appreciate all the families traveling they come from overseas and California is in New Jersey's and all over to see the little feller dedicated and we appreciate that we as the Church of Louisville we appreciate you being that concern to her you know that you would put forth an effort to show brother Anderson and sister Anna how much that you appreciate them and we do say to we most of you know the story little it was not to have any children it was hard and all but God took care of it we got a picture back on office it says a baby that faith brought well we believe that we believe that God made that he's all the supplies you know and now he's give him a little David and so then that sure that's doing now as brother brother said one time now and now look it's not for you brother Anderson or sister Anna to populate the whole world you you know okay and it doesn't matter to me how many out cuz I'm really one of those bleezin perfectly in predestination I am the 13th child of my family the baby in the thirteenth one and my dad when I was born was 63 years old my mother was 42 so I'm a firm believer and predestination now I believe the Lord took care of it and brought it there and that's why I love big families I don't know where most of you know those movies you made that they called it Dallas or something wherever I lived in a big old mansion thing you know and has well that's the way I'd be if I could I just have everybody to live around go away and we're doing pretty good we're within three or four yards of each other so you know we love it and and thank God for okay any other announcements always forget okay now what we've been doing for quite a while is talking about I've been trying to bring it from the Word of God and the both families know that how we believe that the God sent a prophet for the last days and and we believe that message that he brought unto us and we know that that the man himself was not God we don't put up nothing like that it's not true that we just honor the fact of him God sending us a servant that would bring us the Word of God because that's the main thing is serving God through hearing of the word truly we know that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so then we're reading here and we read that in John 1 where it says in the beginning was the word Word was with God all right like I said that moment ago see we say with God seems like two of them you know but then it would say and the Word was God bringing it back to the singular point though we believe in one true and living God because that's the difference in the way we believe in say the denominational organizational systems of you know the religious room we believe in a firm statement of stating one true and living God not God in three persons that's what you've been taught most of your life that it was God in three persons we'll just remember a person's a personality a personality is an individual an end vidual as a person so then you wind up with three God's not knowing it see it was taught to us and we believe that but the Bible says you shall know the truth and didn't say you'd know about it now I said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free well see even in the commandments the first commandment is what the Lord thy God is one the whole word no word does it declare there is no such thing in the Bible as a Trinity now if you can show me the word in there I'll be glad to to denounce my belief if you can show me some form of a Trinity I can't believe that I believe in and try own I believe in in one true and living God as a triune being yes because to make it simple Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human but how many are the of me there's only one all right see then that's the way he was you said well brother nobody has ever seen God but you don't quote the rest of the scripture jesus said if you've seen me he said you've seen the father he said cause I and my father are one well God was glowing in that human vessel that was created for the purpose of being our Savior and our Redeemer and to bring us to the position of understanding God in his ways and do it but yet most of our life we've been taught by mankind or whatever is to talk about God just being like a spirit you know we'll quote that scripture God is a spirit well that's fine but remember he's not just a spirit like floating around think that's what we were taught all of our life you know that that makes it something to work that nobody has seen God well I said there's a quote in the scripture moment ago jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father all right watch the problem see the one true and living God then comes down to the basis of seeing that God came to reveal himself to mankind right and being Almighty God the best words the theologians and things can get for it to start because you can only start from human terminologies and words if they use a word they call it Elohim and that word Elohim means self existing one right now you say well what now wait a minute there's a Trinity alright now how can the father and the son be the same age that's not even cents son can't be his older his father that's plain sins so then we don't believe something that away we believe in the one true and living God and there was a time that he was self existing which meant in plain language he dwelt alone what else could you say we're trying to explain an eternal God you say yeah but we can't understand why can't we understand it why did he give us the Bible if we can't understand why did he open the word unto us if we can't understand who he is and what he's doing see I'm a firm believer in God being real you know you say well he's just a spirit and he just with me at work no spirit you're making it too much like a pie Rangers or some of the terminologies you using the of these great things with their supernatural power you know this that or the other and so you put it all in the looks on don't put it dark God is real and that's the question I've asked you over and over how real is your God how what do you think about it what do you think about how that he could create everything and you mean that this is greater or more real this would this flesh is more real than the God that created it that's not even human sense you'd have to know I'm sorry that's I'm blowing alright any of you ever heard me some of you have you know that I'm just blunt I don't play around in that way you don't go out the doors and I wonder what that guy's talking about because you know for sure the way that I say it the water and see if you would talk about God is your God not greater than you then you would be his God is that sensible you would be his God instead of him being your project see if the Creator is greater than the creation right so we know that he created us all right so then he's greater than we are so then that way we can believe that he's real he's just not a mythology's or a thought see we want it that away cause then that way you turn around and talk to your kids about Santa Claus you know and you tell them about a Santa Claus which is the mythology well then they get to the point they wonder if God is a mythology because they can't see God but they didn't see Santa Claus he's done it to store but just remember he's down at all the Walmart so there's four I mean probably hundreds of thousands of stores and he's in every one that's a pretty good Santa Claus but I don't care for that that much to you but my point is what you mean we want to make Santa Claus greater than God and you ask your kids to explain a lot about the world today and that could explain all of us but don't even know Jesus Christ don't even know his name don't even know who he is or what he hid we yet they can tell you all about the the Daniel Boone's and the Davy Crockett's of being in that realm of us older ones or Superman's or our Batman's and and you get the kids all built up into an area until they don't know what to believe well I'm not that away I want you to know what to believe see that's where I believe that there is just one true and living God in his name is Jesus Christ because he said I come in my father's name is that scripture within if his father were if his name was Jesus then his father's name would be Jesus that shouldn't be no problem see and on son father's in the line of of the name and his name is Jesus that's the only name God ever had because they could not pronounce even in the Old Testament that's giving you a quick run-through they've got the word they call it jvh you or you can be do two or three different spellings of that but what it simply means is they could not pronounce it there was no vowels ever how your English people are you know there was no I hey I owe you that landed there wasn't enough in there to be able to come up with it so they came up and they made the word Jehovah and they put it down trying to interpret that jvh you has to be in Jehovah alright and Jehovah beings like a father with his family alright see then it means he's not self existing anymore he's existing with his people I love it thataway he'll never be self existing again why because he has somebody to fellowship with but he doesn't want to fellowship with the world he wants to fellowship with his children his offspring to learn Palo Mars Hill we talked about you know in other words at Mars Hill they had all these gods sitting up there well then they had one little space probably little boxes or something and it says to the unknown God well that was just in case they forgot who he was you know or left him out so they might little space you know what Paul said he said that's one cow creamer and the unknown God I won't talk to you about is Jesus Christ he said Dennis Christ in you the hope of glory he didn't knowing that God is real is a very important part of the Christian realm because they're just even in thoughts and ideas or mythologies or what is your input is a great words we use today what do you think about this well we don't have no right to think about God you mean you can think about God and change his ways of do it no that's why I read that he said I'm God and I change not we'll see he's never changed whatever he was in the beginning he still is he'll always be that he's the eternal God he just brings himself down to human parts to work as human beings can understand him and follow her into that line and and see who he really is alright see then in doing that he didn't he's more real than we are he's not a myth he's not a doll he's a person he's a PE he lives in heaven he had to place to dwell he was that away before you and I ever come into existence but he was real not just a spirit floating around in the world of nothing's and all know where his heavens of heavens power was taken up to the third heaven and he said he saw things that were not able to even talk about them well how much further can God go so in the beginning get it out of your mind in the beginning we return in John in the beginning was the word right now what are you going to do because before it can be word it has to be a thought first right I know sometimes we run our mouths off I still I wonder if our brain keeps up but it's still not true the fact you can't say something unless your brain communicates with that part of you to make the talking so you have to think about it you don't sit down I think I'll say this and I say that no you're thinking it as you go when you're speaking from that part all right but see it's got to be first at all and then can't you see how real God is and we like I said we think about him as we've taught it well he's just experienced it why not bring him down to reality why not let him be real like he is and then it will get away from all of those ideas well you know I just feel you know what it is you know in the religious rims of how it is oh I feel the Lord I feel this I feel that's wonderful as long as the Lord which is also teaching in the religious realm that says that God is the good thoughts that you have and that's all he is but the devil is the bad thoughts that you have well that makes the devil just as real as God goes now you argue all you want to but you get a whole lot more wrong thoughts and you get good thoughts I don't care who you are you say I know I just think now you're lying be honest the devil gets more in road into the human realm that we are and he has a whole lot more controlling power in here than we allow the Holy Spirit to have even though it's living within us I don't know just be honest and just see how the devil can do those inroads if he could talk to the Lord Jesus Christ and offering bread offering this offering that offering the world don't you think he can all talk to us a whole lot all right now see then we've been trying to go backward in understanding and now we start in Genesis where it says in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth see now that was a worldly beginning that was a beginning of things not necessarily a beginning of time until sin entered the picture it was not recorded about time and doing even though the days you had read in Genesis 1 about the day one he created that who he created those are explanations they're not stating a day as a day because the day with God is a thousand years and a thousand years as a day so you you've got to get more than just twenty-four hours as a day time but just think about it my whole point has been to all of us is to do one thing think about he wasn't just you know we said okay now brother Dale we got away from being a spirit so now we just make him you know be real you mean he's gonna set now for millions of years by self and just twiddle his thumbs no he self-existing he's by himself - that's wonderful remember he's thinking you know this world is just God's thoughts spoken and brought into existence human beings people and whatever we think of ourselves are just the fact of what God thought of before the world and he spoke it and it comes forth why can't we accept it that way but can't we see that is that his thoughts are more real than we are over in Isaiah Isaiah says my thoughts are not your thoughts it says my ways are not your ways said my thoughts are so much higher than your thoughts until your thoughts are not even in the picture and he said my ways are so much higher until your ways is out of the picture see it's not just you and I to think remember the best we can think is just human terminologies and like the Prophet said when you read in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God that's as far as our human minds can comprehend but by revelation God's Word bringing it down to us we can go back pi-star go back into the eternity without thinking and to no one realized that he's real and he thinks he's is not set as I said setup to her you know Lilly Juun ain't got nothing to do I'm gonna board you no no and you believe God is being real how real is your God now quote the Prophet the way he stated he said God knew ever net that would ever be in the world and how many times that NAT would bat its eye that's getting close to infinite isn't it if we don't give him that ability to be infinite we think he hides and like I said and maybe it would be pretty good sometimes to have all this Father Son and Holy Ghost in some kind of a doctrinal ideal code may be somewhere between all three of them he might lose my sin he might lose Who I am and what I do it but I don't believe it teller was sure I believe in Father Son and Holy Ghost for that Lord Jesus Christ see that's why our baptism is not in father son and holy go your Catholic Church pact that down your throat all of the years I can show you in your own sight encyclopedia go home on your computer and running on your computer do it one time run in Nicean council 325 AD and see if that was not what they were doing they were changing the original way of baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ causes just one God the Catholics come up come in from Rome and as they come down from the natural pagan Rome to the what you call the spiritual Rome or whatever you call it religious Rome then they brought it up to many gods and they brought in Father Son and Holy Ghost simple to me Lord Jesus Christ Father Son Holy Spirit and see that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because there's no such thing as three gods your Catholic Church back that down your throats you go ahead and believe what they say but the truth of God will set us free see that's why there's so much in the Word of God that brings it out to where we can understand and there's like I said we go back and see how real God is you can't come on listen you can't prove there's a god oh and they've heard a preacher talk like that well is it true proving to me now you're going to have to use some form some wording some thought to be able to bring it down you can say all you want to God lives in need you know god lives in me I know he's real you remember what happened years ago there was a man named of livers Altizer that he back in the 60s I guess somewhere right in there he said God was dead well it just went everywhere oh boy everybody was getting all excited and everything cause the manege said God was dead the simple point was I checked it out his point was that God was dead in the lives of the people I agree with him 9 I agree in the lives of the people God was dead they didn't have a living God they don't believe God was dead because if god is dead where are we you understand we see that was his thoughts and man said you know that come on the radios and the preachers were free I know he's real because he lives in my heart well they're not living like the devil right and then my living like the devil I don't think God was in their heart sorry if that's all you got you got a flimsy excuse to try to talk about God to me to believe in one true and living God the best thing I can do is look back at humanity and see what God created see how he brought us you talk about a marvelous situation of bringing into existence like I said there I want to go about the dedication you realize and I know it's breaking down because of the immune system but you know babies used to be almost immune to sickness for for 6 months why because God had put in with him an immune system that it was broken down after it got into life can you tell me how that you you tell me how you live we'll find out whether there's a guard or not how do you live well I eat I do this will tell me how that food goes into your body comes out into blood cells and runs through this and comes through that makes all this work you realize all you got to do is block that heart for a split second and you're dead you mean all of this that works in the human you come on flow implying that you tell me how that a white man can give a black man a blood transfusion our vice versa it don't change the color of the skin it doesn't I mean when you go to the hospital you be you say I want to make sure that I get a white man's blood or the black foods I want to make sure to get the black men blood it might change something what's it going to change its blood the Bible said in one blood there's no glory in what we look like with somebody yesterday with the brothers are me the pigmentation of the color of your skin is determined by the environment you're around and the thing and as it does and it finally gradually weakens down and that's why it's getting worse and worse and mixing together but at one blood the Bible says he made all man well it doesn't bother to give a blood transfusion Lee do you explain that though I like the way the Prophet said it you explain to me how that a brown cow eats green rice and yields white milk I got lost our tumblr it looked like the milk would at least be green no you can't explain those things right but you can look at it and see God is real see how it really is because he created us and the Bible says we're good to adduce even more that he created us in His image well what was God to look like then he dwelt on the earth 2,000 years ago in the human body right you know that body didn't look no different we do we just remember one thing for certain Jesus was neither God neither Jew nor Gentile he was God Almighty he created a blood stream he was the only DNA of that connection all the rest of us connects back to Adam to her DNA but he's real that's all I've asked you to think about how real is your god a god that could run all of this universe like people have said you know to me about it said well if Jesus was God when he was a baby later who was running the world all he did in the Genesis he just focus it let it be it's been running ever since he don't have to get up every morning raise the Sun it comes up automatically why because he spoke at the beginning and speaking it in the beginning it's going to run that way until he speaks in some other way but see we limit him to our thinking I try to bring him to our thinking and your think I'm trying to limit him to that no I'm not limited to him to my thinking but I'm trying to bring him to our thinking to where we can see how really is and have it back in the beginning he existed own we had talks I emphasize this at every funeral that I've ever done I emphasize one thing to the brief to the grieving family it's hard to lose a loved one it's hard to let them pass on we just remember after a little while you'll start thinking about the things that you were doing and you'll be grieving about losing your daddy or your mother but then after a while it changes to from grieving to the point you thinking about the things that happened and you know you can spend the rest of your life thinking about the things action that we you would do your daddy in your mother you don't never sit down am I the only dumb it shuts down sometimes and just tries to think you don't ever just get you know you just said I own and you to think and you think about all of the things that you've been through in life all of your life and what you've done and were you doing who or you makes your husband that or you met your wife at or you've earned it where you found this and I'm you don't never think it's considerate I don't believe in in what you call the word sanitizing I don't know what that means just trying to build up in your mind to make something I mean just think about reality just think about where you come from what you're doing it can be funny even things that when you went through it in life it wasn't funny you'll never remember in school the things you kids used to do and then we adult don't want our kids to do things right we think they ought to be saying through it oh come on we wouldn't st. we had a calendar in a school and it had to put us together cuz it the whole building had burned down and we were rotating through and we had a calendar sitting about as far as the waller of all the presidents I mean we remember them well back this is this is in the 50s okay and then we had a calendar well the way they separated the room was a pegboard you know South board with the etiquette how hold it in take board come on kids come on adults what's it like ride we used to take a spool we took a spool just perfect let's get us a rubber band and we take a spool and we get us a pencil or a stick that would slide to the food and the teacher would be up trying to tell everybody and you'd hear it go I mean Abraham's eye goes out hello we could Life all evening about the things of life couldn't it now will you get the point then to do that you know what you're doing you're thinking when I Illustrated that you looking at then I got to see him doing that ugly Roosevelt on that that's you're thinking it's a wonderful opportunity to be able to think what would it be if it was taken away from us I've always said about my wife you know they worry about you taking in now when you get about 70 years old I take it in and and they take you 65 70 to take you into the doctor and the doctors got the nurses comes in and they got these questions asking and they say remember these three words CatDog hat well then they go talk for a while and ask you all about what you're doing and everything else and did it come back to what was in three words you know what they're doing they're checking to see where you go where you're crazy or not they're checking to see whether you got all Hummers or not and I told the people about it I said you need to worry about my wife No so you'll never die of all hammers because her brain never stops you can't go to bed at night I go to bed lay in the bed fall over two seconds I'm sound asleep three hours later I'm up maybe walking through the house I haven't slept a wink pray for me you know what the problem our brains running she never puts it on hold and says go to sleep are you following me what about your thoughts I'm jogging your brain to think about thoughts and ideas because to realize then that God when he was dwelling alone back before the world he had thoughts and his thoughts was his attributes attributes is what he was trying to display he wanted to be a savior but there was nothing lost he wanted to be a healer but there was nothing sick he wanted to be a father but there was nothing to me he wanted to be God but there was nothing to worship him and see then he was dwelling truly alone with histology of what he wanted to be he decided to be those things Satan didn't pull nothing over on God in the garden Satan was a part of the plan to get it all to going because it had to been a devil to make us go wrong we wouldn't know went wrong so he had to not make the devil devil and put him out he permitted him to come that was part of histology it was also a part of his South to know one thing for certain if he give me and you the opportunity we would go into sin don't blame Adam and Eve back Dyer remember they didn't have no new birds to help them but just remember he was thinking about what he was going to do and we talked about life as being you know they were enter in the seventh day is what we talked about seven thousand years under thing and see he was set back our billions of billions of billions of years before anything ever come into existence he had a lot of time to think it over you know what he could never have a new thought that's what I love about God he can't think of something and then turn around and change his mind if he ever tells you anything from the word don't worry about it they put your life on it and believe it just put everything on that if he ever tell you you read the Bible and believe it just believe it because he he's there's no way that he can think a different thought there's no way that he can change his mind remember melikhaya says I'm God and I changed not there's no way that God can change it's us to change and we want to make him to our changes instead of trying to make us coming to the point that he doesn't change and how that back in the beginning before anything ever existed at all he thought about this world and what it would be you know what it's going to be the way he thought it's going to be the way he thought I got a pen a associate meeting one day you know arguing over who was going to be president back two or three before you know and ever picture it got up you know in kind of way we do in the felon and each one was talking about I believe it's gonna be this I believe it's gonna be that I got up and I said do you want me to tell you who's gonna be President here so I said you know problem you want me to tell you who's going to be President or finally someone said hello I said the Bible says I put in Kings and I take out Kings whoever who he wanted to be President was going to be President I didn't know God run everything like that well I thought he did I thought he run every time if you don't believe it that way wanted the devil get it in his own idea to try to offer everything to Jesus if he didn't think he owned it the devil owns a lot of it but he knows there's nobody greater than him and that's the problem is trying to get as many people as he can on his side by our thinking you realized you're sitting there right now some of you're saying well I wonder what we're going to eat come on saying what in the world just got talking about some of your saying well I need to go do this because I get to I better write it down cuz I'm gonna forget it oh yeah that's our thinking but just remember we quoted you Isaiah I believe it's 58 I think I tried where he says my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not sure at all you can never have another thought from what he thought of it that's wonderful all you got to do is find it in the Word of God and believe what God said when you read in earnest and by stripes I'm healed put your name there say by stripes I'm healed ale is healed that's the word you know they do that and then he'll just take care of the healing why are you women out listening to thought just for a minute his thoughts are eternal and he can never have another different talk from that one that he thought so then we can believe it looking the Prophet said it like this he said this is now I'm holding up a Bible what is those letters on a page right we call it what the word right we call this Bible the word you know what that's God's Tallis then he put there you must accept it as for you well yet we look at it is like we like to tell stories out of it or this happened and that happened they were great things happen here but not thinking about who we are and where we're at and what's taking place why not the Bible is not written to a sinner listen to what I'm saying the Bible is written to Christians those that are in Christ Jesus the scripture said it's written through the center only in the basis of condemning him of his sin it's not to him it's only to condemning only to bring knowledge of sin in his own life within if it's to bring knowledge of sin and its own life why can't we believe it it's written to you and I and accepted as that and say thank you lord I didn't realize you were thinking of me we've seen that song you know about when he was on the cross I was on his mind that was reason is on the cross is because you and I were on his mind to pay the price right what about it what about life what about every day of your life and the things you realize the Prophet said it one day like this and I love to quote it he said our thoughts in heaven are louder than our words on earth with our mouth guns a whole lot on earth right in order to blabber a lot and has a lot of things to say but what about he he thought of it before you ever said it it's not going to be a Judgment Day when it comes up and God's got to put on the screen you know that a judgment he has to put up on the screen and said did you say that no he'll just bring it to your thoughts and there it is he doesn't have to put it up in front of us to tell us what we done we'll know our thoughts remember the way the Prophet expresses is not going to be the center at judgement it's not going to be no problem he's going to walk across and see who he is and know who is but what about that God that Jesus was talking about over should have not I cast out Devils and I named have not I done these things he say depart from me I never knew you but that'd be a horrible situation to spend all your life preaching the gospel and get up at the end of it and find out you're still lost you don't sound too good no because I don't make it too good we've been taught all of her life to become a Christian that takes care of all of our troubles no sir that's not right when you become a Christian the devil gonna point everything in the world he's got at you he's gonna throw everything in front of you you're gonna fight your way all the way when you become a Christian when you're of the devil you're just in his world and doing what he's done you remember that can I touch your mind actually just a little bit can you remember when you used to be in the world once you were doing you know what you're thinking right what about God thinking you see them is that real not mythologies in dollars he's real if you ever get it to the point to find out how really really is you will stop your thoughts and ideas of things I know a lot of people never experienced things to where they can see the reality of a living God but why not if you conceal - see yourself and know where you're at why can't you do it do you have to have some kind of a way or something for somebody telling you we love to listen to the Prophet telling about the way God done and told him this and told him that and would discern out the people in the congregation and tell them all I don't have to worry about it you see my Bible didn't die when the prophets died Hebrews 4:12 is still the same today that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I just don't have the ability to throw it back to you and tell you what you're thinking and I don't want it the times that I've had that I don't want it I don't want nothing like that because I don't want to know your thoughts I want to go away from you thinking that you enjoyed what I've had to say today instead of wandering her you know well he just keep trying to convert us ain't trying to convert nobody because it wouldn't do them good for me to convert he'd be about like it was in the old days when they told that you know they could pay for their sins and then walk this man walked up to this pillar and he said he was drunk laying in the street and he said I'm one of your converse he said you look like something I'd convert it wasn't God to convert it he just converted to a thought or an idea of a mankind and believed it how real is your God sometimes just take a moment you're in the bathroom you know once you spend more time shaving and doing of it you know that there's actually proven that there's more muscles strained in the bathrooms and there are out here weightlifting it's it you're crazy there's more muscle strained in the bathroom you're up in front of the mirror come on guys and you go look at this because my physique look a little loose then you turn around there's a big village thing oh let me turn sighs if you get this it away you'll tear up more muscles right away and you will out working out trying to get you to think and to get you to think of how real God is because he knows all of those thoughts before we ever have them you know what I love about him he can never have a new thought and all of his thoughts are eternal but you know like I said to her the other night about it some way then for me to say Father forgive me of my sins according to the Bible that says that my sins are put in the seal his forgetfulness never to be remembered again and he says as the far as the East is from the West see the reason it says that way you got a north and a south that's two poles you go so far and do you know stops it's north and south but when you say east to west you just start going west and Ida while you're coming back east there's no ending to it that's why it says in the Sea of his forgetful as he puts my fins you even know what to do that he has to have amnesia is that the word of today you know amnesia means you lose your mind I don't believe God lost his mind but he agreed and stated it and when he stated it that my sins would be in this interval let's see if we're get fulness that could never be remembered against me all I got to do is ask him to forgive me we think that we're going to hell because of this that or the other we're going to hell because we do not believe God in His Word if we believe him he'll make a way for everything you say yeah but I've done sin too long I've done this I've done that there's no such thing because you're still a human being that's a mortal alive you say yeah but but the Lord told me I was lost could have been the devil telling you that - you mean you don't believe it I believe in ascending away your day of grace right but as long as you're wanting to be saved there is no sin in a way of your grace it's when you come to the point you don't want to be saved no more and it's over with but think about it Church the point of and trying to get trying now to get God in his mind not at you and I was sitting back up in heaven with him no it was in his mind it was in his mind of what he was going to do with what the world would be like and what we would be like why does the Bible says you that you can't take one cubit however it is you can't add no now when today when the women cut you know men - excuse me that colors are higher but according to the Bible it says you can't do that but you can't add a cubit you can't do this can't do that about your heart when it tickles me is when you see the sisters and they dine it pretty good and then it gets into the scout and then all the other starts coming out and you look at the scalp as they go bonza you finding out the color that was original is down in below there so you can't add to it or take away right you say well you don't believe now ask your business and just say the Bible says don't cut it don't say nothing about coloring it don't cut it oh that's where it's real all right but listen he say that thousand people are jumping well I didn't say it the Bible did now he's causing you to think what I want you to do right now is to do one thing from the or anybody else is to think about how real God is come on musician think about how real God is and how he's trying his best to speak to your heart he's trying to speak to the inner part of you to get you to think it gets you to realize that you need a Savior what's the purpose of all things of God coming was to save mankind yeah but I've got too many things to give up to be you don't have to give up a thing to be a Christian you just become a Christian and it'll give up everything you don't have to quit this quit that you just let God come into your heart and your soul and he'll take care of it that's Christianity Chris we felt we teach Christianity you don't smoke you don't drink you don't chew you don't do this I smoke all I want to out you all I want to I drink all I wanted why because something happened to me a long time ago they took away that problem the Indies is coming to live and you're not we're trying to be a Christian and accept Jesus Christ that sounds funny why not quit trying to be a Christian and just accept Jesus Christ as your Savior because you're going to try to do everything you can by your mind and the iviews of your mind and you're going to try to say I can quit this I can quit that and you know what happened the lifetime you quit you know some of you that smoked and everything else you took in cigarettes and you throw them down across the field oh hang on smoke no more about three hours later you were out running in the yard looking for the Ducks and we old enough to remember them words you know what a duck is is what's left over from the cigarette the thing you throw away from the cigarette that you don't smoke all of it you throw it away that's called a duck while it's old commerce and you're out in New York trying to dick them things back up why because that demon is inside of you is crying out for smoke you know what all you got to do is just accept Jesus Christ and let him take care of it and it won't be anything that it won't be any part that you're trying to live it's not the head of Paul said it's not I'll Utley with the Christ that liveth in me he said in life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God I make this statement and people look at me I say I don't want you to be good now like alcoholic anonymous and stuff like that wants you to be good you make a good neighbor you know but that's no such thing in Christianity I don't want you to be good I want you to become born-again it'll take care of all the other things you're a funny preacher I agree with you but is it true just accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and let him come they didn't get into that mind because remember before the foundation of the world if you believe in what I try to bring that before the foundation of the world he was sitting there thinking about all the things that would ever happen in this world now let's be more personal to this for a second you realize you came here a lot of you came for baby dedication a lot of you older ones came because of this or that or the other some reason you realize God before the world knew exactly who's going to be here and you exactly who was going to be sitting where you're sitting and you exactly what I was going to be saying how do you believe God that real because that's the way I believe it if he gives us dogs and we transmitted his words remember God back there in Moses when Moses was sent out you know dart said to Egypt his words plagued Egypt Ryan broke flies fleas frogs but you know how it came he got the thought from God it was not a word God was leaving it up to Moses to speak it Moses said let there be flies and flies came because that was God's thought given to Moses don't worry about speaking what you believe to be true yes but brother difference you think you could be wrong about this out of the other why would I even think the thoughts are being wrong if God is real he'll correct me and he'll bring me to the right truth of it but I'm trying to just get down to the inside of you and I to think about how real God he is and how he wants to come and live in English this is not a good thought well I've had good thoughts and I I tried it for a little while and I didn't do no good that's what it was you're trying but you sit down and ask him to take over and see if he won't come and deliver you from view probably the staying together what will happen number 55 number 55 the black notebook you might have a need the alders open god is good all the time

terminologies see we're not going to just pray with you we're going to send you this with you you put it in your billfold you take it with you and you keep it right with you and then remember when you

part that he he's going to he's in the military and he's he needs you to take care of him and all the things and we know that there's a hard world out there that has to live in and do a lot of things we just asked you to go with him and be with him and take care of him along the way Lord and just speak to his heart and let him know Lord that you you are and just it all he has to do is accept you and let you Lord just come and live let you be the one that would take care of all times it'll be hard because it's human but yet it can always remember that somebody prayed for me there's a prayer clock in my billfold Lord we've seen so many to be that to wear that they take this and it would be to wear that it you would come on the scene and we thank you we love you in Jesus name okay evening
