inspired book I feel like traveling on you feel like traveling on this one amen might be tired but I'm traveling them foreign foreign foreign foreign service I won't stand Open the Eyes of My Heart going my heart Your Glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy always amen you love the Lord you can't break their shaking hands and didn't know y'all were singing good to be in the house of the Lord good to see each and every one of you here some of the sheep are here some have scattered usually when the pastor leaves a lot of others decide to take a vacation on that weekend but that's okay that's never bothered me because I'm where I'm supposed to be amen so same with you where you are is where you're supposed to be before the foundation of the world I knew you'd be here pray for us keep us in your prayers keep dad in your prayers good to see brother Chris up here playing the guitar amen just a wonderful time to be alive blessing to be here and brother Donnie if I'm nod see if you can turn that thing up it's a little warm or down I mean it's a little warm up here it's just a gallon I have to wear a sweater okay all right Mr Gail our thermometer and it's always on cold the everybody will turn to First Corinthians 13 we're going to kind of continue our thought with uh the true seed but we're going to look at partial to perfect this morning and then this afternoon I promised them down in the Sunday school class I had a question or two about about former and latter rain but we need to understand partial to perfect before we can understand former and a lot of rain all right because foreign lettering can be very confusing you're going to see this afternoon the profit starts out in a partial understanding of the former lettering and then he goes to a perfect understanding of a foreign letter range because Luther went to a partial understanding of the baptism uh he continued with father son Holy Ghost now that wasn't the perfect will of God that was permission will of God our partial will have done letting that happen allowing it to go on but remember one thing's for sure we got to come to Perfect Right perfect is what we got to come to and I want you to keep this in your mind look at the church ages we don't have them up here anymore look at the church ages there's no more little round balls I have to lay out of the set in other words there's no other Church aides left so as we read these scriptures today and as we read the scripture this afternoon remember one thing's for sure there's nothing nothing going to carry over into another age we're either going to fall or we're either going to be harvested and taken up or harvested and put into what the fire remember they come through and the Harvest they come through they harvest everything the the weeds go into the into the fire the wheat goes to the chafing floor and they go up and the weeds go down all right there's no other we can't Pitchfork this back to another age we either got to come to perfect realization or just like I was speaking of brother Mike ultes last Sunday and I didn't know this about a brother that had come in I was walking out like I start I'm starting to do now and I was back there real close to him and I said you're either of God or you're of the devil one of the two and he got them walked out so they went out from us because there wasn't of us but come to find out that he'd been having a lot of trouble he was he was um a little unstable and caused a lot of trouble in the church and brother Mike actually kind of thanked me for helping him on out the door so I've done that before but you know what that wasn't me that was God because I had no clue who this person was no I did not know the background I did not know anything that was going on so you can count that as my ignorance or is God doing it one of the two so First Corinthians 13. we could read the whole chapter here but let's just read verse 6 through 13. and let's bow our heads before we continue dear heavenly father we pray Lord this morning that you would one more time come by Lord and use us in a special way it should not be Lord one that stands by the wayside but Lord you'd be one that would be an active participant in the service you would take over lord in every mind and heart of every believer sitting here Lord would something would quicken in their life Lord the word that they hold on to Lord may it Quicken Lord May the ones that don't have life Lord may they realize that they need you father that this is a desperate time that there's no other no other age or no other characteristic of you that's left except for the going up of the Bride father we pray that you'd just be with the ones that are not here be with Dad as he ministers for Brother Richard just bless him keep him strong thank you for healing his body Lord now touch his throat that it'll be healed completely and you'll have no problems at all Lauren we pray now that you'd be with a missionary on a Foreign Fields just bless them Lord take care of them give them Lord's souls for their endeavor Lord you also said you sent the word and healed the people so if there'd be anyone here among us today the sick or needy father we pray that you heal them now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ may all sin and sickness be done away Lord that you can come in have preeminence total preeminence not just partial Lord but total perfect preeminence in this service father forgive us of our sins and Lord though we be a Castaway may you help these people Lord that you may give them light Lord that you may bless them Father and give them strength they're the ones that's not with us today Lord just take care of them wherever they may be lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen Lord much going to be a good service because we got up this morning we're getting ready to come to work come to work get ready to come to work and uh I went to the eye doctor and he gave me contacts and I either got the left and the right or the right and the left took me 20 minutes to get it in then I look cross-eyed so I had to take them out so now I got my glasses back on again so uh and then I told brother Joe I'd write my scripture backwards I wrote first Corinthians 16 verse 13 and it's First Corinthians 13 verse 6. to 13. so forgive me of my ignorance but uh and we were supposed to be here at 8 30 this morning to turn on everything and we got here after Terrence Alicia did so um it was not June's fault it was mine because I couldn't get those stupid contacts in mind but anyway just pray for us because you know wearing these glasses I have to have them for here but but from about brother aisle backwards y'all could be all gone and not know it it's just it's just fuzzy next one I go down the aisle now so I can see where you're asleep or not so if you're going to sleep be about from brother out back and I'll never know the difference until I start walking down the aisle again so but you just pray for me I I'd like to have contacts I don't like these classes but the contacts are a multi-focused contact so you can see out there and you can also sit here so they made them almost like bifocals now but but if you get the wrong one in the wrong eye or get them backwards I know a lot of you wear contacts you get them in backwards man it's like somebody with a needle sticking in your eye so I did that I got one in I got number right number my Right One In this morning popped in just like that it was backwards all right take it back out so anyway so First Corinthians let's have a little a little humor this morning and on my part First Corinthians 13. verse 6. Rejoice not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believe us all things hope is all things endureth see that th on the end of that that's ongoing you're not just going to believe one thing you're not going to just hope in one thing you're going to keep hoping you're going to keep believing you're going to keep enduring charity never failing but whether there be prophecies they shall fail we've had prophecy since the beginning of time right right so we're narrowing it down to the end time all right now we don't know the difference between the prophesying of the right or they used to not know the difference between the prophesy and the right left the only time you'll know it now is if you have the Holy Ghost all right they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away now Paul listen for we know in part in other words we know part we know in part and we prophesy in part which Paul did but when that which is perfect is come it had not showed up yet or he wouldn't have written that right but that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away now not thrown away because listen not thrown away and and and and and denying it or or letting it be just something that would throw in a trash can no it's a building block because look when I was a child he didn't deny he was a child when I was a child I spoke to the child he knew what he did when he was a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkling but then when I put away childish things that's what he said that's his whole thought but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face what when we put the childish things away we're going to be able to see face to face now this is the end time now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known and now I'll buy the faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity or The Headstone you may be seated in the Lord has blessings of the reading of the word like I said we're going to speak continue with the true seed not as true as in false we know there's false seed we know there's false Doctrine even in the message but we're going to come upon a statement where brother Ryan says out of the true sea will come a group not saying that that seed is not false because we're going to read some quotes here in just a little while let's do number one while we're at it that brother Bob if anything goes wrong today it's about the phone Bob black brother Bob black brother Bob black it'll be his fault s about he is the true witness we're going to read it in just a little while in Revelation 3 7. on ourselves now this word true is the same Revelation 3 7. you'll call it it does not mean true as in contrast was false it has a richer deeper meaning by far because remember Jesus he's talking about the faithful and true witness in the Legacy and church age and Revelations 3 14 he's saying not he was a false witness but it says the faithful and true witness all right the beginning of the creation of God and you and I are supposed to be the continuation of that creation it has a rich or deep remaining by far it expresses perfect realization and contrast to partial realization now back in the Philadelphia Nations come in the glory was drawing now what great love that age manifested for him then he talks about in First Peter 1 8 but look at the bottom partial realization will be made perfect realization complete realization Hallelujah we have been looking through a glass Darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been down from glory to glory not doing away with any of this I want you to realize one thing let's not do away with anything that's in the past because without because what Paul was saying he said when I was a child I spayed to the child in other words he remembers what he'd done right so he didn't he didn't say it that never happened no he just put that away he put that part of his life away and he built on that and that's what you and I I think some of us may be stuck in our journey but let's realize one thing but soon it will be right in the glory so we may be coming to church every Sunday from glory to glory from Sunday to Sunday but there's going to come a time like brother collie was talking this morning which was wonderful all these people are are giving this great Memorial to 9-1-1 which which we should I mean it wasn't those people's fault it was an awful uh you know it was a horrible tragedy but you know what we can't deny what the prophet said either America will pay for her rejecting the word of God Amen all right so America's going to pay for the rejection of the word of God how are we paying for it well that was part of it all right but that's but see that's only partial that's the only partial tribulation 9-1-1 was just a toothache compared to what's going to happen when we get out of here right so just remember that if that was horrible guess what's coming okay all right so I didn't say this and I'm not condemning America the prophet of God did and the word of God did so there's nothing we can do about it that's why I don't pray for America I don't pray for the leaders I I just pray to get me out of here because they're not going to do anything for me me out of here I'm not worried about what's going on in this world all right because one day you're going to realize one thing's for sure like brother random said he said you keep your home you're going to take the mark of the beast now I didn't say that he did right he said you keep your home you will take the mark of the beast that don't mean for us to sell our home start living in cardboard boxes no but when it comes let's don't go we've been told talk to me about today all that partial realization was in the past Luther had partial realization we actually have partial realization Paul Paul even prophesied himself that he had partial realization is that what he said he said I sleep through a glass darkling but soon face to face but well he didn't see face to face you and I are the ones that are going to see face to face right we're going to see it we're going to read the quote in a little while where brother round said Moses was partial realization David was partial realization man right those are great people but we're going to read that a little while in Hebrews 11. where all those people are waiting on me and you to come to Perfection to get them out of the ground all right look what's been bestowed upon us but we've gone from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and in his glory we'll shine we shall be like him wonderfully like him Jesus our savior Divine isn't that wonderful we are completing him that is true he would not lie to us about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we'll be all swallowed up in life then we will realize realization so we're not gonna realize realization until we're changed in its entirety because we're going to see a little bit later on how that even you today when you come to church today you come as partial and perfect if you're born again if you're born again you come as partial and perfect you say how'd that happen you're a human amen that's partial but if you're born again that's perfect amen so you came not as two separate people not as not as some schizophrenic but you come as partial what's coming oh okay you knew I was preaching today see you I was preaching today so we get back in the back but we were realized realization you say well boy this is pretty real now what's President been trying to tell us this is not real the real you is the one I can't see that's the real you that's the one I want to talk to today I see this guy work a lot we live among our people right and the congregation we pretty much know everybody's life and what goes on because if you'll shut up long enough most people will tell you then we were realized realization excuse me brother Joe if you'll pull up sorry for the bottom number two please all right this is the Greek Lexicon this is where we get the word true it's all athenos are that which is not only the name and resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name my name is Wade Dale I got a nature I got a partial but that's not my perfect nature because you see mine you see my partial nature but somewhere inside there's one that corresponding to the name in every respect now Luther not brother gay not in every respect Luther didn't correspond to the name because you baptized father son Holy Ghost right right see they didn't connect with the name but see when it comes from loose to actually the Pentecost to the idea signified by the name real true and genuine now not to say that Luther wasn't genuine but Luther was genuine in a partial sense Luther was the two shoots remember the two as brother Brown uh talked about the bride tree and read restoration of the Bride tree you got two shoots come up tell you what let's just stop for just a second yesterday I went over to the hunting club and uh tore up all the food plots and got it ready so that's kind of where I do my preaching you remember I used to preach to the lawnmower out here but jokes doesn't know some uh cutting the grass now but I used to preach all my good sermons to the lawnmower you just got the other ones so I was over there preaching to my tractor and uh thinking about things and I thought you know what I was going to talk about today and this evening the former loud rain too you know it doesn't matter it can rain all day on concrete and nothing will ever come up right right it can rain on plastic it can rain on this church but does this church ever grow no no right I'm talking about physical rain let's go spiritual now that I'm talking about physical rain so I'm over there digging these food plots up and I'm like you know if I don't plant a seed in this fertile ground man it was all just moist enough and turned up real good and got it all good and level and I left but if nothing was ever planted nothing's ever going to come up doesn't matter if you have a foreign ladder rain we'll talk about it this afternoon where brother Brown was really getting onto the latter rain people because they thought they had the latter rain and that was it but it wasn't they weren't really even in the form of rain because the former rain is the teaching rain all right but that's the same thing with true true as in the idea of signifying by the name real true and genuine if there's a real true genuine seed planted in that ground that thing when it rains on it former our latter is going to come up and we're going to also read that the rain falls on the just and the unjust so you know if I leave those food plots along over there there's going to be some weed seed grow up of its own but it's gonna it's going to Rejoice over the same rain but now people we got to get that thing separate you try brother Donnie downstairs talking about Believers May Believers and unbelievers you didn't know I've done it did um we'll have a searching around for some kids let me tell you something else you people that have children I don't care if they're 20 years old I don't want to see them running around walking around the parking lot during any part of the service and the old brother Dale will back me up 100 percent but I've done caught two or three or four walking around in the parking lot rambling around talking on their cell phones in the in the car now that's not respectful to the word of God that's not respectful to this church at 10 o'clock on Sunday school class is starting at 10 o'clock the services started now if you don't care anymore about your kids than that then you need to be in the altar today I don't care how old they are another Wednesday night I had to run two supposedly adult teenagers out of the break room downstairs or the things that I mean downstairs they were just Milling around a lot of service was going on so I don't care how old they are if I did that I want somebody to tell me because it's a soul that study you're responsible for them father's your response you know you're responsible for your daughter until your daughter marries a man right you heart brother Brown you are her Holy Ghost that's right you're the one that's supposed to keep her or him that's right I know my kid one of them comes here but the other one doesn't but when they were here they didn't roam around the yard while we were having service amen I don't care if they're 30 years old right we shouldn't be doing that right we come to a service to the house of God we come to be reverent you say cause trouble that's for you to discern because you know what it upsets me and it upsets me from trying to get a sermon when I have to walk downstairs and find some kids walking around and adults are setting up here setting Sunday school class or whatever so you need to talk to your talk to your family have a family discussion okay amen everything okay all right it's time to quit playing we gotta get out of here if you don't want your kids to go with you you're sorry individual I want my kids to go I give my own personal life to see my children saved before the Holy Ghost right now right now I will I'd love to give them what I've got but I can't I can only get them close enough to the Fountain so that that rain can fall on them and let and let them be watered by it let them see the life come on people but you gotta realize one thing realize them like Abraham did they're sitting right here right they're not out there in the world that's the journey when Dad was up here preaching and I was out in the world of sin did you think he worried about that no he just laughed and said no there'll be a time because he physically saw me sitting in a seat amen same way with your children moms dad husband wife whatever like your sister Brando she got desperate that's our problem we're just not desperate enough you know what we're not desperate because you know what we're doing when we bring all this together as in true as in as in we're trying to get something to the people he's saying well they did it in that age they did it you know we keep pitchforking this age has never been before right amen we've never had we've never come to this spot right all right we've never come to this spot right to take a body change so we've got to be different not be weird not being weird but be different right you know uh Jen's father's girlfriends last Saturday she came up to me and she said you know she said thank you for your stand now she drains and she you know does but she said thank you she said you're a living example see we could close and go home now I've done my job if you can realize that I never had to preach another sermon if you realize that this guy right here is trying to get us out of here and I said us I didn't say to me sure I'm worried about me but I'd go to every one of you make it than me and I'm honest my kids make it and you're not even pay me a bit of attention from now on just bring my kids in and give them what I think I say if that's what it is I mean I've been sitting here for 12 years watching and waiting for my kids to come Abraham waited 25 years and he got older and it was so more and more impossible see I'm not trying to birth children but yet I'm trying to get somebody the new birth all right which is much more important than a physical birth but now as we get them in as babies they've got to grow right they got them a tour that's what we're talking about today when you're born again you start as a partial realization you realize something different you realize and Paul even Paul being a prophet he realized that he was impartial realization but that which is perfect has come languages in part will be done away with not done away as in you're not going to take everything you know and throw it out no it's a building block to what's coming next all right that is already told you about former lab rain but we're going to kind of break it down this afternoon but look here and see this let's go to number two a listen to what the prophet has to say about Philadelphia Church age now he's talking this one he's talking about Revelations 3 7. since this word indeed expresses perfect realization he's talking about the truth that's against the idea of partial realization as Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before Listen to What a prophet says as never before we should be understanding this we can Now understand it never before anti-top contracted with type and substance with Shadow take the example now of Manna From Heaven now what was Mana partial realization Mana would fall if you hold it over another day it would rot correct right now when they win and ate the old corn of the land what was that type of perfect realization all right because it was the actual colonel right what man of the man of ceased when they got into the promised land and then they started eating of the old corn of the land which was what matured corn plant it wasn't Luther with two stalks sticking up like I said before you don't go out there and you know and plant my food plots we spend hundreds of dollars and we start seeing it all come up brother Colleen and we go out there and spray it with Roundup or or go out there and say man I got it right here's corn this is corn no it's not corn amen partially it's corn right it's a shadow because down underneath that soil was the original seed right that Original Seed had to break moisture break open two shoes but that was partial to understanding Luther had a partial understanding of the word of God but now look take the example now man from Heaven God sent down Angel bread now it was Angel bread it had every nutrient they needed in that little bitty wafer man so it's not false but it wasn't the true food that they should have lived on right everybody understand this I know some of the older ones we all heard this before but we got a lot of new people they need to come on up a little higher okay like me brother calling and Brother Don you're not right but that might affect them and sustain them right but why did it cease grow up babies grow up babies I'm not gonna feed you hand to mouth anymore you're gonna have to plant that corn seed now water it nurture it check the weeds out of it and when it grows guess what you'll have exactly what I'm going to give you which is a ear of corn and that's what they ate they ate the old corn of the land but he's not good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day now this is in this is in natural settings if it was left around it became what contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven thereof Mana was just a type and if any man eats a bat bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again spiritually he does not need to come back and eat it again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed is reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation now that's where a lot of people in the message take it that Luther didn't have the Holy Ghost and Wesley didn't have the Holy Ghost because they were under reformation and that was partial now remember partial is still real partial is still of God all right Moses is partial and Jesus is perfect that didn't make Moses fault that's right that didn't make Moses have nothing Moses was almost he was close to God right he was guarding the people right Christ in Moses doing the work so guess what thought a lot of him he brought him back and let him tell Jesus what he was going to do with his second coming right all right so he thought a lot of Moses so Moses even and when we talk about getting into a little bit about partial don't think that that is degrading those people they were they were put in a position had to come up two stalks first right two little green shoots had to come out of the ground why should the rain could run down and start a stalk that make this fall no it's a true part of the plant but this had to grow that's right God didn't want it to stay like this two little green shoots right he didn't want it to stay there he don't want you at the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a newborn baby he don't want you to stay as two little shoes because that's what happens to you in your birth you're a little baby and all when the wind blows and when somebody crushes you you know you say God pick me up welcome thing you know you go ahead and cut the grass grass grows you go out and step on the grass and it bends over guess what happens the next day that thing's right back up all right so you know it doesn't matter about all the things we go through Winds of darkness and all those things there's a shoot trying to come out there's a stalk because you can't put the corn on the end of this bug here you can't put the corn on the end of this too heavy won't work so you gotta have stock man guess what a little more rigid sanctification clean and set aside this guy for service stand up don't lay over like a baby stand up be a man because you know what as this remembering justification that's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you can you can these two little shoots can look just like grass weeds um corn it can look like any kind of vegetable it can look like in hardly any kind of weed when it's right like this but when that thing starts to stop coming up you realize one thing it's not just grass right it's not just grass something happened to that plant it's growing up amen it's being more rigid it's able to stand on its own right of the roots are getting deeper that thing rocks a little bit guess what brother Brown said that just make loosens The Roots up so the thing to dig a little more so the Winds of Darkness don't worry about them they're gonna blow but guess what when that root gets a little bit deeper what's it heading toward it's heading toward the water it's trying to get to the waters trying to get the nutrients out of the ground so you've got this the second part which is the stock that comes up no corn on that got to have all these other things that come out gotta have that tassel what is the tassel do the tassel looks a little bit like it but it's forming more in the perfect because you watch your corn come up you watch the tassel come up to the top I'm talking about a regular piece of corn not just wheat now let's take corn but what happens is that gives off pollen that gives off um things that's coming out of the top don't they look like corn but then all of a sudden you see something coming out the side and it looks kind of like my hand looks like corn it's in baby form right that's why that we we realize that there's baby forms of our journey that we got to get out of if you stay like this and you're supposed to be a corn you sometimes happen you grow spin stunted you don't have enough water you haven't got to a fountain you hadn't gotten the roots deep enough all right but if you ever get that see that's partial salvation it wasn't that Luther didn't have salvation it was just part of God for that time which is partial that means part that's what partial really means it's part right all right let's part up partial not perfect we'll read it in just a minute we'll see what partial means and you'll get a real good meaning of this but don't pull it up yet no need for a partial salvation here is the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God Amen now this starts us on our journey our partial form right but now here's the perfect form now if she is him she the bride it's him that's what I was talking about this past weekend realize one thing folks I know there's mate Believers True Believers and unbelievers but there's really only two types of people that's Believers and unbelievers because you're either you're either not if you're of God or a part of God or if you even want to act like God you're the devil you're anti she works coming to man God winked it at Luther's ignorance he winked at Wesley's ignorance what the ignorance of there was not enough light shining on the word to be able to read and see that that the Revelation is not father son holy ghost that it's Lord Jesus Christ amen right right no eternal hell somebody told them we'll read it in a minute we'll see because Watch What Happens this can create a denomination this can't that's right that's where we're coming to in the service that's right because we are we are very close very close from being a denomination in this message or being of God Amen all right next one please either half the kid David he's still he's still going through the thought this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phase he that is true if you want to read it we'll just save time we'll not read it Revelations 3 verse 7 he's talking about being he that is true and hath the Key of David Christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization here it is Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus likened to Moses was the prophet of God William Branham was not the prophet he was a prophet Amen brother Branham was partial this might hit you hard okay not gonna hit you but but he's dead he prophesied he died he had partial realization but he was so close to perfect realization what he said is going to change us so so the greatest Prophet That Ever Walked on the face of the Earth outside of the Prophet was William Brown No Doubt no doubt in my mind you can't talk me out of that why because he brought like brother dick said it doesn't matter what they say about that man he took me to an understanding of God that no one else has ever took him that's right same way with you and I right he took us to an understanding of God on well above anybody else even Moses because he took what Moses said and made it real to me and you he took what David said he took what Paul said and made it real to me and you all right David a man after God's Own Heart was king of Israel but Jesus is the greater David king of kings and Lord of lords God very God now David was born of the tribe of Judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the shoe bread reserved for the priest he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of Christ but he was a type of Christ he wasn't Christ now Christ within Moses doing the work but Moses was the type of Christ he was a Christ that's right all right now what's gonna what's the difference though in these people Moses David Hebrews 11 will tell you turn to Hebrews 11. I know this is simple but we're going to we're going to see something one of these days and it's going to strike our heart and we're going to realize why we're here Hebrews 11. we're not going to read it all but by faith all these people in this scripture it's not brother Joe don't worry about putting it up I just thought of this just now all those people in that scripture the very icons of faith we may call them the uh that's the that's the faith Hall of Fame and mind your name's not in it because we hadn't come yet right read all those names verse 38 of whom the world was not worthy for them even to be here they wandered in deserts mountains dens caves Earth and these all having obtained a partial report can we say that not change the word of God they they had a good report amen but it was a partial report why if it would have been a perfect one Paul wasn't a row what he wrote afterwards huh and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise what is the promise the promise is unto you and to your children to them that are far off even as me as the Lord Our God shall call what Peter said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is your production I promise amen amen right that's right repeat I'm waiting to baptized name of Jesus Christ for a mission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promise isn't to you to your children then to the far off your children there's another promise your children it's unbelievable that people can't believe for the children when the prophet said if you can't believe for your children I doubt you're even saved yourself that's right he's checking up time people harsher realization is okay listen to me look me in there partial realization is okay Paul said partial was okay but that which is perfect is come that which is in part will be done away let's finish reading it having obtained and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise what the new birth they weren't born again God God Almighty having provided some better things for us that they who all those people and now as brother dick says and I agree 100 now you can put Paul and all the church ages all the church age Messengers including William Brown put them all in that group right because they're dead they can't do anything more on this Earth for me and you that's right all right God having provided some better things for us that they without us and I circled that in my Bible and wrote me that they without me should not be made perfect that's pers that's perfect realization they lived in partial we're supposed to be living in perfect realization as it's supposed to be all right so you kind of got to know where we're going now pull up number two B please I want you to look at this I just found it this morning this this morning actually praise Lord I want you to look at this partial first word that's what happened when you stay in person in partial realization you have doubt you have fear right Luther head doubt now listen let's get the human part out of the way we all got doubts in fear human but doubting the word of God should not be part of this perfect man now in the word of God should not be a part of the perfect man but look doubt judge but it also comes to discern contend waiver I guess that's miscellaneous to separate make a distinction discriminate to prefer I don't find a quote I don't know if I give it to brother Joe and then but brother Brown said partial realization creates a denomination and that's and then what that is separate make a distinction discriminate if you prefer to learn to learn by discrimination Luther learned what he learned from the Catholic Church right is that not right Luther learned what he learned from the Catholic Church we're going to read a quote this afternoon where brother Ram said Luther was the latter rain from the Catholic Church whoa but he come out as a reformer to try to reform the people and make them not born again if they accepted Luther's message and a message for their data suggest shall live by faith they were born again believers they had a group in that age that was born again does everybody understand that even though they were in denomination but really see remember Luther didn't create that denomination who did the people behind him the devil got into the people behind him when he died and couldn't couldn't protest anymore when he died and went away same thing with brother Brown I've always told you before they don't want brother Brown to come back brother Bennett Brothers came back they really don't want that to happen and I'll tell them that they really don't want him to come back a half for three quarters of the church is in this message churches in this nation he'd drive them out amen but you know what I've always said even if he did come back you know what Jesus came back he was here for 30 to 40 days and you know what you know when they told Peter this is his disciple they told Peter that Jesus had risen he went fishing you went fishing right right his brother called he died and I looked down and saw that guy sitting laying in that casket and then about three days later he appears at my house and walked through the wall don't even open the door Peter had partial understanding right right Peter had partial understanding but see on the day of Pentecost he had a perfect understanding of his partial you got to remember one thing there's only one perfect one and that's Jesus Christ and there's only one perfect age and that's his age so they all had partial understanding but it was a perfect understanding of the partial right that make any sense it was a it was a perfect understanding of the part that God had given the partial that God had given all right to withdraw from one another denomination so to separate oneself in a hostile spirit to oppose strive with dispute and contend to be at variance with oneself hesitate doubt who wants to stay impartial I mean now let's go to perfect the word perfect it's perfect man and look at this one right here a full age amen brought to its end brought you didn't do it yourself he brought you brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness perfect that which is perfect consummate human integrity and virtue of men full grown adult a full age Armature now who wants to be in that group yeah I do tell you but you know what at one time you were in the other group yeah that's right at one time and you know what if you're born again and you're in that group God still pleased with you we're not drawing little circles we're not drawing everybody else out that's right and I want you to get something right here out of this message group that we've got now God's gonna bring our group out of that amen because out of the true sea true not his in fault but out of the true seed we'll read it in just a minute will come a group that's going to not be different because we don't want to be that denominational way of saying well we're just going to separate ourselves what happens in the message it's hard to get in some of these churches because the pastors won't let you in believe me I know that and I can pick them out in a heartbeat they don't want their people to know nothing except what they preach now I've seen it 100 times so what are they doing they're making their own denomination until they're South may have some true people in there but see what the problem is is they are usually money hungry and are either just got a very small group and if if the Lord sparked something in in somebody's life and they hightail it out and go somewhere else all those people are they're hirelings people they're hiring profits Balaam was a prophet of God he could get an audience he knew how to talk to Dodd right that's right but he was a hireling he needed some money to do what he was doing another motive all right so I know that's not in this church but I want you to realize that's what's happening and that's why these things are happening in other churches because if somebody did come in and preach the true word of God in its perfected form we got to start believing that we gotta believe that we got to believe that we are listening not me not me doing the preaching we got to believe that God put us here to listen to a perfect word right that America comes from brother Donnie or brother dick or me whoever it comes from the Dale obviously doesn't matter what matters is there's no big ones Among Us there's no great one there's no well this one's much better than this one you see that in a message too to me that they're floundering so close to a denomination the Bible said come out of her my people in a message church that's what happened people getting get a birth if you get a birth I'll promise you you may flounder impartial you may have doubt and fear and anxiety about the word of God right but if that thing ever ever Rings true one time I'm not saying that to be an isolationist no no no but if it ever Rings true you know what Fountain to go to that's right you drink out of 20 Fountains of water and if you got one one it just man stands out Above the Rest it's not that they're all water not what someone's water some not no they're all water right right but one tastes a little bit better than the other one does so that's why that we we don't want it and I don't want to sound like we boast here at Lulu but I promise you one thing we got it better than a lot of people got it let me just put it that way I've been in a lot of places a lot of churches a lot I know a lot of people and I know what they're preaching I know what to teach but we you'll never be able to say on the day of judgment that I wasn't taught that all right because that's being taught here we've got to come to Perfection but you got to have a perfect word to get it there right right all right you gotta have a ladder rain of maturing rain sure the former rain is going to fall we won't have any service this afternoon I'm going to bridge service now we're gonna have a former rain the teaching rain to get it ready but that rain stops do you know if it rains all the time your crops were rot that's right yeah that's right you know if God gives you everything you want you're right amen so he's going to let you go through a little bit of dry season to do what what does the dry season do it matures you if it rained all the time it flood your crop that's right that's right don't worry people can we get over there that's when the flood's gonna happen right I mean here when that's here when we get to the fullness the Perfection that's when the flood is going to happen because what the flood's going to do is it's going to take the inside rain that you've been receiving and it's going to change this outside guy right it's going to make this partial that you're living in it's going to make it perfect so if I'm partial to perfect so no we're not going to have rain for three months usually takes about 100 days for a crop to mature you get a form of rain and then the rain Seasons you might get a little shower every once in a while but that Harvest rain and now here in our country it's in like close to August I mean close to October remember our October is our harvest season but over there in about June is when their latter rain or there there's one more rain comes what does it do it helps the plant come to maturity anything that's lacking during that time that rain will mature whatever it needs those nutrients and make that corn in the tassel and make it real full all right so that's what we're in now we're in the perfect we we're bringing it to its end we're finishing it wanting nothing necessary to completeness that's a lot of people's problem they want it a lot of them don't know where to go to give it but they're still seed I don't count anybody out like brother Brown said just give me about two minutes for somebody and I'll tell you whether you're born again or not well that don't take discernment you start talking about something you know what kind of mind the person's got or what kind of doctrine that they have or what's going on in their life foreign let's go to number three go down go down to the bottom because look what we're going to read this this afternoon hold it right there hold it right there go back the scripture this afternoon is going to be Joel 2 23-26 so you can write that down but it says be glad you children of Zion now look Daughters of dying children of Zion who's he talking about one more time all right all right right so I want you to realize something every time you see that in the Bible it's talking about you right it took a prophecy to open that up bro you took a profit because that's what God was saying you children of Zion he didn't say bride in the end time because he hid it from the wise Improvement and revealed it to me and you you know why because we needed it Luther didn't need it they may understand Luther didn't need this Wesley didn't need this it wasn't that it wasn't there it was here Wesley actually had it in word form Luther and then We're translating it so Wesley had a physical Bible the Pentecostals had a physical Bible and all these other denominations have a physical Bible but what have they done with it they've done just what it says about partial they put doubt in it they put fear in it they put separation in it but be glad you children of Vine now just I'm like a lawyer now strike that from the record but you'll keep that in your mind for this afternoon go to the bottom I'm gonna read right here now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started a Reformation the Wesleyan age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore now not saying they were wrong he didn't say they were wrong he said they just didn't restore what's he doing brother random read that scripture Joel too click bride and end time that's where his thought went to now it says that God's going to restore the Pentecost ladies and not the store but God has to restore for he cannot denies word amen amen this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost at the beginning now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration why I will restore all the years that the one because the the let me put it this way the value of the word was eaten down the word was not eaten down but the value of it is that okay partial understanding right now like I said before it's kind of like a binoculars you put binoculars up you know I mean you can see real good in a certain spot but you can't see anything out here well that's what Luther was looking through what a glass darkling he was looking through a a two Power Scope well everything behind us kind of like me I actually clear now to about brother Chris but I went back a little further it's a little blurry but you know what as I walk closer that gets more in focus but that's still blurry partial the perfect that's what Luther that's what Paul I Paul and other words here let me tell you what Paul was saying Paul's saying I can see there's a people coming a word is here Paul was so positive he said you'll be judged by my gospel now what's that doing that's taken from Paul right to the throne of judgment right you'll be judged by my gospel that's where the judgment's going to come from but there's a group of people in between Paul and that judgment that's going to catch what he was talking about that Luther didn't catch that we actually didn't catch that Pentecost didn't catch not saying they were wrong let's go back one more time because if you took those two shoots and plucked them up threw them away you got nothing but somewhere in the DNA makeup of those two Shields are the cell structure of those two shoots was what a stalk right somewhere inside that struck sound structure of that stock was an ear of corn every Apple that I've got an apple tree this year that just God has blessed I've got two pair of trees that God has blessed them up till their arms are hanging down but when I planted that tree every pair that was ever gonna that's hard to understand in human brain but it was in that first little seed somewhere you know when God planted in the Garden of Eden you know everything that we're living at now every the the zillions of Blades of grass in this world came from that one place every oak tree that you see well Pines we're in the state we're in a state where we got a lot of pine trees but you look out all over this world all the pine trees come from the Garden of Eden what was created there from what let every seed bring forth of its kind all right so somewhere in in our I was telling them the other day in our DNA structure somewhere not what Mom and Daddy brought you that's partial right but when you're get when you're born again at baby form when you get the Holy Ghost and God just absolutely comes to you and washes you and and gives you the Holy Ghost and gives you a zeal brother Rams you've got everything you need right but that's still partial that's right right everything that baby needs at Birth five fingers on each hand all right but that DNA structure is not made to stay where it is but yet that's all the DNA that that child will ever get right it'll never get another DNA from somebody else that DNA makeup of that whole child is inside that little bitty baby right so what you do you feed it and it does what those five fingers just go from about this long to about this long you tell me one thing we were talking about this last Sunday the body you live in now in a human Fallen condition is still almost perfect think of all the functions that goes on in your body while you're sleeping right that's so involuntary you never even you don't have to go brief Breathe Me me no so even in a even in a sinful loss condition that partial close to perfect so close that you can't separate them because one day that perfect is going to take this partial and change it change it not not separate you brother call it no you're not going to die you're going you're going into change of the body all that black hair that I saw that was from about right here back it's going to come back we grew up together haven't we been but but see that we realize that like brother Claude said when he saw June tonight when we have her surprise birthday party he saw me and Janet 18 to 20 years old he'd never seen this attack before so we saw us at 18 to 20 years old and he was just crying like a baby and he told the church out there he said I saw them the way I'm going to see him when the body change happens that's why we got that thing downstairs for that the people that we love you we haven't seen when you were 18 to 20 years old a lot of you we have but that perfect is going to take over that commercial amen amen and it's going to change it it's not going to take James Cauley out of here and and put him in a new one over here right no he's not going to take this Earth and destroy it no this Earth was made for me and you didn't have it that's right in our book of Isaiah all right let me get back to this but our bodies are almost perfect a locust cake war and caterpillar pump worm have eaten all but the root and small bit of the stem now we're told that all these insects are all one the same in different stages boy would you like to put the four horseraders in there you could do it because you got four horseriders you got four Spirits getting destroyed you got four Spirits just bringing it my four steps of the Same Spirit that's bringing the back just in case the sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and the word the word's got to be with short in the end times now just give us a holy ghost to believe this right here all that's got to come here for restoration see where were we now we are told that these insects are one in the same in different stages that is right they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine so you can don't worry about organization denomination even thoughts doctors in this message but sits Through the Ages and that poor little rooting stop is going to be restored God isn't going to plan a new church God's Not Gonna plan on you James Colley he's going to take what he planted originally and he's going to restore it God isn't going to plan a new church but he's going to bring his original planting back to Original Seed he is doing it as stated in verse 23 we'll read it this afternoon by the teaching or former Reign next we'll come to harvest rain are rapturing faith now in that partial we didn't see anything about faith did we it was doubt fear separation um all those bad things but perfect is that rapturing face all right go to number four but that's in the gates of the enemy I'm not reading these out I guess I should tell you where they're at because some people that are listening know but now look let's don't make this so natural that we get carnal about it but Abraham did have a seed true seed which is his true seed his personal proceed was Isaac right right because Isaac came forth from him right but it was not the promise right I'm additional right Ishmael came out but Isaac was the one that was promised but I don't believe that the true Seed of Abraham will fail why do you say true seed Abraham had seed Abraham had seven children after he had one but it was only one promise like in the same in the church ages there's only one promised Church age that's going to come to perfect realization but I don't believe that the true city of Abraham will fail they'll stand just as gallant and loyal as Abraham did him did but More's Original Seed then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ The Beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them everybody say that with me through them through them buy them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word Luther didn't do that Luther couldn't say that he didn't fulfill all the words Brother Richard Marlo he did Wesley did not fulfill all the word of God Pentecost didn't fulfill all the word of God but look they were a part of the word of God Amen amen partial p-a-r-t partial they were part of the word but perfect is what we're looking at and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word and the Virgin who knows no man-made Creed our Dogma The Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him now who's you doing this through don't forget that part out there he's doing all this through a group of people he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb now he's talking about Jesus himself Jesus came from Mary's virgin womb right Spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accepting his word being unto me as thou has said though it was said by an Angel while it yet was written word Isaiah 9 6. they will love him love his and will have this potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of Christ was his now let's go to number six look hurry this is Harvest Time 1964. look hurry there must come a true seed now he's not saying there's not seed on the Earth Pentecost had a seed right the word of God remember the little statement that I that I that I uh give you last time the word that you were supposed to fulfill God had that waiting on you he knew you'd want it there so you drew it right out of the word of God well Luther was the same way that Joshua led by faith God in Unit A Man Called Luther was going to grab that and distribute it among his people they're going to catch it and become Born Again Wesley was going to come in with sanctification same way up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that was only partial but they had a perfect Holy Ghost there's not a partial Holy Ghost okay the only way you can be this and this is the only problem we have in the end time is called anointing ones there's where you make Believers come in that's why that third group comes in as a make-believer the true Holy Ghost can come down and anoint the rain falls on the just and the unjust and they can grow and like I said a weed seat a weed a weed seed and a wheat seed would look the same down here but let them just keep manifesting this one's going to start growing thorns and and and things and and pushing people out and you reach and get them in there they're untouchable well you can take that one a long way look hurry there must come a true seed there has just got to be because he's coming for the bride without spotter wrinkle he's coming for it a word Vindicated bride oh she'll be such a little bitty group let's see look at look at paragraph 298 but see the bride is going to be made up of all down through that had the word in their age it's not just this last group God is going to take the whole thing out of here it'll be so small be surprising they'll come up missing you won't even know they're gone what if you took 500 people but the secret coming but now remember we must add not add to the word of God or add to the prophet's message he's not just saying that the bride's going to be made up all down through and they're all going to be the same no his point his text is there's a true seed gonna come out of that hmm to fulfill Hebrews 11 40. a perfect group a complete group a group without spot or wrinkle if you and I are Miss Jesus and we have his potentials potentials then whose fault is it that we don't have them powers I was telling them this past weekend you know when you have an act of a play if we we used to go to the to the Passion Play Now what if they would have practiced that play which they do for months they have to now there's such a wonderful production and there's really if they make a mistake you wouldn't know it but when they started acting the play out Jesus was missing the whole thing is built around the crucifixion and they start their play Jesus is missing do they complete the play no they couldn't complete the play because the actor was missing the man that portrayed Jesus was missing then they look over there well where's the one that played Mary well she's missing she'll be here in about 15 minutes she's supposed to be on stage then all right well Jesus well he's been here by 15 20 minutes he wouldn't do something he'll be right back my point is the play could not even begin the play cannot even begin to end because you gotta start before you can finish now this is what I believe I believe now that all the actors of the play that we've been rehearsing for two thousand years six thousand years all the Old Testament prophets have done what they were supposed to do and they're gone all I said all all of the seven churches Messengers have come and did what they were supposed to do and they're gone it's like God has just left us alone to try to figure this thing out but no the director has got everybody on the stage that's right I believe all the 144 000 is Alive and Well somewhere in the world I said somewhere in the world the two witnesses I believe they're alive and well somewhere on this Earth this is how close I think we are not 40 years from now not 10 years from now not five years from now if you got the 144 000 on the stage see 144 000 wasn't hearing losing today they weren't all hearing brother Brown that's right or the age that he was alive right right the two prophets who knows but I know one thing's for sure you and I weren't in the message most of us in 1916 61 and 62. so that part of the actors had not shown up yet that's right now gathered amen 144 000. the bride the word that's why brother Brown said in 1963 he said all I can see is left the coming of the Lord now he was prophesied but I say today in 2011 there is nobody that's supposed to appear it's not sorry that's not already on this Earth that's right I just believe that because I feel it Amen brother 144 000 they're getting ready yes but they cannot come up without us going up right right amen the two prophets can't receive their message without us leaving that's right so guess what this whole thing is holding up on me and you listening to become true see sure you may be true seed I believe both Tom was two things amen but something in in in the Providence of God kept that partial from being perfect and you and I if we keep going any longer and it's not just you buddy just you just happen to be standing there if we go on another five years you know we were talking this weekend about a lot of the old people brother Carol a lot of those in their 80s if God don't come in the next four or five years we're gonna see others go so guess what as long as I'm alive and well that's what that's what the Bible says which are alive and remain I like that live in remain part that's me and you we're alive and remain right now we're alive we can do something about this thank you brother the partial to perfect now this afternoon we'll dig into a little bit more and show you a little bit about the former ladder rain because it's very important that we understand that because it's a part of our growing process the rain is the Holy Ghost we got to understand what comes for and what come ladder but he's going to pour out his Spirit it says on All Flesh in the end time so the only way you're going to be able to tell make believers is give them the word test give them the word test if you give them the word test right right you'll find out whether they're one or the other and I promise you we're at the Harvest rain this is my last point the teachings went forth brother Brown sewed the word down we're reading spoken words Original Seed he said pure and unadulterated now what are you not going to do about it you and I must react to that and become part of it if not we will continue in partial realization and God will have to take us out here but that which is perfect has come that which is in part you're not going to see the old Gary like the old gear used to be you're not going to see the old way like it used to be if you do the things that we did in the world if you're going to see those things then we weren't part of even the the beginning of of the we weren't even seed to begin with right but that's my whole my whole driving point is to realize one thing this thing is almost over the actors are on the stage they're not being called and I don't believe that they're practicing I believe the play is getting ready because brother Brown said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here what she's doing here in other words the actor knows what to do once the play starts and she'll be an invincible Army that's our problem we're wandering and wondering was about this and wondering about one of my be a Christian start with being a Christian that's right start with being a good guy good girl start with just being a Christian come to church read your Bible study the word of God study to show yourself a present don't be like let's don't be Catholic let's don't say brother Dale pray for us do all the praying do all the studying we'll just come sit down give us three Hail Marys and go home no that's not us people we all fall short but there's one thing you can do about it you know I was thinking while I was playing on the Garden or the play on the food plots yesterday about the devil you know the bride is an invincible Army right that's right there's nothing in the Bible that says that Satan is invincible there's nothing in the Bible that says he has all power there's nothing in the Bible that says that he's this he's this great being even though he's next to God's brother again even though it's next to God never in the word of God it says that Satan is more powerful than you are if you're born again because listen to this listen to this resist the devil and he'll flee from you I like what brother Claude said brother Claude said Satan must be bald headed no teeth and no hair on his chest because brother Brown said faith and hair on his chest Faith had teeth and Faith had hair on his head so Satan must be bald Toothless and no hair on his chest so remember remember what brother Brown remember that guy said boo it was the devil and what he said he was Satan he said he said Booth he said I just said blue back he said he just got smaller and smaller why does the Bible say one day we're going to walk by this guy and look down as like a bum sitting on the side of the road and say is this the man that brought Nations to its knees that's right is this the man we're gonna Wonder in Wonderland why we let that God torment us when he has no power except what God gives him no power he's powerless true C partial to perfect your newborn Christian pray to God give you perfect understanding if you're along in the way pray to God get you out of the way but pray that God give you perfect understanding because without perfect understanding we're not going to get out of here this partial man is going to steal control and going to take over and we're going to die and go by Grace but one group of people out of the true sea is going to become a group of people that's going to take a body change let's sing something 98 Inspire book Let's worship you have a need I'm watching just waiting right away oh my heart is there with the Rapture as I layer the words again if our Lord is coming back to Earth again Satan will be like that's coming back will be the answer to her so Sorry God will God wills and the supper's Shield s again foreign God has changed our minds they can't get in foreign Hey Brother yo how about turning the uh internet off please if you don't mind tell me when it shut off okay rosewood's got something
