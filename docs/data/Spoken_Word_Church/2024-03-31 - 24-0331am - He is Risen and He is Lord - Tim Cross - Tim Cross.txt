really caught my attention it said love will be my weapon what a weapon Lord you know the more you grow in God and just through uh my own experience you see love is just it's not an emotion it's a person it's the very quickening power of the Holy Ghost it's what raised up Jesus from the dead it's who he is it's who you are in in in Christ is what's going to raise our bodies and change us is his love it's everything that you see every scripture you read every trial you go through every up and down Mountain and Valley is him is his love amen we're thankful for that thank you for this song Amen uh let's sing this one song um I had it on my list and sister alrey uh she text in and said Brother Joseph can you sing this song I've got so much to thank him for how many of us this morning can

Messiah and then he crucified and then he rose that gratitude that thankfulness just kept on getting greater and then you receive the holy ghost in the upper room what a power what a Thanksgiving and

and complaining the Pharisees were having a a party but Sunday wasn't Sunday hadn't come yet Sunday's here now there's a proof and the proof is standing right here yes sir proof of the Resurrection is right here it's inside out of you a resurrection like no other Resurrection brother Ram said what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is right here today what a resurrection this is Jesus Christ is alive because I see him in your [Applause] smile what he's done for us it's going to take an eternity to thank him for everything he's done right so I thank God he give us an eternity to thank him brother Josh for everything he's done for us everything every little thing he's done for us we don't know how much he's done for us really until we really get there and he'll say you remember that day this happened I had an angel come and help you with that you remember what happened over here you almost had a wreck well I had an angel come and help you with that cuz I needed you to stay on the earth cuz I needed you to what fulfill your purpose your purpose in his plan amen you are part of the plan of God you love the Lord let's give him another hand clap of Praise um before we get started brother Boyd has a um has a testimony that happened on Easter between him and my dad so if you'll be seated just a minute then we'll continue on brother boy sorry for uh being out of order here maybe but I want tell you something about my Jesus 17 years ago today I was leading music right here CU service was nearing an end I raised my hand and a spear come through my back with the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life it was Easter Sunday and we I could barely get through the end of the service and brother uh Dale went with me to the emergency room and we stayed in there about six hours and they couldn't decide what had happened they said well we don't know what it is we can't tell you what it is we don't know we don't think it's cancer we just don't know so they put me in the hospital brother Bob three days later my doctor comes bouncing in a room he says we figured it out it's osteitis and what what osteitis is is the bone in T10 vertebrae my back the bone had died and was dying out and it required me to uh start a treatment of 2500 M bag of vanomas and I had to take it every day every morning before I went to work I'd work all day and go home and cry myself to sleep cuz the pain level was so great and I just think my Jesus Christ endure that pain amen right but here's my point we went through treatments I'd get up at 5:30 in the morning go to for went to work and set an hour in O what is it the oology where Cancer Care was and I got to meet a whole lot of people that had cancer and I'd sat there and take my treatments brother dick he would come there on days in the morning bring his guitar we would sing and praise and testify of the Lord the Lorden and I was uh leading music that Sunday morning because brother de he was in St Joe where he often traveled but you know as I went through that treatment and brother Dale he stood with me he'd come and be at the hospital with me and he never was a man of a lot of words but when he said yep or he he'd say m that's right you knew you knew he was right yeah but through that my faith you won't find anybody that's got greater Faith than I I've worked never missed a day of work I supposed to have 45 days of treatment I'll be quick here in just one second about 20 days in the the treatment they drew blood cuz they had to check my blood every three or four I don't know after three or four treatments they drew blood out checking the level vomi and which was the strongest antibiotic you could take and one one day they drew blood out and The Vow was about that much red blood and the rest was triglycerides is what they told me so I had talked to brother Dale really concerned cuz it ran through my family heart trouble and stuff and uh so I come to church it was a Wednesday night got prayed for my next time I was supposed to draw blood was uh on a Thursday so the came up here and got prayed for and testified what had happened and then next day I go back to have my blood drawn and they said uh I told her before she drew a car little was her name I said now when you draw that blood this time there's not going to be anything in there praise the Lord there was nothing nothing there but here's my point my faith I I've worked all through this and I only ended up having to go through those treatments about 20 something days because of God I would go home and I'd go to work and come home and I'd literally cry out to God to take me because the pain was so great I actually had raised my threshold a pain so high that I felt good one day and went out in the pasture with five horses and fell to my knees because my legs paralyzed and I dropped to the ground and the doctor said that I had raised my pain level so high that my muscles just shut down so can't you imagine your lord Jesus Christ on that cross that's right brother being pierced with but that pain that I had in my back was not just a poke it was like a continuous run through and it just lays on my heart that that's what the Lord Jesus Christ took for me and he's still doing the healing Lord this whole body of mine if I get to 3 score1 in December that's all I deserve I don't deserve but I know I know my healer liveth and if you don't know Jesus Christ better get aboard cuz we're taking flight amen thank you he's the same yesterday today and forever let's stand to our feet amen [Applause] amen we've had a good weekend we we've come now to the to the last service and we uh appreciate brother Tim and his family coming brother Solomon and his family coming and brother Josh and his family coming they're going to sing here in just a little bit when brother Tim comes out but sure enjoy brother Solomon's Friday you did a good job opening it up for us to to have a real good service and then brother Tim took his Liberty last night or yesterday and thank you all sisters and brothers for the meal that you fix yesterday we sure appreciate that there is plenty left over so after the service today we're going to pray over the food and go downstairs and eat you don't have to go to a restaurant cuz they're going to be full you know that being Easter Sunday so we can stay here and fellowship but I want to ask you one thing let's try to hurry up and eat we can Fellowship outside because Sister Lisa needs to clean the church today and it takes a long time to clean the church um so let's eat kind of in a hurry and if you want a fellowship like I said go sit outside and let her begin to clean the church we just appreciate all of you coming appreciate having enough food left over cuz man it was good yesterday well it's going to be good again today so I I appreciate all the sisters and brothers um putting forth an effort to uh to uh cook us a meal and we sure appreciate that also remember that um today is Easter Sunday so happy Easter this ain't bunnies and this ain't bunnies and chickens no this is the day of Resurrection amen we celebrate it every Sunday but this is a special one this is the time when our savior destroyed death am and now you and I are recipients of that Resurrection he didn't just stay gone he came back and came into a group of people and he's still getting into a group of people amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember next Sunday after the second service we will have a baptismal Service uh sister Harmony is getting baptized and um if anybody else wants to I'm going to warmer up on Saturday so it'll be real nice and warm and and the water will be ready and if you want to be baptized like I said before we we've baptized 25 people last year and just in this congregation some re-baptized and put the state down some were baptized for the first time but we believe in water baptism remember brother Aaron did a real good job there Wednesday night talking about water baptism being essential as part part of your Christian experience it's to show to the Devil he's defeated death burial Resurrection I tell them all the time brother Solomon next Sunday we're going to a killing right there will be a death next Sunday you die out to yourself and as Dwight Moody said God will only fill those who are not full of their self so if we need to empty out as one brother used to say a long time ago he said X me out Lord put the X on me and you come in and you be part of you be my life and we appreciate um all the ministry that's been here today and

that song say he became me that I could become him by Grace amen he became all that we were so we could become everything that he is praise the lord we have so much to be thankful for this morning I'll invite you to uh stand and turn with me in the scriptures um I want to read from two places first in Isaiah chapter 60 and then I I didn't write this down brother when I gave you the notes earlier but also Ephesians chapter 2 um you know I believe the the resurrection Easter means more to us today sir than it has ever meant to Christians of any age in the past amen because we're living in the in the hour of another Resurrection amen and so we are so grateful I I love to sing that song there's never been a day like this day amen because it's it's evening time but yet the the sun is shining again in its strength amen let's um approach the author of the word once more in prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we come to honor the resurrection this morning we pray father that you will come and join with us in this service Lord walk the aisles and move among our hearts Lord Jesus to declare yourself Lord the Risen Savior Lord our atonement our lamb Lord that bled and died and then raised again Lord for our justification Lord may it take on a newer and greater meaning to each of us today and Lord may your resurrected life come and Quicken us father God and make us and mold us Lord more into your image we ask you to Grant it Lord and we just pray that you will have the preeminence and Lord you will receive glory to yourself for all that is done Lord in this service today Father God May Our Lives be changed father God and we just ask you father to break the bread of life to our hearts now and we thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen Isaiah chapter 60 verse1 arise amen and Shine for thy light is com amen and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising amen let's also turn into the New Testament to Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians 2 I'm sure these are all familiar scripture readings to us but you know the Lord has a way of just quickening these uh portions of his word in in a in a special season amen and and bringing a manifestation from that hallelujah amen Ephesians 2 verse one and you hath he quickened amen there was nothing that could Quicken you but him and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and uh and the of the mind and were by Nature the children of of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he hath loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated this morning amen I want to take for a title this morning he is risen and he is Lord amen now we we believe he has risen and all of Christianity believes he is risen but what is our relationship to him this morning amen he is Lord he's my savior he's my Lord he's my king he's my Redemption he's my salvation amen you know God doesn't just give these things he is these things to the believer and to the Overcomer amen and so we have you know it's just like I said Mary was there and when she came to the tomb she said what have you done with my Lord he's still my Lord I don't care what the world thinks about him I don't care what the rumors are that are swirling I don't care what the Romans are saying or any of the others he's my Lord and if I can just get in his presence again amen and so there there was a relationship that was revealed there now the prophet of God preaches a message in January 12th of 1964 called Shalom and you know the longer we go in time the more we realize how accurate this message is as a prophecy sir amen and what might have seemed true then seems even more true today amen and so he says here in verse in paragraph 41 he says we're facing here and our two subjects that we read the two scriptures rather a contrast one to the other in Isaiah it says arise and shine for the glory of God has come upon you the light is here and then the very next verse says gross darkness is upon this people and then we are in when we are in a mixture that's Kentucky language for you right there we're in a mixery of light and darkness and then my address to the church is Shalom peace let's find out what it's all about see we are facing this year in both Darkness and Light and the world is in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that it's ever stood in and yet it's standing in again the Most Blessed light that it ever did Shine in the difference is just like it was in the beginning when there was gross Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and said let there be light and God separated the light from the darkness and I believe that we are now living in that hour again that when God is separating light from darkness and he's pressing it to the other side of the the world that the light might be manifest amen and you know the thing about it is when when a message comes forth when a prophecy Goes Forth when a light shines amen it shines to produce something it right amen a prophecy Goes Forth to produce an effect amen when when when uh you remember when Elijah became discouraged amen he was there in the mouth of the cave and God said I'm going to show you there's 7,000 that's been reserved that have not bowed the knee to Bell God sent the message for somebody God sent the prophet for somebody amen there was a prophecy that went forth that was going to have an effect when God said let there be light he wasn't speaking to another planet he wasn't speaking to another galaxy he was speaking to the Earth because he had formed the Earth with potentials that lay down on the inside of it and regardless what it looked like to an onlooker or an outsider God knew something was invested there and brother he was speaking to the elements he was speaking to the conditions he was speaking to the environment and the atmosphere because he knew when he spoke it would have an effect amen and it would separate the darkness from the light and it would bring something into manifestation that before had been a mystery amen when Christ was hanging there on Calvary Satan thought he had a great Victory but what he was but what he was doing was making it possible for a mystery to be revealed the mysterious part of Christ was Miss Jesus Christ waiting to be released and expressed through the next seven ages and now we're living at the climax of that we are living in that time and so the prophet says we're caught between these two Realms and we are giving witness or we are reflecting this morning one or the other you know I was thinking when brother Brandon preached the message Souls that are in prison now he talked about being a child and and having been shot and he was dying there laying in a pool of his own blood and he went and visited the regions of the lost and then later amen I believe it was in 1961 then he was taken up and saw his con s he saw another realm another dimension amen but but he said uh and he said I in one place he said I believe God has let me see both places and one of them he said whatever you do don't go there and the other one he said whatever you do don't miss it amen but here he seen now the regions of the Lost there is a child amen a young a young boy there and and and that was probably in the early 1900s maybe the 1910s or the 1920s I'm not sure exactly but here it is some 40 50 years later he and his wife are in a JC Penny and she's shopping and he's sitting there on the bench and up the escalator comes these women with their faces painted and making these noises exactly like he saw in Vision amen when he was a child there in the Realms of the lost so Hell hath enlarged itself the realm of the lost the regions of the Lost amen are having such an influence now amen that it's manifesting itself or it's expressing itself here on the earth and the prophet of God is seeing that he's giving witness to that he's said it's not coming it's not off in the future we're living right now amen the desires of Satan amen the ambition of Satan has been realized in his subjects here on the Earth but at the same time time there's another desire there's another Power there's another reality that is striking the Sons and Daughters of God the message has come to give light Hallelujah the call of the bridegroom has come to call a bride to Perfection hallelujah amen and so there's uh brother Solomon preached on Friday night I believe he titled the influence fluence of the Resurrection I spoke last night or yesterday afternoon on the witnesses of the Resurrection I want to call this this morning the impact of the Resurrection amen you know the natural sunrise in the springtime or the Easter season is the same Sun that rises every other day of the year it's not a different ball of fire up in the sky it's the same sun and it's the same light but now it is rising in a certain season and the angle or the relationship between the Sun and the Earth is such that that light shining on the surface of the Earth now begins to produce a different effect amen it begins to produce a different result than it did only months or weeks before because there's something lying beneath the surface of that earth that is quickened by the sunlight I believe they call it photosynthesis it's a response to light that brings forth life hidden life dormant life life that is every much every bit there amen and is as much there amen as it was any other time of the year but it's being called for it's being beckoned it's being drawn by the power of the light of the sun am and it's producing a a different result a different effect amen the sunrise in this season is bringing a special effect or is producing a unique result it's calling that life forth from the earth it is revealing the hidden potentials amen I I I believe that seed if we could think of it in this way that seed is lying there waiting for that sun to strike it it's yearning for that it's Desiring that it's Desiring that warmth it's Desiring those rays and you know we we put on sunscreen and we put on hats and we put on all these things to protect ourselves from that light because it has a different effect on our skin but to the seed oh my it's Desiring that light other things amen May shy away from it but the seed says I want more of that because it's bringing the results that are down on the inside that could never be produced any other way amen now the prophet of God says this now God promised that he would bring his bride out what he would do there would be a seed and there would be a light in the evening time how he would do all these things just exactly and by the way that he originally planned it in the Old Testament and the New Testament and it wasn't through denomination it wasn't through our system we're using today we're causing death we're just causing death let people put their hands in it and die from it remember this was um this was the message trying to do God a service without it being his will when David had a desire to restore the word of the Lord to its rightful place but he went about it without consulting the channel the prophet God has channels that he operates through and if you avoid that if you disregard that it brings death so he had a right desire amen but he didn't have the timing and he didn't have God's blessing there wasn't God's appointed time and God's appointed way so a man died as a result of that and brother bam said people are dying because we're trying to bring it through our system and men are putting their hands in it and it's causing death but then he says the word the evening message oh my must carry evening results the evening message must sow evening seed not morning seed evening seed is that right the midday seene its seeds back there was denomination it died and perished but evening time message will produce evening time light we'll show evening times results the evening time message in Jesus time it was a midday message showed midday results the beginning message showed the beginning results made creation he made his son in his own image in the midday in the evening time he makes a bride for it oh brother amen I I get excited and I lose my place but he makes a bride for it oh and you've heard me say this before but when that when God formed Adam in in Eden he uh his mystery was still locked up inside him misses Adam and then God removed that part of Adam that feminist part and her name was Adam too and then he brought her to him now I don't know how many creatures she passed on her way through the garden to meet the one she came from but none of them could reveal to her where she began or where she belonged but him amenallah and that I believe that represents the Journey of the Believer from our natural birth here in this earth until we are restored back and we are placed back within Christ amen and only he can reveal to us who we truly are and why we were truly formed and what our place in purpose is here on this Earth and is to express him Adam could not have a family without her amen he had power he had created Power he was a God here on the Earth but he could have no expression he could have no extension of himself without her so God needs you God needs a bride God needs his body to manifest his life through amen oh my so he makes a bride for it what by his word he made her the same way he made him oh my I like this too I just throw this nugget in there he made Adam Out of the Dust of the Earth but he didn't make Eve out of dust he made Eve out of Adam amen he reached into the Earth and pulled out 16 elements and breathed the spirit of life into it and that made Adam but when he made Eve he didn't reach into the Earth he didn't reach into creation he reached into the the first Adam he reached into him and pulled out a part of him and made that into her Hallelujah so it shows you you don't come from a Fallen Earth you don't come from your the natural relationship between your parents you come from God as an expression of his very life amen hallelujah brother Bram said I was born again when I realized I was not the son of Charles and El Bram praise the lord it's it's deep but it's powerful how did he form the Earth how did he speak it into existence by his word who was his son the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among how will he take his bride by his word not by a new cart not by some Theologian idea but according to his word he'll identify her don't put one thing to it or take one thing away from it now leave it the way it is the evening time he promised he would reveal through open these Seven Seals and show what them churches had missed back there Revelation 10 Malachi 4 St Luke 17:30 he said he would do it now let's not mix it up let's keep it right like thatl amen you know Harvest Time Harvest time comes and and if you think of it in the fall season and most Harvest especially here in North America most things we Harvest toward the end of the summer or the fall so it it is it is harvested right as the cold weather is approaching amen right as the days are beginning to get shorter and and and and the fall time is coming or the or the season of death or the season of life going back into the roots that's when the Harvest time comes that's when the fruit reaches full maturity that's when a manifold expression of the original seed comes back into view ready to produce the same results that the original did is at the evening time is at the harvest season amen so the Harvest time comes at the end of the season right before the coldness sets in right as Darkness begins pressing coldness begins creeping in oh my but in that time amen the farmer is going out there and he's inspecting the wheat he's inspecting the fruit amen he just any day now I'm going to take it back to the Garner I'm going to gather it all up and we realize the tears have all already been gathered the tears have already been bundled into the World Council of churches they've been gathered by denominationalism they have had their revivals the Lutheran the wesling the methodists the Pentecostals they've all had their Revival to gather them back to where they originated from but there's a reev Revival promis for the bride a word Revival which is going to gather Us Together by the revealed word of the hour back to the original amen back to what we came from amen darkness is pressing coldness is creeping in but the wheed is being Reed now brother and sister we can feel we can see the darkness pressing amen just read a newspaper just look around us in a nation that was built on Christian principles far from it today we can feel it you could you you you don't even have to necessarily even go out but if you should dare amen what brother brandom experienced in JC Pennies is an everyday occurrence now Hell hath enlarged itself amen they're they're they're painted up they're tattooed up amen they're they're drugged up uh they they they don't put in institutions anymore they medicate them and send them home they put them out on the streets because they don't have institutions to contain them all insanity is on the rise all of these things and so you can feel a great spiritual tension you can feel the pressure amen our young people deal with it people that are sensitive they feel it amen and it's causing a great Warfare and it's a great struggle amen but the darkness is the darkest right before the dawn right amen amen but we can feel these this pressure of the Demonic forces Waring and the world is being gathered for the battle of Armageddon brother bam said rock and roll music is preparing the minds of the people for the battle of Armageddon you know and some of what is called classic rock and roll is pretty tame to some of this music that's coming out now I don't know if it's because I'm getting older or just I don't know but you know nowadays you you we walk into a grocery store you're just pumping gas at a gas station and here it could be country music it could be Rock I don't even know what what to call the music anymore don't even sound like music but the lyrics and the words that are coming out thought my goodness it's so graphic it's so vile I mean it's so it's so lwd there's no filter anymore there's there's nothing held back there there there there it doesn't there there's no rating there's no way Amen to protect amen we're being bombarded by it every day of our lives in this in what used to be a Christian Nation you can't deny it amen and Satan is expressing himself amen the the the very lid has been ripped off the kettle brother said hell but the bride is responding to a risen son that light is calling for response amen when Jesus raised from the dead on that third and glorious Easter morning he did not rise alone there was more than one empty grave there were hundreds if not thousands of them amen because the Bible says the graves were open and many of the saints that slept were raised with him glory we talked about the Hebrew children last night when he appeared in the fiery furnace he appeared to vindicate their testimony they didn't stand for wormwood they didn't stand for Michael they stood for him and when he when they walked into that fiery furnace he appeared in there with them to vindicate their witness to stand there amen these boys have stood here for me and so when he rose on that third and glorious Easter morning amen he did not rise alone but Abraham raised with him I believe Adam raised with him I believe Isaiah raised with him I believe job raised with him I believe David raised with him I believe all of those Saints amen they were his Old Testament Church they were his Old Testament bride friend listen listen when Satan interjected in the Garden of Eden the serpent seed he did not derail God's plan to have a family God was still going to have a family God was still going to have attributes expressed in the Earth and through revelation God was going to Quicken them amen and even job said though the skin worms destroy my flesh yet in my flesh I shall see him my eyes Shall Behold Him and not another now I'm just preaching I'm off my notes but you remember something last night faith is proven when it seems that he is distant when it seems that he has withdrawn or when it seems that he is absent that's when faith is proven that's when faithfulness amen is put to the TK good to see you brother God bless you amen so here I I just want to say this on Saturday when the Earth was quiet cold and dark and all the disciples had gone back to their former way of life and everybody else was weeping and mourning there was something going on in another realm unseen to this realm here on the earth Jesus was doing the work of redemption and he was going to hell visiting the souls that were there in prison and he was condemning those who had rejected the message of their hour he didn't save anybody who rejected Noah's message but he could find them there permanently and eternally to be lost for rejecting his witness in his day he didn't save any lost but he redeemed he restored there was a knock on the door and that's when Ezekiel said that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel see they all saw him in a different form or expression but it was him and he said Satan I'm here to take mine amen out of paradise back to Earth and then we're going to take it's a prefigure of the Rapture amen so brother and sister it may not look like a whole lot's going on right now but there is a whole lot going on a PR is being perfected faith is being proven amen Enoch is Walking with God every day amen tuned to the word listening to the word responding to the word and the word Revival is going on in the heart of the Bride right now amen I believe that amen that risen son he brought his body he brought those Old Testament Saints with him his resurrection Vindicated his body yeah not just one not just the the the son of Joseph and Mary not just the body that was formed in the womb of Mary but his spiritual body his believer they were connected with him and when he raised they rose with him he Vindicated their faith by bringing them he led captivity captive amen I don't have the scriptures but it's the truth they were you know as children they play Follow the Leader yeah they follow their leader the one that led him in the form of the pillar of fire the one that led him through Egypt or from Egypt to the Canaan land amen he rose and they followed him praise the Lord and so he we know that brother Brandon preached the message it is the rising of the Sun and he brought out Christ as being the Fulfillment of that wav sheath amen I love that brother you know because some people have the uh the idol idea that when God does something he just does it to make one person one figure or one character the centerpiece or the focal point and everybody else just looks at that and admires that my on praise God for what he did in brother SE and so but God don't do it for that reason Jesus said because I live you shall live also he said the works that I do shall you do also he wasn't raising amen just to vindicate himself but he was going to have a Vindicated Ministry in redeemed Sons and Daughters of God that he would leave here on the earth oh glory to God hallelujah amen I will not leave you comfortless if I go away I will return and receive you to myself that where I am there you may be also let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me I go to prepare you a place I go to make possible Hallelujah the return of my spirit into you as a church amen that I can have the preeminence here on Earth and redeem people I just I just got to say it amen when he appeared to to to when he appeared to Simon he said who are you Lord when he appeared to to to Peter or excuse me to Paul Simon Saul there you go I knew it started with an S when he appeared to Saul he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest Saul had never met Jesus Christ in a physical form but he had met him in Bride for and he was persecuting that church will we sing that song I'm in this church it's a glorious church that's what he was telling Saul I'm in that church they're a glorious Church they didn't join they were born they had a new birth and he said when you're persecuting them you're persecuting me because that is his body here upon the Earth living moving and dwelling and his Spirit had come into them to Quicken those potentials Hallelujah the light of the word the light of Jesus ministry amen had shown upon them to Quicken them to express the same life by this shall all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another praise the Lord so I'm going back to that wave sheath and we know what the wave sheath was when you had a field of wheat or barley or whatever it was I guess wheat would be the best type they would go and pluck up the first one that came to maturity and bring it to the high priest and he would wait as a wave offering before the Lord to be accepted and when it was accepted brother Louise Not only was it accepted but the entire crop the entire field was accepted before the Lord because you know he he didn't have to go gather the whole field at that time he just gathered the one yes but it testified there's more just like me there's more of the same genetics there's more with the same DNA there's more with the same potentials and when that one is accepted and waved amen when it's waved and accepted and God testifies of its acceptance he's not just accepting that one he's accepting all of the others amen who have seen that sheep wave before them and it also gives them hope it also gives them faith it is the rising of the sun if I be lifted up now we're seeing the revealing of the son of man it wasn't a man it wasn't Willam Bram it wasn't a child with a seventh grade education it was the ministry of the son of man it was Christ amen who had raised risen in a Ministry to be waved before God and accepted amen am I going too fast when he went beyond the curtain of time he said are these Broms he said no too many of them these are your converts that were won to Christ by your ministry and Paul's following Paul's followers will be judged by the message that he preached and they accepted and yours will too and they said if you are accepted and you will and you will it was a foregone conclusion friend this ain't a fair fight we are decided winners we've been made conquerors through him that loved us amen but but but you're giving witness that you have the same life done inside of you when you say Amen to the waved sheath or the waved word it's too hot for some but for the seed they're longing for that because that sun is bringing that wheat to maturity to Perfection and it's caus it's making the shuck pull away it's making all the unbelief pull away because he's only interested in one thing and that's the Perfection of what was originally placed in the ground and when that is displayed it's taken brother it's taken in the Harvest there was uh the wave sheath gave test to that let me let me read a few more things to you is this all right Amen Let me see if I'm yes the wave sheath as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ out coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and for the first time that will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there is there any difference between the ministry that we received and the original Ministry of Christ 2,000 years ago no there's not one bitter difference if anything it's greater amen these signs shall you do and greater it's been a greater and it doesn't take anything away from the original it's the Fulfillment it's a proof you are the proof remember the coin last night there's a Dye amen there's an element there's a material but there's many that are stamped out and they're placed into circulation and they have the same worth they have the same value they have the same substance that the original had Jesus said because I live you shall live also you are going to be the remaining proof in the earth that he lives nobody has to go to Israel nobody has to see an empty tube they can see you the Life of Christ Liv through you and it has a compelling effect if I be lifted up I'll draw a men you're not going to win people with your knowledge you're not going to win people amen with your legalism but the Life of Christ will draw them draw them to him Lord let it let it radiate through me through you amen same signs and wonders because I live ye shall live also speaking to his wife what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest you see brother bam said Pentecost was another waving amen you know you don't Harvest all your field in one day typically you harvest them as they mature and you'll have sections of that field that will mature first because of the way the sunlight because of the irrigation the rain all these various factors affect the Readiness of the field amen so he was raised as first fruits we'll get to it here in just a minute but on the day of Pentacost here was 120 they come out of the upper room waving again yeah and Peter was waved oh my and Peter was waved in the world said uhoh fanaticism let's pull up his track record this is the one that denied him this is the one that cursed this is the one that swore this was the one that is the moment any pressure was applied he was off he was gone he he fled he departed and this same Peter is staggering out the upper room like a drunk man let's see what he's got to say huh the world is taking a critical view to the furtherance of the Gospel the world is taking a critical view to the life of the sheath now being lived in other Wheats other other manifestations in the world said what mean this and Peter said I'm sorry let me let me let me go back up here into the upper room and draft an apology and a recusal let no he wasn't backtracking because this wasn't Peter this was the same life this was the same life that had been in Jesus Christ was now living through Peter and speaking through Peter and he said these men aren't drunk as you suppose now y'all heard me say this before he didn't deny they were drunk no he didn't he just said they ain't drunk the way you think they are they were absolutely drunk it was a stimulation of fornica stimulation to Revelation not natural wine not natural stimulation but it was a stimulation of spiritual spiritual quickening of the word amen and so what did Peter do he said this is that he leap frogged over Jesus and went all the way back to Isaiah with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people this is that he brought a prophecy off the page and said I am living the message of the prophet now what's going on in the bride's Revival she's not just quoting quotes she's not just playing tapes but the literal expression of what was on those pages has come forth in a bride manifestation hallelujah hallelujah this is that and what 3,000 Souls were added to the church that day just that waving of 120 brought a manifold effect to produce the same life amen oh I love this Satan tried to stomp it out he is he's almost as determined as he is dumb and he thinks you can stamp it out you can stomp it out you can apply persecution and tribulation but it's just like a dandelion any of y'all ever seen a dandelion you know a dandelion is a weed if you want a blue ribbon Southern Homes and live living lawn you don't fill it up with Dandy lines and daffodils you want nice green grass right a dandelion is a weed so here you are going along in your mower there's a dandelion I'm gonna get rid of that thing and you mow over top of it and you didn't kill anything you just made about a thousand Dandy lions and you dispersed him and that's exactly what Satan did the moment he tried to stomp us out stamp us out or shut us up he just spreads us a little further the influence just goes a little further amen amen Oh my he was that waved sheath I think I'll just uh jump over here now to Acts chapter one praise the Lord I'm like a real estate agent I am closing it may be 45 60 or 90 days but I am closing but I pray when we're done we're in a new house amen praise the Lord praise the Lord Acts chapter one we find it here praise the Lord all right you shall receive power now they had power but he's talking about another Power they had an anointing that had come to them by the spoken word but Judas had the same anointing but Judas wasn't here for this address he had already manifested what he was and was dead and gone but you shall receive power I mean acts 1 chapter verse 8 you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me amen both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and in the uttermost unto the uttermost part of the earth and while he had spoken these things while th while they beheld that body that they love and adored and slept with and fished with and oh they were so attached he was taken up and the cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel I wonder if it wasn't the same two that met Mary in the Tomb I don't know right but you know they'll always point you to where Christ isely you remember that they were there there there's a nugget those angels said he was here but he's not here anymore and here's these two angels saying he was here and you just seen him disappear but they're going to point them to where he is am those two angels stood by the white perel and also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven now a very similar Jesus will return one almost like him we'll call him the third person of the godhead he'll be so close no what did the angel say this same Jesus well if he's the same then there can be no difference he's the same in his power he's the same in his ability he's the same in his righteousness he's the same in his love his character his nature everything is the same this same Jesus amen this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven then returned they unto Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey and when they were come in they went into an upper room where both Peter James John Andrew Philip all those remaining 11 disciples and Peter rallied them and they chose a 12th disciple but that was their choice before the Holy Ghost came they made an appointment to a disciple but when the Holy Ghost came he chose Paul he chose Saul amen but what we're we're we're watching the the stage being set for what the sheath pointed to what the wave sheath testified was possible Right was fixing to manifest over here just a chapter later amen and when the day of Pentecost was fully come Acts 2 verse1 when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting brother it didn't just feel the house it filled the occupants minutes later the house would be empty but those who were there would not be they would be full Hallelujah brother here in just a little while this building is going to be empty but you're not going to be empty you're going to be going forth and this word that you have received Into Your Heart by faith is going to be living and expressing itself in the darkness in the oia in this chaos in this Blackness Oh Glory to God Arise Shine for thy light is come this kind of light Manifest this kind of seed Hallelujah and that's why you couldn't stay in the barnyard you couldn't stay in the denominations you couldn't even stay in a message denomination something called you out amen praise the Lord got to find a place to close here Pentecost was the return of Christ in a form the Holy Ghost That Could Quicken his remaining body his attributes to express his life in the redeemed attrib the impact of his resurrection the proof was a many membered bride body that would remain here on the earth expressing his resurrected life amen let me find this this quote here not going to be as long as I was yesterday so there has got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride believe brother Solomon testified of it when when brother Ram saw the preview of the Bride he saw the bride coming to preview and then he saw the leot toan church dancing and twisting the rock and roll looking to her leader a witch brother Bram said is this what my Ministry has produced is this what the waved sheath is this the echo is this the answer to that and the the voice said the the bride will come into preview again and that Omega bride was the alpha bride but that Omega bride was you it wasn't the Ephesian age it wasn't an infant bride it was the bride that the ministry of the revealed word the prophet's message Malachi 4 It produced amen it's what that produced I uh just before I continue reading that I had this scripture over in Revelation chapter 1 I John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ amen the witness of the Resurrection is not always liked appreciated embraced or received it is persecuted yes amen but you know what have you ever squeezed an orange did you ever get anything out of it beside orange juice The Squeeze only produces the life that's on the inside amen so persecution tribulation amen adversity only reveals what's already on the inside I was in the alip patmas for the testimony of Jesus Christ the the word of God I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard a voice behind me as a great voice as a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us right in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus samna pergamus tarus sardus Philadelphia and under Le oia and I'm I'm skipping down and when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not I am the first and the last be and be I I am I am he that liveth and was dead the same Jesus not a different one Jesus now in his glorified deity the deification of Christ revealing him as the one true God and it's now going to reveal him in seven churches in Seven Ages that are going to be called by seven Messengers which are his stars in his right hand the light of the word going forth age after age after age after age to bring the seed of that age Amen to bring the elect predestinated Sons and Daughters of God to their position oh my I'm he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell end of death is there anything he hasn't conquered is there anything beyond his ability is there any sickness is there any sin oh he's greater he's greater and he's your Redeemer he's not only risen but he is [Music] Lord he's not only risen but he is Lord amen and he took Mary to The Upper Room the same Mary that stood at the foot of the cross the same Mary that came to the tomb that morning he took her to the upper room and he birthed himself forth from inside of her and she helped John write the Book of Revelation you know what you're writing the message now absolutely brother you are the message you are the living Epistles of this message you are writing the final chapter of the book of Acts in [Music] 2024 he is risen and he is Lord there has got to come one there has got to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs Mary's talking about that Cadillac and both are identical except one has uh one has the spark one has real gasoline in it what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job where there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has got to be a Dynamics to make it work that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what e approved he wasn't only the word he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shake into life and arise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead Till The Sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that and he's alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it and if as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all of the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride Jesus Vindicated job's witness when he rose job raised with him he Vindicated Noah's winess witness he Vindicated David's witness and the bride is vindicating the message of all previous ages amen and one day the sleeping Saints are going to rise forth to say Amen I'm saying this by inspiration you correct it if it's wrong the the the sleeping Saints is going to rise to say Amen to the resurrection message being preached by the bride she is the final mouthpiece under her Prophet messenger the same voice that called Lazarus from the grave the shout has gone forth brother who's saying it now old brother Tim that's your job as a preacher that's brother Wade's job hey who's going to live it who's going to Echo it amen you're saying something with your life you're saying something with your testimony you're giving witness to the resurrection and one day it's going to become so HED to Perfection as the Capstone and the pyramid are becoming one it's going going to raise all those Saints from the previous ages from the grave for a 30 to 40 day reunification right before he reappears in the sky oh there's going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet bind by I'm going to meet you meet you over there he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the the bride can only manifest if it does something different from the groom isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him and as as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife amen the spirit of him and the Flesh of him had put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics oh yes absolutely praise the Lord I'm going to close you can believe it this time the message you know I don't know that when Luther raised I don't know that when he was born I don't know that when he was felt a call in his life to minister to go to a seminary or whatever studies he did I don't know that Luther was was conscious of the fact he would lead the Protestant Reformation with a little tiny tidbit of light that's shown upon the scripture to say the just shall live by faith but that was quickened to him brother it was so quickened that he began to burn there you talk about internal combustion there was something going on the inside of Luther we don't have have to do penet we don't have to pray to a holy man we don't have to crawl across Nails in broken glass there is one mediator between God and man and that is the man Christ Jesus I want to say this this morning it didn't just produce a doctrine of justification It produced Justified lives sanctification came along and it didn't just produce a theology it didn't just produce books and tapes or or shelves lying with the writings of Wesley It produced a Sanctified life and when the gifts were poured out on the day of Pentecost God was restoring his church per Joel's prophecy Hallelujah all the years that the Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar and the Palmer worm I will restore amen it didn't just produce the theology I going tell you something this message did not take the gifts out of the church it it so emphasized the importance of the gifts that it put them in the proper order under the word amen anything that comes from God won't shy away from the uran Thum the uran thumb will vindicate that's a true gift from godl amen you remember they said oh uh Martin we got this holy man he's got all these great manifestations and and they said let come let

the sun is striking the wheat now at such an angle it's bringing it into the very expression oh oh my that wasn't the life of William bradam that was the Life of Christ being lived through William bradam showing what it was going to producing the bride and that is the impact of the Resurrection a witness amen as as the musicians come forth as the musicians come this morning can you imagine Mary leaving that tomb after having seen the Lord Jesus no doubt her face was glowing with the same Radiance that was on Moses when he came down off the mountain her face was shining with the glory of the resurrected Christ and brother she went went back to Peter she went back to those disciples he's risen he's risen from the dead my Lord My Savior My Redeemer he's risen can you imagine them oh Mary you just hadn't got enough sleep yeah you just you know oh no there was no denying it it was irrefutable it was undeniable nothing could stop her nothing could silence her witness nothing could dampen her spirits amen nothing could subdue her she had come in contact with the resurrected Christ and it gave her a message he's not dead he's alive he's alive My Redeemer he lives my healing my salvation my Deliverance My All In All oh my and Friends he lives today yes he's alive and you are the proof you are the proof of this message you are the witness that he's a resurrected life oh my may it live in me May it live in the church may it live in The Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour amen we've been impacted by the resurrection would you like to stand this morning oh my I wonder if we could sing

day to me there has never been a day like this day I see oh there's never been a life that shines so bright as this day this glor amen amen you know I was thinking about this when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed it was signed into law but it took effect it took effect at the rising of the Sun that's right that Sunrise meant something to those slaves it might have been any other day to any other person but to a person who is the benefactor of that Emancipation Proclamation that Sunrise meant I'm not a slave anymore I'm not second class anymore I am everything my Creator purposed and ordained for me to be at the rising of the Sun this sunrise May mean nothing to a denomination May mean nothing to Baptists May mean nothing to others still in bondage but to the bride this Sunrise is the Emancipation Proclamation ye who are dead in sins hath he Quicken for been a light that shines so bright as this this Glory glor see if you can sing this little verse with me for Christ is revealing himself unto me he has open my eyes and now I can see oh his word has become a a reality in this day come brother Wade this glorious day let's sing it now with all our hearts oh there's never a day like this day me there has never been a day like this day [Music] I there has never been a li that shine so right as glor amen let's give our brother a good hand let's give the Lord a good hand you know the Bible the those two men were standing there and they said you know that same Jesus that you saw is going to come back in like manner yes I believe he did yes sir the son of man is on the Earth again in his bride the son of man Revelation is what we live under right yes sir the full opening of the word of God and we saw him when a prophet took a picture and turned it around yes sir that the Lord said look at it like this and it showed the deity of Jesus Christ looking down on a bride but you know what that's just a picture you're the image you're the living breathing image of God you are what that produced you are a recipient of the Resurrection amen hold on to that you're going to have trials you're going to have troubles you're going to have tribulations but remember this is not a cruise ship it's a battleship we're in a war that Old Ship of Zion I was I was laying the other night couldn't go to sleep that Old Ship of Zion it's going to look so bad to the world it's going to have holes in it brother Tim it's going the sail's going to be fell over to one side but there's a group of people on that ship yes sir that's going to dock in that Harbor That Old Ship of Zion's got a purpose it's to take us from this Dimension to that Dimension and it ain't going to be pretty to the world this ain't pretty to the world but to God it's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen in his life right this is the day he's looking for the culmination of the Gentile bride taking us home you think about you think about it he hasn't seen his bride for 2,000 years as far as physically seeing him face to face yes oh my if you were away from your bride for 2,000 years you'd want to see that bride you know what I believe God's a cheerleader God saying come on come on come on bride I'm waiting on you remember brother Brown said what God's waiting on what us we're not waiting on God the world thinks we're waiting on a resurrection no no God's waiting on us to come to a place to bring a resurrection right then those dead Saints are going to come here because death has been destroyed in this Dimension by a group of people called a bride because Jesus Christ destroyed death in this Dimension he walked out of that tomb with a glorified body yes and said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me and he transferred that he imorph that into a bride yes oh you love the Lord what a resurrection what a day what a weekend we've had we appreciate all of you we we love you with the love of the Lord thank you all for coming distances to to be in service with us and uh brother Solomon he's going to he's going to be back with us in September he's going to be doing our uh youth service there third third Saturday in September brother Tim will be back in November uh the last Sunday in November when I'll be gone and uh just like we do every year and uh I think y'all are comfortable with him and he's comfortable with y'all he just he's a good minister of the gospel and our young brother here my mama bragged on you that might not mean something to you but everybody else we know you know brother Bob one time you get that nod from Nanny and it's that's good that you got the seal of approval like you got the stamp bro that's right so you're good but uh we love you we appreciate you we appreciate God getting you a lot quicker than the devil did amen and putting you in the ministry so you can help people amen so we appreciate you God give you strength and keep you strong you get old like me and Tim it takes God to keep us strong and keep us cuz our body just falling apart but love you love you brother and sister amen you know don't ever forget what God we can talk about seals and plagues and vials and Daniel 70 weeks and we can go into all that and that's fine because the book's open we can preach that but don't brother Brown said don't ever forget Calvary don't ever forget the basis of why we're here is that man 2,000 years ago died resurrected and as the song said we were deservant of everything that he got right we deserved every bit of it right we deserved to be humble we deserve we deserve to be uh smitten stricken we deserved every bit of that but he said no I'll take it on me bring it to me H because you know what I'm the mighty conqueror and I can just not conquer for myself right I'm going to give it to a group of people and let them conquer brother Tim if Satan would have left Jesus alone yeah he' just died an old man come on he would have lived his life cuz there was no we know what his purpose was but if Satan would have left him alone but he said no I'm going to kill him so he tells the Pharisees kill him tells the Jews turn him down tells this one hey we want we don't want we want Barabas we don't want him hang him on the cross right but the problem was that was one that's right sir about 50 days later Satan had 121 he had to deal with 120 plus Jesus then he just stayed around another few minutes and there was 3,000 little jesuses he had to deal with he has gone Bonkers cuz like brother T said every time you mash something every time you mash a Christian what happens if he if it's a true Christian right if you get mashed yes sir you just bring out more that's right right how do you really you know a rose you can smell it and it smells really good but you take and crush it take that alabaster box that that Mary had she had to open it yeah those spices though before she opened it were flowers and oil and it had to be squeezed out that's the way me and you are we have to be squeezed before we can show the Lord so if we go through trials and tribulations can we just raise our hand and say thank you God thank you God thank you God we we all we hate we hate we hate it we really don't like it but it's for your Perfection if God's perfect yes sir I said if God's perfect he never makes a wrong move right and if you're a Christian like brother Tim said you were in Christ the part that's in you is the same part that was in him amen so all he's doing is is bringing that part out of your humanity and letting the world see why do y'all act this way why why are you acting this way why why you go to church on Friday why do don't go to church all the time I wish we went s days a week that's the way I see it the girl said one time she said I left the church cuz a preacher preached over 30 minutes oh I was in a I was in a a dentist office and they were working on my teeth and I told the lady I said hang on just a minute I need to say something I ra he raised that thing up I said lady let me tell you something little righteous indignation I said let me tell you something I said the person you're supposed to be worship in hung on a cross for 3 hours right with Nails in his hands side all beat all the pieces brother BR said look like hamburger meat I said you can't sit 30 minutes for somebody to tell you about what that guy did I said you're not even a Christian I think she quit I think she left Dr Amy said she wasn't around anymore so but that's that you need to look at it that way if if if Jesus Christ can hang on three hours on the cross from 3 to 6 he hang that that long on the cross just to save your soul yes you can sit and listen to the gospel being preached and should be happy when we come together like this be happy when we come together and and Worship the Lord now we're going to worship Him by praying over the food and we're going to go downstairs and and like I said have your food and eat it but just be um mindful that sister Lisa needs to clean maybe she's clean up here first but be mindful she needs to clean the church so let's just eat what we need to do and pray for sister Jun my wife she's leaving she's leaving me for another man you know if you cut the tape off after that then we're in trouble we and brother Tim were talking about something that happened but she's going to see her dad for a few days her dad's 90 years old and he needs he needs some care and he fell the other day and and um he needs his daughter there to take care of him and I and I agree so June's going to leave in just a few minutes and head on to South Carolina so just remember her in prayer she'd be back on Tuesday afternoon but just remember uh her dad uh being 90 years old a lot of health issues remember my dad with the health issues that he's
