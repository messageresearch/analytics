the same yesterday today and forever whatever he's done for one he'll do for another Amen god bless you tonight you just never extend let's look into the scripture tonight and y'all pray for me I'm not gonna preach on air-conditioners tonight praise the Lord although I got experience at it it's lady I know she said she told me well to preach on being thankful because I tell you what if you're out in the heat for a while you're thankful for air-conditioning thank the Lord for people they know how to pick some too so amen praise the Lord god bless you tonight so we're gonna look in two places not look in the Book of Luke chapter 10 and then we're gonna go to Matthew chapter 9 and read few scriptures here and before we go to the Lord donut had to write myself a note here so have some praise and I told the brothers Monday night at their at the campsite I got two guys two boys that I've had my Bible for I don't know five or six years I guess and one boys named Sammy and the other one's name is Joseph and both I'm suffers from seizures and Joseph is about 14 years old and he's been taking medicine for about five or six years and they done a test this month and he's clear and they're gonna start winning off his season some of y'all may remember or not his mom was on the way to church someone's Sunday morning and he was eating like a pop-tart or something he's in the backseat he was like eight or nine whatever years it was but he they thought he had Bell's palsy he he got to the point he couldn't blink and he couldn't move his mouth he just went all froze up and they thought he had Bell's palsy or something he just panicked and she did too then she stopped the car and got him out and she prayed for him as soon as she finished praying for him it went away but ever since you know since that time he kept getting worse and worse than having having these spells but I want to thank God that he's free and so I just want to thank the Lord for that and another little boy's name is Sammy and I went to school with his mom and he's autistic and has seizures and he has a dog that they paid $26,000 for to take care of him and the county that they live in to North Carolina raised the money for him well wolf is the little dog's name and he got attacked by some other dogs and got tore up and he went through some trauma and he's not responding to say me like he spokes to and so it's gonna cost you know they say somewhere between thirteen and thirty thousand dollars for another dog and so I just believing that the Lord had touched it touched wolf and he'll be okay but uh I was talking to a lady just this week and her son is having Tommy John surgery his name's Michael he's having surgery on his arm for Tommy John and he suffers from seizures also he's like 15 and I told her about Joseph I said we just had a little boy that just got healed and he's not all seizure and medicine so I'm uh getting a prayer cloth for him and I said we're gonna pray for his arm for a surgery but also he won't have to take it mess anymore get rid of that stuff I taught us just of the devil but we're just gonna continue beat that another another lady her son's name CJ he's the one I got a prayer cloth for it has I can't sir he's 23 years old and they're concerned about him losing his eye I got a prayer cloth for him the other day and they've been giving him eyedrops hoping that'll help and he told his mom the other day that he said I'm starting to see shapes and shadows in that eye which he didn't before so y'all just continue to pray I just thank the Lord for that y'all continue to pray for him there so they're still supposed to go into surgery and take the cancer and everything up but you know Lord's the first first step enough in the right direction so and my sister Janine she wants she wanted me get a prayer cloth first so I'm gonna get one for her and then remember brother Richard Douglas I know other people who work outside brother Richie works in the heat doing metal treatment and all kinds of stuff and he suffering really bad with cramps and he's you know and a lot of people that work outside suffer from that so y'all just remember brother Richie did not also and sister Regina sent a message out for us to remember him in prayer and other people work outside know they suffer from that too so I'll just think the Lord that we have somebody to go to when we have when we have needs and problems and you know some people some people are amazing they go on they prayed to God for him to come on the scene when he does something they're shocked by it you know my kids aren't shocked when I do something for my faith they come to me and say why didn't you do that what they expect it you know what they're not shocked when it takes place well you know our Heavenly Father's the same way though we don't have to be amazing if we believe because that he promised it it'll come to pass amen so tonight as we look in the scripture let's just all bow our heads and pray and just remember these needs in each one our Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for another opportunity to be in your house Lord and this Lord feel your presence and know that you're the all-sufficient one Lord for whatever whedon whatever need we have whatever problem we have though we can just go to you and receive all that we have need of and father we just pray tonight you be with us help me tonight Lord Jesus just to say what you'd have me say and just Lord just help me get out of the way Lord and just bless the people tonight Lord for each need that's represented Lord for the ones that I've mentioned tonight Lord for Little Wolf and and and CJ and Michael and all the ones Lord we just pray and brother reach you we just pray that you just be with them and just make your healing virtue manifesting in each one Lord for each hand that was raised Lord each heart Lord you know the need behind it and we just pray that we just Lord just help our unbelief Lord that we can get out of the way that you can work or if we just cast all our cares upon you Lord you said because you care for us or do we just look to you that you can come on the scene and move or let us not get in your way you know we just commit all things to you tonight we just pray that you bless the word as it goes forth Lord bless the speaker in the here in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Luke chapter 10 and verse 30 it's up there it says and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem Jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a Levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his Beast and brought him to an end and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever they'll spend us more when I come again I will repay the which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed mercy unto him and then then said Jesus unto Him go and do thou likewise he meant and then Matthew chapter 9 verse 17 one scripture here says neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they that put but they put new wine into new bottles and are both preserved amen god bless you tonight you may be seated getting on brother Wade's topic a little bit I've been been enjoying what brother Wade's had to say on the seals and you know this just trying to find the mind of God sometimes it's kind of hard and sometimes when you're tired it just sometimes you don't know if you're if you're coming or going you my brother Dale said when Sunday morning he didn't know if I was still out there working on the air conditioner or not but uh you know he heard the scripture and the thought tonight is being the old and the whine and you know in there in Revelation chapter 6 and way waits read it many times we've all read it but you know it says when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine and brother branham and this is what that's what caught my attention brother Branham says in the church in 1954 this is in the church ages sermon that brother Branham preached he said all represents the Holy Ghost always and he says and we'll get to that marking marking the people Friday night notice he said but this ol represents the holy spirit he said that's why we anoint the sick with all is because it represents the holy spirit and then he goes on and he talks about Revelation chapter 6 and he said but hurting up the old and wine he said wish we was going to take revelations on through for a few weeks and get into that and get into that whoo that ol and windiest see you hurt not my Olin wine don't come near it Amen so you know what struck my attention was brother when brother Branham was speaking of that he didn't say what the olden wine was he said who the Olin wine was identifying this a person and so you know when you know who is the old and the wine when when he but when one comes when brother man preaches in the in the seal when he's preaching in the third seal and even in the fourth seal when when he's talking about who the Olin wine is he said who you know he said you can touch those people because you know he was really was restricting their their lifestyle you know there was controlling everything through the church but he told them he said he said you can he said you can touch their bodies he said but you can't touch their lives he said you can't put that anything upon them he said you can touch oh just like when God told Jobe told Satan he said you can touch job he said but there's a barrier that you can only come to he says you can do all these things he said but you can't touch his life you can do everything you want to do to him and you know that's what he could do he said because he they were anointed in their day to give their life because they were saying they were under there under that in the fourth and the fourth age you know they had that spirit of the ox to be to be sacrificial but you know one of the things is you know we look at that as being a as something that's being taken away you know because it is a beast of burden it is a sacrifice but you know there's one thing about it you know if I have something and you're going to take it away from me and I give it to you then you've not you don't have any victory you're not taking anything for me because I give it to you and you know those people you know he came to take something from him but those people gave it because they knew what the end result was going to be so it wasn't that Satan had any victory or because he was giving it to I mean they gave their lives because they knew what was going to take place that was the anointing for that day is to give their lives who say you know you know they could do those things but you know there was victory and what they were to do and who was the old in wine and you know the the parable that Jesus tells about the Samaritan you know here's a here's a man that that's fallen on hard times and was you know beaten and a half dead and you know here's a here's a man that the people that should have been the ones that should have been helping him are the ones that didn't help him you know they said here comes a certain priest along and you know the priest turned to the other side and didn't have any it didn't have any need for him or you know compassion for him just walk don't past him and left him in the ditch to die and then the Levite who should have known the law that if it was his brother according to the Old Testament law he should have helped him they didn't you know he just turn around and walked off also but you know one the one that was a low caste person a Samaritan who many people don't have you know they didn't have a lot to do with and didn't care too much for but you know he was the one that had compassion on this one man to take him in and treating and you know brother branham's talking about we're talking about in the scripture we talks about that he took him to a knee and he said that was the church you know how we're supposed to be that that help because you know brother Adam said that God's only hands are our hands he said I his mouth his feet anything about him is going to be you and I so when it come to being been the manifestation of Jesus Christ is you and I it's not somebody else you know brother Brenham said in he said one time he said he said the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit so if we if we are who that is one because there's not any other manifestation of Jesus Christ but us we are the we are the manifestation of Jesus Christ to the world so when it come to this who you know what what Jesus wants to or what God wants to make manifest in this hour is you and I it's not someone else and so if it's going to be the the word made manifest see there's not another age there's not another group there's not even issue and I we are the ones to make this more than manifest you know many times people people when they when they look at things at the scripture you know they want to separate these things but you know if we can if we ever come to the place to realize that you know when he said we're brother have said when when you and I when we come to the place that we say I and my father are one not just not just something that we say but it's something that we actually believe and we see by revelation and so when you when you see that when you speak that then he said then the shock will pull like something will take place but you know that's something that we've got to be able to see and you know if if we are if we are the blood made manifest if we are the word made manifest he said he said you become the word as you received the word so you and our the word made manifest in our day then we are also the OEL and the line because that is because the only player because if the ol is the Holy Ghost then you know it's not that you know sometimes we have a hard time actually believing that I think sometimes that people understand that you know though if the Holy Ghost is on the inside you know and get into some of things that brother Ram said you know the Holy Ghost is on the inside and he said he said if you know he said that's a hole he said that old he said so here's the Holy Ghost and if we know what the Holy Ghost is he said he's the he is the he's the seal baby but he's also the revealer of the word he's the God he's the one that lead and guide you into all truth he's the one that will overcome when you can't overcome he's the one so it's not that we're waiting on something to come and it's not something that we're looking for something else because what we have need of lays inside of us the overcoming power lays inside of us so it's on the inside because later on we'll get to a brother branham talks about he said it's not just when wouldn't we look at the wine the wine is not just stimulation of Revelation but in the fourth seal brother Adam said it's the power of stimulation of Revelation well you have power see the thing is is if you have the Holy Ghost on the inside of he's if you have him by a new birth if he's birth to you by the word in the net and to your soul then there becomes a change in you but there's also a time that you're supposed to be growing but there also should be a stimulation take place because you know it's so amazing that people claim to have the Holy Ghost but you know there's things like there's no stimulation now I'm I'm not saying that we're all supposed to stagger around like drunk people but you know what that should something should take place you know because they should change the way you and and I understand you should change the way you think it should tell you to change the way you walk the way you talk and you know the thing is is there should be get the burning desire and if there's not a burning desire inside of you to be more like him that you know what we all need to be in the altar because there should be a change and it should be on fire and if it's not on fire than you know because when brother Branham talked about the the candlestick and he said he said when the candlestick was in there he said that flame was the holy fire of God and that was the Holy Ghost that would let that candlestick and he walked in the midst of it now was the same burning fire and he wanted to be made manifest he walked in the midst of the candlestick why because he was showing himself but you know what he was not showing himself as male but he was showing himself as female he was showing why because he was showing the bride on display and because that's what it is it has to be the bride on display why because he came and walked in the flesh and he in the end he stood there and he told him he said church the Scriptures he said and show me where I've missed it where did this where I haven't fulfilled the word in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me he's what he said he told him and Nero didn't even Nicodemus and the ones you know they had to rule it you know stand there and testify that he was exactly one thing what the scripture saying and you know what that's the same way you and I - hey you and I are the word big benefits sometimes I don't know about you I'm just gonna preach all myself nothing you know awake thou that sleepest why because sometimes we don't recognize who we are we don't recognize what lays inside of us what what lays in what is in store what what we protect what our potential is what we possess we don't we don't realize that and sometimes if we you know because the devil we allow the devil to just do whatever he wants to you know I was listening to brother band the other day and you know he's talking about Joshua you know Joshua was given a commission you know Joshua walk behind Moses and you know he'd see Moses and you know when Moses was on the backside of the desert he thought he was a failure and he was out you know God was bringing Moses exactly where he wanted and yet when he got when he got to that place that God spoke to him through a burning bush and you know he had his own supernatural experience with God it was a revelation to Moses of who he was and you know Joshua walked all of those years behind Moses and seeing the things and hearing and understanding and seeing what God had spoke through him and it come to pass and he went through all of that time and he saw all of the things that Moses but you know what God had his own experience and revelation to Joshua to who he was he said as I was with Moses so I'll be with you he said Moses my servant is dead but you know what he said there's still a commission that has to be done he said by calls he said Moses carried on out of Egypt he carried him through the wilderness he said we carried him over we've showed him the land the spies have went over they've taken the fruit they've brought it back and they brought the evidence back and showed that the land was exactly the way that God told them that it was going to be and he brought him right up there and he told him he said now it's time to sanctify yourselves and get ready to cross over and you know Joshua had walked all of those years but you know what Joshua had his own experience here because you know what God spoke to Joshua just like he spoke to Moses but he had his own experience and you know that's exactly what you and I've got to do we've got to get to a place where God gives us our own experience that matches together because that's not based on anybody else because let me tell you something brothers and sisters it burns inside of me but you know what I can't go in on anybody else's experience I can't experience anything else what anybody else has had I got to live on the experience that I've had from myself I think you know brother Dale can't carry me in brother way can't carry me in and you know what that help they'd hate to have to carry me in physically or naturally or spiritually anyway but you know what I mean brother Dale's shoulders are only so big but you know what you've got to have an experience for yourself but you know what the land is a gland before you is flowing with milk and honey is exactly the way that God said it was want to be but you know what you've got to go and experience that for yourself if you gave you go to the place that God can show you exactly what the word says that it's just for you you know Joshua had heard the word from from the prophet Moses and you know what he actually went into the land and so the people sold the land so everything brought the evidence back to the people you know what he was ready to go right then why because something that stirred inside him that he hadn't seen what God had promised him well my thing my question to you is if God's if God has showed you the same thing would you be sitting around one big do you say are you stimulated because you know what Joshua was Caleb was you know what they were ready to go you know in all those years of after they've seen after they'd seen that and walking around dealing with all of them stiff neck people and and all the problems that they had to deal with you know Caleb he never lost his revelation he never lost his zeal for what belong to him you know for all the years that he had to go through and all the things that he had seen you know the only thing that was holding him back was everybody else you know he had to walk around in desert for years and years and years and years and have to deal with all of that that foolishness but you know what Caleb never lost his zeal never lost his desire it was still a burning fire inside of him and you know what caleb was down there all the time and you know what he was doing he was sitting there sharpen his knife and a sword he kept it things why because he didn't know where he was going over but you know what there was one day he was going in 80 years old and you know what he told him he said you know I'm just as good as I was when we went in spies and got the grapes and seen all of the evidence and come back and gave them the good report he said I'm just the same man he said I might look a little old my lost some hair might have been gray might a little bit stoop-shouldered but you know what something burned inside of him that it was so strong that you know what you couldn't stop that's the reason when he went to Joshua he said give me my mount right one because they've been standing there waiting on it for so long your brothers and sisters you know what it's time to get out of here it's time to get to a place that you know what this this world it's not in my home we get sick and tired of living in this world in this pest house and when we get tired of it and you know what we can call for God's a Lord come take us home get us in the word Lord Jesus but if no well brother brother Jewell says wells he wells he woo we'd still dealing with the same problems but you know what if we if we get that desire you know waking we can go on you know you know God took care of him all those years he fed a manna he took care of their clothes there are clothes never wore out they said they never got sick all the things I went through all those 40 years and you know they never had a problem but you know what their biggest problem laid between their ears you know that's where their problem was they never got past that they got out of Egypt they never got Egypt out of them you got feed them God feeding them manna angels food supernatural food all the time but you know what they never did get past that and you know the day that they came up and and it was time to go into the land you know when they went in he said the manna ceased they said when no when they went in said it said they ate the old corner of the land you know what there was something else that was beyond what they'd already had there was a greater revelation brother Bram said it was stronger meat it was strong meat he said they were bigger stronger things of God that were beyond what they had where they had been they'd seen all these things they've seen all these miracles and God do everything and yet here was something else them to move on you know people you know we've come to a place you know there's a greater a wonderful bigger place for us to go to higher heights and deeper depths with God that's where you and I are we have to believe that that belong that it belongs to us brother brems says in in the third seal he says when the truth of a promised Word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with all they all get stimulated one is a stimulation glory he said I feel it now stimulated with joy shouts and when it does it has the same effect on them that wine does then does a natural man cause because when the revelation has been given of a truth of God and the true believer filled with all and the revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave himself uh normally glory maybe that's what's wrong with him now that's right it makes them behave themselves unseemly so God has a promise for us just like he had for the children of Israel and you know what it it should we should have a stimulation because it says if you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you receive the word then you know what there's a stimulation that takes place so we need to have some stimulation take place you know when you look at this this hole and the wine when you see this in the scripture you know grapes now in the scripture most all is made by olives it's olive oil remedy covers it in the church age book that's what was in the was in the lamp stance that they put in was olive oil hey you know great grapes they make wine and one of the interesting things I found out about this is you know the same process to make olive old they used to make one because the first the first step that takes place is you got a crush on you got to take the olives and you got a crush on and you got to crush the grapes to get the essence out of it and then you know they just crush them and they lay them the olives have to lay out because they say the essence of the aroma of the olives has to be marinating them to marinate the oil you know to be pushed out so it stays there and then when you push the grates you know you have to lay them out and then you know over time they start to ferment and everything but you know when you push those olives out and you just lay them and crushed in a in a paste or whatever they do then you know after they sit for so long then they have to put pressure on them you know they have to press them and you know what was so amazing was when they when they started talking about how much pressure has to be applied to olives to get the oil out of them they said sometimes I have to put as much as 400 atmosphere pressure on there and if you don't know what that is it's one atmosphere is equal to about sixteen point nine psi so if you calculate that out to around fifty eight hundred psi has to be put on olives to push the oil out of them and you know because you know there and then you know what struck me is you know people wonder why you know brother Graham said you know the life of a Christian he said when you become a Christian he said every gun inhales at you you know why do we go through the things that we go through you know here you are here you crush them and then brother branham said the only way that you get any good out of something is you have to crush it you know brother Brown was speaking in his life story and he was talking about when sister hope was dying and Sharon Rose was dying and you know he was talking about having to go through there and go see see his wife died and his daughter died and you know all the things that he had to go through and you know he said he went in there and he saw Sharon rose laying there and her the meningitis had got into her body and you know was ravaging and her eyes had crossed and you know he said you know she it was such a was and such you know a struggle for you know she was such laboring to breathing and everything under that strain of that meningitis you know he said I just couldn't look at her you know it was breaking his heart and he said you know because he we wonder why we have to go through things but you know that's the way God modes us through the things that we have to suffer you know he said Jesus was made perfect through the things that he suffered and you know many times we wonder why we have to go through these things why because it molds us into who who God wants us to be into molds us into his image and you know we you know we look at things and say well I don't know why God has you know allowed these things to happen but you know it was one of the ladies that I was talking to and I can't remember who was but one of the ladies I was talking to recently and you know she's telling me about all the different things that happened and in her life and you know she said but you know she said I know one thing she said I know all things work together for the good I don't understand why these things happen in my life you know why things have what happened you know it's happened the way they are you know everything such a struggle she said but there's one thing I know he said all things work together for the good he said that she said that's the one thing that I can hold on to because I know that's a promise of God you know we wonder why we have to go through things but you know that's what God has put us through to bring us to these things why because there's a pressure that's applied to us to mold us into who he wants us to be and so God wants us to be in his image and so we have to go through these things to mold us and you know there's a pressure that has to be applied but you know what it brings out what's inside those olives and you know the when you crush the grapes and you know you lay them up in the heat and and all that and you know you put them all through those things you know while while they have to go through those things why because it brings out the essence of what what's in those the grapes and everything there's a prayer and you know sometimes you know the the harder the battle in our lives sometimes you know it's the sweeter the victory you know many times we go through things and we wonder why if we went through them and we don't see it but you know there's one day we look back and you know we think I understand why those things took place and you know we can look back and thank God because many times we think we've been Forsaken and we're all alone and we struggle with these things but you know what these days we look back and we thank God you know what God brought to me through something God made because I can stand up and I can thank God for what he's brought me through because you know I may not I may not I've always come through everything exactly the way that I should have but you know what God's brought me through and I can thank God for what he's done in my life because like that like that sister said she said I may not be what I want to be and I may not be one or all to be but I can thank God I'm not what I used to be one because there's been a change take place so we thank God for the problems and trials and why because just like when job God knew what job could handle but you know what he had to prove to job what he could handle the job could come through those things you know it's a you know do we sometimes it's be nice to thank God thinks of us the same way thought of job you know he told you know he told Satan he said you know have you considered my servant job he's upright and perfect wouldn't it be amazing to God you know God said have you ever considered my servant my son what a wonderful how great he is because you know what he's got confidence in it right because you know he knows what you'll do with the work he'll know what you'll do in situations and he'll know and he's got confidence in you and you know sometimes we don't have confidence in ourselves but God has confidence in us you know sometimes we think well Lord how are we going to get how are we gonna get through this how you know how am I going to get through this and and all these type things sitting you know just like that man said one time you know there's a little story about the man and you know he was out mountain climbing he was in the dark and he slid down the mountain he called her one little brush and God kept telling me he's hanging on that thing for dear life it's the middle of the night you know it's dark and he's just hanging on that thing and he just prayin to God he just struggling holding on and the Lord kept telling him just let go he's like new Lorca he kept telling Lord kept I'm just let go he's like no he's just struggling holding on holding on he's getting tired but he was he was not gonna let go he's just struggling struggling struggling and lore kept trying to tell him just let go no he done that all night till the Sun come up when the Sun come up he realized he was only a foot up off the ground but you know what he said Terry struggled on I but God was trying to tell him there was firm foundation under him but you know what he didn't believe that say God don't God don't always tell us the situation he don't always give her but you know what he wants us to put our trust in him because you know what he'll bring us through many times we struggle with things and you know what God's just want us to turn turn loose can you let go and let God move if you can do that then God can come on the scene because sometimes he's already got you know because you know I got the answer he don't sometimes out of the answer he's always got the answer he just want you to trust him that you can step out and actually see what what God's plan is in these situations now this is a from the message the Pat miss vision and brother brems speaking of the of the bowls and they all and he and it's the from Zachariah where he has the vision of the trees and everything and he says the two trees represents the Old Testament and the New Testament and he said of course the old typifies the Holy Ghost who alone can give the light of God to the people he said the angel spoke to Zechariah was as much as saying this what you see means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the Holy Ghost say God wants us to put our trust in him because if we put our trust in him then he's got a plan he's got a way to work things out he just want you to trust him because you know what you can't do it in yourself because that's what he was showing see it's you can't do it in your own self and many times the Lord is just he's just gentleman enough to allow you to get out and work yourself up into a frenzy and not get anywhere and spin your wheels and get tired and you'll say would you like to try it my way they said it and said this bowl is filled with olive oil which floats through the seven weeks which are placed in the seven arms this is the same oil that burns and makes a light and the seven pipes and he continues on through the through the paten miss vision explaining the different the different things of how each each of the lamp was was lit and has the same Holy Ghost fire burning all lamps in all seven Church ages so it was the same Holy Ghost in every seven of the church ages it was the same fire of God that barked and so there's no difference in what took place in each age because it was he was the same yesterday today and forever and on the in the in the fourth seal brother rim sis speaking of the wine he said in the OL symbolizes the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit we find out that oil and wine is connected and worship always connected and worship and we always find in the scripture you always find the OL and the wine together and one other things when you when you go and study you start studying the whole and the wine the other thing that you find out another place that comes up in and Joel and some other places giving is when he talks about the oil and the wine because in Joel 2 when Joel start speaking of restoration coming we talked about the rain the form of rain in the ladder rain coming and he's right before he talks about the restoration of what the bugs ate down right before that he talks about restoring the all the wine and the corn because there's a corn because that was like the Old Testament when they went into the land there was the old corn of the land that they ate when they went in and so that was the restoration of the word but it was also restoration of power because that's what the corn was because that's what they were eating was but from the old because that was the strength that they laid over there that power that laid over there and so you know there's a there's the power they talks about you know when when the wine they said the wine symbolizes the power of the stimulation of Revelation then you also see where he talks about the corn of that they ate which was the you know eating the word and reached the the the power that came with the opening of the word and said with something that's been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer because it's presented by revelation see it's something that God said it's a mystery they can't understand it see after a while God comes down and reveals it and then vindicates it and then he says we remember if the truth is revealed the truth is also vindicated because you know if God ever come down and reveals anything he also vindicates it he never comes without vindication of the word because he's always done that all the way through because if God ever said anything he said when God said let there be light he said and there was like that was the vindication of it and you know the thing is if God ever speaks to you many people many people have you know as brother mystical say you know people say oh I got a revelation I got a revelation you know about you know you know they've got a revelation well you know what if they don't ever change your life and if ever don't ever make a change you know what you didn't get a revelation you know the thing is just like the Apostle Paul you know when he was going down the road you know what he had an experience that happened to him that you know what he was blind and you know all these things and God spoke to him you know what he had her head experience that changed his life because you know what he carried that that that what the blindness and you know the problems with his eyes the rest of his life you know he never could get away from that but you know here was a man that was very zealous in what he believed and you know he thought he was correct and living living in the Old Testament and and being a Pharisee of the Pharisees and you know being circumcised on the eighth day and all the things that he could look back and say you look what I've done in my life and you know what he said he didn't care he didn't consider any of that he considered it all done all that was nothing because you know what God come and spoke to him and he said you know because he said the Lord who art thou and he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecute us when there was something that come and struck Paul and then knocked him down on the road when he come to that place you know people had seen a change in him because you know they knew what kind of man he was and all of a sudden they come to see what kind of man he is wonder what the future you know the past you know people didn't want to have anything to do with Paul you know people didn't believe that that Paul was a changed man but you know what through their through his life through the his experience you know he just wasn't something that Paul talked about people seen there was a change in him and the way that he came because you know and what was so amazing was you know Peter walk with Jesus and James and the ones that with Jesus and and topped it and slep and all the things they talked about they could talk about handling Jesus and you know all the things that they had where was physical and all the experiences they had with him but you know what Paul had the Old Testament and he had a had a present-day revelation of what the Old Testament had to say but you know he had the same revelation that Peter had that he was preaching there and he said do you know all the way through the Old Testament and all spoke of Jesus Christ you know everybody just talked about it was it was do's and don'ts and rich Wilson and all these different things but you know what when it came to Paul you know he said he said you're dull of hearing he said we can talk about all those things but he said you know it's all Jesus Christ all those things that were written in the Old Testament all spoke of Jesus Christ and when he wrote it when he brought it to the present day and looked at see it was Jesus Christ all of those Old Testament prophets all they talked about and all over their lives manifested Jesus Christ but people didn't see that he says when God tells you anything heat and says you go do this and I'll be right with you for this is my word and he shows it in the Bible than God stands right behind that he said if it's not written in the Bible God stands behind anyway anyhow if it's God's Word he said now the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of moyen natural one is to stimulate and it brings a person that's all slumped down to us to a stimulation he said well not well then now there's a power of the revelation of the word gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it's vindicated it's proved it's called in the scripture as we went thought to refer to it as new one he said it's a natural one they said we always refer to it like that as these are drunk only ones see alright or spiritual one I think the best interpretation would be on spiritual one as the natural line reveals itself and stimulated power so does the new one as they reveals the Word of God which is spirit and then and that's say the word itself is spirit you believe that let's read it he said let's read it st. John six and he said something something said that let's say who said it goes on John st. John 6 chapter he said is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life he said the word itself is spirit it's spirit in Word form then you see when it's quicken or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work an acci because that now look here a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word and then a thought is presented it is a word now this is the this is God's thought has placed in the word and then when we receive it from him it becomes a word so we are to not only to hear the word because you he said God had a fault and then when he gave it to the prophets and they spoke it it become a word so it will become the word and you know the same thing is it has to be to you God can can come and speak to you but you and I have to speak the word also he said so when a spirit-filled born son of God he said when he takes the word and puts it on his lips and believes in his heart he said it's the same as deity speaking so when when God when God gives the word to us to speak then if we have faith and believe what he said and we speak it then it's the same as him speaking it so if just like just like when when a you know child goes through adoption when they come to that when they come to that place to adoption you know they can speak and do the things just like the Father it's just the same thing that the father says when they do it it's just it's the same thing and you and I are the same way if God gives us the word and gives us the promise that you know it's for you to speak it's for you to claim what God has said to you has given you these things so there's a there's a power that you have if we can speak because of work because the power comes through the spoken word so you speak in the word that you believe in the word and then we have a powers acts one says you know he said you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you there's a power that you can receive if you speak the word and believe it then there's a power that comes to you you know we're not we're not powerless we're no we're not we're not weak but you know what we have exactly what we have need of what we what we need and he said and you shall be witnesses you know a witness is somebody that speaks and as and knows something you know yeah there ain't no such thing as hearsay you know you can't you can't say what some l said you know there's very there's very strict rules in court on hearsay you know the the you know when you go before the judge you know what I heard so-and-so said to so-and-so and so-and-so I think we don't want to hear none of that you know we want to hear from somebody they won't know what you know what you saw what you heard that you can testify about not what not what somebody else's because you know the thing is is you can't say because you've got to know that he's real he said he that cometh to God must believe that he is so you've got to know that you got to believe that you've got to speak that for yourself you've got to know who he is and you got to speak for yourself to know these things and no way don't so don't believe them because you know it's not what the god of brother Dale or God of brother John or whoever else you know it's it's it's who that who do I serve you know he's a real to me not not what somebody else said he was do you do you know that he's Hebrews 13:8 is there some is there some place in the scripture that you've tried God and he's and he's not giving you that you know the scripture said God said prove me you know that he said prove me and see if I won't pour out the windows of heaven but you know he said he said the problem is and he said you know they have nothing you've not rounded to me you know in the Old Testament you know when he took the the Ark of the testimony you know we call it the Ark of the test you know covenant but you know it's also known as the testimony it's the Ark of the testimony why is it called the Ark of the testimony you know why because the scripture says that God told Moses to put those articles in that in the ark why because it was a testament against the people it was a testament against them why because they went out there and complained and they didn't and they didn't believe that God was going to take care of them said you know what he put manna in the ark why because he showed he took care of their physical needs why because they went out through there and oh you know they were so longing for the garlic's and the leeks and all the stuff from from Egypt but you know what God fed them and gave them exactly what they had need of you know what they didn't believe that God was going to lead them through but you know what he put Aaron's rod that budded in there and put the almonds in there and then you know when when he put the test when he put the tablets in there you know when the tablets were in there why because you know why the first set didn't even make it there why because you know when Moses went on the mountain and talked talk to God and God come and talk to Moses and wrote the word down for him you know what were that what were the children of Israel doing what were they doing they were down there committing idolatry with a golden calf and then Aaron was so silly when he wasn't totally for his brother went before the Prophet said oh I just threw a bunch of gold in and a golden calf popped out really here's a here's a man that's been 40 days before God getting the Word of God face to face ear to God's mouth roof through receiving the word and you know what they're down there committing idolatry and when Moses come off the mountain he took the tablets and he smashed the Golden Calf and you know what Moses had to go back and get to have you get the tablets again why because the second set went in there why because it was a Testament against there because you know what they didn't believe what God said why was it because you know and it's the same way with you and I the word has been given to you and I and you know what it's either a blessing or cursing to you he bugged one because you know what if we don't believe what God said he that he's gonna take care of us so you know it's a curse to us it's either your blessing or a curse one because if we don't believe we don't trust God to meet our needs and you know what if we and we go through things and we don't put our faith in God to meet our needs or whatever our problem is and turn it over to God and we go through problems and trials and everything like that and we wonder why why because we cannot put our faith in God people go through things and wonder why God don't bless them well you know what and sometimes you know if I had if I had people believe in me the way people put faith in God you know what I wouldn't do nothing for him either you know he stood there he said Williams talking to the children of Israel you know he said he said when he sent him prophets you know he said grace sent him a brazen serpent a walk that followed him the head water he said he gave him a pillar of fire a cloud by day and a fire by night he said he took Kevin done everything for him and you know what they still couldn't believe him all the things that they'd done through all through the Old Testament sent all the prophets the judges and everything else has sent him till then you know what they still turned his their back on him and Jesus come walked in walked in flesh John come on though on the river and went down there and told him said you know what he said he said I'm the one the voice of one crying in the wilderness but here's wanders walks among you he said I'm not I'm under worthy to unloose his shoes but you know what I sang baptize you in water but he said he'll come and baptize you in fire the Holy Ghost and fire here's exactly the one that God spoke through all the way from the beginning when Adam fell in the garden and he gave him and told him he said they'll come one he said that old bruised the Serpent's head he said but he'll bruise his heel but he said he'll crush his head he said he said when he walked out of the garden and he made a wait for the children to come back the Adam and Eve to come back because there was one that was going to come and cover that chasm that was created by Adam and Eve there was one that was gonna come and do that and when he came in flesh they didn't even believe him and you know what God's given us everything we have need of you know what whether we're the most blessed people or the most well God God has God has blessed us have more grace than anybody you know what there was all the people through the Old Testament and all the different ones Paul looking and and all the different people that desire to say are they the promises are laid in the scripture and you know what all those things have laid in our day you know it's not somebody else's good let's receive this you know what this is the endtime the word has become open the fullness of the word has been open there's nothing for us yeah else to come because you know what if if if God didn't come and fulfill his scripture through the word through brother Branham then you know what God's a liar God but you know what I don't he's not a liar but you know what everything that you have nito has been given you know and and all the all the mysteries and everything that has laid in the Old Testament all the scriptures that they're laid back there that people who have been desiring to see you know what you and I can read about he said he said why was prophecy he said now is history and you know what you and I are able to open up and read and see the things that God laid in the word that people have looked over for many many years many commentaries have been written many books many many hours of studying these things and you know what there was a little man that came from Kentucky you know hardly had any education nothing nothing to look at but you know what God spoke through him he was God's mouthpiece for our day you know I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ why because it's the power of God unto salvation why because it's the power of God to bring us out of here I'm not I'm not ashamed that I thank God that that he's allowed me to see these things but you know the thing is is we need to have have faith and believe what God is saying why because you're so blessed one because he spoke in this word if he come and he said that Malachi if brother Branham fulfilled Malachi 4 that he said he'd send Elijah the Prophet before the great dreadful day of the world of the Lord and that he would come and he would he would open the scripture and turn the people's hearts back to word that if that's true then guess what then that you and I are the same ones that we have received the work to take a body change we are the ones to whom the world the ends of the world are come all the scriptures that speak of our day you know we're a blessed people but do we actually believe that have we have we put our faith in that do however you know how we sold out everything to put our trust in him to put our faith in that word you know the scripture will finish here in a minute the scripture talks about the Jesus was speaking there and Lucan in and in Matthew and I think he's Matthew Mark and Luke he tolde tells the same story about the about the skins you know he says he said you know you can't put new wine in old bottles you know brother Brent talks about those old bottles he says you know they were made out of animal skin he said the animal skins because you know he said they animal skins had the oil still in them because the skin hadn't dried out and they were able to put the wine in those bottles because and you know he talks about there was a hundred on the day of Pentecost there was a hundred and twenty bottles up there waiting to be filled and he said you know they could expand with the pressure of that wine you know and God could could move in their lives and do the things and you know the same thing he said you can't have a dried-out try to have a Pentecostal experience and be all dried out and have your own formal ways about you you've got to have the OL of the Holy Ghost in you that you can expand that God can move you and grow and mold you into what needs to be done but see the thing is as brothers sisters do we actually have that do we actually say Lord moved me into what I need to be don't don't let me just become dried out in formalin and you know let let all the things the cares of life overtake me the Lord moved me into what I need to be because that's what I want to be I want to be though because you know I want to be the word made manifest I want to have the Holy Ghost and I want people to know it I want people to see when they look at me it's not Erin Roberts Stacy but I want people to see Jesus Christ I want people to know that there's something because you know it's not just some I walk down the aisle and I just walked up and I just told the preacher that I wanted want it to be saved or something I want something that's live and real I want people to know something that that's taking place not just some idea or general just we just come to church and pay ties or or just sit around you know we just talk about things in the message but I want it to be real I wanted something that's growing inside of me I wanted something living inside of me then when somebody sees me they know that I'm a Christian not just some because you know lots of times you meet people in the world and sometimes even in this message you meet people and you know what you can't even tell that they're Christians you can't even tell their message people why because they just want to hang out and see how folks they can get to the world and how much world that they can have inside of them and how much they you know they can try to balance themselves I don't want any of that I want I want to be solely sold out I don't want anything I don't even Justice the smell or the smudge or anything of the world on me I don't want to have any of that I want to be sold out where I'm totally oh gods I don't I don't want anything else I want I just want exactly what God wants me to me I want him totally to be surrendered and molded and just what God has for me to be because you know the thing is is you and I can come to that you know because there's a lot of young people I see young people and you know the thing is is you know in the the devil it will talk to you and the devil would tell you everything and he will point out all your faults and failures and you know what you can root you can listen to that and he can cause you all kinds of problems and I've seen kids that were drew it they grew up in this message and you know what one little problem one little fall or failure coming in our life and you know what Satan beat some down so let's you know what they don't even come to church anymore they just go out in the world why because they think they've send their way though away their day of grace but let me tell you something brothers and sisters you know what God is you know what if God ever deals with your heart you know brother and said hey still there's still grace for you there's still mercy for you but the thing is is you've got to believe that you know I know I want kids to see that I want the kids to know that no matter how old you are how young you are you know don't think that God's ever done we're done with you or there's some kind of problem if God's dealing with your heart there's still grace they're still mercy you know what if he's done it for one you know what he'll do it for another I don't know if I I think I've told this before by move and we'll tell it again the first time I got baptized I got baptized when I was eight years old me and Richard got baptized the same time and you know I was so excited to get baptized eight years old you know because I sing that was scriptural I wanted to get baptized and you know I you know I being eight years old you know there's you know there's only so much you really understand but you know I didn't know what was gonna take place but you know what I knew I need to be baptized but you know the day after I got baptized that Monday morning I woke up because I got baptized on Sunday the Monday morning I woke up that was one of the sickest I was sick the sickest I've ever been that day I was so sick I had I had some kind of stomach virus and let me tell you what I thought I was going to fall apart I hurt so bad and just just what you know and the whole time you know what I said around you know and the devil got on my shoulder you know he tried to tell me that I was wrong because I wouldn't got baptized and that's the reason I was sick and you know I said around you know and I felt so bad and I carried that for so long that I was under condemnation because you know being 8 years old you know what would you think if you if you went to go get baptized in the next day you're sick as you can be and I lived through that and you know and it was it was such a condemnation I lived under this cloud and it's like well lord what did I do wrong and you know and you know sometimes things happen in your life you know what that you know I look back at that you know maybe that's what God sitting me because you know what he wanted to make me stronger why because you know what if you try to walk before God and do what God wants you to do it's the devil's job to get in front of his dog it's his job to hinder you it's just his job to do everything that he can to stop and for me to walk around as an eight-year-old kid wondering what I'd done to deserve that you know God God's punishing me for something you know it hindered me but you know what he took me a while to get over that and you know many times thing well things happen in our lives we don't understand but you know what don't let the devil get in before you and get in your mind and tell you things that are contrary to the word because you know what if God puts it in his word for us to bleed and repent and be baptized then you know what just expect the devil to come against you whatever happens is for a reason but you know what God is able to bring you through and show you that his love because you know God wants you to follow his word that's the reason they gave it to us and the other thing if God give his word and you say well I can't I can't make it I can't thought you know what God is able to bring you to the place that you can do that if they're if God has given his word for us to do it just like that just like that little black man said that time you know hey they said well what happened if you know if the Lord told you to go jump through that wall he said well if it was in the Bible for me to jump through that wall he said I'd take off running because if God's obligated to put a hole there when I got to the wall it's my it's my job to do what I do my part and you know what then God's obligated to do his part let's do it let's just do our part let's be faithful and what God has called us to do amen god bless you this evening we're all standing how the musicians come but just be faithful and what God has called us to do let's sing it little song I want to live the way he wants me to live I don't know what key we're gonna be in if that's what I want I want to
