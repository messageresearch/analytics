amen good to know the Lord amen good to know each other good to be back good to know that you still have service on Sunday yeah I know but sister Johnny she uh she wrote me a very short eight page email about why I should go and then why I should stay and then why I should go and then why I should stay so but anyway good to be in the house with the Lord we have been gone a lot so just keep us in your prayers and we just want to do what the Lord wants us to do not what you guys want me to do we want to do what the Lord wants us to do so uh if you would have you seat just a second I'm going to give you a little short testimony at while we were while we were out and June can probably help me with this a little bit but uh we were um we were at brother claud's and we were going to be at watch not service on the 31st so my wife and sister Jinger they go to Walmart shop and she drops some of our bills and they go flying in the wind or whatever one bill okay one bill and they they go flying into anyway that she loses the the water Bell or she doesn't know what bill it is at the time I don't think but you did okay knew it was a water bill cuz she knew she was in trouble if she didn't find that bill right turn the camera over there she and you she knew she knew she was going to be in trouble if if we didn't find the water Bell cuz uh one of them had got stuck somewhere last month and it was a little late and you know how I am about late bills we don't have them so um right so anyway so anyway we she do she doesn't tell me about it so remember sisters your sins will find you out some way or the other but um no and he did take care of that because here we go and we we go to watch Night Service and and we're sitting in the back at at brother claude's Church in the fellowship hall and we're we're having lunch before we get started and this sister walks up that I'd never met but one time before uh didn't know exactly who she was so they told me who she was and she hands you in an envelope that's not the strange part of it she lost it in Bartlesville it wound up in cany or in or in or in Dewey Kansas Dewey Oklahoma 15 miles away and it ended up on This Woman's windshield ain't that something ended up on This Woman's windshield that was coming to church that night that didn't know us from anybody I mean it had way and June Dale it had up here on the top and it had the city of or Banks County water department or whatever it was and somebody had found it and somehow it got stuck on her windshield she walked out of the shop and come in and I mean what what would that I mean give me the odds of that give me the odds of somebody finding it and then it wind up 15 miles away in another parking lot attached to a sister's car that obviously nobody in that town knew she was going to church that night to meet us she just hands the envelope to me and says here I believe this is yours or hands it to one of us we were sitting there and said I believe this to me yeah she hand it to me and I said what is this cuz I didn't know we'd lost anything at that time I didn't know I'm sure she would have told me years later but but just see how God works I mean amen you your name amen but remember you see how God takes care of the little things amen I mean that's totally it's not significant at all really but it is yes he does if I can interr the sister that found it had been coming to church with her daughter and she just did not know where she was supposed to be in church and that's I said sister Nancy how did this happen she said I don't know sister but I've been wondering if this is where I'm supposed to be and I said the Lord has told you that you are and I mentioned it to Sister G and Gail said I believe the one that created the wind cuz I mean it was windy as I mean amazing she said the one that created the wind picked that up and put it on sister windsh that's the truth 15 miles away on the very sister's car that was coming to church that night go figure I mean you know this God was working on both ends cuz he answered her prayer and he also kept her out of trouble so but we laugh about it but you know those little things that it all comes together and that's what we're going to talk about tonight let's stand this afternoon is the uh and actually uh you know I told you a long time ago dad and I we don't discuss what we're going to preach so you're going to you're going to hear the same sermon over again um actually Isaiah 53 and all the scriptures we're going to read them again but if you would turn to Genesis 1:26 and we'll start there but what a wonderful testimony I mean God just really uh moved in that sister's life whether we found it or not that wouldn't matter it was a check and we could have rewrote a check and resent it I mean that was no big deal there was no cash in the in the envelope but just to be on that sister I mean Claud and I sat there and we tried to do it with a calculator and it's into the hundreds of thousands of of close to over a million um odds of that ending up 15 miles away on a sister's car that was coming to church that very night and was questioning whether she should come to that church or not so uh we thank God for that and she actually didn't know who she knew me by name and she knew us by name but she didn't know really who we were cuz she had just been coming a few times and uh she was connected in the church by marriage a long time ago but that's all said and done but U you love the Lord amen we did have a good time and we you know we we take this gospel we take this gospel when we go we don't take a different gospel we take the gospel of of Jesus Christ that uh that comes for for from here because we are what we eat right we are what we eat whether you like it or not you are what you eat so we're going to speak today on the Journey of Genesis 1: 26-28 now what we've been doing is we've been giving you the characteristics of Genesis 1 we've been giving you the uh uh what it is and what it's uh what the Tendencies and likeness and and what the we've been talking about DNA we've been talking about gene expression and we've been talking about this man and I think we've come to the conclusion that that it's a very special uh part of God that was created here in Genesis and um as we've been speaking about before it's we got to bring it down though because if it if it happened in Genesis just like the Tree of Life when brother Brown said we were hanging on the tree of life that's down here that's right here where we are today so that's kind of what uhu what we're going to be speaking on so let's bow our heads before we get started Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you would come Among Us father in a special way that you'd bless each one that here that you sanctify us for our journey Lord that you would be the speaker Lord and also be the hearer and be the one that does the does the seeing and all Lord that we may understand you a little a little better Lord we pray that you would just bless the ones that are not here the ones that are sick Lord take care of them and be with them Father be with the little bride around the world be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields Lord just give them fruit for their labor father we ask that you'd forgive us of our sins and many mistakes that we make toward you father just bless this day take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name amen Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness now we all know these Expressions so I'm just going to continue to read this and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God in the image of God created he him him male and female created he them and God blessed them so this group of people we say is blessed God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth so listen what I'm trying to say is they're not stuck in the Garden of Eden right they're not stuck back there trying to develop their s they're that that that group of people is supposed to multiply replenish subdue um Dominion so it's not just that they're going to be stuck in the garden of meeting that's all they got to do now there's a there's a there's a journey of this of this Genesis 1 man that's got to come down through time and it's got to be in continuity with the word of God and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so now let's go to Isaiah 53 where brother Dale was this morning then we're going to read the same scripture he read Wednesday I mean last Sunday Isaiah 53:9 we're going to start with verse n and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul I want to right I want to show you there that Soul when he shall make his soul an offering for sin now remember his body was beaten and bruised and his by his stripes were healed and all those things that that was the body Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world that was the son of man that was the god in human flesh but this right here that his soul the soul of Jesus Christ right almighty God when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see a seed cuz that's where his seed reside not in his Natural Body he shall prolong his days and the plagge of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul okay talkinging about his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he has poor he's he's sharing right you will get to that in a minute he's sharing he's not keeping it for himself he's sharing amen remember God is Elohim he is self-existing he doesn't need us to exist he doesn't need air to breathe he doesn't need an earth to stand on but he decided that he wanted that he had attributes to that really compelled him to do it it was his desire God has desires right all right remember he desired it all be saved but it but it's up to me and you whether we are or not therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he ha poured out his soul unto death now the soul my soul this soul of this individual can't die right but he poured out his soul unto death right all right played the part of death death the prophet said and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressor now let's go to John 1:1 let's um let's read between the lines you want to do that just not going to change the word in the beginning was Genesis 1:26 and 27 right and Genesis 1 126 and 27 was with God right and Genesis 126 and 27 was God Amen that's too close brother now I don't think we got far close enough yet the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him remember that was the logos the theophonic he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as that Genesis 126 and 27 received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God Amen even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood remember that Genesis 126 man is not born of blood there's no blood in that Genesis 126 man nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and Genesis 126 was made fles exactly amen nobody's left yet and Genesis 126 was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated and the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word that's why I want to bring this thing down just a little bit closer we know that that in studying Genesis 1:26 and and like I say again thank you the Sunday school class I'm using my my uh iPad I've been using it out and I really enjoy it I've been getting getting to used to getting used to using it thank you for it it really helps cuz you can really put your thoughts down and then you thoughts can be expressed on on the uh oh brother Joe's got a chart back there and uh it breaks down what you can hear is so much a percent retention and what you can see is so much retention what you can see and here and what's put up on the screen there's so much more retention so it's not just that you read something or you hear something you retain it a lot better if you see it so we're going to look at this today and pull up the first quote if you want to in 1957 questions and answers on Hebrews in Jeffersonville that brother brandham said that's Genesis 1 where he created man in his own image which was in the theophany so are we okay to say that Genesis 126 is theophany that's what he said right here all right so you argue with him and in Genesis 2 he made Man Out of the Dust of the earth now that's animal flesh that's the what you're looking at now which was the human man that we have now and then in three was to fall and was kicked from the Garden of Eden now whatever that was and I'm giving you the I'm asking you the question whatever that was then as the fall developed and we'll we'll look at it in number two but don't pull it up right yet there was something Lost In the Garden of Eden the ability to produce this Genesis 1 was lost in the Garden of Eden we went through that before all right but we see those words up at the top I want you to kind of keep looking at them because all the quotes from the previous sermons we've had brother bam said that that was theophany logos a spirit being uh the Holy Ghost Christ uh it definitely is a supernatural being whatever it is a supernatural Genesis 126 and 27 man whatever you want to whatever you want to deal with it was a supernatural being it wasn't a natural man and it wasn't all mankind that's right it wasn't all mankind because here you see as we go over it again in Genesis 1 the word God was used 30 times and that means Elohim self-existing does not need anything to exist and he's God all right now in Genesis 2 you see the word Lord God come into being which is Jehovah with a family so you see him putting the 126 man and the 27 man but as he made this Genesis 126 man and it it was in plurality which he says them them is plural all right I want you to keep that word them and they because later on in the sermon we're going to bring it back out because Jesus absolutely absolutely identified that Genesis 1:26 in a prayer that he prayed and we'll get to it in just a little while all right because you look at the days and the thems because really uh I guess he didn't want Moses to spend time because see if Moses would have had time he could have wrote all the names down but he didn't it's just it's a group of people it's them it's they right it's a group that comes under this this uh spirit being Holy Ghost the Christ the Creator I I want us to see that that God is is not he's not EMP he's not totally emptying himself out but he is giving part of what he is to somebody else right okay he's giving part of what he is to somebody else that's what it is in Genesis 1: 126 so it's a supernatural being brother Bram called a theophany now we look at that word and we keep that word theophany now let's go to to number two two but remember one thing for sure whatever this Genesis 126 man it is the characteristics of God right it's the characteristics of the almighty it's it's his DNA or his gene expression like Daddy was saying this morning Adam and Eve if you were to do a DNA test they come from the same Source now there's a key to that because June and I have been married for 34 years we're one but we're not one like that one I'll read you a quote in a minute where brother BR separated and brought it out but but listen Adam I mean Eve came out of Adam the very DNA a very piece of Adam came out and was made Eve so he was not lying when he said she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh she was literally that amen so guess what in the Garden of Eden it was only supposed to to be one DNA Adam and Eve that was it one gene expression and that was supposed to come from Adam and Eve but we know what happened in the garden that her womb was polluted so God couldn't bring us right but we see that there was something else that was lost and we see here in Revelation CH 5 1961 says now our Kinsman is handed now we're going to read this one again but I cut a little bit off of it to save time sister Trudy told me to slow down so let me slow down a minute Revelations 5 now our Kinsman has handed the seven sealed book of redemption from the original owner the original owner look what he said when we lost it right when we lost it so we're represented with Adam and Eve when we lost it at the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner but but there's been a poacher on the land a squatter that's Satan he came over he's a poacher this Earth don't belong to him belongs to God but he's a poacher a squatter man how I could say something right now but I better not it's a title deed of our Redemption this seven seal book it's the title deed you wait till we get to those seals now let's go to number three souls in prison now 1963 now notice when this Redeemer John looked around and here sat God on the throne with a book in his hand now that was the same book that Adam had could you say Amen somebody may be watching man I want to make sure there's some people here here sat God on a throne with a book in his hand that had been sealed with Seven Seals and the whole Plan of Redemption was in it right it had been lost by the human race Adam and God it went back where Satan couldn't take it he just caused him to lose it but where did the book go to then right didn't belong to the human race amen the blessings didn't belong here here the human race had lost it so it went back went right on back to its original owner that was God so it went back and Adam was not able to produce this Genesis 126 I you ought to see right there if the womb was polluted if the if the natural womb and the spiritual womb of Eve was polluted then there's no way for this Genesis 126 person to develop right God's got it now that's why God said in other words like I was saying it it was an it was a conditional Covenant then it became an unconditional Covenant amen cuz God said you can't do it Adam I'm going to do it now I'm the only one that can hold the book and keep it straight amen I'm the only one that can bring my children the way I'm supposed the way they're supposed to be brought all right and remember we talked about the weight of the tree if you look at some of these key points here the way to the tree it wasn't that the tree was lost it was just the way to get to the tree was lost all right but now remember like I said God is not going to God could have been real selfish and say well I'm just going to stop right here and I'm not going to do this anymore I I've Adam and Eve's done messed this thing up and they were the two greatest things I had and and they were the greatest things on earth and they were supposed to produce this and I told them to do this and I told him not to do that I'll just I'll just not do anything no that's not what he did right cuz he's had a desire in his heart to get that out he had a desire for that Genesis 126 man to develop cuz that was his children he was a father what a great father he wanted to get his kids out so he could talk to them he wanted to get his kids out so he could so so he could actually like brother Brown said play with them like a child playing before the before the father's door you see that all those things that brother Brown was telling us it's a way of expression but it's exactly the ability to produce what he said Adam couldn't produce what God Said Eve definitely couldn't produce what God Said but God can produce what God Said but that put us all then on equal basis it all put us on free moral agency where all of us have a choice Adam had a choice Eve had a choice all the way down through we have a choice thank you Lord but now look we're going to start here and look at something brother brandham said if you can't see Christ in every verse amen go back and read it again all right now if we see Christ see I see Christ in Genesis 1:26 because that's what we that's what that developed into okay Paul said it's Christ in you the hope of glory so Christ the lamb the Holy Ghost brother Brown said the same it's titles to the same person so it's the Holy Ghost you said no it's Christ well Christ and the Holy Ghost is the same person amen so anyway but we were given a law you see that L we were given a law to go by which it wasn't really A law but it was God in letter form but man took it as a law because of our carnal mind the problem with it is that we became carnal we became carnal Man became carnal they man wasn't spiritual much in the New Testament I mean the Old Testament we were talking this morning if you'll look at this it really help you because we're on patience on Statue of a perfect man we're up to patience patience is not mentioned in the Old Testament not one time that's right amen it's mentioned 33 times in the New Testament but it's not mentioned one time in the Old Testament a lot of them didn't have patience like sister Trudy said a lot of things was ugly that happened in the Old Testament that you can't type Christ but you see Christ working right you see him anointing you see we're going to read in just a little while that that even brother R said we were with Noah amen we were with Noah because of Noah Noah's anointing we were with Noah Hebrews 10:1 same one D was quoting this morning but watch how that develops out of that Old Testament because watch for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things image right amen see these words for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things now we were made in the image of God amen amen and we were going to be developed but we couldn't be developed in the Old Testament cuz God had the book and there was no way like I read you the quote last time and and brother Dale read it too that God had to come in human flesh before that Eternal Tree of Life remember the quote before that Eternal Tree of Life could do us any good it had to be human flesh first because we fell in human flesh and there was nobody worthy in the Old Testament no one no one was called a Son of God in the Old Testament except Adam right okay right a Abraham was called a friend of God not a child of God right amen amen that's a great revelation there because we were there yes but there's no way that could get into a body right it could anoint the Christ could anoint in the Old Testament and and such a great anointing till Moses face shine amen but then when that came away it was just Moses there wasn't enough to hold him that's right cuz he would have I mean killed an Egyptian he was a murderer for then would they not have ceased to be oh I'm sorry but not the very image of things can never with these sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the C there un perfect that's the Old Testament up until John the Baptist those sacrifices were made because there was no new birth there that's right amen if not the C would be made perfect one time he made a sacrifice it'd be perfect that's right cuz you and I once the sacrifice is made we're perfect right because we have the new birth inside of us not as just a anointing and a lifting off an anointing sure there's different anointings but it's the one that John the Baptist the holy spirit said the one you see the Holy Spirit come on and remain amen cuz I'm sure he probably saw kyus and all these different ones the Holy Spirit would anoint him and John being a prophet he could see that remember how that brother brandham we were talking about last night brother Bram saw the two brothers in the church in the Pentecostal Church one was one was prophesying the other one would speak in tongues and one would interpret the one speaking in tongues he shook his hand he said he's a he's a real solid Christian but this brother over here was living with another woman and had two children by her he was wondering well it was in brother Brown saw the anointing on the man that's why he couldn't understand same way with John the Baptist so the Holy Ghost had to tell him say the one you see go on and remain amen that's the one that's going to be the savior of the world Amen these little things help you maybe a little bit for then would they have ceased it was offered year by year it was offered every year why couldn't make you perfect pretty simple for then would they not have ceased to be offered right because that the worshipper once purged should have had no more conscience of sins that's what I want to we were talking about last night and you know all these people that that believe that you were you come here with eternal life and you had this eternal seed in you come on people we don't believe believe that right right not that way we believe what brother BR said but I you know they always used a woman at the well this seed come alive right well now why didn't it come alive in Peter James and John right amen while Jesus was here that's right you ever thought about that brother Bram said he come alive I know it did it quickened what she held but Peter James and John all those disciples they were with the word every day why didn't that seed Quicken right oness with brother BR said God wasn't in them yet that's why right but once God they went to the upper room and got the Holy Ghost God was in them then amen that's right that's what we believe it's just it's just it's like teren said it's you know it just does way with salvation if you say you come here with eternal life does way with the whole Plan of Salvation there is's no Plan of Salvation cuz we don't need it no we were lost right the seed was with God Amen the seed was that Genesis 126 and 27 I hope you can see that that's why I said those people that preach that they don't understand SE the seed of God they don't understand Genesis 126 they don't understand a soul they don't understand what a theophany is right sorry they just don't they've not been taught well enough right sorry amen but in these sacrifices there was REM remembrance again made of sin every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin right so during the Old Testament there was nothing there there was no there was no indwelling of God that could make them perfect amen that's right for it's not possible that the blood bulls and goats should take away sin wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou pre prepared me we know the prophets that's what they did they prepared the body of Jesus so that Jesus could walk out on the what on the word he was the word right amen John 1:14 the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and he had us in him right we didn't come here with him and US amen for unto you is Born This Day Luke 2:11 listen to this catch this for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord so Now where's Genesis 126 if Genesis 126 is the Christ where is it where is it it's sent a baby called Jesus but he had to come in human flesh cuz we were lost in human flesh we that's simple we all know that that's right but there's gen there's the Genesis 3:15 seed right Christ the book remember I read the quote the other day to a to a group of people and and they kind of look at you with you know when when your eyebrows kind of go up like that they you know the computer's turning or something's going on you know because brother randam said in adoption series he said Jesus didn't come to bring you your inheritance right he didn't come to bring you your inheritance your inheritance was that Genesis 126 before the foundation of the world he came to bring a way to get you back to that inheritance amen he said I am the way the truth and the life I'm the way to get back so there's the way to get back to the book cuz he couldn't trust it with anybody else he couldn't trust it with Moses he couldn't trust it with Elijah he couldn't trust it with name your name in the Old Testament he had to come himself but he came with that ability to produce you and I amen amen if you don't see Christ in every verse I say if you don't see you in every verse right exactly if Christ is in you the hope of glory if you can't see you in every verse right that Luke 211 that to me that identifies where that Genesis 126 man landed hello the theophany of God yes how powerful there was the creator there was the one that said let there be but there was the one that said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing right amen but now we were in a book when we were born that's right remember we were put in a natural book brother Brown said your name was written in the book at your natural birth but then your name was transferred now we know there's not an angel sitting up there transferring names he's just showing us how that we were hung on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil like we said before right we all came here on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen we didn't come here in the tree of life that's why we didn't have eternal life when we got here brother Bram said after you're born again you're hanging on the Tree of Life remember the quote after you're born again you're hanging on the tree of life so your name's got to be transferred that's what he's talking about right amen from your natural life if you stay that way then you're going to have to be judged by that natural life right the tree of knowledge is works right ain't that what Cain did amen works works works works works right but the tree of life is it's not what you do it's what he done Glory chosen in him before the foundation of the world not chosen by him right chosen in him there's a difference those little words make a difference but remember in Isaiah he said he would see his seed Not seeds exactly one seed Galatians 3:16 there's one seed which is Christ but it's in a multiple form but there's the theophany of God Amen but now remember let's go to Christ's revealing his own word let's back up just a minute we know where Christ was but now remember Christ showed up in the Old Testament not Jesus Christ but Christ showed up in the Old Testament right so now if now we're going to read this and I want you to keep that word theophany in your mind right and what I said that theophany was Genesis 1:26 man right and didn't we prove that brother Brown already said that okay all right I'm trying to bring this together to show you that that let me just give you the punchline if Christ is in you the hope of glory you were there from the foundation of the world the eternal life that's in you always was eternal amen but the reason and I've said this many times before but the reason we can understand the Bible the reason that that book is now open is because we're that book amen we're not reading it as a secondhand information we are the book that was written on and it was written in the Old Testament too right amen that's why I can see what Moses did did Glory just like Moses saw what Adam did right amen amen Moses wasn't there when Adam and Eve did what they did right God just pulled him up a big television one day and said here write this down right so he wrote it down what happened in the garden well that's what God's given us a vision not a television but a vision Amen brother BR said television was in the Garden of Eden right okay all right he was alive in the Old Testament manifested I just want to let you see a little something here if you can stand it watch when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament as we believe it now you preachers out there you can argue with it do whatever you want to but I'm talking for my what I think see when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament in a theophany right in the person of MDC right not a priesthood amen but a person the man Capital him for this man had yet not been born but he was in a theophany so he had no father no mother he was God himself he was manifested in the form of a man called King of Salem which is king of peace and king of righteousness see he was mzc he had neither father nor mother beginning of days or ending of Life see it was Jesus in the theophany in the form of a man could you get it all right right but that man mezc couldn't die for you he couldn't be your savior he couldn't even be your brother come on okay but there's that theophany there and then Moses Moses said God I want to see you it was a back part of a man who was it Jesus Christ but who was it me and you right amen we were in him right amen oh I wish we could see that I wish we could really see that number five so we got mzc we got Jesus Christ in the form of mzc but it's not Jesus the flesh now we understand that cuz that man mzc everybody understand that I know you've been taught that 100 times mzc couldn't die for you so he couldn't be your Kinsman right Boaz had to be kin to Naomi right to be able to do the right of Redemption all right and do you know that legally Boaz could claim everything and keep it for himself but he gave it to Naomi just like Christ claimed everything but he wanted to give it to us and I'll read it to you in just a second now look number five let's close our eyes to our imaginations for a few moments and go back into the four there was anything the great Fountain of all eternity was that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of honesty Spirit of tress in this Perfection then out of the existence of the father went to logos which was the son which was the theophany right see there's your Genesis 126 man right there that's right oh Church we've been veiled we've been veiled since the beginning of time amen that's right but today we're able to look back and see that which was that which is and that which is to come cuz the book's open amen right cuz if you're another part if you're a different part of God you're a second person of God you're the devil that's right yes brother Bram said if you see two in the Bible one's God he said the other one's got to be a devil so we better stay in God Amen we better stay in God Amen which was the theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body that's the logos the words spoke out of them great fountains in the beginning was the word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word right then that theophany was made flesh in the person Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the Trinity bless brother Brown's heart he knew what he was talking about all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him both father son andly Holy Ghost all in that and that's the very way we go come on right do we catch these little things and that's the very way we go Plum back to the original beginning of God exactly do you know one thing's for sure the only reason he was a fullness of the godhead B is cuz you were in him amen oh my right how about that exactly the only reason he was a fullness of the godhead bodies he had all that Genesis 126 man in out of him that made him the fullest that made him father that made him son that made him holy ghost that made him his children made manifest in another form I may run in a minute daddy said something about being Pentecostal I may just F about five minutes may be one all his bride was in him that's why catch that that's why he was the fullness of the godhead B that's why brother Dale 50 years ago preached that the Bride of Jesus Christ is the fullness of the god godhead bodily why cuz that was what was made him the fullness of the godhead bod as the bride you see all he's got other manifestations sure he does sure he does but you know what I have other manifestations too but I'm a Daddy to my children right right they're the greatest God thinks the greatest of his children all right so let's just put it that way we know he's all these different things but there's one thing for sure when he came here on Earth he had one purpose in mind right to get his kids out of him just like you and I if we were all knowing if we were omnipotent if we knew everything that was going on do you know we would know how many kids we had it would just excite us to no end to get those kids out cuz there's no way to fellowship with them while they're inside of you you got to get them out so God knew exactly how many kids he was going to have so he knew he was going to have to come and and get them out of him some way so he had to release a life because it was in that capsule that I was telling you about there was a capsule of flesh called Jesus amen amen but his soul is what he gave a ransom Glory I don't have it up here and don't go to it but it is in did I write it down maybe I didn't oops I may have left it back there but somewhere in the Book of Matthew Matthew 2028 Jesus says he gave his soul a ransom or he gave his life it says he gave his life a ransom Life Soul whatever you want to call it that's what he did and then in Isaiah 53 it didn't say his body he said his soul he gave his soul an offering for sin he gave his own being his own self uh because you know why you and I were in it Glory so he comes down and he preaches he has a three and a half year Ministry and he preaches and he shows the word so that you and I can come forth cuz remember we're word born children right that's why you have to hear the word first before you're born again you have to hear the word before it can be quickened amen can't just come here with eternal life and just say well I got it you know that's it that's right you can't do that show me one place in the Bible where somebody just got the Holy Ghost cuz he was who he was except Jesus not one person they all had to hear the word they all had to while the word was being preached well while the word was being preached while you look in the book of Acts look at the Ethiopian unit right why didn't the word just Quicken to him right there while he was on The Chariot right right he didn't have the Holy Ghost amen he didn't have the new birth he didn't have nothing to Quicken with he could read right but philli a man the Bible says full of the Holy Ghost so if he was full he had enough to give out right so he give some to the Ethiopian unic and guess what God quickened the word to him amen just keep his little thoughts in your mind but he swed the word and I wrote a a comment down here back there in the back it's our nourishment the word is our nourishment that's where we come from We're word born children so God put the word here remember he didn't bring us here and then write the Bible right and I'm not talking about just the written written word right right he didn't we didn't get here and and and then this this came later the word came first in the beginning was the word word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that's why I said Genesis 1:26 we're in this word right here right amen this is our gene expression this is where our family members are come from like brother Dale was preaching there on on the Masterpiece family this is the same thing amen this is the Masterpiece family it's just in a little different little different way where were we the ministry of Jesus Christ all right now I want you to look now in John 17 Jesus prays John 17 verse 9 you can read the whole thing but I'm going to bring this out but I want you to look at all these I I highlighted them they these them cuz who's he praying for right who you praying for I pray for them in the beginning was word word with God and Word was God Genesis 1 126 six and God said let us make man our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea foul of the air and they have dominion right them and they you see what I'm talking about I pray for them I pray not for the world so he's praying for a specific group of people that's right but for them which thou Hast given me for they are thine amen and all mine are thine and thine are mine right but he didn't keep it in yourself no and I'm glorified in them right exactly that Running Fit about time boy when I read this other day I didn't even have it in a sermon and I sitting at home and that's that's when I get my anointing is when I'm at home here I just preached what I got bless where was I John 179 I pray for them I pray not for the world for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them John 17:20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also that Shall Believe on me through their word in other words the ones that's with him and the ones that's coming all right that they may be one exactly as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that th has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them right that they may be one amen even as we are one amen i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one amen now Jesus was perfect so he was talking about us perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and H has loved them right as thou H has loved me amen amen right I'd post that on my wall CU that's God's prayer that's Jesus's prayer and that's what protects us amen that's our protection right there that's our all in all that's our that's our Perfection cuz if they're perfect and we're in them we can't be imperfect we got to be perfect amen all right Isaiah 53 let's read that one more time yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he ha put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the Pleasers of the Lord shall prosper in his hand amen couple more and then I want to read you one long one but I think it's very powerful now this number six we're going to read 1957 we're going to see our identification we all know that when when Jesus was here that after this John 17 that he went to Calvary and he died for our sins we know that here he goes where did he leave when he left this is in Tuma the Bible said he ascended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the longsuffering of the days of Noah amen his soul his Spirit his theophany of his own being went down right amen didn't we say Genesis 126 was theophany righten I've said many times times before maybe this will help you again you've already been to Hell right you ain't got to go no more amen exactly you went down there and got the keys from the devil right in that theophany form it listen we can't be a second person right right his theophany of his own being went down let's follow him would you like tonight to follow him a few minutes let's see where he went then we kept on going but let's read Revelations right here now we'll go back to the same quote that we read before but we we're going to go down to the the red letter part go to the number seven well actually actually it's number right there just leave it right there now our Kinsman has handed a seven seal book of redemption from the original owner original owner when we lost it in the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner but there's been a poacher on the land a squatter and that's Satan he came over he's a poacher this Earth don't belong to him belongs to God but he's a poacher a squatter man how could I say something right here but I better not it's it's the title deed of our Redemption this seven seal book it's the deed you wait till we get into those seals now here's the rest of the quote that I didn't put at first he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people right he gives the inheritance that he inherited amen right becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people amen that's his love for us now number seven am now we know how you and I came forth but I um I want you to see this in the sman church age see how this works God always had his thoughts for Adam Adam as his thoughts as yet unexpressed right Psalms 139:1 15-6 will give you a little idea of this my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously WR in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance were fashion when as yet there was none of them in other words God knew it he knew who you'd be wrote it in the book and then in continuance or in succession you came forth right Glory that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when Adam was formed of the Dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought expressed and those Eternal thoughts were now manifested amen everybody with that say Amen wake up now it says that he has wait a minute down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah John the Baptist you got that yep John the Baptist each one of these were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the logos he was a perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be amen now it says that he has chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality that's right amen Eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that amen amen amen you can't get away from it that's right there's the DNA of God there's his children that's the on that's going to be made manifest that's right now let's read number eight it's a good book to read here Oneness with God now watch brother R explain this if you'll notice how that Eve was United with Adam she became part of him God did you notice in Genesis 1:27 he created man male and female created he them now the man was both male and female when it come to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then God took from his side a rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit amen right everybody understand that right the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished God took from the side of Adam a rib and made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of Adam for he was both man and woman spiritually speaking both masculine and feminis so actually Adam and Eve like I said before had the same DNA they were they actually come from the same body amen now if that was in Eden and to be redeemed we got to get back to that that's right now like what somebody said one time said you know in the Garden of Eden God closed up the womb the wound that Adam had remember the Bible said he closed the W closed the wound up and made Eve well now when Christ hung at Calvary he was pierced in aside the bride got out and left it open so the bride could get back in cuz we got to be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh not in the same way as me in June right that's right you can't do that cuz that's not restoration that's not redeeming right amen redeeming is not me and her going back as separate people right right everybody understand what I'm saying amen when he says bone to my bone and flesh to my flesh you better know we got to mean that all right let's watch paragraph 20 now don't you see that great picture we and flesh are different absolutely we have Jun and I have total different DNA because we come from two different families but now remember we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are Sons and Daughters not some other spirit amen but the spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become Sons and Daughters not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person joined wedlock to the Eternal right amen see how God planned it that we should be not a different but him that's right not some other being of some other tribe but a real Union and offspring of the almighty Glory done by a holy Union not a sex Union but a holy Union not the body comes from mother and father but the spirit comes from God God separating himself as Adam was separated on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separating itself and setting upon each member of that church God putting himself together amen we were separated in a garden he couldn't say she's born oh oh sure he knew we were born of his born of Flesh of his flesh but there's no way we could coincide with that there's no way we could come without here the new birth is what changes us amen right right Paul said follow me in the Regeneration what does regeneration mean mean reged you're not the son of Charles andell Branham or Samuel Peggy Dale you're being reged and then the scripture says we'll have a body like his glorious body brother R said we changed in the atoms guess what we're going to people we're going to have the same DNA Christ had thank you Lord on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separating itself and setting upon each member of the church God put God putting himself together then with that group of people together what does it do brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus coming together and today in this great separation that we're living in denominational differences in this message and things what a Pity what a disgrace joined in Heavenly wedlock to the Eternal God part of him part of God in flesh I become brandom because of my father brandom you become part of your father and mother but in spirit we become in Union with God is part of God that's the reason that the spirit cannot die he the believeth on me as everlasting life and in the image that he is here on Earth and in his likeness I'll raise him up in the last days not a spirit being for we'll have a body like God's glorious body the glorified body of the Lord Jesus raised up in that image right amen right sure God took a picture of it 20 years old but it was his genetics he was looking at right not your genetics of your mom and daddy right is that what he just said and if we're going to be if for we'll have a body to light God's glorious body the glorified body of the Lord Jesus raised up in that image sure we're going to look the same this is what God like cuz this is what he made but that image is going to be it's not going to be to me I say it won't be an image it'll be him made manifest in another form exactly cuz Eve was Adam made manifest in another form amen she said had the same body he had so if we don't have the same body that's why Paul says be conformed to the image being transformed by the renewing of his mind that's what that's what my dad said last night he said he said we got a long way to go Amen to get to that place right amen but God can do it in a hurry right amen cuz if you pull it out God will bring it right now look Let's do let's go to the last one let's let's skip the church ages let's do this we got communion today we had a chance to take communion in a couple of churches and that was that was really a treat so but we miss it here in our family spiritual Amnesia 1964 this is the last quote but we're going to read a little bit so bear with me now to be a true Christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him I'm identified with him notice and he is in me and I in him notice then every Christian that's a real genuine genuine Christian Christian was with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed right I was back there with him if I got eternal life that's what the people don't like that word if he said if you got eternal life that eternal life always was eternal not the you not you but that eternal life we got to be identified with that if I got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him when the morning Stars s together and the sons of God shouted for Joy I was with with him when he called Abraham right MDC brother Brown said every son of the faith going to take the same Journey as Abraham we got to meet MDC amen you say meet your own theophany you got to meet God Amen and if you stay on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that means God's Not In You Hallelujah I was with him when he called Abraham at the age of 75 and his wife 65 and told him they were going to have a baby I was with him when he took his stand upon thus sayeth the Lord I'm going to have the baby I stood with him every other Christian stood with him I was with him when his Temptations come it ain't all the good parts I was with him when he went up on top of the mountain to offer Isaac I was with him when the ram appeared I was with Joseph when he was rejected of his brothers cuz he was spiritual and the rest of them was carnal I was with him when he know the reproach he had to stand by his own Brothers what he was I am what I am he was for we all one in Christ Jesus I was with Joseph in his cave grave I was with him when he went to the right hand of pharaoh you had to be identified with him I was with Jacob that night when he wrestled all night with the angel I've wrestled myself I know what went through with have you if you're not then you're not identified with him right so I wrestled with Jacob the same time he did for I am his brother I was with Moses when he went down into Egypt I was Moses at the burning bush if you're a Christian you're identified within Bible characters don't forget it I was with Moses when all the people turned against him I was with Moses when he crossed the Red Sea when he raised his hand walked forward and the Red Sea opened I was identified in Christ right then and I was with Moses at that hour what every Christian has been what every believer has been every believer now is identified with that same person whatever it is you must be identified don't forget that when you do you've got spiritual Amnesia you've forgotten who you are right now identified with him with Moses when he crossed the sea I was with Elijah in the days of Ahab when they had to make a choice when they who they would serve God or baam was with him on Mount carel when he had to make a choice for we identified in the body of the same God that he was identified in so if we're identified in that body then we must we must remember we were there with him right now I was with David when he was rejected by his own Brethren I was with David you were too if you're a Christian you have to be identified in his rejection I was with the Hebrew children in a fiery furnace when the fire didn't burn them because of the presence of the fourth man I was with Daniel in the Lion's Den I was identified in there when the angel of the Lord identified him in there I was most certainly surely with him at Calvary I must be identified with him at Calvary I must be there to place that where not also was I identified with him at Calvary I died with him at Calvary every Christian must die with him at Calvary if you don't die with him at Calvary you can't be none of his I was there when he died I died with him and then when I was with him then I was with him when he raised up from the dead I came up on Easter morning with him in the resurrection whatever he did I was right there with him ever believer was the same and now I'm seated with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with all the powers of hell conquered through him every Christian believer was seated the same way cuz you have to be identified now I find myself in this last days with many of the believing Christians identified in his ministry he's the same yesterday today and forever I find myself in this day identified in his ministry do you find yourself that way believe it walking with it notice the works that he did he said the believer would do the same The Works that I do shall you do also then can you be identified with him then when the reproach comes on the word Can You Stand The reproach like he did say identified with him I was identified with him I was with him at the day of Pentecost I was with the disciples up there identified with them in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we must be with the disciples at Pentecost identified with them I was identified with Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2 2 chapter I heard what he said amen amen that's right I heard what he said didn't you I heard what he said I believe what he said I obeyed what he said now I'm identified in the same thing sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen my last statement is look the word Quicken now not just the word you can have the word every day of your life and and be just like cus cus had the word right but the word quick and refreshes our memory that's right amen let me say that one more time the word quickened refreshes our memory right so I was with David uh we were talking this morning about um patience and things like that you got to be identified that's not that's some people just have regular patience but that's Godly patience those virtues are Godly virtues there's something that God put in you it's not something that you know I was telling them that we we have a u a family that that's around home there that's that's identified with fighting and being rough and and and their name I'm not going to call their name but uh everybody knows when you say the name blank It's associated with fighting well see that's that's a characteristic that came down through in the people now the new birth will take care of that right but you're still going to fight that probably worse than some other people fights it because you got that nature in you that works against you but the word Quicken refreshes our memory and brings us back to where we have Godly patience not just the patience of man is what my point is not just the patience of man not the temperance of man but the temperance of God right the patience of God God had enough patience with you didn't he then why don't we have enough patience with others God had enough patience with you that little saying I've got in the back of my Bible God never ask you why you came or how long it took you to came to come he just say enter into the joy of the Lord he's not going to fuss about it took you 20 years to get here that's right and you're not going to be setting higher than the guy that got here 5 years ago you know we all going to be equal so God's not going to ask that he's just going to say enter into the joy of the Lord before the foundation of the world but I was thinking about what daddy said this morning he said that um that we that the prophet only has thus sayith the Lord and that's true but you know what we have the Book of Mark right says ask what you will amen that's right brother Bown never said thus sayth the Lord to sister uh MAA he never said thus sayth the Lord to uh to hady right he said you say right you say brother brandham what are you hunting hunting squirrels he said speak he didn't say say thus sayith the Lord he said speak because it was the Lord speaking amen right it was the Lord doing the speaking so once our commission as a bride of Jesus Christ we should have thus sayith the Lord or sit still like I said we've got the prophet not just the Prophet William Brandon we've got the prophet amen we've got the prophet the big th the Big T the prophet see we got that and we can say that we can we know what thus sayth the Lord is that's right but we don't have to say thus sayith the Lord on the Bible says you say right what you say you call for your kids you call for the mountain to be moved you call for this you call for that let's stand you love the Lord that's why we need to Quicken word people because what it does it refreshes it brings our brings our memory back we brother B said and I read the quotes that we read before it in the uhu um the sermons we had before this let me see if I can find it real quick where he says Adam after the fall Adam's senses were darkened and that's what happened Adam's senses were darkened why were they darkened because they they're FL he got flu stopped up right amen magicians come on well we're going to take communion so Daddy get ready to to do the I want to see if I can find that quote real quick hang on just a second I'll find it next time but uh that's what it says I mean that's what he told that's what he says so right you lose your mind that's right brother dick we should lose our mind but see if we if we have our own human mind we'll lean to our own understanding we'll lean to the things of the world we'll lean to that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but once we get on the tree of life you know here's Paul saying transform by the renewing of your mind what that's what I said about the word quickens it refreshes or renews our memory that we can identify with David we can identify with all those people in the Old Testament definitely identify with the ones in the New Testament but you know what they all spoke of right here right they want to be identified with you actually right they want to be known as we're known that we're the last ones we stood in I said before um Satan went over into God's perfect Eden and messed it up now God's come over here into Satan's perfect Eden and messing him up right under Satan's nose the Bride of Jesus Jesus Christ will prevail I love you time to take communion enjoy the message amen but I believe it don't you you know we can lean on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we need to get off of it and climb up on the tree of life and not lean on am then we can be all right can we amen tell our brother how much you appreciate the message because we believe it remember brother forny be with us wday pray the Lord would bless and guide each one okay let's go right into our scriptures in 1 Corinthians 11 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you for you this doing in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh un worthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged I love this scripture but when we are judged we are chasten to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat ter one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come communion is a great thing is it even so much until what the last message the prophet preached before his passing on was the communion because he wanted to leave us I guess the Lord did with something that would tie together with all of us and we could know about communion and what it is and what they call communion there Fellowship Fellowship with the Lord right that's communion right not just the bread and the wine that's that's good but Fellowship in in the word amen so what the Bible says that they car one for another let's just take a few moments and just have a silent prayer praying one for another you pray for me I pray for you we all pray that the Lord would bless us and keep us and guide us as we go about each day we thank you Lord for this day and your love unto us we thank you for the word that we've heard and now we thank you for an opportunity to be able to continue into that word that we find what that word is saying unto us and see that there's a communion to be taken and Lord we have the ability to understand how it is now of what it's to be not just some little grape juice and a soda cracker but yet to be set aside specifically for you Lord we love you and we thank you sanctify the partakers and Lord all of us together as one in you in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it was made for this purpose today and now we ask you to sanctify yes because lord it's in representation not in reality a representation of your body which was shed for each and every one of us we ask you to just sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name when it comes down to this part then we're supposed to be out of the way right this was in the upper room right this was not something that he would discuss with his disciples it was something that he told them he instituted and said all right now you do this you and we do it some have even gotten so that are so spiritual until they quit taking communion because they believe the Lord was here but according to the scriptures we're to take the communion until he comes right well if he's here physically then we're in bad shape we know he's here SP spiritually through the opening of the word we thank God for that we heard him just now as he spoke to us to our brother as to the word being revealed but yet there will be a physical part of a coming that can take us out of here we believe that we thank you we were asking some last night I told him when we're out and in Colorado hunting that time and we couldn't find no place to go to church I said go on down to anything we can find but we couldn't find one in that town I said find a Catholic Church I ain't never been to mass but I'll go in and sit down and watch him I think the wait or somebody said would you would you have taken the the communion I said nope I wouldn't have done that but that have been a little too far father we thank you for this wine that's made for this purpose today and Lord we know that it represents your blood which was shed for each and every one of us because a life Lord F flowing through the blood we love you and we thank you sanctify the wine and the partakers make us all together as one in you in Jesus name amen come morning our by the river I'll rest need the Ever Green Tree I'll carry he my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long did I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on right come morning I walk by the river our rest need the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight Come Morning D's glory for me amen do you believe that and brother Joe had somebody to to up his kind of a little testimony about his experience there with the snow and being having to spend the night in the truck and everybody bringing him food and things he has some copies of it if you want to read it I read it I very well enjoyed it you know because it's it shows that like he said there are still some good people left in the world you know that's that's there and and they're willing to get out and help and do things you know and bringing him chicken said he brought him the kind that he liked that he likes dark meat and they they must have known that you know I don't know whether he had a sign up in the window that says if you bring me Kentucky Fried make it dark meat but he got his dark meat cuz that's what he said it he he did but if you want to read it he has some testimonies are made of it so we we appreciate it brother Joe also gave me a copy of a a little something that if he would if he could run off a good many of them and just let everybody have it and it it was something that was found they said in brother bram's belongings and it's really good I'd appreciate it you know you reading it I really enjoyed it so he's got he can make us some copies of it and uh everything it's bringing out some wonderful words written by someone I think on back good time before but yet it was found there brother Bob had a pretty good testimony too he got to walk for 4 and 1/2 miles he said it was good said he enjoyed being out in a little stroll 4 and a half mile stroll it was good amen let's all partake together you can be seated while we get ready for the foot washing you know we come down to the time of the foot washing and we think about it and a lot of people you know they won't don't maybe don't want to partake of it but that's all right but it's it's a great thing for me but I do remember in the scripture there that you're not even to receive a sister into the body without her being you know having washed the Saints feet now not the men you know but women wash the women's feet the men wash the men's feet but it is a great thing to to partake of and I I appreciate it and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his carrot Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rised from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord do thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter Sith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus Sith unto him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean therefore he so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant and is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's all stand and we'll be dismissed and we'll tell you kind of a funny thing one time we had a problem here that we had some sisters that they didn't want to take off their hose and uh you know they wanted to have foot washing with their hoses on or what you call them you know panty hoses or what you call all that stuff and someone said something to me about it and I said you just tell them and I come right here and I said look we we we have foot washing we don't have clothes washing if you need any clothes wash them bring and I take them home my wife and put them in the washing machine right you know so but we did have that I never didn't know how all that turned out but cuz I'm not interested in that part of it but that is a point right father we thank you and we ask you to just be with us and bless us as we go on into the furtherment of the service now and how the foot washing Lord and then just be with each and every one of us on the way home give everybody a safe journey we believe you we heard the word today and in your word we've read it says that he would you would send your word and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction so then whatever we have need of is already taken care of we'll just hear your word and say thank you for it we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen you're dismissed
