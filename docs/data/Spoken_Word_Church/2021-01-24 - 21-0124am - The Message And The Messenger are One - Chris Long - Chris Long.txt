========================================

[Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] pour out your power [Music] i am [Music] lord [Music] you are holy [Music] amen we can see him this morning if we'll just open our spiritual eyes to his word you know a lot of folks i believe in the day that we live in that portray or call themselves christians don't really know what a christian is because they don't really know who christ is christ is the anointed word jesus himself when he was here was the word made flesh and that's where a lot of people misunderstand the lord sending himself in the form of his son is that he was vindicating his own word exactly which is what he's asking us to do today amen as fellow heirs sons and daughters of god god bless you it's a privilege as always to be in the house of the lord with you and to be here to minister and fellowship with you i do not have to introduce myself you all should know me by now i'll pray for the brother that's going to get eye surgery because i got eye surgery i did in december the 18th and they put a third eye right there on my forehead when they were taking out the stitches so you just pray for me that god will let that heal up and it's in its due time uh the rest of my eyes are doing well i can see so much better that now i don't have to use the 2.0 cheater glasses now i'm down to 1.5 amen i brought him with me just in case so while you're standing if you would i gave brother wade he come in the office and said give me a title and i said good luck matter of fact i thought of five or six of them after you left i've been preaching at home on the third pool now i haven't been approaching it the way that i would have years ago i've been taking a different approach to it because the lord had spoke to me and said break it down so it doesn't seem mysterious doesn't seem something that's not attainable uh and and and the phrases that we use today uh quoting out of the message a lot of people are like oh no we can't handle that we just brother wade and i were talking no we don't preach on the seven seals well i do as brother samuel pointed out to me if the prophet spoke it it was for a reason but a lot of people are missing the reasons why he said it so that's what i want to preach on this morning i did give the message a title brother wade give me the title the end time message and i liked it so much i said the message the message and the messenger are one do you believe that then if you believe the message you are in fact a messenger so you must become one with it so let's take saint luke chapter 14 if you would this morning uh it says there uh at verse 16 when you get it parable this is in the scofield bible above the 16th verse it says the parable of the great supper all right so let's just see how this works verse 16 says then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many let's pray father we thank you lord for this portion of scripture that we're going to read this morning lord for the sake of time father we'll just start right here we're asking lord that you'd come down father and remove each one of us out of our places lord and let the holy spirit become the filter that's in us father that we can receive exactly the way that you ordained it to be received lord it's a parable to many father but you told the disciples when they asked about speaking in parables that it would be revealed to them because they were chosen and elected father they were ordained and they were predestinated and they were foreseen by you lord and i believe that's why we're here this morning bless us and help us father move me out of the way for your honor and your glory in jesus christ's name we ask it amen god bless you may be seated i hope this is going to be all right for you this morning but i'm going to charge right into it because i i preach at home in this in you know in a series a pastor can do that he can he can take a subject and he can go for for for days or weeks or months on it and and he doesn't have to give it but one title and he says part one and part two and part three and apartment he just keeps on parting it out right so i i i felt compelled as i was uh uh uh preaching on on the pool and i've given different uh segmented titles to it but um we know that that in the bible for as an example um to help you kind of get to where my thoughts are and for example for an example moses the great prophet moses had uh uh three pools now when we go into the scripture and we begin to look at moses's pulls we we begin to realize that if you will read your bible that he had the uh the the the the staff and he threw it down right and it turned into a serpent and then he and now moses didn't like snakes you could tell by reading in the bible he ran from it and then then of course the lord instructed him don't worry about it uh i'm going to give you what it takes to overcome being afraid of that serpent so he picks it up and we know it turns back into his staff and then and then the second pool was him taking his hand and putting it in his bosom and and then in a clean hand put it in pull it out it's got leprosy on it and put it back in and then it it's fine again now we can follow that those pools through uh the the life and and the ministry of our own profit we understand that um but then there that came down to this this phrase uh the third pull or the third segment or the or the third part uh of the ministry and of course um if you'll go back in the exodus for the sake of time i'm not going to go there but you'll find out that moses had a third poll but he never used it you can read that in your bible all right he never had to use it it was and there was a reason for it i i believe that when god put something in his word now it has a use and he's going to use it but what happens is as we begin to focus on the messenger that god would send and we lose track of the message because of the signs wonders and miracles or the pulls of that messenger's ministry they become so spectacular because of course it's not the man and truthfully i want to be very truthful with you on the way that i god has dealt with me i have come to the conclusion that this is not the message of william mary and branham no more than in exodus it was the message of moses it was god using the man and then the men to be able to uh convey himself through them right now i know you understand that i know i'm preaching to the choir this morning so y'all stand up and sing for me amen will do amen all right yeah man you know what brother branham said amen was that was like telling the dog to sick him amen and i'm very comfortable here behind brother samuel's pulpit and i appreciate his confidence in me to allow me to come and my friendship and love for for for brother wade and and sister june and and uh we're just we really enjoy ourselves so i want you to relax but i don't want you to fall asleep amen i want you i want you to have your hearts open because what i'm going to bring to you is not mysterious but but uh it's it's months worth of of of of work uh in just an hour or two you'd be real proud of me brother samuel last sunday or two sundays ago i think was last sunday i preached two hours now i hardly ever ever do that usually i'm 45 minutes to an hour and i can see the folks back here going what is it today well let me start out like this now i i want to go through some of the scriptures and i chose saint luke 14 and then matthew 22 you see in saint luke 14 it's called the parable of the great supper so let's roll down a little ways into it before i get to the the to the definition of pull okay uh all right well you don't have to hold your bible anymore because you can look at the screen but i'll use mine because i got footnotes i have comments i got highlights are you ready so then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at suppertime to say to them that were bitten come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him i bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it now i want to stop right there for a minute and i want to i want you to get that gist of of of how this is going to work now think about this here is a person who has been invited uh the word bidden has has many different uh uh meanings to it but here's one where where the the the the bible uses it is bad and bidden it's an invitation all right it's a request it's an offer it also can be a little bit more intense in that it also can become a beseechment or an entreatment that's a little more intense than an offer you know an offer is when you get something in the mail and they're asking you to become a a player or a partaker of of what the the the invitation that they sent you but when the salesman that works for that company shows up at the front door it gets a little more intense you see what i'm saying so there was an offer made a request uh uh uh it seemed almost casual but the importance of the invent of the event is what should make it more uh uh you know a decision has to be made when you get an invitation to go down to hear a sales pitch if you're not interested in the product or you don't want to well that's one thing but here is a an invitation uh by by somebody of of high priority now now i i want you to notice something it doesn't it doesn't really identify and break down who this man is it just says a certain man right now if you didn't know who this man was you might throw the invitation in the trash but if you had some prior uh knowledge of who this certain man was you might think oh this is an up important man in our community or or this is an important man down where i bank at or this is important man where i work you see it gets a little more personal but right here it seems very impersonal just a certain man all right so that means that maybe he wasn't as well known as he could have been maybe he just arrived in the community and he wanted to invite everybody in the community over to his house so that he could get to know them and they could get to know him now there's a reason why i'm taking the long way around right now is that because you need to see this in order for you to get one with the message it's easy to come to a relationship or understanding with the messenger but what he's conveying has a lot to do with the fancy t-shirt that brother samuel had on yesterday you see he'll wear it one of these days and you'll get to read what was on it but i'll quote the man that everybody uh uh i say it like this because it's very similar to a quote that the that the actor john wayne made one of the many things that he made famous he said i can't help it if you don't understand what i said [Laughter] all right and and and god says things through a a message that he conveys through a messenger but the understanding also has to be sent down by god in order for you to come to an understanding of what's being said now we know that's that's the message of matthew 16 where where he asks who do men say i the son of man am and there was lots of answers and i if you really understand god's word none of those answers were exactly wrong [Laughter] because each messenger and each prophet that god would send was essential an essential part of the whole but he wanted to know if peter knew the whole who do men say i the son of man am well some say you're prophet some say this and some say that some say you're a good man some say you're a bad man and some say you're a crazy man and some say you're a good preacher and some down and down and down and down and he said that's all fine and dandy but i want to know who you personally peter i want to know who you personally think i am and he didn't have to think he said thou art the christ the son of the living god and we understand that peter was blessed by that statement but then what jesus said after that it became controversial you understand he said because upon this rock well there's there's there's a faction of of of of christianity that believes that the church was going to be built on peter now that started with the roman catholic church they made peter the first pope which is really interesting because peter was married and we and we and we have no record historically or any kind in the scripture that peter ever made it to even rome but they put him there they removed his wife and made him a pope because of the statement that peter made but then the protestant or protestant churches that that that that broke away from the roman catholic church and and the fact that they they believed that the foundation of the church was built on peter said no no that's not what he meant see how now now now dissension has started now now confusion has begun why because now you've got two sides and and they begin to argue and and disagree and split up and split apart about where the church who's who's it built on because the protestants believe no no no he he's it's built on him jesus the christ you see and both sides are wrong amen did you know that right it's not built upon peter and it's not built upon christ the reason we know that is they threw christ out he was the funny-looking stone that was the head of the corner and they didn't use him so they didn't build the church on him but the church is built on the revelation that god gives you of who he is so therefore we're relying on god this morning i can't rely on myself if i was to rely on myself i might have another stone that the church was built on maybe if i was a certain kind of a man i would think it was built on me but i don't think that way god has given me uh i would use the word punishment but i don't believe that's really the way it should be taken i believe god has given me lots of tests we know in the bible it says that god tempted job but the prophet of god said that's not exactly the way it works he didn't tempt job he tested him well you're looking at a man who's been tested all his life now i have failed a lot of those tests but my failures have worked to the good because i believe his word i believe he's in control i believe he he he's the master of everything the world's in chaos right now are countries in chaos right now god stealing control you say well why is it such a mess it's such a mess because god decided that man asked if he could have control of it and god said i'll give you control of it it ain't gonna work out god already warned him i'm telling you this isn't gonna work but if you want it i'll let you have it for a time and boy what a mess we have made so brothers and sisters i'll look at myself i'll cut the country out right now look at myself and say if i was decided that i was going to take over i'd be a mess so let go and let god that's the key amen so here we have a uh a a parable that begins in a certain way and uh and and the and and and what it says here in the scripture we'll go back to it uh and they all with one consent think about it this entire group of people that were made and offered to or given an invitation to and were bitten not one of them decided to take up the invitation because they began to make excuses and the first one said unto him i bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it now i do know that in this building this morning and those if some of you out there on the stream are business people what business man buys a piece of ground he ain't seen yet well i i got some i got some desert i'll sell you in florida yeah and i got some beach land i'll say in arizona well if you don't go look if you don't inquire if you're not interested enough and checking it out so i i want you to see how lame these excuses are all right i mean anybody could see right through them yet they're going to use them anyway bought me a piece of ground and i got to go check it out well first thing i think is what a lousy businessman he is right i pray thee have me excused in another verse 19. i bought a me a yoke of oxen and i go to prove them who's going to buy something a horse a a mule a cow an ox without proving it well they could all be lame and blind and halt and not any good at all maybe so old and sway back you couldn't even cut it up and eat it look at look at what's going on excuses are being made right now and the excuses are so poor and so lame yep right and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come i'm surprised the scripture doesn't say but i ain't better yet because that's really the kind of excuses that these folks make right when god sends a servant you're with me now i realize that we're we're we're made up differently here this morning but let's continue so that servant came and showed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind and the servant said lord it has done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be full now you may not have paid attention like i have but in this parable the word servant was used three times so we had a first pull and a second pull and a third pole now the third pull was for this servant to go out into the highways look at what the second pool was right healing get the halt the maim and the blind and everybody but how did they make it there right they must have gotten the satisfaction of the of of what the servant had from that certain man that they could walk and they could see you understand that's the second pull what's healing right by the discernment we understand that right and i want to you can cover this for days but we just want to get right down to the nitty-gritty for us this morning amen so then that third time the servant went out lord it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room amen and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled now what i want you to begin to see is the way god operates he does not operate the way you and i think he should operate he does not operate the way that that we operate he is god he doesn't make any mistakes but the really interesting thing about the god we serve is he deals in parables why well uh i didn't put it down in my notes but we could go over to matthew 13 and we could find out why is that right i'm sorry brothers that i didn't give you that scripture but i know you could get it as quick as possible matthew 13 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables right who is them well them is who they certain man bade or invited to his great supper he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given you see they didn't have inside information to know how important this invitation was going to be all they saw was a certain man that certain man in our day traveled around this planet seven times amen and he was just a certain man to most people think about it in the days of jesus who was god manifest in the flesh as the son of god only one tenth of one percent of the population knew who the son of god was you'd say no man everybody must have no no no they didn't have social media back then they didn't have a way to share the good the bad and the ugly to everybody on the planet it was just whoever god called to come in contact so even the disciples who came in contact wanted to know how come lord you're talking so funny why are things hidden why are there mysteries what about these things that are said that we don't understand well it'll be given to you he said that's right for an understanding when you have need of he's still with me this morning amen all right let me go back over to the parable i want you to see something before i move forward this word compel down in verse 23. and compel them to come in that my house may be filled the word compel is to drive or urge forcefully or irresistibly right okay yeah all right so either you're going to be forced or it becomes so irresistible that you arrive compel means to cause to do or occur by overwhelming pressure you don't think the squeeze is numb well the squeeze has been on me ever since i come to the lord 42 years ago but now it's to the highways and the hedges it's to anybody who will listen that you can get to come but i want you to see something here in this parable this is the great supper well wait a minute matthew 22 calls it the parable of the marriage feast so is it the great supper or is it the marriage feast well brothers and sisters when it comes right down to it it would become one in the same by revelation but without the revelation one is the great supper and it's just a servant [Laughter] but when those who actually end up showing up by being bitten by being preached to by being compelled and urged to be driven and some of us unfortunately have to be driven is that right because if we're not i'll tell you what the prophet of god said in now i i better read it off the cover because i say sirs what time is it that's not what it's called now is this the sign of the end sir in that message brother branham begins to talk about and i even told the brothers i wasn't reading no quotes but sorry and and those brothers are so quick on the draw back there i'm sure they can get this uh in is this the sign of the end sir paragraph 129. brother branham talking about a dream a brother had his brother jackson and brother branham says and telling the dream and brother jackson said then you picked up something like from the air how you getting it this morning how you been getting it through the air if you understand what we're talking about brother branham broke it down to airwaves and he says you've got to have a crystal inside of you i knew they could do it you got to have a certain thing inside of you to become a receiver of what's being passed through the air now you say well he's talking about a radio oh it's a parable you see some people just hear radio waves but to those like in matthew 13 that it was given to it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom how do we know and my neighbor don't know it's how you receive what's coming through the air so in this dream brother branham picked up something like from the air like something like a wrecking bar don't tell me that this is not the house of you corrections it brother sometimes the preacher be preaching and you're like oh he's beating me to death with a wrecking bar or a crowbar that's even better why because what kept the voice of elijah alive [Laughter] black birds crows you with me ravens they're all same relation if you don't know that he and brother brad says wasn't it brother something like that a wrecking bar real sharp so you got to have yourself studied and approved in order to be able to be used by god to bring something that will cut even to the morrow because it's a sharp two-edged sword and it'll discern what's going on in your life it'll it's so good the word of god is so good that it'll discern what you're going to do tomorrow yeah right that's right and the next day and the next day and what you did last week and the day before that that's how the word of god works that's why you'll say oh brother i was just listening to a message and what you said or i was just reading in the scripture what you said and and i was just talking to a brother or sister about way and lo and behold if it didn't come out from the pulpit then tomorrow you'll run across somebody who will begin to talk to you about the very subject does that happen to you did you know that's the word of god it's working but watch this he says and you struck the top of that mountain and you ripped it around and lifted the cap of it off and it was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it off now that was months and months before the pyramid message was preached by the way that's the stature of a perfect man and said beneath that was white stone granite and you said the sun watch now or light has never shined on this before look in on this watch this now here is a place in the message where the prophet of god is conveying to the people through a dream that you need to pay attention to this well how could we pay attention to it if the sun or the light had never shined on it before because it was going to begin to shine on it from the time you started paying attention to it amen oh yeah that's right but if you make an excuse you'll never even get to the great supper which by revelation turns into the marriage feast and you'll see how it works before i'm done i'm watching the clock i probably shouldn't even do it thank you brother samuel and right because in the formation of the world paragraph 130 the world was formed before there was light we all know that god moved upon the water that's a type of the spirit then in the beginning he spoke for light and i've always liked to say and i may have said it here before the first thing that came from god was not light and god said it was the spoken word and god said let there be light the first thing that you could see with the natural eye was light but before the natural eye could see something came through the air [Laughter] here with me all right naturally down under there in the age that formation was and i'm going to say that that formation was i realize that it says it that that light had never come upon that stone amen what's a stone it's a revelation it's a confession it's a it's it's something that's revealed to you but light had never shine on it so i want you to get this inside of everybody in here this morning are things that you don't know yet amen but you let the light shine on it amen and you realize that when the light shines on those things that are inside of you today that you're not that you don't even know yet you'll see that it's a stone amen how did that stone got there who put that stone there well it was the creator because he made those stones but light hadn't shined on him yet so there was no writing there's nothing you can read how can you get it if you can't see it you still with me and he said look upon this the light has never come upon it before and brothers and sisters do you understand what's going on here don't focus on brother jackson's dream as much as what's being said you see how can you look upon something that light has never come on before it's it's darkness there's no way for you to see it unless god reveals it to you like he did peter in matthew 16. flesh and blood did not reveal this to you there was no light that shined on this up to the point of peter's statement you see i want you to get this brothers and sisters peter's statement was the light that shined upon the stone that never had light on it before you see that amen and a pond listen now upon this rock upon this stone what stone the fact that the father which is in heaven has revealed it unto you and that brings the light then you begin to see but these folks in the parable in luke 14 never allowed the light to shine upon what they did not understand therefore they began to make excuses and and in the day we live in brothers and sisters a lot of excuses are being made they're being made so radically and so drastically that people that have followed this message half or near all their life has said i can't see it anymore that's because you pulled up short and you and you and you disallowed the stone as the scripture says and now you can't see your blind laodicea [Music] amen rich have needham i don't need you that's what people are saying because i got my own thing going on here you understand and you couldn't preach to somebody something that they hadn't already heard but what happens with the preaching of the gospel is that lights come on you remember the old forgive me brother uh samuel because you work for chevrolet general motors but the old commercial with the ford ford has a better idea they said that blink and the little chain would pull and the little light bulb would come on well general motors probably already had them ideas didn't they brother said ford was just promoting it but i want you to understand that's really the way it works as we move forward as we move through as we move into a light comes on hasn't it happened to you haven't you been sitting in the pew all this time and a preacher whether it's one of the home boys or a visitor will come and say something in such a way and you go i see that i see a light came on so you see light never shone on that before but that stone was there all the time but it took something through the air amen so that the top of it could be taken off and you could look inside but here's what most people do most people do now if if i was to uh keep reading and i don't need to you can do it on your own we'll find out that people are like cattle that's what he says here in the next page or two they'll take the path of least resistance you know what i mean they won't pull they won't they won't shove the gate down but if the gates open they just get right hey there we go that's an easy one we'll just wander over there and we'll just wander over there and we'll just wander over there do you know why that people are like cattle according to brother branham very few stayed on to look on to what i had told them brothers and sisters don't give up don't pull short don't stop keep moving keep moving no matter how hard it gets no matter how rough it gets no matter how bad it looks listen now no matter how dark because the light is always with you and it will shine whenever you get to the i noticed this about the life of abraham god talked to abraham and everybody said what's the matter with you he never talked to me and abraham you've got the life of luxury here what do you think you're doing quitting your job and going out where yeah where are you going abraham couldn't tell because he hadn't gotten to the point of the next stone light hadn't shown he it light just shone on abraham take your stuff and go and i want you to notice something in the scriptures abraham wandered around kind of like what we would say pillar to post but when he got to the next destination that god wanted him at he didn't know he didn't know what the next destination was but when he got to the place where god wanted him through all his wandering light shone on a stone that had not been written on before in his life and god spoke to him again okay abraham you finally made it to the place where i wanted you to go god didn't tell him god didn't give him a map the only thing abraham knew was god spoke to me here and told me to go where but he told him to go and that's all abraham needed amen he went on that right he now i want you to know something about humanity abraham had no idea whether god would ever talk to him again or not and you know if god hadn't spoken to him again abraham would have said wow man i must be going crazy yeah yeah right i mean i must be going nuts because i know god talked to me but now he's left me all alone oh no he hasn't left you alone just don't be like these cattle when the prophet of god says something take it to the bank because it's god speaking through him and these folks in luke 14 had no idea who this man was just like we had no idea who the man was that was talking to us until we gave our heart to him i can look back now in my own testimony and look in my life and i didn't give my heart to the lord till i was near 22 years old but now i can look back in my past before i give my heart and said oh god was dealing with me god was steering me around abraham didn't realize it but god was turning him abraham would begin to wander over here and that didn't work out so he'd have to wander over here and that didn't work out and he'd have to wander over and finally he got to a place where it looked like he'd had a little grass and some water and god said okay i'll talk to you again but that wasn't his stopping point you see abraham wandered around looking for a city whose builder and maker right was not man i want to clue you in on something this morning i want to shine a little light on that stone do you know that abraham was looking for you and me that's who he was looking for he was looking for a city whose builder and maker was not man and brothers and sisters if you're in the mystical body of christ this morning you did not get there by your own hands because i'll take you to a place in the old testament where he told one of his servants to build an altar he said but don't you unhewn stones those stones should not be handled by man's hands build me that altar amen abraham was looking for us and here we are amen a portion of that city whose builder and maker is not man amen so the whole point of this is in paragraph 133 they were looking in on it in 132 brother jackson out of the corner of his eye said he kept one eye on the prophet and he slipped off to one side the prophet did and started going towards the west towards the setting of the sun coming up a hill going down a hill coming up a hill going down a hill getting smaller and smaller and went all the way out of sight what was the coming up the hill and going down the hill and coming up the hill and going down do you know those were pools because the prophet of god said his ministry was like that mountain range that he had he come across up there somewhere on the wyoming montana border in that direction seven peaks three of them were taller than the others up a hill down a hill up a hill down a hill but if you'll notice the last peak the third pull was the highest peak but he got smaller and smaller until he went all the way out of sight that's right here we are today we realize who he is who he was who god sent amen but he's not our christ he's not our god you understand we know that but there are people who are making him way more missing the mark by a long shot they either says nothing or they say he's too much but the true revelation is to understand how he placed himself in the word of god he said i must decrease so that he who christ can increase he's still with me amen all right so down at the paragraph 133 if the brother still got it up there then he said when i did that he said then the brethren turned around after a while now watch he's out of sight he's not here he can't talk for himself he can't straighten out what people are saying about him and he can't live the life anymore in front of the people so they'll know who he is he's out of sight right and when that happened the brethren turned around after a while and said did he vanish where did he go and said some took out that way some took one way some another you see they're all going off on their own like like i know i got a piece of land yeah see what i'm saying i gotta go check it out no i bought some ox hey i married a wife i'll see you all later but a very few stayed and looked on to what i had told amen them now let's go back over to the parable saint luke 14 23 and 24 and the lord said unto the servant go into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in that my house watch may be filled right now watch this last statement for i say unto you that none oh that's harsh now that hurts but none of those men which were bidden the word bidden now remember is to drive or urge forcefully none of them saw it as irresistible forbidden shall taste of my supper amen so right here is judgment amen he's still with me matthew 22. let's go over to matthew 22 and let's see what now this now we realize that we serve the god of his word amen is that right there's no contradiction now if you believe that i'll pray for you but there's no contradiction in god's word what man does is he begins to use his own reasoning and begin to try to apply that reasoning most of the time because of your own situation your own condition your own circumstances it's as simple as water baptism now here we've got jesus telling them to go into all the world and baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost not fathers not names not sons you understand but in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and then the man that was given the keys to the kingdom by revelation by a statement of revelation that god gave to him over in the book of acts begins to employ exactly what the lord said in matthew 16 or mark 16. thank you and they were all baptized in the new testament in the name of the lord jesus or jesus christ and the lord it's the lord jesus christ in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost people are still arguing about it and watch watch the cop out oh it don't matter how we're baptized none of those were bitten no that's right because it did not matter to them how it was done they bought land and didn't check it out they bought oxen they didn't prove it and a guy married a wife and i don't even know if he ever saw her well to go along with the rest of the parable you understand she must have been veiled it didn't matter he just wanted to get married now brother branham cautions all you young folks that aren't married yet you pray about it you make sure and this is another thing he says don't marry outside of what you believe happens all the time but don't marry outside of what you believe and i understand the hope yeah it's well they'll come in why don't you lead them in and then if god wants you together then it would be according to the word because if you don't do it according to the word it more than likely will fail if you do it according to the word you're going to be tested and proven but if it's according to god it'll come out in the end you're with me amen so you got you got matthew 22 now this to me is interesting this is matthew the other parable's scribe was luke now luke was a doctor you're with me and they have a specific way of doing things and they see things a certain way and it's their way or the highway very few of them are open forgive me if there's a doctor in here to to to alternatives because they're using their their skill their knowledge uh what they've seen in the past to begin to deal with what's in front of them but matthew worked for the irs [Laughter] now can i ask you a question who is the harder case luke or matthew matthew was a mathematician he was a numbers cruncher he was the guy that decided through calculation how much tax you owed he understood numbers look at the parable it's supposedly the same parable you with me but it's not given the same title luke 14 the marriage feast what do we got here i mean the great supper what we got here is the parable of the marriage feast something has happened what happened light began to shine on this you see that servant in luke 14 was sent out to just get anybody i don't care whether they're sinner or saint i don't care whether they're the trash man whether they're the drug addict whether they're the drunkard whether they're the president i don't care who they are you just speak so that they'll hear and come that my supper will be filled that's a very general way of doing things that's why god sent a prophet amen what you need to see is he sent that servant to compel to urge to bid to offer to request to entreat to invite here we are this morning but that just gets you to the great supper i'm going to tell you folks something right now i got the great supper right here amen hang on let me just here's the great supper right here the message of your hour yes sir if if we lived uh 3 500 years ago i'll have to look in my bible in the days of moses these would have been these would have been printed sure and it would have said moses instead of william branham on the bottom 2000 years ago would have said paul this says jesus from cover to cover you with me but brothers and sisters this is just the great supper if you showed up the marriage feast amen comes by revelation amen amen amen same books same recordings same writings but different feast elevated more specific the great supper is very is it is very general but the marriage feast is specific yes sir you see how matthew by revelation is narrowing it down there's nothing wrong with the parable in luke 14. there's nothing wrong with dr luke but matthew by the grace of god in this instance was given some light that luke didn't have he didn't call it the great supper he called it the marriage feast and look at the other differences would you with me and then we'll close matthew 22 verse 1 and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king oh it's a little elevated now and 14 it was a certain man but now it's somebody important pay attention now it doesn't say the king of kings it says a king now let me ask you a question brothers and sisters who are the kings of the king amen i'm looking at him this morning amen kings of the king amen you're with me so this parable doesn't pinpoint whether it's the king or a king it just says a certain king which made a marriage for his son oh it's getting a lot more specific you see if the folks in luke 14 had known it was a king and that it was going to be the marriage feast they might have come chances are no because at the end of the scripture none of those that were bitten right they got an invitation but they turned it down watch verse 3 this is the reason why i'll just be public about it the fivefold ministry is under attack today listen careful by those who received a servant that's right amen and sent forth his servants what happened what happened to the parable it's the same god saying the same words to two different men one of the men recognizes that a servant has servants and he sent that servant three times in luke 14. but i'm gonna i'm gonna throw this at you i want you to mull and chew on this but was the third time the servant in luke 14 him or his servants oh it doesn't say servants brother that's right the message and the messenger are one do you believe the message this morning if you believe the message this morning then you will become one with it and when you become one with that message you become one with that messenger and now it's not servant it's servants amen exactly so you now have become a messenger from god amen and you know what your message is to live what's been said that's what jesus message really was why do you condemn me he said for for a good no no no not for the good works but for you being a man who make yourself god that choked them do you know brothers and sisters that that's what will choke the church world today is there there are here on this planet now people who are beginning to become the living word and it will begin to choke those who cannot see it manifesting in their life and they will become our condemners sir can we keep going i got a little bit of time and sent forth verse 3 his servants to call them that were bidden i want you to see this they were already bidden yes how do we know that luke 14. they were already invited they were all the offer was already made how is it made by the prophet amen by the message that the prophet left the invitation and the offer has been here but now the servants are going to be used to call them that's right so you get that look at it to call them that we're already bidding already invited already knew god sent a prophet right amen i already understood that in the bible behold i will send you elijah the prophet is that right now some of you folks may or may not know this but there's two parts to malachi 4 6 he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children you got that do you want to read it brothers can you put malachi 4 6 up there yeah i know i'm still using my bible i'm good with that 4 5 malachi 4 5 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and brothers and sisters can i ask you a serious question are we not on the threshold amen of a dreadful day now why would it be great look up your redemption draws nigh don't sweat what's going on in the political world and in the church world and in the west world in that world look up don't let your head hang down look up why because when this may be the darkest and most evil day that's ever been but it is the golden you may not realize it but this is the day that the lord hath made and it's the one that abraham was looking for that's why it's a great day but it's very dreadful especially for those who were bidden and wouldn't come and then they're told you ain't coming right none of those that were bitten that refused the first call can come but here we go watch this malachi 4 6 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse you don't find that interesting i do and here's what i've been told by many ministries brother branham only fulfilled half of that only the part that john the baptist fulfilled he only the message this is what people are conveying they've only turned the heart of the fathers to the children hear me now and so they have to because they only see half of that fulfilled they have to say he's coming back he's coming back because we believe he's the one and he didn't fulfill all that was said about him because he hasn't turned this is what they say the heart of the children to the fathers and i and and i've been confronted by it and i and i told the people i've got news for you too late the heart of this child has already been turned back to the pentecostal original i'm not talking about 1906 now i'm talking about 2 000 years ago when what happened a servant was sent to bid to them to come to the great feast and israel crucified him turned him down so he went out into the highways and the byways and the hedges and he collected some disciples now he had many followers when he was breaking the bread and the fish when the healing campaign was going on in his second pool he had lots of followers but when he said unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the son of man what kind of a statement is that it's a statement that light hadn't shined on yet he was beginning to un to cut off the top and show the disciples a stone that hadn't been written on yet why because they would become ridden epistles right right you shall become written epistles read of all men that's why those seven unknown thunders on the back of the book look like there's no writing amen but that same prophet said that in the last days the real true church amen would understand those seven he didn't call him thunders he said voices you're with me now they become a voice they're no longer a noise that you have to be afraid of that you have to cower down to that you don't understand they are becoming a voice to you you're with me how do we know that because over there in what saint john 12 i think it is is that the one where where it thundered and some said it was a prophet uh some say it was this and so angels is talking to him brother branham tells us that jesus understood what was being said so it was the voice of god to him see how important it is to sit in the house of the lord yeah it's saint john 12 i just wanted to check there in verse 28. you still with me brothers and sisters let me get let me let me find a place where we can pull off till this afternoon all right oh yeah it gets good for me it gets good so so here we are verse 3 and sent forth his servants to call them and remember many are called but few are chosen call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come and again he sent forth this is different now the other servant went out did didn't get the results that he wanted he he went to the to the the hefe to the one that sent him and told him well watch this second round he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold now there's a message coming with it he's given these servants a revelation to begin to preach you see what the other servant did not divulge he did not give it out he told the people you stay here and you look on this but most of the people left very few men and or women would stick around and say okay this must be prophecy this must be for the future this must be for something that's coming and then as it began to come guess what you found out you and me became the fulfillment of the prophecies that were said years ago that didn't make any sense to the people just like isaiah behold a virgin shalt come on come on behold the virgin that is not possible that's right except for one phrase all things are possible to those that believe you're with me and 700 or 800 years later 740 or whatever it was a young girl a young girl who the prophet of god tells us and spoken word is the original seed learned isaiah's statement on the knees of her mother exactly what is a mother it's your church and you're learning right now on the knees of your mother a statement that was made that could not be understood could not be scientifically proven could could not be handled by people for years now brother madam told us this that there were handfuls of women virgins because you had to qualify kind of like the ministry today you got to qualify now just because you qualify doesn't make you a minister called by god but you do have to be a virgin in order to be able to fulfill isaiah you're with me handfuls would begin to think could be me could be me could be me first date second age third age fourth age fifth age sixth stage and then we even got to the seventh age and the pentecostals believed that they reached the summit brother banham said no no no no no you're just getting started can you start with me today brothers and sisters do you realize that we're just getting started and you go i don't know brother it doesn't look like we have much time oh we don't need time because time shall be no more now the clock is still moving there's still three and a half years of tribulation there's still a thousand years of the money in the city you see the calendar's still working but for the bride when she starts she's done because brother branham said when god says anything no matter how many years it might take in god's thinking it's finished he doesn't look over his shoulder and check to see he let there be light oh where's that sun at i know that sun's going to come up oh get that cloud out of the way no no he just keeps moving like those four living creatures he just keeps moving forward right that's brothers and sisters the god we serve and that's the way we should be amen now how long have i been up here i'm asking for a good reason oh hour and 20 minutes somebody must be getting hungry wait a minute oh yeah no but i i i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna close here in a minute but i'm gonna start out with this out of blasphemous names brother branham at the end of the message says now one thing more i'll give you brothers these quotes i'm not going to read them he's talking about his two climaxes think about it two climaxes why didn't he say three climaxes because brother branham tried without the understanding forgive me if this offends you but he did not have the understanding of not being able to explain the third poll how do we know that because the angel said i told you not to try to explain it but he tried and he tried and he tried and i don't believe brother branham was was out in the open uh cognitively going against what the angel told him don't believe that for a second but i do believe brother branham misunderstood what the angel meant when he told him don't try to explain it why did he tell him that and then why did brother branham continue to try to tell people how it worked two reasons one the angel said don't do it because you can't you can't explain the third poll i won't be able to tell you the difference between the servant's first message in luke 14 and his last message in luke 14 that got some people in the house you're with me all right the first message didn't work yeah no i had rejected everybody all with one consent what did the why i can imagine back in those days come on man this guy hadn't even got an education yeah he didn't even go to school you see he he he's it's his hillbilly yeah there ain't no way oh he's got a gift but there ain't no way god called him to bring no important message he gets that's that those excuses were made by the even his own pastor dr roy davis said come on billy you huh think about it you you're gonna go out and you're gonna preach the kings and potates give me a break you don't even know your abcs well he did learn them always believe christ he learned his abcs whether you know it or not brothers and sisters algebra is not that difficult if you understand the theory of algebra without understanding it might as well be a foreign language that you never have seen before brothers and sisters i believe this is not a foreign language to us i believe we've seen these things before where brother i'm only so-and-so i i haven't been in the message i don't know the bible i don't know oh in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but you see god kept that to himself he didn't want light to shine on that yet so there was no writing and i'll tell you why there was no writing on it because he didn't want the enemy to get a hold of him you see what was on the back of the book is still inside the book but it's not written legibly in the book except written epistles you're becoming the fulfillment of what looks like the unwritten word how is that possible because light now is going to shine on what was in god's mind before the foundation of the world amen and i've already been attacked by this so i know the counter punch oh come on brother god sent a prophet and a prophet is the last moving part in the body and i can't disagree with that the mouth and the eyes he says the eyes it's the last moving part right ah but he says in another place there's one thing left the intelligence and whether you realize it or not the reason why we're being fought so hard be all by all the enemies including our own fallen nature is because the thoughts of god unseen thoughts are becoming by the light shining on them for the hour they're in written epistles red of all men now some men will read you and they will be condemned amen none of them which were bitten to the great supper but the marriage feast turns the corner and it's because now the revelation is not just on one man listen brothers and sisters if god wanted to keep all this to himself and do it all himself he would have remained elohim we would have remained thoughts inside of him and we and and there had to be some way of communicating come on now you all have a mind don't you does everybody in this room except for you sleeping is everybody in this room thinking of something either i'm a nut or whoa i never heard this before yeah the brothers preach on that all the time or you know whatever's going on in here i'm hungry and blasphemous names we're going to find out that the people got hungry and began to leave he wouldn't stick around long enough they wouldn't look upon those things that they didn't understand so their natural appetite began to take over and it's like okay man i can't take this anymore how did jesus fast for 40 days what was he living on if i fasted for four days i wouldn't be worth much unless i came in contact with the god who created all nature then he would take over down in the engine room and no matter how weak or how tempted or how tired how numb how hungry we could keep going did you know it's a great and dreadful day please stand i'll take off from there i can i can make this in two parts ease you love the lord amen did i did i pick up on somebody was getting hungry no no but it but but but in blasphemous names listen it didn't happen to the servants it happened to the servant yes sir amen he was preaching amen and people got tired now i'm gonna ask y'all a personal question i don't want you to raise your hand or answer it out loud but if brother samuel was to turn on a message of brother branham every sunday morning how many of you could stay awake but when god has a living servant which are servants get behind this sacred desk and then begin you're going to find out before we're done it's not a different message they preached the same message but god gave them things to say to the people that would begin to shine light that had never shined on that spot before yeah let's pray father help me lord because lord this message is real this message is for us lord and it's condensated down from you to a servant to servants lord and all of us in one way or another are servants lord here to serve here to serve others father as you served us we pray that you would help us with our revelation lord that you would help us to see father that we are part and partakers of this third pull father we've come to that place lord we've heard the phrase we know the term we can locate it father in the scriptures and in the message but father up to this point it has just been words on pages they've just been things that have been said by your servant lord i can see now unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the son of man you have no life in you that statement was made lord to shine light and to separate it is truly a great and dreadful day lord and we have arrived father and we believe lord that we're not children of darkness but children of light and we are the light as we walk in the light lord help your children to better understand your word lord which will help them better understand themselves and as they better understand themselves lord they'll begin to better understand the word we love you and we thank you we'll give you all the praise and the honor and the glory in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ and god's children said amen so be it amen god bless you i want to sing come and dine before br is that's that's all right brother joseph i just don't feel it it'd be right to just walk off without that it's in sea for me uh sisters brothers oh come and die master
