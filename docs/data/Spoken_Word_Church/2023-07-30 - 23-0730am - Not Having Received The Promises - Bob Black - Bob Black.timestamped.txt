[0:01] foreign
[0:06] way back wind we were studying in
[0:08] Hebrews 11 and just just kind of want to
[0:12] finish we got to the last the last verse
[0:14] in Hebrews 11 is they they without us
[0:16] cannot be made perfect
[0:18] and so wouldn't just kind of meditate on
[0:20] that scripture this morning and talk
[0:21] about some things
[0:23] pertaining to that let's just go to the
[0:25] Lord in prayer Lord God we're so
[0:26] grateful to be able to gather together
[0:28] this morning Lord and we ask Lord that
[0:29] you'll bless the study this morning as
[0:31] we study these things out Let It Be
[0:34] edifying to your people Lord Jesus be
[0:37] where brother wait as he's preparing the
[0:38] services today Lord God bless our
[0:41] service we pray in your name
[0:44] now verse 13 and 14 you know what I I
[0:48] it's I'm always struck at how
[0:49] encouraging Paul is as he's kind of
[0:52] laying these things down and he's kind
[0:53] of giving us the background of all these
[0:55] examples of the that as he says like a
[0:57] great cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 11
[0:59] that we can look to and be encouraged
[1:01] that they without without even many of
[1:04] them didn't even reach the promise to
[1:06] have been promised to them Abraham and
[1:08] Sarah and what we will look at as
[1:10] examples in a moment of how God gave
[1:13] them a promise that they ever never
[1:14] actually got to step into themselves
[1:17] but they were looking Abraham was
[1:18] looking for a city Abraham was looking
[1:20] for possession of the land and all these
[1:22] promises that they were given to and
[1:25] Paul is Paul is encouraging us
[1:27] as he moves on into Hebrews chapter 12
[1:29] don't stop running you you gotta you got
[1:32] to keep pressing on it there's it's like
[1:34] a race and you're racing to cross the
[1:35] finish line and you want to you want to
[1:38] keep persevering as though you're a an
[1:40] athlete in a race don't don't stop and
[1:42] just lay on the side of the road but
[1:44] there's a goal that you're trying to
[1:46] you're trying to get to
[1:47] now so in in verse verses 13 and 14 he
[1:51] said these all died in faith not having
[1:53] received the promises there's a promise
[1:55] that was laying there in front of them
[1:57] that didn't quite attain to but yet God
[1:59] told them he he he told them there
[2:01] Abraham there's a city that you're that
[2:03] you're looking for and Abraham walked
[2:05] like he was a uh in here in this verse
[2:08] they confessed that they were strangers
[2:10] and pilgrims on the Earth
[2:12] and it says having received the promises
[2:13] but having seen having seen them afar
[2:16] off and were persuaded them of them and
[2:18] embraced them and confessed that they
[2:19] were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
[2:21] so they were they were so convinced that
[2:24] uh that that that the goal was in front
[2:26] of them that they didn't waver that they
[2:28] didn't fall to the side they didn't give
[2:30] up they just kept pressing on and that's
[2:32] the kind of faith that Paul is trying to
[2:33] encourage every believer that reads this
[2:36] letter that to have that same kind of
[2:38] perseverance
[2:40] so it says these all died in faith now I
[2:42] haven't received the promises in verse
[2:44] 14 for they that say such things declare
[2:47] plainly that they seek a country and
[2:50] truly if they had been mindful of that
[2:52] country from which they came out they
[2:54] had might have had opportunity to have a
[2:56] return they they wasn't thinking about
[2:58] where they came out of they were their
[3:00] mind was on the go on the finish line
[3:04] like the story of Lot's wife her mind
[3:06] was on where she came out of and she was
[3:09] turned into salt but these people that
[3:11] in the great the Hall of Faith here in
[3:13] Hebrews 11 their mind was on where they
[3:15] were going to but now they desire a
[3:17] better country that is in Heavenly
[3:20] wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[3:22] called their God for he hath prepared
[3:24] for them a city
[3:26] oh
[3:29] and you think about in in verse 13 where
[3:32] it says these all died in faith not
[3:34] having received the promises that Sarah
[3:36] never lived to see her descendants
[3:38] become like the Sands of the sea she
[3:40] never saw that and Abraham never saw the
[3:43] nation of Israel return to the promised
[3:45] land
[3:46] and Abraham never saw New Jerusalem with
[3:48] his natural eyes
[3:50] and Abraham never saw the promise of the
[3:52] Seed of Abraham fulfilled in Christ
[3:54] and Abraham never saw the promise of the
[3:56] new birth
[3:57] there's a lot of promises that they
[4:00] didn't see so it was Paul's Point that
[4:02] he's as he goes over into Hebrews 12
[4:03] they they had a lot of promises laying
[4:05] in front of them that they didn't get to
[4:06] see but now you you get to take
[4:09] advantage of all these promises that
[4:11] were given to them
[4:12] you get to see the Fulfillment of that
[4:14] now that's what Paul means when he says
[4:16] in in Hebrews 12 verse 22 he says but ye
[4:19] are come unto Mount Zion what's Mount
[4:22] Zion Mount this this right here
[4:25] he or come unto the city of the Living
[4:28] God you'll come unto the like John saw
[4:31] the city coming down from God out of
[4:33] heaven like a door like a bride a dorm
[4:36] for her husband this you have come to
[4:38] actually God manifesting himself in a
[4:41] bride and living in you to fulfill what
[4:43] that New Jerusalem is going to be
[4:45] decorated like the Heavenly Jerusalem
[4:47] into an innumerable company of angels
[4:49] what's he saying that they were promised
[4:52] they were promised that one day God
[4:53] would pour His Spirit out on All Flesh
[4:55] and one one day you would be able to uh
[5:00] a Redemption of your body and all the
[5:03] promise of the promised land the
[5:05] Capstone that the old corn of the land
[5:07] all these things and now you have come
[5:09] to what they were could only look at in
[5:12] the future you've come to the general
[5:14] assembly in church of the firstborn
[5:16] which are written in heaven
[5:18] and to God the judge of all and to the
[5:20] spirits of just men made perfect you've
[5:23] been made perfect by and that's what
[5:25] we're going to look at in a moment
[5:26] perfection
[5:28] you've been made perfect by that promise
[5:30] being fulfilled in your life the promise
[5:32] of the Holy Ghost makes the believer
[5:34] perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the
[5:37] New Covenant into the blood of
[5:39] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[5:40] than that of Abel what's Paul doing he's
[5:43] exposing to the to the Hebrews that he's
[5:45] writing this letter to that all these
[5:46] things in the Old Testament that were
[5:48] prophesied of that were spoken of that
[5:50] were types of something now you have
[5:52] come to the Fulfillment of those types
[5:54] that all these things these types and
[5:57] shadows in the Old Testament were
[5:58] speaking of something that now you can
[6:00] have access to in the in the concrete
[6:03] reality of what those things were
[6:04] speaking of
[6:06] foreign
[6:07] and so they they were walking by faith
[6:10] walking toward these promises now in
[6:13] first John chapter 5 verse 4 it says
[6:15] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[6:17] world and this is the victory that
[6:19] overcometh the world even our faith our
[6:22] faith is the victory when you can
[6:24] believe
[6:26] like in verse 17 by faith Abraham when
[6:29] he was tried to offer it up Isaac and he
[6:32] that had received the promises offered
[6:34] up his only begotten son
[6:36] of whom it was said that in Isaac shall
[6:38] thy seed be called accounting that God
[6:41] was able to raise him up even from the
[6:44] dead from whence also he received him in
[6:47] a figure now this is how all these
[6:48] belief all these uh Saints in the Old
[6:50] Testament that we're reading about got
[6:52] the victory is by Faith by faith Abraham
[6:57] overlooked all of the circumstances and
[7:00] just trusted in what God had promised
[7:02] and he accounted that God was able to
[7:05] raise him up I got that highlighted
[7:06] because as we're reading these things
[7:08] out I just want to call out that that
[7:10] we're we're uh we're coming
[7:14] not not we're not believing God and
[7:16] without understanding what we believe
[7:18] we're coming uh uh recognizing he waited
[7:23] out like a balance should I should I
[7:25] trust God or should I just go on what I
[7:29] think is right and he accounted that God
[7:31] was able to raise him up and we'll read
[7:33] where Moses esteemed and all these
[7:37] examples of Believers that that took
[7:40] they they they didn't come just
[7:43] with like a veil over their eyes but
[7:45] they knew what they were getting into
[7:48] by faith A's Isaac blessed Jacob and
[7:51] Esau concerning things to come by Faith
[7:54] by faith Jacob when he was a dying
[7:56] blessed both the sons of Joseph and
[7:58] worship leaning upon the top of his
[8:00] staff by faith Joseph when he died made
[8:03] mention of the departing of the children
[8:05] of Israel and gave commandment
[8:06] concerning his bones
[8:08] by faith Moses when he was born was hit
[8:10] three months of his parents because they
[8:12] saw he was a proper child and they were
[8:14] not afraid of the king's commandment by
[8:16] faith Moses when he was come to years
[8:18] refused to be called the son of
[8:19] Pharaoh's daughter
[8:21] and there it is again he chose he
[8:23] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[8:25] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[8:27] pleasures of sin for a season and
[8:30] everybody's got a path laid out in front
[8:31] of them you've got the ability to
[8:33] account
[8:34] to choose and to esteem which way you're
[8:37] going to go it's all it's laid the same
[8:39] choices laid before us all like brother
[8:42] Brown said the message why Christ beat
[8:44] we've all got that gift and the
[8:45] stability the ability to choose the path
[8:47] that we go
[8:49] and in verse 26 esteeming the reproach
[8:52] of Christ greater riches than the
[8:53] treasures in Egypt for he had a respect
[8:56] unto the recompense of the reward
[9:00] by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[9:03] the Wrath of the king for he endured a
[9:05] seeing him who was invisible through
[9:07] faith he kept the Passover and the
[9:09] sprinkling of blood lest he that
[9:11] destroyed the firstborn should touch
[9:12] them by faith they passed through the
[9:15] Red Sea is by dry land which the
[9:17] Egyptians are saying to do or drown by
[9:19] faith the walls of Jericho fell down
[9:21] after they were compassed about seven
[9:23] days
[9:24] by faith the Harlem Rahab perished not
[9:27] with him that believe not when she had
[9:29] received the spies with peace and what
[9:31] more what what shall I more say for the
[9:34] time would fail me to tell of Gideon
[9:37] and a Barack and of Samson a little
[9:40] jephthah of David also and Samuel and of
[9:44] the prophets who through faith subdued
[9:47] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[9:50] promises stop the mountain think about
[9:52] how encouraging this is what they were
[9:55] able to accomplish by faith
[9:57] stop the mouths of lions quench the
[9:59] violence of fire escape the sword out of
[10:02] weakness were made strong wax Valiant
[10:05] and fight turned to flight the armies of
[10:08] the aliens women received their dead
[10:10] raised to life again and others were
[10:12] tortured not accepting Deliverance
[10:15] that they might obtain a better
[10:16] resurrection and others had trial of
[10:19] cruel mockings and scourgings yet
[10:21] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[10:24] were stoned they were sawn asunder were
[10:27] tempted were slain with a sword they
[10:29] wandered about in sheepskins and goat
[10:31] skins being destitute Afflicted
[10:33] tormented of whom the world was not
[10:36] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[10:38] mountains
[10:40] and in dens and caves of the earth now
[10:43] when Paul gets over in Hebrews chapter
[10:44] 12 he starts beginning to talk about how
[10:46] that you know you we got to be able to
[10:48] take chastisement and rough times and
[10:50] you think about all the rough times that
[10:52] these Believers went through because
[10:54] they had such confidence they accounted
[10:56] and esteemed and chose the thing that
[10:59] they knew was more worth worth more than
[11:01] all the suffering that you could you
[11:04] could have in this world in this life
[11:07] my brother Ram said and as I thought on
[11:09] my way he said did you ever try to put a
[11:11] valuation on what eternal life is
[11:14] what could you give for it
[11:16] if I could be turned back to a boy of 19
[11:18] 20 years old and would have all the
[11:21] world in the 500 years without sickness
[11:23] or old age or either live another one or
[11:26] ten more years and have all kinds of
[11:28] troubles and beg for my food and be
[11:30] persecuted and martyred at the end but
[11:33] have eternal life I'd take that now
[11:37] that's how much these these Saints in
[11:39] Hebrews 11 valued the promise that they
[11:42] had give they knew it was worth more
[11:44] than being or like like Isaiah song
[11:47] asunder grabbed out of a tree
[11:49] by that King and pulled over and tried
[11:52] until they stuffed him into a burlap bag
[11:54] and sawed him in half and and you think
[11:57] about all the other things that Paul was
[11:58] just relaying all the all the suffering
[12:00] many things that far surpassed any any
[12:03] difficulties that we have in our life
[12:05] but they knew that eternal life was
[12:07] worth it when 500 years was up it'll all
[12:10] be over but it'll never end with eternal
[12:12] life I'll live in the presence of Christ
[12:14] forever
[12:16] we just don't know what's wrapped in
[12:18] that treasure that God has given us
[12:22] and the message thirsting for life he
[12:23] said I've often said if I can be a young
[12:25] man of 25 years old if God would appear
[12:28] on the platform tonight and say I will
[12:30] turn you to 25 years of age
[12:32] there you will remain for a million
[12:34] years and I'll make you the king over
[12:37] all the universe everything will be at
[12:39] your command or I'll give you a hundred
[12:42] years of misery and woe and trouble and
[12:44] sorrow but at the end of that hundred
[12:46] years I'll give you eternal life
[12:49] but the end of the million years you are
[12:51] lost oh I'd say Lord God I don't have to
[12:54] wait any longer to make my choice let me
[12:58] have the Hundred Years of misery and woe
[13:01] any kind of a death that you choose for
[13:03] me to die only Lord give me eternal life
[13:06] amen for though I own the whole world
[13:09] and was king for a million years at the
[13:12] end of that million years I become a
[13:15] hell-bound creature for eternity but no
[13:18] matter how bad my lot is here at the end
[13:20] of my life if I've got eternal life I
[13:22] live on and the Blessed presence of God
[13:25] forever and ever oh now you can see you
[13:28] can look look like they did in Hebrews
[13:30] 11 that this time span that we're living
[13:33] in is just a blink of an eye compared to
[13:34] all eternity what what what is all the
[13:37] suffering and all the heartache and all
[13:39] the trials and things compared to living
[13:41] with Christ and living with the
[13:43] Believers and Saints forever and ever in
[13:46] eternity it's worth more than anything
[13:50] in Hebrews 11 verse 39 and 40 says have
[13:53] it and these all having obtained a good
[13:56] report through faith receive not the
[13:59] promise now I got a picture here this is
[14:01] another artificial intelligence
[14:03] generated image of Peter preaching on
[14:05] the day of Pentecost
[14:07] uh artificial intelligence has got so
[14:09] big at my work that I I'm playing around
[14:11] with it so this is this is totally com
[14:13] generated by computer which I think it's
[14:15] pretty interesting you can tell it
[14:17] generate a picture of Peter preaching uh
[14:20] in ad 30. and it will it will make it
[14:25] and you think though having obtained
[14:27] how'd they get a good report not by
[14:29] doing something but by but by believing
[14:32] the promise
[14:33] they didn't get the promise but the
[14:35] promise came on the day of Pentecost
[14:38] all these promises that were laid out
[14:40] through the scripture like in Joel where
[14:42] it said and it shall come to pass after
[14:43] that I will pour out my spirit it was
[14:45] promised in Ezekiel 36 he said I will
[14:48] pour my I will put my spirit within you
[14:51] Isaiah 32 said until the spirit be
[14:54] poured upon us from on high
[14:56] and the Wilderness be a fruitful field
[14:58] and Isaiah 44 says for I will pour water
[15:01] upon him that is thirsty now see there's
[15:04] the promise now that Paul's saying they
[15:06] could they didn't have access to This
[15:08] Promise they were walking toward it but
[15:10] they never got to experience it but now
[15:12] you you can experience it now see you if
[15:15] you've not been born again yet there's a
[15:17] promise laying for you and if you've
[15:19] been born again there's a promise you
[15:20] can have more of it you can have more of
[15:23] it every church service it's not just a
[15:25] one-time thing you can have as much as
[15:27] you want you just open yourself up and
[15:29] believe like they did and look to what
[15:31] God Said and look instead of the
[15:32] circumstances instead of what somebody's
[15:34] told you or what the devil told you that
[15:37] that it's past the days of Miracles are
[15:39] passed that is that I've gone too far
[15:42] you can have it because God made the
[15:44] promise now the uh what what promise are
[15:47] we talking about the promise of a holy
[15:49] ghost heart change that God can take you
[15:51] and change your nature and make you like
[15:52] him that's what brother Brown said we're
[15:54] getting to they without us cannot be
[15:56] made perfect so let's look let's read
[15:57] from the message it's a Perfection and
[15:59] brother Brown said as the worshiper
[16:01] realizing for committing adultery for
[16:04] lying stealing whatever his guilt was or
[16:06] even evil thinking whatever it was and
[16:08] the least Shadow he was guilty because
[16:10] it was his nature in the Old Testament
[16:12] it was his nature to just be
[16:14] somebody that's unregenerate even in the
[16:16] New Testament without the Holy Ghost
[16:18] it's just your nature he was a guilty
[16:20] person not maybe by desire but by Nature
[16:23] he was guilty and he had to recognize
[16:25] that this innocent little lamb died in
[16:27] his place and he felt sorry for the
[16:29] little thing but the man as soon as the
[16:31] lamb finally died with the blood of the
[16:33] Lamb upon his hands he walked from the
[16:35] building with the same desire in his
[16:37] heart that he had at the beginning why
[16:38] because the life that was in the little
[16:40] lamb life lays in the blood your life is
[16:44] in your blood we know that and the life
[16:45] in the blood of the Lamb was animal life
[16:48] therefore when his little corpuscles
[16:50] were broken and the life went out of the
[16:52] animal it could not come back to the
[16:54] worshiper because the worshiper was a
[16:56] human being the blood made a covering
[16:58] but it could not perfectly atone for the
[17:00] man left the building with the same
[17:02] desire to sin as he had in the first
[17:04] place but doing this he was looking
[17:06] forward to a time when there would be a
[17:09] perfect lamb come now see that's how you
[17:12] are made perfect perfect is the Holy
[17:14] Ghost the Holy Ghost is a promise of
[17:16] perfection
[17:17] that that perfect sacrifice would be
[17:20] applied to you to make you to give you a
[17:23] perfect covering that's why in verse 39
[17:25] he says these all having obtained a good
[17:28] report through faith received not the
[17:31] promise the promise of a holy ghost
[17:33] Perfection God having provided some
[17:36] better thing for us that they without us
[17:39] should not be made perfect how do I how
[17:43] can I be perfect in Hebrews 10 verses 1
[17:47] 2 Paul if we go back to what Paul
[17:49] already said in chapter 10 the law
[17:52] having a shadow of good things to come
[17:54] and not the very image of the things can
[17:57] never with those sacrifices which they
[17:59] offered year by year continually make
[18:01] the comer perfect
[18:03] for then would they not have ceased to
[18:05] be offered because that the worshiper
[18:07] once purged should have had no more
[18:09] conscience of sins what's the Holy Ghost
[18:11] for to take to change your desire to
[18:15] change your conscience so that you don't
[18:17] desire to do the things of the world
[18:19] anymore
[18:21] and and in Hebrews 10 verse 14 to 18 He
[18:24] said for by one offering he hath
[18:27] perfected forever them that are
[18:29] Sanctified where of the Holy Ghost also
[18:32] is a witness a witness to what that
[18:34] you've been perfected that you've been
[18:36] changed it is a witness to us for that
[18:38] after that he had said before this is
[18:40] the Covenant that I will make with him
[18:42] after those days saith the Lord I will
[18:44] put my laws into their hearts and in
[18:46] their minds will I write them and their
[18:48] sins and iniquities will I remember no
[18:51] more now you see where Perfection is
[18:53] tied to guilt if a guilty man comes into
[18:55] a into a courthouse and he's sentenced
[18:58] by the judge then he's not perfect he's
[19:00] guilty of the crime but if you come and
[19:02] the price has already been paid and the
[19:04] judge said I find no fault in you then
[19:06] he's looking at a man that's perfect you
[19:09] see what the Holy Ghost does the Holy
[19:10] Ghost is a witness for you that this man
[19:12] didn't do it he's a witness it's a
[19:15] covering to you that you've been
[19:16] perfected by the blood of Jesus Christ
[19:18] because when God looks at you through
[19:20] the blood he don't see all the things
[19:22] that you've done this slate has been a
[19:24] White Queen that's why in verse 17 it
[19:27] says their sins and iniquities where
[19:29] I'll remember no more you've been made
[19:31] perfect that's the promise that I'm
[19:33] talking about this this morning that the
[19:36] promise of Holy Ghost Perfection that
[19:38] when the Holy Ghost is applied to your
[19:40] life that when you're filled by it in an
[19:42] experience of the new birth that God
[19:44] changes your soul to make it perfect
[19:46] there's nothing nothing imperfect about
[19:49] a a soul that's been covered by the
[19:51] blood that filled by the blood of Jesus
[19:52] Christ
[19:54] and the message law brother Adam said
[19:55] now the blood could not be perfect by an
[19:58] animal but the blood in Christ was
[20:00] perfect now I will never be perfect and
[20:03] you will never be perfect I will never
[20:04] be perfect in your sight you will never
[20:06] be perfect in my sight but let's lay
[20:08] that aside
[20:09] what about in God's sight I look at you
[20:13] as a human I look at you as a brother
[20:15] but God looks at you through the blood
[20:17] of his son as a redeemed one Jesus said
[20:20] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[20:22] father in Heaven is perfect and not what
[20:25] you've done
[20:26] you have nothing to Merit it but it's
[20:28] what Christ did for you now that's why
[20:31] you need the Holy Ghost that's why these
[20:34] people in the Old Testament that we were
[20:35] just reading about were marching toward
[20:37] a promise that they couldn't have access
[20:39] to but one day on the day of Pentecost
[20:41] God began to pour His Spirit out and now
[20:43] from then on you can have access to This
[20:45] Promise of what Holy Ghost Perfection
[20:47] that we're talking about and brother
[20:49] Brown said in the unconditional Covenant
[20:50] that God made with the people it's not
[20:52] what I am who I am it's the Perfection
[20:54] of Jesus Christ and God
[20:57] that died in my place to make me what I
[21:01] am it isn't whether I can stand I can't
[21:04] it's whether he stood in my place Amen
[21:08] brother that would make a Baptist shout
[21:09] yes sir there's something about it
[21:11] that's real you see that's that that's
[21:13] where he's getting into is is it works
[21:15] or faith faith will produce works works
[21:18] won't produce Faith so it's not you
[21:19] working something up it's relying on
[21:21] what God did to change you and apply
[21:25] apply that atonement over your life it's
[21:27] God God doing everything
[21:29] it's not whether you can do it it's
[21:31] whether he can do it
[21:33] and brother Brown said in the questions
[21:34] and answers of law law having a shadow
[21:37] he said the germ of life is in the
[21:39] bloodstream and that was an animal life
[21:41] and an animal blood has no conscience of
[21:43] sin certainly not so it wasn't strong
[21:46] enough because it knew not what sin was
[21:48] but when God came down into the blood
[21:51] cell that was in Mary's womb that
[21:53] created the blood in Christ Jesus that
[21:56] human blood was powerful enough to take
[21:58] sin out of the human heart
[22:00] and when the worshiper comes and puts
[22:02] his hands on Jesus head and confesses
[22:05] his sin and the lamb was killed and his
[22:07] name's written on the Lamb's Book of
[22:08] Life then God gives him the same Holy
[22:11] Spirit it was in that blood and he
[22:14] confesses his sins wrong he has no more
[22:16] desire of sin that's the gospel no more
[22:21] desire or conscience of sin
[22:25] and the cross in Christ is the mystery
[22:26] of God revealed he said Hebrews 11 said
[22:28] they could not be perfect without us
[22:30] hands and feet cannot be perfect
[22:32] without the brains the knowledge the
[22:34] head and so forth see and we're all
[22:37] perfected in him so by one Spirit we're
[22:41] all baptized into one body
[22:43] free from judgment past from sin unto
[22:47] death now here's another AI image I made
[22:50] I wanted to make an image of a man that
[22:52] has just been found not guilty by judge
[22:55] and this is what it came up with isn't
[22:57] that amazing
[22:58] that the computer just come up with that
[23:00] image and this is not even a real person
[23:02] that's how far AI has come but anyway I
[23:05] digress that's what I'm what I'm talking
[23:06] about Jehovah Jireh he said guilty to
[23:09] the least is guilty to the whole and he
[23:13] calls for Perfection so how can you be
[23:16] perfected you can't look at yourself and
[23:19] be perfected but I looked at one that is
[23:22] perfect the one that took my place
[23:25] he's the perfect one now there's where
[23:28] you you come and you're guilty as
[23:30] anything and then you find out that God
[23:33] paid the price for you and he's made a
[23:35] way for you to be perfected and he's now
[23:37] you've been filled by the Holy Ghost and
[23:39] he's looking at you through the blood
[23:40] and not looking at your past there's
[23:43] where you you're not guilty anymore
[23:46] guilty is to the least as guilty to the
[23:49] whole and he calls for Perfection now
[23:52] that word perfection in the Bible is
[23:54] that tell he always I I don't know how
[23:57] you pronounce that but that means
[23:58] full-grown adult or full-age mature
[24:01] which goes back to what Paul said in
[24:03] Ephesians 4 13 till we all come in the
[24:07] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[24:09] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[24:11] under the measure of the stature of the
[24:14] fullness of Christ how are you going to
[24:16] be perfect how's your soul going to be
[24:17] perfect by the Holy Ghost how are you
[24:19] going to be a perfect man by the Holy
[24:21] Ghost
[24:22] how are you going to get the Holy Ghost
[24:23] by the word the word the more word you
[24:26] get it makes the word the word you
[24:29] receive makes a way for the Holy Ghost
[24:31] to have an effect in your life the word
[24:34] you receive is actually spirit and life
[24:36] that as you receive it is the word that
[24:38] you hear is actually claiming you and
[24:40] and changing you and molding you
[24:43] and Colossians 1 28 it says who we whom
[24:46] we preach warning every man and teaching
[24:48] every man and all wisdom that we may
[24:50] present every man perfect in Christ
[24:53] Jesus in second Corinthians 13 9 4 we
[24:56] are glad when we are weak and ye are
[24:58] strong and this also we wish even your
[25:01] perfection in First Peter he said but
[25:04] the God of all Grace who hath called us
[25:06] unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus
[25:09] after that you have suffered a while
[25:10] make you perfect establish strengthen
[25:14] settle you
[25:16] no that's that's why we preach because
[25:18] God wants to see a perfect church and
[25:21] you'll never be perfect until you yield
[25:23] yourself to what God has already done
[25:25] right Amen in Philippians 1 6 being
[25:28] confident of this very thing that he
[25:30] which hath begun a good work in you will
[25:32] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[25:35] and in second Timothy all scripture is
[25:37] given by inspiration of God and is
[25:40] profitable for Doctrine for a proof for
[25:42] correction for instruction and
[25:44] righteousness that the man of God may be
[25:47] perfect
[25:48] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[25:52] and we'll stop right there and continue
[25:54] on next time
[25:56] because he well let me let me read this
[25:58] God having provided some better thing
[26:00] for us that they without us should not
[26:02] be made perfect
[26:04] in Hebrews 6 says therefore leaving the
[26:06] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[26:08] us go on unto Perfection and we'll stop
[26:12] right there God bless you Saints the
[26:13] musicians can come forward
[26:15] [Applause]
