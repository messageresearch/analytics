========================================

well let's get right into um 1 Corinthians chapter 2 we finished 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and we're moving on to chapter two let's bow our heads and go to the Lord we're so thankful Lord for your word we ask Lord that you'll bless today uh uh prepare our hearts and Minds Lord to receive what you have in store for us I pray God that you'll bless the day of fellowship and bless our time together bless the word now as we uh as you help us navigate through these scriptures Quicken it to us and make it real to us give us the real essence of the meaning Lord we pray in your name amen so uh 1 Corinthians chapter 1 uh um just maybe to recap best I can from my memory uh I I don't have any slides today so just it it'll just be just be talking uh and if you can open open up your Bible of 1 Corinthians chapter to and just kind of go along with us but in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 Paul's kind of started off talking about how we need to the word of the word of God is the power of God and and we're not to um base our identity on a man like Paul or Apollos or Peter because we were uh we sit under a particular kind of teaching or anything but our our identity comes from the word and then when we uh Paul will reiterate that when you go over to 1 Corinthians chapter 3 he'll start doing that again because he's it's so important for the Corinthians to get that see he he really hits it in chapter one then he hits it in chapter 3 and then the and and then uh uh you know he he's he's talking in in chapter one about the power of God is is the word and so you when you get over in chapter two he kind of kind of continues on with with some of those themes talking again about U uh that that he's got he he's sharing some some wisdom wisdom that's different than the wisdom that you get from carnal understanding or teaching or all the Greek wisdom and so forth so just to kind of um give a give a quick overview of what chapter 2 is Paul's going to talk about what real preaching is so he's going to remind the Corinthians that when he came to share the gospel he didn't use fancy words or human wisdom but he's focusing on Jesus Christ and his crucifixion and then he's going to talk about this hidden wisdom that's that's different from the wisdom that the Greeks and the the Jews and all of the what's called quote smart people of the day had this hidden wisdom and then he's going to conclude with contrasting human understanding with spiritual understanding so that that kind of um and and he's going to talk about you know how only a person's own Spirit knows their thoughts and only God's spirit knows the things of God so if you really want to know about God you've got to have his Spirit dwelling in you so that that uh that kind of sets the stage for some of these things are um maybe a little bit difficult to really frame up in our mind so we really to we want to frame up before we dive into this that Paul's what he's really talking about when he talks about what true preaching and wisdom and so forth he's contrasting that human intellect with a revelation that you you know you can and and really before we get into this um think about where Paul came from that he sat under the feet of galeal and who um I I like that little that little series that they put out the chosen that that really makes when you if you if you watch that they they make galeal seem like wow you know that all these they've got all these different teachers but then Galeo comes on the scene like Galeo knows what he's talking about so if you sat under gal then you got some real good teaching but yet galio couldn't preach a present tense understanding in other words like Paul's saying I I I I come with not just a bunch of uh information but I come to you with a present tense revelation of who Jesus Christ and his crucifixion is and and that's what I'm trying to relate to you is not just some carnal understanding and not just something that I'm parting that somebody else G gave me some information but I've got I've got wisdom that can only be imparted by a Divine Supernatural relationship with a supernatural God so that's what he's talking about so he says and if you follow along in in verse one he he says and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God now now again think about you know gelu I'm sure was a great teacher a great speaker a great orator just like many other Greek philosophers you'd sit under the sit under the feet of Socrates or Plato and and boy they could frame things out in a way that wow that's really good and you get out like your little Almanac or whatever and read things and but he's he's he's framing up I I've come with something else but I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified so he's pointing everything back to Jesus Christ back to the word not not to some things that we we're just understanding in our head but not head knowledge but heart knowledge right and I and he look he says and I was with you in weakness he he was he didn't come relying on his own strength or his own courage or his own background that he had set up under galio he it wasn't relying on his own brain power he wasn't relying on his own carinal understanding but I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and if you really are are looking at U the scripture right and our responsibility right this goes for a minister Deacon any anybody that's got a role in the body of Christ you're going to approach it with fear and trembling recognizing the responsibility and all that goes with that so Paul is trusting he's he's relying and not on his own power or his own ability but he's trusting entirely in the power of God which is what he says in the next verse he says and my speech and my preaching now here's where we lay down what preaching really is my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom it wasn't even though he might have said under Galeo and learned a lot of things and had a lot of information packed in and and and Gia was actually teaching him the word but yet that won't do you any good unless you've got a real Revelation for yourself to lay everything together and put everything together and give the real essence of what it is and that's why he said I came not to you with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men now there is Zeo in that that that theme again that he he said in in chapter one and he's going to say in chapter three again our our faith our confidence is not that we set under Gia or something but it's in the power of God so in other words a present tense re revelation will produce Supernatural Works it'll produce healing it'll produce prophetic Insight it'll produce a ministry that's actually speaking to your present tent situation it'll produce the transformative power of God's word in your life I we were coming over this morning and we were listening to a message preacher sharing a testimony of how he was preaching in a service and and and the Holy Ghost struck this young person in this in the meeting and and they begin to think within themselves I want to I want that Holy Ghost and they didn't know nothing they they were just visiting the church and I thought it was an astounding testimony because they were just they they didn't really know anything about the message but they got to meditating on what the preacher was saying and all of a sudden the spirit fell on them and they begin to jump up right in the middle of the service and speak in tongues and and I I I just got me thinking as we were coming over this morning that that a real present tense revelation will do something in our lives when it's not just something uh relaying information or relaying putting things together by carnal understanding but a present tense revelation will do something in our lives it will I I I don't want to get away from every believing that God will still heals I don't want to ever get away from expecting that God will do Miracles because God is still the same yesterday today and forever now now look at what brother brandham said about these scriptures he said oh what a preacher that's great great man who he sought God and he said he said God I am weak and I don't know what to do I just pray you God to strengthen me take my infirmities away from me in these things so I can be stronger and God spoke back to him and said Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness and so he's he's saying uh you know Paul said and I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling so he's getting away from all of the uh just the intellectual the head knowledge part of it and and and and relying on God quickening that to give him a true understanding of what the scripture is saying he brother R would say listen to this man who was a warrior and stripped himself if there's anything that our schools needs today if it's anything our churches needs today is a stripping of themselves of your own thoughts and your own abilities strip yourselves before God unless you would try to do something within yourselves that's see what when when when when you study this out what Paul's really trying to say I didn't come to you with words of wisdom but I came to you with a power and demonstration I came to you he's coming with a present tense Revelation and that's where brother renold will make these statements about how we we don't need education see we don't need that side leaning toward galeal we need we need a present tense revelation of Jesus Christ we don't need theology we need a present tense reality so let's look at what brother Ram said he said today is too bad he said we kind of look to a well- Tred scholar or something that's who we think we find Christ in we go to schools we send our boys and off to school to seminaries which is all right but we find out they learn how to speak eloquent speeches and they make great talks and they're fine men there's no doubt and thousands of them and they know how to put the program over they know how to stand on the platform they know how to introduce Christ to the people but you come to find out most of that a lot of it too much of it is just that man not being exactly a representative of Christ but a leure see know he he's trained to give lecture you could ask him to give a talk that would actually Astound the people from his eloquence of speech and how he could hold himself and how he could hold the people Spellbound and but we find out he learned that in a seminary somewhere somewhere where they trained him how to do how different it was from St Paul when he said I never come to you with the Excellency of speech or with wisdom of the world but in the power of the holy spirit that your faith would not be in the wisdom of man and his culture but in the power of the Holy Spirit and that same message later on brother brand would ask the question are you lecturing but Jesus never said go into all the world and teach this or teach that he said go into all the world and preach the gospel now you really let's unpack that for a second cuz he's not saying we don't need the five-fold ministry that office of teacher he's saying that in all those fivefold Ministry offices you're bringing something not from your head but you're bringing it from your heart and that's what real preaching is real preaching is when it elevates it off the page and puts the real Essence in in in mind in view so that you're it it it takes it from just a Theology and brings it together unpacks it so you can sit there and like that young man say I want that Holy Ghost and it becomes a living reality to you so he said preach is to demonstrate the power of the holy spirit so preaching is being moved by the Holy Ghost to to uh to it's it's being speaking speaking the words that are laying there on the Page by inspiration that God can put everything together and then then he said these signs shall follow them it don't come by lecture that's right see that believe it doesn't come by lectures it comes by the presence of the Living God moving among in human flesh proving himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever that's right he never fails to be the same it comes so simple the Simplicity of it is what drives the intellectual mind away from it now what what you know so we're contrasting Paul's talking about I didn't come to you with that that wisdom of my head but the wisdom of my heart and brother R would say that he he'd make this these uh what really what it is is you know you know when you read you you start studying things out you get educated you're going to get educated first sitting here now you're being educated but then the Holy Spirit when he quickens it to you he makes it he he it's like the the picture of the cow that brother random always talked about the cow you don't have all the P the parts put together but the holy spirit will put it together right like like for example the Seven Seals there's a lot of different parts and symbols and things that you learn you learn separately the line and what what what is and and you start learning and years and years go by it seems like and you're learning things but then all at once the holy spirit will put it together and and you you see it you see the Revelation and then maybe you'll see like part of the first seal and then boom the whole picture comes into view and you're not looking at something some theology that you can pair it because somebody else told it to you but you're looking at a picture that God framed up in your mind and you can see it so that's that's the difference between just a lecture a lecture would be just relaying to you the information of with the background of what this the line is and going on and that kind of thing but the preaching is actually to put it together so you see what it is and you see how it relates to your life and you see what you can do with it and it builds your faith and your confidence so a lecture would be just some kind of like a formal in it's a form of intellectual instruction plan and structured and focused on providing information analysis and persuasive reasoning formal education or training but preaching is by Revelation inspired by the Holy Ghost now you know we get in our mind though that preaching is PR preaching is like an evangelist or somebody a camp meeting no preaching is every Office of the five-fold ministry is preaching is bringing something by a revelation I I I like I I I totally agree with what brother Chris Long said that time he said we've got to get to a place to where we're preaching the Seven Seals to where we understand it so fully until we can just sling it and and and the true Essence will sit will rest in the believer's heart and and it's not just we're trying to probe and and trying to study things out but we know it so good until we can preach it now that's preaching preach ing is where you the the true Essence is unveiled so that's why brother Brown we make these statements he said what we need is not education we need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in the church to demonstrate the power amen Jesus never said go into all the world and teach he said he never said go into all the world and do he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and the gospel is to demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost the resurrection so if well really to frame it up like this education has little to do with where you're sitting like School versus church it's not University versus church that's not what it is but it's more to do with where it's coming from your head or your heart is it coming from your head that's education is it coming from your heart it's Revelation amen and see many times it comes from our head it's it's going to come from your head when you're sitting there receiving it but when it's behind the pulpit it better come from the heart that's the point that's the point Paul Paul's trying to make that's right and the greater than Solomon is here he said as I made a remark last night I felt it sweep over the audience it kind of had a funny feeling when it returned but when I said education he listen he said this and it he felt a funny feeling come back from the people cuz they resisted when he said it he said education has been the mark of antichrist All Through the Ages education is the worst enemy The Gospel ever had and see he's not talking about math at school he's talking about education in the church he's not talking about in your University he's talking about education in the church and brother R in in leading of the spirit of God he said as soon as education comes in now this is what Paul's getting at I come to you not to you with a wisdom head knowledge but I come to you preaching the power and demonstration of the spirit and brother Brandon would say as soon as education comes in the phenomenon leaves the church Christ leaves he can't stand it they get so smart they know more than he does so the scripture is not given by education it's given by Revelation not education Revelation so as soon as education takes your pulpit and but he would say again further on in that message he said when Jesus come the Pharisees and Sadducees and Educators look where they were at religious oh holy my you couldn't put a finger on their life but you see they were unbelievers anything that doubts one punctuation of God's word is an unbeliever I don't care how religious you are Satan's religious too you've got to believe the word and if you got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will punctuate every word with a sentence with an amen See it'll never take from it it'll believe it now now I know I'm believer in the point a little bit but this is if you keep reading on through chapter 2 this is where Paul's getting to that I'm I'm not coming to you with man's Wisdom my head I'm coming to you with something that can only this hidden Mystery that only comes by Supernatural Revelation I'm I'm try to skip through some of these things so comparing gel Paul learning from from gum with Paul learning from Jesus Christ after he met him compare Moses sitting at Mama's feet and learning that's education but then at the burning bush he met God and he got an education from God not education but Revelation and then then he could go down and preach so education is just carnal wisdom but Revelation is the wisdom of God Revelation is the wisdom of God so in verse six if we keep reading on that's why Paul says how be it we speak wisdom we're preaching wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not now you you think what he's saying here he's saying I'm I'm speaking a present tense Revelation I'm giving you wisdom from God that can only come from God it can't come from some Greek philos oer or from the Jewish Scholars and he's speaking it to people that God has made perfect how how can you be perfect brother R would say I'm a stinker I'm a renegade every one of us are but before God we are perfect be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how can you be because a perfect one represents us there that Fountain is there every day fresh not some stagnated something but fresh every day that washes away all my sins he is that Fountain so wisdom we find out wisdom is a wisdom is that thing that it's Christ Living in us to make us perfect then because he's given you his that Supernatural understanding you begin to realize that you're perfect and what he's done to you what justification does so wisdom is a Divine gift from God it's not something just derived from Human intellect or worldly education but true wisdom is revealed by God God and it surpasses Earthly thinking what what what's wisdom W wisdom really is you know you got a lot of information that's knowledge but wisdom tells you what to do with that knowledge so WIS wisdom gives you practical understanding that guides your life in righteousness and truth it it it gives you Solutions it promotes humility and it leads to peace in other words it tells you what to do when situations arrive in your life how to deal with your family how to deal with your children how to deal with situations how how to how to talk to somebody that's a sinner it's it's wisdom because it's divine Supernatural Revelation like James said in chapter 3 James chapter 3 the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypoc hypocrisy so wisdom is a whole lot more than just knowledge your cleverness it's the Practical outworking of understanding that aligns with God's word nurtured by humility and fear of the Lord and is free as James said if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given him so Paul could say in in chapter 2: 7 of 1 Corinthians but we speak the Wis wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory now now that's why this wisdom he's talking about is not something that you get from intellectual knowledge but he's talking about a present tense reality that that's really important for us to grasp because you know you could you could say from a a a studious standpoint you could repeat the words of Martin Luther repeat the words of John Wesley but there's a mystery that's to be revealed in this day this present tense day the mysteries of the son of man and all of those things so you know that's really what a mystery is is where something begins to be slowly unveiled but there's there's more to know and it keeps unveiling it keeps unveiling and it keeps unveiling and so Paul explains in Colossians that what a mystery is this mystery is that he's preaching is really can be boiled down to Christ in us to Christ in you the hope of glory even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ and you the hope of glory you can see what a mystery is too when you start thinking about that there's a mystery of how you're born again a mystery of how you grow and a mystery of coming to maturity the mystery of what the Son of God is versus the son of man the mystery of adoption and all these things that and this is what Paul's talking about when he's preaching we speak to you the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom this mystery that he's preaching in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verses 8 to 10 he goes on to say and I'll I'll be closing in just a moment here which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath pref prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God so there he's talking about as he as he's closing out this chapter he's talking about revelation it it that this is such a beautiful these two scriptures I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard in other words the Hidden Truths of God that previously were inaccessible gel didn't have any way of understanding or unveiled through the holy spirit that all these things that are so mysterious because we've got access by the Holy Ghost he can he will teach us and make these things plain to us so then we can take we we can learn from that that there is no aspect of divine knowledge that is beyond the spirit's reach you know if you really meditate on what this is saying he says as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him so if you stop right there there's no way of knowing these things but you keep reading on and he says but God hath revealed him unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God you think that God is slowly he's unfolding his mystery to us where things that seem unreachable at first the spirit keeps unfolding it until it becomes more and more plain until we know what the future home's going to be like we start getting glimpses of things that are to be it's it keeps unfolding until we can see it more and more plainly and that's why brother Brandon would say in a hidden life he said and I'll close on this as the musicians come now when the Brethren receive the baptis AP ISM of the Holy Ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but Brethren that's wrong there is no Summit to God's power we move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of God has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about it's never been even revealed to archangels as laying just ahead for his church that we believe for Eye Has Not Seen Ear Has Not Heard neither has it entered the hearts of men what God has for them and store that love him now here's the clencher so let's move up and claim our rights when you start thinking that you can't understand and you've hit the wall no that ain't what the scripture is saying that ain't what Paul's saying it's time to take a hold of God's word move up and claim our rights and we'll stop right there and continue on next time with what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him we're not educated into the Body of Christ but God reveals himself to us by his Spirit God bless you Saints amen
