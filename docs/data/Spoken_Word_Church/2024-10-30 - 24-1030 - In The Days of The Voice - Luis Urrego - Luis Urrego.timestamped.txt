[7:12] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen
[7:15] praise God Amen well we we want to uh
[7:19] just uh I I got a little a little slotow
[7:23] tonight just because um at towards the
[7:26] end I want to give a little missions
[7:27] report so that's the reason why why I
[7:29] brought my handy little laptop today and
[7:33] uh so let's uh let's turn to the
[7:35] scriptures or you can read along with me
[7:37] I don't know if you can see that but uh
[7:39] we want to read from Genesis chapter 3
[7:42] Genesis chapter 3 and uh here in verse
[7:45] one and it says now the serpent was more
[7:49] subtle than any beast of the field which
[7:51] the Lord God hath made and he said unto
[7:54] the woman yay hath God said ye shall not
[7:57] eat of every tree and notice uh he the
[8:01] serpent saying he said unto the woman
[8:03] yay hath God said amen God had already
[8:07] said something right his voice is had
[8:10] has already gone forth right but then at
[8:13] Satan what he likes to do is he likes to
[8:15] copy anything that God does he just does
[8:17] it he has no original thought he has no
[8:20] word of his own amen he takes the word
[8:23] of God it perverts it and then he says
[8:25] something with it right and so and he
[8:28] said unto the woman yeah hath God said
[8:30] ye shall not eat of every tree of the
[8:33] garden and the woman said unto the
[8:35] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[8:37] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[8:39] the tree which is in the midst of the
[8:41] garden God hath said ye shall not eat of
[8:45] it neither shall ye touch it lest you
[8:47] die and that's what he said but now
[8:49] watch the serpent has his own thing to
[8:51] say to it and the serpent said unto the
[8:53] woman said unto the woman ye shall not
[8:57] surely die for God doth not know that in
[8:59] the day ye eat thereof then your eyes
[9:01] shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods
[9:04] knowing good and evil and when the woman
[9:06] saw that the tree was good for food and
[9:09] that it was pleasant to the eyes and a
[9:11] tree to be desired to make one wise she
[9:14] took of the fruit thereof and did eat
[9:16] and gave also to her husband with her
[9:19] and he did eat and the eyes of them both
[9:22] were opened and they knew that they were
[9:26] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[9:28] and made them M themselves aprons verse
[9:31] 8 it says and they heard the voice of
[9:34] the Lord God Walking In The Garden in
[9:39] the cool of the day and notice that this
[9:40] voice was walking amen it was a living
[9:44] voice amen it was a it was a person
[9:47] right it wasn't just any any old voice
[9:50] amen it was not anything dead or
[9:52] anything without substance it was God
[9:54] himself the one that said let there be
[9:56] light and there was light is the same
[9:58] voice that walking through the garden
[10:01] asking and seeking Adam Adam Where Art
[10:04] Thou amen not that he didn't know where
[10:06] he was but that he knew exactly where he
[10:09] was he just wanted to make sure that
[10:10] Adam knew where he was at and Adam and
[10:12] his wife hid themselves from the
[10:14] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[10:16] Trees of the garden and unto Adam he
[10:18] said because thou has hearkened unto the
[10:20] voice of thy wife this is verse 17 and
[10:22] unto Adam he said because thou has
[10:24] hearkened unto the voice of thy wives
[10:27] you see when you were hearkening unto my
[10:29] voice you didn't have these issues but
[10:31] now because you've hearkened unto the
[10:33] voice of thy wife and has eaten of the
[10:35] tree of which I commanded thee saying
[10:37] Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the
[10:39] ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt
[10:42] thou eat uh of it all the days of thy
[10:45] life okay all right you may be seated
[10:47] this evening praise the Lord amen this
[10:50] evening I want to talk about but in the
[10:53] days of the voice amen how many how many
[10:56] believe we're living in that day amen in
[10:58] the days of the voice and and and and it
[11:02] should be that we are we are that voice
[11:04] amen again as we were just reading that
[11:07] voice should be something active
[11:10] something alive something something
[11:13] something present amen not not some dead
[11:16] voice amen but something alive and
[11:19] that's the reason why it's so important
[11:21] amen that we take uh it's not it's not
[11:23] just about just the the the the the
[11:27] tapes amen which we we listen to the
[11:30] tapes we we we love that voice right but
[11:33] it wasn't really brother Brandon
[11:34] bringing out the things that he said in
[11:36] there it was God through the prophet
[11:37] bringing out those things and so because
[11:40] it was God through the prophet amen
[11:43] that's the reason why that voice still
[11:45] lives amen praise God because it wasn't
[11:48] brother branham's word it was the voice
[11:50] of God through brother brandham
[11:52] therefore amen we must receive that
[11:54] voice of our own amen and go and and
[11:57] walk with that voice amen that voice
[11:59] must be part of our Lives amen not just
[12:01] on a on a tape you see the reason why
[12:04] there's some people that say well just
[12:06] just the tapes only just the tapes only
[12:08] and that's it and and brother Brandon
[12:09] had had the had the word and we must
[12:12] amen but that voice has to live in this
[12:14] hour amen that word that message that
[12:17] brother Brandon brought amen it was to
[12:18] be a living message not not not a not a
[12:21] message on on on tapes and and on CD
[12:24] players and on MP3s amen because those
[12:27] things are not going in a rapture amen
[12:29] you're your mp3 player and your car
[12:31] stereo amen is not going in a Rapture
[12:33] amen but you are amen when you have that
[12:36] same voice amen uh uh speaking through
[12:39] you praise God yes
[12:41] sir amen so kind of getting ahead of
[12:44] myself praise the Lord now we're living
[12:46] in an age amen where we have so many
[12:48] voices and I have a different different
[12:51] voices here that we have that we're
[12:54] bombarded with on every corner amen we
[12:57] have social media
[12:59] voices platforms like Instagram and
[13:02] Twitter constantly flood us with
[13:03] information opinions and
[13:06] comparisons it's where people go and
[13:08] compare themselves a lot of times amen
[13:11] and if I'm not as good as this family is
[13:13] well we got to do better we got to do
[13:15] something about that because our
[13:17] pictures need to look
[13:19] right amen yeah our our our images need
[13:22] to need to need to look good for the
[13:24] fall everybody needs to be dressed a
[13:26] certain way we need to make sure that we
[13:28] look better than the other family right
[13:31] so so those are the voices that we
[13:34] receive amen that that cause us
[13:36] sometimes to to look more to that amen
[13:39] and it becomes a competition right
[13:41] brother that's it amen it becomes a
[13:43] competition sometimes rather than just
[13:45] something for us to just maybe enjoy and
[13:49] and and and and so so social media is a
[13:52] voice out there we also have the the the
[13:55] the the voice of news Amen in this hour
[13:57] we see news the news is just we're
[13:59] bombarded with 24/7 news Cycles a with
[14:04] global events
[14:05] negativity and all they do is leave us
[14:08] feeling anxious and overwhelmed amen
[14:11] there is no there there's not that much
[14:14] happy news
[14:15] anymore it's all negative amen why
[14:18] because it shock value amen brings them
[14:21] profits amen they're not going to talk
[14:23] about the good old lady down the street
[14:25] amen who who gave who did something good
[14:28] for a charity right here in the corner
[14:29] in Gainesville that that's that doesn't
[14:31] bring shock value amen amen let's just
[14:34] bring talk about Israel and Lebanon
[14:36] let's talk about Co let's talk about
[14:38] let's talk about the presidential debate
[14:39] and how Kamala is this and and Trump is
[14:42] that and all that that brings shot
[14:43] Valley because it brings Revenue to
[14:46] those to those companies it's all about
[14:48] money Saints if you think that this is
[14:50] something about something else you're
[14:52] you're missing the point it's all about
[14:54] money they got agendas to push they're
[14:56] told what to what to say and that's why
[14:59] why they say that's why that's why you
[15:00] see it constantly in the in the news
[15:02] Cycles because somebody's got to make
[15:06] money advertising and consumer culture
[15:09] we we are always um just just bombarded
[15:13] with with hundreds of ads telling us
[15:15] that that we'll be happy if we buy this
[15:17] and buy that you see and so uh it's the
[15:21] voice of consumerism right the more you
[15:24] spend the more happy you will be and as
[15:27] soon as you buy this latest version of
[15:30] this thing then you'll be set but once
[15:33] you get it and you've had it in your
[15:34] house for about a week you're going to
[15:36] want the next version is the same thing
[15:38] with your phone the same thing with your
[15:40] Apple watch it's the same thing you you
[15:42] think I've got it made I remember when
[15:44] the first Apple iPhone came out and and
[15:47] we we thought wow it just can't be can't
[15:49] be any better than this man that's
[15:52] obsolete now in 2007 when that came out
[15:55] or 2006 that that's just obsolete right
[15:58] now I and we thought it was the latest
[16:00] and greatest thing and and and it's come
[16:02] to the point where technology is almost
[16:05] so boring now because every single
[16:08] moment something new some new gadget's
[16:10] coming along and and some somebody you
[16:12] know I got some sometimes Brothers come
[16:15] up to me hey look at this and look at
[16:16] this I honestly don't really care
[16:18] anymore really because it's so it it's
[16:21] so overwhelming now so much gadgets and
[16:23] so many little buttons and so many
[16:25] features to thing I ain't even got time
[16:27] to even look at all that just give me
[16:29] what I need to do all I need is to be
[16:31] able to hit over over over and that's it
[16:33] amen to be able to get my slides going I
[16:36] don't need anything else amen but they
[16:38] want make you think that you need all
[16:40] that stuff and all it is is just for you
[16:43] to waste time amen so that you can look
[16:45] at that amen and forget about God and
[16:48] forget about the time I needed to go
[16:50] pray but yet I was sitting here trying
[16:51] to figure out the options about this
[16:53] this new phone that I have and and you
[16:56] wanted that new tablet so that you could
[16:57] study the word of God
[16:59] yeah but you got caught up with the with
[17:01] the with the options you got caught up
[17:04] with the with the how to update to this
[17:06] latest IOS to this latest OS and and you
[17:09] thought that it was you were doing
[17:11] something for God because I'm doing it
[17:12] for God and you're wasting your time on
[17:14] the actual thing rather than that thing
[17:16] being a blessing to you oh my I I didn't
[17:19] even know I was going to go there but
[17:20] somebody needed
[17:21] [Laughter]
[17:23] it it's how easy we get so distracted
[17:26] amen technology is very very distract in
[17:29] nowadays sure it's good and it it helps
[17:32] us like we're using it right now but if
[17:34] we're not careful it can be very
[17:37] distracting entertainment and streaming
[17:39] services is another voice that we have
[17:41] to battle uh with endless content on
[17:44] Netflix and YouTube entertainment
[17:46] competes for our time making it hard to
[17:49] find space for for reflection or space
[17:52] with with to have uh time with God right
[17:55] or even spend time with your family
[17:57] right the think oh well oh I'm spending
[17:59] time with our family we're watching this
[18:01] movie together yeah and that'll be fine
[18:04] that that that's good amen but there's
[18:06] other things that we can do with our
[18:07] families as well praise
[18:09] God and political and ideological
[18:12] polarizations is another voice that we
[18:14] have to battle in this hour polarized
[18:17] voices urge us to take sides feeling
[18:19] confusion Division and constant conflict
[18:22] I don't know of any time here in the in
[18:25] the time that I've been in the United
[18:27] States I came when I was 1987 I was 7
[18:30] years old I don't know of any other time
[18:32] that this country has been more divided
[18:34] than it has been now ever since 19 ever
[18:37] since 2020 covid really divided things
[18:40] amen and and and and and to me it seems
[18:44] like that is exactly what they wanted
[18:47] because if you have divided people then
[18:49] it's easy to to to to conquer them and
[18:52] so it's happening right now and so
[18:55] that's why you got people all you know
[18:57] Trump trump Trump trump and Trump's
[18:58] going to fix everything I'm sorry to
[19:00] tell you but Trump is not going to fix
[19:02] everything Trump is not the Superman
[19:04] that you think he is that doesn't mean
[19:06] that I'm for Cala and I'm am man that
[19:08] that just means that Trump is not my
[19:10] Superman Jesus Christ is the only one
[19:12] that could fix this
[19:14] nation and and uh and in in reality uh
[19:20] this nation's already
[19:22] gone brother brandham said this nation
[19:24] rejected Christ back in
[19:26] 1957 and so when he when they did that
[19:30] this is all just the symptoms of that
[19:33] rejection amen so I feel bad for the
[19:37] people you know they really they really
[19:39] think that the system is for them in
[19:41] reality the system is against each and
[19:43] every one of us amen your vote doesn't
[19:46] count you're you think it it does Amen
[19:50] but it really doesn't and so so I it
[19:53] it's all it is is is dividing so there's
[19:55] the voices of Pol of politicians amen
[19:58] the productivity culture is another
[20:00] voice amen the push to be more
[20:02] productive tells us to optimize every
[20:04] moment often at the expense of resting
[20:07] and and and and and spending time with
[20:09] your family you know to I got to EMB
[20:11] better myself and really what that ha
[20:13] what that does is it makes you
[20:15] self-centered and it makes you look at
[20:17] more at yourself rather than looking at
[20:19] other people and their needs you see and
[20:22] so that that although and I'm not saying
[20:24] that's bad that is a good thing for you
[20:26] to to want to be healthier and want and
[20:29] want to uh have more Charisma and then
[20:32] and and all those things you could go to
[20:34] YouTube and you can look at any YouTube
[20:36] uh uh any about any topic that's that's
[20:39] good you should EMB better yourself but
[20:41] often at the cost amen of you becoming
[20:44] self-centered because now other people
[20:46] don't do it like you amen and you have
[20:49] the word you have the word on it you
[20:51] know you're the expert although you only
[20:53] watch two YouTube videos but you're the
[20:55] expert on it amen because you are
[20:58] studying you're looking at that topic
[21:00] amen and you have become the expert and
[21:02] nobody else could do it like you now
[21:04] right it makes you look self-centered
[21:06] right amen so the productivity the the
[21:09] the productivity culture is another
[21:11] voice that we have to that we have to
[21:13] fight in this hour amen praise God the
[21:16] Self Health self-help and wellness
[21:18] industry is another voice constant
[21:20] Wellness advice implies we're never
[21:22] doing enough for our Mental Health
[21:24] Fitness or personal growth that can
[21:26] apply also to the previous voice that we
[21:28] were looking at Ai and algorithms and
[21:30] I'm going quickly here algorithms on
[21:32] social media and shopping sites tailor
[21:34] content to our habits amen you want to
[21:37] know why is it that I was just now
[21:39] talking about this with my friend or
[21:41] with my mom and all of a sudden I go to
[21:43] Facebook and it's showing me ads about
[21:45] this you know why it's because your
[21:46] phone listens to you amen your tablets
[21:48] listen to you amen those things are not
[21:51] private those things are there to to to
[21:55] bring that's why they bring those ads up
[21:57] amen because they're algorithms cookies
[21:59] and all those kind of things they know
[22:01] what you want amen amen and so therefore
[22:04] that's what they're going to bring up to
[22:05] you and it works wonders and it works
[22:07] perfectly I I I do internet marketing
[22:10] and and I've delved in those things and
[22:12] and it works so if it didn't work that's
[22:15] the reason why uh uh it wouldn't they
[22:18] wouldn't stop doing it and then the
[22:20] pressure to document life is another
[22:22] voice that we have to amen people think
[22:24] that they always have to document
[22:25] everything they do on social media amen
[22:28] the social pressure amen the the the of
[22:31] of documenting my breakfast documenting
[22:32] when I when I brush my teeth documenting
[22:34] when I'm going to the office documenting
[22:36] everything amen that it's becoming a
[22:39] habit amen and and and you think that
[22:40] that's that that's just part of my life
[22:42] I've got to let people know what I'm
[22:44] doing but you don't right you don't the
[22:47] people that lived back in in in 20 years
[22:49] ago they they lived just fine they they
[22:52] lived they actually they live better
[22:54] peaceful lives to be honest with you
[22:56] then and and with with the with the
[22:59] I honestly think that that's the reason
[23:00] why this technology is just so
[23:02] overwhelming and all these these things
[23:05] and you know what and I'm thinking you
[23:06] know what things were better back 20
[23:08] years ago in that regard because you
[23:10] don't have those voices those pressures
[23:13] that I I have a Facebook account
[23:14] therefore I've got to make use of it so
[23:17] I've got a docu I got an Instagram
[23:18] account therefore I've got to make use
[23:20] of it you
[23:21] don't you don't amen praise God and if
[23:24] it's bothering you and if it hurt if
[23:26] it's wasting your time just just get rid
[23:29] of it then amen you don't need to be on
[23:30] Instagram you don't need to be on
[23:32] Twitter and you don't need to be on
[23:33] Facebook or any of those things amen
[23:35] just get rid of it if if it's bothering
[23:37] you right amen and then of course
[23:39] competing expectations amen with so many
[23:41] roles to balance amen it can feel like
[23:44] we're constantly juggling expectations
[23:46] and trying to do it all amen so that's
[23:48] another voice that we have to uh conquer
[23:51] in this hour thinking that we are super
[23:54] moms or we are super dads and we could
[23:56] do it we could do it but but in reality
[23:59] at the end of the day you're just so
[24:00] exhausted and you don't even have any
[24:02] time for God because you try to give
[24:05] time to everybody else it's it's okay
[24:07] you give time to your wife to your
[24:09] children amen but at the end in the long
[24:11] run amen you gave everybody else time
[24:13] but you didn't give God his time amen
[24:16] amen and what does that do Saint comes
[24:18] upon you and say L's see it brings in
[24:20] that condemnation brings in that
[24:22] condemnation and you think that you're
[24:24] doing right so those are the voices in
[24:26] this hour saints that we have to battle
[24:29] amen when God Amen the original
[24:32] originally gave adam only one voice to
[24:35] listen to and that was his voice amen he
[24:38] didn't have to look and listen to any
[24:39] other voices amen but then Satan brought
[24:42] in his opinion his voice and now that's
[24:45] where we're in the uh in the uh
[24:48] situation that we're in now with the
[24:49] world praise God Amen so Eve she got
[24:53] distracted from the voice of God and and
[24:57] and so gen in Genesis chapter 3 where we
[25:00] just reading it says but of the fruit of
[25:01] the tree which is in the midst of the
[25:03] garden God hath said ye shall not eat of
[25:07] it neither shall you touch it lest you
[25:09] die so God had said this so his voice
[25:12] was already going forward right his
[25:14] voice was the preeminent thought or the
[25:17] preminent thing there in the garden amen
[25:19] and that's all that Adam and Eve had to
[25:21] listen to if they could just stay with
[25:23] that voice amen they would not have been
[25:25] in trouble and the serpent said unto the
[25:28] woman ye shall not surely die and so the
[25:31] serpent had a voice as well and we know
[25:34] it was the voice it was um it was Satan
[25:37] was the influencer of that voice right
[25:41] and so brother Bram says here in um he
[25:43] says many are like Eve Eve just stopped
[25:46] long enough to be deceived it's the
[25:48] reason why I have that image like that
[25:51] she's paying
[25:52] attention if she hadn't have stopped
[25:55] there have never been no deceiving
[25:58] because because she was listening to the
[25:59] voice of the serpent right but Eve
[26:02] stopped and when she stopped there's
[26:04] where she got her deceiving in other
[26:07] words brother brandom is saying that if
[26:08] you don't take the time right if you
[26:12] don't take the time Amen to document
[26:14] your lunch amen instead of spending time
[26:17] with God Amen then then you you you
[26:19] won't feel that condemnation then then
[26:21] afterwards right I'm just giving that as
[26:23] an example because that's what Eve did
[26:26] amen she stopped just long enough to
[26:29] listen to what the serpent had to say
[26:32] Amen to what the tree of knowledge of
[26:34] Good and Evil had to say and therefore
[26:37] amen she was she was she got deceived
[26:40] amen instead of pressing on brother
[26:43] brandham says amen we always talk about
[26:45] amen don't let the don't uh we're
[26:48] pressing on Amen don't let the battle
[26:49] press you amen but we're pressing the
[26:51] battle right praise God and do you do
[26:55] you follow follow me close now listen
[26:56] the reason that Eve was deceived let's
[26:58] say it together so I'll be sure you got
[27:01] it the reason Eve was deceived she never
[27:05] kept the full word of God that's right
[27:07] amen amen this is Brother bram's quote
[27:10] Satan quoted it to her but he never told
[27:13] her all the truth neither does his
[27:15] denomination see but she stayed long
[27:18] enough to get part of the word part of
[27:21] it you see that's what that's what fools
[27:23] you and that's what Satan does in this
[27:25] hour amen is that he gives you enough
[27:27] work word amen to allow you to not feel
[27:30] condemned as you're doing it once you do
[27:34] it then you feel condemned because you
[27:36] didn't stay with the full word amen you
[27:39] only had enough word to just do that
[27:42] specific thing and then Satan comes on
[27:44] top of it and that's when he brings his
[27:47] condemnation you see brother but it was
[27:49] his voice amen right Satan quoted it to
[27:52] her but he never told her all the truth
[27:54] neither does his denomination but she
[27:56] stayed long enough to give part of the
[27:58] word and didn't take all the word and
[28:01] that was the problem she didn't take all
[28:03] the word amen so as we were saying God's
[28:06] voice is creative it's active and it's
[28:09] alive Amen in Genesis 1:3 we see that
[28:13] God said let there be light and brother
[28:15] Bram said there is no inter you don't
[28:17] need that didn't need interpretation how
[28:19] did it interpret Itself by there being
[28:21] lighten right that is that is the
[28:24] interpretation of and God said let there
[28:26] be light amen light appeared
[28:28] amen and so that and that was God's
[28:31] voice I want you all to remember that
[28:35] God's voice and God's word is not two
[28:37] different things it's the same thing
[28:39] amen the voice of God is the word of God
[28:42] praise God Amen Psalms 339 says this for
[28:45] he spake and it was done amen amen he
[28:49] spake and it was done he commanded and
[28:51] it stood fast in other words it Stood
[28:53] Still amen it stood it stood it stood
[28:57] fast praise God
[28:59] amen and so quickly what is the voice of
[29:01] the lord we know the word the voice of
[29:03] the Lord there's different things you
[29:05] can we we'll read here in Psalms 29
[29:08] these are different things that the
[29:09] voice of the Lord is and the voice
[29:11] Psalms 29:3 says the voice of the Lord
[29:14] is upon the waters the god of Glory
[29:28] Cedars yay the Lord breth The Cedars of
[29:30] Lebanon those are trees really really
[29:32] thick
[29:34] trees the voice of the Lord continuing
[29:36] in the same in the same chapter the
[29:38] voice of the Lord divideth the flames of
[29:41] fire I like that I was reading that I
[29:43] was like the the voice of the Lord
[29:44] divideth the flame amen that's what he
[29:46] did with the three Hebrew children amen
[29:49] the voice of the Lord came in there amen
[29:51] and which was God himself amen because
[29:54] they stood with the full word amen then
[29:57] the full word stays with them hallelujah
[29:59] amen praise God and so it came in there
[30:02] and it fanned the Flames for them and
[30:04] they came out of there not even smelling
[30:06] like smok oh my if Eve would have done
[30:10] the same thing Amen in that hour when
[30:12] she was being talked to amen if she
[30:14] would have just stayed with the full
[30:15] word she would have come out unscathed
[30:17] amen and Adam would have come out
[30:20] unscathed amen but because she did not
[30:22] stay with the full word of God Amen like
[30:24] the three Hebrew children did they said
[30:26] we'll do anything for you you King we
[30:28] have respect for you but we will not bow
[30:31] down to that image we want to let the
[30:33] world know who we worship amen praise
[30:35] God and I hope that that's your desire
[30:37] tonight amen when it comes down to it
[30:39] amen you'll let the whole world know
[30:41] that I only Worship the Lord Jesus
[30:43] Christ and if he doesn't free me amen
[30:45] well I'm I'm still I'm not still going
[30:47] to bow down to the culture I'm not still
[30:50] going to bow down to the voice of
[30:51] Technology I'm still not going to bow
[30:53] down to the voice of social media or to
[30:55] the voice of the news Cycles amen I'm
[30:57] going to stay with the word amen cuz the
[30:59] word can fight for me amen president
[31:02] Trump can't amen CNN can't amen the the
[31:06] latest Android tablet can't fight for me
[31:09] amen but God's word will fight for me
[31:11] amen praise God because it's Eternal and
[31:15] it's able Amen to Flame the to to divide
[31:19] the Flames amen so that's what the voice
[31:21] of the Lord does it divides the flames
[31:23] of fire as well the voice of the Lord
[31:26] shaketh the wilderness
[31:28] amen the Lord shaketh the Wilderness of
[31:30] Kadesh praise God Amen and so that was
[31:34] the voice of the Lord amen powerful and
[31:36] Majestic but then also the voice of the
[31:38] Lord is a gentle whisper when he was
[31:41] talking to Elijah and Elijah heard the
[31:44] the sweet the still M SM Small Voice
[31:47] amen am praise God but it was powerful
[31:50] amen sometimes I don't know if it's
[31:53] happened to you but it happens to me
[31:55] sometimes the greatest things that God
[31:57] has ever been revealed to me have been
[31:59] in the quietest
[32:00] moments amen when I've been in prayer or
[32:03] when I'm praying often times the Lord
[32:06] reveals to me things as I'm praying I
[32:09] don't know if it happens to you amen but
[32:11] but but that that those are wonderful
[32:13] things and and I take that as as God
[32:16] speaking to me right there and then
[32:17] right if something comes because Satan
[32:20] didn't bring that to my
[32:22] mind some of those things have become
[32:24] sermons later
[32:26] on Satan's not going to bring me sermons
[32:29] amen so it must be God right amen but
[32:32] also the voice of the Lord is like
[32:34] thunder amen and and in John you know we
[32:37] we read there in John when where where
[32:39] where Jesus uh was baptized in uh uh uh
[32:44] or being baptized and and and and the
[32:46] voice came out of the out of the uh out
[32:49] of the sky and people thought that they
[32:51] had thundered you see but it was the
[32:52] voice of the Lord man a sound of many
[32:55] Waters we'll talk about that in a little
[32:56] bit commanding it's talks so commanding
[32:58] and clear it can speak through anything
[33:01] amen do you know that the voice of the
[33:02] Lord can speak through any it can use
[33:03] anything to speak through amen and I put
[33:06] here it SP spoke through a burning bush
[33:09] amen it spoke through a burning bush to
[33:10] talk to Moses right that mean that means
[33:14] the pre God's voice was right there God
[33:15] was in that bush amen God's voice also
[33:19] spoke to a through a donkey one time too
[33:22] Amen to to a rebellious Prophet amen who
[33:25] was going to go curse the children of
[33:27] Israel amen but he God used the donkey
[33:30] Amen to speak to a rebellious Prophet
[33:32] amen so God could use whatever he wants
[33:34] to amen and if he was able to use a
[33:36] donkey then I he can use he can use this
[33:38] dumb this dumb donkey right here I know
[33:41] he can amen if he was able to speak to a
[33:43] d a donkey in the in in the Old
[33:46] Testament amen I know that he could use
[33:48] this dumb
[33:49] donkey amen it's also a voice from
[33:51] Heaven amen praise God so that is the
[33:54] voice of God
[33:56] now in in and I'm just trying to go
[33:58] quickly here and Adam and Eve they
[34:00] separated themselves from this voice and
[34:02] we read we read there in Genesis 3:8 and
[34:05] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[34:07] walking in the garden amen now just
[34:11] think of this and we're going to go back
[34:12] to the to we're going to go back to the
[34:14] Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve were
[34:17] created that voice walked with them amen
[34:21] right that voice being God Amen that
[34:23] voice being the word right it was with
[34:26] them it was some much with them that
[34:28] Adam could SP could say uh uh mountain
[34:32] move over here tree I don't you know my
[34:35] wife doesn't like for you to be there so
[34:37] I'm going to move you over here you know
[34:38] my wife knows better about home
[34:40] decorating so uh uh you know let's move
[34:43] you over here and that and that and that
[34:45] tree had to obey yes it is why because
[34:48] Adam had the voice of the Lord amen
[34:51] praise God now we know Adam was eternal
[34:53] in the soul amen and if he would have
[34:55] kept eating from that tree of life
[34:57] eventually his body would have come to
[34:59] full eternal life amen but
[35:02] now sin came in the picture Adam and Eve
[35:06] listened to the voice of the serpent
[35:08] amen and so that separated them they got
[35:11] scared did they got now fearful from the
[35:14] voice of God because now the voice of
[35:17] God was walking through this in the same
[35:20] way because remember he's the same
[35:22] yesterday today and forever so if God
[35:24] did it a certain way amen when Adam when
[35:27] he was talking Adam amen he was he came
[35:29] down the exact same way to speak to Adam
[35:32] but Adam was nowhere to be found right
[35:35] how Adam was hiding behind bushes why
[35:37] because he was scared right and that is
[35:39] the same way we get amen when we have
[35:42] when we're under sin when we're done
[35:43] wrong when we're doing things
[35:45] underhandedly when we're not right and
[35:47] you know that you're not right what do
[35:50] we want to do we want to go hide y right
[35:53] we want to go hide from the view of
[35:54] others we want to go hide from the view
[35:56] of everybody else why because there's
[35:58] something underlying there that you
[36:00] don't want to be right it was doesn't
[36:02] want to be
[36:03] shown and so here's the same voice amen
[36:07] and they heard the voice of the Lord
[36:08] when that voice of the Lord was
[36:10] something sweet that would draw them now
[36:13] it's something that they want to hide
[36:14] from and it really wasn't them it was
[36:17] sin that came in the picture because now
[36:20] they realize they were naked y right now
[36:22] they realize they had done something
[36:24] wrong and so that voice of the Lord God
[36:27] Amen the grace of God Amen that even
[36:29] though that they were in sin even though
[36:31] that they had done wrong the voice of
[36:32] the Lord was still looking for them
[36:34] that's right amen that's why brother
[36:36] Bram said it's not you seeking God it's
[36:38] God seeking you amen it's God seeking
[36:41] you the whole time amen praise God the
[36:44] mercy and the grace of the Lord amen and
[36:47] it says here in Genesis 3:8 and they
[36:48] heard the voice of the Lord God walking
[36:51] in the garden so this voice amen had had
[36:54] could walk right it had two feet yeah it
[36:56] did it had it had it could move it could
[36:59] it could go from one place to the other
[37:01] and it was looking for them amen in the
[37:03] cool of the day and Adam and his wife
[37:05] hid themselves from the presence of the
[37:07] Lord God from that voice amongst the
[37:10] Trees of the garden y right and that and
[37:13] that's what people do amen when they're
[37:15] not right with God that's what they go
[37:16] do they go hiding amen they go hiding
[37:19] amen from the voice of God Amen they
[37:21] don't want to come to church they don't
[37:22] want to read the word they don't want to
[37:24] stay in the amen because why they have
[37:26] separated themselves from that voice
[37:28] because that voice condemns their life
[37:30] that voice condemns everything that
[37:32] they're doing that voice cond amen not
[37:35] not that it wants to condemn but it
[37:37] automatically does that amen because
[37:40] they know within themselves I'm not
[37:42] right I'm not right and therefore the
[37:45] that's what the word does because the
[37:47] only thing to do at that moment is to
[37:48] repent amen then when you repent amen
[37:51] you come back to the voice and amen
[37:53] everything's all right then praise God
[37:57] now look brother Bram said in the
[37:58] message the voice of God in this last
[38:00] days how many we live with believe that
[38:02] we're in the last days how many believe
[38:04] that that voice of God is in this last
[38:06] day amen Adam heard his voice in the
[38:09] cool of the evening and had fellowship
[38:12] with him amen I apologize that that's
[38:14] all the way down there um there was no
[38:18] condemnation to Adam he heard the voice
[38:21] of God and he said father now I lay me
[38:23] down to sleep and he laid down and Eve
[38:26] on his arm arm the lion the tiger and
[38:29] the wild beast laid right around there
[38:32] was no harm no way of getting sick
[38:37] amen no way of wondering if he'd wake up
[38:40] in the morning they're going to wake
[38:43] up amen Adam heard his voice in the way
[38:47] that he ought to have heard it in other
[38:49] words I I like that because brother
[38:51] Bam's saying when you are truly in tune
[38:54] with the voice of God it brings peace
[38:56] and not condemnation
[38:58] amen when you are really walking with
[39:00] the Lord the way you need to be amen it
[39:03] really amen when the brother is
[39:05] preaching and laying out the word amen
[39:07] that's what causes you to say Amen to
[39:09] the word and there's no condemnation in
[39:11] you to not say Amen to the word amen
[39:14] maybe you may not say it verbally but
[39:16] you're saying it within your heart amen
[39:18] why because there's no barrier of
[39:20] condemnation there but when there's
[39:22] condemnation there amen then that
[39:25] hinders you from listening to The Voice
[39:26] abut amen true but one day he heard his
[39:30] wife's voice brother Bram continues and
[39:33] then he says I better leave that alone
[39:34] for a
[39:35] [Laughter]
[39:37] while but he listened to the wrong voice
[39:40] amen amen yet it was his wife now I I I
[39:44] I highlighted this because I thought
[39:45] this was very interesting he said but he
[39:47] listened to the wrong voice yet it was
[39:49] his wife the closest tie he had on
[39:53] earth oh my it's the it's it's it could
[39:56] be man the closest thing that you have
[39:59] in your life maybe your husband maybe
[40:01] your maybe your wife maybe your children
[40:04] that's binding you amen from Walking
[40:06] with God the way you need to oh but I've
[40:09] got to do it for them I I've got to and
[40:12] you have not even spent time with God
[40:13] your own self you're not even thinking
[40:15] about your own soul trying to think
[40:17] about your children's Soul amen amen and
[40:20] it was that same thing that stopped them
[40:22] amen from listening to the voice it was
[40:24] it was Eve the one that he loved and the
[40:27] one that that that came out of him amen
[40:30] bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh life
[40:33] of my life it was her voice that caused
[40:36] Adam Amen to make the decision that he
[40:38] made that's why I have to stop that
[40:41] there and Adam's paying attention to his
[40:43] wife right there amen I wish we paid
[40:46] attention like this at church sometimes
[40:48] amen but but but you all are doing very
[40:51] good tonight amen amen praise God and
[40:54] you see and then that's what caused his
[40:56] downfall amen
[40:57] and so brother BR continues to say why
[40:59] didn't he like job like in other words
[41:02] why didn't he say like job to his wife
[41:04] thou speakest like a foolish woman in
[41:06] other words Eve what are you talking
[41:08] about don't don't you know bring give
[41:11] the word back to her right amen but he
[41:14] didn't amen
[41:15] amen he didn't I don't know what
[41:18] happened there he
[41:21] didn't all right and so brother brand
[41:23] continues to say if it would the whole
[41:25] human race would be living in instead of
[41:27] dying if Adam would have done that if he
[41:30] would have corrected his wife in other
[41:32] words oh my I'll leave that
[41:35] [Laughter]
[41:37] alone it changed the course of human
[41:40] beings and
[41:42] time but he heard a voice of God he had
[41:46] fellowship with it but when he turned
[41:49] amen just like Eve turned when he turned
[41:52] how did he know that his wife was wrong
[41:54] remember it was pleasant right I don't
[41:58] think Eve was bringing it to Adam Amen
[42:00] in an unpleasant way I think it was
[42:02] pleasant as well right amen therefore he
[42:04] had to he fell for it as well and that's
[42:07] how Satan comes to you he comes in amen
[42:09] with dainties amen if I could say it
[42:12] that way old British
[42:14] word he don't come with you amen with

[42:45] something very pleasant something
[42:47] specific to you oh yeah CU he knows you
[42:50] and he's known you from ever since you
[42:51] were born right amen so he knows what
[42:53] you like he knows what what attracts you
[42:56] he knows he knows how to uh keep your
[42:58] attention long enough amen you know when
[43:01] you go sometimes and you know I need to
[43:04] go back to Facebook and I there's some
[43:06] information an address I need to get
[43:08] there because I got to get next thing
[43:10] you know you're there scrolling on
[43:11] Facebook amen through people's feeds and
[43:13] you weren't even planning on doing that
[43:16] amen and they just look so it looks so
[43:18] good next thing you know it's been 10
[43:19] minutes and you've been scrolling Doom
[43:21] scrolling right that's Satan's Dain
[43:25] dainties Wast your time right now you

[43:33] how is that going to pay your bills how
[43:35] is that going to get you to the address
[43:36] that you originally needed to go to get
[43:39] it won't you see so it's time consuming
[43:42] praise God but it's Pleasant
[43:44] now so let's move on God's voice from
[43:48] from the prophets to Jesus throughout
[43:50] the Old Testament all you could hear was
[43:52] the voice of God speaking through the
[43:54] prophets that voice then manifested in
[43:57] through Jesus right that same voice that
[43:59] spoke through the prophets brother
[44:01] brandham said that it built the body of
[44:03] Jesus Christ amen and you can read about
[44:06] that in Christ The Mystery of God
[44:07] revealed brother brandom talks about
[44:09] that and and it says in Hebrews chapter
[44:11] 1 verse 1 and 2 God who at Su times and
[44:14] diverse manners spake in times past unto
[44:17] the fathers by the prophets hath in
[44:20] these last days spoken to us unto us by
[44:23] his son amen whom he hath appointed heir
[44:27] of All Things by whom also he made the
[44:30] world Amen so now that voice is moving
[44:33] from the Garden of Eden moving through
[44:35] the Old Testament through the prophets
[44:37] comes to the Lord Jesus Christ and we
[44:40] know the Lord Jesus Christ the son of
[44:41] man the head right amen that voice again
[44:45] manifesting itself manifested itself in
[44:48] flesh amen the brother Brown said that
[44:50] the the the voice of the prophets amen
[44:53] Jeremiah Moses and all of them amen they
[44:56] built the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:59] amen or in other words what does that
[45:00] mean it prophesied that the Lord Jesus
[45:02] Christ was coming and because it was
[45:04] prophesied and it was thus sayth the
[45:06] Lord that word had to come to place had
[45:09] to come on the scene and that's why it
[45:11] say it build the body of Jesus Christ
[45:13] right so so so and and so he was the
[45:17] Lord Jesus Christ with that same voice
[45:19] that said let there be light now
[45:21] speaking in flesh Amen to a to a humans
[45:25] just like you and me amen yeah but it
[45:28] was just the head amen it was just the
[45:31] head speaking at that time Amen brother
[45:34] brother Bram said that there were some
[45:36] things that the Lord Jesus Christ didn't
[45:38] do because he needed to do them at a
[45:41] specific time amen praise God and so it
[45:44] was the Lord Jesus Christ speaking amen
[45:46] the full word amen praise the Lord but
[45:50] now that voice has to keep moving amen
[45:53] amen praise God and so Jesus voice is
[45:57] God's voice in John 10 it says to it
[45:59] says here to him the Porter openeth and
[46:02] the sheep hear his voice and he calleth
[46:06] his own Sheep by name amen amen he had a
[46:09] word specifically for you amen and that
[46:13] word called you by your name it had your
[46:15] name all tied into it amen therefore
[46:18] that's why we could sing he knows my
[46:20] name amen praise God he knew it before
[46:22] the foundation of the world and that's
[46:24] why he prepared a word specifically for
[46:26] you amen because he knew you would
[46:29] respond to it amen because it had your
[46:31] name involved in it amen praise God and
[46:34] leadth them out amen and when he putteth
[46:38] forth his own sheep he goeth before them
[46:41] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[46:43] his voice amen they know that there's
[46:46] something about this amen that that that
[46:49] that doesn't sound like every other
[46:51] voice amen it sounds like it sounds like
[46:55] Like Home to me
[46:58] amen I remember when I heard the V the
[47:00] voice of God Amen through this message
[47:02] the first time amen nobody sat there and
[47:05] explain things to me word by word they
[47:07] they didn't go back and read the the
[47:10] Greek or the Hebrew or or anything like
[47:13] that the brother just just just
[47:14] mentioned what he was talking about to
[47:16] me uh and it and and it just drawed me
[47:20] amen something said that's that's the
[47:22] word that's the Bible amen and it was
[47:24] calling my voice it calling my name amen
[47:27] amen and you know you you've had your
[47:29] own experiences with that word that way
[47:31] something just draws you Amen to that
[47:33] and it says that's that's nothing but
[47:34] the truth amen it can't be anything else
[47:37] it can't be a lie it can't be something
[47:39] else it's got to be the truth amen and
[47:42] because you accepted it amen amen then
[47:44] that truth has kept you to this day amen
[47:48] my sheep hear my voice and and I know
[47:51] them amen that's why he can say he knew
[47:54] you before the foundation of the world
[47:56] all right right praise God and they
[47:58] follow me amen John 18:37 says to this
[48:02] end was I born and for this cause came I
[48:05] into the world that I should bear
[48:07] witness unto the truth everyone that is
[48:10] of the truth heareth my voice in other
[48:12] words everyone that is of that
[48:16] predestination representation of
[48:18] predestination amen or of that of of
[48:22] that thought amen of God right is going
[48:25] to hear his voice amen amen that's why
[48:29] amen the the prophets amen they they
[48:31] spoke the body of Jesus and that word
[48:33] had to fall amen exactly where it needed
[48:36] to be in order to build the body of
[48:37] Jesus amen God was watching over that
[48:40] word the whole time amen just as God
[48:42] watch that word that verse that's that
[48:44] exact verse or that word that you needed
[48:46] Amen to come in Amen in this hour that
[48:49] we're living in amen praise
[48:52] God Amen now the voice is in the whole
[48:57] body now praise the Lord amen now we we
[49:00] we know that there was a shout uh and
[49:02] and what is the shout it's the messenger
[49:04] calling the Brad together through the
[49:06] message amen and we also know that there
[49:09] was a voice in John 11 that same voice
[49:12] that raised Lazarus from the dead is the
[49:14] same voice that will raise the sleeping
[49:15] bride Amen in this hour throughout all
[49:17] the ages amen those who have died
[49:19] Through the Ages brother Brandon said in
[49:21] the sermon the Rapture amen praise God
[49:24] and he says this the second is a voice
[49:26] of of the Resurrection the same voice
[49:28] amen amen that see the bride is not
[49:31] going to speak anything outside of the
[49:33] voice of God Amen she stays with what is
[49:36] the voice of God Amen it's the word
[49:38] amen it's it's him am amen that's the
[49:42] voice praise God that a loud voice in St
[49:46] John 11: 38:44 that called Lazarus from
[49:48] the grave you see amen getting the bride
[49:52] together and then the resurrection of
[49:53] the dead but you see if Jesus did it
[49:55] amen as the son of man here on Earth
[49:57] then his bride has to follow amen they
[50:00] has follow the same suit amen praise God
[50:03] whatever the head does the body follows
[50:05] amen why because it's of the same voice
[50:08] and there's that connection I like what
[50:10] brother uh the brother Steve what's his
[50:12] name Steven Wilson was saying that he is
[50:14] the head and we are the body amen we're
[50:16] the we're the neck that connects to the
[50:18] Head amen praise God and where are those
[50:20] vocal
[50:22] cords amen praise God but she only
[50:25] speaks by his voice
[50:27] amen praise God he is the head amen but
[50:30] she speaks only by his voice amen praise
[50:33] the Lord Jesus Christ so it it's it's
[50:36] you know sometimes we hear we hear you
[50:38] know uh I'm the head of the house but
[50:40] then we also know that you know well I'm
[50:42] the neck that moves the
[50:43] [Laughter]
[50:48] head but it's it's really amen God that
[50:52] this body does not move amen spiritually
[50:54] speaking now this body does not move
[50:56] unless the head gives it the the the
[50:58] Commandment right really and that's
[51:00] that's how it should be praise the Lord
[51:02] it has to come from the head first then
[51:04] the body moves amen amen if the body is
[51:07] doing something involuntarily amen that
[51:10] the head is not commanding it then it's
[51:12] not it's not there's no full connection
[51:14] there something is something is is
[51:16] missing or something is lacking amen and
[51:19] that's the reason why we always have to
[51:20] check up in our lives oh you know I like
[51:24] this part of the Bible but when it comes
[51:26] to this I'm not sure because I don't
[51:29] know I just don't feel like it's
[51:33] needful the word says it which is the
[51:35] voice amen The Voice amen that you speak
[51:39] is not anything outside of what the head
[51:42] is already thinking or what the head
[51:44] already thought you see you only stay
[51:46] with the word amen that's that's the
[51:48] only thing that the body amen the bride
[51:50] stays with the word which is the voice
[51:52] in this hour all right and then the
[51:55] trumpet we know that that it's going to
[51:56] announce the Gathering of the Bride
[51:59] symbolized as a feast in the sky for the
[52:01] wedding supper of the lamb praise the
[52:03] Lord Jesus amen so we're there that the
[52:07] shout The Voice the trumpet amen you can
[52:10] I believe it's in first Thessalonian or
[52:12] second Thessalonians where Paul talks
[52:14] about this now just moving quickly she
[52:17] uh she is him
[52:20] um and brother Bram says in the rising
[52:22] of the Sun and as he being the groom the
[52:24] bride has to come forth C it's part of
[52:27] him amen it can only be the
[52:28] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[52:31] the revelations of uh uh any others has
[52:34] spok of the Bride it can only manifest
[52:37] if it does something different from the
[52:38] groom it isn't the bride amen amen if
[52:42] it's something different if it's your
[52:43] own opinion it's not part of his voice
[52:46] amen that's your own voice then praise
[52:49] God because she is flesh of his flesh
[52:52] bone of his bone life of his life power
[52:55] of His of his power she is him amen why
[53:00] that's what makes her him amen because
[53:03] she is part of the same voice she's part
[53:06] of the same mold in other words praise
[53:08] God as men and women are one and women
[53:11] and woman taken from his side she had
[53:14] taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from
[53:16] him the flesh from his side made both
[53:19] mechanics and Dynamics in the wife the
[53:22] spirit of him and the Flesh of him and
[53:25] put it together and me that that neck
[53:28] and that head and made mechanics and
[53:30] Dynamics until the church or the
[53:34] people all right now quickly in
[53:38] Revelations chapter 10 one it says this
[53:41] this is John speaking and I was in the
[53:42] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[53:44] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[53:47] right saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[53:50] first and the last and what thou see us
[53:52] right in a book and send it unto the
[53:54] seven churches which are in Asia unto e
[53:56] eus and unto smyna and unto pergamus and
[53:58] unto thar unto Sardis and unto
[54:00] Philadelphia and unto leosia and I
[54:02] turned to see the voice that spake with
[54:04] me John turned to to see the voice and
[54:06] being turned I saw seven golden
[54:08] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[54:10] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[54:12] of man clothed with a garment down to
[54:14] the foot and G about the paps with a
[54:16] golden girdle amen praise the Lord that
[54:19] is feminist amen amen praise the Lord
[54:22] his head and his hairs were white like
[54:25] wool as white as snow and his eyes were
[54:28] as a flame of fire and his feet like
[54:31] unto fine brass as if they burned in a
[54:34] furnace and his voice has the sound of
[54:36] many Waters amen this is where I want to
[54:38] talk about the many Waters praise the
[54:40] Lord Jesus because here John is looking
[54:42] at this scene he's looking at the Lord
[54:44] Jesus Christ and he and and and when
[54:47] when he turns and looks at it and he
[54:49] sees the Lord Jesus Christ amen but when
[54:53] he hears his voice it's at the voice of
[54:55] many Waters
[54:56] in other words the voice of many and
[54:58] what does Waters represent it represents
[55:00] people amen praise God and so what is
[55:03] making up the body of Christ amen it's
[55:06] you and I in this house that's the
[55:08] reason why John when he turned and
[55:10] looked amen he saw the he saw the Lord
[55:13] Jesus Christ but what was speaking amen
[55:15] through his voice amen were many people
[55:18] amen it was you and I in this hour amen
[55:20] so that voice amen now Adam did not have
[55:24] that voice amen EX exactly the way he
[55:27] wanted it because he separated himself
[55:29] from that voice Here Comes Here Comes
[55:32] the the pro the pro the the the the
[55:34] prophets amen they build up the body of
[55:36] Christ that voice is in the Lord Jesus
[55:38] Christ he is the head but we know as we
[55:41] talked about the other day God is not he
[55:44] he doesn't have a freak body right amen
[55:47] it's not just a head floating amen right
[55:50] and it's not just a headless body
[55:52] walking right it's a head and a body
[55:55] together amen praise the Lord and so now
[55:58] that voice amen has traveled amen from
[56:00] the son of man now that son of man is in
[56:03] the bride today praise the Lord she is
[56:06] him amen praise God that exact same
[56:08] voice amen the sound of many Waters
[56:11] praise the Lord Jesus brother brandom
[56:12] called it the sound of of of the
[56:14] ministry amen the sound of the preachers
[56:16] in that in in in this hour amen praise
[56:19] the Lord Jesus but but you are the
[56:21] preachers today amen praise God it's not
[56:24] just not just the five-fold ministry you
[56:26] if this voice is in you you can say to
[56:29] this mountain amen move here and it'll
[56:31] move amen it's got to obey you amen you
[56:34] can call things as they are as they're
[56:36] and they're as they're not or as they're
[56:37] not as they are amen because that same
[56:40] voice dwells in you in this hour amen
[56:43] you don't have to depend on just the
[56:44] preacher brother way to pray for you or
[56:47] or or or the the the Evangelist to come
[56:49] in here or wait for brother Andrew
[56:50] globber to come through here amen you've
[56:53] got the power in this hour amen why
[56:55] because you have the same word that they
[56:57] do amen that voice is in you in this
[57:01] hour amen oh but I'm not I'm not where I
[57:04] should be amen well get right with God
[57:06] Amen then you can be where you where you
[57:08] can and speak in conditions amen there's
[57:11] nothing holding you back amen there's
[57:14] nothing holding you you holding yourself
[57:17] amen God already said amen I want this
[57:19] voice to travel from amen from just the
[57:22] Garden of Eden Amen to the head which is
[57:24] the Lord Jesus Christ and now to the
[57:26] body amen praise God where the vocal
[57:29] cords
[57:30] are amen praise the Lord right brother
[57:33] spiritual vocal cords hallelujah amen oh
[57:37] my praise God thank God for that amen
[57:42] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[57:45] and out of his mouth went a Shar what
[57:47] went out of his
[57:49] mouth the
[57:51] voice because what is the voice the word
[57:55] what is the word the two-edged sword
[57:57] hallelujah amen amen his mouth went a
[58:00] sharp two-edged sword and and his
[58:02] countenance was as the son shineth in
[58:04] his strength hallelujah amen thank God
[58:08] Amen that he that God wasn't wasn't
[58:10] selfish with his word amen amen God
[58:13] wants you to enjoy his word just as much
[58:15] as he enjoyed it speaking it amen amen
[58:18] he wants you to speak it as well amen he
[58:20] wants you to create with his word you
[58:22] have just as much power and disire to
[58:25] create amen
[58:27] amen now then that's where I get the
[58:30] title of this of this sermon but in the
[58:32] days of the voice amen Revelations 107
[58:35] says but in the days of the voice of the
[58:36] seventh angel we know brother brandham
[58:38] had a he he spoke out sure but it wasn't
[58:42] brother branham's voice per se right
[58:44] because brother brandham didn't have a
[58:45] word of his own right remember what is
[58:48] the voice it's the word amen right it's
[58:51] an active Living Word Amen brother
[58:53] brandham is long gone y right right we
[58:56] know that we'll see him again amen
[58:58] praise the Lord but that voice still has
[59:00] power in this hour in you and me amen
[59:03] when you are listening to the prophet
[59:04] when you're listening to those messages
[59:06] amen it's still influencing you but it's
[59:10] not necessarily brother branham's voice
[59:12] it's the word of God that was spoken
[59:14] through his voice amen that's what's
[59:17] influencing you in this hour but in the
[59:19] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[59:21] that is that is the prophet amen the the
[59:24] the the church age messenger of L
[59:26] brother brandham when he shall begin to
[59:29] sound amen the mystery of God should be
[59:31] finished as he hath declared to his
[59:34] servants the prophets right now verse
[59:36] eight look what verse eight says and the
[59:38] voice which I heard from Heaven amen do
[59:41] you think that that's the same voice
[59:43] that that the messenger of of of of
[59:45] Revelations 10:7 heard as well it's got
[59:48] to be the from the same Source amen so
[59:51] what does John represent John represents
[59:53] the bride he's a type of the Bride she's
[59:56] hearing the exact same voice that the
[59:57] voice of the seventh Church age Angel
[1:00:00] the the the the person in Revelations
[1:00:01] 10:7 heard as well amen that's why she
[1:00:05] is him amen not she is brother brandham
[1:00:08] she is God Amen and the voice which I
[1:00:10] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[1:00:12] and said go and take the little book now
[1:00:15] it's interesting that in Revelations
[1:00:17] 10:7 it says but in the days of the
[1:00:19] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:00:21] begin to sound there's something that
[1:00:23] brother Brenham did he began to sound
[1:00:25] but then there's something that we must
[1:00:27] do in Revelations 10:8 with this voice
[1:00:30] as well amen and said go and take the
[1:00:33] little book amen which is open in the
[1:00:36] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[1:00:37] the sea and upon the earth oh it's not
[1:00:40] enough Saints for just the preacher to
[1:00:42] study the word amen it's not enough for
[1:00:44] just the Evangelist to study the word or
[1:00:46] the pastor amen you've got to take the
[1:00:48] open little book let me tell you what
[1:00:50] the book is open it's not closed so it's
[1:00:54] not too difficult to study am amen
[1:00:57] praise God it's open book in this hour
[1:00:59] amen God has spoken it amen through the
[1:01:02] church seventh Church age
[1:01:04] messenger and it's up to us to take it
[1:01:07] in it's up to you amen if you're going
[1:01:09] to take it in or not but the book is
[1:01:11] open am amen the book is open that's for
[1:01:15] sure amen and so in Revelations 3:20 it
[1:01:18] says yep behold I stand at the door and
[1:01:21] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:01:24] the door this is Jesus speaking If any
[1:01:26] man hear my voice and open the door I
[1:01:29] will come into him amen when you take
[1:01:33] that voice you're taken in the word y
[1:01:35] that means Christ will come into you
[1:01:37] amen and will Su with you what's up amen
[1:01:40] have dinner with you that's right amen
[1:01:42] take you for a nice dinner and not just
[1:01:44] one nice dinner amen you can have just
[1:01:47] one nice dinner at Golden Corral or or
[1:01:49] or or or you know depending on what your
[1:01:53] you know your finances you know it might
[1:01:54] be Denny's or might be Taco Bell you
[1:01:57] know and it could be a it can be a nice
[1:01:58] dinner for you amen but then there's
[1:02:01] also you know the the nice restaurants
[1:02:03] in Atlanta you know that you could go to
[1:02:06] but but you know what that that is just
[1:02:07] one time you know Jesus Christ is always
[1:02:11] supping with us he's always buying me
[1:02:14] nice fancy dinners amen praise God and
[1:02:17] I'm always buying him fine fancy dinners
[1:02:20] when I hear his word receive his word
[1:02:22] amen we're supping together we're we're
[1:02:24] communicating with here what is
[1:02:26] fellowship amen two two fellows in one
[1:02:28] ship right amen and then it's two
[1:02:31] fellows in this word amen there's
[1:02:32] something to talk about but that's where
[1:02:35] the reason why amen when there's nothing
[1:02:37] to talk about with somebody is probably
[1:02:39] they're not in the word the way they
[1:02:40] should but either both of them are not
[1:02:43] in the word or one of them is not in the
[1:02:44] word and they're not compatible right
[1:02:47] amen that's why sometimes are not a lot
[1:02:50] to talk about with some people amen that
[1:02:52] might be just the way they are but
[1:02:54] sometimes it's because they really don't
[1:02:56] they don't they're not in the word the
[1:02:58] way amen and you don't really fellowship
[1:03:00] with what they with with what they're
[1:03:02] they want to talk about you see they
[1:03:04] want to talk about hockey or they want
[1:03:05] to talk about football and you don't
[1:03:07] really Fellowship around that right amen
[1:03:09] you might know a couple of scores here
[1:03:11] and there or whatever but that's not
[1:03:12] your Forte right your Forte is the word
[1:03:15] amen when somebody wants to talk to you
[1:03:17] about the word amen because you are part
[1:03:19] of the word you're a part of the voice
[1:03:21] amen that Voice rings to you right that
[1:03:24] sounds that sounds good to me amen
[1:03:26] praise God and I will come into him and
[1:03:29] I will s with him in other words he will
[1:03:31] fellowship and he with me amen so he's
[1:03:35] buying you dinner and you're buying him
[1:03:36] dinner right amen you both buying each
[1:03:39] other dinner amen and and it it's
[1:03:41] Eternal food it it's it's food that
[1:03:43] doesn't spoil oh my amen the steak at uh
[1:03:48] you know the steak wherever you know at
[1:03:50] that at that house over there brother
[1:03:52] Danny that that you like up there in
[1:03:54] Helen Georgia
[1:03:56] that's going to fade
[1:03:58] away amen but this steak never Fades
[1:04:00] away amen oh my this is eternal food
[1:04:03] amen so I say this Saints amen and with
[1:04:06] this we'll finish up and I have a few
[1:04:08] slides to show about some missions trips

[1:07:00] condemnation praise God hallelujah amen
[1:07:04] how many love the Lord amen amen praise
[1:07:08] God well real quick I just wanted to
[1:07:10] I've been needing to do this for about a
[1:07:12] week and a half or a month and a half or
[1:07:14] so but uh this is uh the our Portugal
[1:07:17] trip in in
[1:07:19] September uh back in September now this
[1:07:21] is brother
[1:07:23] martio right here um
[1:07:26] uh in the middle and he is the he was
[1:07:28] the hosting Pastor who invited me to
[1:07:31] minister at the meetings that they were
[1:07:32] having so the meetings that they were
[1:07:34] having were uh the first meetings that
[1:07:39] that were hold held in message
[1:07:42] convention that was hold held in in
[1:07:44] Portugal um brother Brandon was there
[1:07:47] back in 1954 in Portugal and when you
[1:07:50] type in in in in in the message and you
[1:07:53] type in what brother Bram said about
[1:07:54] Portugal you're only find about uh nine
[1:07:57] nine quotes and whenever he would refer
[1:08:00] to uh Portugal he he would refer to it
[1:08:02] as
[1:08:03] Portuguese so he would he wouldn't say
[1:08:05] Portugal he would just refer as
[1:08:06] Portuguese but the Portuguese are the
[1:08:08] actual people you see so brother brother
[1:08:12] Marcio brother Marcio the Gama he's from
[1:08:14] he's originally from Brazil that's his
[1:08:16] wife sister teodora and that's one of
[1:08:18] his sons right there on the right
[1:08:20] brother heft and uh they picked us up
[1:08:23] from their airport that day and brother
[1:08:25] brother uh Marcel just him and his
[1:08:28] children they had they had this Vision
[1:08:30] that hey look why don't we why don't we
[1:08:31] hold meetings here in Portugal to
[1:08:33] celebrate 70 years since the prophet was
[1:08:36] there right and so that was what that's
[1:08:39] what they did and they invited different
[1:08:41] ministers from different parts and I
[1:08:44] just happened to be one of them so I I
[1:08:46] appre I appreciate brother Marcio doing
[1:08:49] that for us
[1:08:50] now brother Marcel well this this is the
[1:08:53] in front of his church and these are
[1:08:55] just pictures of just kind of you get an
[1:08:57] idea of kind of the streets of how they
[1:08:59] look there in in in uh in Portugal this
[1:09:02] is in in uh what's the name of in montio
[1:09:05] where where where the church is located
[1:09:07] and also where brother Marcio lives um
[1:09:10] and so it's very European likee because
[1:09:12] Portugal is is in Europe so uh so it's a
[1:09:16] country right next to Spain and so so
[1:09:20] the the first night that when we got
[1:09:22] there um it was on a Wednesday I believe
[1:09:26] and I I thought that I just had to to
[1:09:29] preach later on that week when the
[1:09:31] meetings actually started so I I got
[1:09:35] there we we brother martiel picked us up
[1:09:38] took us to the to the place where we
[1:09:39] were staying at and know we rested a
[1:09:42] little bit because they're about 6 hours
[1:09:44] difference in time so right now it's 6
[1:09:47] hours ahead right now in time and so
[1:09:50] when I we got ready to go to church that
[1:09:53] night right and we had flown almost all
[1:09:55] day and um we got ready and and good
[1:09:59] thing I wore my suit and tie and
[1:10:01] everything because when we got to church
[1:10:03] brother Mario said why don't you sit
[1:10:05] over there and he was pointing to his
[1:10:06] desk why don't you go go sit over there
[1:10:09] and I said
[1:10:11] okay and so I quickly took out my tablet
[1:10:14] and started looking through some
[1:10:16] notes cuz I I didn't know that he wanted
[1:10:19] me to preach and so uh I asked brother
[1:10:23] Mario while I was sitting there I said
[1:10:24] brother Mario you want me me to minister
[1:10:25] tonight oh yeah yeah never told me to so
[1:10:30] that's that right there you know you
[1:10:32] have to be instant in season and out of
[1:10:34] season as the word
[1:10:36] say and honestly Saints I I really did
[1:10:39] not have really something prepared
[1:10:42] however I just said Lord you know take
[1:10:45] these thoughts and let me just move on
[1:10:47] and let me tell you what Saints we had
[1:10:49] church that night amen it was it was
[1:10:51] such a blessing to me and people were up
[1:10:54] in the alt and and just just thanking
[1:10:57] God and we just really and brother
[1:10:58] Marcia was was was uh interpreting for
[1:11:01] me and uh I just appreciate the Lord I
[1:11:03] give him all the glory give him all the
[1:11:06] praise amen because he knew what the
[1:11:08] people needed in that hour he knew what
[1:11:10] the people needed there in that
[1:11:11] congregation so uh the next day or later
[1:11:14] on this week this is a um I forgot the
[1:11:17] brother's name there from Brother Joseph
[1:11:19] is the the black brother there on the
[1:11:21] left he is a he's a pastor from um from
[1:11:24] uh Manchester
[1:11:26] uh England and he uh he was also brother
[1:11:29] Marcio had invited him to speak at the
[1:11:32] convention there later that week and um
[1:11:35] and so I got to meet Brother Joseph
[1:11:37] wonderful brother he knows brother Benny
[1:11:38] Perry and he's he's been to South
[1:11:40] Carolina brother Benny peries so he
[1:11:42] knows he knows them and um so got to
[1:11:46] meet them now this is at the convention
[1:11:49] and um this is I I I I had to interpret
[1:11:53] and also preach that the whole time and
[1:11:56] really wasn't going wasn't planning to
[1:11:59] to to to to interpret but uh I I had to
[1:12:03] interpret and uh and so we ministered
[1:12:06] there at the convention now the brother
[1:12:08] there in the middle uh this brother
[1:12:11] right here this is brother Lucas Cardona
[1:12:14] and he's from Honduras he's from
[1:12:17] Honduras and uh he was there as well
[1:12:20] because his son he has a little work uh
[1:12:22] in Spain uh a church that they started
[1:12:25] in Spain and so he was visiting at that
[1:12:27] time and so brother Marcio invited him
[1:12:29] to come and speak at the Convention as
[1:12:31] well so he was there and brother Aaron
[1:12:34] you know brother Lucas brother Aaron has
[1:12:36] spoke at brother Lucas's Church before
[1:12:38] there in Honduras when we went so so we
[1:12:41] were there had a good time let me tell
[1:12:42] you what there was people from from all
[1:12:45] parts of the of the world there uh I
[1:12:48] think there was probably let's say I
[1:12:50] don't know maybe 15 countries
[1:12:52] represented there and uh and so we had
[1:12:55] really good time amen it it turned out
[1:12:57] really really nice for being the first
[1:12:59] convention and it really motivated them
[1:13:01] to to do another one and I believe the
[1:13:03] next one it'll be even better amen so of
[1:13:07] course it it isn't Honduras and it isn't
[1:13:10] Nicaragua you can see it's a they rented
[1:13:12] out a nice little place for us to to
[1:13:14] speak at so it was a it was a change we
[1:13:17] weren't riding behind trucks with dust
[1:13:19] and gasoline all you know all over you
[1:13:21] know
[1:13:22] so it was nice to have a a different
[1:13:26] chain so um but we really had a good
[1:13:29] time with him this is uh two of brother

[1:17:24] didn't know that this happened here but
[1:17:27] some of you all did so uh there was a
[1:17:29] sister from Honduras who who contacted
[1:17:32] me because the uh brother margarito
[1:17:35] who's a pastor in Honduras contacted me
[1:17:38] and said hey there's a sister that lives
[1:17:39] in Alabama and and and she came to the
[1:17:42] Lord over the phone um and uh I led her
[1:17:46] to the Lord but she wants to get
[1:17:47] baptized she wants to she and she also
[1:17:50] wants to get married as well so um she
[1:17:55] she had been living with with her the
[1:17:57] man that she had been living with they
[1:17:58] have some kids together but she wanted
[1:18:02] to get that right make that right and
[1:18:04] she wanted to to get married and she
[1:18:06] wanted to get baptized as well so her
[1:18:09] husband agreed even though her husband
[1:18:11] isn't really serving the lord uh he he
[1:18:13] hasn't accepted the Lord yet but he
[1:18:16] agreed to get married and is not wasn't
[1:18:19] stopping her from getting baptized so
[1:18:21] here they are we came here on a Saturday
[1:18:23] actually at the day the last uh uh uh
[1:18:27] youth service that we had and uh brother
[1:18:31] Wade I asked brother Wade and brother
[1:18:32] Wade graciously agreed they drove four
[1:18:35] hours all the way from Alabama because
[1:18:36] there's no close where they live it's in
[1:18:39] I forgot Katherine Alabama there is no
[1:18:41] church near near them uh the closest is
[1:18:44] brother Matthew Bray and I think it's
[1:18:46] like two two and a half hours away so I
[1:18:50] just brother Wade said why don't you
[1:18:51] just tell them just to come over here
[1:18:53] we'll we'll baptize them we'll marry
[1:18:55] them uh all at the same time so I did
[1:18:58] and she accepted and she was very very
[1:19:00] very happy and so there was nobody here
[1:19:04] there was only just the person and their
[1:19:06] two kids the two of their kids that came
[1:19:09] the person that drove them was here and
[1:19:11] uh there were the witnesses we were
[1:19:13] Witnesses and I was interpreter and so
[1:19:15] we were able to marry them and she came
[1:19:17] in with her gown and everything and got
[1:19:19] baptized in the same gown as well so she
[1:19:22] was very very happy we still keep in
[1:19:24] touch with with her yeah and she's
[1:19:25] serving the lord she's uh she's asked
[1:19:28] asked me also to reach out to her sister
[1:19:30] who lives in Jacksonville Florida who
[1:19:33] who she wants also to come to the Lord
[1:19:35] as well so we've been able to lead
[1:19:37] brother uh uh uh we let gave her the
[1:19:39] address and the contact information of
[1:19:41] brother Ismael Maldonado down there in
[1:19:44] in in in Jacksonville Florida and she
[1:19:46] said that she was going to go to their
[1:19:47] church so you know it just it just makes
[1:19:51] me think you know we think about
[1:19:52] missions uh uh going home but see all
[1:19:55] these people are coming here now and so
[1:19:58] I get text messages all the time and
[1:20:00] WhatsApp people asking that where's the
[1:20:02] church that I can go to uh is there
[1:20:05] somewhere and and so I'm having to go

[1:20:08] church near this city is there a so
[1:20:11] we're having to actually do missions
[1:20:12] here within home you see and you might
[1:20:15] think oh well those those they don't
[1:20:16] need to be here they're coming in
[1:20:17] illegally they're here for a
[1:20:20] reason maybe this is where they come to
[1:20:22] the Lord right uh you know you don't you

[1:20:28] and you know they're not following the
[1:20:30] law God has he allows things for a
[1:20:33] reason do you know that I that's how I
[1:20:36] came to the
[1:20:37] Lord maybe I couldn't come to the Lord
