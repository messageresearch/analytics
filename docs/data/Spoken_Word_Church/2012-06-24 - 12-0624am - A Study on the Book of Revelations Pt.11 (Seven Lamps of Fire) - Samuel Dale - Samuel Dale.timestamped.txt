[11:41] that his brother was was doing better we
[11:44] appreciate the Lord being with his
[11:46] brother and taking care of him and pray
[11:48] that the Lord will will continue to make
[11:51] him well amen now I've noticed that by

[12:00] earlier then they're able to get out you
[12:03] know 10 minutes earlier and they're

[13:10] was a normal thing to lose weight during
[13:14] the type of operation you know that he
[13:16] had the open heart surgery or what you

[14:27] clean look at somebody look
[14:29] handkerchiefs yeah we have handkerchiefs
[14:31] we carry them in our pockets we carry
[14:33] them on our body cuz that's the way the
[14:35] Bible says for to do it then we bring it
[14:37] here and we preach over it we lay it
[14:38] down we cut it up make it into a prayer
[14:41] cloth so you know we've had to get some
[14:43] of those done today all right
[14:46] Revelations
[14:47] 3 excuse me Revelation
[14:50] 1 1 through 3 I told them three I guess
[14:54] they might have put it up okay they're
[14:55] doing better than I am I'm getting
[14:57] things messed up
[14:59] you to see us sometimes back there we
[15:00] walk in quotes and I come out handle ter
[15:02] I another hand another pass out to some
[15:04] of you that can't see good and we keep
[15:07] add-ons addons addons okay says the
[15:11] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[15:12] gave unto him to show unto his servant
[15:14] things which must shortly come to pass
[15:17] and he sent and signified it by his
[15:19] Angel unto his servant John who be
[15:22] record of the word of God and of the
[15:23] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[15:25] things that he saw blessed is he that
[15:28] than they that hear the words of this
[15:30] prophecy and keep those things which are
[15:33] written therein or the time is at hand
[15:37] you may be seated Lord at his Blessing
[15:40] to the reading of the
[15:46] word now we've been trying to
[15:52] uh you know cover some in the Book of
[15:55] Revelations and uh so just bear with us
[15:59] uh if it's not needful for you we'll
[16:02] bear with us to try to help others and
[16:06] you know uh ourselves to see the word of
[16:09] God and trying to speak on those things
[16:13] uh I heard just this week too that
[16:15] remember the I don't know about his
[16:17] family or whatever but remember brother
[16:19] lale passed away during this this past
[16:22] week either Friday Saturday or something
[16:26] but he was on up into his 90s and all
[16:29] but he went to be with the Lord so just
[16:31] remember the the family is there
[16:34] right
[16:37] now just kind of a little review because
[16:40] we try to do that on ever service just
[16:42] to back up a little to get it to me
[16:44] because you know it it just all ties
[16:47] together right well it's hard for me to
[16:50] stay here so you just jump in here and
[16:52] go on because I realize the human
[16:55] abilities of all of us that uh you know
[16:58] you know that it doesn't uh a lot of
[17:02] times we need the background of what it
[17:04] is and tie it together you know and uh
[17:07] you just didn't go to school one day and
[17:09] they said uh 1 + 1 is 2 the next day
[17:12] they said 2 + 2 is 4 the next day you
[17:14] know 4 + 4 is 8 they didn't do stuff
[17:17] like that you know they kept on with the
[17:20] 1 + 1 = 2 and they kept on until we got
[17:23] that right then they moved on up to you
[17:26] know uh 2 plus two right you know then
[17:29] that to you know it takes time in the
[17:31] understanding of the Gospel Amen to be
[17:34] able to follow the message especially to
[17:37] me in this book of
[17:38] Revelations because what is our whole
[17:42] point now the Book of Revelation shows
[17:45] it's the bride's book and it shows um
[17:49] never in a form of Jesus just standing
[17:51] somewhere by himself he's always with
[17:55] the bride you know or in Bride form
[17:57] right and and things like that and I
[18:00] hope that would would be better for us
[18:02] to understand and some that are on
[18:04] Internet that maybe have never heard
[18:06] these things then that would be a good
[18:08] thing to write down and then just read
[18:11] the book of Revelations yourself just
[18:13] read it over and over and over I invite
[18:14] you to because I that makes it you know
[18:17] a lot of people say well I wouldn't want
[18:18] to preach to people that that know you
[18:21] know as much as I do man even years ago
[18:24] told Brother Mo said if you give them
[18:25] them books they'll know what you know
[18:27] well that's what I want am I want you to
[18:30] know as much as I know then I don't have
[18:32] to spend so much time backgrounding I do
[18:34] enough as it is but I want you to study
[18:37] and and things and then that way you'll
[18:40] catch me if I miss it too all right but
[18:43] we covered now how that through the uh
[18:46] chapter 1 2 and three has been the basis
[18:50] of showing the church the bride of
[18:52] Christ as she's up on Earth and and her
[18:57] journey through and we'll pick back up
[18:58] in a minute in something with that maybe
[19:00] will help us but then we saw that the
[19:04] Rapture comes at the end of the seventh
[19:06] Church age as it's ending up the Rapture
[19:09] will come and the bride goes up in
[19:12] Revelations
[19:13] 4:1 and not seen until Revelations 19
[19:18] amen all right see that way the bride
[19:20] does not go through the tribulation we
[19:22] thank God for those things and I just
[19:25] gave these to quote to not to put up on
[19:28] the screen but brother brandham says in
[19:31] Revelations uh G paragraph 24 revelation
[19:34] of Jesus Christ that the church goes up
[19:37] in Revelations 4 and not seen until
[19:40] Revelations 19 and then it's Israel from
[19:42] then on you say well that was in his
[19:44] early Ministry I put this in because
[19:47] people out there are listening and they
[19:48] got their doctrines and ideas you know
[19:50] and some people believe that brother
[19:52] Brandon preached this and then he
[19:53] changed here you know Etc well uh that
[19:57] would have been 19 1960 and uh 12:04
[20:01] 1960 the morning service well then he
[20:04] comes over to Feast of the trumpets that
[20:06] we gave to you preached in
[20:08] 1964 uh
[20:10] 719 and he covered how the the bride the
[20:13] church as he calls it the bride goes up
[20:16] in Revelations uh 4 and not seen until
[20:19] Revelations 19 all right so then we know
[20:24] that this is not
[20:27] covering
[20:28] as we're reading in the Book of
[20:30] Revelations we went over to the fourth
[20:32] chapter basically bypassing the church
[20:34] ages because that's
[20:36] self-explanatory and the message was
[20:38] given to them and then John is taken up
[20:40] in Revelations 4:1 as a type amen of the
[20:46] Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ now
[20:50] watch that in a
[20:52] minute I want to deal with it today in
[20:55] your mind while you're uh conscious not
[20:58] asleep listening to me this will be the
[21:01] point of today is to see that you know
[21:06] the bride going up in Revelations 4:1
[21:09] she's not seen until Revelations 19 all
[21:12] right see people say but what about 107
[21:14] what about this well we've covered those
[21:16] things I don't have the time to go into
[21:18] it uh but you go back and listen you can
[21:21] find it all right and then in covering
[21:24] it the we
[21:26] are not not a type no absolutely now
[21:30] Revelations 4:1 now listen to what I'm
[21:33] saying John goes up as a type y right
[21:37] all right and he sees what he sees okay
[21:41] but now Revelation 4:1 is not a typ amen
[21:45] that's right it's a reality amen that's
[21:47] right it's a literal position amen we'll
[21:50] repeat this in a minute over and over to
[21:52] you because that's what I want you to
[21:53] see that it's not a
[21:55] type then we'll get into Ezekiel and see
[21:59] that you can see the journey down
[22:00] through time of Israel and in the church
[22:03] ages right but then John when he goes up
[22:06] it's not a a journey it's a set position
[22:09] the prophet calls it all right so then I
[22:11] want that into your mind as you're
[22:13] thinking along with me to think about
[22:17] that what John is seeing now is the
[22:19] Bride of Jesus Christ after the Rapture
[22:23] amen yes not a top of the Rapture right
[22:27] amen if it's a top of the Rapture it
[22:29] just means something like uh you're
[22:32] going to be amazed in a minute maybe
[22:34] when I get to it I'll go ahead and make
[22:36] a statement and then you consider it uh
[22:39] when you're dealing with an Earthly
[22:41] Journey on Earth you can be dealing with
[22:45] cherubims
[22:46] fine but reality in real the real thing
[22:50] is that you're not dealing with geram
[22:52] you're dealing with reality amen all
[22:55] right when you see it in heaven in a
[22:57] heavenly scenes you can deal with
[23:00] cherubims right Angels Z right because
[23:05] we'll find out and have been trying to
[23:07] study that even like what was it we went
[23:10] through it uh of the 24
[23:13] Elders see we went through that you know
[23:16] bringing in chapter 4 there the 24
[23:18] Elders is the 12 apostles and the 12
[23:21] Patriarchs that's from from U
[23:24] Revelations chapter
[23:26] 4 and then on down he even brother
[23:30] randam that was paragraph 74 then on
[23:32] down to paragraph 293 brother randam
[23:35] even said who is this and he calls it
[23:37] and says it is the 12 apostles 12
[23:40] Patriarchs there's your 24 Elders all
[23:44] right now they are round about the
[23:46] throne and I wish you would read that
[23:49] carefully in in each one of your
[23:51] readings and you'll find these beasts
[23:53] when we get to them later you'll find
[23:55] that it'll say they're in the midst
[23:57] right Amen in like Revelations 1 shows
[24:01] him standing in the midst of the seven
[24:03] golden Candlestick amen and see people
[24:06] the people as I said they'll say well he
[24:08] was in the first church age but he
[24:10] wasn't in until the last Church age you
[24:11] know well then you've missed the whole
[24:13] Bible you miss what we'll talk about in
[24:16] a minute the seven spirits of God you
[24:18] miss all of those things trying to make
[24:20] some uh super duper Revelation that
[24:23] attracts the attention of the people
[24:26] right you know all right see then we
[24:28] don't need Super Duper all Revelation is
[24:31] super duper but if it's true Revelation
[24:34] now if it's Satan's they ain't too much
[24:36] super about it it ain't too much duper
[24:37] about it I don't know what that means
[24:39] but it just don't mean nothing to me all
[24:42] right now but then we went from that
[24:46] part of the 24
[24:49] elders and we picked up that to show
[24:52] that this 24 Elders being I said the 12
[24:55] apostles the 12 Patriarchs that's right
[24:57] all right the 12 apostles would cover
[24:59] the church ages right right the 12 12
[25:02] Patriarchs would be covering the Old
[25:05] Testament uh bride of Jehovah whatever
[25:08] you want to call it uh you know the
[25:11] people of Israel and and their doings
[25:14] and and things like that and and it goes
[25:17] up and then we discovered that it jumps
[25:20] there from the scene of seeing the 24
[25:23] Elders that it jumps to the point of
[25:26] seeing that this was a Throne of
[25:28] judgment right all right that was that
[25:32] was in our Liv kind of the message about
[25:34] verse 5 see that it turns into a throne
[25:37] of judgment not mercy so it goes to the
[25:41] white Throne judgment right so you got a
[25:43] vast gap between even the bases of John
[25:47] covering the 24 Elders covering the
[25:49] throne the one you know the the the one
[25:51] on the throne the different things and
[25:53] then jumping over there's a vast gap
[25:56] which covers all all of the Israel and
[26:00] everything you know and shows where they
[26:01] come in the Redemption and you wind up
[26:03] at White thr own judgment with this
[26:06] basis that you're seeing it all right
[26:09] now so we gave you those quotes from uh
[26:12] like Revelation chapter 4 uh paragraph
[26:16] 167 don't pull these up brother just
[26:18] jump on down we'll pick you up in a
[26:20] minute we'll get down to number seven
[26:22] all right and brother random talks about
[26:24] said this is not a throne of Mercy this
[26:27] is a throne of judgment he said you can
[26:29] scream all you want to at a throne of
[26:32] judgment he says there's no
[26:35] mercy all see now you just stand there
[26:39] as is all right then he goes to
[26:41] paragraph 307 chap Revelation 4 we read
[26:44] these over and over he said that's the
[26:46] bride of Christ sitting on his throne
[26:50] amen now sitting on the father's Throne
[26:53] yeah you remember that yes man now where
[26:57] where did the Father Strong
[27:00] start
[27:01] right all right now follow this point
[27:06] and you you'll catching what I'm trying
[27:08] to talk
[27:09] about if that is the Father Strong and
[27:12] brother R said it was we haven't got to
[27:15] that cuz that fulfill you know
[27:16] Revelations 3 21 or what it is where he
[27:20] said sit with me in my Throne as I've
[27:21] overcome s with my father and he is
[27:23] strong that's right see right now
[27:25] Jesus's Throne is not in existence here
[27:27] strong comes into
[27:29] existence right to the bases of where
[27:32] the Rapture would take place and we
[27:34] would be heading from there on through
[27:37] with the bride of Jesus Christ you can
[27:38] talk about his throne right really his
[27:41] throne is a millennial Reign amen right
[27:44] cuz he's promised the son of David to
[27:45] sit on his throne in the millennial
[27:47] Reign you'll understand when we get to
[27:49] it why I said tying right into the
[27:51] Rapture and going up because once we go
[27:54] up what does it matter where we go we're
[27:55] in eternity amen amen and see then it
[27:58] all will be made manifest but getting it
[28:00] right to the point see then that what
[28:03] we're looking at is the Father Strong
[28:06] right all right now I want to ask you a
[28:10] question cuz there's a lot today I want
[28:12] to deal with and and I just move as I
[28:15] can I write down as much as I can but I
[28:18] I I I just kind of wait to see what
[28:21] happens here
[28:24] and if I told you what happened about 2
[28:26] weeks ago you
[28:28] you would probably say well oh okay but
[28:31] I didn't okay I really saw something cuz
[28:34] I was wondering where to go I write down
[28:37] notes you notice lately though all I've
[28:40] got is
[28:41] quotes very few notes I just write the
[28:45] quotes put them down and I'm trying to
[28:48] go from that to one to the other and you
[28:51] know I had a gap in where I was fixing
[28:53] to go and I couldn't figure out how to
[28:56] get there so I said look at I'll just
[28:57] preach I get there right right I mean
[29:00] I'll just preach up to it if I don't get
[29:01] there I'll just cut it off start another
[29:03] service I don't bother me I've done that
[29:05] over 40 years now that I may do that it
[29:08] may be 20 years before I start it back
[29:10] up again you know on that point but that
[29:13] doesn't bother me I don't have no
[29:15] problem I just I'm not just going to
[29:16] make that step just because I think I
[29:19] know what's going on I'm going to be
[29:21] able to tie into the prophet's message
[29:24] and the Bible where I'm not going to
[29:25] bring it out that's just the the best
[29:27] way all right so then the Bride of Jesus
[29:29] Christ sitting on his throne now see
[29:33] we're not just around the throne that's
[29:34] what my point is you you talk about a
[29:37] throne and then you put around the
[29:40] throne well remember you you better be
[29:43] able to at least put 12 of those
[29:45] Elders to sitting on the throne because
[29:48] that is the bride of Christ right it's
[29:50] the apostles down to the church you know
[29:52] in 12 Apostles right now so you'd have
[29:55] to be able to at at least TI that much
[29:59] into and I I caution you to read it
[30:01] always say in the midst right amen well
[30:05] see how could you draw
[30:08] it h how could you draw even seven
[30:11] golden Candlestick and him in the
[30:15] midst i' like to see that drawn
[30:18] out because you're going to put more of
[30:20] it in here then you put over here or
[30:24] something see because you'd have to draw
[30:26] the whole entire thing and you have to
[30:28] have it him draw over the top of all of
[30:30] it right but it's in the midst it means
[30:33] he's just as prevalent he Hebrews 138
[30:36] he's the same in every age amen that's
[30:38] right so it don't mean that he was great
[30:40] in the first age and not too great in
[30:43] the middle and then become great and the
[30:44] end no that's his
[30:46] ministry the ministry that was back
[30:49] there and then coming over here to the
[30:50] ministry being restored again all right
[30:55] see then you would come to the Alpha and
[30:56] Omega to understand amen and you'd see
[30:59] that he is all in between amen all right
[31:02] but the main thing of what we're trying
[31:04] to see is the bride is sitting in the
[31:07] throne with him amen yes right not just
[31:12] sitting on the throne right be pretty
[31:15] crowded Throne you be a big old Throne I
[31:18] don't make it a joke I make it as plain
[31:23] sense but to see him
[31:26] in
[31:28] Christ being the
[31:30] throne the father's Throne right all
[31:33] right to see all of that and then to
[31:34] look and see us
[31:36] there that's just showing us where we're
[31:39] at we're what we're nothing without
[31:42] him right if it's anything what he done
[31:46] B said it is he that brother spoke on
[31:48] that years ago it is he that ha made us
[31:50] and not we ourselves we as people in the
[31:52] Sheep of his pasture
[31:55] y see then in that Throne is where we're
[31:59] sitting all right but now I want to ask
[32:02] you a simple
[32:04] question okay everybody ready simple I
[32:06] love
[32:07] questions amen the Bible says questions
[32:10] gender
[32:12] stri the prophet said questions makes a
[32:15] strong church now which one you're going
[32:18] to deal
[32:19] with I know questions that are tripal
[32:23] questions they ask Jesus questions to
[32:26] trap him those gender
[32:29] Strife but when they said over there
[32:33] would you explain this to us what does
[32:36] these Parables mean that was not a
[32:39] genderist argument what you call it that
[32:41] was not an argument that was him
[32:44] breaking it down to them because they'd
[32:46] asked him a simple question right amen
[32:48] see so then questions makes a strong
[32:51] church amen why because if we ask
[32:53] questions brother R said the question
[32:56] don't come first
[32:57] first the answer comes first then the
[33:00] question Falls to Earth all right now
[33:03] but what I want you to look at
[33:05] today now we're not talking about God's
[33:08] mind so don't get into God's mind with
[33:09] me don't get up here with God's mind he
[33:11] saw this and he saw that in his mind
[33:14] just just stay with me to get a point
[33:16] all
[33:17] right now did the throne in heaven
[33:19] develop Before the Throne on Earth
[33:21] developed in the heart of
[33:25] man
[33:28] well it's all same time now you talking
[33:30] about the mind of
[33:34] God now remember when John saw this was
[33:39] about ad 95
[33:41] 96 right right all
[33:44] right brother random in the seal book
[33:46] said we're seeing what happened in glory
[33:48] about 2,000 years
[33:52] ago so John on Patman ad 95 and 96 he's
[33:57] taken up into the future
[34:02] yes and he might not have comprehended
[34:05] totally what was going on so he gave us
[34:07] the types and the Shadows you know the
[34:10] symbols
[34:13] all but
[34:19] remember the kingdom had already come
[34:21] into the heart of John or he couldn't go
[34:23] to heaven to see
[34:25] anything Paul wouldn't takeen up to the
[34:28] third heaven while he was over there
[34:30] killing all of them
[34:32] Christians that's right come on get your
[34:34] story
[34:36] right is after Paul become converted
[34:39] could he be taken that's right it was
[34:41] after John become
[34:44] converted the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[34:47] that's right on the day of Pentecost
[34:48] could he be able to be taken right and
[34:51] notice too God didn't
[34:53] take some of the others that were not
[34:56] listed as the The Upper Room
[35:00] experience right right cuz God don't use
[35:03] a novice you know a baby a child in the
[35:06] gospel to write his gospel because don't
[35:08] know how to
[35:10] write right he uses somebody that's
[35:12] anchored right look like he to use Peter
[35:16] because Jesus is speaking a lot of times
[35:19] up to Peter but Jesus never has to
[35:21] rebuke
[35:24] John we'll get into one of the days with
[35:27] the lon the ox the man the eagle Etc and
[35:30] you can go through your Matthew Mark
[35:31] Luke and John sure see Matthew would be
[35:35] the line Mark is the ox because of the
[35:38] symbolics Through The Book of Mark Y and
[35:40] then Luke being a wisdom smart man is
[35:43] the the man and then John is the eagle
[35:46] if you want to go prophetic go read the
[35:47] book of John that's right it's more
[35:49] prophetic than the other gospels and
[35:52] then he's chosen to go up and write the
[35:55] Book of Revelation amen Matthew Mark and
[35:57] Luke was a
[35:58] chosen John was chosen all right so get
[36:01] the point now what we're trying to
[36:05] bring so then John is not seeing
[36:08] something
[36:10] new John knows what has happened on
[36:14] Earth let said maybe he understand all
[36:16] of it that's all right
[36:21] right but
[36:22] yet the father is
[36:25] strong I've kept on that and over it to
[36:28] make sure it stays in your mind the
[36:31] Father Strong was the baptism of the
[36:33] Holy Ghost that came on day Pentecost
[36:35] right now I've read that to you showed
[36:38] it to you through the message the Father
[36:40] Strong was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:43] right they come on the day of Pentecost
[36:45] amen that's why Jesus said you'll sit
[36:47] with me and my as I have overcome and
[36:49] sit with my father see he went straight
[36:51] up on the throne with what happened the
[36:53] Holy Ghost came back to start on the
[36:55] church here amen
[36:57] and identically the same thing as what
[36:59] would be there all right so now what
[37:01] you're looking
[37:04] at if you look at it correctly you'll
[37:06] look at the church ages and see that God
[37:09] has been traveling down through the
[37:11] church ages sure
[37:14] amen all right he's been in
[37:18] travel right all right now in doing that
[37:22] you'll see
[37:25] that
[37:29] the Throne of God began in the heart of
[37:32] man right
[37:34] amen the father's Throne began on the
[37:37] day of Pentecost in the heart of man
[37:39] that's right all right
[37:42] now sure we look at the positive look at
[37:45] the partial realization compared to
[37:47] perfect realization right okay fine and
[37:50] you can say well John went up and saw
[37:52] but what did John go up and
[37:55] see John went up and saw what would take
[37:59] place during the
[38:02] ages sure of the baptism of the Holy
[38:05] Ghost right amen right y simple John
[38:08] went up and saw what would happen on the
[38:11] Earth right through the ages all right
[38:14] now in doing that then see we better get
[38:17] our minds down here to where we're at
[38:22] right
[38:23] amen I've preached before to you and you
[38:25] know it we got to match what there yes
[38:27] that's true but if if you just keep your
[38:30] eyes on what's there and don't see
[38:32] what's
[38:34] here I'm sorry there's not much to go to
[38:37] there if that's all you can do that's so
[38:40] let's deal with what we deal here on
[38:42] Earth to see that God started his
[38:45] kingdom in on Earth in the soul of
[38:50] mankind and then when this is completed
[38:52] on
[38:55] earth when when this new birth this
[38:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost this statute
[38:59] of a perfect man adoption Etc the things
[39:02] the prophet spoke of that Jesus Christ
[39:05] become invisible Among Us Etc amen all
[39:09] right then there could be a
[39:13] Rapture as I said won't be a type
[39:18] right if you ain't careful you'll be
[39:20] typing something yeah that's
[39:23] right we're not a Tope of the new birth
[39:26] right amen we have the new birth amen
[39:30] we're not a type of eternal life we have
[39:32] eternal life
[39:36] amen your soul is just as Eternal y as
[39:40] it'll ever be by the new birth that's
[39:42] right the body and spirit yes is waiting
[39:44] for that to be done and that's what he's
[39:46] working on that's right all
[39:49] right but get that in your mind and and
[39:51] keep it
[39:54] there see we look over there and we see
[39:57] something but remember now that can't be
[40:01] there unless this is here
[40:05] right you
[40:09] know and it it means it has to take
[40:12] place that's right on
[40:14] Earth I was thinking this week because
[40:16] that's what I try to do just let my mind
[40:18] maybe you know I know what to is I don't
[40:20] mind of devil's workshop guess that's
[40:22] right but mine's not in
[40:25] Walmart is still in the bean field doing
[40:29] something you know taking care of the
[40:31] cattle or horses or
[40:33] something all
[40:35] right see I like to just think about
[40:38] where we're at and what we're
[40:40] doing what does all this mean to
[40:43] us there's no need of preaching what we
[40:46] will
[40:47] be until we realize what we
[40:50] are that's right when we realize what we
[40:53] are then we can think about what we will
[40:55] be but don't worry about it when we
[40:57] realize what we are we will be
[40:59] right because that's that's what's
[41:01] taking place that's right all right so
[41:04] then looking at it as seeing it see when
[41:09] Redemption is finally over
[41:14] here now I'm asking you a simple
[41:17] question to get a simple
[41:20] answer are we trying to go to
[41:25] heaven are we trying to bring Heaven
[41:27] here that's right right now I've said
[41:31] this over and over and over about 8,432
[41:34] times I
[41:35] again we spent 6,000 years trying to
[41:38] prove there's a God in heaven he spent
[41:40] 6,000 years trying to prove he's down
[41:43] here all right there is a heaven right
[41:46] we believe in it there's a bride there's
[41:48] a Rapture there will be a heaven to go
[41:50] to yes but if that heaven is not in
[41:53] reality here upon Earth in the bride
[41:56] Jesus Christ there is no heaven to go to
[41:59] that's right so we are actually
[42:03] building when Jesus said I go to prepare
[42:06] a place for you he said in my father's
[42:08] house are many mansions said that's old
[42:10] that's new birth right all right he said
[42:13] I go to prepare a place for you where
[42:15] did he go he ain't up there with hammers
[42:18] and Nails another bodies up there but he
[42:22] went up come right back down into the
[42:23] heart preparing you and I right we're
[42:27] going to identically match that
[42:29] City or we don't go to the city that's
[42:31] right that's all I'm trying to get us to
[42:33] see here that's right but we're going to
[42:35] match the city Here Am amen that's
[42:38] right this is not one of those things
[42:40] boy it's going to be great when we get
[42:41] dark cuz really going to change things
[42:44] that's been our idea for 2,000 years in
[42:48] Christianity trying to make those things
[42:50] come to pass won't work why don't we
[42:53] just settle down and realize
[42:57] God is right here working on you and
[43:01] I one day we will go there that's right
[43:07] amen but see our problem is we want to
[43:10] try to think about oursel already being
[43:12] there
[43:15] yes we won't be there until the Rapture
[43:17] comes remember John was a type of the
[43:21] Rapture right not a type
[43:25] of 2,000 years before Rapture right it
[43:28] was the top of the Rapture he went up
[43:31] that's right but see one day we don't
[43:33] have we can't type it we're going to
[43:35] have to go up right but to do that it's
[43:38] going to have to match here
[43:39] exactly
[43:42] amen that's why the new birth is the
[43:44] most important thing in your life amen
[43:46] that's
[43:49] right see then we're not going to have a
[43:51] state of of appeal when we get di you
[43:53] know
[43:55] right
[43:56] it's going to be here right that's what
[44:00] I told you years ago and I may be the
[44:01] next one to pass on but I told you this
[44:04] 30 years ago and I don't have to back up
[44:07] probably might even be
[44:09] 40 said most of the people in this
[44:11] message are not going to be able to
[44:13] stand there for that last moment to be
[44:14] changed in a moment the twinkl of an eye
[44:17] so we're going by the grave that's right
[44:20] and we have to be what brother dick says
[44:22] come down to that basis of being waiting
[44:24] on somebody else y we might be standing
[44:27] here and them waiting on us but we die
[44:30] we're there waiting on somebody else to
[44:32] pull us
[44:34] out you say well old age is to do it n
[44:37] God's let people live 150 years old
[44:39] there's people in the world to they 114
[44:41] or the oldest one like 114 I believe
[44:45] that's right you know that' be long ways
[44:49] for
[44:50] me but now listen
[44:53] Church what we want to do is see we we
[44:56] come up in the message and we heard it
[44:58] because we never we never thought about
[45:00] these things uh until we come in the
[45:02] message and then when we did we begin to
[45:05] look up and see something and that was
[45:09] wonderful but why not deal with where
[45:12] we're at that's
[45:15] right we not be concerned with where we
[45:17] are here that's right
[45:21] see and then you'll see that John T the
[45:25] rapture
[45:27] mhm now can I make a quote that is not a
[45:30] quote of brother
[45:33] randoms not only did John type the
[45:36] change of the body into going forth you
[45:39] know the things he just called a Rapture
[45:41] the prophet doesn't use it as a change
[45:43] of the body he uses it as a translation
[45:45] or
[45:46] something but you know that John was
[45:48] also a type of ever believer down
[45:50] through the age sure
[45:53] absolutely are you with me
[45:56] yes John was the type of every believer
[46:00] that will ever go in the r that's right
[46:01] that's
[46:03] right now don't try to find that brother
[46:06] R is that's a Dale quote okay and I
[46:09] don't mind saying it but sure doesn't
[46:11] sound good to
[46:13] me because if not you just got John
[46:16] toping one thing no you top of all the
[46:20] bride in her journey down through time
[46:22] and then her journey up to the point of
[46:24] being changed
[46:26] that's why he had to have the man like
[46:27] he did to do it okay now so think about
[46:31] it when Redemption is
[46:34] over the Throne of God on earth and the
[46:37] heart of man will be
[46:40] identically the same
[46:44] position here on
[46:47] Earth as it is there in glory amen
[46:50] that's right all right no problems right
[46:53] that's right now
[46:58] so let's get to something cuz this is
[47:00] going to happen for the next two or
[47:02] three
[47:04] messages
[47:06] now let's read number seven brothers in
[47:09] the quotes CU I told him I said this
[47:12] evening but it's going to be worse than
[47:15] ever we're going to read the entire book
[47:18] of the entire fifth seal this afternoon
[47:21] you going to read off the screen but not
[47:23] all of it we w't take that long okay
[47:26] but look what your Prophet has to say
[47:29] here because we come up we better read
[47:32] that to where we can TI all together so
[47:35] let's read number let's read
[47:37] verse
[47:40] uh five of Revelations 4 verse 5 and out
[47:45] of the throne proceeded lightning
[47:46] thunderings and voices and there were
[47:48] seven lamps of fire burning Before the
[47:52] Throne which are the seven spirits all
[47:55] right
[47:57] now we will be back to Ezekiel in a
[48:00] minute to pick that up to match it but I
[48:02] want to approach it in a way to where
[48:05] that you can understand what I'm trying
[48:07] to
[48:08] say about these
[48:11] lampstands we could go through all of
[48:13] the story of it but what does the
[48:15] prophet have to say this is taken
[48:17] Revelation if I was you I'd read L
[48:20] Revelation CH 4 there's about four parts
[48:24] of it this separ book a separate books
[48:27] all
[48:28] right now this is where 61101 Revelation
[48:33] 4 part two reflecting the light of God
[48:36] into the church now he's talking about
[48:38] the burning Before the Throne which are
[48:40] the seven spirits of God now we know
[48:42] there's not seven spirits of God we
[48:44] won't have to try to deal with that as
[48:45] much but we will be dealing with it in
[48:47] here because there's not seven spirits
[48:49] of God it's the spirit of God in
[48:52] seven Messengers bringing it but it's
[48:54] really the spirit of God in seven Church
[48:56] age people bringing forth God and
[48:59] brother brand said it's not seven
[49:02] spirits no more than Paul when he covers
[49:05] the uh the uh works and the and the
[49:09] spirit and a different thing you know
[49:11] the manifestation there in Corinthians
[49:13] right it's all of the Same Spirit that's
[49:15] right right so it's not seven
[49:18] spirits reflecting the light of God into
[49:20] the church right straight from the
[49:22] Throne of God not through a seminary not
[49:25] through some Bishop but from the Throne
[49:28] of God yep now
[49:32] remember right remember the other day
[49:34] when I was trying to preach on it when I
[49:36] said that I was certainly glad that over
[49:38] in the Bible L that it didn't say that
[49:41] when uh who was it um my goodness uh
[49:47] laid down and he saw the
[49:49] throne open and Jacob all right and the
[49:54] Angels were ascending and descending
[49:57] right it doesn't say descending and
[49:59] ascending right that's totally reverse
[50:01] this thing's not that way this thing is
[50:03] here right right all right the Angels
[50:05] were going from Jacob taking his
[50:07] offering up to God and then bringing
[50:09] back the rewards to Jacob right so keep
[50:12] that in your mind what you're talking
[50:14] about so he's talking about the light of
[50:15] the reflecting
[50:17] here where from but from the Throne of
[50:21] God how by a revelation of the power of
[50:25] His
[50:27] Resurrection making him the same
[50:29] yesterday today and forever and the
[50:30] Seven Stars standing there reflecting
[50:32] that light the sh kind of light from
[50:34] this sh kind of Glory from the holiest
[50:36] of holy seven lamps on fire sitting on
[50:40] top of these candlesticks reflecting the
[50:42] light his colors of his power of his
[50:45] resurrection right into the church now
[50:47] you know what EAS that's you got you
[50:49] candlesticks and then you got the light
[50:51] of each one you know how each one was
[50:53] lit it was originally lit from the the
[50:56] alar of God and then you let number one
[50:58] then you would like number two from
[51:00] number one and number three from number
[51:01] two Etc coming all down CU it all from
[51:03] the sign right all right now
[51:06] watching we won't be over with our
[51:08] dealing with the beast but I've got to
[51:09] get this to you where you'll see
[51:12] it then he covers the scripture Before
[51:14] the Throne there was sh of life like
[51:15] under crystal in the midst of the throne
[51:18] and round about now
[51:21] remember in the midst of and round about
[51:24] now draw that for me
[51:26] how can something be in the midst and a
[51:31] roundabout it's just all there it's not
[51:34] the whole thing's
[51:36] him if he's in the midst of it it's just
[51:38] everything there him whether it's round
[51:40] about or the throne or whatever it is
[51:42] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[51:45] and it's right here in our
[51:47] hearts is where all of this is taking
[51:49] place huh he said well how can you get
[51:52] all them beast and them 24
[51:54] hours remember your
[51:57] salvation whether you want to agree or
[51:59] not came from the Jews because they
[52:03] turned it down so the 24 Elders the 12
[52:07] of Patriarchs brought the Salvation to
[52:10] us the 12 apostles is telling us about
[52:13] the salvation that's right see so it's
[52:17] it's it's all revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:19] where he's at he's right here in you and
[52:20] me right all right that's what all this
[52:24] is talking about seea of glass and
[52:26] crystal in the midst of the throne round
[52:27] about The Throne or four beasts full of
[52:29] eyes before and behind all right now
[52:31] remember we're dealing with
[52:33] lamps LS all right but watch and he goes
[52:38] ahead and he begins to give this these
[52:42] Beast now see you're going to have to
[52:46] tie it together while I'm using the the
[52:49] the lampstands the things together with
[52:51] the because the lampstands and all of
[52:54] these things is a church right right all
[52:57] right now he's covering beast but look
[52:59] what he's tying it back to he's already
[53:01] brought the reflecting of the light of
[53:03] the shine of Glory now he come what and
[53:05] he goes ahead and he begins to give this
[53:08] these beasts the same thing Ezekiel Saw
[53:12] y them
[53:15] guards one like a manand one like a lion
[53:18] one like a eagle what was it now watch
[53:21] when we bring them in and show that L of
[53:24] the tribe of Judah

[53:27] their tribes that sat on four walls Y
[53:31] and they were guarding this mercy seat
[53:33] oh what a
[53:34] picture I just there's great days
[53:38] ahead
[53:41] now let's go to
[53:44] Ezekiel when he said
[53:47] Ezekiel the same thing Ezekiel Saw right

[53:54] lampstands candlesticks everything but
[53:57] Ezekiel sees it the same
[54:03] thing are you with me Ezekiel sees the
[54:06] same thing go ahead and pull up Ezekiel
[54:10] now and
[54:12] look all right I just chose 4 through6
[54:16] you need to read the whole thing
[54:19] right and I looked and behold a
[54:21] whirlwind came out of the North a great
[54:24] cloud and a fire unfolding infolding I
[54:26] like that too it said not unfolding it's
[54:30] infolding it's coming Inward and the
[54:33] brightness was about it this Holy Ghost
[54:36] In Me can go out that way but I love for
[54:37] it to come this way you know I enjoy it
[54:41] trying to help you but I enjoy it coming
[54:43] this way right I enjoy the infolding and
[54:46] the brightness was about it out of the
[54:48] midst thereof was a color of amber out
[54:50] of the midst of the fire now let's steal
[54:52] the lamp right stand set fire all right
[54:56] also out of the midst thereof came the
[54:57] likeness of four living creatures and
[54:59] this was their appearance they had the
[55:00] likeness of a man and everyone had four
[55:03] faces and everyone had four
[55:05] wings it was likeness of a man in other
[55:08] words it it was upright it was doing it
[55:10] was you know wouldn't likeness of a
[55:13] beast or a cow or a horse or you it ties
[55:17] together with the baptism of the Holy
[55:18] Ghost here all right and everyone had
[55:21] four faces and everyone had four wings
[55:23] and their feet were straight feet and
[55:24] the soul to their feet was like the so
[55:26] of the cast foot and they sparkled like
[55:28] the color of of the color of burned
[55:32] burnished Bry
[55:36] raise and they had the hands of a man
[55:38] under their wings on their four sides
[55:41] and they had their faces and their
[55:44] wings their wings were joined one to
[55:46] another they turned not when they
[55:49] went they went everyone straight forward
[55:53] now draw that
[55:55] four of
[55:57] them each one looking in different
[56:00] directions and they're going
[56:02] straight yep each one of us going
[56:05] straight ahead y right you explain
[56:10] drawing the further they go the further
[56:12] away they
[56:14] get all right we going to see what that
[56:16] all
[56:18] means and for the likes their face they
[56:20] had the face of a
[56:22] man the face of a lion on the right side
[56:25] and they four had the face of an ox on
[56:28] the left side and they four also had the
[56:30] face of an eagle so there's you line the
[56:32] ox the man The Eagle right now
[56:35] watch thus were their faces and their
[56:38] wings were stretched upward two Wings
[56:41] all right to save all of the reading
[56:44] drop it on down to the 16th where we'll
[56:46] see what it is and everybody ought to
[56:48] know this verse of what it is
[56:51] what and the appearance of the wheels
[56:54] now these living living creatures
[56:56] they're moving
[56:58] right but look what it is and the
[57:00] appearance of the wheels and their Works
[57:02] was like unto the color of burl and they
[57:05] four had one likeness and their
[57:07] appearance and their work was as it were
[57:09] a wheel in the middle of the wheel all
[57:13] everybody knows the song wheel in the
[57:15] middle of the
[57:18] wheel what is it the Little Wheel runs
[57:21] by faith the big wheel runs by the word
[57:23] of God wheel in the meal wheel way in
[57:25] the middle of the a now do you know what
[57:27] that
[57:32] means do you know what it means of the
[57:34] wheel in the middle of the
[57:37] wheel some are saying yes and some are
[57:39] saying no and some are saying I don't
[57:44] know see it's got two
[57:49] things Ezekiel is describing two things
[57:52] y That's
[57:53] Right
[57:57] the wheel in the middle of the wheel is
[57:58] Jesus Christ we know that simple right
[58:01] and you put it in the heart of man it's
[58:03] in the new world simple right all right
[58:06] but he's describing what's taking
[58:11] place now I want to read this to you in
[58:13] a
[58:15] second he's describing what's taking
[58:17] place
[58:19] y all right now you got all these beasts
[58:23] you got all these things and you know
[58:25] what that all means when Ezekiel first
[58:27] saw
[58:28] it he's describing two things he's
[58:30] describing Israel and he's going to
[58:32] describe the bride so we're going to get
[58:33] both of them right okay that's right
[58:35] Ezekiel is
[58:38] describing the wheel in the middle of
[58:40] the
[58:42] wheel the Beast the
[58:45] doings you know what that
[58:48] is that's Israel in their Journey
[58:52] Through the
[58:53] wilderness right now we're going to read
[58:55] where the Prophet says just a minute
[58:58] right so all these symbols and all these
[59:01] things what is it it's Israel and their
[59:04] Journey right I remember when I first
[59:07] read that I used to read that and wonder
[59:09] what it is don't we all try to figure
[59:11] out that wheel in the middle of the
[59:12] wheel way in the middle of the a you
[59:13] know we' all say well that was Jesus
[59:15] Christ we could figure those things out
[59:17] a little bit but we couldn't figure out
[59:19] why all these combat beasts and all
[59:21] these appears and what they was doing
[59:22] and all that well that's just symbols
[59:24] that we don't understand hand when that
[59:26] Prophet said it that's right he said
[59:28] that's Israel in their travel
[59:33] yep I shout
[59:37] it cuz I knew it was Christ in Israel
[59:39] and all of their Journey right I could
[59:42] read
[59:44] that not Jesus the flesh Christ was
[59:47] there Amen to lead the children of
[59:48] Israel is the pillar of fire of the
[59:50] things that were there and there to be
[59:52] with each one of those men that would
[59:54] conquer ations Etc and things that
[59:56] happen it was Israel under their
[1:00:01] Journey let's just read
[1:00:04] that go ahead
[1:00:06] with I didn't give them a number I gave
[1:00:09] some of you s but go to Revelations 4
[1:00:12] part
[1:00:15] 3 and let's just read this and there you
[1:00:18] living creatures there's your Ezekiel
[1:00:20] that we just read that's what he's
[1:00:21] reading coming down Ezekiel okay now
[1:00:24] he's going to explain
[1:00:26] it he said what's the symbol there
[1:00:30] what's the symbol here brother Ram what
[1:00:32] is it it means that these
[1:00:35] guards these guards was God's
[1:00:39] Ark they were in
[1:00:42] Journey Rolling On
[1:00:46] Wheels when Ezekiel Saw
[1:00:53] them Rolling On Wheels the Journey of
[1:00:56] Israel was what Ezekiel was
[1:01:01] describing right now look they were in
[1:01:04] Journey Rolling On Wheels when Ezekiel
[1:01:06] Saw but when John saw
[1:01:09] them watch you they had already come
[1:01:12] into their right position in heaven
[1:01:15] 41 or four really four
[1:01:21] five the Ark of God was on Earth
[1:01:25] Rolling On Wheels yep as they took it
[1:01:27] from place to place me it was in
[1:01:31] travel they took it all the way through
[1:01:33] the Wilderness and all the way into the
[1:01:35] Temple and so forth but now it's
[1:01:38] received
[1:01:39] up because the church ages over and it's
[1:01:42] received up into Glory sea it's
[1:01:44] stationary now in heaven with all the
[1:01:47] angels and things around around it we
[1:01:50] find them after a while taking off their
[1:01:52] crowns and the guards of the Temple now
[1:01:54] we'll get to that
[1:01:56] later but I want you to see that brother
[1:01:58] random was one that was tying it
[1:02:00] together he said he was talking about
[1:02:02] the lampstands and all he
[1:02:04] said Ezekiel Saw the same thing
[1:02:09] sure okay now here's the catch of what I
[1:02:13] want you to
[1:02:14] get Ezekiel Saw the Journey of
[1:02:19] Israel and described it as wheels
[1:02:22] turning on a like a cart you know like
[1:02:24] Ark and being pulled by animals and
[1:02:27] being but he really saw the travel of
[1:02:29] Israel
[1:02:32] right
[1:02:33] right he saw him on in Journey on earth
[1:02:39] right and he called them living
[1:02:41] creatures that's
[1:02:43] right all
[1:02:46] right but see once the symbols broke you
[1:02:48] see he was looking at the Trav of Israel
[1:02:51] right it's like Ezekiel Saw believe this
[1:02:54] right Ezekiel Saw fire falling down out
[1:02:57] of
[1:02:59] Heaven he saw the end time with atomic
[1:03:01] destruction in he right
[1:03:04] sure like nonon saw chariots jostling in
[1:03:07] the street running like
[1:03:09] lightning he saw cars down here running
[1:03:12] forth with headlights
[1:03:14] on
[1:03:15] right he thank God for the profit and
[1:03:18] bringing the symbols right
[1:03:21] man but now remember what he said
[1:03:26] Ezekiel Saw the Journey of
[1:03:32] Israel all right John saw it after it's
[1:03:35] reached its position in
[1:03:39] heaven but then you can see the wheel in
[1:03:42] the middle of the wheel is
[1:03:44] what it's been the Journey of the Bride
[1:03:46] of Jesus Christ that's right amen down
[1:03:49] through seven Church ages
[1:03:51] right we'll get to those combat Beast
[1:03:54] later
[1:03:54] bring it
[1:03:55] out and bring it out even to show
[1:03:58] Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:04:02] John but the main thing I wanted you to
[1:04:04] get was what he
[1:04:05] said Ezekiel Saw the Journey of Israel
[1:04:08] while on
[1:04:11] Earth John in the fourth chapter SE had
[1:04:14] already taken his place but what about
[1:04:15] your journey and my journey amen that's
[1:04:17] right what about our wheel in the middle
[1:04:18] of the wheel
[1:04:20] amen the wheel in the middle of the
[1:04:22] wheel to Israel was Christ right right
[1:04:24] amen what about our wheel in the middle
[1:04:26] of the wheel right what about our
[1:04:31] journey that we're traveling what about
[1:04:34] what we're doing
[1:04:38] now changing from Mercy Seat to judgment
[1:04:45] seat changing to show
[1:04:51] us the seven lampstands
[1:04:57] jump on over to quote number 10 Brothers
[1:05:00] we'll leave out all these
[1:05:03] others number nine
[1:05:05] covers that it's the day of Mercy is
[1:05:09] over and it's
[1:05:11] covering the when the church is raptured
[1:05:14] to Mercy Seat becomes a judgment seat
[1:05:17] that's
[1:05:19] right when we go
[1:05:23] up Mercy is over for the Gentiles amen
[1:05:27] that's right Mercy Seat will
[1:05:29] automatically become judgment seat
[1:05:31] that's correct amen so let's don't
[1:05:34] spiritualize us getting there so much
[1:05:36] yeah right let's take the journey we're
[1:05:38] in amen that's
[1:05:40] right let's take these lamp stands as we
[1:05:43] read while
[1:05:44] ago Revelation 4 part
[1:05:49] three paragraph
[1:05:52] 125 seven lamps
[1:05:56] let's draw a little bit here the throne
[1:05:58] the holy place the congregation and
[1:06:00] right here with 1 2 3 4 56 seven seven
[1:06:03] stars seven lamps seven Messengers seven
[1:06:06] spirits not all together meaning that
[1:06:08] God is in seven Spirit but seven
[1:06:11] manifestations of the same holy spirit
[1:06:15] amen now Church we're doing our journey
[1:06:18] now we're in the journey Ezekiel Saw of
[1:06:21] Israel which was a
[1:06:24] right that's
[1:06:26] right Israel in Journey was a type of
[1:06:30] our our journey that's right we're not
[1:06:32] in a type we're the
[1:06:34] antitype right we're in reality they
[1:06:38] didn't have the new birth in the Old
[1:06:39] Testament that's right they didn't have
[1:06:41] the Seal of God in their soul by the new
[1:06:43] birth right right CU they could only
[1:06:46] type what you and I doing so if Ezekiel
[1:06:49] Saw Israel in Journey and described it
[1:06:52] with all these combat beasts and all
[1:06:53] these
[1:06:55] lights and Perfections and the thing
[1:06:57] what about God and what he's seeing her
[1:06:59] the little
[1:07:00] bride that she's been traveling down
[1:07:02] through seven Church ages
[1:07:05] y she's been in Journey and God's been
[1:07:08] with
[1:07:10] her pleased to dwell he said amen you
[1:07:13] know what he's just as pleased to dwell
[1:07:14] with Luther as he D pleased to dwell
[1:07:16] with you you might not like that but
[1:07:18] that's that's right gospel truth no I'm
[1:07:22] special I'm right next to the Drone all
[1:07:24] right if you're right next to the throne
[1:07:26] if you're the seventh one let me be
[1:07:29] carnal for a
[1:07:31] minute he said he was in the midst of
[1:07:34] the seven golden Candlestick cuz that
[1:07:35] put him in the first in the the what
[1:07:38] church ages would he be in that would
[1:07:40] put him here more than he is with you so
[1:07:42] you better back up on what you're saying
[1:07:45] you see how people want to run around
[1:07:47] and make all kind of statements oh he's
[1:07:49] here now that wasn't nothing like there
[1:07:52] man stood right here
[1:07:56] and said it years
[1:07:59] ago big man in this
[1:08:02] message and he
[1:08:04] said the prophet said Luther and Wesley
[1:08:07] and Pentecost was
[1:08:09] false I had done challenged him on that
[1:08:12] down at the school house it guiltful and
[1:08:14] asked him for the
[1:08:16] quo I said brother Brandon said he was a
[1:08:18] never Church age he came on right up
[1:08:21] here didn't change his mind of course he
[1:08:22] couldn't preach error anyway so my
[1:08:24] saying something to him wouldn't change
[1:08:29] it he came right don't hear any he
[1:08:31] preached and he said that Luther and
[1:08:33] Wesley and Pentecost was
[1:08:36] false I don't agree with
[1:08:39] that and like I said if you're going to
[1:08:41] be the natural carnal with statements
[1:08:43] then if he was in the mid that mean he
[1:08:44] was more back there in Luther and wesle
[1:08:47] than he is here
[1:08:48] now the people don't realize what you're
[1:08:51] doing but people that are listening
[1:08:54] don't realize what they're listening to
[1:08:56] oh ain't that something look at w was
[1:08:58] false brother so said it
[1:09:01] was well I don't give a who what brother
[1:09:04] so and so says or what I say it's what
[1:09:06] the prophet of God had to say about it
[1:09:09] right we know what the prophet of God
[1:09:11] had to say about it come from God of
[1:09:13] course now they're all trying to S
[1:09:14] brother Rand was so wrong yeah
[1:09:18] you all of his errors and all of these
[1:09:21] things
[1:09:22] yeah go ahead it's got to be there must
[1:09:26] needs be heresies among you the they
[1:09:28] that are approved may be made
[1:09:30] manifest we just keep walking on with
[1:09:32] the truth seven lamps is
[1:09:36] what the seven spirits of God the seven
[1:09:40] manifestations of the Holy Spirit down
[1:09:43] through seven Church
[1:09:45] ages as our journey was taking
[1:09:50] place see John sees it already in heaven
[1:09:53] with right that
[1:09:56] right Ezekiel Saw while we on while they
[1:09:59] was on Earth dark and he sees our
[1:10:01] journey
[1:10:04] right ain't that something I it it don't
[1:10:07] stir your heart to
[1:10:09] think that a prophet would be brought to
[1:10:12] us to tell us these things am when
[1:10:14] somebody else say well I think that
[1:10:15] really means here you know I think that
[1:10:17] that wheel means this and this means
[1:10:19] that and that's go there and that means
[1:10:21] this and them Bo them Beast and all
[1:10:24] these things and and don't even know
[1:10:26] there's two different types of beast in
[1:10:27] the Bible in the Book of
[1:10:29] Revelation we'll get that this
[1:10:31] evening one of them is a zoom z o
[1:10:36] n that's the correct one that's right
[1:10:38] the other one is t h e r i o n I believe
[1:10:41] way you spell itones which means
[1:10:44] untable
[1:10:46] unconverted that's right you can't tame
[1:10:49] them n that's right you ain't going to
[1:10:51] change them no that's right you ain't
[1:10:54] going to change the people this message
[1:10:55] that's correct
[1:10:58] amen I I hate to say this something like
[1:11:01] hard sometime maybe for the Holy Ghost
[1:11:02] to even converted yeah right I don't
[1:11:05] mean that
[1:11:07] wrong I believe the Holy Ghost can
[1:11:09] change
[1:11:10] anybody but if we don't voluntarily get
[1:11:13] in there and do what's right he ain't
[1:11:15] going to make us
[1:11:17] change and we could wind up being the
[1:11:20] Theon like I told you brother here
[1:11:21] preach I saw my S as a white horse
[1:11:27] rider he said then I got
[1:11:30] converted I said brother if you're the
[1:11:32] white horse rider you're the Antichrist
[1:11:34] which means a Theon beast and you can't
[1:11:37] be
[1:11:38] converted that didn't change his
[1:11:43] ideas but you see Church what are
[1:11:48] we do you understand when Ezekiel is
[1:11:50] asking you do you understand the wheel
[1:11:52] the Middle with some of you did some
[1:11:53] didn't H but the ones that said you did
[1:11:56] understand what did you see it this this
[1:11:57] the wheel in the middle of wheel being
[1:11:58] Jesus
[1:11:59] Christ you know that Jesus Christ was
[1:12:02] back there in their Journey leading the
[1:12:04] children of Israel I'll send my angel
[1:12:07] he'll go before thee I'm quot
[1:12:10] scripture right and my name will be in
[1:12:12] him and you better mind him in other
[1:12:15] words brother R said I used to wonder
[1:12:18] who could tell God a better way of doing
[1:12:19] something there in Moses he said I found
[1:12:21] out it was Christ in Moses amen there
[1:12:24] was your wheel in the middle of the
[1:12:26] wheel that led right up to Calvary right
[1:12:29] amen right but then it started in the
[1:12:32] church
[1:12:34] ages and remember what I saying to start
[1:12:36] with we got to be able to see here right
[1:12:39] what's there it's being developed here
[1:12:42] God's strong is being made here in the
[1:12:45] heart of
[1:12:48] mankind well brother I just see myself
[1:12:50] there I don't worry about them deep
[1:12:52] things I I just see myself step side
[1:12:55] what my brother around said he seen me
[1:12:58] yeah he said he seen people in Hell also
[1:13:01] I ain't mean that's true he's in both
[1:13:05] places and seen
[1:13:07] people you see that's where people just
[1:13:09] just they just say well well that's why
[1:13:11] we've been here 40 something
[1:13:14] years the reason we've been here 40
[1:13:16] something years is for the bride of
[1:13:17] Christ to try to get anchored in the
[1:13:20] word and to get worse you won't be blown
[1:13:22] by these little 6i doctrines that's
[1:13:25] right I told you 40 years ago when the
[1:13:27] two souls in those doctrines were out
[1:13:30] first starting I said you think that's
[1:13:33] deceiving I said this ain't deceiving
[1:13:36] right I said because they can't even
[1:13:38] quote correctly
[1:13:40] right you remember the two Soul was the
[1:13:43] soul was just the nature go read the
[1:13:45] book it doesn't say that soul is the
[1:13:46] nature of the spirit don't even use the
[1:13:47] word just they can't even quote but I
[1:13:50] said they'll come a time when they'll be
[1:13:52] using Brother ran them as quotes to
[1:13:55] prove their
[1:13:56] point look at them
[1:14:02] now well brother that that brother he he
[1:14:05] gave 24
[1:14:06] quotes all
[1:14:10] right Amen brother R said it
[1:14:14] sure but what's the truth
[1:14:17] right like a man said to brother dick
[1:14:20] one day because brother dick said he
[1:14:21] agreed with what I said he said do you
[1:14:22] understand what he nobody said explain
[1:14:24] it to me in your words something like
[1:14:26] that he said put it in your
[1:14:30] words you know if you can't put this
[1:14:32] message in your words right y you're
[1:14:35] just quoting what somebody else says
[1:14:37] that's right amen and is that what the
[1:14:40] scripture says no man can call Jesus the
[1:14:42] Christ except it be my personal
[1:14:45] experience with him right the seven
[1:14:48] lampstands what are
[1:14:51] they and the message called Pat Vision
[1:14:53] ion we won't pull these up I'll just
[1:14:55] read a few just quote a few of them
[1:14:57] patmas Vision which is actually page 50
[1:14:59] Church age book It's a Wonderful type of
[1:15:02] the Holy Ghost in the seven Church ages
[1:15:05] the original outpouring of Pentecost
[1:15:07] which outpouring came direct from Jesus
[1:15:09] on The Mercy Seat is enduring his church
[1:15:13] through all the Seven Ages and showing
[1:15:15] forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the
[1:15:18] same yesterday today and
[1:15:20] forever now so we'll to set few words
[1:15:23] real
[1:15:25] quick so if you notice that when I was
[1:15:28] trying to bring Revelations
[1:15:32] 4:1 and I
[1:15:37] said that all of this was showing the
[1:15:39] bride of
[1:15:43] Christ but then when I came to
[1:15:45] Revelations 4 about five there or 4 four
[1:15:49] I
[1:15:50] guess I had a gap there
[1:15:54] because it jumped from Mercy to
[1:16:04] judgment come
[1:16:06] on is I right I get a scripture right
[1:16:09] where it comes the fourth verse that it
[1:16:10] turn to Thunders and Lightnings Etc the
[1:16:13] prophet said this is Judgment or
[1:16:20] 45 you see right we can look up there
[1:16:24] right now and I believe Redemption is
[1:16:25] not over yet that's
[1:16:29] right see people said that
[1:16:33] 1963 I told men I said according to my
[1:16:35] Bible and the prophet Redemption was
[1:16:38] over for the foundation of world if
[1:16:39] that's where you're going with your
[1:16:42] carnality because my Bible said Jesus
[1:16:44] Christ stood the land of slame before
[1:16:45] the foundation of the world but see they
[1:16:47] thought 63 something happened I agree
[1:16:49] something happened in 63 I agree 100%
[1:16:52] yes sir me it was wonderful what
[1:16:55] happened there amen because God brought
[1:16:58] us the word through a man amen and
[1:17:00] brought his message amen but you see
[1:17:04] when you first look at John on
[1:17:08] patmas remember he's seeing this as it's
[1:17:12] happening now are you listening yes he's
[1:17:16] seeing this as is happening on
[1:17:20] Earth cuz you got to compare that's
[1:17:23] right right but when it comes to thunder
[1:17:26] and lightning ain't no bright on
[1:17:34] Earth and you know that he's on the
[1:17:36] mercy
[1:17:37] seat and you know that what you're
[1:17:39] seeing in Revelations 41 through about 4
[1:17:43] is still he's on The Mercy
[1:17:45] Seat Revelations 4:5 I think where it
[1:17:48] says Thunders and
[1:17:52] lighten let's make sure let's just read
[1:17:54] that that's right it'll be 4 five yeah
[1:17:56] and out of the throne proceeded
[1:17:58] Lightnings and it becomes a judgment
[1:18:04] seat you better hope it's not to that
[1:18:06] place
[1:18:12] right because judgment will be
[1:18:16] over for the Gentiles at the Rapture of
[1:18:19] the bride of
[1:18:21] Christ
[1:18:25] so if that's already the Judgment seat
[1:18:27] we're in problems because we're still on
[1:18:33] Earth no we went up 4 one could that
[1:18:37] Revelation could that be that John was
[1:18:40] taken up as a
[1:18:42] type what your Prophet
[1:18:46] said could it be that in the Bride of
[1:18:49] Jesus Christ is the Throne of
[1:18:51] God
[1:18:54] you see when redemption's over the only
[1:18:56] thing that's going to take care of you
[1:18:57] and I is the fact of what's inside of
[1:19:01] us CU Redemption is going to be over
[1:19:04] before we leave this world right yes sir
[1:19:07] amen that's what scared the people to
[1:19:09] death when brother around preached
[1:19:11] anointed ones at the end time souls in
[1:19:13] prison
[1:19:16] especially they kept saying is it over
[1:19:19] he said I really don't know
[1:19:21] I
[1:19:23] well you know there's only one reason
[1:19:25] that I know it wasn't over in '
[1:19:27] 63 Butz I wasn't born again
[1:19:30] then I didn't get born again in
[1:19:37] 1969 how many of you was born again
[1:19:39] after 63 right
[1:19:42] amen we know that's a good reason to
[1:19:44] believe that we know 63 amen you know
[1:19:48] that's the way I believe I'm just that's
[1:19:49] honest that's you said well well God
[1:19:51] ain't going to change nothing for you no
[1:19:53] he ain't going to change nothing for
[1:20:00] me but why would people believe
[1:20:02] Redemption is over when your Prophet
[1:20:04] would still give all their
[1:20:07] calls and why would he say those people
[1:20:09] that receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:12] Ghost after
[1:20:14] 63
[1:20:16] right you see it's all in the doctrine
[1:20:21] yes right
[1:20:25] why would you think that your children
[1:20:28] couldn't be saved because they didn't
[1:20:30] get saved for 63 but you
[1:20:34] did what kind of a spirit is
[1:20:41] that like I always told you there was a
[1:20:43] Doctrine over in South Carolina that
[1:20:45] this man started a Doctrine and she
[1:20:46] wasn't supposed to live with your wife
[1:20:49] anymore all that was over with
[1:20:53] he's 80 something years
[1:20:58] old not making a joke
[1:21:04] true people that said Redemption is over
[1:21:06] 63 you better believe they believe they
[1:21:08] got Sav before 63
[1:21:11] right yep but why wouldn't you want it
[1:21:14] for anybody else
[1:21:17] amen I didn't open Redemption and I
[1:21:20] cannot close it right amen but God one
[1:21:23] day will close it right correct see then
[1:21:26] Revelations
[1:21:28] 4 it'll become a judgment seat because
[1:21:30] it's no longer
[1:21:33] Mercy when the bride reaches that place
[1:21:36] Redemption will be
[1:21:38] over and she manifest her part upon
[1:21:41] Earth to be what she's supposed to be
[1:21:42] right Redemption will be over
[1:21:45] amen nobody will be saved after the
[1:21:48] except Israel
[1:21:50] 144,000 Jews later on in the church
[1:21:52] tribulation
[1:21:54] right ain't no foolish virgins to be
[1:21:57] saved in the tribulation that we were
[1:21:59] taught by organized religion right they
[1:22:01] teaches a three and 1/2 years minor
[1:22:03] three and 1/2 years major and they think
[1:22:05] that's what brother random taught about
[1:22:06] it but he never did he only it's only
[1:22:08] three and half years tribulation right
[1:22:10] amen that's organized religion they
[1:22:13] think you get these movies that's all
[1:22:14] Left Behind Etc and and all of these you
[1:22:17] watch in the movie their point the
[1:22:19] Rapture goes up and then over here these
[1:22:21] people's getting saved
[1:22:23] they may be running them down and
[1:22:24] killing them but they're getting
[1:22:25] salvation some way that's their whole
[1:22:28] point you don't make it one way maybe
[1:22:31] we'll make it another way you ever heard
[1:22:32] people say
[1:22:35] that I'm sorry I don't have no second
[1:22:37] point
[1:22:39] right I'm up number one or I ain't going
[1:22:41] to
[1:22:43] be you know what I mean right I'm either
[1:22:46] going to be the bride or I'm going to be
[1:22:47] lost right
[1:22:50] amen I've always told you and I know it
[1:22:52] wouldn't like to hear cuz some made
[1:22:54] remarks about it I always told you I
[1:22:57] quoted brother
[1:22:59] brandom brother Bram said if I'm want to
[1:23:01] be a Antichrist I want to be a good
[1:23:04] one you know that quote's
[1:23:06] real and you know that's what I said I
[1:23:09] said if I want to be a deceiver I want
[1:23:11] to be a good one so you going to better
[1:23:12] be in you better and the one fell said I
[1:23:15] don't
[1:23:16] want one person here said I don't want
[1:23:19] that being told to my
[1:23:21] people
[1:23:25] I just told you what brother R said he
[1:23:26] said if I want to be an antichrist I me
[1:23:28] if I'm going to be an antichrist I'm
[1:23:29] going be a good
[1:23:34] one if I'm going to try my best to help
[1:23:36] this bride it don't matter to me whether
[1:23:38] I go to hell or not right that's correct
[1:23:40] all I want to do is help
[1:23:42] somebody to see Jesus
[1:23:45] Christ that's my goal my
[1:23:49] desire amen what makes you preach
[1:23:51] brother Dale in the line of all the
[1:23:52] things i' have quit for 30 years
[1:23:59] ago but I want to see people saved amen
[1:24:02] that's right I want to see you there yep
[1:24:06] whether I make it or
[1:24:07] not I want to see my children I want
[1:24:09] them to have an opportunity to hear the
[1:24:12] truth I want my grandchildren to have an
[1:24:13] opportunity to hear the truth I want my
[1:24:16] great grand kids man and they got a
[1:24:18] whole lot of adopted when sitting out
[1:24:21] there that's right
[1:24:22] that I want you to see the truth that's
[1:24:24] right
[1:24:25] amen but to
[1:24:28] think that God would show Ezekiel the
[1:24:31] travel of Israel show it in symbols and
[1:24:34] things that people would wonder what
[1:24:35] that is see our journey in travel now
[1:24:39] through seven Church ages through these
[1:24:41] combat
[1:24:44] beasts that's our traveling Journey
[1:24:47] right amen I'm not worried about what's
[1:24:49] in
[1:24:51] heaven
[1:24:53] right right I want to see what's down
[1:24:55] here amen then when I go up there then
[1:24:58] hey that'd be
[1:25:01] wonderful but what about it
[1:25:05] church this is either Christ or nothing
[1:25:08] that's right right cuz you're in a day
[1:25:11] whether we're either Christ or we're
[1:25:14] Antichrist there is no white black bird
[1:25:17] there is no white black dog there is no
[1:25:20] good sinner Saint right
[1:25:25] right that's right we're either Christ
[1:25:27] or we're
[1:25:32] Antichrist you know we make the choice
[1:25:35] yes that's right come on brother we make
[1:25:38] the choice right of what it's to be
[1:25:43] yes it can be Christ in you the hope of
[1:25:48] glory or we can be the
[1:25:51] Antichrist
[1:25:55] lampstands all of these
[1:25:58] things represents the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:00] Christ but see we want to go up to hell
[1:26:02] and to see it I want to see it here amen
[1:26:07] that's right I want to see the
[1:26:09] manifestation that I told you the other
[1:26:10] day where they said when we first came
[1:26:12] into message you know the doctrine was
[1:26:14] around we don't need manifested sons
[1:26:16] that going to be in the Millennium I'm
[1:26:17] not kidding you that this was
[1:26:20] Doctrine we don't need manifested Sons
[1:26:23] we need a we got the doctors to go to we
[1:26:25] got all these things we're going to need
[1:26:27] we're going to have manifested sons in
[1:26:28] the
[1:26:29] Millennium and I finally found where the
[1:26:31] prophet of God said we don't need
[1:26:33] manifested sons in the Millennium we
[1:26:36] need them now you know that didn't
[1:26:38] change
[1:26:39] anybody no I never heard one person I'm
[1:26:43] truthful I never heard one person say I
[1:26:47] was wrong and that quote straightened me
[1:26:49] out not one
[1:26:55] because you see we're either theor or
[1:26:58] we're in
[1:27:00] yeah go we're all Beast
[1:27:04] Y which we're either Christians or we're
[1:27:07] lost right the Book of Revelation shows
[1:27:11] the
[1:27:12] Beast four combat Beast there's four
[1:27:16] Beast to take us down right yep what are
[1:27:20] we going to do
[1:27:22] we have the
[1:27:24] choice well I just don't understand I
[1:27:26] don't understand why why because it's
[1:27:30] simple amen
[1:27:32] Ezekiel all Israel in Journey right all
[1:27:36] them types and all them things is you
[1:27:38] and I in Journey right
[1:27:42] amen only of these things we're talking

[1:27:48] Earth in the heart of man
[1:27:50] amen by the New
[1:27:53] Birth will one day go there and be that
[1:27:56] throne but is it that we're going to go
[1:28:04] there that's where we hooked up
[1:28:07] from I
[1:28:10] thought that we meet Jesus in the
[1:28:17] a I didn't know we met him on
