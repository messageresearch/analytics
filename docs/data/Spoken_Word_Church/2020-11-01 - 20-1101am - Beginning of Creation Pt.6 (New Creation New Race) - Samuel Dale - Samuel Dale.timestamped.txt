[19:48] biggest guy you know
[19:50] and i couldn't walk the furthest i could
[19:53] walk was
[19:53] near brother louise there at all and
[19:56] they wouldn't let me walk that
[19:58] but uh the thing of it was they had me
[20:01] in this room and it was
[20:03] fixed up to filter out i reckon all of
[20:06] the things and this great big pipe ran
[20:08] through the floor and ran up and this
[20:10] machine was running and
[20:12] i don't know what in the world they was
[20:13] doing but uh you know
[20:15] then you you you get a phone call and
[20:18] and you think a phone call don't mean
[20:19] nothing
[20:21] but when you're stuck in a place that
[20:23] you don't know where in the world you at
[20:26] and what's going on a little phone call
[20:29] is a great thing so you know thank god
[20:31] for all of that
[20:32] and all that they had trouble trying to
[20:34] find me in the hospital
[20:36] but that's all right they moved me about
[20:38] and
[20:39] done it they took care of me i'll just
[20:42] put it that way
[20:43] but i appreciate your prayers is the
[20:44] main thing you're praying
[20:47] every day and holding me up okay if you
[20:49] like turn in your scriptures

[21:13] we'll leave it on that basis okay
[21:15] that uh but i hope you you keep in mind
[21:18] all of these things
[21:19] of the announcements that terrence has
[21:21] made and we'll make them over and over
[21:22] and over
[21:23] because we're trying to get a place you
[21:25] know and to do where we can all be
[21:27] together
[21:28] and in this building we can all be
[21:30] together and we can have ten by ten
[21:32] square foots
[21:33] left over you know we can we can
[21:36] fellowship together okay
[21:38] but we'll have a good time in the lord
[21:41] and unto the angel of the church of the
[21:43] lady of sian's right
[21:45] these things saith the amen the faithful
[21:47] and true witness
[21:49] the beginning of the creation of god
[21:52] all right let's go to john
[21:56] and in the beginning in the beginning
[21:58] was the word and the word was with god
[22:00] and the word was god
[22:01] the same was in the beginning with god
[22:04] all things were made by him and without
[22:06] him was not
[22:07] anything made that was made to verse 14
[22:11] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[22:14] among us
[22:15] and we beheld his glory the glory as the
[22:18] only begotten of the father
[22:20] full of grace and truth
[22:23] father we thank you for this day and
[22:25] opportunity to be able to come together
[22:27] to fellowship together in you and we
[22:30] pray that you would just bless us now
[22:31] and guide us
[22:32] give us lord of your love and
[22:34] understanding may we walk in the light
[22:37] of the lord in jesus name
[22:38] amen you may be seated
[22:45] i had a long time to
[22:49] you know to meditate
[22:52] and think on a lot of things and
[22:56] church i believe that you and i
[22:59] are right on the threshold i told you
[23:02] when all this started with the virus
[23:04] that it was not the end
[23:06] it was the beginning of the end it was
[23:08] just starting the phases coming down
[23:11] but we are coming now all of this
[23:13] election time to all of these things
[23:15] that's none of my business who gets the
[23:16] president
[23:17] it ain't going to change one thing i
[23:20] don't care if they make
[23:21] every one of them president give them 50
[23:24] more of them or whatever
[23:25] it ain't going to change nothing because
[23:27] we're here at the
[23:28] end of all things and being at the end
[23:31] of it then let's
[23:32] rejoice in that because we know
[23:36] see we know that we're at the end
[23:40] we know that we're that we can't
[23:42] continue this situation
[23:45] of existence for a long period of time
[23:48] it can't be done so we know that things
[23:51] will have to take place and whatever
[23:54] but just remember one thing god is in
[23:57] command
[23:59] he's taking care of it don't worry about
[24:01] it you say well well i don't understand
[24:04] all of this brother dale why like wade
[24:06] was bringing out about the
[24:07] uh you know people
[24:10] that are sick are the people that are
[24:13] christians
[24:14] a lot of times and the others are doing
[24:16] better
[24:17] well you know don't worry about it i
[24:20] thought
[24:21] that we believed that there was nothing
[24:25] put on us
[24:26] that god didn't allow it to happen
[24:29] i mean that's my understanding now
[24:32] that's not talking about a daily little
[24:34] coal or sniffles that's part of it too
[24:37] yeah
[24:37] but the main thing are large things
[24:39] coming on people
[24:40] that are believers you say well why
[24:44] well he's putting them there
[24:48] to test me and you
[24:50] [Music]
[24:51] he's putting it there to test us
[24:55] he said brother and said she'd this
[24:57] bride would prove to satan
[24:59] that she wouldn't fall like eve so then
[25:02] whatever it is
[25:04] bring it on let's get on with it and get
[25:06] everything under
[25:07] way and just rest in christ and say
[25:10] thank you lord
[25:12] and things starts going wrong you just
[25:14] pray and come together
[25:15] and pray and fellowship together around
[25:18] the word and
[25:19] and let it all wind up finish out
[25:21] because it will
[25:23] and and we're on the thresholds of those
[25:25] things how long
[25:26] who's worried i'm not concerned about
[25:29] how long or what's going on
[25:31] i'm concerned with the fact of what you
[25:34] and i
[25:34] are doing with what god is allowing
[25:38] to happen now that's my point
[25:41] what are we doing with what god allows
[25:45] do you agree that he has to allow these
[25:48] things
[25:51] he couldn't get onto job until god
[25:54] turned him
[25:55] loose satan can't do it he can't do
[25:58] those things
[25:59] all right but see to think that
[26:02] if my name is called in heaven i think
[26:05] that's a great thing don't you
[26:08] but what if your name is called in
[26:09] heaven and it comes forth that you're an
[26:11] overcomer
[26:13] what a great thing okay let's just keep
[26:15] those things in mind
[26:17] and just think about it that we're here
[26:20] to
[26:20] end and as it finishes everything up
[26:24] then we are the people
[26:28] that the ends of the world has come upon
[26:30] them that's what the bible says
[26:33] all right so let's rejoice in where
[26:35] we're at and what's taking place
[26:38] we don't rejoice in bad sicknesses and
[26:40] not all like that no
[26:42] but we rejoice when we're healed and
[26:45] brought out of it
[26:47] it's a wonderful thing amen okay
[26:50] all right now when i
[26:54] back when we started with all of this
[26:57] and i kind of backed off
[26:59] and let the brothers start ministering
[27:01] and i certainly appreciate them
[27:04] they have done a marvelous job taking
[27:07] over
[27:08] and and bringing the word to us and i
[27:10] appreciate it
[27:12] because they're they're doing great uh
[27:14] i'm i'm
[27:15] i'm thrilled at watching them because i
[27:17] like to watch
[27:18] uh young people come up and move on
[27:22] i like to see you gain ground and and do
[27:25] things
[27:26] but i like to see you gain ground on
[27:28] your own
[27:30] [Music]
[27:32] that's the one thing is gang ground on
[27:34] your own helping people is great
[27:38] but to worship god and just
[27:41] move on in our own okay uh we were
[27:44] in the beginning
[27:48] of the creation that was our title
[27:52] and thoughts back there and we'll
[27:54] continue on to think about these things
[27:57] because
[27:57] remember the point that i was trying to
[28:01] bring out
[28:02] then and i've listened two or three
[28:04] times to the same message to make sure
[28:06] and try to follow it
[28:07] is the the beginning of the creation
[28:13] that god so placed it before us till
[28:16] it's a marvelous thing
[28:18] we we go to christ the mystery and we
[28:20] talk about how that
[28:21] all god was he was in christ all christ
[28:23] in the church take her back to the
[28:24] garden of eden et cetera
[28:26] and all like that we see those things
[28:28] but my point was to try to get you to
[28:31] think about the creation
[28:34] all right and in that thinking about it
[28:37] we talked about it in three stages
[28:41] we talked about it as stage one that god
[28:44] comes into being
[28:48] in a stage that was would be
[28:52] counted as from uh how would you say it
[28:57] brother random will say he said there
[28:58] was nothing back there
[29:01] all right and he'd emphasize there's
[29:03] nothing back there
[29:04] then in a minute he'd say with the great
[29:08] eternal god
[29:10] well see there was never a time never
[29:13] has been a time
[29:15] there's there should be no thoughts in
[29:17] anybody's human mind to think that there
[29:18] was a time that god didn't exist
[29:22] because who would bring what into being
[29:25] if he was not there and to be able to
[29:27] bring us we wouldn't have got a year
[29:29] but we ought to think about that that he
[29:32] was
[29:33] he so marvelously
[29:36] i sat down and i really cry about it
[29:39] because to think that god would reveal
[29:41] to a
[29:42] group of people his very plan
[29:45] and purpose
[29:50] you're you're a part of that plan and
[29:52] purpose
[29:54] you're a part of it that's that's what
[29:56] it is it's not something that
[29:58] he thanks up along the way he knew it
[30:00] from the beginning
[30:02] all right and see in that then he's the
[30:05] beginning of the creation
[30:08] back there right remember put it in
[30:10] three stages put it back before the
[30:11] foundation of the world or whatever
[30:13] then we brought it in to jesus christ
[30:16] coming on earth
[30:17] into human flesh into a body to live
[30:21] and then to bring it to the bride of
[30:23] christ
[30:25] to bring it into the finishing up of the
[30:27] creation
[30:29] as it would be now remember we talked
[30:31] about new creation just as a minute to
[30:33] make sure our thoughts is running right
[30:36] when you use
[30:36] new in the bible terminologies it's not
[30:39] necessarily meaning
[30:41] something new especially it does not
[30:44] reference to
[30:45] something different it does not
[30:48] reference to something
[30:49] that was here in here you know it's
[30:53] to me it's it's just a point of
[30:56] uh seeing how that god could come into
[31:00] being
[31:01] all right now i said we hold it to the
[31:03] three stages because see
[31:05] he's still coming into being ever born
[31:08] again believer
[31:12] ever born again believer coming into the
[31:15] body of christ you realize
[31:16] that makes you a part of god
[31:21] you say no no no no well what does it
[31:24] make you
[31:26] it makes you a part of god that inner
[31:28] being that soul
[31:29] that part of you that god is working on
[31:33] and as he does he brings it into being
[31:35] and showing us
[31:37] that he had a beginning not he had that
[31:40] he didn't exist there's nothing nothing
[31:42] and all it wants something no
[31:46] it's just the fact of one thing i i
[31:48] wrote this down where i
[31:50] emphasize it
[31:54] beginning or new in other words
[31:57] is a starting point sure
[32:00] because that's the emphasis new you know
[32:02] starting or whatever
[32:05] but it's really starting the fact
[32:08] of how that god can come into being
[32:14] we can see how a tree plant a seed
[32:16] poetry that comes into being
[32:18] we can see how the all of the things of
[32:20] the world of life can come into being
[32:23] but do we ever think about that god
[32:25] coming into being not coming into being
[32:28] that he was non-existent not the fact
[32:31] that he was not there in his fullness
[32:35] because he was god in the beginning
[32:36] he'll always be god
[32:38] so you can't make it anything else all
[32:40] right but see
[32:42] to think about it then it just means
[32:44] there's something going to come into
[32:46] view
[32:48] and god is going to unveil himself
[32:53] and reveal himself and see then that's
[32:56] why i say
[32:57] that when we come to the third stage of
[32:59] it we get to that stage of seeing
[33:01] that christ is the mystery of god
[33:03] revealed he's in his bride
[33:07] and that comes forth into that perfect
[33:10] time
[33:10] but thinking about it how that we see
[33:13] him come into
[33:14] being back there or unveil himself and
[33:17] as the bible says
[33:18] as we was reading there the only
[33:20] begotten
[33:22] he has made him known all right
[33:26] see then we think about well was there a
[33:29] time that god didn't exist see those
[33:31] things are
[33:32] are uh uh really of none at
[33:35] use to me i don't want to call it a lot
[33:38] of crazy words but
[33:40] that's of non-existent things because uh
[33:43] who would ever think about a time that
[33:45] they wasn't a god
[33:46] then who started what see
[33:50] no you can't do that but to think about
[33:52] that that god
[33:54] would think so much of his people
[33:59] that he would
[34:02] come down condescend
[34:07] whatever the words you want to use move
[34:09] down
[34:10] into a realm that human mortals
[34:14] can have a little idea about god
[34:20] you know just a little idea about him
[34:23] because that's all we're getting
[34:24] when we get out of this world there'll
[34:26] be wonderful marvelous
[34:28] this is the way i see it because i
[34:29] believe we're just making we're just
[34:31] getting ready here
[34:32] to be able when we get there to be able
[34:34] to understand what's going on
[34:37] all right and he'll express all of those
[34:39] things and you and i will be there
[34:40] and we'll have a wonderful time
[34:42] fellowshipping together around the word
[34:44] that we heard
[34:46] and say do you remember i i remember
[34:49] sitting there that day
[34:50] and all at once it just come over me and
[34:53] god just
[34:54] began to reveal himself and open his
[34:57] word
[34:57] and begin to to bring it out to where i
[34:59] could see
[35:01] you say well that was wonderful because
[35:04] see we'll have a wonderful time to do
[35:06] all right but talking about how that god
[35:09] comes into being
[35:10] stage one of the three stages of the
[35:14] beginning of the creation and that's why
[35:17] we're using it that way because
[35:18] see in revelations 3 14 is to this age
[35:23] that's this age right and this age is
[35:26] the age to get the revelation
[35:29] of all to bring it all into being
[35:34] that we can see it and we can see how
[35:35] that god is coming forth
[35:38] and how he begin to condescend
[35:42] and as he was condescending he would
[35:45] have to open the
[35:46] eyes of mankind
[35:49] to be able to see so it begins sometimes
[35:53] in baby form i know i would say in all
[35:55] times in baby form
[35:56] because it begins in the basis of little
[35:58] bitty things that we can follow
[36:01] well you know that's why that uh
[36:04] you know maybe maybe i look at it in a
[36:07] funny way
[36:08] but you know to explain something in
[36:11] baby
[36:12] form you know
[36:15] i mean it really it means you explain it
[36:17] where the baby can understand
[36:19] that's first off do you realize
[36:23] what if what if you don't ever think
[36:25] like that
[36:26] what if god had not sent
[36:29] a prophet of the caliber
[36:32] ever how you say that caliber every
[36:34] style of manner
[36:36] that he is what if he sent a theologian
[36:44] what if he'd have revealed him and i
[36:45] ain't saying it he doesn't reveal
[36:46] himself to the theologians no no no
[36:48] we're not talking about that
[36:50] i'm talking about god's promise in the
[36:52] word
[36:53] to send us a prophet to restore the word
[36:56] all right
[36:56] now we're not talking about degrading
[36:58] nobody for how much education or
[37:00] whatever
[37:00] we're talking about the simple thoughts
[37:03] of understanding
[37:04] that you realize when a prophet
[37:08] explains something he makes it so simple
[37:13] how many of you remember the first time
[37:15] that you heard him say
[37:18] well you know there's not three gods
[37:21] there's just one god well we baptist
[37:23] said that
[37:25] you know we understood those things but
[37:27] he says
[37:29] he said he he's not in three persons
[37:33] but said it's like a father he said i'm
[37:37] a father and i have
[37:38] children a son and said
[37:42] you know i'm a human being
[37:46] well here sets a a group of people in a
[37:49] church
[37:50] i'm not throwing no slangs i'm talking
[37:52] all right
[37:53] coming from back in the old pentecostals
[37:56] move
[37:56] and things coming through that some of
[37:58] you can well remember
[38:00] that you know it was a hard times and
[38:04] tight times and
[38:05] different things of going and all but
[38:09] yet god was there and you know simple
[38:12] people could understand
[38:14] i was listening we were like not too of
[38:17] random talking
[38:18] you know i know this happened with a
[38:20] brother
[38:22] that he he pronounced some words and
[38:24] said some things one time about
[38:26] something
[38:26] and the the law got after him
[38:30] and maybe some of you heard that you
[38:31] know and as they did
[38:33] because he was they was using words you
[38:36] know that were
[38:37] were not
[38:40] shouldn't be used i guess but you know
[38:43] what
[38:44] that prophet would just talk
[38:48] and he could talk in a language
[38:53] that everybody can understand
[38:57] now this is my idea of education
[39:01] here's my idea of an education an
[39:04] education is the basis of being able to
[39:09] know and communicate
[39:12] i mean what good does it do for god to
[39:14] give brother louise
[39:17] a great mastermind of
[39:20] all of the things that he could explain
[39:23] the wheel than where it came from
[39:25] or something what good is that
[39:29] if i don't understand what he's talking
[39:32] about
[39:34] i don't know what a wheel is i don't
[39:35] know what to tell you
[39:37] but he can take it and break it down and
[39:40] say
[39:41] this and this and and put it to a basis
[39:46] if he can then he's the educated person
[39:48] the educated person is the person that
[39:50] can get across what he's talking about
[39:51] okay do you understand it that way an
[39:54] educated person to me is a person
[39:56] who can get across what he's talking
[39:58] about
[39:59] if i can't get it across what good is it
[40:01] for it to be education you know
[40:03] i've tried to explain things to people
[40:05] and i did we were thinking about a
[40:06] brother
[40:07] the other day and i loved him so much
[40:10] and uh but we were talking about the
[40:13] seals and
[40:14] and uh i said something about one of the
[40:18] seals and how it fits in this way that
[40:19] away and
[40:21] he said brother he said
[40:26] i don't understand
[40:29] he said i'm not saying you're wrong he
[40:31] said you're right i guess
[40:33] he said but i just don't have the
[40:35] ability to understand what you're
[40:37] talking about
[40:39] well you know what i never did go off
[40:43] and throw a grapefruit
[40:44] i went to a brother the other day told
[40:46] him something he told me he couldn't
[40:47] understand what i'm talking about
[40:48] and all that broke my heart that i
[40:51] didn't make it simple enough
[40:54] that i didn't break it down enough
[40:57] maybe for him to understand but i
[40:59] thought more of him
[41:01] because he was willing to admit
[41:05] where 99.99 of the ministers
[41:08] i'll set that away and not throw no
[41:10] stone
[41:11] wouldn't even listen long enough for you
[41:13] to try to explain
[41:15] the things you know try to express it
[41:20] and i began to try to find a more
[41:21] simpler way of expressing what i was
[41:24] talking about
[41:25] and i think it worked and you know has
[41:27] finally come to the
[41:28] basis that we can see that we're talking
[41:32] about the one true and living god the
[41:34] entire bible the entire message
[41:36] everything is talking about god
[41:38] revealing himself to his people
[41:40] and to sit down and be able to read a
[41:42] book or or listen to a prophet or read
[41:44] the bible
[41:45] and be able to think about it and think
[41:48] about
[41:49] that hey i can understand that
[41:56] you know i can comprehend
[41:59] what's being said
[42:02] and see then that way if i can
[42:04] comprehend it
[42:06] then i'm part of it you ever thought
[42:09] about it like that of your own self
[42:11] that you're a part of it because only by
[42:13] being a part of it we'd be able to
[42:15] comprehend but it'll never be
[42:18] the great theological terminologies of
[42:22] life to understand the word because
[42:24] it'll never work
[42:25] right they have to be used or there
[42:28] brother branham used them i mean brother
[42:30] brown would talk about a theophany a
[42:32] logos
[42:33] and he he thought it theopopey or some
[42:36] you know
[42:37] he couldn't even pronounce the words of
[42:40] what he were doing
[42:41] but you remember what he said he said
[42:43] when i have trouble trying to understand
[42:45] these things what did he say
[42:47] he said i go look it up
[42:52] well see a great theologian a great you
[42:54] know intellectual per
[42:55] i know what that means cat means cat and
[42:58] we just leave it to that what are you
[42:59] trying to do
[43:01] you know you know but a a simple-minded
[43:04] person
[43:06] and if you'll think about the bible and
[43:08] i'd invite you to go all the way through
[43:10] why is it in the bible you have
[43:13] let's see you have moses and paul
[43:19] right too highly educational
[43:23] type of form right the rest of the bible
[43:27] is not that away
[43:30] no one could compare with paul on his
[43:33] understanding
[43:34] we take the communion without even
[43:36] thinking about it
[43:38] but to think that the the communion was
[43:41] passed down to the disciples and they
[43:43] were there when it was the first time
[43:44] and
[43:45] and all of these things but yet when it
[43:46] was all finished
[43:49] paul was chosen
[43:52] to explain the communion
[43:57] why because he had all of that
[44:00] background
[44:02] he knew all the things that like wade
[44:03] brought out how that there's certain
[44:04] plates left there's certain things left
[44:07] paul knew every bit of that and he could
[44:10] put it into simple terms
[44:13] people think paul is a deep part no he's
[44:16] very simple
[44:18] he makes it so simple until really the
[44:20] the
[44:21] the educated fall over in the simplicity
[44:25] now the point i'm i'm trying to get it
[44:27] is can we see the condescending of god
[44:31] that as he comes into view as he's
[44:34] coming down
[44:35] through that frame of whatever you call
[44:38] it
[44:39] the existence of whatever that were that
[44:42] he was
[44:43] there as self-existing
[44:49] and we can think about him as being
[44:52] self-existing
[44:54] well see that may be hard to think about
[44:56] but you know this is what makes it
[44:57] easier for me to
[44:58] understand he was self-existing
[45:03] because he knew the people that he was
[45:04] going to exist with
[45:06] right would be very simple-minded
[45:11] and would require him to bring it in
[45:13] simplicity
[45:16] so he does this and he says that'll
[45:20] that'll make that plain to them
[45:22] they can understand the godhead because
[45:25] i'll put this here
[45:27] and all down through time all the
[45:30] prophets will be trying to explain
[45:32] this thing that the theologians can't
[45:35] see and they think it's a trinity or
[45:37] something
[45:37] and that but they can't see it in there
[45:39] and he said here's
[45:41] a man makes it so simple until everybody
[45:44] can follow him
[45:46] and said the major of it all to bring
[45:48] the last in the end time because i think
[45:49] that
[45:50] that's what i think about brother
[45:51] branham i think that he was the most
[45:53] educated man that has ever been
[45:58] no that sounds funny don't i yeah no
[46:03] but i think he was the most
[46:06] he wasn't illiterate
[46:09] see he wasn't in ever in any form of
[46:13] those
[46:13] but he was to the form that he would put
[46:16] everything
[46:17] so simple
[46:20] the greatest teacher that i've ever
[46:22] heard
[46:26] sit down and teach children he said okay
[46:28] now today said we're going to talk to
[46:30] the children
[46:31] you know teach children
[46:34] his word and they can understand him
[46:39] that to me is a great masterpiece of an
[46:41] understanding
[46:42] is to think that then in this last days
[46:44] we would receive the word of god
[46:47] to where it would be so plain unto us
[46:49] until the children would understand
[46:52] what does that say about the fool shall
[46:54] not air therein you know because i can't
[46:57] but do you see it i mean you're thinking
[46:59] about those things
[47:00] and you think how that he begin to
[47:03] unveil himself
[47:09] and if we'd have been back there
[47:13] we could have got a better understanding
[47:14] but he knew we weren't going to be there
[47:16] he knew we were going to be right where
[47:18] we're at this is the age of
[47:20] understanding this is the age of
[47:22] the the bringing forth of god in his
[47:25] word
[47:27] all right and it's so marvelous to see
[47:29] that looking back there and you see him
[47:31] coming forth
[47:33] he you can't see him and then we get
[47:36] into the scriptures and see
[47:38] the the scripture used to throw me uh
[47:42] god is a spirit and they that works very
[47:45] much worshipping in spirit and
[47:46] truth well i mean i that was wonderful i
[47:49] was
[47:50] that was okay i could follow and
[47:52] comprehend
[47:54] the point of that but when coming to
[47:56] find out
[47:58] that you can't see a spirit
[48:03] right you can't see a spirit
[48:07] so he's coming from something that
[48:09] cannot be seen
[48:11] in that form now follow me
[48:15] that way he could never be understood
[48:18] because it's a spirit
[48:23] and he he still remains that till this
[48:26] day he's still the spirit
[48:27] everything is still the same but yet
[48:30] he's
[48:31] he could express himself till he could
[48:34] move over
[48:35] into another form and then another form
[48:38] in another form
[48:39] and as it is he gradually unveils
[48:42] himself
[48:46] and as he unveiled himself the first
[48:48] thing he does
[48:49] is revealed himself
[48:52] right and see we look at those wordings
[48:55] but that's what i've been trying to get
[48:56] you to see
[48:58] and and i've got this very almost i know
[49:00] they're the same notes but
[49:02] uh diff little order are different but
[49:04] uh
[49:06] of back when i was trying to bring forth
[49:09] this in a way so go ahead let's let's go
[49:12] get a few and then
[49:13] we'll uh we'll take it up later
[49:16] because i want you to see this i want
[49:18] you to see not only
[49:19] see everything in the bible is basically
[49:22] in threes
[49:24] right it's laid out that way
[49:27] and if we follow it in that way then
[49:29] stage one
[49:31] is your your your foundational
[49:35] right and then see you move them into
[49:37] stage two
[49:38] and it's more realistic because you come
[49:41] into jesus being in human flesh
[49:44] all right well see what about when it's
[49:46] coming to the point of him being
[49:48] revealed in you
[49:49] right now right now right now not
[49:53] not you know and brought with that go
[49:56] ahead
[49:56] number number one there brother
[50:02] because i want you to think about these
[50:04] things
[50:06] because that used to bother me when it
[50:07] says god is a spirit well i'd say okay
[50:10] how we're going to ever understand the
[50:11] spirit
[50:13] you know because you can't see it
[50:17] feel it hear it smell it you can't do
[50:20] none of that with a spirit
[50:22] and you realize god is still that
[50:25] but yet he so masterfully has unveiled
[50:28] himself
[50:29] until he can sit right beside of you and
[50:31] you can recognize his presence
[50:34] you know he can walk with you he can can
[50:36] talk to you and you'll recognize it look
[50:38] what he says all for questions and
[50:39] answers
[50:40] no man has seen the father at any time
[50:45] now what you look how marvelous a man is
[50:47] explaining
[50:48] how simple no man can see god
[50:52] in the bodily form now he never said
[50:55] nobody can see god or understand god or
[50:57] comprehend this or
[50:58] but what is the form that you can't
[51:00] understand him
[51:03] what is the form that you can't
[51:05] understand him see no man can see god in
[51:08] the bodily form
[51:09] why simple answer
[51:13] because god is not in body form
[51:17] simple answer somebody says well well
[51:20] you know
[51:21] how can we do that it can't be done all
[51:24] right
[51:25] not in a bodily form god is a spirit all
[51:28] right and no man has seen
[51:30] the father now here we go but the only
[51:33] begotten of the father hath declared him
[51:37] see all right look what he's saying but
[51:40] notice now there's nothing there
[51:42] there's just space there's no light
[51:45] there's no dark there's no nothing it's
[51:48] it's just seems nothing now watch him
[51:51] but in there is a straight supernatural
[51:55] being
[51:59] now remember in the prophet explaining a
[52:00] supernatural being
[52:02] or any form of talking about it being to
[52:04] him it's a real it's real
[52:10] uh any and get that from me because
[52:12] that's what i i believe
[52:14] see if it can come from forth from
[52:19] non-existence of understanding to an
[52:21] existence of understanding
[52:23] it becomes a being
[52:26] it becomes something that can comprehend
[52:29] and talk with us in fellowship
[52:31] what i like is where a prophet would
[52:33] explain like he said uh
[52:35] that he made man he said then when he
[52:38] said when he made man made animal made
[52:40] this way he said when he made the and
[52:42] man he said he saw that adam was lonely
[52:49] right you remember that he said adam was
[52:52] lonely
[52:54] he said you know why because he was
[52:57] lonely
[52:59] see he had nothing to exist with him
[53:02] he was lonely that's wonderful to me a
[53:05] man
[53:06] a great supernatural being jehovah god
[53:09] who covered all space
[53:10] of all places at all times he was from
[53:13] everlasting from everlasting he's the
[53:15] beginning of
[53:17] creation all right now i like that
[53:19] because he breaks it down instead of the
[53:20] beginning of the creation of god
[53:22] he's the beginning of the creation god
[53:24] is going to be made
[53:26] manifest he said that's god can't see
[53:28] nothing can't hear nothing
[53:30] not a move of an atom in the air
[53:33] not nothing not no air
[53:37] no nothing but yet god was there
[53:42] that was god now watch them for a few
[53:45] minutes and all
[53:46] no man has seen that now that's the
[53:49] father
[53:50] that's god the father see nobody has
[53:52] seen that
[53:54] you can't see it it's a spirit he's
[53:57] still a spirit
[53:58] my father is a spirit i don't have any
[54:00] trouble with
[54:01] with you know saying talking to my
[54:04] father as
[54:05] a spirit like like one
[54:08] i remember anton one day he said y'all
[54:10] crazy people said you
[54:12] you uh asked god a petition
[54:15] for healing and said you asked it in the
[54:17] name of the father and said in the
[54:19] minutes you put in there in the name of
[54:20] the son and said
[54:21] when you get the holy ghost in said you
[54:23] got all three trying to deal on one
[54:25] thing
[54:27] i said no that ain't the way it's
[54:29] dealing
[54:31] it's it's what i can talk to him in
[54:33] spirit form
[54:35] can't you compreh can't you uh
[54:37] communicate with god
[54:39] without having to talk yes that's right
[54:43] you will have to admit this i believe
[54:44] it's true the
[54:46] biggest portion of my prayers are silent
[54:48] prayers
[54:51] and i would not never in any way tell
[54:53] you to be that away
[54:54] because it's not it's just a part of me
[54:56] i'm just
[54:58] like that it's just something personal
[55:01] i don't have to go in a closet and i'm
[55:03] not throwing nothing
[55:04] i don't have to get before a picture i
[55:07] don't have to do anything
[55:09] i can be working at general motors i
[55:11] could just be putting motors in where
[55:13] i'd have to grab that hook and sling it
[55:15] in there and jerk that motor up
[55:17] and what eight 900 pounds sling that
[55:19] thing around with my own body
[55:21] sling it over in the frame and god help
[55:23] me and we'd set it down
[55:25] you know i could just be talking to god
[55:31] and saying thank you thank you for
[55:34] what you've let now be made known today
[55:38] and i've always said this i never go to
[55:40] church and i don't get something
[55:42] that's right i don't because
[55:45] i'll get something if there's nothing
[55:47] else then thank you lord
[55:48] for everything because that's the way we
[55:51] ought to be
[55:52] we're to thank him for everything in the
[55:53] world that we have will have or ever
[55:56] anything is is keep him and and rejoice
[55:59] over the fact of what we've got
[56:01] you realized see you're you're younger
[56:04] people coming up you don't understand
[56:06] you know we were life another day uh
[56:08] first job i had when me and my wife got
[56:10] married i made forty dollars a week
[56:14] that was my job forty dollars a week
[56:21] and we paid rent we paid light bill and
[56:24] now on telephone couldn't afford it
[56:27] didn't have a lot of things but you know
[56:29] what we lived
[56:31] you know what my wife she made a lot of
[56:32] the clothes with the kids as we come
[56:34] along
[56:34] and that's what i was thinking about i
[56:35] was just sitting thinking you know
[56:37] lord what is it look what it's been so
[56:39] great to me
[56:40] that i've come from here to here to here
[56:42] to here well that's what i'm trying to
[56:44] do here now and
[56:46] speaking about god and his ways all
[56:48] right
[56:49] see so go ahead for number two
[56:54] just pull up the
[56:59] all right run it on down save time
[57:01] reading okay right there
[57:03] he was other words now let's get down to
[57:07] something
[57:08] that we're talking about forgive me
[57:12] adam the first man in the lower creation
[57:16] of god
[57:18] adam was the first man in the lower
[57:21] creation
[57:22] lower creation means you're dating down
[57:25] to where you start
[57:26] from see look the first creation was god
[57:29] himself
[57:30] he said well well i just said this blows
[57:33] me because
[57:36] how was god ever created he wasn't
[57:38] that's not what you're talking about
[57:41] when god coming into being
[57:45] unveiling himself showing himself
[57:48] revealing himself
[57:50] to where that you can comprehend it
[57:53] the first creation was god himself
[57:58] so that's why we spent so much time in
[57:59] that of going back and saying
[58:01] well what was he back there what did he
[58:03] look like what did he do what did you
[58:05] know
[58:05] and all that trying to get this simple
[58:07] things
[58:08] to hurt of you to understand now back up
[58:12] prior to this he says god is from his
[58:15] point of god as a spirit he said god
[58:17] made a spirit man
[58:19] all right see that's that was his
[58:21] beginning was the spirit man in other
[58:23] words what did he do
[58:25] what did he do he just moved some of
[58:28] himself is
[58:28] how would you how do you think he just
[58:31] moved from this to this
[58:34] he just moved over in another form and
[58:36] as he did it opened up and there he
[58:38] begins to see his family
[58:42] now he's standing back there as to
[58:45] non-existence of any man to comprehend
[58:48] him but he's already got
[58:50] in his mind what he's going to do
[58:54] and how he's going to make his family
[58:57] and
[58:57] and impart himself to his family because
[59:00] that's
[59:01] that's his being and his doing that's
[59:03] what that's the whole thing is to impart
[59:05] himself
[59:08] into you and me see so then in that
[59:11] the first creation was god himself the
[59:14] first thing you can think about coming
[59:16] into being
[59:18] it that would be uh
[59:23] you know tangible i guess tangible would
[59:25] be a word
[59:27] uh that's coming into being something
[59:29] that can be
[59:31] it now i like to hold it that way first
[59:35] watch
[59:36] not not to be seen because he's still in
[59:40] spirit form
[59:42] but so that he could be comprehended
[59:46] and he reveals himself and he begins as
[59:48] he begins
[59:49] see then things start coming into being
[59:52] and he sees all of these things in his
[59:55] mind
[59:56] he knows what the future is going to be
[59:58] he knows all of the things
[1:00:00] before he ever even starts
[1:00:03] why because he's he is the first of that
[1:00:09] creation amen the first one to come into
[1:00:13] being amen
[1:00:14] right see and then by him coming into
[1:00:17] being that means we're going to come
[1:00:18] into being
[1:00:19] amen we're coming into being because
[1:00:22] we're a part of him
[1:00:24] all right and see look what it's saying
[1:00:26] then
[1:00:28] he was in other words adam the first man
[1:00:30] in the lower creation
[1:00:31] it was the first human thing first
[1:00:34] mortal thing
[1:00:35] in the basis of the humanity now not
[1:00:37] dogs cats that
[1:00:38] was ever created first but the humanity
[1:00:42] side
[1:00:43] doesn't matter what you put it in adam
[1:00:45] would be
[1:00:46] the beginning all right now
[1:00:50] he said the first creation was god
[1:00:51] himself then out of god
[1:00:53] came the logos
[1:00:56] which was the son of god
[1:01:01] now how can god be comprehended
[1:01:05] according to what we read in john the
[1:01:08] son
[1:01:10] has brought him into the open
[1:01:14] or showed him revealed him
[1:01:17] made him all right see then out of god
[1:01:19] came the lord
[1:01:20] the word which was the son of god then
[1:01:23] out of the logos which was the word
[1:01:25] so just think about it you say well did
[1:01:28] the word have to come into being
[1:01:30] not come into being like there never was
[1:01:32] a word he always was the word
[1:01:34] amen that's what i love about john 1. i
[1:01:36] love it the way brother adam says
[1:01:38] let's see in the beginning with elohim
[1:01:40] elohim was with god and elohim was god i
[1:01:42] believe that's a term then
[1:01:44] see it's always been god
[1:01:47] the word has always been that you just
[1:01:50] don't understand church
[1:01:52] how marvelous to conceive
[1:01:57] that god would reveal himself
[1:02:00] to mankind
[1:02:06] can he come through the word to you
[1:02:08] because the word logos and all of those
[1:02:10] come back to the word speech
[1:02:14] all right and see he he spoke us
[1:02:18] into existence
[1:02:22] back there he said no that puts us back
[1:02:25] no no no no you're the one that's going
[1:02:27] wrong see
[1:02:28] i'm still in his mind i'm still in the
[1:02:32] spirit realm
[1:02:32] you don't got off into the land come on
[1:02:34] back with me now get back over here
[1:02:36] to where you can stay in the land that
[1:02:38] i'm talking about the spirit land
[1:02:41] to where we can see how god is a spirit
[1:02:46] but yet he begins to unveil himself
[1:02:50] but you know what i like no
[1:02:54] what was his first creation
[1:02:58] a spirit man why
[1:03:02] because he was spirit
[1:03:06] see the first part of your being
[1:03:08] whatever you want to call it when we
[1:03:09] talk about body spirit soul
[1:03:10] etcetera thing you realize the first
[1:03:12] part of your being in spirit realm
[1:03:17] is the realm that god was in when he
[1:03:20] began to create
[1:03:23] the spirit realm the place that you can
[1:03:28] and that's why we talk about and we put
[1:03:30] the emphasis and i believe it's there
[1:03:32] of the soul is the main part of the
[1:03:34] human being
[1:03:35] i believe that you know i believe that's
[1:03:37] your being because i believe the soul
[1:03:40] can
[1:03:40] condescend deeper into understanding
[1:03:43] than the
[1:03:44] body and spirit but yet the spirit
[1:03:49] is a marvelous thing your spirit within
[1:03:53] you is a marvelous thing you realize
[1:03:55] that you
[1:03:55] that it keeps you alive that it
[1:03:58] it operates through you and does things
[1:04:01] and and you can do it
[1:04:02] in the spirit realm so don't ever get to
[1:04:04] the point of saying well we don't need
[1:04:06] the spirit
[1:04:08] no i've just always taught you what i
[1:04:11] believe
[1:04:12] i believe that adam's soul was eternal
[1:04:14] because the prophet said it blasphemous
[1:04:16] names
[1:04:17] all right eve so would then would have
[1:04:20] been eternal with everything from then
[1:04:21] on
[1:04:22] mortal but you know what
[1:04:26] even a mortal with any contact of god in
[1:04:30] a spirit realm
[1:04:32] is a marvelous you realize that
[1:04:35] everything in the world is created by
[1:04:36] thoughts of mankind
[1:04:41] right thoughts of mankind brings into
[1:04:44] being all of the things that we have in
[1:04:45] the world cars
[1:04:47] you know electricity everything is
[1:04:49] brought in because it's
[1:04:51] part of god i'm all right go ahead
[1:04:56] go ahead to number three
[1:05:00] just pull it on up to the orange part
[1:05:02] because that's the main you can listen
[1:05:04] to it backwards forward and see if i'm
[1:05:05] all for what but yeah now
[1:05:08] no one has seen god
[1:05:13] and now the next thing we begin to see
[1:05:16] by eyes of supernatural
[1:05:20] looking we see a little white
[1:05:23] light forming out there
[1:05:27] what is that that was called by bible
[1:05:30] readers
[1:05:31] logos or anointed or the anointing
[1:05:36] or as i was going to say the part of
[1:05:39] god began to develop into something
[1:05:42] so human beings could have some type of
[1:05:45] an idea
[1:05:47] what it was now to me that's a definite
[1:05:50] i mean that to me that that takes so
[1:05:52] theologian sets him aside over here and
[1:05:54] says
[1:05:55] this hush you don't understand what's
[1:05:58] going on
[1:05:59] let's get with with the man that can
[1:06:01] break it down to where we can understand
[1:06:03] it because that's what he said
[1:06:06] and look what he done said little light
[1:06:09] moving
[1:06:10] he was a word that was the word look now
[1:06:13] god gave himself
[1:06:14] birth to his son
[1:06:17] now remember what it was son of god
[1:06:21] it's not back there now he's not back
[1:06:23] there he's not a baby that plots out in
[1:06:25] the
[1:06:25] human elements now we're still in the
[1:06:27] spirit realm
[1:06:29] right right see god gave himself birth
[1:06:33] to this son which was before there was
[1:06:35] even an
[1:06:36] adam in the air or to make an adam
[1:06:40] see that was jesus said glorify me
[1:06:42] father with the glory
[1:06:43] that we had before the foundation of the
[1:06:45] world way back in yonder
[1:06:48] think about it
[1:06:52] almighty god wanting to dwell with his
[1:06:56] humanity
[1:06:58] that gets me it makes it breaks my heart
[1:07:01] to think
[1:07:02] how that we've degraded it so much of
[1:07:05] what we've done with it with mankind
[1:07:07] but yet that he's been so marvelous and
[1:07:10] wonderful to reveal himself
[1:07:13] and to bring it down
[1:07:16] and to promise that he'd sent us a
[1:07:18] prophet because he knew we wouldn't be
[1:07:20] able to understand him
[1:07:21] he knew with a prophet that it would be
[1:07:24] hard to understand
[1:07:26] so he sent a prophet with simplicity
[1:07:29] language thoughts
[1:07:33] his hands and carries and totes and the
[1:07:35] things you know
[1:07:37] that didn't bother me like i've always
[1:07:39] said you go up north and you say
[1:07:42] uh you know to them and they say what do
[1:07:44] you want to eat so
[1:07:45] well i want some maters and taters
[1:07:49] and they'll look at you and
[1:07:54] maters and taters yes i want some maters
[1:07:56] and taters
[1:07:58] they'll go off grinning and giggling
[1:08:02] right calls your language
[1:08:05] but they don't bring you soup they bring
[1:08:09] you
[1:08:09] maters and taters
[1:08:12] it's the different language they want to
[1:08:14] say tomato
[1:08:16] and potato well okay
[1:08:20] that's found me getting my maters and
[1:08:22] taters
[1:08:24] ain't got no problem we were up there
[1:08:26] one time this guy said
[1:08:27] i'll cook anything in the world y'all
[1:08:28] won't he said but i don't do grits
[1:08:31] because you could see he was contrary to
[1:08:33] southern terminologies
[1:08:36] he said i don't do grips all right let's
[1:08:39] get on a little bit further
[1:08:40] go ahead to number four we'll just take
[1:08:42] some of these and then i'll take it next
[1:08:44] time
[1:08:46] notice god is fixing to make another
[1:08:48] creation
[1:08:51] he creating mortal earth mortal life
[1:08:54] angels sing in heaven
[1:08:57] but here he's creating a new life
[1:09:01] eternal life for man
[1:09:05] now what about creating eternal life
[1:09:08] for man in other words won't you use it
[1:09:11] this way
[1:09:12] he's going to bring into being
[1:09:15] eternal life
[1:09:18] all right but here he's creating a new
[1:09:22] life eternal life for a man
[1:09:24] and he's singing to his subjects through
[1:09:26] angels on the earth
[1:09:28] not in heaven and not in heaven heaven
[1:09:32] had eternal life
[1:09:34] but when you moved eternal life to earth
[1:09:35] and that baby was laying there
[1:09:37] and then he could come and sing because
[1:09:40] that was what he was creating very laid
[1:09:42] in that little
[1:09:43] cradle he sang to the heavens
[1:09:46] when the mortal creation came in and
[1:09:49] here the immortal creation is coming in
[1:09:52] and now they're singing to the earthly
[1:09:54] people
[1:09:56] the first thing to shepherds isn't that
[1:09:58] wonderful
[1:09:59] to think about a mortal
[1:10:04] an immortal being revealing himself to
[1:10:07] immort
[1:10:08] to uh an immortal being to revealing
[1:10:11] himself to just a mortal being
[1:10:14] to where we can understand so we can
[1:10:16] hold it together and keep it in line
[1:10:19] all right go ahead for number five
[1:10:24] excuse me yeah number five
[1:10:33] the holy blood that was created by god
[1:10:36] the blood the life the creation of god
[1:10:40] jesus was the beginning of the creation
[1:10:43] of god
[1:10:44] oh you see it god made
[1:10:47] in creation
[1:10:51] coming into his creation coming into his
[1:10:54] part
[1:10:54] he was spirit the bible said he's the
[1:10:56] beginning of the creation of god
[1:10:58] how did he begin he began in the wombs
[1:11:02] of a woman which is what the woman is
[1:11:05] not
[1:11:06] you think about it
[1:11:09] why did he say wounds
[1:11:15] yeah why did the prophet say wounds that
[1:11:18] makes him exactly right
[1:11:20] so that he can come over to uh what is
[1:11:23] it
[1:11:23] i'll think of it in a minute about the
[1:11:26] spoken word
[1:11:28] look the natural wound
[1:11:31] and the spiritual one the wounds
[1:11:35] of a woman mary had to accept
[1:11:40] in her spiritual wound the point of the
[1:11:43] child to be born and what god would do
[1:11:46] then she had to accept in her physical
[1:11:49] wound
[1:11:50] so what about he's back over here in the
[1:11:52] middle of the message somewhere and he
[1:11:54] just
[1:11:54] drops it and goes on well to me i when
[1:11:57] i'm studying
[1:11:58] i don't look for something like that it
[1:12:00] just finds you i'm i'm kind of like my
[1:12:03] wife
[1:12:04] uh you go to the store
[1:12:07] with my wife and what did they used to
[1:12:10] do the blue flag
[1:12:11] but anyhow you walk in the front door
[1:12:13] with my wife and she goes stink
[1:12:16] and there's a lot in the back going
[1:12:19] not really but it just he and here she
[1:12:22] goes
[1:12:25] sails she finds the sails they find her
[1:12:30] she don't have to hunt them they find
[1:12:34] hers kind of like that man told me a
[1:12:35] part
[1:12:36] uh hamricks that time he said i sure
[1:12:38] hope they don't
[1:12:39] nobody don't rob this place
[1:12:43] well i do too but what do you mean
[1:12:47] he said cause my wife fingerprints is on
[1:12:50] everything in here
[1:12:53] so that's the way women are okay
[1:12:56] all right but listen see the wounds of a
[1:13:00] woman
[1:13:02] word did the beginning of the creation
[1:13:04] of god start at then
[1:13:06] in the wound of a woman
[1:13:10] she gave birth to the very
[1:13:14] part that should have been go ahead
[1:13:17] number six
[1:13:24] jesus christ is the beginning of the
[1:13:26] creation of god
[1:13:27] revelation 1 is that right then when was
[1:13:30] when was god created
[1:13:32] he is the beginning of the creation of
[1:13:34] god
[1:13:36] and god is eternal is that right
[1:13:40] but when did what but when
[1:13:43] god was created
[1:13:47] now you're going to deal with a mortal
[1:13:49] part
[1:13:50] of god bringing into being something
[1:13:54] that will be
[1:13:55] of the part that he has to have to be
[1:13:58] able to exist with the mankind
[1:14:00] because if he's going to create mankind
[1:14:03] he's going to have to be with mankind
[1:14:05] spirit realm he can be with them because
[1:14:07] they're spirit
[1:14:08] but he's coming into mortal thinking of
[1:14:11] what he's doing so listen
[1:14:12] but when god was created
[1:14:16] when was god created see when a little
[1:14:19] baby
[1:14:20] that was conceived in the wound of a
[1:14:22] mother a virgin
[1:14:24] and she began to develop these cells
[1:14:25] into her to bring forth this
[1:14:28] little baby that was the beginning of
[1:14:31] god's creation
[1:14:32] where god was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:14:35] us
[1:14:36] and became emmanuel god with us
[1:14:40] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:14:43] when did god have a beginning he doesn't
[1:14:45] have a beginning
[1:14:48] he has a time to come forth into
[1:14:52] time
[1:14:55] into a situation of life
[1:14:58] but he never begun because he was
[1:15:00] eternal to start with
[1:15:04] see he was eternal to start with he was
[1:15:07] back there
[1:15:08] all right and in all of that being you
[1:15:11] think about it
[1:15:12] think about all of that being because i
[1:15:14] know i've been questioning this for
[1:15:17] 40 years about god back there and what
[1:15:20] did he wear and what did he do
[1:15:21] and what did he say and how did he and
[1:15:23] i've always tried to explain one thing
[1:15:28] god wanted to make himself known
[1:15:33] and in doing that he would have to have
[1:15:36] a certain plan
[1:15:38] and way to do so he would make it
[1:15:40] manifest
[1:15:42] through the simplicity and he'd bring it
[1:15:44] right into mankind
[1:15:47] right so now think about see stage one
[1:15:51] we talk about before the world and him
[1:15:53] stepping forth from behind all of that
[1:15:56] or whatever him coming forth into that
[1:15:58] to wreak himself known
[1:16:01] all right we stopped it remember i kept
[1:16:02] emphasizing spirit
[1:16:04] spirit spirit all right
[1:16:08] but see now that would bring us to a
[1:16:10] place
[1:16:11] that we could fellowship in spirit
[1:16:14] right we could fellowship in spirit
[1:16:17] because
[1:16:18] we would be his spirit offspring and
[1:16:21] fellowship with
[1:16:22] but there's more to it amen see because
[1:16:25] in that spirit realm he
[1:16:27] he he already back before all of that
[1:16:29] come into being
[1:16:30] he was a father he was a healer he was a
[1:16:33] savior he was all that
[1:16:34] so all of that had to come into being so
[1:16:37] we only got to the part that spirit man
[1:16:39] could come into being
[1:16:40] and adam could come into being in the
[1:16:42] garden
[1:16:43] all right and be placed over the animals
[1:16:46] in the
[1:16:47] i read it to you there in the spirit
[1:16:49] realm see
[1:16:51] because he's a spirit so he could
[1:16:52] fellowship with man
[1:16:54] with that and god could come down and
[1:16:56] fellowship with him
[1:16:57] and everything but then he had to make
[1:17:00] him a body
[1:17:03] because that wasn't enough see he made a
[1:17:06] body
[1:17:08] because he knew he was going to make a
[1:17:10] body to come live in
[1:17:13] he knew he was going to do that because
[1:17:15] that would be the point
[1:17:17] and mankind would come forth into being
[1:17:21] but we stick more with
[1:17:22] to just try to keep the point stage two
[1:17:25] what god coming in to mortal being
[1:17:33] back there all of that old testament
[1:17:37] you study it you get in there and you
[1:17:38] get into finding god in his reality
[1:17:42] of being i've always said it this way
[1:17:44] you can find god in
[1:17:46] in studying because who was the the
[1:17:48] fourth man in the fire you you can get
[1:17:51] uh literal things you know
[1:17:54] you can get into those things and and
[1:17:56] study them you can study it
[1:17:58] in the the spirit of mankind because uh
[1:18:02] the psalmist would ride of the spirit
[1:18:03] and the things that would take place and
[1:18:05] how he was and what was doing
[1:18:07] and all but the soul of man is is not
[1:18:10] mentioned a whole lot in the old
[1:18:11] testament
[1:18:12] it's dire but it's not mentioned a lot
[1:18:14] but see then it gradually comes forth
[1:18:17] into being to see the reality of a
[1:18:20] living god
[1:18:21] because god is real
[1:18:24] and when that body was created
[1:18:29] a spirit steps into the body
[1:18:33] the body's not eternal but the spirit
[1:18:36] steps into the body
[1:18:37] a soul steps into the body
[1:18:40] now you've got body spirit and soul
[1:18:43] in the way that god would want it to be
[1:18:46] to where that he could be
[1:18:47] mortal
[1:18:52] and then he could fulfill the scriptures
[1:18:54] that would talk about him that god was
[1:18:56] in christ reconciling the world unto
[1:18:57] himself
[1:18:59] so he could start coming into being as
[1:19:01] to what he really wanted
[1:19:03] he wanted to fellowship with us amen you
[1:19:06] remember that
[1:19:07] i said that a little bit ago he's lonely
[1:19:10] it didn't matter how great it was back
[1:19:12] there
[1:19:14] i mean i laid up here in the hospital
[1:19:16] and i thought i'd like for somebody to
[1:19:18] keep the walls down where i know what's
[1:19:20] going on around here because i'm i'm
[1:19:22] i'm messed up and it wasn't
[1:19:26] much of my head messed up it was just
[1:19:28] everything there was messed up
[1:19:30] i mean i'd asked for something and you
[1:19:32] know i kept trying to tell them i said
[1:19:33] look
[1:19:34] what all mind just getting me some claws
[1:19:37] and getting out of the way
[1:19:39] you know what i meant get me some
[1:19:41] washcloths and some soap and get out of
[1:19:43] my way
[1:19:45] y'all go leave the room i'll take care
[1:19:47] of everything
[1:19:48] you know lady said i can't do it
[1:19:52] said you you got all these things
[1:19:56] and that was what was so funny i could
[1:19:58] sneeze she'd open the door
[1:20:01] i mean she would just bought us like
[1:20:02] that as quick as i'd sneeze or move
[1:20:04] because all that was hooked up i reckon
[1:20:06] they thought about gonna die or
[1:20:08] something and
[1:20:09] they had it all hooked up wondering
[1:20:10] what's going on but uh it was fun
[1:20:13] but it wouldn't okay
[1:20:16] i just hope nobody has to go through
[1:20:18] those things
[1:20:20] because it's it's all right but now
[1:20:23] listen
[1:20:24] let's get this point and then we'll quit
[1:20:26] in a minute okay
[1:20:28] see we go from stage one of god moving
[1:20:31] in
[1:20:31] from the unknown the supernatural
[1:20:34] thing moving over into rims
[1:20:38] that he can be comprehended all right
[1:20:41] we got to the spirit realm all right he
[1:20:44] could be comprehended
[1:20:46] in the spirit realm because he was
[1:20:47] spirit
[1:20:49] all right see then that would not be the
[1:20:52] end of it because that would not fulfill
[1:20:55] a spirit he couldn't die for our sins he
[1:20:57] couldn't do this he couldn't do that and
[1:20:59] all of the things
[1:21:00] that he was already had to be he could
[1:21:03] not have brought them into being to step
[1:21:05] to stayed in to the rims of the spirit
[1:21:08] realm
[1:21:09] so he had to bring it into the natural
[1:21:11] realm
[1:21:12] and when he did then you see adam coming
[1:21:15] into being
[1:21:16] you see eve coming in to be and you see
[1:21:20] as i said a while ago then about it that
[1:21:22] adam i believe according to blasphemous
[1:21:24] names read it
[1:21:25] that adam's soul was eternal that's
[1:21:28] right all right
[1:21:29] and eve being a part of adam i believe
[1:21:31] her soul was eternal
[1:21:33] because brother brown said her ease so
[1:21:36] was in
[1:21:36] adam now not in adam like two people
[1:21:40] standing
[1:21:41] trying to find out who's what no
[1:21:45] but see god just simply reached down
[1:21:49] and took from that body and brought
[1:21:52] forth an eve
[1:21:54] but he brought her forth in the correct
[1:21:56] order he said do you believe that eve's
[1:21:58] soul is eternal well the prophet said
[1:22:01] that adam's soul was eternal well were
[1:22:03] you going to put eve
[1:22:04] and then you go to questions and answers
[1:22:06] and
[1:22:08] genesis and he'll tell you that he was
[1:22:10] in adam and theophany
[1:22:13] well where adam was he was and if
[1:22:16] according to the prophet
[1:22:17] of that message book that he says your
[1:22:19] soul is your theophany
[1:22:22] all right see then they could have
[1:22:25] eternal life in their soul
[1:22:29] and look what would have happened um
[1:22:31] just
[1:22:32] give you a little run through look what
[1:22:34] would have happened had adam and eve not
[1:22:36] sinned
[1:22:38] do you realize what was standing there
[1:22:43] do you realize god's family was standing
[1:22:45] there
[1:22:48] adam with the ability not to
[1:22:52] have children as we call it that's you
[1:22:55] you do what you want to what would would
[1:22:57] have been what i'm i'm just saying it
[1:22:59] this way
[1:23:01] if it hadn't been for the fall and
[1:23:04] things
[1:23:06] adam and eve could have produced spoken
[1:23:09] word children
[1:23:11] and all of us would have been brought
[1:23:12] into being okay
[1:23:14] but you know what would be we would be
[1:23:17] like adam and eve
[1:23:19] we would be body mortal
[1:23:23] soul eternal spirit needing
[1:23:26] eternity having a lot of dealings with
[1:23:29] it but needing it
[1:23:31] well what if what if it happened that
[1:23:34] adam and eve didn't sin
[1:23:36] okay see then we could have all went to
[1:23:39] the tree of life because the tree of
[1:23:40] life was already in the garden
[1:23:42] i love that the tree of life was already
[1:23:44] in the garden
[1:23:45] we could have went to the tree of life
[1:23:46] and ate of the tree of life and come
[1:23:48] forth with
[1:23:49] eternal bodies because that's exactly
[1:23:52] what we're doing now
[1:23:54] we are eating the word of god
[1:23:57] and eating that word is going to make
[1:24:00] these bodies
[1:24:01] eternal that's right amen
[1:24:06] and see in doing that it's a wonderful
[1:24:08] day to realize the time in the position
[1:24:12] but he had to stop now to get my point
[1:24:13] for just a minute he had to stop at that
[1:24:15] stage
[1:24:16] of bringing forth a body
[1:24:20] because he was a father he was a son he
[1:24:23] was a human
[1:24:24] and to do that he'd have to have a
[1:24:26] mortal body
[1:24:28] so the old testament would see things
[1:24:30] moving in and out and speak of it
[1:24:32] but then all at once here comes a virgin
[1:24:35] bringing forth a child
[1:24:37] bringing forth a little feller yes and
[1:24:40] that little fella wound up being god
[1:24:42] almighty in human flesh
[1:24:44] i love the prophet when he says you're
[1:24:46] god with no teeth
[1:24:48] i do what i now forgive me okay
[1:24:53] i'm sorry that i sometimes life but i
[1:24:56] try to do it inwardly where everybody
[1:24:57] don't know what i'm lying
[1:24:59] because you know it tickles me to death
[1:25:02] to
[1:25:02] see people try to explain the godhead
[1:25:06] and you hear them trying to explain it
[1:25:08] and when they get through explaining you
[1:25:11] that sure is a mystery you know
[1:25:14] that's a mystery how that could be what
[1:25:16] do you realize
[1:25:18] all it was summed up and brought in
[1:25:20] jesus christ so let's stop at that point
[1:25:22] then we'll take the others
[1:25:24] jesus christ was god made
[1:25:28] manifest in human flesh
[1:25:32] no more and no less
[1:25:35] all that was ever needed or ever
[1:25:37] wouldn't it be needed or anything to be
[1:25:39] done
[1:25:39] was right turn that man he was the
[1:25:42] healer the savior the all of the things
[1:25:45] that god had in the beginning that he
[1:25:47] wanted to make manifest
[1:25:50] he couldn't do it as a baby so they
[1:25:53] could
[1:25:54] make fun of him he couldn't do it
[1:25:57] as a young child and coming on up and
[1:26:01] couldn't do it even when he got on up in
[1:26:02] a certain ages and
[1:26:04] they'd make fun of him and you know oh
[1:26:07] you're just a
[1:26:09] illegitimate baby and he'd say okay
[1:26:13] i'll forgive you i said now one day the
[1:26:15] holy ghost would come and says it's not
[1:26:17] going to forgive you
[1:26:18] but they didn't care but he said i'll
[1:26:20] forgive you i know you
[1:26:22] don't understand what would it be
[1:26:25] to take to try to explain you know i
[1:26:27] don't mean wrong but for brother donny
[1:26:29] to try to explain
[1:26:30] how to take that car apart and put it
[1:26:34] back together right here
[1:26:36] and not leave no parts out in it run
[1:26:40] richard done that one time with a motor
[1:26:41] and it actually run i told him i'm
[1:26:43] surprised
[1:26:45] but you see what i'm getting now that
[1:26:47] you got
[1:26:49] all of these things to bring it to this
[1:26:51] stage
[1:26:52] now when you get to that stage you just
[1:26:54] all you do is you just put it on the
[1:26:56] hole for about 2000 years
[1:27:00] and you come through all of the things
[1:27:03] that would have to do with it
[1:27:04] the jobs and the and the abraham and
[1:27:08] moses and all of the things and you
[1:27:11] bring all of that
[1:27:12] and that's word that i love with the way
[1:27:14] the prophet would say he said and the
[1:27:17] prophets built the body
[1:27:21] now that's something to me that the
[1:27:24] prophets
[1:27:26] built the body but one day that body
[1:27:29] stood down
[1:27:31] he said unless you see that i am he
[1:27:32] you'll die in your sins
[1:27:35] they had to crucify him he couldn't go
[1:27:37] no other way
[1:27:39] but yet think about it that he is still
[1:27:42] at that stage
[1:27:45] they said show us the father and suffice
[1:27:46] he said have i been so long with you
[1:27:49] so don't you understand don't you
[1:27:51] understand all these things that's been
[1:27:52] taking place around here
[1:27:54] and all the healings and the signs and
[1:27:56] the different things that's taking place
[1:27:58] and you're wanting me to tell you to try
[1:28:00] to reveal me to you he said
[1:28:02] you're to understand it by just looking
[1:28:04] and seeing what's going on
[1:28:07] and knowing it let's stand together come
[1:28:09] on musician
[1:28:10] i hope you you know i hope you caught
[1:28:14] something
[1:28:16] from the point because
[1:28:19] all i want you to see is god made
[1:28:22] manifest
[1:28:25] and you have to see that in stages
[1:28:31] see you could look down there at him and
[1:28:33] say that's almighty god well that's true
[1:28:37] but he wouldn't make it manifest
[1:28:40] you need to wait until you can make
[1:28:41] manifest
[1:28:43] anybody have a need before we go and
[1:28:45] just pray one for another
[1:28:48] thank you yeah all right we're going to
[1:28:51] have communion now

[1:32:01] you that the lord jesus the same night
[1:32:03] in which he was betrayed took bread
[1:32:05] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:32:07] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:32:09] is broken for you
[1:32:11] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:32:14] same manner also he took the cup that he
[1:32:16] had sucked
[1:32:16] saying this cup is the new testament in
[1:32:20] my blood
[1:32:21] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:32:23] remembrance
[1:32:24] of me this is not just a ritual we're
[1:32:26] supposed to remember
[1:32:28] what jesus christ did for us for as
[1:32:30] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:32:32] this cup you do show the lord's death
[1:32:34] till he come
[1:32:35] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:32:37] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:32:38] unworthily
[1:32:40] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:32:41] the lord now what's the body of the lord
[1:32:43] you and i all right and we're the blood
[1:32:47] by the spirit as we said a couple of
[1:32:48] sundays ago so
[1:32:49] it this includes us the bride of jesus
[1:32:51] christ this is not something we do
[1:32:54] we all we all are a part of the body and
[1:32:57] blood of the lord and if we eat and
[1:32:59] drink unworthily we're guilty of the
[1:33:00] body and blood of the lord but let a man
[1:33:02] examine himself
[1:33:03] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:33:05] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:33:06] drinketh unworthily
[1:33:08] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:33:11] not discerning the lord's body for this
[1:33:13] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:33:15] in many sleep
[1:33:16] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:33:18] should not be judged
[1:33:20] but when we are judged we are chasing of
[1:33:22] the lord that we should not be condemned
[1:33:24] with this world
[1:33:25] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:33:26] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:33:29] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:33:30] home that you come not together into
[1:33:33] condemnation and the rest will i set an
[1:33:34] order
[1:33:36] when i come so let's just take a moment
[1:33:37] of silent prayer
[1:33:39] brother brown says pray clear your mind
[1:33:42] and also pray for your pastor amen so
[1:33:45] let's
[1:33:46] let's take a moment i'll pray
[1:34:00] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[1:34:05] the bible says he took bread and blessed
[1:34:06] it heavenly father we thank you for this
[1:34:08] bread lord has been
[1:34:09] prepared father to do one thing and
[1:34:12] that's for us to partake in this
[1:34:13] communion lord
[1:34:14] and we pray now that you would just be
[1:34:16] with us lord and furthermore this
[1:34:17] service lord as we break this bread we
[1:34:19] know lord
[1:34:20] that your body was broken for us and
[1:34:22] lord if anyone has an infirmity lord
[1:34:24] here in this building father are
[1:34:25] listening to us tonight
[1:34:26] today lord we pray that you will just
[1:34:28] heal their body lord
[1:34:30] as you were broken for us father you're
[1:34:32] going to put us back together lord yes
[1:34:34] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[1:34:54] don't remember brother bob wins tonight
[1:34:55] he's preaching for us
[1:34:59] nor does a as we always say give us our
[1:35:01] daily bread
[1:35:03] our daily bread is not this bread here
[1:35:04] but it's the bread we just heard
[1:35:06] amen jesus said i am that bread to come
[1:35:09] from heaven
[1:35:11] we can eat natural bread and we'll be
[1:35:13] hungry in the next few hours
[1:35:15] but if we use the spiritual bread he
[1:35:17] said you'll never hunger
[1:35:25] thank the lord for the hands that
[1:35:26] prepare this i i can remember
[1:35:29] uh sitting on the counter in
[1:35:33] in galesville in the house upon the hill
[1:35:34] there and we just we were in the baptist
[1:35:36] church and we left there in 68 but
[1:35:38] during that time
[1:35:39] i think we were the ones that kind of
[1:35:41] held the communion and we'd buy the
[1:35:42] little
[1:35:43] we daddy would buy little things in a
[1:35:45] box and there'd be little cracker things
[1:35:48] and
[1:35:48] and they would get them out them out
[1:35:51] well it's kind of spiritual in it
[1:35:53] thaw them out and uh well that's all
[1:35:56] they need to do
[1:35:57] right and and then get the grape juice
[1:35:59] and then when you got the grape juice
[1:36:00] out they'd have to cut grape juice to
[1:36:02] make sure that
[1:36:03] it didn't choke anybody so um you see
[1:36:06] what but see that's a
[1:36:07] that's a uh a type of them diluting the
[1:36:10] word of god
[1:36:11] we don't dilute the word of god we use
[1:36:13] fresh wine right
[1:36:15] we use fresh bread and it's prepared by
[1:36:17] by
[1:36:18] we don't know that could have been made
[1:36:19] whoever that was made for that in
[1:36:21] in back in that time but but this was
[1:36:25] made fresh
[1:36:25] and then it will be burned in the
[1:36:27] evening after we get finished with it
[1:36:29] nothing will be held over
[1:36:31] because we want fresh man in the morning
[1:36:33] even though we're not in church we still
[1:36:35] want fresh manna in the morning
[1:36:36] i mean you want like brother dale said
[1:36:38] whether you're on your lawnmower or in
[1:36:40] your chicken truck or wherever you
[1:36:41] you're at let god speak to you fresh
[1:36:43] manna
[1:36:44] the heavenly father thank you for this
[1:36:47] wine lord
[1:36:48] that has been made lord by holy hands
[1:36:51] and just went through a process that you
[1:36:53] lord instituted that we drink it until
[1:36:55] you come father because this wine it
[1:36:57] gets better with age
[1:36:59] it does not lord it does not
