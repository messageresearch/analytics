[6:13] what to do and it tells you what to
[6:15] bring so you know then you don't have no
[6:18] excuse to come up and say well I didn't
[6:20] bring no

[6:25] responsible for your children to bring
[6:28] them drinks we Supply food and all kind
[6:31] of things but have tea and water we have
[6:33] tea and water but uh make sure you bring
[6:37] drinks for your kids because that way
[6:39] you don't want the kids going around and
[6:41] not being able to drink a drink cuz you
[6:44] didn't bring them and then some other
[6:46] kids has got drinks that they brought
[6:48] them so you know get everything straight
[6:50] and have it all do and we always have a
[6:53] wonderful time uh fishing and
[6:56] fellowshipping together it always turns
[6:58] out real good so we just pray that the
[7:00] Lord would bless okay Matthew
[7:04] 14 we'll begin with verse 22 father we
[7:08] thank you for all of the day and the
[7:10] time that we've had thank you for the
[7:12] word that you have given unto us we ask
[7:15] you now that you would just bless each
[7:17] and every one of us with your
[7:19] understanding and your grace and your
[7:20] love and father that we may be able
[7:24] to follow you in the opening of your
[7:28] word because that's a our desire more
[7:30] than
[7:31] anything is to walk in the light then
[7:34] that way we can have Fellowship one with
[7:35] another in the blood of Jesus Christ
[7:37] will atone for all of our sins we ask
[7:40] you now to just help us give us
[7:42] understanding ears and just bless each
[7:44] one Lord we commit it all to you now
[7:47] forgive our sins bless those that are
[7:49] not here and remember them and Lord
[7:52] remember the sick among us we pray that
[7:54] you would touch each one CU you made the
[7:56] promise you said you sent your word we
[7:59] believe you've done that so now come on
[8:01] the scene to touch and heal each and
[8:03] every one we love you and we thank you
[8:05] in Jesus name amen amen Matthew
[8:10] 14 we'll go with verse 22 everybody
[8:14] knows this scripture real well and uh
[8:17] we'll get to our point in a little while
[8:20] of what we're talking
[8:23] about verse 22 says and Je and
[8:26] straightway Jesus constrained his
[8:28] disciples to get into a ship
[8:30] and go before him unto the other side
[8:33] while he sent the multitude away and
[8:36] when he had sent the multitude away he
[8:37] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[8:40] and when the evening was come he was
[8:41] there alone but the ship was now in the
[8:43] midst of the sea talks with waves for
[8:46] the wind was contrary but in the Fourth
[8:48] Watch of the night Jesus came unto them
[8:51] walking on the sea and when the
[8:53] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[8:56] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[8:59] and they cried out for
[9:00] fear but straightway Jesus spake unto
[9:03] them saying be of good cheer it is I Be
[9:06] not Afraid and Peter answered him and
[9:09] said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto
[9:13] thee on the water and he said
[9:16] come now I don't
[9:19] need you try to preach and you get
[9:22] caught with it uh remember we were
[9:24] talking about the coming of the Lord and
[9:27] it wouldn't do no good for for you to
[9:29] say come to somebody you know that
[9:32] wasn't standing there
[9:34] personal you know I tried to get the
[9:36] word come over to you to where you could
[9:37] see it all right and he said come and
[9:39] when Peter was come down out of the ship
[9:41] he walked on the water to go to Jesus
[9:44] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[9:46] was afraid and he began to sink he cried
[9:49] saying Lord save me and immediately
[9:51] Jesus stretched forth his hand and
[9:53] caught him and said unto him oh thou of
[9:56] little faith wherefore this thou doubt
[10:00] and when they were coming to the ship
[10:03] the wind ceased you may be seated the
[10:05] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[10:07] the word
[10:10] now we'll get to our point in a minute
[10:13] but this is a a good favorite scripture
[10:16] of everybody you know Jesus walking on
[10:19] the water and ever a little Baptist
[10:22] preacher that ever started out preaching
[10:25] probably his first sermon was Jesus
[10:27] walking on the water you you know and
[10:30] you've probably heard that 49,000 times
[10:32] in your life of ministers using Jesus
[10:36] walking on the water and that's good not
[10:39] throwing off on it just making the point
[10:41] but we'll get down to what we want to
[10:43] talk about for a little bit but I want
[10:44] to review a little bit Wednesday night
[10:47] to make sure that you follow me and know
[10:51] what I'm trying to say and all cuz in
[10:54] that message we were covering on as I
[10:57] said the word come doesn't mean a
[11:00] traveling form as we talk about it
[11:02] literally means to be here it's not
[11:05] something over there when I say to you I
[11:07] say you know uh brother Danny uh come to
[11:11] see me I have that doesn't mean anything
[11:13] to do with the travel he's the one
[11:15] that's doing it so it's his presence I'm
[11:17] talking about not just a perusia parcia
[11:22] meaning as some of them had because that
[11:24] means someone standing beside of you I
[11:26] don't want God standing beside of me
[11:29] kill me he would have to I want him
[11:32] living inside of me and then that way I
[11:36] don't have to worry about it and see I
[11:38] believe the second coming of Jesus
[11:40] Christ to the bride started on the day
[11:42] of Pentecost in the new birth and when
[11:46] that new birth comes to each individual
[11:48] God is coming to you amen all right then
[11:50] he finishes his coming in the end time
[11:53] to take us away all right now but what I
[11:57] tried to get a point across was of how
[11:59] wonderful I thought and then you'll see
[12:02] why that we're going to start on a
[12:05] probably no telling how long series I
[12:07] thought I was going to preach one sermon
[12:10] and uh already got four so I ain't
[12:13] worried about it but we're going to be
[12:15] talking for a while about something that
[12:17] I believe is what we need and I believe
[12:20] we need a positive
[12:24] attitude now uh it's not a mental
[12:28] concept you'll see what I'm talking
[12:29] about it is a positive attitude because
[12:33] anybody in the Bible that ever amounted
[12:36] to anything or anything happened they
[12:39] had to have a positive attitude
[12:41] something there so that's you know that
[12:43] will be our thought and speaking and
[12:47] talking about mental
[12:49] Faith leads to spiritual Revelation but
[12:53] we'll call it positive attitude and keep
[12:57] on to that point it's something I've
[13:00] been thinking on for 45 years and that's
[13:03] reason I'm pretty good on the point of
[13:04] positive if you think of something that
[13:07] long you can figure you you've thought
[13:09] it out pretty good and know because I
[13:11] believe that we should the prophet said
[13:13] when the bride realizes who she is and
[13:16] what she's here
[13:18] for then she will be an invincible
[13:21] Army you know Satan will not be able to
[13:24] conquer her because but she must believe
[13:28] it right amen that's right a statement
[13:30] is
[13:31] wonderful amen but somebody is going to
[13:35] believe it and it will manifest all
[13:37] right now we talked about the great
[13:40] position that this end time people must
[13:46] attain I remember uh son-in-law Richard
[13:49] talking about when he was reading the
[13:51] statue of a perfect man he had read the
[13:53] book and all and probably heard the tape
[13:55] but one day I emphasized a point out of
[13:58] there that brandom says You must have
[14:02] these
[14:04] virtues so it doesn't mean it's just
[14:07] half Hazard it's required all right this
[14:10] age it's required okay now we know
[14:13] what's
[14:14] required well why not try to attain to
[14:16] what's required so you don't get out of
[14:18] G's
[14:20] alac you know it's got to come out of
[14:22] the word of God Amen it have to be the
[14:25] word of God revealed to us amen if it's
[14:27] something greater than all that's been
[14:30] down through
[14:31] time then it would have to be something
[14:35] that would be specifically for this time
[14:38] all right we talked about how
[14:42] that the prophet of God brought the
[14:45] message unto us and we use that as an
[14:49] understanding to speak from not that we
[14:52] believe that brother brandham was God no
[14:55] but we believe the message come forth
[14:58] the proph Propet had problems in dates
[15:02] and times and seasons and and statements
[15:05] and and 700 instead of 7,000 and all cuz
[15:09] he was a human
[15:10] being he said one time the black and
[15:12] white will die will fight again and die
[15:14] like flies well you could go around with
[15:17] it thus sayith the Lord go to the next
[15:19] message he said I made that statement
[15:22] under my own understanding see it was
[15:25] not of thus sayth the Lord but everybody
[15:27] wants to make everything brother Brown
[15:29] says it thus sayith the Lord you know
[15:31] and then we wind up he like I said we
[15:33] wind up saying well the Lord can't come
[15:34] now because they ain't no woman in the
[15:36] White
[15:38] House and ain't no pop come out of the
[15:40] United States
[15:42] yet well like I told you Wednesday if
[15:45] you took off the president the vice
[15:47] president and a couple of people and
[15:49] blowed them all out in one time you
[15:51] could have a woman as a president in two
[15:52] minutes right cuz that's about how long
[15:55] it takes them to when it's finished they
[15:58] just
[16:00] take her and she puts her hand on the
[16:01] Bible she's the president that's how
[16:03] quick it could happen Pope out of the
[16:05] United States one of them lik did 30
[16:07] days you remember that one Pope lasted
[16:11] 30
[16:12] days maybe something like that it might
[16:14] have been 90 days but I know it was a
[16:15] very short
[16:16] time and see that could happen in a
[16:18] hurry but my point is we're looking for
[16:22] something like
[16:24] that and those little things uh um you
[16:30] know instead of looking at the message
[16:34] the prophet brought unto us all right
[16:38] now all of those things will take place
[16:41] because of the
[16:43] message that we believe amen that's it
[16:46] all right time would last long enough
[16:48] they would definitely be a president
[16:51] would be a woman president they got one
[16:52] now this you know Hillary's coming up
[16:54] you know all of that and that's none of
[16:56] my business cuz I don't even vote anyway
[17:00] but you know time Li there'll be a poke
[17:02] coming out of the United
[17:04] States right but is that what we're
[17:07] waiting on or is that what we're going
[17:08] to do is just sit down and wait on the
[17:10] bus to pull up and then we crawl on the
[17:12] bus because here it is you
[17:17] know no I believe we need to get into
[17:20] the word that the prophet has brought
[17:22] unto us and by that realizing who we
[17:25] are
[17:27] right and see by doing that then we can
[17:32] see who we are and recognize who we are
[17:35] and what's taking
[17:37] place among us all right then I gave you
[17:40] a lot of quotes and I have these here to
[17:43] anyone that wasn't here Wednesday we
[17:45] have about 10 if you want a copy of
[17:47] these things that uh hold up your hand
[17:50] if you wouldn't here Wednesday to get a
[17:52] copy of them to where that the prophet
[17:55] would be explaining things to us and
[17:57] saying these things things that I will
[18:00] just paraphrase and quite you know just
[18:03] take a part out
[18:05] of the prophet of God said the bride
[18:08] would be the fullness of the godhead
[18:09] bodily but see we don't believe
[18:12] that but does that change what he
[18:19] said does that mean it's not right well
[18:22] now you just misread well uh I've done
[18:26] the best I could and even giving you the
[18:28] quotes to let you read it brother
[18:30] brandham said on the Good Shepherd of
[18:32] the sheep
[18:35] 1957 that he was the fullness of the
[18:37] godhead bodily all God was he poured
[18:38] into Christ all that Christ was God was
[18:41] in Christ and all that Christ is poured
[18:43] out on the
[18:45] church but you keep refusing
[18:49] it amen now that's the way he said it
[18:52] you keep refusing it right but yet how
[18:56] many quotes is there that all God was he
[18:58] put into Christ and all Christ poured
[19:00] into the church all
[19:02] right but he says on the message Be not
[19:07] Afraid e79 now these are on the internet
[19:11] to the people and anybody else out there
[19:14] that needs them call us we'll be glad to
[19:15] send them to
[19:17] you he says do you believe that he was
[19:20] the fullness of the godhead bodily all
[19:22] Jesus was he poured into the
[19:26] church he's the fullness of the god head
[19:28] bodily and all Jesus was he poured into
[19:30] the church the Holy Ghost is that so
[19:33] it's God in us God in you it doesn't
[19:36] make you anything it's not the Holy
[19:38] Mountain or the holy church it's the
[19:39] Holy Ghost amen all
[19:43] right
[19:45] now on the message Christ is the mystery
[19:47] of God reveal paragraph 160 God
[19:50] expressed in Jesus Christ who was both
[19:52] Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness
[19:54] of the godhead bodily now the complete
[19:56] fullness of the godhead bodily dwell was
[19:58] in his church the preeminent preeminence
[20:02] all that God was he poured into Christ
[20:04] and all that Christ was he poured into
[20:05] the church but brother Dale I just don't
[20:07] believe it because I don't see
[20:10] it you never will because with that
[20:12] statement you'll never see it forget it
[20:16] on that same message paragraph 380 and
[20:19] there would come a time come forth when
[20:22] he could express himself in fullness of
[20:26] his godhead deity through his church
[20:30] having the pinenes in the
[20:36] church the Mighty God unveiled paragraph
[20:39] 130
[20:40] 131 God in man God in Christ God in man
[20:43] fullness of godhead bodily in of man God
[20:45] in man now it's God in men the fullness
[20:48] of God and the godhead bodily in his
[20:50] entire church manifest in himself
[20:53] fulfilling his
[20:54] word all
[20:56] right then what was it
[20:59] then we went in to where that I started
[21:01] in 1969 in Athens Georgia speaking on
[21:04] this that the Bride of Jesus Christ in
[21:06] the end time would be the son of
[21:08] man brother brandom was not the son of
[21:11] man he was a son of man he said can't
[21:13] you get that straight he said it's not
[21:15] the he's the
[21:16] messenger he's not the God but yet all
[21:20] the bride together which would include
[21:21] brother brandom in the body of Christ
[21:23] would make it to fullness of the godhead
[21:25] bodily could be and in doing that it
[21:27] would be these on man God's only
[21:29] provided place of worship 65128
[21:32] paragraph 264 no leav among you that
[21:35] brings the entire fullness of the
[21:37] godhead bodily among you couldn't do it
[21:39] in Luther's day couldn't do it in Wesley
[21:40] couldn't do it in Pentecostal but in the
[21:42] day when the son of man will be
[21:44] manifested reveal brought back the
[21:46] church together with the entire deity of
[21:48] God amongst his people the prophet said
[21:51] he would become visible Among Us what is
[21:53] what the Holy Ghost given for become
[21:56] visible Among Us and raise the dead and
[21:58] we go in Rapture but he doesn't come
[22:00] visible as a physical he doesn't become
[22:02] literal physical compound or whatever
[22:04] you want to call it 16 elements until we
[22:07] meet him in the air and then we'll go to
[22:10] the uh Millennium and then he'll be
[22:12] their physical all
[22:15] right just giving you these then we get
[22:17] on to our
[22:19] point he said on the message the Mighty
[22:21] God unveiled before us paragraph 147 and
[22:25] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[22:26] be at the coming of the son of man did
[22:28] veiled in human flesh and remember Jesus
[22:31] didn't say when the Son of God has been
[22:33] revealed in Luke 17th chapter I believe
[22:35] it is about the 20th 21st verse
[22:37] somewhere along there he said and when
[22:39] the son of man is being revealed the son
[22:42] of man back in in in the church again

[22:49] Son of God but the son of man again back

[23:09] promised to do and so shall it be in the
[23:11] coming of the son of man as it was in
[23:13] the days of lot so shall it be God
[23:16] living in human flesh moving Among Us in
[23:20] the form of his church
[23:23] amen the form of his
[23:26] church okay but see everybody say said
[23:28] oh yeah we believe it brother R well
[23:29] amen we we believe that right God was
[23:33] made manifest in a human flesh right we
[23:36] believe that but he could not be the
[23:39] fullness of the godhead bodily but the
[23:42] bride around the world not just Lula
[23:48] Georgia I've never taught nothing like
[23:50] that but around the
[23:54] world something's got to happen to take
[23:56] us out of
[23:57] here right
[23:58] whatever you believe about it's got to
[24:00] be related to the bride sure as we would
[24:02] see Jesus 1964 paragraph 161 and if
[24:06] Jesus is in you tonight it's still God
[24:09] manifest himself in the last
[24:11] days the son of man revealing himself in
[24:14] his
[24:15] church the human flesh making himself
[24:19] known God down in his church down here
[24:23] in his church making himself again the
[24:25] word the son of man be revealed in the
[24:27] last days as it was in the days of Sodom
[24:30] message called a
[24:32] trial much more could we say as son of
[24:35] man making himself known among his
[24:37] people in the form of his people not Son
[24:41] of God not son of David but son of man
[24:44] amen the supernatural goes on down in
[24:47] that same message he says as the days of
[24:50] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[24:51] the Son of God coming now watch him when
[24:54] the son of man shall be revealed now you
[24:56] know he knows the scriptures in what
[24:58] he's bringing all right the son of man
[25:00] being revealed not the Son of God in the
[25:03] church he's put out of that now he's son
[25:06] of man revealing himself the word is
[25:08] becoming flesh Among Us the Harvest Time
[25:12] when the son of man this is paragraph
[25:15] 354 is being revealed not man the son of
[25:19] man not an organization the son of man
[25:21] the word living itself again among the
[25:26] people the word itself made flesh in you
[25:29] you are refle a reflection of this hour
[25:32] the message reflecting
[25:35] it so I just want to make sure that you
[25:38] seen what I was talking about to some of
[25:40] you that wasn't here Wednesday and then
[25:42] you hear me make a
[25:44] comment I made these comments 40
[25:47] something years
[25:48] ago and I surely believe it more today
[25:51] than I did then and I believe that God
[25:54] is waiting on you and I so the prophet
[25:57] says
[25:59] adoption time when God can pour in his
[26:02] fullness that's it and can raise the
[26:04] dead and we'll go into Rapture what the
[26:06] Holy Ghost given
[26:07] for all right waiting on you and I amen
[26:12] right amen well now in that when are we
[26:18] going to have and I want to get started
[26:20] now on the message I'm just doing that
[26:22] part to lay it over to where that people
[26:25] would hear what I said and they would
[26:27] not maybe get the
[26:29] quotes I think I read what the prophet
[26:32] said I believe I've tried to but see why
[26:36] can't we have a positive attitude then
[26:40] amen why are we so down at the mouth as
[26:42] brother forny likes to say wowy wowy
[26:46] woo
[26:48] you you just don't understand brother
[26:51] Dale my
[26:53] case oh my
[26:56] Lord you know you just don't understand
[26:59] my
[27:02] problems well what do you want the whole
[27:04] world to have your
[27:07] problems you know that's why most most
[27:10] crimes are solved is because people
[27:12] can't keep their mouth shut about the
[27:14] crime they done and they'll go out and
[27:16] tell somebody about it and then they go
[27:17] tell somebody
[27:20] else here while back we were loading a a
[27:23] refrigerator for brother Hank and I told
[27:26] him I said hey it's on my leg
[27:29] and uh they didn't know what had done my
[27:32] leg swell I didn't even tell me why my
[27:34] leg swell it's
[27:37] big I didn't even tell my
[27:39] wife my ankle turned black my toes
[27:42] turned
[27:43] black I didn't tell her why cuz she'd
[27:46] have been worried about it I knew it
[27:47] wouldn't
[27:48] broke it was just
[27:52] bruised right but you
[27:54] see we got to have somebody on our side
[27:58] down
[27:59] out I'm going to get into this I'm going
[28:02] to get into something and this message
[28:03] is going to run some of you off or do
[28:07] something because I'm going to be plain
[28:09] which I gener
[28:11] am and maybe blunt which I gen am but
[28:16] see I think it's time for us to have a
[28:19] positive
[28:21] attitude why not what age answer me
[28:24] please what age of
[28:27] time would you think of living
[28:29] in that the people of the message of
[28:33] that day you know and time should be any
[28:38] more positive than you and I
[28:42] am now you know I'm going to quote the
[28:44] prophet behind that don't
[28:46] you goz what did he
[28:49] say he said if there were in any age in
[28:52] time that he was asked to where that he
[28:56] would been able to live
[28:58] before the world ever
[29:01] begun he said it would be this
[29:05] day amen
[29:07] why would have been great to walk with
[29:10] the Lord
[29:11] Jesus but remember Peter was walking
[29:13] with him and lost his
[29:17] substance
[29:21] right it would have been great to been
[29:24] down through there on the day of
[29:25] Pentecost and all of those things and
[29:26] wonderful right but give me the day
[29:29] we're living no matter what we've got to
[29:32] endure no matter what we've got to put
[29:34] up with and the end time I want to be
[29:38] here because this is where it's all
[29:40] going to be
[29:42] finished this is where the scripture
[29:44] will be fulfilled that the end of all
[29:46] things has come upon
[29:50] us and I'm Heaven help you to think that
[29:52] I'm trying to if you get it in your mind
[29:54] I'll just take it out before we start to
[29:56] think that brother Dale is going to try
[29:58] to preach us and pump us
[30:00] up I wish I
[30:04] could I I wish I could do that and wish
[30:07] I had a peel that I could pass out you
[30:09] know to
[30:11] everybody and wish I had something that
[30:13] would make us all feel good and then
[30:15] we'd finally
[30:18] decide hey maybe we are Christians come
[30:21] we feel
[30:24] good but now how are you going to do
[30:26] that when the Bible says many are the
[30:28] afflictions of the righteous but the
[30:30] Lord lead us out of them
[30:32] all am yeah but we just don't see the
[30:35] signs and
[30:36] wonders why don't you go out there
[30:41] then I don't mind talking like that you
[30:45] go out amongst organized religion and
[30:47] you find per Church per case more signs
[30:50] and
[30:51] wonders you'll find then you will find
[30:54] in message churches right
[30:59] what are we going to do let's quit and
[31:00] go over
[31:05] there you see where are we at folks you
[31:08] know the disciples came to a place one
[31:10] time
[31:13] and Jesus
[31:14] said why don't you go to can remember
[31:18] the 70 had left
[31:21] him and in plain language brother R said
[31:23] he just said why don't you go
[31:26] too you know this is this is not a py
[31:28] pad or petting
[31:30] party you know I know how to get
[31:35] people I know how to get in your
[31:39] bfold I know how to get in your
[31:43] car I know how to get what you
[31:45] got but the day I use my gift to do
[31:49] those
[31:50] things it'll be the last day I
[31:56] live why because that's not to be
[31:59] done that's
[32:01] right we've had a message we've had a
[32:04] prophet thank God yes sir am but like I
[32:08] told you over and over Martin Luther it
[32:12] was not him protesting the Catholic
[32:13] church that they got worried
[32:15] about they just laughed him off when he
[32:19] began to do those things when he nailed
[32:21] his thesis on the door they SED at him
[32:24] another fanatic it'll fade away yes but
[32:28] when the people begin to even though
[32:31] they even burn the buildings down cuz
[32:34] they thought that's what Luther was
[32:35] telling them read your history he said
[32:38] hold it I didn't tell you that see they
[32:41] thought he meant get out of the church
[32:43] just burn it
[32:45] down but it's when the people become one
[32:47] with what Luther had said the Catholic
[32:50] Church got
[32:51] concerned amen the devil's not going to
[32:54] get concerned until you and I begin to
[32:56] say what amen
[32:58] was it what the prophet may I quote him
[33:00] he said when you can say I and my father
[33:04] are one and these other things he said
[33:07] the shock could pull
[33:10] away well if we're all so lydy sweet and
[33:13] honey Parts you know that we just all of
[33:15] us are going brother Dale don't be down
[33:18] and out about all I ain't down and out
[33:20] i' I've been this way for 40 something
[33:23] years I've been up ever since I come in
[33:25] this message I don't know about you you
[33:28] don't find me with a down day do you

[33:32] sorry you call me up I'm sick as a
[33:34] buzzard and what did I say how you doing
[33:38] wonderful right amen and it's not that I
[33:40] don't believe that you can't confess
[33:42] what you're
[33:44] got but see that's what we dwell
[33:47] on we were listening to a tape the other
[33:49] day and you'll see where I'm heading
[33:51] listening to a tape the other day day
[33:53] you know what brother R said he said we
[33:56] have too much information
[33:58] yes and I listen a minute think what he
[34:00] was saying CU I know what I've been
[34:03] thinking and he said we have too much
[34:06] information and I knew he was not saying
[34:08] we have too much word too much
[34:11] understanding of the Bible he was not
[34:13] talking to that it was the natural
[34:16] world you know the natural world was too
[34:18] much information and you know what you
[34:20] say here and I know you and some of you
[34:22] when I say this you're going to get
[34:23] upset go ahead but smile at
[34:26] me
[34:29] you can walk in here today and you can
[34:31] say I went to the
[34:33] doctor and I had a complete physical and
[34:36] they gave me a clean bill of
[34:40] health some of you will say yep and I
[34:43] read about three guys the other day that
[34:44] had a clean bell of help they died in
[34:46] three
[34:48] days that's
[34:53] unbelief that's unbelief at least let me
[34:57] know hinder
[35:03] you but but I'm just saying like the
[35:05] doctor say
[35:08] it
[35:09] yeah back years ago when they had the
[35:12] the dip theor is or went they had those
[35:15] diseases you know what was the problem a
[35:18] lot of the people that were so energetic
[35:20] and so wonderfully helping the people
[35:23] were the carriers of the
[35:25] disease because they wouldn't take the
[35:28] disease and they were carriers but they
[35:30] were passing it on and what are you
[35:32] going to say to
[35:34] them you know what they done with them
[35:36] they took them and locked them
[35:38] up because they were killing people but
[35:41] I was all the rest of the lazy Bunch
[35:43] sitting around wasn't doing nothing that
[35:45] person looked real good didn't
[35:47] they but they were killing people see
[35:50] our unbelief is what's killing
[35:55] us our unbelief
[35:58] is what's killing us it's destroying us
[36:03] we've got so much
[36:09] information show me where Peter would
[36:11] talk like
[36:16] that I thought we were supposed to have
[36:18] a positive
[36:23] attitude well I'm just being honest you
[36:27] an
[36:30] honest carrier of
[36:36] unbelief you say what I you suggest I do
[36:39] I suggest we shut our
[36:40] mouths when somebody tells us something
[36:43] we should be
[36:47] positive they say I'm sick we should be
[36:50] positive great the doctors can help
[36:54] you go to them we've never never been
[36:57] against doctors right blood of random
[37:00] sent people to H have
[37:03] operations
[37:05] right brother random was going to the
[37:07] doctor every day out in the 62 I believe
[37:10] it is series on Jehovah Gyra in
[37:13] California I believe that's right now
[37:15] but he was going to the doctor every day
[37:17] himself and out there praying for the
[37:19] sick the sick being healed and the dead
[37:20] being
[37:22] raised
[37:25] am but brother Dale I don't want to
[37:29] lie why you're a liar anyway
[37:35] yeah if you don't say by his stripes I'm
[37:39] Healed you are
[37:43] lying that's a lie because the Bible
[37:45] says you
[37:47] are does that do away with going to the
[37:49] doctor you know how it is you know what
[37:51] I've always said did my wife even get on
[37:53] to me I go down to the doctor's office
[37:55] and I'm sick as a buzzard and the doctor
[37:57] said how you doing I said I'm doing what
[37:58] great she said well they can't treat you

[38:25] good time with him
[38:28] you know they hunt for them glands see
[38:30] if it swelled up I know what he was
[38:32] doing I know what they t on you to see
[38:34] how you how you your insides are doing
[38:36] and everything he was just a pumping
[38:38] around on me like that looking at me GRE
[38:39] me him talk I said
[38:42] hey are you trying to find something are
[38:45] you just trying to make me think you
[38:47] know what you're
[38:49] doing he looked at me forget it well why
[38:56] not why can't we be he's a he's a human
[38:58] just like I
[39:01] am but church we got to have a positive
[39:04] attitude and a positive attitude is not
[39:07] I will not confess I'm
[39:10] sick now that's what people think's a
[39:12] positive
[39:13] attitude don't say you're sick cuz you
[39:16] will be sick don't say you got that or
[39:19] you'll have it you already got
[39:24] it say by strip I'm Healed
[39:33] I don't go around telling the world hey
[39:34] I got leukemia y'all pray for
[39:38] me I said they say I've got leukemia cuz
[39:42] they really can't prove
[39:44] it because it's supposed to be that
[39:47] white blood count it's supposed to be
[39:49] going up up up up and that doctor Le at
[39:54] Sam he said it's down about five points
[39:57] what it was the last time lord and he
[40:00] says it ain't something I'm giving
[40:03] you see make a confession be positive
[40:08] about it
[40:10] amen come on we're going to relate it
[40:12] this way when we get to
[40:13] it you believe in one true and living
[40:15] God
[40:20] right but I know where brother Brandon
[40:23] said let stand and address the third
[40:25] person of the trinity
[40:28] maybe he was a trinitarian and he
[40:30] finally told
[40:34] it you see what your
[40:37] information does for
[40:42] you when I look at those things I look
[40:44] at it in my life cuz he's a human being
[40:47] you know
[40:49] what according to the world Jesus is the
[40:52] third person of the Trinity so he's just
[40:54] saying what they're
[40:56] saying
[40:58] he's never taught nothing like
[41:00] that even when he was a Baptist he never
[41:02] taught nothing like
[41:04] that that's what he
[41:07] said come
[41:09] on but you see church we take the point
[41:12] that we think we have
[41:17] faith we think we have faith but as I
[41:20] saying could somebody come along and
[41:22] talk you out of the the the real true
[41:26] understanding of one true and living God
[41:29] now I'm going to make a bold statement
[41:31] if it's not a revelation they
[41:33] can
[41:35] right that's right you can quote brother
[41:38] random every day of your life and still
[41:40] not have a revelation
[41:42] amen
[41:44] amen oh brother Dale brother vam had the
[41:46] Revelation well great he had it but that
[41:49] don't mean you and I got it the Bible
[41:51] already said the things the prophet
[41:52] brought to
[41:55] us but we through our
[41:58] unbelief caught it incorrect that's
[42:02] right positive
[42:06] attitude positive about where we're at
[42:10] right we we we'll get to see job says I
[42:15] know and that's a man without the
[42:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[42:20] right the Holy Ghost has not been given
[42:22] cuz Jesus has not been glorified is that
[42:24] scripture
[42:26] John 11 or 17 or 7 or something I'll get
[42:29] to it the me I got it written in
[42:34] here but anybody in the Bible that ever
[42:37] amounted to anything had to have a
[42:39] positive attitude so that's my whole
[42:41] background to to study from
[42:44] see a positive
[42:47] attitude and see not to be
[42:51] negative no I mean wouldn't it be
[42:54] something for Anna to go to the kids at
[42:56] school and I kids want to teach you how
[42:57] to
[42:58] count but you never will get to be good
[43:01] at
[43:05] it well I ain't going to start
[43:09] counting
[43:11] right brother Gary his dad great doctor
[43:15] great friend of
[43:18] mine he said the first day they went to
[43:20] medical school said they told him said
[43:23] if you won't hinder your patience what
[43:25] was the percentage
[43:27] 50 or 80% or something like that of your
[43:30] people will get well if you don't hinder
[43:36] them that's that's pretty good ain't it
[43:39] you go into the doctor and the doctor
[43:40] you tell the doctor I'm hurting yep I
[43:42] had three guys this week hurting that
[43:43] when they all died so that means you
[43:45] going to
[43:49] die I said give me a money
[43:52] back at least I'll go enjoy it you if
[43:56] I'm going to die
[43:59] no that doctor told me he'd take my
[44:01] kneecap off it wasn't me speaking from
[44:04] here or nowhere but something inside of
[44:06] here says you will never take it
[44:09] off and I laughed at him I said forget
[44:12] it doctor you won't take my kneecap off
[44:15] he laughed and he said you will he said
[44:20] I can prove to you it's wor out I said
[44:22] so no problem I'm assume he's probably
[44:25] dead now because he's pretty good age
[44:28] but you see that's the
[44:29] point and I'm not going to be talking
[44:32] about a positive attitude other than one
[44:34] thing we will deal with that if you
[44:36] don't have a positive attitude there's
[44:38] no way for you to have a
[44:41] revelation so you see where that I'm
[44:43] basing it we are the ones that keeps the
[44:46] Revelation from
[44:49] coming you cannot be I will prove it by
[44:51] the prophet you cannot be healed you
[44:53] cannot be saved by mental Faith that's
[44:56] right
[44:57] but if you don't have mental Faith you
[45:00] can't be
[45:03] saved now you say well that's double
[45:05] talk no it's not it's truth
[45:10] right it's
[45:13] truth but see there's a difference
[45:16] between mental
[45:19] faith and a supernatural Revelation
[45:24] amen but you know what
[45:27] Brother Gary and I talking about this
[45:28] the other day going down to see Sister
[45:32] Mary if you've never
[45:34] experienced a real true Revelation you
[45:37] don't know what I'm talking
[45:40] about and yet you would stand in my face
[45:42] and deny it to the tee and say brother
[45:45] Dale I have
[45:50] faith if you've never been
[45:52] supernaturally even like just something
[45:54] like I said something come and it just
[45:56] tell you right there that's
[45:59] it and then you see it totally made
[46:01] manifest but don't make no difference
[46:02] when it
[46:04] comes you don't know what a supernatural
[46:07] Revelation is that's
[46:09] right if you've never experienced a new
[46:11] birth you can't tell nobody what it
[46:15] is amen I tell my own illustration that
[46:19] when I came into the message that I saw
[46:21] immediately I didn't have the baptism of
[46:23] the Holy Ghost the prophet was talking
[46:24] about the new birth I was a good old
[46:27] Baptist so I was talking to this Baptist
[46:29] preacher about the message and one day I
[46:33] told him he said well what's your
[46:35] confessions of things I said well I'm
[46:38] confessing one thing for certain I don't
[46:40] believe that I'm born
[46:45] again you know what he said to me most
[46:48] of you know right you know what he said
[46:50] he said well that why are you trying to
[46:51] teach me cuz I believe I've got it and
[46:54] you say and you don't have it then you
[46:56] can't teach me because you don't have
[47:04] it I said you got a point yes that's
[47:08] right but I said one day I'll have it
[47:10] and I'll come back and talk to you
[47:12] amen that's right cuz he was telling me
[47:15] the
[47:16] truth so one day I came to him I said I
[47:19] talk to you now he said oh you've had an
[47:20] experience I said yeah now we can
[47:25] talk did you see most people people
[47:27] think well I you come into the message
[47:28] that preacher told me one day well you
[47:31] you believe the message don't
[47:34] you and yet you say you're not born
[47:36] again I said
[47:37] well you can believe every scripture in
[47:39] the Bible to not be born again that's
[47:41] right you can be able to quote every
[47:43] scripture in the Bible and not be born
[47:44] again if you've never had a holy ghost
[47:47] Born Again experience you don't know
[47:49] what anybody's talking about that's told
[47:51] you they had
[47:55] one right that's right yeah but I've
[47:58] done this I've done that I've done this
[47:59] done and Satan can impersonate every one
[48:01] of them now what you going to
[48:03] do
[48:07] right I've seen Angels I've seen this I
[48:10] did too 11 years old so God standing in
[48:13] the church never counted at a new
[48:18] birth and even speak to me personal
[48:21] things down through my life they never
[48:23] counted after I saw brother brandom and
[48:25] so what are he talking about right that
[48:27] the new birth is a
[48:32] person well now listen now let me show
[48:34] you illustrate
[48:36] something the minute I said just then
[48:38] that the new birth is a
[48:41] person how many of you had in your mind
[48:43] well brother Dale explain what a person
[48:45] is are you talking about a real person
[48:48] are you talk and not you don't know what
[48:49] I'm talking about if you'd had the
[48:52] experience of the new birth you'd know
[48:54] what I'm talking
[48:55] about
[48:57] I wouldn't have to explain that I'm not
[48:59] talking about a physical God coming down
[49:01] and physically coming into
[49:05] me but I'm talking about justification
[49:09] sanctification and the baptism of the
[49:11] Holy Ghost that the people of this
[49:12] message has forgotten
[49:14] about right how many of them teach on it
[49:17] anymore oh you just believe the
[49:21] prophet will the devil beat
[49:24] you he believed in first
[49:29] right but you see Church what I'm trying
[49:31] to get to is a positive
[49:36] attitude and how to to look at it
[49:39] that there's a difference between a
[49:42] mental
[49:45] faith and a spiritual Revelation amen
[49:50] right but yet I read it I don't mean I
[49:52] done it every day now I didn't say that
[49:54] I ain't never said it but I have read
[49:56] six books brother brandham in one day
[49:58] and listen to two tapes that's a pretty
[50:00] good foundation to talk
[50:01] from but all that time I knew I wasn't
[50:04] born
[50:11] again that's a pretty
[50:14] good uh
[50:19] confession but remember it's not whether
[50:23] you accept
[50:24] him amen am I the message now the
[50:28] prophet said it's not whether you accept
[50:30] him or not he say where he said accept
[50:36] you right how come so many had followed
[50:40] the message for so long in the days that
[50:43] even on the takes you hear them say
[50:45] God's Prophet for this
[50:49] hour and yet where are there
[50:54] today right and them kind is not the
[50:56] ones that says he's wrong them the kind
[50:59] that just fell away years
[51:03] ago brother Charlie Cox told us about a
[51:06] certain brother BR that brother Brandon
[51:07] speaks of almost will never take he said
[51:10] in 6 months after brother brownon was
[51:12] gone they went back in the
[51:13] denominational
[51:15] church now that's his words my wife
[51:17] heard it so let forget it on tap he
[51:19] comes by denies it I'll say I still
[51:21] believe it that he said
[51:25] it
[51:27] but you see Church what is our
[51:31] confession that's why I said Wednesday
[51:33] night hard and strong how can you deny
[51:35] the word if you have the baptism of the
[51:37] Holy
[51:38] Ghost now you tell me anywhere you can
[51:41] right you mean the Holy Ghost in you
[51:43] will deny the
[51:46] word well you know I don't worry about
[51:48] running people
[51:49] off cuz if people leave they don't have
[51:51] the Holy Ghost Brother D amen right you
[51:56] shouldn't say it like
[51:59] that hey I'm the pastor I
[52:05] can't well I was just planning on
[52:06] leaving brother Dale but now you made me
[52:09] embarrassed embarrassed about
[52:12] what I'm just talking plain language to
[52:16] me but what about it now we read in the
[52:19] scripture as I said many people preached
[52:22] on Peter and his
[52:25] experience and we just just read in the
[52:27] scripture that a man one
[52:29] day looked out on the water thought it
[52:32] was a spook spoke to The Spook now I'm
[52:35] just putting our terminologies right
[52:38] thought it was an angel or
[52:40] something finally he said he got to
[52:43] recognizing him he said Lord if that be
[52:46] thee bid me
[52:49] come bid me to come out there where you
[52:51] at he said we just
[52:55] come well you know what I don't know how
[52:57] many was in the boat but nobody else
[53:00] jumped up and took
[53:05] off right so evidently nobody else in
[53:08] the boat had the Revelation who that was
[53:10] standing out there at least to what they
[53:11] were
[53:12] thinking why didn't everybody jump up
[53:14] and take off
[53:16] right no Peter just gets down and starts
[53:21] walking he had a substance under his
[53:23] feet right cuz you can't walk on water I
[53:25] don't care how big feet big your feet
[53:26] are you walk on snow with snow shoes but
[53:29] you can't walk on
[53:30] water you
[53:32] know all right but he looks around at
[53:38] circumstances and he begins to
[53:42] sink now I had this point to bring out
[53:44] but I'm going to just say it and forget
[53:45] it there's no mentioning there that he
[53:47] had to fall back in the water and start
[53:49] swimming I'm not even marking with you
[53:51] about that cuz that's what people want
[53:52] to do they want to find out if Peter
[53:54] fell back in the water and started
[53:56] trying to
[53:58] swim the Bible just said he was
[54:01] sinking well if he was sinking
[54:04] slowly then something was holding him
[54:11] up right God he should immediately have
[54:15] went back maybe he never lost everything
[54:18] at one
[54:20] time you
[54:22] know he just started
[54:25] sinking
[54:27] but
[54:30] now look what your Prophet had to say
[54:33] everybody knows this everybody knows the
[54:36] quotes but when are we going to get down
[54:38] to really listening and thinking about
[54:40] it the message perfect Faith go ahead
[54:43] and pull up number one
[54:46] brother and the prophet of God is
[54:49] illustrating
[54:51] this and he comes through Peter was
[54:53] doing all right and he was got scared
[54:54] and then he so little note where we can
[54:57] read Jesus said come he stepped down and
[55:00] said it's the Lord I'll just walk but
[55:03] when he got a eye his eyes on the waves
[55:05] he got
[55:06] scared what come in his
[55:10] mind first thing he I'm going to walk
[55:14] because the word said for me to walk
[55:17] that's the first thing and he started
[55:20] walking
[55:23] right and the next thing he he looked at
[55:26] his well he looked at his symptoms he
[55:30] looked out there and seen how big them
[55:32] waves was and he got scared and when he
[55:34] did down he went see what he feared
[55:39] happened what he believed that's
[55:42] happened when he believed he could walk
[55:45] he
[55:46] walked when he
[55:49] believed well he what when he believed
[55:52] got scared in his
[55:54] belief then his substance left
[55:58] him watch you see he still professed his
[56:04] faith but he didn't have the substance
[56:10] y are you
[56:13] read he thought he
[56:18] did he thought he
[56:22] did he did it
[56:25] first
[56:27] he was willing to Adventure right out
[56:30] like I said none of the others got it
[56:33] wi why the Lord told me to do it it's
[56:37] got to happen so he just steps right
[56:39] down out of the boat and he takes off he
[56:42] never thought about the the
[56:45] waves how contrary they was he never got
[56:48] that in his
[56:54] mind so he didn't lose his
[56:59] confession he lost his
[57:04] substance now that's Hebrews
[57:06] 111 isn't it yes where faith is the
[57:09] substance of things hope far the
[57:11] evidence of things not seen right we'll
[57:14] get to those
[57:15] later but remember Peter walked on the
[57:20] water as I said none of the rest tried
[57:24] it so evidently they was a little
[57:26] unbelief in them where they were just
[57:28] got down and went you said oh no he just
[57:29] called
[57:30] Peter well no the rest of them didn't
[57:32] say now fact that that be thee either
[57:35] you
[57:35] know you understand yes and then we want
[57:39] to make a lot of light but you know what
[57:40] Peter walked on the
[57:43] water you want to make a lot of light
[57:45] out of him how he slipped and fell and
[57:47] he done this and
[57:50] that uh how many of you ever walked on
[57:55] water
[57:56] no we're like the father Divine orever
[57:59] which one it was done at that time but
[58:00] I've told you many
[58:01] times he went down to the ocean he said
[58:04] this day I'm going to walk on the water
[58:05] and they rolled out this big carpet
[58:07] right down to the water and he goes
[58:09] strolling down through there and he gets
[58:10] right at the water and he stops he turns
[58:13] around and he comes back he said there's
[58:15] one unbeliever in the
[58:19] crowd I can't do
[58:22] it well you know which one I think was
[58:24] the unbeliever
[58:28] what about
[58:29] you I'm not making Lie To The
[58:34] Man I'm just telling you where we
[58:39] stand where we're
[58:41] at talking about us not
[58:44] him
[58:46] amen Peter was doing something that none
[58:48] of us had ever tried to
[58:55] do
[58:58] he took God as his word that's what we
[59:01] just read right said the word says
[59:08] it all right now if he had a
[59:12] substance and was able to walk on it and
[59:15] the prophet says he lost his substance
[59:17] but not his confession what did he
[59:23] have he had a mental faith
[59:28] right Peter had a mental
[59:34] Faith he had a substance faith when he
[59:37] could
[59:38] walk he lost the substance where's he
[59:42] at now come
[59:44] on don't throw him off and make him an
[59:46] unbeliever and die and going to hell
[59:48] because he done this that and the other
[59:50] I've heard it preached about him you
[59:54] know now he still had that is confession
[59:58] profession now what's the prophet mean
[1:00:00] by
[1:00:02] that simply what Peter
[1:00:06] said right what did Peter say Lord help
[1:00:13] me still confessing him to be almighty
[1:00:19] God still knowing that he was standing
[1:00:22] out there that's
[1:00:24] right and knowing that there was only
[1:00:27] one hope for him to get back
[1:00:30] there he had a pretty good
[1:00:34] confession so he said Lord help
[1:00:36] me well you know it's not written in
[1:00:38] there how Jesus had to struggle to grab
[1:00:40] him and hold him and pull him up or
[1:00:42] whatever to
[1:00:47] do I like what one brother used to
[1:00:50] Illustrated he said when it says there
[1:00:52] the word com said really what Peter was
[1:00:54] saying he was saying now Jesus you put
[1:00:57] under my feet what's under your feet and
[1:00:58] I'll walk out
[1:01:00] there that's a good point cuz that's
[1:01:02] what he
[1:01:04] done but what we fail to see is that
[1:01:07] Jesus just took his hand and put the
[1:01:10] substance right back under his
[1:01:14] feet or what do you think he done went
[1:01:17] out and grabbed him and struggled and
[1:01:18] picked him up and carried him back to
[1:01:20] the boat that's the way they'd make a
[1:01:22] movie out of
[1:01:24] it
[1:01:27] but he still had a good
[1:01:30] confession his confession
[1:01:32] was
[1:01:34] Lord there's no hopes outside of
[1:01:40] you you know the disciples finally one
[1:01:43] day come to the point till Jesus even
[1:01:45] said about him said do you now finally
[1:01:49] believe do you now finally
[1:01:54] believe
[1:01:57] but what about it we want to throw off
[1:01:58] on him and how his doubts and his
[1:02:00] frustrations and his
[1:02:07] thing but Jesus just took him by the
[1:02:09] hand and let him back into the
[1:02:11] boat he said oh you of little
[1:02:17] faith but get my point before we
[1:02:19] continue any
[1:02:22] further he never lost his confession or
[1:02:25] Prof
[1:02:29] he was standing there looking and saying
[1:02:32] God help
[1:02:33] me right put back under my feet sir the
[1:02:39] thing that I can't
[1:02:42] do bring it back to
[1:02:48] Meen amen he put it back under his feet
[1:02:50] and he walked back in the boat with
[1:02:52] him that was God doing it right
[1:02:56] amen just remember one
[1:02:59] thing it's not me and
[1:03:05] you all I read about the bride being the
[1:03:07] fullness of the godhead body the son of
[1:03:09] man the the visible among that has
[1:03:12] nothing to do with you and I other than
[1:03:14] we are the what do you call it we are
[1:03:15] the reciprocans we are the people that
[1:03:18] these things take place
[1:03:19] in we are the Peters that have lost our
[1:03:24] substance
[1:03:28] when brother randam said
[1:03:30] it this is the way I believe it I
[1:03:34] believe him to be just like all the
[1:03:36] other prophets that when they said it it
[1:03:38] was not them saying it it was God saying
[1:03:41] it that's right so when brother Brandon
[1:03:45] was speaking of how great the bride
[1:03:46] would be he's not just trying to build
[1:03:49] you up and make you feel
[1:03:53] good until a big brother I told you he
[1:03:55] said the message that the third pool is
[1:03:57] only for the Lord Jesus and brother
[1:04:00] random and brother random said the third
[1:04:02] pool is for the bride and the
[1:04:05] church and to the totally
[1:04:10] lost well I don't understand that does
[1:04:13] that make it
[1:04:15] unbelief no it's unbelief in you and I
[1:04:22] right when we say anything contrary to
[1:04:26] God's word
[1:04:28] amen by his stripes I'm Healed that's
[1:04:33] what he
[1:04:36] said for me to say anything else I'm a
[1:04:38] liar
[1:04:39] Amen brother want L about it cuz I got
[1:04:42] just bad feeling you'll keep that bad
[1:04:44] feeling too
[1:04:45] amen I got a little gland back here on
[1:04:49] each
[1:04:50] side one of them's been my buddy for 50
[1:04:54] years I guess
[1:04:56] they didn't even choose to take it off
[1:04:57] when they took the one off my neck
[1:04:59] talking about me having
[1:05:01] leukemia I call him a buddy cuz he's
[1:05:03] back there but every time I put my hand
[1:05:06] down like that and I do it
[1:05:08] constantly and I feel a little bitty
[1:05:10] fell over here and a big fell over here
[1:05:12] and I say by his stripes I am heal
[1:05:21] Hallelujah when you going to start doing
[1:05:24] that huh I'm H so bad by his stripes I
[1:05:29] am
[1:05:37] healed confess your way into
[1:05:40] it you know it might change from mental
[1:05:43] faith and become spiritual
[1:05:47] Revelation that's what I'm trying to get
[1:05:48] you to see amen sir yes amen what Peter
[1:05:53] had under his feet one minute he lost
[1:05:55] that that substance of his own self
[1:05:57] right but the god of Glory put it back
[1:06:00] under his feet and he walked into the
[1:06:02] boat that's right amen
[1:06:04] amen if not you're going to have to say
[1:06:06] he drugged him or toed him or done
[1:06:11] something and you're never going to be
[1:06:12] able to understand how the mental faith
[1:06:16] can become a spiritual
[1:06:21] Revelation you don't start with a
[1:06:23] spiritual Revelation oh God just pour
[1:06:25] that now I didn't hear nobody you liar
[1:06:28] you read the Bible you heard somebody
[1:06:30] say it mama said it I don't care who
[1:06:32] said you need to be saved
[1:06:35] amen I didn't hear nobody say I needed
[1:06:37] to be saved I just got saved one
[1:06:42] day may I stay in the
[1:06:47] scripture there's nobody in the Bible
[1:06:49] ever got the Holy
[1:06:50] Ghost I challenge you to come and show
[1:06:53] me nobody in the Bible ever got the Holy
[1:06:55] Ghost that didn't hear the word
[1:06:58] first come
[1:07:01] on CU I still believe Faith cometh by
[1:07:05] hearing and hearing by the word of the
[1:07:12] Lord amen
[1:07:15] amen but do you see what I'm talking
[1:07:19] about he didn't have his substance
[1:07:24] left but God took what he
[1:07:29] had and walked him back to the
[1:07:35] boat Lord put under our
[1:07:38] feet what's in our head that's right do
[1:07:42] you understand put it in my heart and
[1:07:45] it's going under my
[1:07:49] feet mental Faith then can become a
[1:07:53] spiritual
[1:07:54] revelation
[1:07:58] so meal mental Faith now is a very
[1:08:00] wonderful
[1:08:05] thing now mental faith is
[1:08:10] not a
[1:08:13] substance is that that's where we get
[1:08:15] tied up
[1:08:18] at we see it happen for somebody else we
[1:08:21] see it work in their lives
[1:08:24] yes and brother R said it ought to put
[1:08:27] us in desperation right to see somebody
[1:08:30] else get healed ought to put us in
[1:08:35] desperation now there's a little sister
[1:08:37] sitting back here
[1:08:40] it's in close to
[1:08:43] 90 she's done a little over 80
[1:08:47] anyway you know physically they tell her
[1:08:49] she was in perfect
[1:08:53] health you know what she eats right
[1:08:55] right she does right oh that's
[1:09:01] good but you know all of us can't be
[1:09:04] that because our bodies are made
[1:09:07] different we're you know but we know for
[1:09:10] certainty that we're deteriorating
[1:09:13] fast right the kids can't do like we do
[1:09:17] my kids can't even still work with me
[1:09:18] yet and I'm 704 years
[1:09:20] old they get tired and want to
[1:09:24] quit
[1:09:26] everybody thinks Hank can work he got
[1:09:28] down the house the other day we worked
[1:09:29] and he he had to go sit
[1:09:32] down all right see everybody a made that
[1:09:36] way the deterioration in the body you
[1:09:39] say what are you getting
[1:09:40] at I'm getting at one point I think we
[1:09:43] should do what
[1:09:45] we you know I don't eat I I eat pork and
[1:09:48] I don't misunder understand but I won't
[1:09:50] eat it for a long
[1:09:52] time because I got enough sense to know
[1:09:55] that pork cures problems with blood
[1:09:57] pressure yes but brother Dale if it's
[1:09:59] Sanctified by the word of God In Prayer
[1:10:02] now you can do all that you want to it
[1:10:03] just don't encourage me
[1:10:05] none if it really is there is no
[1:10:11] problem but common sense says don't eat
[1:10:16] too much
[1:10:19] pork well I know people that ate pork
[1:10:22] and died at
[1:10:24] 95
[1:10:26] y but not
[1:10:31] today sure it did we used to have old
[1:10:35] lard bucket lard that was rendered out
[1:10:38] over a
[1:10:41] fire and we made biscuits and cornbread
[1:10:44] and stuff out of
[1:10:47] it but we worked it out of the
[1:10:51] body we didn't sit down lazily and play
[1:10:55] on computers
[1:10:57] and I can't understand how did I keep
[1:11:00] gaining
[1:11:05] weight I used to be able to lose weight
[1:11:08] now you used to
[1:11:13] work come
[1:11:14] on right just talking about mental
[1:11:20] Faith but you see we think mental Faith
[1:11:23] a lot of times is a spiritual revelation
[1:11:29] right like brother Al said one time he
[1:11:32] said why don't you go upart brother Dale
[1:11:34] let him talk you out of what you think
[1:11:35] is Faith remember him making that
[1:11:38] statement many years ago let him go talk
[1:11:40] you out of it I can talk you out of it
[1:11:42] it's not
[1:11:44] Faith amen if you go into that doctor
[1:11:48] convinces you that doctor is right now
[1:11:51] physically he's
[1:11:53] right statement he's
[1:11:56] right but if he convinces you you're
[1:11:59] dying you know what go buy
[1:12:01] you great plot
[1:12:05] yeah and I've never been one to be that
[1:12:08] way I know a brother years ago he said I
[1:12:09] ain't buying no great plot go me want to
[1:12:11] die well you know what somebody had to
[1:12:13] buy one when he
[1:12:17] died what's any problem
[1:12:20] with come on but see you just think well
[1:12:24] no no
[1:12:25] I'm saying it this way same brother I
[1:12:29] ain't going to pay no
[1:12:33] taxes I ain't going to pay none of them
[1:12:36] social security stuff about two years
[1:12:38] before he got old enough to draw he
[1:12:40] started
[1:12:43] paying what are you calling that
[1:12:45] progressive
[1:12:48] revelation or
[1:12:51] what you know I get tickled it
[1:12:55] families when they say we don't believe
[1:12:57] in birth
[1:13:01] control they have about six kids and all
[1:13:03] at months they don't have no
[1:13:09] more
[1:13:11] right now something went wrong
[1:13:17] somewhere you see what I'm talking
[1:13:22] about we'll read it this afternoon with
[1:13:24] a Prophet said the biggest portion of
[1:13:26] our faith is mental
[1:13:29] Faith that's it but now don't let me
[1:13:32] hinder your mental
[1:13:36] faith I wouldn't dare go over here to
[1:13:38] this church right here beside of us and
[1:13:42] tell them they're all
[1:13:46] lost well run I tell you that's the way
[1:13:48] I believe they believe I believe you're
[1:13:49] lost I'm going tell you all I'm lost God
[1:13:52] told me to tell them that you show me
[1:13:54] brother random one time in any church
[1:13:56] that ever told them people in that
[1:13:58] church is
[1:14:02] lost come on that's reason I don't play
[1:14:05] games I want to know where he said
[1:14:08] it now he might tell an individual he
[1:14:10] might tells him listening to him the
[1:14:12] other day when he was talking about you
[1:14:15] know how the discernment would
[1:14:17] come you know that brother around him in
[1:14:19] his early Ministry was like Jack Cole he
[1:14:21] used to call him
[1:14:22] out but you know what he said one day
[1:14:26] he said God told me not to do
[1:14:28] that he said I had a wonderful
[1:14:31] preacher that had a big church that I
[1:14:34] called out something in his
[1:14:37] life and said it red a
[1:14:41] man he said I won't do it
[1:14:47] again which you see we think we're L of
[1:14:50] the
[1:14:53] Lord I've had people to tell me mean so
[1:14:55] I'm not going to take this medication no
[1:14:58] more I confess with
[1:15:01] you but the same time one certain
[1:15:03] brother I went over to another brother I
[1:15:05] said keep your eyes on him cuz he ain't
[1:15:08] going to take that medicine
[1:15:10] anymore you said that's unbelief no that
[1:15:12] was straight
[1:15:14] truth cuz your body chemically is going
[1:15:16] to
[1:15:18] react he came back and he said Brother D
[1:15:21] I messed up I should you're right don't
[1:15:22] do it again till the doctor tells you
[1:15:25] right that's why I tell you go to the
[1:15:29] doctor but when the doctor tells you you
[1:15:31] don't need that you quit it but I ain't
[1:15:34] no
[1:15:35] faith I get sick of people and their
[1:15:40] faith when you know for short they don't
[1:15:43] have
[1:15:47] it see some of you think that if I pray
[1:15:50] for it immediately healed I had Faith
[1:15:52] we're going to get in brother random
[1:15:53] where you can make go for a long long
[1:15:55] time before it is made
[1:15:59] manifest and then you're going to get
[1:16:00] upset when I read brother brandom where
[1:16:02] he said he loves to test
[1:16:07] you God loves to test you how can he
[1:16:10] test you if you ain't sick my
[1:16:17] Lord but then we go as I said you know
[1:16:20] my Point's always being you go to the
[1:16:22] doctor doctor says you got cancer I
[1:16:25] don't have cancer blessed God I'm
[1:16:28] Healed you go about 6 or 8 months you
[1:16:30] start getting
[1:16:33] worse and you can see the person just
[1:16:36] H their faith is
[1:16:39] dwindling and then after a while they'll
[1:16:42] say maybe the Lord let me have cancer
[1:16:45] where they can use my case to find a
[1:16:47] cure for cancer oh boy you got a
[1:16:50] supernatural good Revelation ain't you
[1:16:51] oh you're really oh you're really so
[1:16:53] wonderful you're like the lady I was
[1:16:55] talking about or the thing where they
[1:16:57] was in there taking care of everybody
[1:16:58] but they were the one giving them
[1:17:04] diseases but you see church we talk
[1:17:06] about
[1:17:09] faith faith is a
[1:17:13] substance
[1:17:15] right it's not just I
[1:17:17] think if you've never had it you don't
[1:17:19] know what I'm talking
[1:17:22] about if you've never been healed by the
[1:17:25] word of God that you know you was healed
[1:17:27] when you took it you don't know what I'm
[1:17:28] talking
[1:17:30] about don't let me hinder your mental
[1:17:35] Faith go confess it
[1:17:38] sir walked into the doctor's office come
[1:17:40] right here my blood pressure was running
[1:17:44] 160 70 over 100 110 J Motors kept up

[1:17:52] went to the doctor we came here to the
[1:17:54] church and and we prayed and I said God

[1:17:58] I believe went to the doctor's office
[1:18:00] and run it up it 120 over 80 I said
[1:18:03] nurse would you believe that my blood
[1:18:04] pressure here's the paperwork to prove
[1:18:06] what it's been you believe God healed me
[1:18:08] she said no I walked in the doctor's
[1:18:11] office and he went through all of his
[1:18:12] routine said Sam your blood pressure is
[1:18:14] wonderful I said would you believe this
[1:18:16] report here they said my blood pressure
[1:18:18] has been running real high and God heal
[1:18:20] me he says
[1:18:22] no I got up and walked out of that there
[1:18:25] I said if you want me I told my wife you
[1:18:26] want me to go to the doctor you going to
[1:18:28] get me a Believer cuz I ain't going to
[1:18:29] him that's right amen walked in there
[1:18:32] one day when my eyesight was so till I
[1:18:36] just I just seeing waves like
[1:18:40] that I walked in there got
[1:18:45] glasses wor them for a long
[1:18:48] time walked in there again and it got
[1:18:50] getting
[1:18:51] worse than what it was even with the
[1:18:54] glasses I supposed to have been wearing
[1:18:56] and I walk
[1:18:57] in the doctor run his test and he looked
[1:18:59] at me and he said what are you doing
[1:19:00] with
[1:19:02] glces I said I've been wearing them for
[1:19:04] eight
[1:19:05] years why he said you don't need
[1:19:08] them I said what do you mean he said you
[1:19:10] got 120 I mean what do you call it 100
[1:19:13] over 2020
[1:19:16] okay I walked outside you know I went in
[1:19:18] there doing this way I walked outside
[1:19:21] and I
[1:19:23] looked it's kind of like what Richard
[1:19:26] said Richard the son-in-law he was in
[1:19:29] school and they got him for copying the
[1:19:31] papers of the people around him you know
[1:19:34] why cuz he couldn't read the
[1:19:36] board he couldn't see the board so he's
[1:19:39] coping well they took him in the office
[1:19:42] why are you copying I can't see the
[1:19:44] board they got him to go get GES he
[1:19:47] didn't know trees had
[1:19:52] leaves he just saw a glob
[1:19:56] he didn't know trees had leaves separate
[1:19:58] things
[1:19:59] on that's what I mean if God ever speaks
[1:20:01] to you you won't worry about nothing
[1:20:03] come on Brothers you won't worry about a
[1:20:05] thing you'll simply settle down and say
[1:20:08] my St I'm
[1:20:10] Healed don't ride on my Tombstone that I
[1:20:14] died of this that or the
[1:20:17] other that's right it's
[1:20:20] Faith but don't lose your mental faith
[1:20:26] yeah just because this message is not
[1:20:29] brother Brand's all the whole message is
[1:20:31] not I don't claim it's been revealed to
[1:20:32] me I don't claim this Bible that's been
[1:20:34] revealed to
[1:20:36] me but just because it's not revealed
[1:20:38] I'm not going to say it's not
[1:20:41] there I'm going to ask God to reveal
[1:20:44] it I've prayed about things for 20 years
[1:20:48] before I would ever preach one
[1:20:51] sermon on what I was talking
[1:20:53] about 20 years I studied that before I
[1:20:58] would ever preach
[1:20:59] it but then when I preach it I preach it
[1:21:03] as it and I said the other day this is
[1:21:08] that if this ain't that let me keep this
[1:21:10] till that gets here but let me keep
[1:21:12] quoting brother rown said this is that
[1:21:16] amen see I believe it what about you let
[1:21:20] stand what we got
[1:21:22] 372 mental faith can lead to a spiritual

[1:27:55] folks to just say something with our
[1:27:58] mouths is good because we need to keep
[1:28:01] saying
[1:28:02] it but it's got to come down to where
[1:28:04] there's something inside of us speaks
[1:28:07] back when he speaks back then it'll be
[1:28:12] settled you can't be saved by mental
[1:28:14] Faith you can't be healed by mental
[1:28:17] Faith but yet you don't want to stop
[1:28:19] believing that's
[1:28:21] right I just want to pray till it comes
[1:28:24] right well you don't have much Faith cuz
[1:28:27] you lay your hand back there and
[1:28:32] say am I not in the scripture that I'm
[1:28:35] supposed to
[1:28:37] confess yeah but you really well I admit
[1:28:40] I don't have it or it wouldn't be
[1:28:42] there but I'm going to confess my way
[1:28:45] into it and all the time I'm going to
[1:28:47] take his
[1:28:50] word and then one day that'll be gone
[1:28:52] and then what are you going to do
[1:28:54] well I was just a mental mental Faith
[1:28:56] won't heal
[1:28:58] you but some of you may not be back to
[1:29:00] seing it but just remember how close
[1:29:01] mental faith can
[1:29:04] be do you know that mental faith can be
[1:29:07] so
[1:29:08] close that a human
[1:29:11] being can focus on a
[1:29:15] glass and believe in that glass will
[1:29:20] break that's not Hocus Pocus that's
[1:29:23] right
[1:29:25] pretty good mental faith is it amen what
[1:29:28] about the prophet where the little girl
[1:29:30] he told her he said can you make that
[1:29:32] bracelet swing around and around in the
[1:29:33] room and stop he said I wanted to let
[1:29:36] you know you don't have faith she said
[1:29:39] that's you know that's wrong he said I
[1:29:42] knew you'd say that cuz you don't have
[1:29:44] faith but he said fastening My Eyes Upon
[1:29:48] that
[1:29:51] bracelet he said it begin to move
[1:29:56] but he puts it together with the
[1:29:57] breaking of the GL and he
[1:29:59] says a cheap magician can do it was he
[1:30:03] using a cheap magician's
[1:30:07] trick in the basis of what he was
[1:30:10] doing but he was using it to help her
[1:30:14] faith mental faith is very strong could
[1:30:17] we have it just to that way to put our
[1:30:18] whole lives on
[1:30:19] it Peter was willing to put everything
[1:30:22] he had on whether or not that man out
[1:30:23] there could get him and put him back in
[1:30:24] the
[1:30:26] boat what about
[1:30:29] it mental faith is a strong thing we're
[1:30:33] going to realize one of these days that
[1:30:35] the biggest portion of the world is
[1:30:36] mental
[1:30:37] Faith but now you tell me those people
[1:30:39] right over there you call them mental
[1:30:41] Faith but you tell me that church right
[1:30:43] over
[1:30:44] there if somebody comes in there and
[1:30:46] gets healed who heals
[1:30:48] them there's no healer outside of
[1:30:52] God Don't Make of
[1:30:54] nobody just
[1:30:57] remember they may be
[1:30:59] making doing something you and I can't
[1:31:03] do you say them people that walks on the
[1:31:05] colds of fire I ain't stupid I ain't
[1:31:07] going to do that I agree with you ain't
[1:31:09] either but I'm not going to make fun of
[1:31:11] him doing
[1:31:13] it cuz you know what he got something I
[1:31:16] ain't
[1:31:21] got who takes care of him
[1:31:26] now remember the devil can't take care
[1:31:29] of you right so don't say the devil took
[1:31:33] care of
[1:31:34] him uh-uh the prophet says God knows
[1:31:40] their
[1:31:44] faith see we want to blame it on
[1:31:46] everything else instead of just being
[1:31:50] straight and Lord what have I got mental
[1:31:56] Faith or a spiritual
[1:32:03] Revelation yeah but if I admit I just
[1:32:05] got a mental faith I'm saying I'm lost
[1:32:07] I'd he'd rather say I'm lost and find
[1:32:10] out how to get saved then for me to go
[1:32:13] in my own concept and never admit I was
[1:32:16] lost cuz if you never admit you lost you
[1:32:18] can't be helped
[1:32:21] amen yeah when I followed this message
[1:32:23] from for 40 years
