[26:35] good hand
[26:39] s
[26:41] good to see everybody in the house of
[26:43] the Lord if you like turning your
[26:45] scriptures turn to Matthew 24
[26:49] and Revelations 8
[26:52] Matthew 24 Revelations 8
[26:56] remember the Bible study will be the
[26:59] first Saturday in June
[27:01] all right I had that one wrote
[27:06] I should remember that
[27:08] and uh
[27:11] remember now the announcements is
[27:13] downstairs to all of the brothers that
[27:15] wanting to go to the uh
[27:19] Father's Day fishing trip you don't have
[27:21] to be that it's just all the brothers
[27:23] are invited to come you know and go with
[27:26] us it has a list of things to make sure
[27:29] you bring you know and all and to be
[27:32] downstairs and things that you are going
[27:35] to do and like need some volunteering
[27:39] around the camp you know to do different
[27:41] things so you read that there's one
[27:44] thing that should have been circled real
[27:46] good
[27:47] it says to make sure and bring earplugs
[27:51] because some of the brothers
[27:54] in the big tent yeah
[27:56] yeah you can't tell the difference of
[27:58] whether the buyers in the woods is
[28:00] making the racket or
[28:02] and I really think that that's why they
[28:04] don't bother us too much because the
[28:07] snoring is so loud until the little
[28:11] bears are afraid of the
[28:13] what they think is the Big Bear but
[28:15] it'll be downstairs it's there and just
[28:17] write that down or get it and read it
[28:19] and see what it's doing but now let's
[28:23] see if we can get through today and then
[28:25] we'll have some comments and questions
[28:27] if not we'll continue on into Wednesday
[28:30] night
[28:31] but I want you to to see this
[28:35] and to
[28:37] see what I'm saying it's like I've
[28:39] always said I've never asked anybody to
[28:42] believe
[28:44] what I've said
[28:46] I ask you to pray about it
[28:49] seek the Lord about it
[28:51] and let the Lord speak to you
[28:53] because I can't reveal it to you anyway
[28:56] I can only do as the prophet said stir
[29:00] up the part of you to where that the
[29:03] Holy Spirit then can speak to you and to
[29:07] reveal his word to you so let's pray
[29:10] Lord Jesus we thank you for all things
[29:13] we ask you now just guide us be with us
[29:16] as we Endeavor to speak about you Lord
[29:18] we ask you to come on the scene and
[29:20] manifest yourself
[29:22] through the opening of your word and
[29:24] that's not a problem to ask because you
[29:26] promised it and Lord we believe you and
[29:29] we thank you and we just ask you to have
[29:31] your way with us and let your love Lord
[29:34] be with each and every one of us
[29:37] touch the sick because you promised it
[29:39] and Lord those that are not here today
[29:41] the sicknesses and things we ask you to
[29:44] take it away and father just bless each
[29:47] one have your way we love you and we
[29:49] thank you in Jesus name
[29:52] amen
[29:53] Matthew 24.
[29:58] very familiar Parts with each one of us
[30:01] in Jesus went out and departed from the
[30:05] temple
[30:06] and his disciples came to him to show
[30:09] him the buildings of the Temple
[30:12] and Jesus said unto them see you know
[30:14] all these things
[30:16] verily I say unto you there shall not be
[30:19] left here one stone upon another that
[30:22] shall not be thrown down
[30:25] and as you set up on the Mount of Olives
[30:27] the disciples came into him privately
[30:29] saying
[30:30] tell us when shall these things be
[30:34] not one stone left on another right and
[30:37] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[30:41] and of the end of the world
[30:43] all right let's go over to Revelations 8
[30:45] 1. and just read that
[30:48] one part there and when he had opened
[30:51] the seventh seal there was silence in
[30:54] heaven about the space of half an hour
[30:57] you may be seated Lord had his Blessing
[31:00] to
[31:01] the reading of the word
[31:04] now not much of a background but always
[31:06] try to background the previous message
[31:10] and then try to continue on
[31:14] so we are talking about the coming of
[31:17] the Lord
[31:18] in talking about the coming of the Lord
[31:21] in the bases that's related to The Bride
[31:24] of Jesus Christ
[31:26] we are not talking about to coming to
[31:28] Israel
[31:30] we're not talking about an ending of the
[31:32] world Etc but we're talking about the
[31:36] coming of the Lord to the bride and the
[31:40] prophet said that he came he comes three
[31:42] times or three advents
[31:45] he said first one was he came to redeem
[31:49] his bride
[31:50] we know that has already transpired
[31:53] he comes the next time to catch his
[31:55] bride away
[31:57] that is the part that we are in now and
[32:00] then the third part is he we will come
[32:04] back with him in the millennial reign
[32:07] so then we're not to be concerned with
[32:09] the first part it's already finished
[32:12] the life's part that is coming there's
[32:15] no need to worry about it
[32:17] but as I said this morning those things
[32:20] are points of tantalizing thoughts that
[32:24] we wonder what's going on will it be
[32:26] babies born in the Millennium will it be
[32:29] this will it be that what good would it
[32:32] do if we knew that
[32:36] would it satisfy your ego
[32:40] you know
[32:42] I mean are we going to still have an ego
[32:44] when we get over I told you
[32:48] you just didn't listen to me I don't
[32:51] think that's going to be the situation
[32:53] you may but I don't think so
[32:57] I think it'll be a joyous time and we're
[32:59] going to be worried about it all right
[33:02] but now
[33:04] then we're not to be concerned with
[33:07] any other thing than the hour that we're
[33:09] living
[33:10] and I've tried my best for 40 something
[33:12] years to get you to see the day that
[33:16] we're living
[33:17] it's been my whole goal not to worry
[33:20] about that not to worry about the future
[33:22] but worry about what is right here now
[33:24] because it is the only part that will do
[33:28] us any good at this time
[33:32] you know is to talk about where we are
[33:35] now
[33:36] we have been into the thing the word
[33:39] that we understand
[33:41] that God sent a prophet
[33:44] he brought a message unto us we believe
[33:47] that was the Lord descending from heaven
[33:49] with a shout
[33:51] all right we believe that we're not
[33:53] looking for
[33:55] another Prophet to come
[33:58] to straighten this Prophet out
[34:01] or any other individual to straighten
[34:04] him out
[34:05] because you know that's your problem if
[34:08] you think you can
[34:09] you just better keep on
[34:12] going on down the road it could be very
[34:14] dangerous people don't realize what
[34:16] they're playing with
[34:18] they're playing with the very word of
[34:20] God
[34:21] in in a greater respect than even the
[34:24] the time of the Lord Jesus because he
[34:28] said if you say one word against the son
[34:30] of man
[34:31] it can be forgiven you
[34:33] all right but he said when he the Holy
[34:36] Ghost has come
[34:39] see one word will not be forgiven in
[34:41] this world or the world to come so then
[34:44] we better be careful how we approach
[34:47] things and what we do all right
[34:52] so the hour that you and I are living
[34:56] the time we're here
[34:58] and I keep expressing it because that's
[35:00] what I want
[35:03] the Catholic Church never got upset
[35:05] about Luther
[35:07] when he nailed his thesis to the door
[35:12] that didn't upset them
[35:14] but when the people begin to believe
[35:18] what Luther said
[35:20] they were losing a lot of Converse
[35:24] and they become very upset
[35:27] so they went after the uh one who
[35:31] brought the message
[35:33] a lot if you can't see that's where
[35:34] we're at now
[35:36] that you know
[35:38] right as I was saying this morning
[35:41] then here is the prophet's message
[35:44] that wasn't arguing much while he was
[35:45] here
[35:47] a few things in doctrinal issues come
[35:49] along after he was here
[35:53] but the main thing is right now that
[35:55] they're trying their best to destroy the
[35:57] credibility
[35:58] of the messenger and if they can do that
[36:02] they can destroy the credibility of the
[36:06] message in the minds of the people
[36:09] and you can say it doesn't bother me
[36:12] what they say
[36:14] well I'm honest to tell you it does
[36:17] bother me
[36:19] maybe not in the point of getting caught
[36:22] with their Doctrine but it bothers me
[36:25] because I know what it will do to the
[36:28] people
[36:29] it has destroyed the credibility of the
[36:33] message and really you don't understand
[36:35] what that means because if you can
[36:38] destroy the credibility of the message
[36:40] or what big words you want to use to put
[36:42] in there you know I'm not too good on
[36:44] there that but if you can destroy the
[36:46] credibility of this message then you
[36:49] have automatically
[36:52] destroyed the credibility of your Bible
[36:57] no I believe the Bible I just don't
[36:59] believe right around him probably
[37:00] now see
[37:04] there's no way to separate it
[37:10] see you and I don't realize what we've
[37:12] had
[37:15] no age has ever had even in the days of
[37:17] the Apostles
[37:19] even with a great ability Paul in the
[37:21] doings
[37:22] get on there a minute
[37:24] writing of Paul was probably all that
[37:27] was captured
[37:28] you know
[37:30] and looking this time
[37:33] then we can not only
[37:35] here
[37:36] the voice of the seventh angel
[37:40] we can do it see some of these are smart
[37:42] enough to do it I'm just barely catching
[37:45] home everybody laughs at my
[37:48] cut and tight
[37:53] and Joe dims got it back there if they
[37:55] want to stick it out here we can see it
[37:58] I cut out a quote not I give you the
[38:01] whole quote but then I cut it out
[38:03] instead of trying to use the computer
[38:05] because I ain't that smart
[38:08] but
[38:10] I still get the message across from what
[38:12] I want and give you the whole quote all
[38:14] right would you think about what you and
[38:16] I have had
[38:18] we have the ability
[38:20] to uh
[38:22] forgive me for a lack of words question
[38:25] the prophet asked to uh
[38:28] well I mean by that is say brother
[38:31] random what is a new birth
[38:34] didn't even go to Christ the mystery God
[38:36] reveal and that's what he said he said
[38:38] what is the new birth
[38:40] he said it's a revelation Jesus Christ
[38:42] personally to you well there's your
[38:45] answer
[38:47] well I'd sure like to ask him about that
[38:51] what would he say
[38:55] you remember how I was illustrating it
[38:57] Paul wrote penned it wrote himself shall
[39:00] descend from heaven with a shout for
[39:02] some Archangel trumpet I believe Paul
[39:04] saw that
[39:05] go to prophets these things
[39:08] and if you'd walked up to Paul and said
[39:10] Paul
[39:13] what did you mean
[39:17] he said what do you mean what did I mean
[39:19] I said what I meant
[39:23] see we had it interpreted the big Shout
[39:26] Dark Angel the trumpet
[39:29] that wasn't what Paul said
[39:34] you know what Paul said you remember
[39:36] what I was ran Paul said what brought
[39:38] around said in Christ in the future
[39:40] write your message when he said
[39:43] Jesus does all three of these in his
[39:46] descending
[39:47] that was what Paul said amen
[39:50] amen yeah we took 2 000 years to try to
[39:53] figure that out
[39:55] instead of believing we'll say it
[39:58] We can question the prophet not as a
[40:01] question
[40:03] would ask him for the answer
[40:06] and and you can pretty well get your
[40:08] answer all right
[40:11] I know
[40:13] what everybody then says well that's
[40:16] your way of looking at it your way of
[40:18] looking at it
[40:19] well
[40:21] if I can say what he said then I don't
[40:23] have to worry about the rest of it
[40:25] and I don't have to back off
[40:27] to say I believe this amount but I don't
[40:31] believe disallowed
[40:33] I believe what he said
[40:35] and I try my best to stay with that all
[40:37] right
[40:39] now
[40:41] then let's let the prophet
[40:44] try to explain
[40:48] were you and I are at right now
[40:52] because we're not in the future we're
[40:55] not in the past we're here now
[40:58] and I think it's about time to wake up
[41:01] and begin to
[41:03] believe
[41:04] what has been said instead of running
[41:07] around horrib we've had about 40
[41:09] something years
[41:10] to run around horrible
[41:13] you know
[41:15] and uh
[41:16] you know trying to I reckon make an
[41:19] impression or something but what have we
[41:21] done we run around horrible what are we
[41:23] doing we got tired
[41:25] that's about the best thing you can say
[41:28] because what's people doing now going
[41:30] out of the message
[41:32] me what did Brother Brown say to the two
[41:35] great things to God was his hindrance
[41:39] sight
[41:40] time
[41:43] that's the two greatest hindrance God
[41:45] has because of sight and time
[41:48] first everybody wants to see it second
[41:52] well
[41:55] maybe that's a coming
[42:01] well see then that's our problem
[42:03] then we can't take Hebrews 13 8.
[42:07] and stay with it being the same
[42:08] yesterday today and forever
[42:13] now this morning we were talking about
[42:15] it and
[42:19] I said I was laying down a way to come
[42:21] to this evening about the
[42:23] coming of the Lord to you and I
[42:26] I believe the coming of the Lord to the
[42:29] bride
[42:30] is the revealing of God's word
[42:33] because it's not a physical
[42:36] thing
[42:37] we meet him in the air
[42:40] so it would have to be then him
[42:43] descending by way of the prophet
[42:47] to bring us the message
[42:49] to speak unto us and be the voice
[42:52] you know
[42:54] and then when it would be that then we
[42:57] can just depend upon what he's saying
[43:00] all right
[43:01] I believe you and I have heard the shout
[43:05] the prophet's message
[43:07] I believe the voice of the Archangel
[43:11] which would be
[43:12] the Lord Jesus Christ that brought
[43:14] around and said
[43:15] he that same voice would raise the Dead
[43:19] I believe he will be here in the bride
[43:26] so much until she will be the fullness
[43:28] of the godhead bodily until she will be
[43:31] the son of man
[43:33] the word made flesh
[43:36] well I sure don't see it
[43:39] you wouldn't have seen it back there
[43:46] how would you
[43:49] even when people now quote wrote around
[43:51] him he said more in one service
[43:57] in his ministry
[43:59] than is written in the Bible
[44:03] one service
[44:05] more things took place now you take the
[44:08] entire Bible of the New Testament part
[44:10] writings and you take all of the
[44:13] accounts of over the period of time
[44:16] and how long it took and you put down
[44:19] and they wouldn't be a miracle done but
[44:21] about once every two weeks
[44:24] or maybe more
[44:26] if you took time put it with it
[44:29] run
[44:30] we look at it as like something
[44:32] happening every day and I believe it did
[44:34] but I'm just expressing it
[44:37] that's why I'm running around could say
[44:38] more in one service
[44:43] than in Jesus the entire Ministry
[44:45] written
[44:47] well they didn't believe him
[44:49] they didn't believe the prophet he did
[44:52] that ain't got nothing to do with me and
[44:53] you
[44:56] so what is now the coming of the Lord
[45:00] to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[45:04] through Jesus does all three the shout
[45:07] the voice of an archangel and the
[45:08] trumpet
[45:11] and we went through that here a while
[45:13] back and earlier a few Services ago
[45:16] and showing it
[45:18] the brother random says in the ten
[45:20] virgins
[45:24] 1960.
[45:27] he's talking about the hinder those that
[45:30] are asleep
[45:31] for the trumpet will sound
[45:33] something will take place
[45:36] the gospel trumpet
[45:42] and we owned paragraph 141.
[45:46] the gospel trumpet
[45:49] will sound
[45:51] the announcing of his coming
[45:55] right you remember the quote I gave you
[45:57] one day
[45:59] where brought around and said
[46:01] we will never be gathered together until
[46:04] the resurrection
[46:09] see we think we're going to get together
[46:12] he said we'll never be gathered until
[46:15] the resurrection
[46:17] because that's even sensible because
[46:19] we're still here scattered all over
[46:23] but the announcing of his coming the
[46:26] gospel trumpet
[46:30] my brother Dan I talked to trumpet would
[46:31] call us up
[46:33] we can't be called up until the
[46:35] Resurrection comes that's sensible that
[46:38] doesn't need a great big light bulb
[46:41] turned on doesn't it
[46:43] all right what's the next order
[46:45] Resurrection
[46:47] but we've done heard the message
[46:52] right
[46:55] I believe in this message is the shout
[46:58] the voice of the archangel and the
[47:01] trumpet
[47:04] if you're not going to be called
[47:06] together it's this message
[47:08] it's going to call us together
[47:10] you know but I'm still expecting it yeah
[47:14] that's that ain't gonna change you
[47:17] like I told you
[47:19] there used to be a time when people
[47:21] would run and jump about things but
[47:25] and I was reluctant to even mention the
[47:27] dead being raised because I didn't want
[47:30] the building filled up
[47:31] they may not have to buy another get
[47:33] another building
[47:36] see now you can talk about how you want
[47:38] to
[47:38] it don't increase at all
[47:41] see they don't believe it
[47:45] right
[47:47] I don't believe it
[47:49] you mean it could be a case that you and
[47:51] I could come they would be setting and
[47:53] abused but still not believe
[47:55] remember this morning
[47:59] that the prophet said what
[48:02] Rapture would take place
[48:05] people will go right on
[48:07] thinking they're getting the Holy Ghost
[48:11] I told you 40 something years ago what I
[48:15] believed what happened
[48:17] I'm as serious as can be about it I
[48:20] believe there will be a great smooth a
[48:22] great sweep of the Holy Spirit
[48:27] through the land
[48:28] right at the time
[48:30] but you know what
[48:33] as it sweeps among the bride it will
[48:35] also sweep among the world
[48:38] because the third pool is for the bride
[48:40] to the church
[48:43] for the bride and the church into the
[48:44] totally lost
[48:46] I believe there'll be a great moving
[48:48] Revival
[48:50] I've always believed that
[48:55] but you see I can also then turn around
[48:58] and say like
[49:00] brother is it Boaz
[49:03] um Jose
[49:04] that said brother random said the Lord
[49:07] told me there'd be a Revival
[49:09] in New York
[49:11] he said it's already come
[49:14] you didn't know it
[49:16] so then I'm not making that I've got to
[49:18] be wait till the great Revival comes
[49:22] before I can think
[49:25] I want to be ready every day
[49:29] but I believe
[49:31] you and I are missing
[49:33] the things that we should be looking at
[49:37] all right
[49:39] what is then brother Branham the
[49:42] coming of the Lord
[49:44] they were talking about remember coming
[49:46] of the Lord to the bride
[49:49] I keep saying that because you'd be
[49:50] surprised what them computers in brains
[49:53] them brains that you've got
[49:57] and I can say something and it'll cut
[49:58] off
[50:00] or you can go to sleep and you don't get
[50:02] it
[50:04] and then you think I said something that
[50:07] I didn't say
[50:10] that's why we take the tapes
[50:13] always have because
[50:15] they're there
[50:16] so you can show what I've done or but
[50:19] I'm also show you that I didn't do it
[50:21] all right
[50:24] because there's no way to listen when
[50:26] you're asleep there's no way to listen
[50:28] if you're thinking about what you're
[50:29] going to do when you get home this
[50:31] evening
[50:36] I mean you left the beans burning on the
[50:39] stove this morning don't worry about it
[50:41] your house is already burnt down
[50:50] just a little bit to shake us
[50:54] not talking about the coming of the Lord
[50:56] to the Jews not talking about the first
[50:59] stage of the coming of the Lord the life
[51:01] stage of the coming of the Lord first
[51:03] stage being 2 000 years ago
[51:06] my stage being in the millennium
[51:09] we're talking about what's going on
[51:13] and I said it this morning it's what
[51:15] I've always said
[51:16] and you tell me what else it is
[51:19] the coming of the Lord is the revealing
[51:22] of his word
[51:26] is the one thing that Satan cannot
[51:30] impersonate
[51:33] is that the wage of the prophet
[51:36] it can impersonate any gift any sign any
[51:39] Wonder
[51:40] but he can't bring the word word by word
[51:45] well Jesus never used any gift to
[51:48] conquer him
[51:51] we were listening to a type the other
[51:52] night right around said Jesus wouldn't
[51:55] even listen to him when the sake was
[51:57] talking to him
[51:58] I mean that was how much he was
[51:59] paraphrasing how much it was so you know
[52:03] Satan was trying to get him to you know
[52:05] cast your foot down he said he wasn't
[52:07] even listening to it
[52:13] see because what
[52:16] he knew what the word said
[52:19] I don't know
[52:22] I think you and I were to be open down
[52:24] to the place of getting to listening to
[52:26] the word Anyway by now
[52:29] not brother Branham would you talk to us
[52:31] a little bit about the
[52:33] coming of the Lord
[52:35] in relationship to some of the things
[52:37] you spoke of
[52:39] in your ministry
[52:41] go ahead to number two brother
[52:44] they go to Christ the Mr God reveal
[52:46] paragraph 106 and 107.
[52:50] God's Great mixture of how it's a secret
[52:53] he kept it a secret
[52:55] nobody know nothing about it even the
[52:58] angels didn't understand it see he
[53:00] didn't reveal it now what's he talking
[53:02] about
[53:03] what's the thing the Angels didn't know
[53:05] that Jesus said
[53:08] he said even I don't know
[53:10] about his coming
[53:13] right
[53:15] all right
[53:16] that's the reason under our seventh
[53:18] mystery
[53:21] when the seventh seal was opened
[53:24] there was silence
[53:28] Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted
[53:30] to know when he would come
[53:32] he said it's not even the son himself
[53:35] don't know when it's going to happen
[53:37] see God has this all to himself it's a
[53:41] secret that's the reason there was
[53:43] silence in heaven
[53:44] first place of half an hour
[53:52] what's the reason there were silence
[53:57] nobody used to know anything about his
[53:59] coming
[54:04] right
[54:10] see and that's the reason they were shot
[54:13] well of course if anything been said or
[54:15] anything happened
[54:17] he would give away the secret right
[54:22] in heaven first place of half hour and
[54:25] seven Thunders uttered the voices
[54:28] and John was even forbidden to write it
[54:32] see the coming of the Lord
[54:38] does that need a great big ball of
[54:40] lightning to strike
[54:44] but around what is the coming of the
[54:46] lord it's the seventh seal
[54:48] what is the coming of the Lord is
[54:51] the secret coming of the Lord Jesus
[54:53] Christ
[54:55] it's the thing he didn't even know
[54:57] himself
[54:58] when he would come
[55:01] that's the one thing he can't one thing
[55:03] he hasn't revealed yet of how he will
[55:05] come and when he'll come it's a good
[55:08] thing he doesn't
[55:09] no now you can translate that no to
[55:12] k-n-o-w
[55:14] remote and I discussed this 40 something
[55:17] years ago you can translate that to no
[55:21] I asked to k-n-o-w as to nobody is to
[55:23] know
[55:25] or you can translate it or it's a good
[55:26] thing that he doesn't
[55:29] stop pause no
[55:32] if you did you're gonna put your nose
[55:34] down here
[55:39] see that's where they wasn't maybe
[55:41] following the point
[55:44] how are you going to translate what he
[55:46] said
[55:48] it's a thing they don't know either way
[55:49] is right
[55:52] all right
[55:53] she has showed now what he's coming
[55:57] he has showed or revealed it in every
[56:00] type
[56:01] that's in the Bible
[56:04] okay
[56:05] therefore the entire Bible
[56:08] is the revelation of God's mystery in
[56:11] Christ amen
[56:13] the entire Bible is expression a one
[56:17] goal that God had
[56:20] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[56:22] entire Bible
[56:23] was what
[56:25] was God's purpose the thing he wanted to
[56:28] achieve
[56:32] I thought the prophet said
[56:35] that it was to reveal himself to mankind
[56:41] I thought that was the goal
[56:44] the thing that God wanted
[56:47] was to reveal reveal himself
[56:50] to the creation he made I you know I'm
[56:52] sorry if I missed that one but
[56:55] what is it because the entire Bible is
[56:58] expressing one goal that God had one
[57:01] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[57:03] entire Bible and all the acts are the
[57:05] Believers in the Bible has been in type
[57:07] and expressing what God's Great goal is
[57:10] and now in this last day he has revealed
[57:15] it
[57:16] and shows it
[57:21] and God's help
[57:25] will we you'll see it right here this
[57:29] morning
[57:30] what the Lord had in his mind all along
[57:33] and has expressed it
[57:40] he's putting that in the seventh
[57:42] sealants
[57:44] what he's bringing
[57:49] he's coming
[57:52] yeah but it's silence
[57:55] in heaven
[57:57] first place a half hour
[58:00] how long do I have how long see you
[58:02] don't blinked your mind
[58:07] you want to know how long that is
[58:10] or what it's going to be
[58:14] like the seven Thunders
[58:17] he said
[58:19] in the seal book about 158
[58:22] perfect but it's pretty close it's in
[58:25] the first seal
[58:27] he said the Thunder's the voice of God
[58:29] when the seal breaks
[58:34] but you know what they've done in this
[58:35] message
[58:36] they picked out some brothers
[58:39] and they made brother so and so Thunder
[58:42] number one and brother so and so Thunder
[58:44] number two
[58:51] that one tickled me to death
[58:55] gonna happen to know a few of them that
[58:57] I care much about their Thunder
[59:01] you know
[59:03] I thought some of it was a lot of
[59:05] thunder
[59:08] no I'm not making a lot of them it's
[59:10] down like a like I believe it you know
[59:14] but you see
[59:16] we read what the prophet has said
[59:20] and he said the entire Bible
[59:22] was revealing
[59:24] God's hidden Mystery
[59:28] all right so
[59:30] if it is the coming of the Lord
[59:35] then he's been coming for
[59:39] six thousand years
[59:43] four thousand to get him here
[59:47] in the person of Jesus Christ
[59:51] two thousand
[59:52] to get him here
[59:54] and the Believers
[59:56] of the end time
[59:59] and all down to the ages you know
[1:00:03] see there was silence in heaven
[1:00:07] well okay
[1:00:10] now what is silence in heaven
[1:00:20] I can't hold my breath for half an hour
[1:00:25] and you'd get upset if I held my
[1:00:28] speaking for an half an hour illustrate
[1:00:30] but I hope you see what I mean
[1:00:36] and the prophet didn't say there wasn't
[1:00:38] something going on
[1:00:43] come on
[1:00:44] he read your silver he said they stand
[1:00:46] in awe
[1:00:48] who stands in all
[1:00:52] a-w-e every how you pronounce it
[1:00:58] somebody's seen it
[1:01:01] yeah but none of this that
[1:01:04] Daniel heard the Thunders
[1:01:08] am I quoting wrote about him
[1:01:11] John heard the Thunders
[1:01:14] am I quoting brother
[1:01:22] but they were forbidden to write it
[1:01:25] what
[1:01:26] the coming of the Lord
[1:01:33] well because the prophet said if they
[1:01:35] did
[1:01:37] Satan get a hold of it
[1:01:42] and it certainly wouldn't be silenced
[1:01:44] then
[1:01:46] what you were talking about the part of
[1:01:49] his coming to the bride
[1:01:55] in the part of receiving his bride or
[1:01:58] getting her ready
[1:02:02] you know
[1:02:03] then we can read what he has to say
[1:02:05] go ahead with number four
[1:02:12] remember in this parties to come to
[1:02:14] receive
[1:02:15] he came to redeem then he's coming to
[1:02:17] receive
[1:02:19] souls in prison now 63.
[1:02:22] paragraph 155.
[1:02:24] now he's coming to receive what he has
[1:02:27] redeemed
[1:02:30] that's his work he's done he's coming to
[1:02:33] receive it
[1:02:34] oh what what a Time
[1:02:36] he has proven it the seventh seal proved
[1:02:39] it
[1:02:41] come back and took the book
[1:02:43] of redemption
[1:02:46] well there's nothing going on brother
[1:02:48] Dale you said it a minute ago no I
[1:02:50] didn't say it a minute ago I said this
[1:02:52] silence
[1:02:56] I said your Prophet said they stand in
[1:02:58] awe
[1:03:02] and what's taking place riches haven't
[1:03:04] seal
[1:03:08] so then who's going to take the book of
[1:03:09] redemption
[1:03:14] to get among the people of the message
[1:03:16] their literal splits over one group
[1:03:19] saying the seventh seals broke the other
[1:03:22] group said the Seven Seals not broke
[1:03:27] which group are you in
[1:03:34] I'm asking a simple question
[1:03:36] you're going to be on one side or the
[1:03:38] other
[1:03:39] right well I really don't know well
[1:03:41] that's put you in the middle I guess
[1:03:47] he said well I can read your words to
[1:03:49] open unread you where it's not open
[1:03:55] we just read in the Bible in Revelations
[1:03:57] 8 1 that the lamb
[1:04:01] broke or opened the seventh seal
[1:04:07] the fact of telling it was silence
[1:04:11] means the author is in in saying that
[1:04:16] if nothing else
[1:04:18] the silence in heaven
[1:04:20] is enough to know
[1:04:22] that is opened
[1:04:29] well why did he well let's we'll read
[1:04:30] some quotes
[1:04:31] the seventh seal will never be made
[1:04:33] known to the public
[1:04:36] can't be
[1:04:40] you can't make the new birth
[1:04:42] known to the public right
[1:04:45] go out and tell the world are you born
[1:04:46] again
[1:04:48] I don't care what you talk
[1:04:51] they can't see it until they get born
[1:04:53] again
[1:04:57] you see what I'm talking about
[1:04:59] he says the seventh seal proves it
[1:05:04] it come back
[1:05:06] and took the book
[1:05:08] all right
[1:05:10] there's really no argument where the
[1:05:11] book's opened or not
[1:05:16] something being opened
[1:05:19] doesn't mean that it's revealed
[1:05:26] it was open to Daniel
[1:05:30] but he said seal it up
[1:05:35] it opened to John but he said seal it up
[1:05:40] all right
[1:05:42] what about you and I
[1:05:44] what is then
[1:05:47] this seventh seal
[1:05:51] he said now
[1:05:53] he is coming
[1:05:54] the hour of his coming
[1:05:59] you know he said Dar what would be the
[1:06:02] sign of the coming of the end of the
[1:06:04] world
[1:06:07] is coming
[1:06:11] all right
[1:06:15] look back before the
[1:06:17] seals broke
[1:06:20] 62.
[1:06:21] message called
[1:06:23] hey God
[1:06:27] well wait a minute let's drop back to
[1:06:29] five
[1:06:30] yeah going back to let's use five
[1:06:35] which is the seventh see you're not is
[1:06:37] paragraph 3 97 now we have in the
[1:06:40] completion here now by the grace of God
[1:06:41] all the ministry of the six sealed has
[1:06:44] been sealed up and we understand and
[1:06:46] know that the seventh seal is not to be
[1:06:48] known to the public
[1:06:50] I understand that
[1:06:52] he's coming and the hour of his coming
[1:06:56] winter destruction of the world
[1:06:59] and that's the intra
[1:07:01] you know he said what would be the sign
[1:07:03] of the coming
[1:07:05] of the end of the world in Matthew 24.
[1:07:08] that's where they ask him the questions
[1:07:10] I wrote it on up
[1:07:13] when you see this coming to past and no
[1:07:16] the time is nah see Israel's gathering
[1:07:19] in his own Homeland but you notice he
[1:07:23] omitted to revelation
[1:07:25] of this seventh seal
[1:07:30] and you're when the seventh seal when he
[1:07:32] opened it he also had omitted it again
[1:07:36] so we see that it's a complete mystery
[1:07:39] therefore the hour is not yet for these
[1:07:43] mystery to be known
[1:07:44] therefore
[1:07:46] we're this far and the rest of it will
[1:07:49] be known right around about the time
[1:07:51] that Jesus appears on Earth again for
[1:07:55] his right
[1:07:56] or whatever takes place at that time
[1:07:59] now until that time let's just all pray
[1:08:01] and live
[1:08:03] be a good Christian why
[1:08:07] because there's no way you're going to
[1:08:09] figure it out
[1:08:14] you can't figure it out
[1:08:16] amen you can't figure out the new birth
[1:08:24] if you don't have it you don't know what
[1:08:25] it is
[1:08:26] yet you can quote all the quotes
[1:08:30] but if you've never experienced it
[1:08:33] it's no good
[1:08:34] all right
[1:08:37] go on to the next one then like I said I
[1:08:38] got number six
[1:08:44] all right 35 the holy spirit always
[1:08:46] speaks of the word
[1:08:48] I've got many things to tell you you
[1:08:50] could not understand it now but when he
[1:08:52] comes he'll guide you to it that's the
[1:08:55] reason the coming of the seals at the
[1:08:57] finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:08:59] mystery of God should be finished
[1:09:02] to know who God is
[1:09:05] what he is how he lives his nature
[1:09:09] his being
[1:09:10] you're supposed to be all the way up
[1:09:12] here by that time
[1:09:15] he bringing us into the full stature of
[1:09:18] the Sons and Daughters of God a church
[1:09:19] that's washed in the blood of Jesus
[1:09:22] Christ
[1:09:23] that's bought without money
[1:09:25] is paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:30] all right look at the next one
[1:09:35] this is the first seal
[1:09:37] paragraph 171.
[1:09:40] I don't don't tell this just what it is
[1:09:43] you know we stand in what is you know
[1:09:45] the Lambs showing John
[1:09:49] he said now this is just what this is
[1:09:52] now what's under this seventh seal don't
[1:09:55] don't go down and tell that
[1:09:58] or if I tell John that
[1:10:00] then all down through the age the whole
[1:10:03] plan will be broke
[1:10:05] it's a secrecy he just wants to he's
[1:10:08] coming he said uh nobody's going to know
[1:10:12] when I'm coming I'm just coming see
[1:10:15] that's all
[1:10:16] it ain't for my it ain't for my business
[1:10:19] to know when
[1:10:22] I just want to be ready amen what about
[1:10:24] it
[1:10:26] what do you think about it
[1:10:32] what about this
[1:10:35] great mystery
[1:10:40] what is it
[1:10:43] well I left one of the papers in the
[1:10:45] office
[1:10:48] did you know this quote
[1:10:54] he said there was no need of writing it
[1:10:57] got it laying in my office and our
[1:10:58] artists didn't bring it
[1:11:01] you know why that
[1:11:03] the seventh seal was not written
[1:11:06] now we know and we've just read he would
[1:11:09] let out the mystery
[1:11:11] and no one was to know when he's coming
[1:11:16] but he said there was no need of us
[1:11:18] knowing it
[1:11:21] you know why
[1:11:24] he said because there's going to be a
[1:11:25] Prophet come
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:33] the word of the Lord comes to the
[1:11:34] prophet
[1:11:42] there's no need of writing it
[1:11:45] because you're going to stumble all over
[1:11:47] it
[1:11:50] they've done a bad enough job stumbling
[1:11:51] over it messing us up in our thinking
[1:11:55] but God sent a prophet
[1:11:58] that he could speak to
[1:12:03] and he could tell you what it is and
[1:12:06] what's going on
[1:12:11] but look at what he's saying
[1:12:16] so we're going to have to depend on him
[1:12:20] to understand
[1:12:24] what does he say it is
[1:12:27] what does he say the seventh seal is
[1:12:30] go to number 13 brother we'll jump over
[1:12:33] Feast of the trumpets
[1:12:37] paragraph 175.
[1:12:40] he's bringing it down and what does he
[1:12:42] say
[1:12:42] the seventh seal hasn't opened yet
[1:12:45] you know
[1:12:47] that she's coming
[1:12:50] how more simple could you get
[1:12:52] a random one is the seventh seal that's
[1:12:55] just coming
[1:13:01] what simpler could you make it
[1:13:06] look what he says on the next one this
[1:13:08] is that was paragraph 175.
[1:13:12] look at 246 the Feast of the trumpet
[1:13:16] Pentecost Feast finished at the period
[1:13:18] of the seventh trumpet for the next is
[1:13:20] the coming of the seventh seal for the
[1:13:23] next is the mystery of the coming of
[1:13:25] Christ
[1:13:26] and also the trumpet is sound for the
[1:13:28] Jews
[1:13:30] the six he'll finish the mystery under
[1:13:33] the seal just before the Sabbath is open
[1:13:37] there was no need to write it because
[1:13:41] first off
[1:13:43] nobody could understand what was written
[1:13:49] now
[1:13:50] 40 something years of preaching about it
[1:13:56] I ask you the question
[1:13:58] do you think run around them could tell
[1:14:01] you something that Jesus couldn't tell
[1:14:03] you
[1:14:08] if you do you're putting a mighty a lot
[1:14:10] of hopes on
[1:14:11] and you're getting close to deity
[1:14:14] very close
[1:14:18] he said yeah but he could be waiting
[1:14:21] no
[1:14:24] because Jesus didn't know when he was
[1:14:26] coming
[1:14:32] you see
[1:14:35] what is the seventh sealed in it says
[1:14:37] coming
[1:14:43] the very thing that we've missed
[1:14:48] and yet we've read about it for 40
[1:14:49] something years
[1:14:52] simple little point of his coming
[1:14:56] I ask you
[1:15:00] to look up
[1:15:01] the word come
[1:15:04] okay I found this one
[1:15:07] they don't have it back there but
[1:15:09] questions and answers on the seals
[1:15:11] paragraph 66.
[1:15:14] now we find that the corruption that hit
[1:15:16] in the seventh Church age
[1:15:19] but the seventh seal doesn't reveal
[1:15:21] anything
[1:15:22] what's going to happen to it
[1:15:25] because at the end of that church age
[1:15:28] is to come a prophetic gift
[1:15:30] to reveal these things he
[1:15:33] are you following it
[1:15:36] a prophetic gift
[1:15:38] to all of my Independence is upon one
[1:15:40] thing
[1:15:43] is whether or not that Prophet knew what
[1:15:45] he's talking about
[1:15:48] but knew what he's talking about for our
[1:15:50] age
[1:15:52] and our time
[1:15:57] and brother random what is
[1:16:00] seven seal
[1:16:05] this is taken from 229
[1:16:07] of the seventh seal message
[1:16:10] we must remember that the seventh seal
[1:16:14] is the end of all things
[1:16:18] things written in the seven seal book
[1:16:20] sealed up of the Plan of Redemption
[1:16:23] and the founders of the world every bit
[1:16:25] ends did you ever go look up the word
[1:16:28] end
[1:16:31] did you ever look up the word come
[1:16:36] summer grin ain't shaking their heads I
[1:16:38] guess
[1:16:42] he read the definition
[1:16:46] was you listening to the words
[1:16:51] the word come means to be here
[1:16:58] that's literally what it means
[1:17:02] so you're thinking of the word comments
[1:17:04] some form of travel some form of doing
[1:17:08] and I would say to you I'd say oh no
[1:17:11] brother Marlow you and sister Marlow
[1:17:14] come to see us
[1:17:17] we say to you that means you've got to
[1:17:19] travel
[1:17:21] to me it doesn't mean that
[1:17:25] I'm not concerned with your traveling
[1:17:30] I'm warning you in my presence
[1:17:36] that's where I differed with the perusia
[1:17:38] parsia brothers because
[1:17:41] I said it means in his presence
[1:17:45] I said a God standing beside heavy
[1:17:47] you'll have to kill you
[1:17:51] right
[1:17:54] any of us goody goody enough that we'd
[1:17:57] like to stand in his presence for a
[1:17:58] little while
[1:18:01] they said brother Jack Cole and brother
[1:18:03] Tatum used to tell about brother George
[1:18:06] and him
[1:18:07] little brother Jack Coley pretty bad
[1:18:09] call out things
[1:18:13] and they said he'd start calling out a
[1:18:15] few things and the line that just start
[1:18:17] dropping out
[1:18:20] people come to be prayed for but they
[1:18:22] didn't want their life revealed
[1:18:28] you see
[1:18:31] what about you and I
[1:18:34] that we want our life revealed
[1:18:38] peruzia parsia means his presence
[1:18:42] it also means the presence of the
[1:18:44] Antichrist
[1:18:45] because it's the same word used for him
[1:18:49] well do you think the Antichrist is in
[1:18:51] you
[1:18:52] rather not be
[1:18:54] nobody's present
[1:18:57] right
[1:18:59] and you tell me the devil ain't got
[1:19:01] nothing to do with me I tell you no
[1:19:02] that's right he's already got you
[1:19:04] solved a problem
[1:19:07] because the devil had a lot to do with
[1:19:09] Jesus in the bases that he could tempt
[1:19:12] him
[1:19:12] right
[1:19:16] but then one day he turned around he
[1:19:17] says
[1:19:18] he don't have nothing to do with me
[1:19:20] evidently things are going to cut off
[1:19:22] about that time
[1:19:24] he said he don't have nothing to do with
[1:19:25] me and I don't know how to do with him
[1:19:31] so brother random said the seventh seal
[1:19:33] is the coming of the Lord that's his
[1:19:35] coming he said
[1:19:37] all right
[1:19:43] and if this is coming
[1:19:46] then he's not traveling
[1:19:49] that's where we get in those big words
[1:19:51] see we want to do what we don't think
[1:19:55] the word come means to appear
[1:19:59] or to be there
[1:20:03] but in scriptural terms
[1:20:06] the new birth is not just a presence of
[1:20:09] something with you
[1:20:12] you agree with that you did this morning
[1:20:15] somebody you shook your head anyway a
[1:20:18] little bit this morning
[1:20:19] the new birth is not just God standing
[1:20:22] beside of you that is known you birth
[1:20:26] the new birth that started the coming of
[1:20:29] the Lord to you
[1:20:33] was God coming in you
[1:20:38] do you agree with that
[1:20:41] amen within his second coming would not
[1:20:43] be something exterior
[1:20:49] it'd be the revealing of his word
[1:20:52] so as you start with a new birth
[1:20:55] how do you get virtue
[1:20:57] well I just need it so I just go get it
[1:20:59] I'll buy it knowledge tempers
[1:21:01] no
[1:21:04] takes a revealing of his word
[1:21:09] everyone says you birthed into this
[1:21:10] birthed into this birth into this
[1:21:13] statue of perfect man right
[1:21:16] it means of coming forth into
[1:21:19] the new birth
[1:21:21] put Christ in you
[1:21:24] Paul said the hope of glory
[1:21:26] not Christ beside of you
[1:21:30] so what would be his second coming
[1:21:36] it would have to be dealing with an
[1:21:37] inside
[1:21:40] is that simple language everybody says
[1:21:42] I'm so deep
[1:21:44] I get so tickled
[1:21:47] in people's terminologies brother Dale
[1:21:49] is so deep I can't understand him
[1:21:52] can't understand it your new birth puts
[1:21:54] Christ in you
[1:21:56] what would be the coming of the Lord
[1:22:05] excuse me anything up what started
[1:22:10] see that couldn't be done you know what
[1:22:13] brother run said
[1:22:15] these virtues are required
[1:22:19] it took him 30 something years he said
[1:22:22] before he could preach
[1:22:27] and you know what he said
[1:22:30] he said these the Thunders will bring
[1:22:33] the virtues
[1:22:37] that's why you started that seventh
[1:22:39] anniversary Doctrine Back Down Yonder
[1:22:42] of course that man had it all figured
[1:22:44] out he's going to tell you when you got
[1:22:47] one he's going to tell you when you got
[1:22:49] two he's going to tell you when the next
[1:22:51] virtue came he's going to tell you that
[1:23:02] what are you thinking about on this
[1:23:04] coming
[1:23:05] what are you looking for
[1:23:11] well brother Dale I'm looking for well
[1:23:13] she said well I go a great move to come
[1:23:16] I'm looking for that too
[1:23:19] but around said God will do in one year
[1:23:22] what theologists theologians are when he
[1:23:24] used the word would do in 2000 years but
[1:23:27] you don't go to arrest him but say he's
[1:23:29] doing it now
[1:23:30] that's questions and answers he's doing
[1:23:34] it now
[1:23:35] what's going to bring the virtues I
[1:23:37] asked brother moat that question 40
[1:23:39] years ago
[1:23:41] what's going to bring to virtues
[1:23:47] the Lord spoke to me one day and said
[1:23:49] the opening of the word will bring it
[1:23:53] because the virtues will come into being
[1:23:57] as the voice of God is spoken unto you
[1:24:00] and I and revealing his word to you and
[1:24:02] I
[1:24:03] wouldn't that be his coming
[1:24:08] that's more simple can you get
[1:24:11] all right
[1:24:16] so the seventh seal is the coming of the
[1:24:18] Lord
[1:24:21] the coming of the Lord has always been a
[1:24:22] secret
[1:24:28] it's the one thing Satan cannot
[1:24:30] impersonate
[1:24:35] he don't know how to impersonate it
[1:24:39] yeah but what about the quote word ain't
[1:24:41] broke yet
[1:24:42] okay I just read one where he said
[1:24:45] it can never be made known to the public
[1:24:50] there are things about it we were
[1:24:51] talking at lunch while ago about this
[1:24:53] coming that I'm talking about there's
[1:24:55] things that hasn't taken place yet
[1:25:02] the coming of the Lord will consummate
[1:25:04] to you and I in the basis of the Dead
[1:25:07] being raised that hasn't taken place yet
[1:25:11] that's why brother Brandon would say in
[1:25:13] one sentence
[1:25:15] he's here
[1:25:17] and he said I'm looking for his coming
[1:25:20] we were talking about how he would stand
[1:25:22] there
[1:25:23] and he said you know what I'm doing I'm
[1:25:25] waiting on him
[1:25:28] well he had the Holy Ghost Inside of him
[1:25:31] who was he waiting on
[1:25:35] he's waiting on a personal presence amen
[1:25:37] different from that new birth they're
[1:25:39] not different but yet something that
[1:25:42] would show him these things
[1:25:44] it's a new birth would not show him
[1:25:49] the coming of the Lord is revealing of
[1:25:51] his word
[1:25:54] has he revealed to you his coming
[1:25:58] are you still looking for it
[1:26:04] the random said the biggest force in the
[1:26:06] Old Testament was fulfilled in the Life
[1:26:09] scriptures and prophecies
[1:26:12] with the last few hours
[1:26:15] on the cross
[1:26:18] could it end that way again
[1:26:23] let me go back about 40 years ago to
[1:26:25] some statements I made
[1:26:29] as I started off while ago talking about
[1:26:31] it I don't believe brother Branham could
[1:26:33] tell us something that Jesus couldn't
[1:26:35] tell us
[1:26:42] I believe Jesus told us that's the
[1:26:44] reason brother random could tell us
[1:26:50] Jesus preached six seals in Matthew 24.
[1:26:57] he omitted the seventh
[1:27:02] you know what
[1:27:05] because that's who he was
[1:27:08] is that simple enough
[1:27:11] he was the seventh that was his coming
[1:27:16] right
[1:27:18] come on how many times I've made this
[1:27:20] statement he comes first time
[1:27:22] redeem is bright second time with his
[1:27:25] bride you know I mean just catch his
[1:27:27] right away third time with his pride
[1:27:30] so when Jesus Christ stood on this earth
[1:27:32] right there was that seventh seal
[1:27:35] standing there
[1:27:36] amen God himself
[1:27:39] in human flesh
[1:27:46] that's why he didn't talk about his
[1:27:47] coming
[1:27:49] right
[1:27:51] you know why Jesus didn't talk about his
[1:27:53] coming because he was Hebrews 13 8.
[1:28:00] right
[1:28:03] he knew who he was and what was going on
[1:28:10] he never he didn't know the day in the
[1:28:13] hour
[1:28:14] that he was coming no
[1:28:17] ours brought around and said that coming
[1:28:19] would be completed to make sure to get
[1:28:21] it right when what are you saying
[1:28:24] Jesus didn't know when he was coming
[1:28:26] physically because he was a human man
[1:28:27] standing there
[1:28:31] that that human man
[1:28:34] said I do nothing
[1:28:36] until the father shows me
[1:28:39] where was the father
[1:28:46] I thought he said unless you believe
[1:28:49] that I am healed on your sin so I
[1:28:51] thought the father was in him
[1:28:55] but that flesh man outside there
[1:28:59] was not eternal
[1:29:03] that's our problems right now
[1:29:05] our problem is
[1:29:07] in our brain and our spirit
[1:29:10] our human part of us is not eternal
[1:29:16] that's our problem
[1:29:18] when that becomes Eternal we won't have
[1:29:20] any trouble
[1:29:21] but until then we got troubles
[1:29:25] Paul said the thing I would I would not
[1:29:28] think I'd do it he said then what is it
[1:29:31] he said within the law of My Flesh
[1:29:37] right
[1:29:41] one part of me I serve God
[1:29:44] another part of me I serve the flesh
[1:29:49] um
[1:29:51] but when you quote that Jesus said
[1:29:55] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[1:29:57] earth
[1:30:00] how many of you know that was written
[1:30:02] after
[1:30:04] his resurrection
[1:30:09] read your Bible
[1:30:11] he never said that when he was on Earth
[1:30:13] because he had to wait on the father to
[1:30:14] move him
[1:30:16] I do nothing until the father shows me
[1:30:19] when he come to that him and the father
[1:30:21] had come back to being totally won
[1:30:27] what is the coming of the Lord Brother
[1:30:28] Dale
[1:30:30] I believe it's the revealing of God's
[1:30:33] word
[1:30:34] and that's why I pray and study
[1:30:39] listen to tapes
[1:30:40] do the best I can
[1:30:42] love to deer hunt
[1:30:44] when I go down in the woods
[1:30:47] and I put a
[1:30:49] brother's here fix me up a thing and I
[1:30:51] put it on there and I've listened to
[1:30:53] three tapes sitting on deer stand
[1:30:57] actually that cycle right through
[1:30:59] I've slept through some of them
[1:31:03] problems telling you
[1:31:05] I slept through some of them
[1:31:08] I do pretty good I tie myself to the
[1:31:10] tree
[1:31:14] but I've slept through tapes yeah
[1:31:18] but I've also heard it over and over
[1:31:23] I told you about how that
[1:31:27] we listened to
[1:31:29] the unveiling of God
[1:31:31] five days in a row
[1:31:34] going to work
[1:31:36] the fifth day
[1:31:38] it hit me
[1:31:42] he said I come in three sons names
[1:31:48] son of a man Son of God Son of David
[1:31:52] and after all that listening it struck
[1:31:54] me what he was saying Son of God her son
[1:31:58] of man in life died Rose Son of God
[1:32:03] you can't go from Son of God to the son
[1:32:05] of David
[1:32:07] he had to come back in the end time as
[1:32:09] son of man
[1:32:11] right what a wonderful Bible you and I
[1:32:15] have for a message
[1:32:18] that we've got the answer that Satan
[1:32:21] don't like amen Satan don't care how
[1:32:25] much you listen to tapes he don't care
[1:32:29] how much you
[1:32:31] pray
[1:32:32] he don't care how much you shout how
[1:32:35] much you cry how much you do anything
[1:32:40] all he's trying to do is keep you from
[1:32:42] believing Who You Are
[1:32:46] did the prophet time I want to go did
[1:32:48] the prophet say when the bride realizes
[1:32:50] who she is
[1:32:53] she'll be gone
[1:32:55] she'd be an invincible Army
[1:32:58] when she realizes who she is
[1:33:01] what do you think brother random could
[1:33:03] have so much Authority and thing he knew
[1:33:06] who he was
[1:33:08] he wasn't looking for the coming of the
[1:33:10] Lord he knew the Lord was right there
[1:33:15] right I'm not looking for the coming of
[1:33:17] the Lord I'm looking at the coming of
[1:33:19] the Lord
[1:33:21] which is the revealing of his word
[1:33:25] and to me that's the great seventh seal
[1:33:27] that is a mystery
[1:33:32] it's not some Secret
[1:33:34] down underneath
[1:33:38] come on I've always it's been straight
[1:33:40] forward with you I tell you my faults
[1:33:42] and my favors
[1:33:46] I first went to Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:33:48] I looked up there and I saw a cross
[1:33:51] and Down Under that cross was i n r i
[1:33:57] wrote that down
[1:33:59] there's a new name
[1:34:02] there's a new name INRI
[1:34:05] now all I got to know is what that means
[1:34:09] I come outside to brother mode I said
[1:34:11] brother MO
[1:34:12] would you mind telling me something I
[1:34:15] didn't tell him
[1:34:16] you know what I was thinking about I
[1:34:19] said would you mind telling me what it
[1:34:20] means i n r i he said Jesus Christ King
[1:34:24] of the Jews
[1:34:29] I wasn't dumb enough to tell him what I
[1:34:31] was thinking
[1:34:34] but see we're all human rights
[1:34:37] we've tried to figure out things try to
[1:34:39] do things but why not just make it
[1:34:41] simple
[1:34:43] and see what
[1:34:44] the prophet has to say
[1:34:49] that the seventh seal is the coming of
[1:34:51] the Lord
[1:34:56] and realize that we're not dealing with
[1:34:57] that back fairness over here
[1:34:59] so he's coming as he reveals his self
[1:35:06] the great headstone that we've looked to
[1:35:08] come
[1:35:10] the Priestess 40 something years to you
[1:35:12] I believe that headstone is this message
[1:35:16] amen
[1:35:19] this message revealed to you and I is
[1:35:22] the headstone
[1:35:26] but it was what Jesus preached
[1:35:28] because right around him never added one
[1:35:30] word to what Jesus had to say now if you
[1:35:33] did then the Bible is against him
[1:35:35] because it says
[1:35:37] you can't add a word or take a word out
[1:35:40] you better watch what you're saying
[1:35:44] he broke down into human language
[1:35:47] what the Bible was saying
[1:35:50] but he never told us something
[1:35:53] that Jesus couldn't tell us
[1:35:57] so with Eric stood in Matthew 24 he
[1:36:00] preached six sealed he didn't have to
[1:36:02] preach the seventh that's who he was
[1:36:04] he was standing there
[1:36:10] when the prophet finished them seals
[1:36:14] he said he's here
[1:36:19] he said as great as he's ever been
[1:36:21] outside of the Corporal body
[1:36:27] what do you think
[1:36:28] come on brothers
[1:36:30] what do you think
[1:36:35] he said well you told us about the word
[1:36:37] come
[1:36:39] but you didn't tell us about the word
[1:36:40] end
[1:36:44] because brother Branham wouldn't run
[1:36:45] around and said the seventh seal is the
[1:36:47] end of all things
[1:36:50] I went home
[1:36:51] I got a dictionary
[1:36:54] and I looked up the word
[1:36:57] e and D
[1:37:03] how many of you ever looked it up
[1:37:05] the word e n d
[1:37:09] end
[1:37:11] see we think in means you come out you
[1:37:15] fell off her cliff
[1:37:17] that's the end
[1:37:20] the Bible says the end of all things has
[1:37:21] come upon us
[1:37:25] back there they could say the end of all
[1:37:28] things
[1:37:29] 2 000 years ago they could say the end
[1:37:32] of all things
[1:37:35] the word in doesn't mean
[1:37:38] cut off point
[1:37:46] if you'll take one simple example and
[1:37:48] think about it
[1:37:50] when you're walking up a set of steps
[1:37:53] you take the first step
[1:37:57] what is the end of the first step
[1:38:01] he said what are you kicking them back
[1:38:03] okay that's the foundation for the next
[1:38:05] one
[1:38:10] right
[1:38:12] the end of the first step is the second
[1:38:15] step
[1:38:17] you don't annihilate it
[1:38:21] the end of the second step is the third
[1:38:24] what did Brother Brown say the end of
[1:38:27] the first seal
[1:38:31] what's the end of the first seal
[1:38:34] the opening of the second one
[1:38:38] how much simpler can anybody make it
[1:38:41] the end of the first seal is the opening
[1:38:43] and of the second one
[1:38:48] so the end of The Sixth Seal would have
[1:38:50] been the opening of the seventh
[1:38:55] which means he's here
[1:38:59] he's not coming
[1:39:00] come doesn't mean that way look it up
[1:39:03] literally come means to be
[1:39:06] and like I've tried to express it
[1:39:09] I'm home I'm away and I come home to my
[1:39:12] wife
[1:39:17] I don't come home to my wife to walk in
[1:39:19] and say hi honey got supper ready I know
[1:39:22] I've been gone a month
[1:39:26] where is my wife
[1:39:31] she's in my arms
[1:39:36] there's your word come
[1:39:41] it literally means to be enguffed
[1:39:46] into what you're doing
[1:39:48] you have reached your goal
[1:39:51] you have reached your your point
[1:39:55] you traveled into my house
[1:39:57] nothing to do with it it's when you
[1:39:59] stand in my house
[1:40:02] your coming is finished
[1:40:07] the end
[1:40:08] not falling off a cliff
[1:40:12] in the Bible nothing ever ends
[1:40:15] the devil and all that does yeah but we
[1:40:17] don't talk about that
[1:40:21] the end of this world
[1:40:23] will be the beginning
[1:40:25] of Eternity
[1:40:27] you agree with that
[1:40:30] you see how simple it is if you think
[1:40:33] the end of this world is the beginning
[1:40:36] of Eternity
[1:40:39] but Iran said it's the end of all times
[1:40:41] he said it even ends at Sabbath seal
[1:40:45] he says like a Roman Candle
[1:40:48] that goes up and shoots out
[1:40:51] shoots out you better remember one thing
[1:40:55] our term of a Roman Candle only has
[1:40:58] seven or eight blacks to it right
[1:41:04] you ever shot a Roman Candle
[1:41:08] he'd shoot so many times and it Fizzles
[1:41:10] out
[1:41:12] not showing the gospel
[1:41:15] well the randomly is using that only to
[1:41:16] illustrate and it goes up and blinds out
[1:41:19] keeps opening each one of those keeps
[1:41:21] opening
[1:41:22] he's explaining it like the ripples on
[1:41:25] the ocean
[1:41:27] she toss a rock into a lake
[1:41:31] and the ripples never stop
[1:41:34] they go to the bank and they come back
[1:41:39] right
[1:41:41] the end of all things is come upon us
[1:41:50] I think it's really should be the end of
[1:41:52] our thinking
[1:41:53] would be the grass go ahead brother
[1:41:55] let's stand
[1:41:56] I hope you understand what I mean I
[1:41:58] didn't have no time for questions we'll
[1:42:00] take that Wednesday
[1:42:01] noted already 20 minutes till four
[1:42:06] we'll have questions and answers
[1:42:07] Wednesday
[1:42:20] what about the coming of the Lord
[1:42:23] I'm enjoying it
[1:42:43] this is that
[1:42:46] was spoken of by the Bible
[1:42:52] it's coming right now
[1:42:55] I know you're going to misunderstand it
[1:42:57] make me label something
[1:42:58] this coming is more important
[1:43:02] than that Millennial rain
[1:43:07] Millennial reign
[1:43:11] right if this coming is not completed
[1:43:13] won't be no millennium
[1:43:21] it's always up to you and I
[1:43:28] um

[1:50:47] to see
[1:50:55] you there's one to stand for Rick
[1:50:58] we all know the story in the situation
[1:51:00] is there enough
[1:51:02] mental hospital or what you call it
[1:51:04] whatever they got him now
[1:51:06] but he's still a human being you know
[1:51:10] we might not agree with him as to some
[1:51:12] things he would do or whatever happened
[1:51:14] but he's a human being
[1:51:17] so let's believe with our brother that
[1:51:19] God will touch him and he's called
[1:51:21] crying seeking help
