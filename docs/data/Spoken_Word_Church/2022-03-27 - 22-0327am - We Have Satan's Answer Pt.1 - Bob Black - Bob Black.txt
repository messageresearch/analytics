surrender to [Music] [Applause] i believe we've got satan's answer this morning let's just go straight into the word and uh just ask the lord to bless the reading of the word oh god we're so grateful to be able to gather together lord lord as we look into your word with confidence of what we believe and what we're standing here for lord jesus and we just pray lord that this morning's gathering will not be in vain lord god because lord we know lord we're not just gathering together to look at one another lord but we're here lord to receive something from you to know you more lord jesus in the power of your resurrection and we thank you god for all that you've given unto us lord jesus for your presence lord is already moving through the building lord there's many needs this morning lord jesus and we know lord that you're here to meet every need no matter what it is lord whether it's healing or salvation or a refilling lord jesus and i pray god that you feel at liberty this morning to move through the place and to quicken every heart that's in need lord jesus we ask your blessing of the reading of the word so psalm chapter 103 says i'm just gonna this is a scripture that you know we we we preach a lot about when we're when we're preaching but i'm just going to take this as my main text this morning and and sure enjoyed that sunday school lesson and and all of the singing and we certainly welcome our our visiting brother here uh we just i'll say like brother dale always says we you know you you come the first time and you're uh we welcome and you come you come the second time you're just part of us because we don't have nothing to nothing to join or not nothing to sign our name on or shake hands with or anything like that we're just born into the body so psalms chapter 103 says a psalm of david bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits we've got a lot of benefits that we can take advantage of who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all our diseases the lord at his blessing to the word this morning he may be seated so i want to just uh you know since uh i we're i'm taking both services today i i just want to speak on today this morning this afternoon about how that i believe we've got satan's answer and you know in this hour there's the you know you you come into church this morning and and as the songs are showing you can definitely feel the the presence of something beyond yourself and you know you just because you can feel something there's something that's real there's something that brother graham said it gives an unction to the preacher that that moves through the through the to the building that can give power to a christian to live a life that you couldn't live before you were saved and there's something that's real so we know that the presence of you know you should know just by coming into church this morning that there's a there's a real god but you know there's also there's also a devil and and there's and we believe that there's a real devil and the devil moves moves through situations and he's trying to try to take control of your life and try to change the direction of your life he'll try to change the direction of your your family or your your an individual or the church even and try to get people's minds going in a different direction but yet we we we've got you you can't you can't uh there's no way to defeat satan of your own abilities there's no way to defeat satan of your own with with your own doings or your own works or anything but there's one way that we can defeat satan and that's through god's word and and i believe that we've got satan's answer i believe that we've got an answer to nobody no matter what the devil throws at you whether he throws sickness at you whether he throws a mind battle at you a torment of of of your spirit whatever it is that we've got his answer and as we read here in psalms chapter 103 it says what what a great comfort and a blessing it is to look into god's word and see the privilege that he's given to us that when we go through rough times and we go through rough spots in our life that we can look and gain confidence in his word that to remember that that to remember the benefits that god has given to us bless the lord o my soul and for getting out all his benefits who forgive us all thy iniquities who healeth all thy diseases now i want you to notice there that it was in all it it's not saying sometimes part of the way or anything it's it's it's an all-inclusive package and that means if you've committed any sins or if you've committed any antiquities then you're at the right place to have all your iniquities wiped away to have all your sin wiped away to have the slate completely cleared and that goes the same way for healing if you've got a problem in your body a problem in your spirit or whatever it is if you need healing in your soul this is the right place to come if you need healing in your body this is the right place to come and i want to say you know and and maybe that will say that the the religious world of today there's a lot of people that have gotten away from believing that god still heals i believe that the bible says that he's hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he healed somebody in the old testament he's the same today if he healed somebody when the apostles were preaching he's the same today as he was back then because you can't get away from hebrews 13 8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever so we look many people will say well well god doesn't heal any people anymore he doesn't do miracles anymore but yet i believe because of that scripture and because of so many other testimonies through scripture and so many testimonies of christians lives down through the ages that he's still a miracle working god he's still able to heal now now we we co we we believe that god sent a prophet in this last day just like he sent uh he sent arenas and columba and and and and martin luther and and john wesley to the believers in those ages and now we believe that in this last stage that god sent a man named william branham to to to open up the things that a lot of people had probed at before like like for example that does god still do miracles and so a lot of things i'm going to be quoting this morning come from some of the things he say is like like this what that i will quote for you now no matter what you've done wrong god is here to forgive no matter what satan throws your way we've got the answer and and and so now satan what that means is satan does not have any legal rights this morning at all he don't have any legal why does he not have any legal rights because jesus christ on the cross died died to take away everything that the devil had done christ defeated him in our stead there at calvary and when he died he spoiled principalities and robbed satan of every power that he had now this morning i want to i think that should build up our faith and build up our confidence that if you've got a problem in your life jesus christ already paid he already paid the price for that on the cross and he robbed there he robbed satan there on the cross of every power that he could have over your life which is why in colossians chapter 2 verse 15 it says having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly he made a show there on the cross he made a show openly on the day of pentecost as they began to preach in the street proclaiming what christ had done he made a show openly when they told that that the lame man next to the gate beautiful right look look on us and we don't have any silver and gold but if you rise up and walk if you just believe rise up and walk and he made a show openly that that everything that the devil had had been yanked away from him made a show of them openly trying triumphing over them in it now see the church the church now has been commissioned we've got that commission that when the devil has control over somebody when the devil's tormenting somebody the church has been given this commission to deliberate somebody by the preaching of the gospel by laying hand on on hands to deliver somebody from these from from these torments the church has been commissioned to cast out devils in mark chapter 16 we read and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues so you see we've got a commission we've got a commission to fulfill that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever we've been commissioned to cast out devils and you know this is this gospel that i'm preaching this morning is not sometimes we get in our mind that this is just a gospel for old people or a gospel for grandpa or something for old folks something for the people in the old folks home but this gospel is something for everybody you know daniel was a young man and josiah was a young man and and all you've got today david was a young man and this this gospel is for the old and for the young and for the infirm and for the weak and for the strong and the it's for everybody it doesn't matter who you are or what your situation in life is for is this morning whatever you are whether you're old or weak you can be loosed from the situation that you're in this morning what are you doing brother bob i'm preaching the gospel this morning the gospel was sent to loose those what they were bound the gospel they were sent to set you free from whatever torment the devil has in your life this morning because the gospel says in matthew chapter 18 it says verily i say unto you now these are the words of jesus christ to us the words of christ to us that we're supposed to be fulfilling now he said whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again i say unto you that if two of you now now think about what a great thing is if two of you if two holy ghosts feel believers in the church get together and they start thinking the same way and they start becoming an agreement that you know we don't have to take what the devil has put on us anymore we don't have to sit there and just accept the torment in our spirit we don't have to accept this broken body that i'm living in i don't have to accept it and you begin to lay hands upon one another and get into a spirit of agreement like they were in the upper room in one accord that something is going to happen he said again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven i believe this morning we can have come with confidence with with that kind of confidence that it's going to be done if you come believing what god has already said and these are not my words and these are not the words of any man but these are the words of christ that he spoke to the church that you don't have to settle to be tormented by the devil for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them and i think we've seen the evidence of that scripture this morning as we've gathered and as we've sung the songs of praise and worship that christ has gathered together in our midst he's here and he's moving the angels of god and kept around them that fear him and we have a proof that god is with us now what is what is the devil what is the devil we know that god is here and we know that we know that the lord is here to fight our battles and we know that we have an answer for satan so what is satan you know when you beg when you can begin to understand what what what the devil is and what he's doing then you you begin to lose your fear of him you begin to realize that he's nothing but a bluff like brother ryan was said as the word as the picture becomes more clear this morning as he was speaking on the picture begins to unfold of what we're doing here what our purpose is and you begin to understand by revelation because you begin revelation is what gives you gives you the ability to to go up against the devil he said a devil a demon now listen a demon devil all comes from one word and in the english it's called tormentor tormentor that's what the devil is if you think about maybe maybe this morning you're tormented in your mind maybe you're wondering maybe you're wondering can i can i be forgiven can i be saved maybe you're wondering maybe maybe you're born again and you're you're in your spirit the devil's been putting all kinds of lies and things about whether maybe you're backslidden and you're going you're going back you you've forgotten what your purpose is in life and and you're you're turning off the off the way and and you begin to wonder is there any hope for me have i gone too far and that's what the devil's job is the devil is his job is to torment you and plague your mind and plague plague your thoughts and make you think somebody's talking about you behind your back or make you think somebody doesn't like you and it's constantly a torment but yet there is a relief from that that's what the holy ghost was given to come into the church to relieve you from the torment that's to come into the church and give you a rest that's what that rest is that jesus jesus talked about i will give you a rest come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and i'll give you a rest a rest that the world can't give the alcohol and the drugs and all that can't give you a rest but he'll give you a rest that only he can give and that demon that demon will come in if you're not born again he can come into your soul and torment your soul a tormentor is a a torment even in the natural it's a person who inflicts severe mental or physical suffering on somebody i was thinking about if you read in history about fox's book of martyrs how the how they they would torment the catholic church with torment people that believed different with them and they would they would they would put them on a rack and stretch them and i began to read all these stories about how one man he was out on a rack and and and he was being his they had him on that rack where he was being stretched and he looked and all of a sudden next to him appeared an angel and it began to wipe his brows he was being stretched on that rack because he was being tormented there was a a physical a person there that was put put him on that rack and they had all these devices you think about what could what could make a man torment somebody else what could make somebody want to torment their brother their their natural brother what could makes what only the devil because that's the the devil is the tormentor a devil is something that will make somebody make somebody feel miserable and brother adam said many times you see a person maybe of insanity they may maybe even a converted person feel with the holy spirit and yet be totally insane he said that's got nothing to do with the soul it's a tormentor see something that torments them what a strange thing that you could be born again but tormented in your spirit and plagued by something that's tormented in your body tormented tormented because that's what the devil does torment of the spirit what is that does god love me you begin to think that maybe god don't love you anymore that's why you got to come to church because church is where you get proved that god still loves you because he'll speak to you he'll speak to words of life from behind the pulpit something something that you have need of and it'll go out and begin to speak words of comfort and ones of joy and peace and you'll know that god still cares you begin to wonder god does god still care about me does anybody ever care is there any hope and you begin to maybe get into a place of of maybe where you where you're wondering should i kill myself is is all hope lost the devil is a tormentor brother branham said he's here to tear up your body to eat you up to destroy you shorten your three score and ten if you can but you know i believe this morning that we've got an answer for all that torment we've got an answer and that answer is jesus christ that answer is the baptism of the holy ghost that answer is his word you know the bible even says that we're supposed to be ready to give an answer it's first peter 3 15 it says sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear and what is the reason of the hope that what is the answer the answer that we can give when somebody asks us why do you dress that way because i believe jesus christ because i've been transformed by from the old way that i was living for the world into a new creation why do you talk the way that you do why do you talk with comfort and joy why do you talk with faith believing that no matter what the devil throws at me yet there's there's something real that i believe no matter what sickness i have in my life yet i know that god is still a healer brother adam said we as human beings have no power against the devil so we don't come to meet him in the name of a church or an organization but satan is defeated he is defeated and we come to meet him in the name of our conqueror jesus christ we come to meet him in that name now think about the devil the devil could torment the devil could torment a believer the devil will come and torment but he can't make one move he can't make one move unless he's permitted to do so you think about job when satan answered the lord and said does job fear god for naught do they fear does he fear god for knowing how not made him hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substances increased in the land god the devil could not do one thing to job unless god allowed it he couldn't do one thing to him when when jesus was standing there in front of pilate he said the al qaedas have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin that pilate could not do one thing to jesus unless it was allowed and you see god sometimes he will he will pull back the protection let's let's understand this this morning i believe this will give us confidence a confidence that we're living life for a purpose there's a reason sometimes why things happen to us there's a reason sometimes why god allows us to get sick because there's a purpose in our life and sometimes god will roll back that hedge of protection why did you roll it back from job's case to prove to the devil that somebody was going to stand for god sometimes sometimes you know that's what even sometimes that might be what happened is happening in your life you'll go through a little rough spot maybe think about this maybe god is standing back boasting to the devil i i don't care what you do that person is not going to believe and you know in this day god is going to have a bride that will not do like eve but she will stand for the word no matter what it doesn't matter what comes her way she is going to she's going to not not to be one word off so there is a purpose to what god allows god knows if you are sick god knows if you're needy he knows he is not oblivious he know he's he's a he we have a high priest that is touched by the feelings of our infirmities and he know he knows even before you ask it maybe he maybe he just wants to prove to the devil that you you're going to believe god anyhow or maybe he's trying to get you to a place of repentance a place where you begin to realize that you need god he's trying to maybe get trying to get you to a place where you begin to understand what your need is maybe he's getting you allowing the devil to maybe get you to a place of middle anguish to drive you to your knees to begin to get in your back closet and begin to call out to god get down beside your bed at night and begin to pray to god and say you know what i'm tired of the way that i've been living i'm tired of the way that i've been walking maybe you begin to get weak so that you can be conscious of your frailty maybe you you begin to get sick so that you're reminded that your days on earth are few you know sometimes you get a flu and you begin to be more conscious of you know one of these days i'm i if something don't happen i'm going to go down in the grave you begin to get real sick and you begin to get consciousness everything you know some something's different and it begins to give you a consciousness that you need something you need god and yeah but see everything everything is working toward a purpose and romans chapter 8 it says and we know that all things work together we know all things work together everything can you say that this morning that you know that everything that happens to you works it works for a purpose we know all things work together for according to for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose now you can't say that now at least you're really confident that you love god that he's called you that he foreknew you you know people out there in the hockey tank don't can't say that you know the people out there doing living living living for the world they can't say that well i know everything's working the good to the good for for those are called according to his purpose but a christian can say that but and what is your purpose your purpose now the purpose is you're in romans chapter 8 it says for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so we have a purpose this morning and your purpose is to be conformed to the image of his son to be conformed to that means to be molded and to be changed until you're just like jesus until you can walk like jesus and talk like jesus until until the devil can come to you like he did jesus as he and his as he went into the wilderness and throw all those different temptations in front of him why don't you make bread why don't you go up high on on a building why don't you make something big of yourself why don't you go after popularity or won't why don't you go after money and you can come to a place where you're cut so conformed to the image that's what the bible says conform to the image of his son until the devil can't do nothing with you so what is your purpose in life that's why that's why things happen to you that's why you get sick sometimes it's to bring because there's a purpose being fulfilled in your life there's a purpose you have a purpose and your purpose is not to have a lot of money and not have to work your purpose is not to be able to play video games all day your purpose is not to be respected in the community those things are good sometimes to be respectful your purpose is not to retire early although that would be wonderful that would be wonderful to be able to retire early and sit home in my easy chair and your purpose is not to be successful on your own terms your purpose is to be conformed to the image of his son to be conformed you know what that means despite all the hardships you may that i believe that would change that should change our mindset to where we're almost more willing to go through suffering and hard times to be conformed to the image of his son because that's what his purpose is in our life to be conformed into the image of jesus christ to be conformed into the image where where you've got these virtues that you've got the virtue of life the actual life of christ living in you the knowledge where you know that he's the same yesterday today and forever whether you've got the same kind of temperance where god is in control of your life where you've got patience to deal with one another and patience to wait on god where you could wait like abraham did if it takes 25 years you can wait because you know he's hebrews 13 8 and you've got godliness to act like god even knowing that if if you've got to endure trials and tribulations yet god is working a purpose in your life and that makes you like god and brotherly kindness to give grace to one another and not hold things over one another's head because that's what your purpose is maybe maybe this morning i pray that that would give liberty to some of us to know that whatever things you're going through in life that you've got a purpose and if you love god and god loves you everything in life is working toward that purpose if you love god and god loves you if you're walking in his word everything is working toward that purpose but now god is god is not the author of sickness what what are you i'm preaching on sickness this morning sometimes we forget that god is a healer god is still a healer god didn't author sickness though sickness came from the devil we're talking about how that sometimes god will back off and let things happen to you happen in your life but god is not the one that's that authored that sickness he'll back off and let things happen to you to bring you to a place of repentance to bring you to a place where you realize that you need something for god but god is not the author of that sickness you say well how could this is what some of some of the atheists think how how could a god how could a good god stand by and watch somebody pull out a gun in school and shoot somebody how could a good god stand by and let let somebody get sick how could a good god let let stand by and let the holocaust happen how could a good god let that happen well let's take the school shooting how could a good god stand by and let somebody pull a gun out in school and shoot up a lot of youth because god will not override your free moral agency you do you realize let's think about that now you cannot properly express love unless you have free will you cannot express how could god stand by and let adam and eve make the wrong choice and kill the whole earth get everything out of kilter how could he stand by and do that because he wants you to make a choice and if you don't have the right to make a choice then love cannot be expressed well think about your wife if you forced your wife or your spouse to marry you love could not be expressed because you cannot express love if you're forcing somebody even this morning you know as i look out on the on the christian world and his own situations that i i know about i wish that i could force somebody to walk different or do different but i can't force and know because love cannot be expressed if you force you've got to have the ability to respond that man that man maybe that would pull a gun out in a school and begin to shoot things up it it's his choice you see how god allows us to choose he wants you to choose life and this morning you've got the ability to either choose life or death you've got the ability to choose and it's not because a minister forced you to raise your hand or forced you to come to the altar or forced you to open up your heart and give your life to god but it's because you did it because you responded to god when you felt that little pulse sitting in your hearts that god drawing you because the bible says that no man can come to me except the father draw him and when the father begins to draw you and move you because you heard the word it's you responding it's not because somebody grabbed you by the nape of the neck and dragged you up to the altar but you responded love cannot be expressed without free will you remember brother brown telling that story about his son was out in the world playing cards and and and doing drinking alcohol and doing things he shouldn't and billy paul and and then he began to come back in church and he was sitting there on the pew and people began to come to the altar and this the spirit was moving through the church and and billy paul didn't respond maybe he was thinking i i maybe i should go up there and the old deacon in the church came up and tapped him on the shoulder and said shouldn't you go up there and brother brown later admonished that deacon why did he admonish the deacon because you can't force it's got to be your choice you can't grab somebody and you think sometimes about how how we raise our children you can't force your kids you can't force your kids to love going to church we've got to back off and let them make their own choice you remember that story brother i'm told about how that moses parents that they came to a place where they knew that they if they held on to moses that he was gonna die but they they came to a place where they had they knew they had to turn him over to god and put him in the bull rush and just watch him watch him sail away through all the hippos and all the all the all the animals all the anacondas whatever wild beasts were out there and they knew that god was going to protect him you know sometimes we've got to do that we got to take a step back and send let our kids go to the youth camp so that we're out of the way let's take a step back and let god begin to do something and i believe god is still able to do something i believe god is able to do more than abundantly anything we could all do by our own for centered by our own our own abilities it's god when god's hand is in it god is gonna make it all work out right and what a blessing it is when it's when it's your choice and not somebody else's when you're the one that said i want god and not because somebody else said you got to do it do you raise your hand not because somebody said you need to raise your hand or you say say amen not because somebody said you need to say amen but because something on the inside compels you i believe that and i want myself to be identified with that you know i was reading a sermon the other day where brother brown was telling the people in his congregation he was he was testifying about something that happened and he said now i want you to say amen say amen and they said amen and he said the reason i wanted you to say amen was because when people listen to this sermon your voice is going to be a testimony that the things that i said were true and every time you listen to that tape it echoes back so you see when you say amen it's a testimony that the things that are being said are correct that they're accurate that the thing that you agree with what's being said and even as people are listening in online they hear your voice saying amen because you believe that and you you're actually part of the service you're part of the experience because you're responding that you agree with what's being preached what a blessing that god doesn't want puppets in the church he wants you to choose he wants you to be able to respond he don't want you to just be tied by puppet strings so that he can just manipulate you or something it's got to be by your own free will you know even looking through this church we've got technicians and musicians and janitors and cooks and helps and they're all motivated not because somebody said you got to be a musician or you got to be a technician but something motivated them that they wanted to do that and they chose they chose to do that they volunteered to do it i want to be this part because why because it's impossible to love without the ability to choose and if the people even in this church are doing things because they love god not because they're forced but because they love god and that's what power is a christian life is love something changed in your heart and you love god that's the way you the reason you dress different that's the reason you don't drink alcohol and things like the world because you love god something in your heart has been changed god is a gentleman he'll never force you he won't force you but you know we got a purpose in our life that we're supposed to be fulfilling and that purpose is to be conformed to the image of god and sometimes we get a little out of line and we forget what our purpose is we get spiritual amnesia we forget what we're doing here and sometimes god has to pull that hedge of protection back so that we get a little reminder we need god sickness can be a tool that god allows you to bring to bring you to place of decision what to further his purpose now i'm echoing the things that brother branham said this today i'm if you want to go back and do some more studying i'm preaching from the sermons demonology physical realm and spiritual realm this morning this demonology physical realm so god sometimes permits satan these are brother ryan's words god sometimes permits satan to put sickness on you as a whip to bring you back to the house of god when you disobey him you think about that time again when billy paul was laying there he laying there in the hospital bread and he began to cry out for his daddy and his daddy said you do the you do that you did the sin and you do the praying cause because that was a tool that god was using a tool that god was using to bring him back to a place where he knew he needed god god permits trouble why so we'll get help you know even in your natural life when you get in trouble what's your first response i need some help when you get when you get stranded on the side of the road with a flat tire i got to get some help i got to call somebody i need some help if you're drowning who you're going to call you're going to look for a lifeguard are you going to call for your relative or something you're not just going to keep drowning if your back hurts you're going to go look for maybe a chiropractor or somebody that can help if your appendix ruptures whoop it's time to call the ambulance go to the emergency room you need some help if you're thirsty what are you gonna do you're gonna run to the kitchen and get you a glass of water you're not just gonna sit up there in your room and say well i'm thirsty i guess this is just the way it is but you're gonna run for that glass of water if you're hungry what are you gonna do you're gonna go run down to the kitchen and get you or the corner grocery store or the gas station and get you a little snack you're not just gonna sit there and stew in your condition but you're gonna go run to get to something something to satisfy that need if you're needy you gotta run to where you can get some help so if you're needed this morning don't sit there in your condition but run to the one who can meet every need and the bible says in philippians 4 19 my god shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory by christ jesus in matthew 6 8 it says your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him and psalm 23 it says the lord is my shepherd i shall not want the lord is my shepherd so we've got somebody that will satisfy every need that knows what your need is this morning and that's got a purpose in your life so that everything in your life works according to that purpose so that that purpose can be fulfilled god knows what you need this morning in matthew 6 8 it says your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him in matthew chapter 6 verse 25 it says therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not knew that neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are you not much better than they and in jeremiah chapter 29 it says for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you and expect it in then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart so why do we get sick sometimes god wants your heart why do we go through trouble sometimes god wants your heart so if you're if you're sick and needy this morning if you're tormented by by something in your spirit where where you know you know that something's wrong in your life and you need something step one step one is make sure you're right with god make sure you're right your purpose is to be conformed to the image of his son so if you're out of step first step is is get along with god and say god i'm sorry for all the things i've done go go around to all the people that you've wronged and make things right with them to make sure there's no stone unturned if you stole from somebody if you took money from somebody if you've done something wrong with them go around and go around to every one of them and say i'm sorry even if you think that there's nothing that you did if there's anything in your mind that's preventing you from having peace it's time to go make everything right so that you're conformed to the image of his son because every if there's some kind of tormenting spirit on your tormenting tormenting devil that's messing around with your spirit that's giving you grief in your body the devil won't move until you make everything right now brother emma said in the deep calleth to the deep he said if there's unconfessed sin or something or some out of the will of god you could anoint them all night long and cry and scream and do all you wish to that demon will stay right there you see how many times some people sometimes will come up to the altar and get the ministry to pray for us and cry over us and there's a great big commotion made and yet that the devil will stay right there tore him in all day long tormenting all night long because there's something still left undone in your life he said that's right he has a right to well that's what you have to watch god has put a curse on somebody for something then you come along and take it off you get in trouble like moses did that's right he's here the holy spirit now and brother i'm saying it sees see if there's unconfessed sin or something the devil's got a right to stay right there until you get your heart right with god because god wants your heart he wants your heart he wants you to give your heart to him are we willing to make things right will you give your heart to the lord will you make all wrongs right will you apologize to anybody that's necessary will you lay aside all your pride and stubbornness and admit if you're wrong will you repay the things you stole will you set straight and mend the things the wrongs you've committed well you ask forgiveness to god and man see sickness sometimes makes things serious the tor when the tormentor comes it makes things serious so let's get serious about god serious about god because god sometimes he'll permit death or sickness because of disobedience you got a soul that god is after i'm running out of time i'm not used to just having an hour in the morning you you got a soul that god is after and that soul gives you the ability to choose this morning that's what separates you from an animal that you're not just like a chimpanzee or something that you're not you're not an animal you've got you've got something down on the inside that guides your life that guides your direction and and gives you it gives you the ability to choose god every man and a woman in earth has a soul a man in a bar has a soul every murder in prison has a soul the homeless person filling the subway car with with us a foul stench as i've i've been acquainted with as i drove road to atlanta and sometimes they got a soul you sometimes you look at somebody that's in a different situation in life and you think well there's something different no that person has a soul and brother said when he would go into africa and look at the people eating maggots and look at the way they lived he said they've got just as right much right to hear the gospel as you or i do because you've got a soul and an animal doesn't have a soul they've got something that kind of kind of they they can kind of go get water and do some little tricks and things but they don't have nothing to think with they don't have nothing to choose with you remember that that gorilla that they talk sign language to and i remember that was in the news where they they taught it sign language and they asked it one time it could like say some little things and and respond to questions and they said what they asked it what about god and they said i don't know nothing about god because the soul is how you respond to god that little animal he didn't know it didn't have a way to answer back it just it just has a way to you know you can put glasses on and and put a little hat on take it off and ride around on a unicycle or something like that but you've got a soul on the inside that gives you a way to respond and brother adam said those people in africa eat maggots and and whatnot he said let him hear it one time and watch him scream and run to the altar real quick because he's got a soul a deep cause to the deep something to respond to that call from god you've got a soul and can and can choose life so god is looking for a soul that will respond a soul he's looking for fertile ground that will accept his word and once that seed is planted in the heart it's a grain of wheat from then on once you're born again you're a christian until you leave this world once you've heard that word and received that word you're a christian from then on you say well you because you got that earnest you've got the earnest the the down payment has been paid and the earnest what is the earnest the baptism of the holy ghost is the proof the earnest is the proof that the rest will be paid you've got the proof that god is a healer the proof that god is a deliverer the proof that god still saves the proof that god is not a respecter of purpose the holy ghost is that proof the holy ghost is the life the holy ghost is the witness the holy ghost is the abstract title deed so how could somebody that's got all that how could they how could they get sick how could they get sick you know you got a life down on the inside when you get born again what what what is something like cancer something like cancer is a is a life of something else something down on the inside of that thing that that cancerous life it begins to it begins to to form in in a backslidden sale and and brother brown begins to talk about how cancer it usually comes from a bruise a bruise that strikes and the cells break what is a bruise now a bruise is a you got a little sale and it's got a purpose in your in life the purpose is for to to to help you do the things to fight off germs to fight infection and every cell in your body has a purpose and it gets bruised maybe it gets injured maybe like like somebody's sitting in church sometimes and somebody says something a little bit wrong and they get bruised and they draw up and they begin to think well maybe i just need to sit at home maybe i just don't need to come to church anymore maybe they begin to think forget their purpose and see that when when someone a bruise happens that's right when that devil can begin to work and the bruise that that the the life of satan begins to enter into that bruised cell and it start begins to turn cancerous it's bruised because something happened to it he said a cancer comes from a bruise a bruised cell usually is where it comes from all mashed up the cell is backslidden if something happens in there that fails to get the function of blood to it right that fails to get the blood working right and cancer begins to happen and that life is that life so now you've got two things that the life of that cancer and the life of god worn out and then life the life of god you know can cast out that cancer he said a life another life not your life a germ comes in there it's a spirit first that develops around it by germ or takes the germ that's already in your body and takes its place and satan can't create so he begins to build sales growth it begins to build on that life of that way on the inside is that life and then cells begin to build around that life a cataract does the same thing it gets bigger and what's it doing your little germ is to make you live that germ is to suck the blood from you to kill you and you get that cancer a cancer a big old massive confusion growing and growing and and going through your body and going like a spider web going everywhere because the problem if we get down to the problem the root cause the problem is there's a foreign life in there there's another life in there another life he said it's another life different from your life living in you and it's tormenting sapping your life that's the reason jesus called it a devil the devil's got one duty to do and that's take your life to cut your days short of three score and ten but you know doctors a lot of times they can patch things up and cut things out and everything but but the only one that can kick the life out is the life of god that's why this morning we still believe in healing we still believe it in the power of god no matter what what is afflicting you this morning whether it's cancer or tuberculosis or a lung issue or whatever or mind battles that god is still able to heal and deliver doctors in medicine can't heal they can patch things up and let and and the light let the life of god begin to close the wombs and things but we've got a god on the scene that we've got access to all these benefits of healing like in psalms 103 that we read who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases and in exodus chapter 15 for i am the lord that healeth thee and in isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed so what what is divine healing divine healing is dealing with that life when you come with faith that believing that god is able to cast that life out to get the life of the devil out that's why in sanctification the unclean spirit goes out because you're being healed the unclean spirit is cast out what is divine healing it was when that that foreign life is extracted that foreign life is called out and the way the way that jesus did it when he would he would just say go when he when that when that devil came when they were you know all the devils in legion they were wanting to go into the swine and he didn't pray a big long fervent prayer or anything he just said one word go why because the devil's recognized what do they recognize in life the devil ain't recognizing all the intellectual understanding and and somebody that's trying to fake it but they'll recognize life jesus said in luke chapter four when jesus rebuked him legion saying he said hold thy peace and come out of him he just spoke the words come out of him when the life is cast out the battle is over and how is the life cast out through the preaching of the word through the preaching of the gospel cast out that life what is it slow and steady wins the race when the when the life is cast out that that thing begins to bloat and you begin to wonder with something happening that that life is cast out of that cancer on the inside and it begins to bloat and begins to rot and die you begin to think something's wrong but slow and steady is what wins the race because you just believe that god is moving something's beginning to work and and don't don't get uh let your faith be faltered when when you begin to be healed and and you you're you know that thing begins to that that that carcass on the inside begins to rot you just stay right with it stay right with what god wants you to believe brother adam said don't you disbelieve stay right with it mean it from your heart say no sir i'll not be moved no matter how sick i get that doesn't have nothing to do with it then the first thing you know you'll be getting cleared up everything will be all right then see it's dead the operation that the doctor would have taken from you that same growth is laying in you with no life in it when it's cast out by divine healing he said the gift of divine healing was in you if you got healed it's you the one any gift operates by faith and no matter how much gift of divine healing i got i believe it with all my heart but you could stand here and if you haven't got the same kind of faith it don't do you no good what is that the choice to believe the choice that you have because you have a soul to believe to believe god's word he said i could pray for you for hours and weeks and months and isn't the preachers with the divine healing it's you that's got the gift of divine healing that believes in being healed because it's by faith by faith every operation of god is by faith everything we have is by faith this morning so when you get it real down in a place of despondency do like abraham and let your faith grow as every day walked by when he didn't have that child every year and people were saying well where's the child at his faith began to grow moses when he got to the red sea his faith began to grow because of all the things that he'd seen and dave daniel's faith got stronger and stronger the longer that they were in babylon when you get into a particular predicament let your faith grow the worse it gets the more of a miracle it's going to be no matter how bad it looks yet we still have a promise don't forget all the benefits that you have as a believer forget not all your benefits don't let your soul be troubled because we've got benefits as christians and those benefits that oh that the devil has the devil can have no preeminence in your life if you'll just take god at his word and give god your heart turn your heart to god and if you're at a place where if you're in a place where the devil's just running rough shot over your life and tormenting your spirit figure out what it's going to take if you have to go around to everybody and say ask for forgiveness because we've we've got benefits that's why mark chapter 11 says therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them why because we come with faith believing we've got we've come with faith everything is by faith believing that god is able and brother adam said what's going to happen now if you accept christ as your healer and believe in your heart that something has happened to you and you believe you're healed are you going to believe that you're healed he said don't let the devil pin nothing else on you just keep on doctors say doctor how does it look he said why is still there and the musicians can go ahead and come and your heart you know you know what's happened first thing he will say say wonder what happened to that thing then say look doctor i'm going to tell you here's what happened faith took hold jesus christ healed me that's right jesus christ heal me that's what he said you're going to be able to tell the doctor when something something began to happen don't have any more doubt he said we understand where it comes from now we know it's a devil and we know when he leaves he has to come and command of god he has to god's done said so he has to leave this morning i believe as we stand to our feet i believe that we've got an answer we've got the benefits we've got that's what the holy ghost was sent to take away all this torment that the devil you've got the answer of healing this morning you've got the answer of salvation you've got the answer of an overcoming life of this morning if if there's something in your life well you're not settled and something's out of cater in your life we've got the answer this morning i wonder this morning if you just lift up your hands if this morning you have a need from god and maybe you maybe you need a refilling this morning maybe this morning you just need more revelation we've got an answer for whatever your need is this morning maybe this morning you don't know him in the power of his resurrection maybe you don't know him like you should he wants to know you i wonder this morning if you would be willing to give all of your heart to him he wants your heart he wants everything that you have he wants to be the lord of your life if you just lift your hand to him and say i pledge my life a new to him i pledge my my being i want to be settled this morning i'm done with all the torment in my life i'm done with the run and i'm done i want god lord jesus you see all the hands raised lord god and lord my hand is raised lord jesus because i don't
