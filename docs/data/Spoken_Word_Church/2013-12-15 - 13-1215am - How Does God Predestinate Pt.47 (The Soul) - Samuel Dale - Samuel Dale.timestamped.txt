[2:50] let your grace and love be with each one
[2:52] in Jesus name
[2:54] amen
[2:56] okay Romans 8.
[3:00] maybe the Lord willing next weekend we
[3:02] might get around to talking about
[3:04] predestination more a little more I hope
[3:07] this is coming into view on it to help
[3:09] you but you know not just getting right
[3:12] on the point of this that or the other
[3:14] okay Romans
[3:16] 8 28 and we know that all things work
[3:19] together for good to them that love God
[3:20] to them who are the called according to
[3:22] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[3:25] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[3:28] the image of his son that he might be
[3:31] the firstborn among many brethren
[3:33] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[3:35] he also called and whom he called then
[3:37] he also justified in whom he justified
[3:39] them he also glorified
[3:41] what shall we
[3:44] shall we then say to these things if God
[3:46] be for us
[3:48] who can be against us that's a great
[3:50] point isn't it just one scripture
[3:54] in Ezekiel
[3:55] we'll just read one scripture verse 4.
[4:00] Ezekiel 18 4 behold All Souls are mine
[4:05] as the soul of the father so also the
[4:07] soul of the son is mine
[4:09] the Soul at sinneth it shall die you may
[4:13] be seated the Lord had his Blessing to
[4:15] the reading of the word
[4:19] now
[4:21] we've tried to uh
[4:25] get a little
[4:27] too tired on the back of my neck right
[4:30] we tried to bring out you know a lot
[4:32] this especially this past
[4:35] Wednesday night that I hope you
[4:37] enjoyed
[4:39] and uh pray that you'll listen to it if
[4:42] you haven't heard it because we we tried
[4:45] to express some points on it and I want
[4:46] to back up into that just a little bit
[4:48] and go on into a point because I was
[4:52] asked back some time ago
[4:54] to uh speak about you know the soul what
[4:59] a solely is and and things like that so
[5:02] we'll try to speak on that today if we
[5:05] can to to bring forth the point and
[5:08] it'll all line up with predestination
[5:11] because of what we're looking at now
[5:14] remember what we just read here
[5:16] he said All Souls are mine
[5:20] all right now Satan cannot create
[5:26] so no matter what
[5:30] who
[5:32] whatever every person come from God by
[5:36] the point of him creating
[5:40] bringing into being the soul of that
[5:43] individual because Satan cannot
[5:46] give your soul that was where I differed
[5:49] with the the two Soul people many years
[5:51] ago that they said well God give your
[5:54] soul Satan give your soul let make him a
[5:56] Creator so I couldn't go along with it
[5:57] it was just a point that I couldn't do
[6:00] but you know you get a lot of things
[6:03] involved in it and we'll try to get down
[6:05] to it in a minute but I want you to
[6:07] think about what I was saying Wednesday
[6:08] night I want to make sure the point got
[6:11] across good
[6:12] God I don't want you to miss
[6:14] you know misunderstand me
[6:18] and in doing it then we'll we'll just
[6:20] read a couple of quotes that we read
[6:22] there
[6:22] uh Wednesday night go ahead and pull up
[6:26] number one brother
[6:27] and uh
[6:29] this is taken from adoption number three
[6:31] paragraph
[6:32] 177 and 178 reached in
[6:36] 1965-22 in the the morning service now
[6:41] think about it
[6:44] Jesus never died
[6:49] to give you an inheritance
[6:52] right does everybody understand that I
[6:55] wanted to make sure because I know
[6:57] that's a blunt statement compared to
[7:00] what most people think
[7:02] because most people you know most people
[7:03] think well Jesus done this well that's
[7:06] right
[7:08] but it's got to be in the right way
[7:10] if it's not then you're messing up so
[7:12] look what he says
[7:14] inheritance by predestination
[7:17] now that would be enough to stay there a
[7:18] long time I said I ain't heard it's
[7:21] something what inheritance there had to
[7:23] be somebody to leave me an inheritance
[7:25] when you say Jesus left me an
[7:27] inheritance
[7:28] beg your pardon
[7:30] Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus
[7:33] never left you an inheritance
[7:36] he only came down and paid the price
[7:40] paid for your inheritance
[7:43] done what brought you to your
[7:45] inheritance
[7:46] which your name was put on a lounge book
[7:48] of life before the foundation World God
[7:50] give you your inheritance your
[7:53] inheritance was first
[7:56] the
[7:58] inheritance
[8:01] and Jesus never left me one
[8:05] you say well well I don't understand how
[8:08] that that is because I I thought he he
[8:12] did
[8:13] well see that's where we're looking at
[8:15] it in the wrong direction
[8:18] because
[8:20] Jesus the flesh
[8:24] was a man
[8:28] right
[8:31] his body was created
[8:34] it was perfect
[8:35] but it was not eternal
[8:38] all right see then you were tying up to
[8:40] the point of saying Jesus
[8:42] done something now what did he do
[8:46] that's what I was trying to get across
[8:47] Wednesday night
[8:50] that human body
[8:53] the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness
[8:55] of the godhead bodily
[8:57] that human body died
[9:02] but God Spirit soul but he can't die
[9:06] so what did he do
[9:09] the product of death was made
[9:12] the Hebrews 10 if I'm a body that has
[9:14] prepared me
[9:16] and that body was not eternal
[9:19] it had to be made eternal all right
[9:22] and see then in that flesh
[9:25] lived the life of almighty God that's
[9:28] why we're not Trinity and we're not
[9:30] Oneness
[9:32] all right
[9:34] but we're in the scriptures of what it's
[9:36] saying
[9:37] all right
[9:39] he gave his soul a ransom as we'll get
[9:42] to it in a little while
[9:45] so that you and I could have eternal
[9:48] life
[9:50] now remember when we were talking about
[9:51] it that God didn't step in heaven he
[9:53] come down to live with us
[9:55] and he came on down until God lived in a
[9:58] human vessel
[10:01] and that human vessel was a creation
[10:04] perfect beautiful right but not Eternal
[10:07] because you can't create something
[10:09] eternal
[10:10] all right
[10:11] then in doing that when he died
[10:15] what happened he released
[10:19] the life that was within him
[10:23] so he come down to pay the price
[10:26] the body paid the price right
[10:30] that's right the body died it paid the
[10:32] price
[10:33] that was our Kinsmen
[10:35] that's our brother
[10:37] all right
[10:39] but see he couldn't give us it wasn't
[10:42] that Jesus was another person
[10:45] see if you're thinking that Jesus gave
[10:47] you
[10:49] or left you an inheritance then you're
[10:51] making him another person separate from
[10:53] God
[10:55] and that won't work
[10:57] he was almighty God in human flesh
[11:00] all right
[11:01] the body of the spirit was almighty God
[11:04] the flesh was a creation
[11:05] all right
[11:07] and then as the prophet said it then
[11:09] what
[11:11] he said Jesus never left me an
[11:13] inheritance
[11:14] he only came down and paid for your
[11:16] inheritance
[11:18] brought you to your inheritance
[11:25] he paid for you in there he brought you
[11:27] to your inheritance
[11:30] and what's what he's saying
[11:32] God buys foreknowledge seen exactly he
[11:35] would be saved and who wouldn't be saved
[11:37] He sent Jesus to save those that had
[11:40] already he had already chosen did Paul
[11:43] say five verses above the heart he
[11:45] showed us in him
[11:46] before there even was a world that's our
[11:49] inheritance
[11:50] God chose us and let Jesus come and pay
[11:55] the price
[11:56] the what the shedding of his blood that
[12:00] no sin would be accounted to us nothing
[12:02] you do
[12:04] he paid the price
[12:07] by dying
[12:10] by giving his own life
[12:13] the life that was within him is he
[12:16] coming out of the body the body died
[12:20] had it not been raised back up
[12:24] it would have totally rotten
[12:26] why because it was a human element
[12:30] but he doesn't said he wouldn't do it he
[12:32] wouldn't let him see corruption
[12:34] but he wouldn't leave his soul in Hell
[12:35] either so
[12:36] all right
[12:38] so who was that man that we talk about
[12:41] body
[12:42] a man
[12:44] spirit and soul was almighty God
[12:48] all right that's why it's Emmanuel God
[12:51] With Us all right so what did he do he
[12:55] paid the price
[12:58] he came down and died in flesh that you
[13:02] and I could have eternal life that was
[13:04] the only way
[13:08] as the people talk today I see I always
[13:10] was eternal well then you didn't need
[13:12] Jesus to die
[13:16] that's what I tried to tell them two
[13:17] Soul people years ago
[13:19] they said well all you had to do was
[13:20] just kill that old soul it's because you
[13:23] didn't need nothing on the other there's
[13:24] always Eternal I said okay all we got to
[13:27] do is knock him in the head we'll feel
[13:29] Heaven up
[13:31] you said that's being sarcastic now
[13:33] that's being truthful
[13:36] I could do it at Church of Christ man I
[13:38] said you mean water baptism is under
[13:40] regeneration yes I said I'll meet you on
[13:43] Lake Lanier
[13:46] we'll just put them all in the water
[13:49] if that's all it is
[13:52] but you said oh no brother brother you
[13:54] don't know you know I know
[13:58] see I know that I'm an arrogant hateful
[14:01] old dude but I try to stay with the
[14:03] truth
[14:05] and believe it
[14:07] and see then by making statements people
[14:09] don't like me well that's all right I
[14:10] don't like you either
[14:13] but in God I love you or I wouldn't
[14:15] still be preaching
[14:17] all right
[14:18] but now you see what I'm talking about
[14:22] He sent Jesus to
[14:26] it wasn't God's sin in Jesus that's like
[14:29] another son that's like we know better
[14:31] than that he didn't send a son he came
[14:32] himself
[14:34] but yet in terminology as we speak God
[14:37] sent the son
[14:39] that's like two different people
[14:42] now he came himself
[14:47] that's right he released that life that
[14:48] was within there
[14:49] but did you catch what I was just saying
[14:51] it to lies that's that's the main point
[14:53] I want you to see
[14:55] look at the one that we read on
[14:57] paragraph 56 Gable's instructions to
[14:59] Daniel
[15:00] 1961 7 30 in the morning service number
[15:04] two of you
[15:05] of your notes brother
[15:08] did you understand what he's saying
[15:12] and we found that he was our kinsman
[15:13] redeemer he took the book out of the
[15:16] hand of the original owner it's a title
[15:18] deed to Redemption we found that
[15:20] remember the study is the title deed of
[15:23] redemption it's an abstract deed with it
[15:25] that God required life for death in the
[15:28] Garden of Eden now what happened in the
[15:29] Garden of Eden
[15:31] they sinned they died he required life
[15:33] he took the life of the animals right
[15:35] okay are you with it
[15:38] then Jesus the righteous one died
[15:42] and took a title deed and was able to
[15:45] break the seals
[15:47] reveal what was into him and give the
[15:50] inheritance that belonged to him
[15:54] to his people
[15:57] The Inheritance belonged to him
[16:00] he was the only way you and I could ever
[16:03] have an inheritance
[16:05] right
[16:07] there is no inheritance outside of Jesus
[16:09] Christ paying the price okay now so
[16:12] what'd he do
[16:15] he gave he give the inheritance that
[16:18] belonged to his people
[16:20] eternal life that he inherited by doing
[16:22] that
[16:28] no
[16:31] we know the Eternal God had eternal life
[16:35] or was eternal life not had
[16:40] but the body was not eternal
[16:43] You Realize by releasing like I said
[16:45] Wednesday by him releasing that life out
[16:48] of him
[16:52] the body then
[16:56] was made Eternal in the resurrection
[16:58] right
[16:59] so he inherited eternal life
[17:03] what God inherited eternal life
[17:08] the flesh man inherited eternal life
[17:15] I just wanted to make sure you
[17:17] understood that
[17:19] because you can say well boy I'll tell
[17:20] you what
[17:21] you know like what now he said what's
[17:24] your Prophet is saying
[17:27] eternal life that he inherited by doing
[17:29] that
[17:31] he inherited eternal life his body was
[17:34] made eternal
[17:37] because he released that life out of
[17:39] that body
[17:40] now if he'd stayed with that life in
[17:42] that body
[17:44] his body would have never been eternal
[17:47] come on
[17:49] look
[17:50] then what'd he do he passed his own life
[17:52] back out at Calvary
[17:54] and divided it Among Us by the Holy
[17:56] Ghost amen no man has never been able to
[17:58] come to ever think of the love that was
[18:02] see he passed his own life back
[18:06] he released it
[18:09] all right and once he released it
[18:13] see then it gave him the inheritance of
[18:16] eternal life and flesh
[18:19] all right your prophet's right
[18:21] he just takes a revelation to understand
[18:26] what is being said
[18:29] you see he
[18:31] inheritance
[18:35] eternal life that he had inherited by
[18:37] doing it look at the next one I didn't
[18:38] give this Wednesday I just found this
[18:41] when it's look at number three which is
[18:44] paragraph 161 of the Revelation chapter
[18:48] 5 61 6 18.
[18:55] he breaks the seals reveals gives us
[18:58] he is what reveals gives us his
[19:03] inheritance to the people
[19:06] now he gave
[19:09] us eternal life right
[19:12] he made the way for us here but you know
[19:14] what
[19:16] by coming and living in this flesh
[19:20] he's going to give us the eternal life
[19:22] that he inherited in flesh
[19:25] right
[19:27] that's right it's all right now what is
[19:29] it
[19:30] he gives inheritance that he inherited
[19:37] becoming kinsman redeemer
[19:40] all right and freely gives it out to us
[19:43] it all belonged to him he was the one
[19:46] who redeemed but instead of keeping it
[19:48] himself he gives it back to the people
[19:50] that's his love for us
[19:52] right
[19:53] what do you understand
[19:56] he inherited
[19:58] eternal life and flesh by releasing the
[20:01] life out of his flesh
[20:05] all right then he comes and lives in you
[20:07] and I
[20:10] in the new birth
[20:12] lays claim on our body
[20:16] right
[20:19] no that's why we don't believe in
[20:21] getting a new body
[20:22] Jesus didn't have a new body he raised
[20:25] with nail prints in his hands
[20:31] see if this body then made eternal
[20:35] from the inside
[20:37] which is the holy spirit living in us
[20:39] and that's completing the Plan of
[20:42] Redemption as we're reading our
[20:43] Wednesday
[20:45] the earnest of our inheritance what
[20:48] until the Redemption of the purchase
[20:50] possessed it's already purchased
[20:53] right but it hasn't been applied
[20:55] Israel's salvation has already been
[20:58] purchased right but it hasn't been
[21:01] applied to them
[21:03] your inheritance my inheritance of
[21:06] eternal life and flesh has done been
[21:08] purchased
[21:10] and when he gave you the Holy Ghost he
[21:12] laid claim on that
[21:15] all right
[21:18] see then that would give us eternal life
[21:20] all right
[21:22] brother Brown said on the message I
[21:24] didn't give them this one now on the
[21:25] message the faith of Abraham 1955 he
[21:29] said
[21:30] you got every Redemption blessing Jesus
[21:36] died for as your personal property
[21:41] all the Redemption blessings Jesus died
[21:46] for is our own property
[21:50] rule death is mine
[21:53] not my enemy
[21:58] you can't do anything to me
[22:00] you can't take his my life until God's
[22:02] true with me
[22:03] so why do I worry all right
[22:07] but see we went through the fact of
[22:09] saying that when we're born again
[22:13] we receive the earnest of our
[22:15] inheritance according to the scripture
[22:18] which is a new birth right
[22:21] all right until the Redemption of the
[22:24] purchased possession
[22:26] then see that's this body
[22:30] totally redeemed but then the world will
[22:32] be redeemed why because he's already
[22:34] taken us out of this world
[22:36] now remember the point I was trying to
[22:38] say
[22:39] the Rich Young Ruler
[22:42] he said I've done all of these things
[22:46] from my youth
[22:50] Jesus said
[22:53] give all you got
[22:55] that's what we put it on give it all
[22:56] away
[22:58] but then what'd he say
[22:59] he said come follow me
[23:02] right
[23:03] which is giving away all this money was
[23:05] going to be the concern no that just
[23:07] wound up showing that the man was too
[23:09] too stingy too tight to this that's the
[23:11] other and wasn't going to give it up
[23:14] but he didn't go follow him right
[23:18] where did he want him to follow him too
[23:22] you remember that Matthew 19.
[23:24] and not Matthew 19 28-29 follow me in
[23:28] the Regeneration
[23:31] and you'll inherit everlasting life
[23:37] so he told a Rich Young Ruler what it
[23:39] would take
[23:40] to come and follow him
[23:43] he knew right then he could not give him
[23:46] the eternal life that he had within him
[23:50] right
[23:52] there was no way to get because the
[23:54] Bible said the Holy Ghost did not been
[23:56] given because Jesus not been glorified
[23:59] all right so he had to die so he told a
[24:01] Rich Young Ruler follow me
[24:06] all right
[24:08] come and go with me and walk right into
[24:11] the Regeneration
[24:16] the new birth
[24:18] which is what came on a day of Pentecost
[24:20] right
[24:21] all right showed on the damn Pentecost
[24:23] he gave back
[24:27] the life
[24:28] the prophet said what
[24:31] he said he sent his soul back
[24:34] in the form of the baptism of the Holy
[24:36] Ghost
[24:37] well I thought it was just a spirit that
[24:39] came
[24:41] well then you're just an anointed one
[24:46] good anointing ones out of the
[24:48] eternal spirit of God on them
[24:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost your
[24:52] Prophet says
[24:54] genuine
[24:56] you can have that on your spirit and die
[24:58] and go to hell
[25:01] so as we enter the thought of what we're
[25:03] talking about
[25:07] remember
[25:09] the soul is the most important part of
[25:12] you
[25:19] your body's not important
[25:23] Spirit that's within you is not the most
[25:26] important thing because it can be
[25:28] Anointed with the spirit
[25:30] I don't mean you're saved
[25:34] but if you have that eternal life in
[25:36] your soul
[25:38] all right
[25:40] and so watch what we're getting at
[25:45] Jesus told them he said come and follow
[25:48] me
[25:50] now watch the point I wrote down to
[25:52] start the service today
[25:56] we uh Baptist
[25:59] we used to talk about
[26:01] you know one of these days we're going
[26:02] to get up to heaven
[26:04] I think I'm saved I believe I'm saved I
[26:07] hope I'm safe
[26:08] I you know I believe I have eternal life
[26:12] but I'm going to get eternal life when I
[26:13] get to heaven
[26:21] what I like about it is one thing
[26:25] is being a member of the Bride of Jesus
[26:27] Christ
[26:30] now listen
[26:31] You Realize by being a member of the
[26:33] Bride of Jesus Christ that you and I
[26:36] receive our full inheritance
[26:39] while we're here on Earth
[26:42] nobody else
[26:45] gets that
[26:50] the Bride of Jesus Christ receives
[26:53] Body Spirit and soul
[26:56] eternal
[26:58] well we're right here
[27:01] you say well what's the difference in
[27:03] eternal life to a foolish virgin and
[27:04] eternal life we have that's the
[27:06] difference
[27:09] Even Adam was just imparted to him
[27:12] eternal life
[27:14] but Jesus it wasn't imparted to him
[27:18] he was eternal life
[27:20] all right
[27:22] and see then it's not just an imparting
[27:24] to you and I it's a process we have to
[27:27] go through
[27:29] which is justification jumping off the
[27:32] piscience sanctification cleansing and
[27:35] setting aside and then the baptism of
[27:37] the Holy Ghost which is a new birth
[27:40] the soul of God to come and live in you
[27:42] and I
[27:45] now the soul of man is the most
[27:48] important part about him
[27:51] go ahead and pull that up brother from
[27:53] there
[27:54] the first one I gave you
[27:58] did you see what the Greek and the
[28:00] Hebrew says about the soul
[28:01] and while they're doing that Webster
[28:03] says soul
[28:05] is a human being
[28:08] a person
[28:10] it can mean Spirit or we'll read in a
[28:12] minute because it's interchangeable so
[28:16] it's an essence
[28:18] it's the core of anything
[28:20] it's the heart amen of anything
[28:25] the the core or heart of a peach
[28:29] is not dead center in the peach it may
[28:31] be off a little bit but it's the seed
[28:34] right
[28:36] the heart of it all right
[28:40] the Greek which is the New Testament
[28:43] it says that the word soul is
[28:47] life mind heart
[28:50] ILY
[28:52] it means breath
[28:54] you remember
[28:56] you breathed into Adam's nostrils and he
[28:57] became a what
[28:59] Living spirit well no no that wasn't
[29:02] what it said it says the living soul
[29:08] God it means breath means the Breath of
[29:11] Life
[29:12] the vital force which animates the body
[29:14] and shows itself in breathing
[29:17] of animals of man you remember they're
[29:20] giving the definition all the way
[29:22] they're not dividing it to see them the
[29:24] animal don't have a soul they're just
[29:26] giving a definition because you'll see
[29:28] in a minute that the word where I hear
[29:30] it is the New Testament usually soul in
[29:32] spirit interchangeably
[29:35] because it will have the same meaning if
[29:38] you use it it's just like saying
[29:42] eternal life
[29:44] and then say an everlasting life
[29:48] well everlasting's got a point it
[29:50] started and then
[29:51] not when you're referring to the life of
[29:54] God
[29:56] so in the scripture when it's speaking
[29:58] of everlasting life
[30:02] he's talking about eternal life
[30:05] so if you're reading and it says Soul it
[30:07] says spirit
[30:10] don't worry about it
[30:12] just get what you're talking about
[30:16] Jesus said my soul is troubled
[30:20] into thy hand I commend my spirit
[30:23] those words can be interchangeable
[30:26] right
[30:27] but look
[30:30] he says the the human nature
[30:33] is the point
[30:34] that in which there is life a living
[30:37] being a living soul the soul the seed of
[30:40] the feelings Desires affections
[30:42] aversions in other words human soul as
[30:45] far as constituted by the rights use of
[30:48] the AIDS offered it by God can attain
[30:51] its highest end and secure Eternal
[30:53] blessing the soul regarded as a moral
[30:56] being designed for everlasting life
[30:59] the soul as an Essence which differs
[31:02] from the body and is not dissolved by
[31:05] death distinguishing from the other
[31:07] parts of the body
[31:09] yeah
[31:11] because as I said the other day and I
[31:13] got a quote letting on my desk at home
[31:14] if you didn't believe it was right you
[31:17] wrote around says you can kill a person
[31:19] but you can't kill them he said it puts
[31:21] them in another dimension
[31:24] see we think death is to find out now it
[31:26] just moves you to another dimension well
[31:28] because that's the soul that's right we
[31:30] want to get to today look at what the
[31:32] Old Testament says about him
[31:36] it says that the word Soul itself life
[31:38] creature person appetite mind living
[31:41] being desire emotion a passion that
[31:44] which breeds the the breathing substance
[31:48] being troll inner being of man living
[31:51] being living being with its life in the
[31:54] blood the man himself self-person
[31:56] individual seed of even your appetite
[31:59] seed of emotions and Passions
[32:01] activity of mind
[32:04] activity of will
[32:08] what is a soul it's you
[32:12] all right now if you don't get the whole
[32:14] message part you miss it just remember
[32:16] the Bible says the soul that sent us we
[32:19] read
[32:21] it shall die there's no scripture said
[32:23] the spirit that Sinners shall die
[32:28] you don't have that it says the soul
[32:30] that's sinneth
[32:31] it shall die
[32:33] all right
[32:34] and remember in Ezekiel as we read to
[32:37] make sure you hold a point it said oh
[32:39] soldier of mine sold to the father soul
[32:41] to the son all sold your mind he said
[32:46] that's why you can get to understanding
[32:48] it right around and said that he said
[32:51] I've gotten a man from the Lord he said
[32:52] it don't make no difference who Mom and
[32:54] Daddy is my mama and daddy don't give
[32:58] you nothing but a body
[33:02] right
[33:03] it don't give your spirit it don't give
[33:05] you a soul
[33:07] well I'm just like my mom and daddy
[33:11] well you don't have to be
[33:15] you can do something about it
[33:17] why because you're a living Soul you're
[33:20] not your mom and daddy reincarnated
[33:24] or what's that other word they're using
[33:26] now where they were trying to make a a
[33:28] double out of you what is it
[33:30] cologne
[33:32] you're not a cologne
[33:35] you might need some cologne but you're
[33:37] not a cologne
[33:40] but listen
[33:43] we then get the point we here
[33:48] receive our full inheritance
[33:51] which is sonship
[33:54] while we're alive
[33:58] because one of these days even if you're
[34:00] dead you're going to the Grave your
[34:02] body's in the grave sold under the altar
[34:04] Spirit goes back to God whatever you
[34:06] want to do with those terminologies
[34:10] but one day that spirit will be released
[34:12] and come to the soul soul to the body
[34:13] and you'll stand up
[34:15] so we get it all right here the dead
[34:17] will be raised right here it won't be
[34:19] when we get over there they raise and go
[34:21] no we're going to all go together right
[34:25] right and have a body like unto his
[34:27] glorious body the Bible says because
[34:29] we'll be like you
[34:31] why because we're his offspring
[34:33] all right
[34:35] now in doing that see
[34:39] we start our inheritance by the new
[34:42] birth
[34:45] now if you believe you always was
[34:47] eternal
[34:48] then you don't have a starting of an
[34:50] inheritance
[34:53] you'd have your full inheritance without
[34:55] Jesus
[34:57] and I don't believe that
[35:00] I believe he had to die
[35:03] to release that life
[35:05] and then we have to receive that life
[35:10] or we don't have eternal life
[35:12] you're gonna have to rewrite your Bible
[35:14] you'd be saying to Nicodemus Nicodemus
[35:17] all you got to do is believe
[35:19] like I've always said he believed a
[35:21] pretty good bit
[35:22] he said we know you're a teacher come
[35:24] from God we know all these things
[35:29] right
[35:31] but he couldn't understand
[35:34] when he said you must be born again
[35:36] that's the way it is today people don't
[35:37] they don't want to talk about the new
[35:39] birth
[35:40] there's one of some concept or some
[35:42] thought what wrote down I believe the
[35:44] message
[35:45] shows the devil
[35:48] will be what do you got
[35:51] well he don't believe it like I do I
[35:53] agree with you he believes it more than
[35:55] you do
[35:57] okay
[35:59] no
[36:01] but the wonderful part
[36:05] of being the Bride of Jesus Christ
[36:09] we don't have to wait until we get there
[36:14] right
[36:16] neither do we believe we always was
[36:21] without Jesus Christ in the new birth
[36:25] so then we know the truth and you know
[36:27] the truth it'll set you free
[36:30] all right
[36:33] now
[36:37] what is the soul
[36:43] now before I start I want to
[36:46] explain something that
[36:48] people have been massively confused on
[36:53] a lot of times in the early Ministry
[36:55] brother Branham would explain
[36:56] he would say you are body
[36:59] Soul spirit
[37:03] and in the ending of his ministry he
[37:05] would say your body spirit and soul
[37:10] he said well there's no message to
[37:12] correct all of that
[37:14] you don't have to have a correction
[37:19] because I challenge you to bring me any
[37:21] quote you want to
[37:23] and look at that quote and see what he's
[37:26] saying
[37:28] he gives the body five senses he taste
[37:31] filled smell in here
[37:32] he gives the second realm of man whether
[37:35] he calls it Spirit or soul
[37:39] he gives it five senses memory reason
[37:42] conscious affections Etc
[37:45] he gives us inner sense one
[37:49] is he the faith or doubt you say that's
[37:51] two no it's either Faith or doubt
[37:55] it's one of those
[37:56] it's not hyphen height
[37:58] all right so we're either born again or
[38:00] we're not born again
[38:03] there's no gray area to that point
[38:05] all right so listen to him what is a
[38:08] soul
[38:09] better ran them
[38:11] now
[38:12] as I say it when you're using the word
[38:15] soul
[38:18] just look and see what the senses are
[38:21] because he never he doesn't always say
[38:27] you know and put it as a soul be in the
[38:31] spirit in the early Ministry
[38:36] he doesn't every time you see soul in
[38:38] the early Ministry doesn't mean that
[38:40] it's supposed to be changed the spirit
[38:41] you don't have to do that
[38:44] read what he's saying
[38:47] but remember
[38:49] irregardless of what you think
[38:52] the soul is the real you
[38:56] that's what you are
[38:59] no brother damn I'm Body Spirit and soul
[39:01] amen I'm glad you can think
[39:05] but just remember the body can be
[39:07] annihilated
[39:08] and the spirit will go somewhere else
[39:10] but your soul will live on until
[39:12] Judgment Day or either you will be the
[39:15] bride of Christ
[39:17] right
[39:19] so the soul is the real you
[39:23] okay
[39:24] brother random what is a soul
[39:28] okay
[39:30] so let's just read a little bit go ahead
[39:32] number four
[39:34] the world becoming flesh in the India
[39:36] trip 54 1003 morning
[39:40] so let's get a point now
[39:43] we are a threefold being
[39:46] so Body Spirit
[39:48] now see he doesn't always say
[39:50] old men in the old you know say Body
[39:54] Soul Spirit he doesn't always say that
[39:57] we'll read one in a minute where he goes
[39:59] just like this
[40:02] but to try on being is what he's
[40:04] explaining
[40:06] that you're a what
[40:08] your soul your body your spirit but
[40:11] you're only one because the Triune being
[40:13] is not a trinity of beings
[40:15] it takes that to make you
[40:19] right
[40:21] I think I've got it in here brother Ryan
[40:23] said with anyone left out you are not
[40:26] complete you know if you leave all Soul
[40:28] you leave all spiritually leave off body
[40:30] you're not complete all right that ought
[40:31] to be sensible
[40:33] watch we are threefold being
[40:36] so Body Spirit we know that what this
[40:39] flesh is we realize that's here we know
[40:43] what the spirit is it controls the flesh
[40:46] but what is the soul
[40:50] the soul is the nature
[40:52] of the spirit
[40:54] now
[40:56] the soul is the nature
[40:59] of the spirit
[41:02] now if you put that in
[41:06] to a lot of people's hands today and let
[41:08] them Define that Soul being the nature
[41:11] of the spirit
[41:13] you've got a lot of problems
[41:17] because your two Soul people used to
[41:19] call it they used to quote it this way
[41:20] the soul is just the nature of the
[41:22] spirit I want one quote out of brother
[41:24] Brown's message to say that
[41:29] I want one quote where he says the soul
[41:32] is just the nature of the spirit
[41:37] they added one word just because it's
[41:39] not in there
[41:41] search it I've been searching 40 years I
[41:44] searched it without the computer I
[41:46] certainly been real good to search it
[41:47] with a computer you know
[41:50] so he's not saying the soul is just the
[41:52] nature of the spirit
[41:55] see then that would mean it's nothing
[41:56] it's just a whatever that is well you
[41:59] know
[42:02] it's a bird dog
[42:08] you get what I'm saying
[42:11] but yet people quote that as like
[42:14] you quote the soul is the nature of
[42:16] spirit that quote the soul is just the
[42:17] Nature's fear and swear by it
[42:21] but it's not in there
[42:23] why because you're not making this
[42:24] you're not making the soul
[42:28] as to be real you
[42:31] you're just making it a nature or
[42:33] something
[42:34] all right
[42:36] so we hear you're the devil
[42:37] I got them in here
[42:40] oh here you're the devil you know we
[42:42] hear your God and you don't know which
[42:44] one you are
[42:47] just the nature
[42:53] soul is a person
[42:57] come on how many times we went through
[42:58] that Jesus
[43:02] Soul Spirit theophany of his being the
[43:07] prophet said went to hell to preach the
[43:10] souls in prison
[43:15] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[43:18] he said that angel referred to that as
[43:21] saying
[43:22] Souls under the altar
[43:26] but now brother Dale that can't be
[43:28] because Souls under the dollars fifth
[43:30] sealed you
[43:34] in all of it
[43:39] see we think we're right just because we
[43:41] can make a quote
[43:43] anything you give me somebody try it
[43:46] sometimes anything you give me I'll give
[43:49] you all talk my head a quote seems
[43:50] totally contrary to it
[43:55] we just discussed it this morning
[43:59] we run around them in Revelations
[44:02] in the seal book it's in the seventh
[44:04] seal I'm pretty sure
[44:06] he's talking about revelation 7.
[44:08] he said that's not the bride
[44:12] of 1963.
[44:16] in the church age book he said it was
[44:18] the bride
[44:20] in Christ The Mystery of God's revealed
[44:22] which is actually the seals he said it
[44:23] was the bride in questions and answers
[44:26] from 64 he said it was the bride
[44:34] well which one's right brother Dale he's
[44:36] right both times
[44:39] he's writing both ways he's saying it
[44:42] it's according to what he's saying
[44:45] did you see that's where the holy spirit
[44:46] in a teacher or a person supposed to be
[44:49] able to put that together instead of
[44:50] coming up with mass confusion
[44:53] well I don't know what he means
[45:00] let me ask you a simple question
[45:03] are you mathematically calculating that
[45:05] Revelation 7 is after the Rapture
[45:10] and it is
[45:13] well
[45:14] you see where did I come into trouble
[45:16] with I do too much thinking I guess
[45:19] according to my Bible revelations 10 7.
[45:24] is if after Revelations 4 1.
[45:34] Revelation 18 4 is after
[45:38] Revelations 4 1.
[45:44] Church don't you see
[45:46] that even a human man as brother around
[45:47] him was
[45:49] when they asked him the question of
[45:51] Revelations 5
[45:55] he says that is not the bride
[45:59] he said because she's already gone
[46:04] brother Ned Iverson's one had done it he
[46:06] said brother Brown reads a question over
[46:09] he read the question over and he said
[46:11] I was wrong
[46:13] that is the bride
[46:16] he said she's in heaven
[46:21] Revelation 7 is Israel and
[46:25] the foolish virgins in heaven
[46:30] but it's Israel and the bride and the
[46:33] foolish virgins all in heaven
[46:36] choice of compound meaning
[46:40] Revelation 18 4 come out I heard my
[46:42] peoples talking about Israel physically
[46:44] he's talking about you and I right now
[46:47] coming out of our organizational
[46:49] denominational thoughts
[46:53] you see
[46:54] you know today was people taught I heard
[46:56] of this or heard of the message the man
[46:58] didn't even have a soul until the law
[47:00] came into being you ever heard that
[47:01] doctrine that was a Doctrine
[47:06] the man it read it to me I said
[47:08] well according to my Bible it said he'd
[47:12] breathed into the nostrils of Adam and
[47:13] he become a living soul
[47:16] I wondered about that too
[47:19] but it didn't change his Doctrine
[47:22] he went on teaching and man didn't have
[47:24] a soul until the law came
[47:29] the soul is the real you
[47:32] it's not just a spirit or it's just not
[47:34] real so what is it what is the soul the
[47:38] nature of the spirit
[47:42] all right
[47:47] the prophet says the nature of your soul
[47:50] is it sold in prison if I don't get to
[47:52] it he said the nature of your soul is
[47:54] God
[47:55] if you're born again
[47:58] he said but if not
[48:01] it's the nature of the world
[48:04] all right
[48:05] the nature of your soul
[48:09] so the soul is the nature of the spirit
[48:12] your spirit displays outwardly what's
[48:16] within you amen
[48:20] amen right
[48:24] see in my soul is eternal life
[48:29] and I'm trying my best to give it away
[48:31] right
[48:34] what yeah I'm trying to give it to you
[48:38] because see Jesus gave it to me
[48:40] in the basis he allowed me to be able to
[48:43] receive it
[48:46] he released that life that was within
[48:48] him
[48:50] and it came back on the dead Pentecost I
[48:53] would love to be able to release the
[48:54] life I have in me to be able to give it
[48:56] to you
[49:03] would you be willing to do that
[49:05] Paul said ought to be a Castaway
[49:08] if Israel could be saved would you be
[49:10] willing to do that
[49:11] would you ever be willing to give up
[49:13] your eternal life if you could give it
[49:15] to somebody else
[49:17] now brother Dale ain't going along with
[49:19] her
[49:26] I'm just going to say it and you can do
[49:28] what you want to you don't have the
[49:30] eternal life I have
[49:32] come on because I've been trying my best
[49:34] to give away what I got
[49:36] see I know I can't I know I can't lose
[49:38] it
[49:40] right
[49:41] so I try my best
[49:45] to preach the gospel
[49:47] just like what I was explaining there
[49:50] my Ministry if it's anything has always
[49:53] been to take those things that sound
[49:55] like they're totally contrary
[49:58] one to the other and let the Holy Spirit
[50:01] bring it together
[50:03] and it makes a beautiful picture
[50:10] I was explaining to somebody else the
[50:11] other day about this and asked the
[50:13] person a question
[50:16] about the revelation 7. I said it is uh
[50:20] are you back there in uh Ezekiel or
[50:23] Genesis
[50:25] oh I'm in the New Testament
[50:28] well I know how to do we
[50:33] ain't yours in is it
[50:38] all right so come on sisters when it
[50:40] says in
[50:42] the scripture there are the Old
[50:44] Testaments
[50:46] her not to wear a garment pertains to a
[50:48] man
[50:50] well that's the Old Testament
[50:53] within Hebrews 13 8.
[50:56] is where the Prophet said he failed
[51:00] and that's where we fail
[51:03] you see
[51:06] you see somebody come along and the Holy
[51:08] Spirit can put it together I ain't gonna
[51:10] listen to that I know what it is Souls
[51:12] Nature's fear it's just the nature it's
[51:14] just the nature of the world it's the
[51:15] nature of this the nature of that
[51:19] well the prophet said the nature of your
[51:21] soul
[51:23] is God
[51:25] if you're born again
[51:28] that's quoted that to a man standing in
[51:30] Jeffersonville Indiana one day about his
[51:31] two soul man he said how can a nature
[51:34] have a nature I said go talk to the
[51:36] prophet
[51:39] you want to say
[51:40] I said don't talk to me about it did you
[51:43] happen to Nature tonight you're just a
[51:44] nature
[51:45] see that's the point of people they want
[51:47] to make your soul just the nature of
[51:49] your spirit
[51:52] and it's not just the nature of your
[51:55] spirit it is the nature of your spirit
[52:00] now unless you be a hypocrite and I got
[52:01] one in here after a while we'll get to
[52:03] it
[52:05] where brother Brown said those Pharisees
[52:07] we're Hypocrites you know we call them
[52:10] hypocrites
[52:12] he said be called out of one corner of
[52:14] their mouth they said he was a master
[52:15] and God and said out of the other corner
[52:18] of the mouth they said he was Belgium up
[52:25] from their nature their soul they were
[52:28] speaking
[52:32] right
[52:36] no we don't speak from our mouth do we
[52:39] someone else is talking
[52:41] but just think about it now
[52:43] what is the soul
[52:46] it's the nature of the spirit
[52:50] so you've got a bird dog
[52:53] all right
[52:55] he's got a nature
[52:57] you don't teach him the point
[53:02] right
[53:04] you got a hound dog he don't point
[53:08] he chases
[53:11] right
[53:14] there's two different Natures of the
[53:16] same
[53:17] animal
[53:20] all right just explaining the point
[53:25] we were born
[53:29] into Satan's domain
[53:34] and because of the fall in the garden
[53:39] our soul was doomed when it got here
[53:43] right
[53:44] but now let me go back to explain
[53:46] something
[53:47] when God created that baby
[53:50] that baby's the soul was perfect
[53:55] I didn't say Eternal I said perfect
[54:00] all right
[54:03] the domain we're in
[54:06] brings us the nature of that domain
[54:11] right
[54:13] so that's why we wound up being kin
[54:15] folks to the devil
[54:19] the beautiful wonderful soul that God
[54:21] gives to a baby
[54:25] mankind perverts it
[54:32] but yet we do it even in the religious
[54:34] realm what
[54:35] you take your little kids you send them
[54:37] to Sunday school and wanted to get up
[54:38] there and they do they sing the songs
[54:42] praise Father Son and Holy Ghost
[54:47] a trinity
[54:50] and then the preachers got to come along
[54:52] later and preach that out of us
[54:54] and don't think it don't hinder you
[54:57] don't think it don't hinder me it still
[54:59] hinders me to yeah
[55:02] oh but I got rid of it well praise God
[55:04] pray for me
[55:08] you see because that devil
[55:11] he is not in my soul
[55:13] but he's in the rest of me
[55:16] the rest of me still belongs that old
[55:19] domain
[55:22] my spirit my body is still in this
[55:25] domain of Satan my soul is the only
[55:28] thing that's eternal
[55:33] so then the Soul is the real you
[55:39] the real you
[55:43] God didn't come down to die for your
[55:44] body like I said the other day in a
[55:46] message you you might not listen to me
[55:48] sometimes but listen you might get
[55:50] something
[55:53] I was talking about the body that Jesus
[55:55] dwelled in you believe he was almighty
[55:57] God in flesh
[56:00] the Bible said he could give eternal
[56:02] life to who he desired right
[56:04] paraphrasing it the son of man
[56:07] he could raise the dead heal the sick
[56:10] what do you need to speak us a glorified
[56:11] bodies sister Gayle and just forget the
[56:13] whole thing
[56:15] because we would have been in a
[56:16] glorified body with a sinful soul
[56:20] right our spirit and our soul would have
[56:22] been sinful
[56:24] so he couldn't do that
[56:27] well he could have just no he couldn't
[56:29] just speak eternal life into you and I
[56:32] he had to make a way release that
[56:34] eternal life
[56:37] and to do that it cost him his life
[56:42] to let that Soul come out of him
[56:44] that could come back in you and I
[56:47] but before it could come back and you
[56:49] and I it went to hell and and preached
[56:51] to the souls
[56:53] even in that scripture of get it there
[56:54] if you'll read it it says the spirit's
[56:56] in prison
[56:58] read your scripture
[57:00] it doesn't say the Soul's imprisoned
[57:02] brother Branham put that to it because
[57:04] he said that's what it's saying that is
[57:06] the soul
[57:08] but the scripture says the spirits that
[57:10] are in prison they were disobedient and
[57:12] long suffering the days of Noah
[57:17] but are you listening
[57:20] the nature of the spirit
[57:26] so
[57:28] our soul
[57:30] comes forth in Satan's domain
[57:34] lost
[57:39] we take the nature of the world
[57:42] that's not just in our spirit
[57:45] the nature of the world is satanic's
[57:48] Realm
[57:49] Satan can't give you a soul
[57:54] right
[57:55] but he can pervert the nature of your
[57:59] soul
[58:00] he has no soul to be able to give
[58:05] he's a spirit being
[58:10] but it's just like the children of
[58:11] Israel when Balaam couldn't get God to
[58:14] curse him
[58:16] right
[58:19] what did he tell balik
[58:21] he said you get them more about women
[58:23] down here with them boys and it'll take
[58:25] care of it and that's what happened
[58:28] and God had to
[58:30] curse him
[58:32] see he knew how it was done but he
[58:35] couldn't make it be done himself
[58:40] so no matter what that we look at
[58:42] we look at a little baby and you know I
[58:44] love them little babies tonight but that
[58:46] baby is born in Satan's domain
[58:49] and by the time it's two years old it's
[58:51] live
[58:53] and Mama and Daddy don't lie but that
[58:56] little baby alive
[59:01] right
[59:02] you get him in somewhere along and I
[59:04] would call it the terrible twos
[59:06] yeah
[59:08] don't give him a stick
[59:12] he's going to want somebody in the head
[59:15] he's going to do like my wife she comes
[59:18] in one day and her daddy was laying on
[59:19] the couch and he was sound asleep
[59:23] and he was snoring at his mouth
[59:26] she thought he was hungry
[59:30] she goes and gets some soda crackers
[59:33] and she packed them in his mouth
[59:37] of course he tried to get that little
[59:39] devil out of her when he got through
[59:40] with her because he gave her a spanking
[59:42] right
[59:45] what you see
[59:47] the best you can train them little kids
[59:49] they gonna be kids
[59:53] if you don't want a kid to do something
[59:54] tell him not to do it
[59:57] right you better explain why he's not
[59:59] supposed to do it don't just tell him
[1:00:01] not to do it
[1:00:02] in terms of don't go out that door
[1:00:06] he's going to go out that door it don't
[1:00:08] make no difference he's going to figure
[1:00:09] out a way
[1:00:11] because he's a kid
[1:00:15] you got to explain it and they would
[1:00:17] whip the kids so I sat down and talk to
[1:00:19] him and they finally they discovered
[1:00:20] that Daddy just left me
[1:00:24] but I want to know why there's getting
[1:00:25] there with him explain to your kids when
[1:00:28] you get
[1:00:28] don't grab one up and slap it through
[1:00:30] the face let me see will you do that
[1:00:32] around here and I'm gonna have a talk
[1:00:33] with you
[1:00:35] because that ain't right
[1:00:40] there's another part of them that you
[1:00:42] can get more attention
[1:00:43] you remember what the little boy said he
[1:00:45] said my throats are hurting but they're
[1:00:46] going to give me a shot somewhere else I
[1:00:48] don't understand that well it got his
[1:00:50] attention and it'll get the attention to
[1:00:52] you get your little Hickory and just pan
[1:00:54] them lags just a little bit
[1:00:56] and you know what that old brain will
[1:00:57] start thinking
[1:01:01] because a baby is a soul
[1:01:04] now here's my point
[1:01:05] why do we want to raise them correctly
[1:01:08] the best we can do come on
[1:01:11] why do you want to raise your kids the
[1:01:12] best you can do
[1:01:17] what you you don't ever think about
[1:01:19] raising kids
[1:01:21] you want to raise them right don't you
[1:01:24] that's right why
[1:01:25] you want to raise them to where they can
[1:01:27] make the right choices they can do the
[1:01:28] right thing and it won't be hateful and
[1:01:31] mean and arrogant
[1:01:33] right
[1:01:34] you know what you're doing
[1:01:36] you're molding the nature of that Soul
[1:01:39] that's within that child
[1:01:47] the reason I preach
[1:01:49] I want my kids to hear the truth
[1:01:53] I'd have done quite a long time ago if
[1:01:55] it wasn't for that
[1:01:56] you say that's selfish
[1:01:58] I'm preaching to you too Lana
[1:02:02] I want you an opportunity to hear the
[1:02:04] truth
[1:02:06] I Don't Preach to go to heaven I don't
[1:02:08] have to worry about that
[1:02:12] but I want you to see the truth
[1:02:14] even if I got to make you mad if I got
[1:02:16] to make you arrogant and hateful with me
[1:02:18] and everything in the world I want to
[1:02:20] tell you the truth
[1:02:22] because then one of these days you'll
[1:02:24] come back and you'll say brother Dale
[1:02:25] you've done it right
[1:02:28] we just had problems
[1:02:30] yes and I did too
[1:02:34] but you see you're molding the character
[1:02:37] of that child
[1:02:39] well I'm not going to whip my child
[1:02:41] because the Bible says
[1:02:44] Spire the rod what
[1:02:48] convert the nature of the child in the
[1:02:49] wrong way did I mistranslate that or
[1:02:52] does that what that means fire the rod
[1:02:54] and spoil the child
[1:02:56] my kids didn't get down in the floor and
[1:03:00] scream and holler and kick
[1:03:03] I've seen them in Walmart that done that
[1:03:06] I've seen them in church that done that
[1:03:08] my kids didn't do that
[1:03:12] I didn't want that nature in them why
[1:03:15] don't you try to raise them right well I
[1:03:17] want them to mold their character turn
[1:03:20] them loose
[1:03:21] let the devil raise them then
[1:03:25] because that's what you're doing
[1:03:29] yeah but I don't want to hurt my child's
[1:03:31] feelings huh
[1:03:34] oh
[1:03:40] why is it so bad today that kids are now
[1:03:42] just killing their mamas and daddies
[1:03:44] Grandma and Grandpa brothers and sisters
[1:03:46] wow
[1:03:48] because somebody turned them loose
[1:03:51] and let them mold their character into a
[1:03:55] demonic condition
[1:04:00] that's right you say you don't you know
[1:04:02] better than that you don't don't talk to
[1:04:04] me about loving
[1:04:05] these kids around here know me
[1:04:07] they know one thing for sure brother
[1:04:09] Dale's a well Papa he's straight but he
[1:04:12] loves them
[1:04:14] you let that child know you love it why
[1:04:17] is it why is it a sign I mean a
[1:04:19] psychological effect
[1:04:20] that your kids would do wrong to get you
[1:04:22] to correct them
[1:04:25] then if you don't correct them what is
[1:04:27] wrong or somebody else's
[1:04:29] they're going to turn to something else
[1:04:30] you understand what I'm saying we're
[1:04:32] talking about Soul being the nature of
[1:04:34] the spirit
[1:04:38] that Soul inside of you
[1:04:40] has been brought to a condition by
[1:04:42] mankind
[1:04:46] we'll get to it in a minute we get time
[1:04:47] we don't we'll get to it next year
[1:04:50] all right
[1:04:54] see we are training our children
[1:05:00] to be wrong
[1:05:03] and then you bring them to me 16 years
[1:05:06] old brother Dale pray this Spirit off
[1:05:08] this child
[1:05:13] um
[1:05:16] I need to pray it off you first
[1:05:21] right
[1:05:23] but have you had ever had this I've done
[1:05:25] everything I can do
[1:05:30] but little Johnny he's got his own way
[1:05:34] who gave him his way
[1:05:41] there's one thing mom and daddy never
[1:05:44] had that you're looking at and these
[1:05:45] kids are sitting here can tell you but
[1:05:47] Nanny corrected I didn't come in honey
[1:05:49] she shouldn't have done it that way
[1:05:53] when I corrected him she didn't come
[1:05:55] along say now he shouldn't have been
[1:05:56] that mean to you and whipped you
[1:05:59] uh-uh
[1:06:02] we might talk to each other later about
[1:06:04] maybe we was a little bit tough
[1:06:06] you know but we didn't do it in front of
[1:06:08] the kids
[1:06:14] oh my Lord what do we got now he is hers
[1:06:16] and theirs
[1:06:22] I'll tell you what
[1:06:26] if this old boy ever entered one of them
[1:06:28] situations to marry there's going to be
[1:06:30] a lot of paperwork signed
[1:06:34] and that paperwork's going to say I can
[1:06:36] whip your kids
[1:06:38] and you can whip my kids
[1:06:43] I said will
[1:06:45] not Beat to Death
[1:06:47] but you deferred what you you tell me
[1:06:49] what the Bible means when it says
[1:06:51] about a child
[1:06:53] beat a child
[1:06:55] it won't die
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:01] that's not child abuse you're child
[1:07:03] abuse when you won't correct your
[1:07:05] children
[1:07:07] I didn't mean to get on that so maybe
[1:07:09] that'll at least let us know what a soul
[1:07:10] is
[1:07:21] nah
[1:07:24] Terence one day we was walking around
[1:07:26] there or we're under looking at some
[1:07:27] land and
[1:07:28] this old guy was standing there in a
[1:07:30] little long hair and he we got in the
[1:07:31] car and we started back around he said
[1:07:33] Daddy I'm glad you didn't look like Anna
[1:07:37] I said what are you talking about
[1:07:38] he said well that's the way I'd want to
[1:07:40] look you look like that
[1:07:46] remember they got their heart shorter
[1:07:48] than mine before I got mine shorter
[1:07:50] so we're not going either way all the
[1:07:51] way right
[1:07:53] but listen Church
[1:07:57] what about that nature
[1:08:00] all right
[1:08:02] the soul is the nature of the spirit
[1:08:06] so whatever you see on display
[1:08:11] something down inside is causing the
[1:08:14] problem
[1:08:15] now come on we can be Hypocrites because
[1:08:17] that's what Jesus was saying we'll get
[1:08:19] back to that
[1:08:20] he said you're a bunch of Hypocrites he
[1:08:22] said cause with your mouth you're saying
[1:08:23] you love me and I'm the master but said
[1:08:25] with the other you're trying to kill me
[1:08:28] all right there's Hypocrites there's
[1:08:30] people like that but we're not talking
[1:08:32] about that
[1:08:33] we're supposed to be talking about
[1:08:34] straight right Christians
[1:08:40] now how does that work
[1:08:46] let's read a few quotes and then we'll
[1:08:48] just one or two more and we'll quit
[1:08:49] we'll take it up this afternoon
[1:08:52] so look at the token preached in 1964
[1:08:55] 308 preaching Dallas number five on your
[1:08:57] notes
[1:08:59] my life could not come back into human
[1:09:01] because they wouldn't match the animal
[1:09:04] life has no soul in it the human life
[1:09:07] has her soul
[1:09:08] the animal doesn't know he's naked he
[1:09:10] doesn't know right from wrong he he he's
[1:09:13] a spirit
[1:09:14] but not a shovel now remember now the
[1:09:18] soul is the nature of the spirit of
[1:09:21] course he said let me read one or two
[1:09:24] look at the next one Revelations chapter
[1:09:26] 4.
[1:09:28] number 2 1961. uh 101 paragraph 248.
[1:09:33] and now on this system of Body Soul now
[1:09:37] if you'll get the word soul and look it
[1:09:39] up
[1:09:41] now this is your Prophet telling you
[1:09:45] it'll tell you in the Bible dictionary R
[1:09:49] Webster
[1:09:51] any of them
[1:09:54] what's it going to tell you what a soul
[1:09:55] is
[1:09:57] right
[1:09:59] it's the nature of the spirit
[1:10:03] now watch him explaining now here's a
[1:10:05] man we say here's John Doe all right
[1:10:07] John Doe and here's Sam Doe all right
[1:10:10] now John Doe is a man body he's a
[1:10:13] brother to sound dog now John is a
[1:10:16] spirit soul body
[1:10:18] and Sam doe is the same thing Body Soul
[1:10:21] spirit
[1:10:29] that's what I said read all you want to
[1:10:31] you're going to get confused
[1:10:36] but what's he saying
[1:10:41] John is a spirit soul body
[1:10:45] Sam is a body Soul Spirit well one's
[1:10:49] Runway and one he said it was the same
[1:10:54] he's explaining the three Realms of
[1:10:57] mankind not the position they're in
[1:11:00] come on
[1:11:03] he is Body Soul Spirit now this man is
[1:11:06] evil mean she's still alive commit
[1:11:09] adultery and evil thing and he can
[1:11:12] and any evil thing that he can do with
[1:11:16] this man is full of love peace Joy
[1:11:18] they both got soul body and spirit
[1:11:23] well what's the difference
[1:11:29] this man can go back and say I remember
[1:11:31] my mama I remember things that we done
[1:11:34] when we were boys both of them can they
[1:11:37] both got Spirits they both got Souls
[1:11:40] they both got body
[1:11:43] but the nature of this man's spirit is
[1:11:46] evil
[1:11:48] the nature of this man's spirit is good
[1:11:51] so the nature of the spirit is the soul
[1:11:55] of man
[1:11:57] according to that Spirit to have a
[1:12:00] nature is from the inside right so God
[1:12:03] is trying to get into what the spirit
[1:12:05] and heart of man where the spirit lays
[1:12:08] in the heart
[1:12:11] now
[1:12:14] God we can read Body Spirit soul soul
[1:12:16] Spirit we got it all figured out
[1:12:22] we'll pick up right here called in the
[1:12:23] next one let's read a little bit of it
[1:12:25] souls in prison this is 1963 11 10
[1:12:28] paragraph 36 or just read the first part
[1:12:31] now the soul of man is not the body of
[1:12:33] man it's the soul and the soul is
[1:12:35] something that's the nature of the
[1:12:36] spirit
[1:12:37] and then when the nature of a man when
[1:12:39] he said we are dead the scripture
[1:12:41] plainly tells us that we are dead and
[1:12:43] our lives are hidden God through Christ
[1:12:45] see you there by the holy spirit that
[1:12:47] wasn't that your body died it wasn't
[1:12:50] your spirit died
[1:12:54] come on
[1:12:56] it was the nature of your spirit died
[1:12:59] see the nature which is the soul
[1:13:04] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[1:13:06] born again
[1:13:07] if not it's of the world
[1:13:11] see the soul is the real you
[1:13:13] and whatever your spirit shows to the
[1:13:15] world
[1:13:16] is what's on the inside
[1:13:19] now we may be able to be our crit
[1:13:23] and tell people we love them but it
[1:13:25] won't be long
[1:13:27] you know when those Pharisees kept
[1:13:29] telling Jesus you're the master we
[1:13:30] believe you you're the
[1:13:34] but then when they killed him they kind
[1:13:35] of let them know where he's let him know
[1:13:37] where they stood didn't it
[1:13:38] don't worry about it
[1:13:40] you're only going to be a hypocrite for
[1:13:42] a while
[1:13:43] because you're going to be made manifest
[1:13:46] but around and said people talking about
[1:13:48] loving said fill a knife in your back
[1:13:55] right
[1:13:59] you see I've always believed in one
[1:14:01] thing
[1:14:06] I always believed in one little point
[1:14:13] if you love me
[1:14:18] then there's nothing I can do
[1:14:22] to make you
[1:14:24] not love me if you really do
[1:14:27] because I remember the Bible that says
[1:14:29] most what love covers what
[1:14:32] I wanted you to see him
[1:14:34] so no matter how bad I am
[1:14:38] if you love me you're gonna love me
[1:14:42] and that's from a deep-seated thing
[1:14:46] because you don't love with your body
[1:14:50] you just play love with your body
[1:14:54] you don't love with your spirit
[1:14:58] because that's this hypocritical guy
[1:15:00] body ain't no problem
[1:15:03] that Spirit can go either way
[1:15:05] but it's down inside of there
[1:15:09] there's a speck of the love of God
[1:15:14] then
[1:15:15] you can't help but love me
[1:15:23] that's what I told a man one time he was
[1:15:24] talking about having discernment
[1:15:27] I just went up to him later I said
[1:15:29] listen
[1:15:30] if any day the Lord tells you anything
[1:15:32] about me you just come tell me
[1:15:34] I'll be glad to hear it
[1:15:38] I said but there's one thing I want you
[1:15:39] to do for me
[1:15:45] I said if you got discernment and you
[1:15:47] can discern that I am wrong
[1:15:50] you can also discern that I want to be
[1:15:53] right
[1:15:54] because your discernment is of God
[1:15:58] right
[1:15:59] you discern but don't cut off
[1:16:02] well I just see you as wrong
[1:16:05] no if you got discernment it'll show you
[1:16:09] what I am
[1:16:11] in what my desires are
[1:16:14] you ever heard me make this statement
[1:16:16] come on brother
[1:16:18] I don't care for my wife knowing
[1:16:20] anything I've ever thought about her
[1:16:24] how many brothers would be willing to
[1:16:26] say that
[1:16:28] you don't care what your wife
[1:16:30] you know everything you've ever thought
[1:16:31] everything you've ever said everything
[1:16:33] you've ever done how many women would
[1:16:34] you say that I wouldn't care for my
[1:16:36] husband to hear everything I was but see
[1:16:38] there's an end to that statement
[1:16:40] that you don't listen to
[1:16:44] sometimes my wife says something and I
[1:16:46] don't agree with her and I don't like it
[1:16:48] I get upset
[1:16:52] and I think wrong
[1:16:58] but in a little bit
[1:17:02] the holy spirit says you know sometimes
[1:17:04] Prophet said people say thing to you see
[1:17:06] what
[1:17:07] how are you going to behave
[1:17:09] I said Lord forgive me
[1:17:12] but you see the main thing about my wife
[1:17:14] is because if she just ever remember the
[1:17:17] last thing is I love you
[1:17:19] it's a life thing it said at night
[1:17:21] before we go to sleep
[1:17:22] I love you
[1:17:25] foreign
[1:17:26] love covers a multitude of sin
[1:17:31] you tell me you don't think wrong I tell
[1:17:33] you you're dead
[1:17:39] we need to bury you
[1:17:42] right
[1:17:45] but yet the end of my thought
[1:17:50] you see the reason I say that is because
[1:17:52] that's the way I am with God
[1:17:54] sometimes I get frustrated sometimes I
[1:17:56] get all out of shape
[1:17:59] the way God's doing things and want me
[1:18:01] to do it and I don't want to do it
[1:18:04] I get all upset and I say Lord
[1:18:07] how about just letting somebody else
[1:18:10] take this thing and carry it on
[1:18:15] you know
[1:18:17] I just seem to work for me let somebody
[1:18:20] else carry it on
[1:18:25] but then I walk back and I think
[1:18:28] until somebody else comes along and can
[1:18:31] take it over I just keep going the way I
[1:18:33] am
[1:18:34] you know why because
[1:18:38] my part of the last is
[1:18:40] I want people to hear the truth
[1:18:45] not mass confusion like it is today
[1:18:49] now the people of the message are what
[1:18:51] trying to prove brother Brown was wrong
[1:18:52] like when Brother Ray was talking a
[1:18:54] while ago people hit 30 years ago
[1:18:57] would Squire about what he said and beat
[1:19:00] you if you said something wrong but now
[1:19:02] they're trying to pick it apart
[1:19:08] and they have the ability now to
[1:19:11] understand
[1:19:19] well see church we are displaying to the
[1:19:21] world what's within us
[1:19:25] and just remember
[1:19:26] there is an old saying you can deceive
[1:19:29] some of the people some of the time
[1:19:31] but what is it but not all the people
[1:19:33] all the time
[1:19:34] and just remember another thing you
[1:19:36] ain't deceiving yourself to start with
[1:19:39] because you know
[1:19:41] what you're trying to do
[1:19:47] the nature of the world
[1:19:49] is a strong force
[1:19:54] it takes the new birth to be able to
[1:19:56] conquer it
[1:19:58] then even in life
[1:20:00] what are we
[1:20:01] the prophet said until a change comes
[1:20:04] we'll be a sticker and we don't like
[1:20:06] that one do they
[1:20:12] don't mean we're sinful
[1:20:14] that's not what he's talking about
[1:20:17] it's a human being
[1:20:18] just be a human being we've got no
[1:20:20] problems
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:23] we're a sticker let's stand together
[1:20:25] what do we got brother
[1:20:26] number 668 Inspire book remember the
[1:20:30] soul is the real you
[1:20:33] it's more real than your body go ahead
[1:20:35] in your spirit
[1:21:00] last time
[1:21:02] some dinosaurs
[1:21:06] no more conditions
[1:21:10] what do we think about
[1:21:14] uh

[1:21:34] beautiful
[1:21:36] sins which were made
[1:21:54] into my life
