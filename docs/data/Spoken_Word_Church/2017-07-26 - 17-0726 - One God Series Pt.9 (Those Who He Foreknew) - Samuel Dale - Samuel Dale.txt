this if some are tickled to death cause it gets that 11 that's why you good okay alright we're going to try to continue our thoughts from this past weekend when we were expression and I hope you'll follow along with me because I want to make sure that you understand what I'm talking about and the way I'm trying to present it all right whether you agree with me or not that's between you and the Lord that's that's not for me to decide of what it's just for me to try to present what I see and believe and then for you to hear that and listen to the wording without trying to figure it out you know and it's like I was doing son do you want to add them could just do the part of the thing and part of the thing part of a little things showing because if you run it all up everybody's going to run the whole way down to the bottom they don't got it figured out where you go and what you're doing everything you ain't even started so this stay with us and listen to what I'm saying and then you know you can decide from that okay father we thank you for tonight and we pray that you would just bless us with your presence in your love we've prayed to you we've sung to you worship to Lord now it's time to talk about you in the word and father especially in the word of the hour that we're living in to where we're coming to the end of all things we ask you to just forgive our many sins and Lord we know and realize there's many sicknesses among us in a different ones Lord that are having the problems we pray that you would just come on the scene you promised it we believe it and just forgive our sins Lord because I know that there's so much dire in our hearts and our lives that hinder us from being close to you and just have your way let your grace be sufficient we need you so much we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen John 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god i hope by now we're getting a point of understanding that our thoughts of beginning our thoughts of like things like creation and creating is beginning to come in to a mouth set this way without being derogatory to a scriptural form because you know we can have our thoughts and ideas and say well i believe this and that's what we were told in this what we believe it this is what the word says and this is the meaning of the word but i'm not trying to get none of that to us that should have been taken care of but i'm trying to get our thoughts and ideas into the basis of the word of god being revealed to where we can walk therein and understand it from as I say scriptural understanding then then getting scriptural understanding is different from words that we try to come up with all right in our thinking because we say well that you know we just said what the word says well we found out a long time ago that that's not exactly right and there's a lot the word said that we didn't know it said a lot of things were said we thought it said something out you know all right until we found out the truth but just think about it so then right in the beginning was the word Word was with God in the Word was God the sign was in the beginning with God not to people you are your word and your thoughts in your mind and that's what I'm trying to get you to think about it's not here's the word had caught it said it said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God like well here's God and is with it and then it says and the Word was God now you've come back to the middle and your thoughts know as the same was in the beginning all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and the light shyness in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not right now here will be where I thought will be picked up from far tonight Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose all right the ones that are D called that's just a special group of people now the Bible is not written to everybody it's written to the born-again Christian it only tells the sinner that he's lost it's not written to him it just tells him he's lost all right now for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he called it whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things what can you say to them if God be for us who could be against us you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now as I said that's what I want to do is try to make sure you understand me I listen back we did to the services Sunday and I'm satisfied with it but I don't think it is with everybody to thinking of it because I kept drilling the emphasis over and over that I was talking about the mind of God all right and now to me oh like a cover we covered there with two creations right all right now what do you mean two creations there were two creations there was a spiritual as we call it that had no beginning none of it ever had any ended I gave you the paperwork for showing you what I was talking about but then we gave you the other side to show it as to be that everything that had a beginning has to have an ending to it right so now when it says here that we read in John in the beginning see now immediately we've got a problem because the prophets words were taking his words because we're opposed to do that and he said anything had to begin and got it ended well now you take John one that's why I read it over and over and over you read it back to me what in the beginning was the word word had a beginning so it means it'll have an ending then is that your understanding though immediately you see that our thoughts are not his thoughts then with that in the scripture my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts my thoughts are so much higher than your thoughts to your thoughts are not even in the picture never brother Colley speaking on that probably 35 years ago but think about it so when we read in the beginning we know immediately we've got to pick up some other thought because we cannot take playing language and follow that Scripture go do it say in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God so then the word had a beginning God had a beginning now we're in a terrible shape church I know that I'm um I don't know the best word I'll just call myself very bit and hateful that's alright I don't mean to be but I mean to be true flow to try to tell you the truth now if I ain't gonna tell you the truth I'll just quit and forget it and I never tried to PT patter about anything I've always just been blown about what I believe and I've always left it that way and I'll leave it to you if you don't agree with it come to mend let's talk about the only thing I've ever asked you don't go tell everybody how much you owe it to me first you know yourself how people have done that here and they got in trouble by going and not doing it in the right way so come to me and let's talk about it right now we talked about getting a point now we talked about to creation that I said one was God coming into and the Prophet said that God was his first creation well that ain't explained that one it can't be the wording we're reading of what we think that God had a beginning and it definitely can't be to her that brethren said we can't believe that God created Jesus and Jesus created everything else you remember that he said it can't be that so then we've got to clarify in our mind and get our thinking in the right order so when to me that it says and God was his first creation that really just simply means to me that God is coming into manifestation to where that he can be understood that's as simple as I can make it to where he's coming into manifestation oh whatever you want to call it you know changing formed and morphe etc but it means that it was like this piece of paper you can't see it but then here it comes into being now the paper was here all the time you just couldn't see it it had to be changed see for you to be able to comprehend it all right that's what I believe about God and how he's unfolding himself and revealing himself to mankind and it's being done in such a marvelous way that I tried to show you the thing and had that divided that were one side would have a beginning the angel had a beginning the world had a beginning Adams body had a beginning Jesus's body had a beginning yeah so you got to deal with each one of those all right now that's what we tried to bring it down to show but the soul of Adam had no beginning God had no beginning all right see then that way the soul of the Lord Jesus Christ had no beginning the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ had no beginning it was part of God and remember I brought that down to one side but on the other side you got the world you got angels you got all kind of thing and then I covered it this using God as I said there a moment ago the body of Adam wasn't eternal the body of the Lord Jesus wasn't eternal our bodies are not eternal let's see Adam was waiting on something to where he could be brought to the place right which is still waiting on us but Jesus didn't have to wait on nobody cause he was Almighty God but he redeemed the body not that it was sinful but it had a beginning all right and see then that's what he's doing to you and me by the revealing of his word he's redeeming these bodies he said well I just don't see it taking manifestation look like going the opposite direction well that's where we're going the same way again you're still running back to your mind you're running back to your thoughts what did you understand that with what are trying to bring see to creations that creation that started in genesis of Adam in his soul never had a beginning it was eternal no brother I said blessed be his name the breeze eternal life into Adams nostrils all right now we know for a certainty as I say in the Lord Jesus his soul spirit was eternal all right never had a beginning but his body did and had to be made eternal and it was all right now by that we can come to the place that our bodies can be redeemed now if we have eternal life tonight in the soul the soul is redeemed right it has eternal life or not it can never die but we're waiting the redemption of this body and the problem is the spirit that motivates between the body and the soul right because that's where our troubles of that because are where you memories your reason your concepts and etc gets involved and you try to figure things out all right now watch tonight what we're talking about let's divide God's mind and that's really something but what else we're going to say let's divide God's mind into two parts and I'll try to illustrate it like a human being now I'm not a doctor so if I get it wrong and I got the front in the back in the back the front now this you just straighten it all out and tell me later how long the wood in your brain you have parts that are conscious if your five senses work through through your brain huh but then you have unconscious part about you and that unconscious part about you keeps your body working while your sleep and you know keeps your heart going and then it's dividing that brain that mind all right then you can go only totally into the sub-conscience which goes back to show that you don't think with your brain goes all the way into the subconscious goes into the soul okay now I'm quoting brother Branham all right now but what I'm talking about let's look at that is two parts we were talking about and we're still back before the foundation of the world and our thinking we haven't come down any we're still back there that's why we went through that your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life you know the book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right we'll never be written there okay simple that's what the word says that's what the Prophet says okay now then we went through that in Jobe that it speaks about where were you when I laid the foundation world Morningstar saying together sons of God shouted for joy and brother and said I gave you the quote could it have been when they saw their name written in the Lamb's Book of Life he's putting them together run as an event in heaven or wherever you want to take it to whatever will keep dealing with it a minute in his mind but we're going to try to divide that mind because to me if we don't divide it when we don't know what in the world we're talking about now but then we covered them that to Genesis 1:26 man being a part of God and read around them I gave you the quotes and all where he said he was created in the image of God he says created in theophany and said he had control of the animals in that spiritual man and that spiritual man was the very life of Almighty God because it was in the image of God all right now think about it I've got a quota running over today forgot to bring anything but brother Adam is talking in simple language in our power phrase it'd be just a hard difference but it'd be pretty close he's saying if you want to know what God looks like look at man because he created them in His image and he said if you want to know what man looks like look at God because he created in His image right so there shouldn't be any arguments or what this was or that was surely by now you've at least can see that I believe Almighty God in the apne form looked like Jesus Christ that's what your prophet said Moses saw the back part I'm quoting brother Branham right and he said Abraham fed him a cave and he's talking about the same man all right so that Genesis 1:26 man waves dealing a lot with that and I'm trying to back away from some of the spots deliberately to leave it where he can have something to preach on God if I covered he's going to be running out you know I don't mean that running out and then debris said I just mean we'll cross each other too much so I'm trying to cover now a creation of God the subject has been for water quite a while own one God series that's what it puts a guy one guard series trying to understand God well nobody can't understand God he's the spirit he sees that's our old days of thinking that was when mama believed that hell was eternal and cold as him that's when the old preacher said there's got to be a Trinity and you know yourself you consume some of that you desire that people to get up and say the Bible says there's three gods you say well words of that I can't show it but but it says it me because grandma told me it said all right I love my grandma never didn't either but that's fine but grandma didn't know the truth right see our thoughts about what we think about things should change with the understanding of the word of God that had been brought to us by way of a prophet messenger don't you agree to that don't you think our thoughts should change he's not going to change him he said I'm God and I changed not so we don't worry about that but there's a lot of things we have or the change is like I said we read the Bible it says in revelation 3:14 that he's the beginning of the creation of God we're gone ahead of beginning cause it says right now he was the big that Jesus was ending up I said we've got all that to deal with in our mind and listen I'm a human being the reason I make those statements and to get you to clearly understand one time I know what Satan deals with the human mind and how he worked on those minds one because I got one when I know how it works online you ever seen something I mean really seen it your head God to reveal something to you I mean you really seen it and like one god you really seen one God you just couldn't wait till you run over to the neighbor or somebody or friend and started explaining one God the time you got there you done lost all the understanding is that right you lost all the understand you know how it was explained to you the ghost shows doesn't hit reveal all right but now listen if we can talk about the mind of God and how that in his mind now this is where I won't be going til you get it listen in his mind he's seen everything that would ever happen in this world you agree to that are you going to limit your God and say he didn't understand this or didn't understand that all right that settles that now there's no argument shouldn't be shouldn't even be so much under c'mon I think it was in there from that ourselves now why watch the point what are you trying to do trying to make yourself something because you're trying to say what if I had if I get a print it will come on unless you explain it mental problems I'm not sarcastic with that I'm just telling the God's honest truth I would have fought you years ago and you would have to over the ideas that we had that we thought were right right the dentist gradually see it come unfolding until we're losing those thoughts and taking his thoughts to see him what you see in God's mind now we'll say in a part of God's mind in a part of God's mind he could see the whole world because he ever person that would ever live everything at that everybody sigh one time he said how much Tyler that gnat would make I never didn't know they made Tyler but that's alright you agree that he's infinite to be able to do those things now then in that part of his mind he would see who would want to be saved and who would not want to be saved he would see why you wouldn't want to be saved or why you would want to be saved right what do you see everybody in the world that what that shouldn't be any problems to our understanding is to try to highway understand an infinite God who would know everything before anything ever moved or started or anything that in his mind he would know all things but then you know that most of you that have been with me over this you've been here a year you know this statement is always made I don't want to be just in the mind of God because at the same time I'm in the mind of God there's a lot of sinners that are living this world right along with me and they're in the mind of God to know that he knows what you're going to do so I don't want to be in the mind of God I've heard people say that you know preachers not all great blessed God in it something to be in the mind of God in the mind of God he saw everything he saw the people going to hell when hell's not eternal he's that strong enough speaking that he saw who would go Darden is not even it was made for the devil and angels and and people are intruders going there but what about it I don't want to be just what he thought of because what if he thought of you not be any term yes but I do this I approve of it you're getting into evidences and remember there's not but one evidence right we believe in shouting we believe in speaking in tongues we believe in crying we believe in everything we believe in the guilts we believe in order but there's only one evidence and what is that evidence whether or not the spirit in you agrees with order now watch continually agrees well you know yourself had a lot of people that agreed with a word for a while right you remember in your mind somebody that you was in your life and they went up good for a little while but then they just fell away so then that spirit was not there to keep them guided into that word so then the thing we've got to deal with is whether or not we can believe the word well what do you mean I believe everything in that you believe there was three gods in there when you first read it right did you get another book brother Larry actually got to with that no it's the same Bible you know what I don't say this because of it being that way Brett around and luck Scofield Bible's right that was his preference he used Thompson chain I know when he used different ones and he used all kind of but he liked the Scofield we you know what when I was in the Baptist Church I was that was to me in that way it was expensive my first Bible that's why he gave me the one but my first Bible about and not because I knew a brother branham I just had heard people talking of references from it that that it was a Scofield Bible was a good Bible one reason I like it one thing I like about the Bible the Scofield Bible you don't matter how big it is it can be heist that size it can be that big everything is on the same side of the page so if you remember and looking for something I was looking for a quote today and I knew exactly on the quote where brother Branham would say what I'll knew that I wanted him to say well because it was locked in my mind and that's good so you read you read we hear right over here johnjessy you got and that's the reason I like them all right that's didn't personal but listen then are we only going to deal with Redemption things like that are we going to only deal with it as to dealing with the mind in the part of thinking that God knows all things how are we going to put redemption into that well he knew I would want it run that's good but just remember until judas iscariot come to a certain spot he was doing pretty good there's nothing against him but then when he had to make the choices in life you remember Jacob and Esau the story and remember that's in the predestination right down below where we're reading in Romans that Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated now that was before either one of them ever come into the world what may God do that what made him choose Israel as his people are you in I'm talking about an infinite God who knows our very thoughts and and everything and while we're thinking while you're thinking now he knows why you're thinking that you're not hiding one thing from him I'm tickled to death I'm one thing for sure I've seen enough I'm talking about in the spiritual realm I do not want the gift of discernment I've seen enough with what I'm got what if you knew everybody never what they were thinking and that wouldn't work would it you think he'd be good but you'd wind up trying to buy lottery tickets and win the race horse trying to get the newspaper a day ahead of time alright that's the way you're thinking would go because you're human you remember they told brother branham said brother branham you tell us were that all that and said we'll put it all into the work of the Lord he said he knew they wouldn't do it and he wouldn't tell him so they drilled and they drilled didn't find it because they probably had a good idea vicinity that he was talking about but you know what happened somebody else oddball coming instead on gusher all right he said because he knew they were not sincere went about knowing that I don't want to know that I'd like to thank you love me I do I'm I could think hello although the devil gets on the other side and he says they don't do it they don't do it they don't do it to it that's all right we have some good arguments okay but now listen see then one part of God's mind would be thinking of everybody in their ways and what would take vice well then how would you do that by having your name written in a book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation world how would you justify that to come out as to be in right how would you have a point back that far to think about Morningstar singing together sons of God shouting for joy and remember God don't predestinate by his desires well now what are you going to do I asked you many things to do a lot of times and you know if you do it it had people but if you don't sign I still ask it we've done it one time I remember years ago if I was you and planning on listening to a lot of tapes you know what I do I would just go to this tape running now is on the seals I would just go to the first message after the seals and I start not listening or series from their own to the end of the message I give you a good thing to do you just listen to them in series one after the other and see if not all of those in that series is dealing with I always was eternal if you was eternal read listen to them he said well well I just don't have time to do that you you got time to go to Walmart honey and they're making it and I was really making it nice for you you just call them up or do it on the computer and you just write in your grocery list Lisa names life and they went up to what is a different game from Kroger they went up to Kroger the other night just pulled up in front of the sign and rolled the groceries out and set them Tripp the thing they never got out they tripped it they set the groceries in the car and close it up and they drove off well they're Walmart's doing those things so you know you got good use of going to Walmart now alright but nothing to do that to get that tide out of you for a second right now we see there's got to be a part of God's mind that we can't comprehend are you willing come on if you've been in this message for 10 years and listened to the tapes and things you know about the mind of God and you know about before the world begun and what happening and all of the things if not you ain't listen to the message so just forget it you ain't going to anyway what about that the Prophet gave this one I didn't give it to the image for I gave it the other day but I'll reread it what about on Chrysler mister God revealed priest in 1963 728 now God's secret mystery he had before the world begun now back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was going was trying and was going to achieve he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed they got it up there so you can read it what about the back part of God's mind I have trouble with the front don't you keeping up with life and in predestination zand but what about a prophet being able to go back in the back part of God's mind now may I state it again I don't want to be in God's mind as to just be what he thought of me being and life and pre destinations that's 90% of the people right today are still hung on predestination brother Branham said foreknowledge comes before predestination and we just read it in the Bible but it said a way that I won't get at this time but I'll get back to it it said very funny though it says those who he for no why did he put forward no why did they he not say those that he did for you or something why does it say for no we might find out a few things for the listen as you see that's what I'm trying to do Sunday dwelling with in God's mind he saw everything that would ever be in this world ever person that would ever be saved now listen and so everybody that would ever be saved he saw all of the days and life of mankind he saw all the people that would give their lives for the gospel he saw all the way down he saw all the way into the change of these bodies in his mind he saw all the way to the fifth seal Jew the tribulation millennium the white throne the future home and he winds up saying behold I create all things new if he knows that if he knows it like that and understands it that away he would understand who would want to be saved and who wouldn't well then why would a prophet speak of the back part of his mind if you want to call it front part back part two parts whatever you call it you do that I'm not a scientist nor doctor but I just got a little sense the in that part of his mind he could understand everything that would ever be right I'm not asking you to agree I'm asking is that right but he would understand that by his mind he would know you would want to be saved and the other people wouldn't want to be Sutton he would know ever better that if not he's not God all right we got that solved then we'll read the quotes in a minute we want God don't predestinate by his foreknowledge I mean predestinate by his desires dude he predestinated by his foreknowledge he predestinated by his foreknowledge notice design could he desire to everybody to be saved so then whatever you talk about predestination and that's what the people message you're still hung upon those times I'm predestinated I'll be higher I know I get in trouble let's look they say brother branham's tell me that I'll be there I said you better remember he went the other way one time too and he saw peoples are just don't crow when somebody knows what you're talking about because he went to the regions of the laws right and saw people was that where he saw you know he saw me in heaven cuz I love the word well what about all these doctor well I think brochures got it down there right he's got soles and you've got this of that if it ain't would pick up two lowers and then we'll get some you've done proved you're off the word you've done left the word I'm getting one point and that's all I want you to understand what I think in a way I think if there is a back part of God's mind is he had a secret mystery that would deal with his coming into being expressing him in his attributes Nicole and I'm gonna keep quotes or don't don't told me at the same time he would know about the Seventh Seal the coming of the Lord is that the same part of the quote from Christ mystery I'm put it all in that one about not leaving anything out I'm just trying to show you that all fish but what is that back part and brother Randall says iron cry so much he said God had a plan and he was going to see it achieve what the plan of predestination and the things of foreknowledge at the world that you see that everybody's involved in can see those son what is it there was left to be a mystery what do you think see then you'll see why I don't want to be just part of his thinking because part of his thinking could put me in the wrong blood ish but if I'd be a very part of that one that done the thinking see there's the great mystery the mystery he had a plan now may I ask you this question I ask it the other day and just backed up mask you again will everybody receive eternal life no they won't they won't receive eternal life everybody one so then what is it it's not far then to her that's God's foreknowledge he knows all about it once your desired all the things but get the point could this thing wind up a little bit closer to talking about his mind than to just think about what he thought of you realize now let me ask you and you're gonna have to think so listen nobody awake enough a sinner is not in any way a part of the attributes of God now don't make it an attribute that we got lost don't do that please don't don't even spend your time trying to figure that out that one attribute was he know he knew that if he gave us free moral agency he knew what we would do is that agreeable what about a situation of Adam and Eve with eternal life in their soul and that's a quarter bless Venus times when you argue run around you mean God knew they was going to fall yeah he knew if he put them on free moral agency that they'd fall right so don't get your head blowed so big that you think you can't stumble and fall because I am NOT talking about and I'm never called a demand Eve I've taught it this way you can't put Adam in Hell now not with eternal life don't put either either because she was in Adam and t apne I'm quoting brother branham she was part of Adam so they don't try to fool with doing something just think about what I'm talking about God put Adam and Eve in the garden the way he wanted to put every one of us which he would create us a body to live in and then he would place the spirit within us and the soul within that individual it would be eternal Adam soul was eternal then the Tree of Life was there and we go to the Tree of Life and partake of the Tree of Life in you remember how over in the story a little bit it was said we got to put this man out lest he / take of the Tree of Life and you better close your mind just to her - you're thinking of how wording is it because the Bible says lessee protected the tree of life and live forever it does not say he turned on even ever one of us could have walked upon this earth in the tree of life would have been there which is one problem there was another tree put there too because he knew that we're not going to happen he knew not going to happen that way he knew bringing Adam and Eve into being would be great but he and that would be his glorious to get his worshipping the things that he knew man was going to follow he knew you and I was going to follow problem was see we never reached like Adam so when we fell we did fall we fell to death he said when I got in the field book were written go ahead I know the quote brother Adam said Adam fell from eternal life to death that's 100% correct he never reached he turn alive in his body so he fell from coming to that place your prophet is still right that's why I love the word all right but get the point in brother Dale you seem to be pointing to something else back there why would it be that the morning stars would be singing because in the sons of God be shouting for joy and the name was being written in the Lamb's Book alive before the foundation of the world the Angels was worshiping because as I brought out Sunday those angels would would have an immigrant I'm because they were created for the purpose of being to those that would be heir of salvation that's why the Bible says you won't judge angels why I know brother random quotes two-thirds but you by most of the third so you ain't arguing with nobody just telling you how it is is it two thirds or thirds some of them fail and we're going to judge them the ones that fail but the ones that didn't follow you ain't going judges they gonna be happy in heaven too glorious because they're going to get to be there they're going to get a reward one day because they kept their job and done it Emanuel is great don't think he's going to do away with them here but around says when we get over there them Angels will be just as real as we are do you need that courtroom alright listen what are you talking about what's your point my point is don't get locked in on in your mind in his mind and that's as far as you can go to just get into the mind and think about the rediff t or the pre destinations are the things just keep going on back go back to the quotes you want them where the Prophet would say if you wasn't back there you never will be back there you need to know I don't say something that I don't have what about it you seem to be placing it there's maybe a little bit more to in his mind than just his thinking I'm glad you thought of that it's wonderful now you're at least listen but you see you can't do that until you itself realize that by that new birth that you have in your soul is Almighty God to give eternal life to your soul it wouldn't he kernel didn't come he was back there all souls were I still got a lot to preach Zeki LinkedIn forwards that what did we're all shoulder mine but we're about souls with your time as you see if you lock in your mind you can go back and see that in your mind in his mind he could see ever show that would ever be and the choice that show would make and the way that troll would be but that's not it's planning purpose you realize that there will be a lot of people receive eternal life who is virgins Phil Phil to Old Testament Saints all because you are his child not cause at what they do it will predestinate any of them by God's desires or anything don't predestinate by trying to be good we just innate by foreknowledge you'll come out to the right story what are you talking about Bill Adele I'm talking about one time there's a group of people on this earth that are not just born-again Christians not just good people but they're the very children of Almighty God they're his offspring and they existed with him before he had any foreknowledge of the world you wouldn't listening I wouldn't pay an attention I brought everything as deliberately as I could that those names written in the Lamb's Book of Life was for the foundation of the world or anybody ever come into being morning stars sang together under God shouted for joy that was back there before anything ever coming to being Genesis 1:26 man let us make man you know but that's going back too far no it's not so you're not going far enough you're stopping yourself by understanding this the mind you've got that part in your understandings now you're getting it right and praise God for that don't lose it but now step a little bit further if we think redeemed means when we were a sinner and we was redeemed that's good but just remember redeem means to go back where you come from did you know all right because our as far in your Redemption you want to go back to where you start up in God's mind are you listening is that as far as you want to go because you're going to redeem yourself out of existence and don't know it are you listening what do you mean I mean one time if we going to a point that in God's mind at one level in his thinking he thought of everybody that would be saved and wouldn't be saved you say well then he could redeem me cause I wanted to be saved just remember it's got to go back further because you're going to redeem yourself out of existence that don't mean nothing to you but I cry God give me some word I know I'm not understood I know the human part but you see we've got to get back fathers and just think about in God's mind we were there for that I want to go back to be part of his mind you realize I was trying to enter a minute ago you realize all them sinners and all the people we give an eternal life it's because of you you realize they would not get eternal life had you not come the way you come let's explain it to them if you hadn't to come the way you come that Center out there wouldn't have no type change of eternal life but because you've come the way you come there's a lot of people going to be in heaven and that's why I love brother branham's the message he said them either in them countries that never heard the gospel he said there'll be giving each other life why now the cauldron he said because of the way they live according to their laws what a wonderful shaker it would say people that know nothing about he but run said he healed those Jews every day and they reject him instead he heals them in Dutch farm every day you don't ever listen to the message like that to think of my what a wonderful Savior we have but then just don't cut yourself obviously said to get to thinking of the mind and say well that's it far as we can go back to the mind that he thought of their sin he's out of that he thought of us he thought of that you're cutting yourself short because you're not listening to the interpretation result whom he did or no then he did foreknow or gain is the definition of the word or to know are know before to have knowledge beforehand to for know to predestinate know which comes first you stop your for knowledge at just the mind part that you're thinking that everybody is there in thinking of that for knowledge he foreknew this he foreknew that and they just put us all in our together you don't have God's plan and purpose like I said healing of the sick remember what was raining out Sunday I told you what brother Brian said on that message of listening healing of the state he said it's talking about the resurrection no divine healing no resurrection you know what that means divine healing is a lot earnest of a lot glorified body that's your prophets word divine healing is an earnest of a glorified body if he can heal this body he can change it it's not going to be hard to be done we think it is we put it to where we can't get to it we say it's something that we can't attain unto and just remember eternal goes just as far as that away as it goes that away and it don't go around and meet somewhere okay it's from east to west instead of north to south north and south would meet the east and west is what it can never do because you just go around the east you just gonna keep on going ain't no you know here so far they turn out to be West listen church this is what I'm trying to preach God had a plan and a purpose that he was going to reveal himself to his offspring not reveal himself to the world that's not his plan and purpose if you're locked in on that I think about you to stop a little bit and think it's not just the world being saved is his attribute remember now listen remember his attribute is eternal as he is because it is him what about right around to say in this statement that God is not complete without you that's the statement he's not complete without you I don't understand you what are you saying you mean salvation is not for the world no it's not for the world it's far them because God allows it to come into manifestation because of the way he designed it and made it because in that way somebody being good to you can receive eternal life somebody going over and doing this without of the other are some he turn living according to the laws of his own country can be given eternal life but he's not in God's foreknowledge and plan he's in God's foreknowledge of what he will do but he's not in his plan he's predestinated to a destiny but he's not in a part of God's foreknowledge are you listening to Scripture those he did for no I thought the Bible said that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world so it's not whether I chose they're not and kind of do it it's whether he was chosen all right now then him being chosen I ain't got no problem all I got to do is just relax and what he's giving you give him the he brought me to my inheritance what is my inheritance eternal life all right remember that one right brain out the other day God never that Jesus never gave you an inheritance he only come to pay the price to bring you back to it what was the inheritance eternal life before the foundation or can you go that way he chose us in him before the foundation of the world when he was chosen with children who you know how quick he was chosen must have been very short because he jumps from the fact of being self-existing to right straight over into the word and he begins to create and ask the Lord Jesus Christ now Jesus of last Oh Lord Jesus Christ what about it what do you get now divide that mind up then and think about that in God's mind you were not just something he taught us that you're a part of his mind why why would you even consider being a thought are being the point of it being because he has given you eternal life he is the only one who has eternal life and he's given his bride he turn alive that's why your Old Testament Saints they're not counted in eternal life ways bring it out wonderful they're not in the promise and we have better thing for them that day without us could not be made perfect they're coming to their promise because we come to ours what is it going to happen this message has to go from here to Israel where the random was so close he said I believe I'll go but then he was told he was on the way to go right the Lord told him to the knick with you then rides not fool yet go back home what are you saying I'm saying if you have eternal life message search we would see Jesus 1964 if you ever was in God's thinking you'll always be there if you got eternal life you are the expression or the attribute of his stop by this age what about a church you lean not to your own understanding you see if you were in the foreknowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God and the only way you can be a son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God and God isn't complete without you I've heard but now I see God the Great God if you got eternal life then the germ of life was in God at the beginning and you were there you were in his thinking your name and all and he by foreknowledge ordained you to see this but if you're not ordained you'll never see it so then it's farther than just going back to the thought of predestination because everybody comes by predestination it's better than going back to say foreknowledge because everybody comes by foreknowledge but there is a group of people who if you have eternal life tonight that's why the Prophet would say it the most important thing in your life is the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean got it here we you know in your soul then that eternal life always was God before the world he's the one still thinking he's still thinking through you he's transmitting his thoughts through you may I say it why did sister Hattie ride - what brother Branham said did brother Branham that ain't nothing but the truth she picked up a thought from God right and she expressed that thought concerning what the man had spoken and she got the salvation of her two sons so if you want to stop with predestination and for knowledge as to just thinking about being in God's mind hold on to that don't lose it which see for many years my thoughts has been going back further than that who want to go back into his mind and you just think about that profit that's why I emphasize it so much that profit went back into God's mind and brought out of God's mind the revelation for this day that's why I asked you if you would you say what do I need to do start tape number one after the seals is preached and just play them one after the other one it'll take you two or three years but you know what within that you might find what will change because I thought we believe rapture in faith late in the message of the hour I didn't know that it laid in no man I thought it laid in there and the fact of being the Word of God brought to mankind by servant of God that could go all the way back in the mind of God so I can tell us about Ash old and how to go beyond the curtain of time and come out and say that I in July himself I was looking at him yesterday that angel referred twice and said this is sold under the altar 4dc beyond the curtain of time souls of mankind what was he he was in theophany because he wasn't in human flesh it was laying on the bed he said yeah but now my brother Dale I can't go we okay that's fine I can't go with you about you you think and shoulders you theophany well I didn't say it brother Branham did okay that's that's up to you now I didn't say it he did huh would you say that I think your shoulders over yonder do you have and I'll quote the scripture about eternal life do you have eternal life at dark and eternal life in here there's the secret that man never knew even Paul and them could not get it into the foolish understand of how that when that new word comes into an individual it steps him back just as it would have been had there been no fall now quote right around him spoken words original seed he said he would go right back to where he was in the beginning they listened his words he knew to heard it know it he said I just caught that with him back right where he should have been no problem with a change in the body that's what we're trying to get it I've never worried about a change of the body I'm preaching to the spirits of mankind because if your soul is eternal and I don't have anything do that then the only thing is keeping you and me from a change of the body is this spirit that's within us the reason of memory and the conscious tonight I thought he said the greatest battle ever fought I didn't know Christians didn't have that I thought we were the basic ones he was preaching up that had that right the battle to a center in a battle one more time we'll go God in his mind could see everybody and predestinate everything to be by his foreknowledge but then in the back part of his mind he had a plan and a purpose now listen he didn't have a plan and a purpose to just save people I'm going to come on down to the word he said he had a desire to be father he created Adam and Eve that made him father a desire to be worshipped he created angels and they worshiped you know that really your father the gospel now your father is not the Jehovah the Old Testament your father is the son of man according to your prophet your father according to the prophet in the New Testament dispensation is the Son of Man that's what he says you won't that quote be glad to give it you're to know it he said that was the only way he could be the father he wanted to be was to be the son of man come on show her wake up he said son of man I thought we believed the four Gospels I thought we read them I thought in the four Gospels that you find the son of man sowing the seed of the kingdom was he so deceived and then he gave his life to where it would release the life that could come back and water the seed to make it alive my father is the son of man but the Son of Man is not William Branham I preset in 1968 he is not the Son of Man he is a son of man but I can't help it your prophet said that the bride would in the life state would be the son of man the Word made flesh now that's his words well I don't understand that does that mean he's wrong does that mean he's wrong and you're right come on musician the simple little point let's go back further in God's mind than to just a predestination or Presbyterian Baptist doctrine you know what the Presbyterian and all of it is very far cause he's one who told me I'm standing right here and I step off I'm glad I got that done I don't have to do that no more that's done that's Presbyterian predestination you know the Baptist Church was totally split by two brothers over predestination they were preaching predestination all the way I like the way brother instead he said Iranians said when that life seed comes in he said the Lord of come in city by predestination she said what are you talking about then is there something else stepping back into the mind of the one that is doing the thinking you realize what that makes the children of God that makes the children of God God's offspring that makes the children of God God made manifest in another form called a bride predestination the Prophet said it's not too bad of a word after all he said if you see it by foreknowledge I won't say it one more time and let you think all didn't say by for knowledge he said those who he for know those that were not just known of him but were a part of him that's the eternal life I'm preaching that's the children of God I'm preaching that's that new birth in your soul right now it's not just to say I'm a child of God you're a part of God made manifest called a son goes back further than we ever thought about going right I'll go ahead and say it and you can do what you want to do brother Randall made two statements about the let us make man one of them he said let us make man he said who was he talking to so you're talking to another being one time he said he's talking to the animals he had created one time he was talking about like it was another person or something it is its word and spirit its father and son word and spirit God in more freeing downward and when he had more fees down he's coming to his bride she is a part of him made manifest in a new birth not just something he thought of not just like the rest of the world he thought of but she's part of him go ahead but 223 in Redbook listing 104 them over but do you have eternal life [Music] that's the mind's eye is accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior to have eternal out then when that eternal life comes in you're just as eternal as he is because you're him make money you're him man made manifest in another form holder prize do you think that about son of man is not right I asked you to read revelations 1 when you get home you can see that I've set that back dark 69 what does it say 1 standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps with a golden girdle that is description of oh Jesus Christ in his bride [Music] when a prophet said she will be lease on a man you don't you don't think about it and he's my father if not how did we get here he had to sow the seed of the Bride of Christ in his life that he could quicken that scene and give us eternal life to make us his children oh I'm not concerned whether I was predestinated I'm just trying my best to be what he wants me to be that's a part of him d5 Forrest you wonderful wonderful ah if I have a need wonderful see I'm just talking in simple plain language about the sign
