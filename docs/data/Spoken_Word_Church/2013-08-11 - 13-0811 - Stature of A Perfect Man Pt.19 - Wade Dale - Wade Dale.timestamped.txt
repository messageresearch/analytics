[0:00] study instead of us just talking about
[0:02] first one thing and another at
[0:04] responsive reading just I think it kind
[0:06] of Mellows everybody out gets us with
[0:08] our mind so that we can
[0:10] start cuz uh it's hard enough doing this
[0:14] with uh with you know with the right
[0:16] attitude and the right spirit and that's
[0:18] all of us so Hebrews chapter
[0:21] 11 this is the uh great faith
[0:26] chapter and I want to watch these people
[0:28] and watch the character istics of these
[0:31] people now remember these people that
[0:34] we're going to talk about today only had
[0:37] a
[0:39] promise they had a promise but they
[0:42] didn't attain unto the
[0:46] promise they didn't receive the Holy
[0:48] Ghost everybody understand that people
[0:50] in the Old Testament did not have the
[0:53] new birth baptism of the Holy Ghost like
[0:56] you and I in the
[0:58] soul everybody got that that everybody
[1:01] understand that it's been taught to you
[1:03] for years because even the Bible in John
[1:06] 5 says the Holy Ghost was not given
[1:08] because Jesus had not been glorified or
[1:09] he had not released that life he was
[1:13] Jehovah God that had all these
[1:15] attributes in him but Jehovah God had to
[1:17] become Jesus Remember Jehovah the old is
[1:19] Jesus of the new so the Holy Ghost was
[1:21] withholden in the Old Testament cu the
[1:23] blood of bulls and goats can't do it in
[1:25] other
[1:27] words there's a flip side to all these
[1:31] people Noah had great faith Noah built
[1:34] an ark Noah saved his
[1:37] children Noah did a lot of things he did
[1:39] what God told him to do totally contrary
[1:41] to what scientists
[1:43] said but he died a
[1:48] drunk Solomon the greatest man that ever
[1:50] walked on the face of the Earth so the
[1:52] Bible
[1:53] says had all wisdom and prudence and
[1:58] wealth to women got him to serve Idols
[2:01] at the end of his life he would have had
[2:04] the new birth that wouldn't happened
[2:06] David a man after God's Own
[2:09] Heart had his best friend killed now
[2:12] that's not brotherly kind of had his
[2:14] best friend killed so he could cover up
[2:17] he'd already committed adultery with the
[2:19] man's wife but to cover it up she found
[2:21] out she was pregnant so he knew one
[2:23] thing for sure he had to get rid of that
[2:25] guy now what a scoundrel what a
[2:27] rascal but remember
[2:30] the blood blood of bulls and goats could
[2:32] not do away with sin how many times
[2:34] brother R say that it can't do away it
[2:35] covered
[2:36] it and pushed it to Calvary now when
[2:39] Calvary comes Paul looks back into the
[2:42] Old Testament and says Abraham was
[2:44] strong in faith receiving the promise
[2:47] well he didn't look at Abraham giving
[2:48] away his wife
[2:50] twice or trying to you understand what
[2:53] I'm saying laughed at God all these
[2:55] people in the Old Testament had human
[2:58] flaws human flaws but they did not have
[3:02] an indwelling of the Holy Ghost to burn
[3:05] out the old
[3:07] man they had an anointing just like the
[3:09] anointed ones at the end time it's the
[3:12] same identical anointing because
[3:13] remember the anointed ones at the end
[3:14] time is not anointing with a false
[3:18] anointing it's the true baptism of the
[3:20] Holy Ghost anointing someone's body and
[3:25] spirit or Spirit basically because the
[3:28] body just does what the spirit tells you
[3:30] but inside they're black well now that's
[3:33] the way it was with Moses look at Moses
[3:36] he was a
[3:38] murderer right murdered an
[3:40] Egyptian did a lot of things contrary to
[3:43] what God wanted him to do he was he was
[3:46] he was flawed in a sense because he
[3:49] couldn't go to Across the promised land
[3:52] in a type that that that's the promised
[3:54] land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:56] and that's why Joshua is the type of the
[3:57] of the believer or the new the new birth
[3:59] Earth in the end time or in the seven
[4:03] Church ages everybody got that there's
[4:06] no way God could clean out an individual
[4:09] totally Body Spirit and soul in the Old
[4:11] Testament
[4:13] because when Adam did what he did in the
[4:17] Garden of Eden that blocked all the Sons
[4:20] and Daughters of God from being born at
[4:22] that moment got it cuz remember God
[4:26] won't dwell in an unclean
[4:28] vessel Eve became
[4:33] unclean so that stopped it didn't stop
[4:37] it just it just hindered God's program
[4:39] nothing ever hinders God it just
[4:42] hindered the program that we're looking
[4:43] at backwards see it never hindered God
[4:46] God knew all that was going to happen
[4:48] but he made provision in the Old
[4:50] Testament to make sacrifices and
[4:52] offerings and things so that the
[4:55] believer it's like you hear many times
[4:57] he said he'll he'll put the Lamb on on
[4:59] the altar heel he he believed see there
[5:03] go back to Faith he believed that when
[5:05] that lamb died that he would that lamb
[5:07] was taking his place right but there was
[5:10] no way that the blood of that lamb the
[5:12] life right there was no way that literal
[5:15] life of that lamb could come over into
[5:18] the believer and say I've washed you
[5:22] that's right no I've just covered you
[5:26] that's right until I come and do the
[5:28] work
[5:30] right cuz Jehovah God was God above
[5:34] us Jesus was God With
[5:37] Us now it's God in us that's right why
[5:41] why wasn't it God in the first Adam sold
[5:45] out the human race so that no Sons and
[5:47] Daughters of God could be born the way
[5:49] God wanted them to be born to Genesis 1:
[5:51] 126 and 27 man right cuz we were
[5:56] supposed to come and multiply under
[5:57] plenish the Earth but I'm trying to set
[5:59] about background cuz a lot of people
[6:00] even maybe on the internet uh most
[6:03] people in the message believe that they
[6:04] had the new birth or had the Holy Ghost
[6:06] in their soul in the Old Testament there
[6:07] is no way that can happen right no
[6:11] way look at how they
[6:13] acted all of them but God was showing in
[6:17] tight how that like you come up and you
[6:19] still got the old adamic nature but once
[6:22] God Burns that inside old man out the
[6:24] only way that can happen is is the life
[6:26] of that
[6:27] sacrifice the life in that blood had to
[6:31] come on not on the believer but in The
[6:35] Believer got it right lamb could only
[6:39] Capo
[6:42] cover got
[6:43] it but the man still went out and if he
[6:46] was a uh you know I don't know I just
[6:49] say he was a
[6:50] liar and he said God forgive me but see
[6:53] there was no way that's why that
[6:55] David God loved David because he had an
[6:58] honest and contrite heart
[7:00] he could look into the very part of
[7:02] David and say
[7:05] David I'm just carnal like my dad David
[7:08] I'm sorry that I can't get in your soul
[7:11] cuz if I could get in your soul we'd
[7:14] have a party you understand what I'm
[7:15] talking about we'd have a time right but
[7:18] he but but he knew if David had the Holy
[7:20] Ghost see there go back to
[7:21] predestination again he knew if all
[7:23] these Old Testament people could receive
[7:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost well Lord
[7:28] they'd have been mightier than are were
[7:30] here because the life would have went
[7:31] with the actions see they had the
[7:33] actions the Holy Ghost would come down
[7:35] and anoint David and he would just
[7:37] speaking the first person but now when
[7:39] that anointing came off of him now when
[7:41] that anointing was on him he didn't go
[7:43] kill UAH or have relations with bash
[7:48] Sheba
[7:50] right even Jesus himself had an
[7:53] anointing my God my God why has Thou
[7:56] forsaken me he knew that anointing
[7:57] wasn't on him anymore but he was wasn't
[7:59] the Holy Ghost leaving him it was
[8:00] anointing for his message for his
[8:02] ministry that he brought but in this
[8:04] chapter we see these people that through
[8:07] these flaws though you and I can see the
[8:11] character building that we need in the
[8:14] end time I say in the end time cuz we're
[8:16] here okay they needed it in the first
[8:19] church age and had it all the way
[8:20] through but it's been sort of eroded and
[8:22] that's why the statute of a perfect man
[8:24] is so important because it's a step
[8:27] remember we read where brother said this
[8:29] is in other words got the Daniel 70 week
[8:32] statue of a perfect man then going into
[8:33] the seals if you're not a walking
[8:36] breathing instrumentality of God sealed
[8:38] in by that top Holy Spirit up there God
[8:41] cannot reveal the seals to you the way
[8:43] he wants to do you understand what I'm
[8:44] saying yeah you can get a partial light
[8:47] you can get a partial understanding but
[8:50] until all those virtues are working in
[8:51] your life there is a part
[8:56] missing there's a part missing you don't
[8:59] have have brotherly kindness there's a
[9:00] part
[9:02] missing so we got to see that once we
[9:06] take this pyramid and we're we're still
[9:08] at Faith on number about 18 or
[9:11] so but faith is the key for all these
[9:14] things you say well I can't do it well
[9:17] then you
[9:19] can't God made Provisions for you to do
[9:21] it he give you the Holy Ghost the Holy
[9:24] Ghost has those things in
[9:27] it let me just put it way it's like I
[9:29] said about the
[9:30] pill but remember with that pill it's
[9:34] layers it's gelatin right or yeah gel
[9:37] the pill and it a a slow release
[9:41] pill you used to take slow release pill
[9:44] you know and and you take one it last
[9:46] you all day why there was coating on
[9:49] that pill well there was just enough of
[9:51] what you needed for one hour and then it
[9:52] would dissolve and then the second layer
[9:54] would dissolve and
[9:56] then you got seven layers
[9:59] of appe pill that God gave you called
[10:02] The Holy G it's
[10:04] there see virtue doesn't have to come
[10:07] from above that's what we're looking for
[10:10] sometimes I think we we go to to praying
[10:12] and and even fasting and saying God I
[10:14] want virtue God I want virtue and he
[10:15] said it's in you you've just got to
[10:18] exercise it you got to put it in the
[10:21] right
[10:22] environment to
[10:24] learn that's all that's all you got to
[10:27] do so temples like brother Ron was
[10:30] talking about the orchestra and and the
[10:32] symphony Friday night at the at the camp
[10:35] meeting and it was really
[10:37] wonderful that you got all these players
[10:40] in the different parts of the world and
[10:41] then they all come together to make one
[10:43] great
[10:44] Symphony and you can't be off and he
[10:47] said it's like you know the little
[10:50] triangle that guy may only have one
[10:53] note and then he's done practiced for
[10:57] years to to be in this great Symphony
[11:00] Orchestra and he looks down and he's got
[11:03] one note when he looks and sees that
[11:05] note realizes it's his and he DS he's
[11:09] done but then you got the ones that play
[11:12] the first chair second chair third chair
[11:14] I was thinking about the all the pieces
[11:17] in a symphony well that's kind of want
[11:19] you get the new birth you've got the
[11:21] you've got the tools to do what you need
[11:23] to do with but it takes a five-fold m
[11:26] Ministry mystery fivefold min Ministry
[11:29] for the perfecting of the Saints so
[11:31] you've got to you can't just get virtue
[11:34] sting it home by yourself but what
[11:36] happens is is you we're the ones we the
[11:40] five-fold ministry is supposed to like
[11:42] brother R said take the blinders off
[11:45] your eyes that the devil's put on you
[11:47] and said hey you can't do
[11:48] that well some way somebody's got to
[11:51] contact God to contact you to say hey
[11:54] you got it already in you don't look for
[11:56] it to come from somewhere else now it's
[11:59] in the word of God it's in the prophet's
[12:01] message right you just got to be
[12:05] here right to get it that's right and
[12:09] praying and fasting and all is good but
[12:12] what does that do that gets you out of
[12:14] the way that's
[12:15] right that means you put a capsule
[12:18] around it that God can't get to remember
[12:20] he's a gentleman he's not going to bust
[12:23] through your free moral agency what
[12:25] brother Dale has been preaching he's not
[12:27] going he's not going to just come in and
[12:29] start cleaning your house out he's going
[12:32] to ask you or he's going to tell you
[12:34] through a five-fold Ministry what to do
[12:36] and if you don't do it then that you the
[12:38] door knobs on your side
[12:41] so I feel like there's a a big
[12:43] difference between believing in faith
[12:47] because the Old Testament people truly
[12:49] believed God because of the things that
[12:51] happened and what they were able to but
[12:54] Fai the revelation of his word and Who
[12:57] We Are
[12:59] that's that's the important thing
[13:02] because remember like this treaty was
[13:04] saying Abraham I don't believe Abraham
[13:07] got up one day and and God spoke to him
[13:11] and he said man I need to go live this
[13:13] life because somebody 2,000 years ago
[13:15] going to no they just got up and did
[13:19] what they were supposed to do God said
[13:22] get up leave so he got him
[13:24] left but now remember he's still human
[13:27] he took lot with him God didn't tell
[13:29] take anybody with him he said you didn't
[13:32] say you and your family so lot's first
[13:33] mistake was but now still God honored
[13:36] that right he still he didn't go away
[13:39] from Adam Abraham and say oh Abraham you
[13:41] didn't do what I said no he did part of
[13:43] what he said but he knew Abraham was
[13:46] going to continue the journey that's the
[13:49] difference that's the difference in
[13:51] every one of these people and the
[13:53] billions of people that were on the face
[13:54] of the Earth during this time these
[13:58] people
[13:59] people did something nobody else did
[14:03] they believed and kept on believing
[14:06] brother BR said Abraham the Reason God
[14:08] spoke to Abraham God knew that Abraham
[14:12] would take what he got from God and give
[14:14] it to his family now that's what he said
[14:17] you all the great things Abraham
[14:19] done God knew Abraham was going to sit
[14:21] down with his children and say hey this
[14:25] is what happened this is what's going on
[14:27] and then they could take it on down
[14:28] through the generation so let's start
[14:30] with by faith
[14:33] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[14:36] sacrifice than came by which he obtained
[14:37] witness that he was
[14:39] righteous God testifying of his
[14:42] gift of his
[14:45] gifts and by it he being dead yet
[14:49] speaketh all right we're just going to
[14:51] kind of run through a few of these make
[14:53] a few more comments by faith Enoch was
[14:57] translated that's like the brother said
[14:59] the other
[15:01] night
[15:03] Enoch pleased God in the Old Testament
[15:07] didn't say a thing about him being
[15:09] translated he said God took him but Paul
[15:14] having the inward holy ghost that was
[15:16] there with
[15:17] Enoch right same one that was right
[15:21] there with
[15:22] Enoch comes over here in Hebrews and
[15:25] says it was translated in other words he
[15:28] was changed and taken up right that he
[15:32] should not see death and was not found
[15:36] because God had translated him for
[15:38] before his translation he had this
[15:41] testimony that he pleased
[15:43] God right but in Genesis just said Enoch
[15:46] walk with God and was
[15:48] not that was it now how you going to
[15:51] read into all
[15:53] that you got to have somebody come and
[15:55] break it down for you Paul came and
[15:58] broke it down down and said it was
[16:00] translated that he should not see death
[16:03] but without faith it is
[16:06] impossible okay without the Holy Ghost
[16:08] it's impossible to please
[16:11] God why cuz you're contrary that's right
[16:16] your nature is contrary you were born
[16:18] contrary to God that's right you were
[16:21] born contrary to his perfect will you
[16:24] were born contrary to his nature that's
[16:26] what we're talking about that's why
[16:27] these things cuz the things that we have
[16:29] in normal that's why brother R said a
[16:31] lot of these virtues people have them
[16:33] out there why because it's just in the
[16:35] nature part of of people to have P some
[16:38] people have a lot of patience some do
[16:39] not but once you become a Christian you
[16:42] can't fall back on that excuse and say
[16:44] well I didn't have Temperance then so
[16:46] I'm not going to have Temperance now now
[16:48] that's uhuh that's a cop out and God
[16:51] will not accept
[16:55] that one more time once you become a
[17:00] Christian once you become a Christian
[17:02] those are
[17:03] requirements not something that you say
[17:06] well that's just not my
[17:07] nature everybody understand
[17:10] that though being contrary a lot of that
[17:14] contrary still you must have these
[17:17] virtues to be sealed in by the Holy
[17:20] Ghost and to receive an adoption when
[17:24] you come to a
[17:25] position requirements that's right not
[17:28] well I I'm I didn't have patience before
[17:31] and I ain't got a whole lot
[17:34] now okay maybe so but it's required that
[17:37] you have
[17:38] patience but the Holy Ghost has
[17:42] patience everybody understand where I'm
[17:44] going with this it's not something out
[17:45] there you got to get right it's right
[17:49] here and you're the one that keeps it
[17:51] encapsulated or are are um in a Cell
[17:55] jail cell keep keep the you keep it keep
[17:59] the door closed you keep the door
[18:01] closed
[18:04] right but the goods in
[18:08] there you're the one free moreal
[18:10] agency go back to free moreal agency
[18:13] you're the one that can s okay God I've
[18:15] never had patience in my life with
[18:17] nobody but God you promise me that's
[18:20] promise you promis me that if you give
[18:22] me the new birth that that is in there
[18:25] and if it's a requirement you know what
[18:27] you're going to have to tell God God
[18:28] you're going to have to do it but God
[18:30] I'm going to allow you to do it you oh
[18:33] allow God yeah that's goes back to fre
[18:35] more agency you allow God to get in that
[18:38] door that's right but see God knows that
[18:43] if you're
[18:44] stubborn you're not going to have
[18:46] patience so guess what Temperance is
[18:48] where you're going to stop
[18:50] at and you're going to have to go by the
[18:53] grave die before the Rapture takes place
[18:56] that's just sorry that's just the way it
[18:57] is
[18:59] the only people's going to take a body
[19:00] change is going to have that headstone
[19:01] of love that's right cuz I believe
[19:04] brother Brown had that headstone of love
[19:06] and he still died so there's going to be
[19:08] a group of people that's got to have
[19:10] that so totally in them of course we
[19:12] know why brother rown had to go off the
[19:14] scene uh he couldn't be here because the
[19:17] of the uh next coming of
[19:20] Elijah two two Elijah you know you
[19:23] understand he's the fourth coming of
[19:24] Elijah and he had to go off the scene so
[19:26] the fifth coming of Elijah could come
[19:28] the Jew so he knew his time was
[19:31] short but you and I don't have I mean we
[19:33] don't have to worry about having an
[19:34] Elijah anointing or or being Elijah
[19:36] that's right we're a bride that says
[19:38] that we'll be changed in a moment 20 of
[19:40] the night right but you get the Holy
[19:42] Ghost and you got an automatic change
[19:44] change starts here then it works its way
[19:47] out that way you got a question I was
[19:49] just say I was just thinking if we know
[19:53] to say I know I have a problem with
[19:55] temper to say that I mean shouldn't we
[19:58] exercise our try to try to daily
[20:01] exercise like our self will I mean
[20:04] control to yes so it comes automatically
[20:08] we shouldn't just sit around and wait
[20:09] for that magic to appear and we should
[20:13] that's what I mean about about having to
[20:14] go get something you don't have to go
[20:16] get something it's already
[20:18] there you've got to
[20:21] exercise your
[20:24] faith and you know this kind of
[20:26] borderlines and I want to make this
[20:28] point real quick CU I got to go hook up
[20:30] brother George um this borderlines on
[20:35] the power of positive
[20:37] thinking
[20:38] but if you don't have the power of
[20:41] positive thinking for
[20:44] this see they have the power of positive
[20:46] thinking out there if you got you know
[20:49] you go to these motivational seminars
[20:51] well you know where it comes from it may
[20:53] not come from the word of God the guy
[20:55] may be the biggest sinner in the world
[20:56] but they they have a
[20:59] knowledge that the human body needs a
[21:02] certain kind of positive something to
[21:05] get it
[21:06] motivated okay if they would take the
[21:08] word of God and do that they'd be a lot
[21:11] better off cuz you just motivate a
[21:13] sinner and he's still a
[21:14] center right but you motivate a
[21:18] Christian you motivate a Christian
[21:20] what's going to happen is is
[21:22] everything's going to point back to the
[21:25] word patience is a virtue
[21:28] brother Brown said the first thing you
[21:29] got to have is patience with who
[21:33] god wow patience with your brother nope
[21:36] he said you got to have patience with
[21:38] God that he will do what he said he
[21:42] would
[21:43] do what he said he would do all right so
[21:45] let's read just a few more and then
[21:47] we'll go but without faith it is
[21:49] impossible to please him for he that
[21:52] cometh to God cometh ongoing not just
[21:56] one time he that cometh that God must
[21:58] believe that he is is
[22:01] what all of
[22:03] it God just
[22:06] is he just is he's just he's just all of
[22:09] it he's before after during he he just
[22:12] is right and that he is a
[22:16] rewarder of them that
[22:19] diligently seek Him and there's your
[22:21] answer to your
[22:23] question you can have a
[22:25] spirit of of
[22:31] temperance and never be able to break
[22:33] that unless you ask God to break
[22:38] it you got a temper brother R said you
[22:41] still now remember even getting the Holy
[22:43] Ghost you're going to have a temper
[22:45] okay you got have a
[22:47] temper but it's how you make that temper
[22:51] act I said
[22:54] you make that temper
[22:56] act you have to to be real
[22:58] careful because it really is the power
[23:01] of positive thinking but you got to be
[23:03] positive on on faith faith to me is the
[23:05] most positive of positive of
[23:07] positive Faith cuz it's the substance of
[23:10] things hoped for the evidence of
[23:12] something you can't even see show me
[23:14] your Holy Ghost take it out and show it
[23:16] to
[23:17] me I see it by the reflection of what's
[23:20] on the outside to know whether you have
[23:23] it or not okay and you can fake it
[23:25] enough that's right
[23:28] you can than it enough to a point that's
[23:31] right these people that are going off
[23:33] you know these these Bel well they're
[23:35] not Believers but they believe in
[23:36] something but these people that are
[23:38] going off and going out come leaving the
[23:40] message and saying it's wrong and this
[23:42] that and the other they never had Faith
[23:44] they never had the baptism of the Holy
[23:48] Ghost CU brother R said you're contrary
[23:51] to the word until you get the Holy Ghost
[23:53] right you see why I'm not contrary to
[23:55] the
[23:56] word clud called me the other day and
[23:59] he's doing a great thing out there he's
[24:02] showing in the
[24:03] Bible listen to me now he's showing in
[24:06] the Bible the flaws of the Old Testament
[24:09] people but even the flaws of the New
[24:11] Testament people he is trying to prove
[24:14] to them people that they don't have the
[24:15] Holy
[24:17] Ghost he's trying to prove how many
[24:19] times has daddy said that he got it from
[24:22] Daddy how many times has daddy said I
[24:25] wished I could preach so hard
[24:28] that you all realize you didn't have the
[24:30] Holy Ghost because you can fake it right
[24:34] you can be an anointed one and be as
[24:37] lost as lost can be that's right but if
[24:39] you can ever find somebody that comes to
[24:42] a point that says God I can't go that
[24:45] way cuz I've got to I'm stopped I can't
[24:47] go that way the preacher has preached me
[24:49] that's what God wants today he's going
[24:50] to preach him in a
[24:51] corner he going to preach them in a
[24:53] corner and see how they get
[24:55] out you say that's pretty rough
[24:58] if it gets the results I wouldn't care
[25:00] what he done if he can get his 40 people
[25:03] to see they're all lost and he can
[25:04] preach the new birth and they all have a
[25:06] Revival and get the Holy Ghost that's
[25:08] what the problem in our churches are
[25:10] because the great people of Ephesus
[25:12] there was 12 people in the whole church
[25:14] all 12 had the new
[25:16] birth what a church to preach
[25:19] to right right I mean what what a great
[25:23] powerful group that's why brother R said
[25:24] it was one of the most powerful churches
[25:26] to ever be
[25:28] 12 people but they all had the Holy
[25:31] Ghost working in their
[25:33] life virtues remember group of Ephesus
[25:36] was a very mature group so they were
[25:40] versed in The Virtue knowledge temper
[25:41] patience because remember Peter was
[25:43] there Paul was there all the ones were
[25:44] there that had these virtues and they
[25:46] were teaching the people so Claus's
[25:48] doing a good thing I think he's doing
[25:49] well he he just said the Lord impressed
[25:51] on me he said I'm going to tell you he
[25:52] said I'm going to prove to you you don't
[25:54] have it you got to prove to me you
[25:56] do
[26:00] you say well boy that would be rough you
[26:02] know what if I found out I didn't have
[26:05] it
[26:07] right and I could then turn and seek
[26:11] it seeking you shall find that's right
[26:14] if I could turn around and seek it then
[26:17] what more the better that's right then
[26:19] for us to go through life like Daddy
[26:20] says go through life thinking we had it
[26:23] and we didn't have it ever pretty tough
[26:27] but by faith read the rest of this and
[26:28] we'll finish up this chapter we need to
[26:30] go so I can put brother que up so Lord
[26:33] bless you have a good week you are let's
[26:37] have
