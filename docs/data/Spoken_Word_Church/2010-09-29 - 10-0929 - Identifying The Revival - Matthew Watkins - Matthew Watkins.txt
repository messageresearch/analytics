right just fine jesus let's all stand back to our feet love the words to that song i want to see the unseen arms right he'll be through my storms i don't know what what kind of life y'all are living but i live a life of a lot of storms a lot of troubles a lot of heartaches times of joy times of victory but man sometimes the the going gets rough and there has to be an unseen arm that holds us through some of the battles we go through we have to say lord all we can do is lean upon you lean upon the everlasting arms of jesus and look to the unseen amen if you have your bibles turn to the book of numbers chapter 33 numbers chapter 33 i'd like to look at a thought here tonight i just praying and waiting on the lord to give me direction for this service i believe that there are many many many good things that you could preach only because the word that we draw from is a deep well that's very rich full of good things good things we could say good things we could preach on good things you might amen say my that was good man brother matt he really said some good things but it's not what we're looking for tonight i've said it before and i'm not ashamed to say it i didn't come to impress anybody tonight i came to impress the lord jesus amen and i just want to say something solomon said that a a word in due season what value can you put on that word and so i just want to say something tonight that would help you and encourage you and just to encourage you and your walk with the lord i i'd like to minister on a thought here identifying the revival identifying the revival we'll look here at numbers chapter 33 and we'll begin looking in the 51st verse just to give you a little background so we don't have to cover too much time this is after the children of israel have came out of egypt and they've come out of egypt into a land which god would show them and they've came through many different things and so much has transpired up until this moment that we're reading about here in verse 51 they come to the river of jordan on this side of jericho and and everything that they had came out for and everything that god had purposed in his mind here they come to the very climax of the reason of why god had brought them out of egypt he did not bring them out of egypt which is a type of the world just to bring them out he didn't bring them out just so that they could wonder just so that they could be bit by fiery serpents and watch this person die and watch phineas come in with the spear all these things that had happened god didn't bring him out for that purpose but he brought him out in his mind this was the reason that we're about to read it this was this was the climax the reason the purpose the mind of god for the entire purpose of why there was an egypt coming out it was to go into what god had promised them and it was their inheritance and god tells moses he says in verse 51 speaking to the children of israel and say unto them when you're past over jordan into the land of canaan then you shall drive out how many the inhabitants of the land now listen to what he says from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land comma and dwell therein so there is a proper order that god wants this to be done by it would be a mistake for them to go over and to dwell and then dispossess right god did not want them to go over and build houses farms put their kids in school get their economy set up and then say hey hit tight jebusite uh i need you to leave because this is my property but god was gonna have a divine order that he would have them do this he didn't say go dwell but he said first you have to take a sword in your hand and drive out the enemies that are on your property and then dwell and he says here in verse 53 you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein now so you notice the colon there here's a promise of god here's the promise for i have given you the land to possess it now here is a promise that they can bake their faith upon they could build a foundation upon this one fact that god promised i've given you this property this is not the hittites though they have houses though they have farms though it looks like there's a civilization here actually they're squatters this is your property right and so god tells them i've promised it it's not an if it's not a maybe i promise he says for i have given you the land to possess it verse 54 you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more you shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance look at verse 55 but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you it's okay i'll wink at it it's no big deal but god why is there a butt i mean i thought this was a promise i i thought you promised you've given it to me so what's what does it really matter what i do you see this was a law of appropriation and we have to be so careful sometimes that we don't mix up things that are unconditional with things that are conditional you see your salvation your your eternal destination if you're sealed into christ is sealed there's no chance that you cannot be an eternity but there's something called the rapture amen of a church what is it i don't know about you but it's my inheritance it's my land it's my property and god tells them this he says but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass so here's a second promise that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them amen judges chapter one one more scripture before you're seated judges chapter one so we find very clear in scripture and i want you to follow this close tonight they have a prophet right they have a promise and they have instructions a prophet promise and instructions what more could they have right right amen and god gives them the order the instructions and a promise and now it's up to them you see this was very different and this is what i what i would like to get to we'll read this first and i'll have you be seated i don't like to preach to you while you're standing uh verse 21 the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin and jerusalem unto this day verse 27 neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of beth sheen and her towns nortanik and her towns will skip the towns because there's a lot of them verse 29 neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that will engage her but the canaanites will engage her among them verse 30 neither did zebulon drive out the inhabitants of catron or the inhabitants of the nahal but the canaanites dwell among them 31 neither did asher 33 neither did nep to lie and it goes on and on and on and on you have to ask yourself the question what happened and anytime you read this passage in numbers and and if you follow the story of the exodus and you think in your mind how many things god had done and brought them from so much and they come to the very climax the very purpose the very thing they had raised their kids in the message for the very reason why they were in the truth and they come up to time to where it's possession time and you look at verse one of chapter two the angel of the lord came up from gilgal to boca and said now listen to this order i made you to go up out of egypt and i had brought you into the land which i swore into your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you and you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice god asked him this question why have you done this why don't we pray and watch the lord for the blessing if you have a special need maybe you can just raise it before the lord and say god here's my cup come and fill it tonight heavenly father we're so glad lord that we can say that not out of form not out of tradition but out of a living reality heavenly father for god truly you've shed your love abroad in our hearts you've given us a thirst and a hunger for your word you've cleaned us from sin and there's so much god that we have that we can be thankful for tonight just the fact that we could come and gather under the revealed word of this day and that you have a pastor here who preaches the uncompromised gospel and you have people lord that pull and love the lord and are striving for a rapture what a blessed church we are today god lord and we're in need of you today we're in need of not the word of man lord we're in need god that lord as as your prophet had told us lord that these people that are here tonight they operate the gift that's in the ministry lord let them understand that they literally control the potential of this service on this wednesday night what will it be god that'll be up to them that'll be up to us on how much liberty we give you to move tonight lord i just want to raise my hands and want to say i surrender may these people raise their hands and just say i surrender god i lay any premonition any ulterior thoughts or any sleepiness or tiredness or plans for tomorrow i lay them down god and i say this is your time heavenly father we give you liberty we give you freedom lord i pray god that you would come and do the impossible tonight god may you come and move by your spirit lord we ask in jesus christ's name amen you could have your seats tonight so without going into too much detail of this what we're looking at because i want to make sure we stay on the main focus of this stall and i'd like to just look at this here identifying the revival and you see here in in the book of exodus and throughout numbers and you find this this events the the the exodus out of egypt and here god had been doing and i want you just to notice a few things god had been doing so much for the children of israel they come out of egypt and god tells them here in judges chapter two he says i made you to go out of egypt he doesn't say you did anything he doesn't say you wanted to necessarily that you did love your own accord but he says i made you come out of egypt i hardened pharaoh's heart and they they learned this god of doing everything for the my they got a prophet before him and and the red seas are opening up and man is falling from heaven he feeds on me clothes to me dresses them he gives them quail in the morning and so many things are happening and god's just moving and they're learning this god that just does everything for them and he fights their battles and they don't really have to do anything and all they really ever do is complain anyways and here they come up to the climax and god is done and done and done and done and did for them and did for them and did for and here they come to the very river of jordan and here's the climax and they say my this is what was sworn unto my father abraham this is what was sworn unto my fathers there would be a promise of this there would be a promise of a rapture of the church and there would be a people who put on immortality and a church that wouldn't have spot or wrinkle and everything that has been promised everything we've been waiting for what we've staked our lives for and grown our families and built our churches upon and here comes the very moment of truth for the children of israel and god turns on them in a way and says look i've done for you this far but now it's time to put action to your face and if you want canaan you got to go get it because there's a genusite who has children who has families who have homes and who has weapons and you've got to take your faith and the sword of the word and go and cut his head off right amen and so you see that come over in egypt and and my so many things happen and we could identify the revival that started right at the coming out of egypt and my revival fire is so so so so so awesome among them and miracles are taking place and you look at this revival if you study just the revival of them and then how it comes to the very moment and right you're right when you think that so much potential for them to to take the promises of god and they come to the very moment and this is what happens they go over and they don't get complete victory manasseh and ephraim doesn't drive out the k he drives out the inhabitants of the mountain but he couldn't get victory in the valley because they had ontario and manasseh couldn't do this and ephraim couldn't do this and you're thinking how in the world does this happen to a promise elect but refer to a promised group of people who have instructions clear-cut instructions they have a promise they have they have a prophet to tell them what to do how to live how you're to operate when you get over there and they come to this very moment and they squander their opportunities and the revival that started and looks so good ends in death you see the bible tells us and god god we don't have to pick it up here in judges chapter two but if you keep reading the bible says that god made this promise if you don't drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain in your life will become pricks in your eyes thorns in your side and shall vex you in that land now it never affects ephraim personally it never affects manasseh personally or any of them personally but who does it affect the generation that rises because the bible says ephraim and ass and the rest of them are buried with their fathers but the bible tells us in judges chapter 2 it says also that generation gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel and the children of israel did evil on the side of the lord and served balaam they forsook now this is easy for us to read friends it's really easy for us to look at our studying oh my that's terrible but these were message kids these were moms and dads who hadn't my mom's had long hair dads who didn't smoke and didn't drink and went to church this was real families and here was their children who they had raised thought they had raised correctly but because of incomplete victory in mom and dad's life the bible says the children of israel did evil inside of the lord and served balaam they forsook the lord god of their fathers it didn't say they forsook gods they didn't say they stopped being religious oh they kept going to church but they served balaam yeah sure and he says and which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods or the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord to anger and the lord fors and they forsook the lord and served bella and astra now this is this is so amazing and we got we got to take a hard corner here and i pray that you'll just follow me in this to lay a little bit of groundwork but we see that this was the revival of egypt the revival i'm sorry of the children of israel and we see how it what we watch it and it starts out good and the revival time comes around and it comes to the very climax like we've said and then it ends and it dies that raises up a generation and then judges reign over israel and we know what comes through back through in jeremiah and the different prophets but i'd like to just look at this brother branham says that he found a keystone in the bible oh yeah and he said that it's the revelation that god never changes his ways are as unchangeable as he is right brother branham said that was the keystone that unlocked the bible we know what a keystone is in an arch if you don't have the top keystone the interaction fall apart right brother branham said it was this that jesus christ is the same yesterday amen today and forever solomon says i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and he says that which has been is now and that which is to be has already been and god requireth that which is passed brother branham takes those two scriptures out of out of the book of hebrews in the book of ecclesiastes and he says this is the keystone that unlocks the bible right that god does not change amen have we heard that too much you see we live in a very changing world we live in a world that constantly morphs constantly grows constantly changes things get worse times get worse times get harder word gets more wicked but god doesn't change that's right and then you see here brother adam says in the ephesian church age here it is and i'm changing god with unchanging ways now listen to this what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until this last time there will never be a change what god did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages now we don't want us we don't i know i know you're very well taught here we don't need to go down and look at it very close but we all know what the first church age was right we all know what the first church was brother branham said it was a seed and we know that it was brother type there's the the bride tree in other places these types that is the wheat plant the seed that goes into the ground it dies but it brings back fourth seven church ages it's restored through messengers until you come to the very last age and god would bring forth the seed a continuation of the seed that goes in the ground but the seed that comes out at the top would have to look the same act the same be not the same or to be a continuation of what went in the ground right and brother branham says here it is and then changing god there will never be a change what god did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the holy spirit how the first or original church was founded now we're going to deal a lot with this ephesian church age i want you to look at how significant the first was heard a man say the other brother say the other day that god made he said i want to get this correct until he says that he said when god made his first church when god created it and built his first church he made it how he wanted it and now he wants his last church to be how his first church was and brother branham says he knows the word can't change or be changed because it's the word of god thus now listen what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what scholars say god has not changed that pattern now don't think azusa street 1906 that's not pentecost pentecost was what happened on the day of pentecost in the book of acts when an ephesian church is that right amen that is the standard that is the pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until they close those scholars may tell you that the apostolic age is over don't believe it as long as men are being called and sent forth with the word of life there's an apostolic age going on now listen secondly they referred to an age and he puts this in quotes manifested holy ghost power as being over since the bible has been completed brother branham gives a very simple answer that is untrue right amen we're in a message church why would you feel the need to preach that well friends i think you would be surprised i preached to the church here not too long ago had no clue get outside and find out by the pastor the church believes that there is no such thing this is a message church there is no such thing as the holy ghost baptism communion foot washing we are in the bride age now there is no more church ages they have been closed we don't receive the holy ghost like they did in the book of acts it is totally different you're born with a seed come on brother now you know why a prophet would say though they tell you the apostolic age is over don't believe it amen that is not true he says then peter said unto them repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins for the promise of power i love how brother brandon says this of which with the apostles were endued with at pentecost is to you the jews your children the jews to them that are afar off us the gentiles until he stops calling the pentecostal message and power will not cease can i get an amen time what the church had i love that it means possessed at pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost let me tell you something friends this is not just ink on paper this is your inheritance in the holy ghost this is my promise your promise if you're a child of god tonight this is your canaan this is your land don't let a devil keep you from the power of the spirit of god manifested in the church is the oxygen to the church and when we lose the power of the spirit we've choked the church what is the devil attacking let me get to this real real quick what is the devil attacking in our day today is he attacking how theological our ministers are how much we know the message is he attacking how well we preach or teach or how much we wave our hands and yell no friends he's attacking the power of the spirit moving and having freedom in your life what is the devil going to attack in this church brother branham said the end the book of revelation identifies how the antichrist spirit would come into the church defiling it making it lukewarm formal gold where is the onslaught of the devil in our churches today destroying the oxygen to the church amen and he says what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right amen originally she had the power of god in the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost the original church was not organized by men it was led by the holy ghost wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to god it stayed with the original word what does that tell me friends that tells me that you are not part of you say i'm a message believer what does that mean it does not mean that you are part of a movement that started in 1947 and ended in 1965 you're not part of a uh some kind of club or some kind of movement but you're part of the very book of acts church the book of acts the church of god the pentecostal church that started in the bible in the book of acts that is that my roots can trace all the way back to there i'm part of that family of god that's why we sing i am one of them exactly i'm a believer are you believers tonight that is what the church had it stayed with the original true church the true church are we the true church tonight we'll always try to be like the original at pentecost the true church would today will try to approximate that early first one right now so we see how important it was how much how much significance was put on all the ages and all the churches but specifically to the first and to the last the alpha and the omega the seed that goes into the ground and dies and the seed that's harvested and the combine picks it up and raptures the church there's a lot of importance there but i'd like you just to look here for a minute and i'm going to slow down but i'd like you just to look here for a minute at that ephesian church if there was so much importance to their revival and what took place and what happened and how brother branham said that was the first pattern that was the standard if a church claims to be a true church they will have to come to their portion in every age of that pattern and we know that martin couldn't come to it luther john wesley couldn't they could come to a portion of it still believing in the trinity still smoking a pipe but if they came to their portion of the pattern for their day they were identified as true church but today we don't just have a portion and measure we have the fullness the restoration of the bride tree but we see here in the ephesian church age now listen to this is the pattern this is the standard and let's look at their revival nevertheless i have somewhat against me because thou has left now notice it doesn't say thou has lost right but it says thou has left god didn't go anywhere but thou has left thy first love to understand this brother branham says you must realize now just pitch your attention tonight i apologize i have quotes a lot of them to read i know sometimes in this this age of video and everything's channel has to be tantalizing and entertaining if you go to read a quote people go to sleep on you so just hold your attention here tonight i'm going to read a few of them just listen close to the words you believe their life don't you i don't understand this you must realize brother adam says the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of ephesus alone now listen to what brother branham says some of these key words history keeps repeating itself just think of that in your mind history keeps repeating right in the generation of israel we see a revival and one generation only to see the fires fading in the next and in the third generation embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of the original flame right now that's what we read about in the book of numbers the first generation comes out of egypt fire is burning second generation comes on embers may be glowing slightly then by the third and fourth there's no vestige they forsook god they pursue the god of their fathers they're serving other gods brother brandon says that history if you look in the bible we don't want to go through every single one my friends you could go through every single one of the revivals the revival that started the eden it ended and started in life and then death starts with seth the children of seth ends in nimrod power of bible and you look at all these things the revival starts in life ends in death starts in life ends in death the ephesian church age brother branham says history keeps repeating itself he says and then he says then in the fourth generation there may be no vestige whatsoever of the original flame and then god lights the fire right again and the same process is repeated right it is simply the manifestation god has no grandchildren amen salvation is not passed by a natural birth it isn't in the word he says you start out with a truly born again believer truly born again sealed by the holy ghost and he says that when the next generation comes along they're not just christians born again christians but now they've taken a denominational name their baptist methodist that's exactly what they are they're not christians you have to be born of the will of god not the will of man to be saved what does brother brandon say history keeps repeating itself in one generation we see revival here only to see the fires fading in the next and the neighbors may be glowing slightly and then god lights the fire again it lights up it goes dimmer dimmer dimmer dies he likes it again the same process and brother random stops and says what is it it's simply this manifestation god has no grandchildren let that sink in believers god has no grandchildren it does not save your children to be a message church or a message home or to have a picture of brother adam in your house there is no grandchildren what is that telling us revival is not sustained within the revival right just because there was a revival does not inherit or give you this truth that every generation that comes up and grows in that revival will take will be enough will be part of the same revival listen to me friends unless the generations that keep going on as time goes on come to the same fiery baptism experience that started your revival they will die unless our children come to the same holy ghost not a different holy ghost not a different way not a different kind of osmosis where we just listen and we believe and we're slowly assimilate and assimilate the word and if we get them around enough church and get them to preachers and get them to pastor listen friends we must have the fire the baptism of the holy ghost in our homes and our children in our churches that is what is necessary for this revival to continue amen because just message message church message turn profit god sent a prophet third pull those things will not sustain your kids amen brother branham says these are not christians you have to be born of the will of god not the will of man to be saved but these folks are coming together now brother branham says and he begins to look at the ephesian church age they're not the same anymore right what happened we got our pattern we get our standard happen in ephesus something powerful happened in the book of acts what do you mean something happened god what would you have against that church they're not the same anymore right yeah he says the first desire to please god i want these just to sink in the fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it's cooled off and became formal that is what was happening to these ephesians they were getting formal what the pattern the standard no no no he is that wrong that was the smurf it wasn't the ephesian church yet surely not no the pattern the standard what god did in the first church he has to keep on doing that same church that started in the book of acts eventually became the of the book of revelation amen and jesus said the kingdom of heaven is liken unto a mustard seed brother adam picks it up and said it was the mustard seed church sprouts forth instantly adds numbers overnight but brother branham said it only walked in purity for such a little short time and eventually becomes the tree of every fowl and clean and hateful about it what happened to their revival right and he says they were getting formal he says that second generation the abandonment of god was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what god thought of them as they begin to be careful about what the world thought and that second generation coming on was just like israel they demanded a king to be like other nations and when they did that they rejected god amen listen to me when they did many things wrong but when they demanded a king brother branham said they rejected god right there listen to me friends i hope this is okay to preach here tonight but in the message you see it came out in the infancy so many people were caught up in the truth of the doctrines and the truth of a revelation of a message and god sending a prophet but what happened to so many people's homes you watched people crown ministries and pastors and personalities and they were chasing charisma and big churches and they uprooted families and homes and moved here and moved there all white chasing a king how did the men do this no but the people crowned kings in the message and they chased after men and big names and big preachers and big personalities and i'm all for respecting the men of god but listen to me church anytime you bank your children's souls and your marriage and your home and you say i'm just gonna go to a pastor and he's obligated to fix my children fix my marriage if my children don't get the holy ghost then it's his listen to me friend it was never the job of a pastor to save your kids or to save your marriage or your finances it must be moms and dads and homes that say we will be baptized with the holy ghost we will seek the holy ghost for our children amen right and the ministry is only there to assist you and to edify you as a body but you must have your church at home right right now what happened to church at home what happened to worship at whom when children the message the only worship they see is at church what is wrong with that children of israel god of all the feasts that they had god only required that they kept three all three feasts god required were not done at church but at home and now we see families there's no church at home there's no sanctification at home right and it's all just gather around the pulpit and we'll change there and that's why when you have problems in your home than in your kids who do you blame the pastor oh yeah my two churches bling and you watch people uproot families and crown kings and personalities and they pray for me preach for me study for me do everything for me pastor because i've moved here and you watch people and they move to these churches and they put so much confidence in that man when that man did what was normal for a man and that is to make mistakes they left the man and they chased other men and other men and then finally when they've ran out of kings they amen and brother branham says when they did that they rejected god right that's right but they did it anyway that is the history of the church oh no that's oh well that's their history that's not our history no this is your history that is the history of the family of god history keeps repeating itself when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long until you see them now listen to what happens because i'm preaching to you tonight on identifying the revival and we see revival starts out in ephesus starts out so good slowly time goes on and it begins to die now what are some of the things we're to look for brother branham if you're going to explain to us how history keeps repeating itself and processes being repeated what are some of the things we look for to know when these things are taking place brother branham says it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do amen and they start doing things they wouldn't do initially they stop doing things that they used to do and they bring things into homes that they originally kicked out and they bring things into worship that they would have never done initially but somehow since time has gone on god's standards lower as time gets darker amen but you see that's not god though time goes longer and though the age gets darker god doesn't change those kind of things you know you sort of got it you sort of got to be careful brother matt because the age is so dark and if you if you try to preach that old hole in his standard like we used to boy you'll just kick you or run everybody out of the church don't you know all age now dark the ages yeah i know how dark the age is but i know how powerful my god is and i know how much the blood of jesus christ can do to an individual because he changed my entire life and if he can do it for me ten years ago he can do it for any young person old person middle-aged person he's the same yesterday today and forever brother branham says they change they stop doing things that they used to do and they start doing things they wouldn't do initially they change their manner of dress i better duck when i'm preaching these things here now i'll just preach it from down here okay he says they changed their manner of dress now listen their attitudes and their behavior yeah right now brother branham now hold on a minute you're going to tell us what it looks like when a revival is dying surely brother vernon you mean to say that they're preachers they they get dumb they get dumber right they're not preaching as powerful and their theology slips and they forget certain things and we don't have money anymore in the bank account those are the things that that that you can tell that a revival is dying right brother branham no they change their manner of dress now friends this is his words not my words they change their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior now we could spend three sermons on dress attitude and behavior we're not going to tonight because this is a wednesday night we got to get you out of here early but brother branham says they change their manner of dress and friend i don't have to spend too much time preaching for you to realize that's changing in the message used to be you used to be able to spot a sister from a mile away in walmart he says no that's a believer their holiness pentecostal or they're a believer one or the other you go talk to him where you go to church all these that and the other but now you can't tell our sister's hardly apart from a hippie and our brothers and our sisters and my the way we dress he said brother matt why is that important isn't just important that we love god well it's it really doesn't matter what i think is important or what you think but it's what god thinks and he says they changed their manner of dress you see used to there was a reality in the church used to our sisters didn't cut their hair because it was a revelation to their soul not a form that they lived by that's why now we've defined trimming is different from cutting now it's amazing how we can do these sort of kind of things when webster himself would laugh at us since when is trimming not cutting and i've said this before what if i was to take a rope here tonight i was going to hang it down to be 10 inches long and i was to cut it halfway you'd say you cut it what did i do to it did i cut it yet you cut it but what if i was just to take that rope and i was only to cut just a 16th of an inch did i cut it you'd say yeah you cut it it seems pretty simple to me i don't know about you what was the reason do we say these things to beat people up or to hit them on that no that's not why we say them we say them to let our sisters know this was what god looked at when moses seen the pattern and god said build it exactly as you see that pattern this is what i wanted bride to look like this is how i want a bride to live this is what's in my heart and the wife becomes the expression of what's in the husband's mind amen and brother branham says they changed their manner of dress it used to be that our brothers didn't wear shorts and it didn't matter if they were in hawaii on vacation either oh my but you look at all these kind of things and we could preach on a hundred of them but what is the point brother matt that you look at these signs brother branham said this is when you know death is in the revival corruption has set in we could preach all night on the revival of a nation the revile of an age of our loving church but let's preach on the revival of me let's identify our revival they change their manner of dress their attitudes see brother branham says this the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass so when we see promises not coming to pass in our church we know our attitudes must be wrong we live in a generation a nation you just take this nation for example we live in a nation that can be defined as this they do not want correction you live in a world that hates correction hates dignities hates authority we live in a society where young people walk around they have no respect for the owner they have no respect for authority and just a brother and call it total parent delinquency and you live in a nation that doesn't want to be corrected but it comes into the church now it's less and less popular for a person to get up a minister to bring the gospel and preach a corrective sermon without people folding their arms getting up and walking out brother branham said he said their attitudes changed the bible says the son that receiveth not correction is a bastard child i say receiving correction what does that mean israel is not is receiving correction brother matt when we say a man to corrective preaching or we say that's the truth or we agree with it no friend you're no different than the person who folds his arms and walks out receiving correction is not agreeing when the correction comes when you receive correction is when your life can be corrected by the word it's when you change that's the child who receives correction is the child who the word of god can correct their thinking can correct their way i say god correct my thinking if it's wrong correct my life if it's going in the wrong direction correct my home correct my family lord i want to be recorrected not to say gee dad you're right that's right i agree with that but to say god change me from the inside make me a new creation change my desire dear god that's a child who receives correction but the writing says in their behavior they get lacks that is what ephesus means relaxed and drifting and listen to this next sentence that cycle of revival and death has never failed right right history keeps repeating itself that cycle of revival and then death is never found all you have to do is recall this last move of god when men and women went to church dressed like christians prayed all night ouch prayed all night took the street corners they were not ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit they left their old dead churches they worshipped in homes and store buildings but they had reality i say god send the reality back if that's what we lost give me reality again say like david i thirst not a for a dead god but i thirst for the living god and he says they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they began to read books that weren't fit to read they put in the choir instead of singing unto god for themselves they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over yeah right the cry of joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone all they kept on with the form but the fire had died right the blackness of ashes is about all that was left ephesus you did run well right right what hindered you but the brandon says history tells us that eventually there was not one christian left just a small squalid village of unbelievers the pattern the standard the original church what happened to you and your revival it looks so great it looks so promising so much potential but what took place and your revival ephesus brother branham comes here 1957. but you read him before that 1946 49 and 1950 christ the killer the kinsmen redeemer he comes to the end of services pentecost this is it we have what it takes for a rapture praise god hallelujah tape goes off and you hear that over and over and over but then he comes later on in time you see brother branham was born and he comes in the middle of a pentecostal azusa street revival it was not the restoration of pentecost and brother branham begins to think this is it this is the long-awaited restoration but then brother adam comes now listen to this to the seven church ages i'm gonna sit you people down in these other churches listen to me you're in a lukewarm age you're evangelists are crossing the earth preaching things like that you get nowhere you're hollering you baptist or hollering a million more in 44 but what if you got when you got them just a bunch of sinners come in and put their names on a book say they belong to a baptist church not only that but you have methodist candlelights the whole group just as formal and indifferent billy graham told me that he had 30 000 converts and in six weeks he couldn't find 30. why brother brandon says why is that because they never got anything to start with they were just a bunch of sinners when they put their name on a book under under the spell of a revival right mine when i saw i read that about shook me to death under the spell come to the altar repent of your sins repeat after me christ died for my sins my works are filthy right and they repeat this prayer and brother branham said what were they under a trance under a spell not of a witch doctor not of witchcraft but of a real revival under the spell of a revival you see friends our message brought a spell when god brings something great and a revival strikes the earth it brings a spell and what did you have people doing following on the words of a man 1977 i don't see how it could go past that and they were in a trance they were in a spell and they believed and followed that spell until 1977 the spell broke and where are they today they never got anything to start with and he says this is heavenly i want you to listen queen of sheba listen to what brother adam says it's been very strange in our homelands to see brother branham says it certainly has alarmed my emotions to see of the coldness and the indifference that the church is becoming a few years ago and brother adam goes back in his memory a few years ago we had a meeting tinsel was all over the meeting and people gathered to places where the newspaper had a report of people driving as many as 3 000 miles by a taxi cab just to be in the presence of the outpouring of the spirit oh yeah people drove 3 000 miles in a taxicab right to be in the presence of god right right and brother branham says and tonight 1957 queen of sheba tonight after much advertisement trying to cooperate with everybody showing the same spirit that we did when we first came yet it's hard to get a little group of people to smeal to fill a little small arena like this then you could wonder why a minister's heart is alarmed yeah tommy osborne told me my ministry if i come in tokyo this coming summer he'd expected at least two or three million converts the ministry the lord has given me seemed like it went over the head of the educated people but in the lands where they believe that god is real you see here in america we accept him with a mental conception but they over there have a reality and when they see it that settles it and tens of thousands swung to christ in one article and the same message with the same effort that we put forth and maybe 200 people or 300 whatever would be here tonight or maybe five or six people might come to christ where the same effort across the sea would bring a hundred thousand to christ right notice what he starts seeing a few years ago what's happened you see what happened was revival cycle was good it looked good pentecost was it my people were driving everywhere from meetings there was such a fire such a zeal such a passion there was such a reality and then after just a short little time brother brandon begins to recall in his minute memory what happened to all these people he says but tonight tonight 200 people where's everybody at or maybe five or six people would come to christ now listen to me friends don't let this shock you but here in 2010 in this service maybe nobody not one person and brother branham says see that's the difference the revival has left our country yeah we might as well just face it or maybe nobody will come to christ brother branham says you watch that church stop doing things they used to do and they start doing things they didn't do initially let me tell you what has been lost in the christian message church the desire and the burden for lost souls oh that's just cornbread and milk preaching brother matt that's just old foul who you know that's the you need to get out your seals but bruh matt read something deep what's happened to the burden of the lost friends can we not shake ourselves where tonight nobody not one sinner is sitting in this building our churches used to be grown by members by people what was our growth based upon years ago by a sinner coming to repentance at an altar under the conviction of the preached word and having his eyes open to the truth but tonight where does growth come in message churches growth is now the family who gets upset at the pastor or the deacon's daughter and so they uproot their family and they move to this other church in this church and this family moves to here and adhering to here to hear oh we've grown our churches grown have we really grown oh friends i hope you don't mistake me it's just passion tonight where is our burden for the loss what about the man who doesn't know god the woman who needs god we are the arms we are the eyes we are the body of christ we should have something bodily from inside of us to where we're not ashamed to tell people of the gospel amen where sinners would fill up our churches and not just believers who've heard the gospel over and over and over the revival has cooling he says we might as well just face it it's a pitiful sight but why does this happen friend it's because this condition has to come there's an atomic bomb laying on her to settle the difference what do you mean brother this condition no no no no no wait the rapture of the church is at the condition of the it's going to be greater the condition of the churches there's going to be thousands of people and we'll be adding members and knocking out walls building new churches missionary effort everywhere mine there will be such a fire everybody will have their lives free of sin and there won't be anybody falling away and everybody will be perfect that's the rapture condition right no this condition of coldness falling away ministers who used to preach the gospel fallen into adultery pastors falling into homosexuality brother matt that yes that that shakes me that scares me it shouldn't it shouldn't scare us it shouldn't worry us this condition must come but there's a bride who will have the fire of the holy ghost who won't get cold and won't get turned up but will stand for the uncompromised gospel of jesus christ and whose lives will be passionate and be full of zeal for the hour i said god i'm one of them lord glory brother says this condition must come it's because he says his judgments is just the hour there's nothing that will stop it all the preaching i can do all the resurrection that christ could show everything we'll never stop it right right amen but here's what we're responsible for giving a voice against it that it's wrong he says i could never stop these ladies from wearing old vulgar clothes you couldn't stop them brother adam it's the nature of them they've already seen it they were the devil presented that they were subject to it i could never stop men from drinking what is brother brandon saying friends if a ministry of a prophet to this age could not change people's lives just by his preaching then brother samuels by the way none of us none of our ministry can do it unless we have willing vessels who can say god change me by the preaching of your word unless we have people who surrender their lives to the ministry it's the nature in film when you see a person who can never change and they come to church and you preach to them on their dress and preach them on their clothing on their hair and how they live and all these kind of things and they hear it over and over and over and over change oh they just need to mature they just need to be adopted listen friends they need the baptism of the holy ghost they need a birth they need a ceiling where all things are passed away behold all things become new that's what our church needs that's what our children needs we need to understand as parents if our children are sinners they are dead right and unless god breathes life into them all that all that now all the bringing them to church unless they see a token life on display a blood that pleads for them a mom and dad who stays on their knees and prays for them and holds the blood banner the uncompromised holiness gospel before their lives oh god just help us tonight lord amen brother branham says i can never stop but i can never stop men from drinking i could never make the church spiritual all the preaching i would do would never make it spiritual but daryl oh i love this there will be one and that one's a fish god wants him in the kingdom i'll give my voice i don't know who it is but i'll preach it and as i preach he'll hear for all the father hath given me will come to me oh the father had given will come i'm so glad there was a minister who didn't stop preaching who continued to plead and continue to preach the gospel because i was one who heeded the word and said being unto me god according to your word i said i'm coming again that's right listen to me friend what happened to this revival something that started out so good and i'm closing just here in a minute you look at pentecost they did run well it looked so promising my movement was happening the holy ghost was moving and then it comes to this point what's wrong with the church it's alarming my soul i see the coldness and the indifference the church is becoming more cold it's harder to get people to come to church period let alone when they get there to participate in the service and into worship then the song leader has to pump them up raise your hands close your eyes say a prayer and it's not people who are inspired themselves they depend upon ministers to inspire them how backwards is this right from when paul said when all come together all participate in spiritual worship and hymns and singings that church begins to die and brother branham comes to a message door to the heart 1963 three services before he preaches the opening of the seals just before the opening of the seals brother brannon comes with this message door to the heart and he says you look at the coldness you see the indifference you see the the coldness that's in the church and the holy ghost doesn't move anymore brother branham says why what is it the revival is over right now you have a prophet messenger standing upon the earth and he declares to the pentecostal revival the shock right it's dead right it's over and all hope seemed lost mine what are we going to do it's over it's done with all hope is lost could this be i'm not sure but could could we be preaching now to souls that are in prison right amen and all hope seem lost and then brother branham comes little did they know that as the day that a revival was coming to a close there would be a messenger and john the bible says in the book of revelation chapter 5 john wept because he looked on heaven all under heaven and in the earth and nobody was found worthy but the elder said to me weep not john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed and he is worthy and brother branham stands in the breach and he says maybe it's just me feeling this way but let him come and take this book or forever hold his peace and listen to me friends he came and took the book and a revival started again amen and there was a new truth and a new message and a seed had been restored right and the shot pulled away and was dead but there was new life again amen and that's me and that is that you tonight friends is that your revival tonight there is a reality to that revival that i am a believer of present day truman i earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints but what's happened all right brother adam comes to recognizing your day and his message voice herod of his coming or voice of hillary forget which publication he says they're saying fast pray fast pray not too late for revival yet brother brandon says why are they doing that they haven't recognized the awakening right or the revival of the bride five stars lined up for the venom says what is it signify a bride a bride god has a church without spot or wrinkle jesus said in revelations chapter 3 to him that overcometh that means what for the man there will be somebody who overcomes this world i just want to believe that's me god when he said to him that overcometh he was saying to me i'll grant to sit with me on my throne as i also overcame and i'm set down with my father on his throne and that was a reality that's why there's a church here in lula georgia that's why there's a church because revival might have died but a new cycle i began and what happened now that you see our revival and you see manner of dress changing attitudes changing people getting cold ministers falling away church is falling apart crumbling no one can get the victory anymore then it comes really close and down to home oh yeah by the random comes i'll close on this one point brother adam comes to the seventh seal and he begins to list he begins to list the third pull and he says you know there was he says all these things happen he says there was that little baby shoe he says and i was trying to take that one inch thread through a little quarter inch island and it was saying you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things and there was that fishing pole the rainbow trout he said i was sitting there throwing it they were saying you can do it bill you can do it he said that jerk the line and you ever you any of you fishermen know if you ever use the baitcaster rod and ever you throw it too far and you don't get that thumb stop in time boy it can backlash on you brother branham said it backlashed all over where it was like spaghetti and he said in that angel that boy stepped in front of me and said i told you don't get your line tangled in these kind of times brother adam says then he says oh i'm so stupid lord forgive me god i'm such a dummy please forgive me lord and he says then there was that tent or auditorium or something now we're not afraid of this are we tonight we know what men have made it and what theology and what what men probing and wondering and speculating has made it but he said there was that tent or auditorium or something and he says and i was called away i was looking down you got one big problem if you believe in a return ministry brother branham says i was caught away he wasn't even there what does that tell me that he's seeing something that will happen after he's gone right yeah now let's identify our revival brother brandon says i'm looking at a tent or something and there's people gathered everywhere and he says all under this great big old tent and he says and the voice told me brother madam says inside this tent there was a little wooded room a little room made out of wood and brother adam says that the angel told me he says this is the third pool and he says and i'll meet you in there and it won't be a public show right i'll meet you in there and it won't be a public show brother branham says in that light that you see there in the picture he says that light that you see there in the picture left me and whirled on down into that little room right and brother brandon says i don't understand why that little wooden room and he says then the voice told me didn't jesus say when you pray be not like the hypocrite who prays openly but enter into your secret closet enter into your secret room and what you've done in secret your father will reward you openly and brother brendan says ah now i understand yes you're right and brother says his people begin to go into this little wooden room and he said they'd come out and he said and they'd look and he said they'd go in with missing limbs and he said they'd hit her in this little wooden room and he said and then they'd come out and their their arms were restored their missing limbs are restored he said someone would say what happened what happened to you in there i don't know i'm not sure what took place i don't know all i know is i was blind but now i see i'm missing limbs but i entered that little wooden room and now i'm whole again now listen to me friends what was he identifying the revival what was the tip a revival meeting what was happening listen to me i hope you don't miss it the focus was not what was taking place under the tent you see the focus in this day is not what's taking place in the message tent it's not what's taking place behind a man behind a pulpit but the focus is in a little room a little closet that you enter into and victory is one in that little room where is the revival gonna be friends is it gonna be a public show that you can look around in my everything looks so good no because it doesn't always look too good right but the revival will be sustained in your little wooden right right resistance can return tonight that little room and i want you to notice there was no preacher say brother man are you preaching we don't need a preacher no that's not what i'm preaching the bible says the bible says something like this if you didn't last and you couldn't survive with the footman how will you survive when the calvary comes listen to me friends we're living in the day of or hundreds of thousands of thousands of demons have been released against you you not a body not a group listen to me friends that's where we get things so mixed up god is not dealing with the bride as the bride yeah brother branham said after israel he never dealt with that group again the bride is not a bride because of a group that's gathered under a tent but it's the bride by a multi-membered individual body what is god dealing with not your church not your he's dealing with homes with families with individuals it doesn't mean that the entire church has to be spiritual you have to say like joshua as for me and my house we will serve the lord we refuse to compromise we refuse to get cold is that your desire tonight we refuse to get callous under the callous age that we live in we refuse to let our prayer life slip right that is my inheritance devon maybe a hittite squad on your prayer life but take that sword of the spirit and go get back what god gave to you right you won't survive keep this warning tonight without a prayer life you won't survive period right oh please hear my words hear the words on this side of grace on this side of mercy while there's still a chance without a personal intimate relationship with christ won't do it maybe it could ten years ago maybe you could last off the preaching that you get on wednesday on saturday sunday whenever you have church but we need everything that we can get in this age that we live in friends you won't make it your kids won't make it moms and dads if all you ever do is bring them to church tell them a message tell them all these kind of things and doctrines and theology unless there's a living church that goes with them on monday on tuesday or wednesday and a mom who prays and a dad who stays and a dad who's at home abiding as a high priest and confronting the demon spirits that are anointing and attacking his house then families won't survive right stand your feet with me tonight you can just play something for me softly sister i begin to think of this identifying the revival just play real softly for me if you can musicians i don't want you to think of this tonight here was a hat here was a room we know throughout the entire bible wood represents humanity throughout the whole bible wood represents humanity and brother branham says they entered this little secret room this little wooden room and they had missing limbs and he says but as they came on the other side those limbs were restored right and i began to think i don't have any missing limbs i had all my hands feet arms toes legs and you may say that tonight but then i begin to think the lord told me but you're part of a body the body of christ and in your body there's a missing dad a missing mom a missing son a missing daughter the devil would like us to go they're lost we'll bury them they're over we'll move on but don't accept that devil's lie i don't care how lost or how missing they see the church that prays the church that gets on their knees and enters that little wooden room brother madam said the missing limbs are restored you say i have missing loved ones i have this problem brother matt they've gone so far and mine just seems hopeless it's never hopeless with the god that i serve buy your heads with me tonight if you don't mind play that song do you know it there is a river that flows from deep within identifying the revival as we've said we could look at many things tonight on revival of a church of an age of the message but that really doesn't matter what matters is my revival just let god deal with your heart tonight friend where is your revival where is your home what things have you stopped doing that you used to do and things that you've started doing that you wouldn't do initially brother brennan says this in recognizing your dance message maybe you can pray this with him he begins to come to the end of his service and he says oh this is heavenly places in christ jesus i wouldn't swap this for anything you know how i love to fish and love to hunt because i see god in the wilderness i love it but i wouldn't change one minute for this for all the hunting experiences i can have one minute of this from that satisfaction god listen to this prayer create in me a revival all right let me be the revival god let each one of us be the revival the revival in me notice not the revival in the church or the revival of the message of the revival of the bride but just say god let it start right here not my brother not my sister let the revival start right here god make me lord he says to hunger make me to thirst created me lord that what is me which is needed in me let me be from this hour more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work we're looking to the things that are positive and forgetting those things which are in the past and are negative let me press towards the mark of the high calling that's our desire isn't it i'd like to just ask you tonight honest people nobody looking around but if you'd like to say and some hands are already up do you like that is saved by an uplifted hand create in me the revival moment if my revival has died if none go with me it's the whole world and the whole cosmos and the whole the entire everybody who claims the truth if they go south and if they go south on god oh lord let me look to the heavens let me look to the hills from what's come with my help let my fire burn let me be that one who you set to kill that overcometh will i grant to sit with me on my throne listen friend there's no promises here there's no givens you're not gonna make it just by coming to this
