with us so we say to you when you come one time now some have been here before back down so but still you know you come be with us one time you're a visitor two times you're part of us and we just welcome you and serve the lord amen now remember the announcements that are made we try to make sure that these are made while everybody's upstairs to where they will remember it and keep it in your mind and there will be a christmas dinner here next sunday and we will only be having one service next sunday so it'll be a christmas dinner together and then there will be no service here on the 25th

the watch night service then on the first day of january we will only have one service because of the late time going over the midnight before so we will have one service at one o'clock so remember that all right well you want to thank sister gail for the flowers that she put up here and we really appreciate that any other announcements i generally miss them but you know if you like turning your scriptures turned to matthew 25 and matthew 5 excuse me 5. and we will read where we've been reading from matthew 5 verse 37 through 48 and then we'll go from to matthew 5 verse 20. matthew 5 37 through 48 so you can read it off of the border but let's pray before we go into the service our heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your love thank you for everything thank you for the day and the hour that we're living thank you for you we just ask you to come now and speak to our hearts this morning as we try to speak to your people we ask you to just bless each and every one lord that we may all be together as one in you forgive our sins and lead us by thy grace keep us in the light of your love lord and this let us see the word that's being revealed for this day we as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we depend upon you guide us now keep us in jesus name amen matthew 5 37 i thought we'd be true with this the other day but i got a couple more messages so we just keep on reading this from matthew 5. verse 37 but let your communication be yeah for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a truth for a two but i say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man shall sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you now remember coming from the beatitudes blessed are you blessed are you blessed are you now he's sitting down a stage to show you what the life of christ is to be we are a blessed people right but now here is what we must live back it's going to take the new birth to do that part but he's describing that and bringing it down to the point see so verse 44 but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them to hate you and pray for them which to fightfully use you and curse persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send us rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so be there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now we're going to be from that part over to verse 20 of the fifth chapter for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven you may be seated lord that is listening to the reading of the word now we have been on this talking about perfection and what is perfection and how what it takes to make us perfect we've been on this now for uh this makes i think number 10 of the messages but we're trying to get a point to you to look at remember our life message we were talking about that the reason that our sins are covered is because that jesus christ died to take our place all right and then dying to take our place then he would impart his life into us and that would be the only way that a human mortal being that is born the way we are you know in sin and walking after the things of life that it would have would take the fact that he would have to come and live in us to give us eternal life and by giving us eternal life then it would be the fact the fact that he would be paying the price right we went through all of the old testament going through and covering how the atonement and what it was for to to offer an atonement and to you know to pay the price of of doing the things but that atonement of the old testament could not set the person free right it could only cover up that person to keep them from being destroyed but then when you come to the new testament jesus christ died once for all and see then he died for all of the sins of the old testament people and for the new testament and bringing it to work that we can see that jesus christ is the answer to all things all right so then we must have the new birth right right if we don't receive that new birthday then we're still just like everybody else we're still under the law he said now the law ended at calvary now the law ends when you're born again right right you're under the law until the time that you've become born again he said but jesus christ paid the price he did he paid the price that he ended the old testament the levitical priesthood the things like that but show me where it ended the fact that we were sinners no that's ended when you received the new you don't receive the new birth then you're still under the law you can say what you want to and think about it it is still there because that's what we're doing all right so we we've talked about our representation now that somebody had to represent us that bumper blood of the old testament just covered the people as i was saying but then when jesus christ came he offered his blood to become a covering for all of us to where it would cover our sins that god does not see us he sees the blood amen but he don't see the world either he sees the blood all right because if not he would have to destroy everything all right so he sees the the blood and that blood is our covering our representation but you know the blood now you're not saved by the blood no all right you're kept saved by the blood you saved by grace through faith by receiving jesus christ into your soul right by a new bird the blood is a covering all right so then you're not saved but you're kept saved by it in other words you're covered right like the old testament was covered the only difference is that this was the blood of gods and there would be more with the new testament because with the blood of god that could come back and cover us he would not only do that but the life that was in the blood would be able to come back upon us to give us eternal life all right so then that we've concluded one thing that's what i'm trying to bring it down to an end on these things and i may have one more message but so we have to to bring it to a point of saying that the only place you can be perfect is in your soul amen by the new birth because your body and your spirit is still in the world we're still subject to the world we're we're tempted and you know the problems of life and we're living right and we're human beings living upon earth and in that then we we realize that we are in a condition that's what paul said he said i'm in a body and they said i'm having troubles with this well that's the way we are we're human beings but we keep looking at the body to try to find perfection and you can't find perfection in the body right there's no way because what would you be looking for what would you find well the greatest person you could find you know you could say i heard our worst grandma she she was a good old lady and i agree she probably was and she really done you a lot of good and took care of you and raised you maybe and stuff like that and taught you a lot of good things but see she wasn't perfect in her body right you know her spirit and body her soul may have been perfect but the rest of her was just like all the rest of us right and got problems all right then in life there's nothing in you and i in this flesh that can be perfect right man but that inward part of us that's it by the new birth the soul can be made perfect because we have god's own life all right now that's what we've been trying to do is try to get us to see that by that new birth that's why you must have the new birth that's why we were listening last night the prophet said that the most important thing in life was that new birth because if we don't have the new birth we're lost it takes that to make it that way so then the only way that we can talk about being perfect is we must first start talking about how that perfection can be imparted unto us by jesus christ coming and living in us right now not a confession right amen we say well i i said that jesus is my savior well has he accepted you has he come to live in your heart if he hasn't come to live in your heart then the salvation has done you know good right man all right but the only those that are truly born again can say that they're perfect in their their soul they're being the world's not perfect there's no way to make it perfect right seeing god wants to come and live in you and give you his own life amen now we're going to pick up a little more on that this afternoon and a little thought to go with it but i want you to just listen and and pay attention this morning to what we're trying to talk about and we're going to use a lot of scripture now i didn't give these to them because it would take so much time trying to run them up and do it but i want you to to just look and see because the law could make nothing perfect it's always bringing out their wednesday if the law could make perfect then the levitical priesthood would have remained right that's right because that was where the law was given to the people right was under the levitical you know the the the priesthood back in the old testament all right so there was a necessity that there had to be another priesthood paul says all right and he'd have to be after the order of melchizedek which is the power of an endless life and not just a carnal person like right levitical priesthood like heroncy he had his problems but when he went behind that veil he had to be dressed right done right act right for that point to take care of him right and it was god making the atonement but see then jesus christ came with the tri not of the of the tribe of levi he came from the tribe of judah because it was promised judah not promising the levitical priesthood but promised judah that the lawgiver would come between his knees in other words would come from him from the tribe of judah and that was a promise in the bible so jesus had to come from the tribe of judah in what would be the natural thing of life now we know that he was almighty god then the lineage if you run your lineage you run a lineage by only following the male lineage all right so then it would come over to speak of joseph and joseph was not the father of jesus but that's just your law your your line of lineage isn't coming down if you're going to run anything we better run into mary but that would work either because she was not the the mother of god she was only an incubator that was hard of god because the virgin birth god created both egg and germ and which words sperms and things you want to use he created those and placed it in the wound of mary and she was not brother the mother of god jesus never called her mother he called a woman right amen all right but you see then he made a way to worry that he could could do that but the law could not do anything to you and i he would only condemn us all right if that's what we think about it today that the bible and the the prophet's message and the things we believe that it's still a bunch of rules then you're still under the law paul said to let her kill it no i'm a born again christian but i thank you no i think you are to be born again right if you're born again you'll live right right if you don't live right you're not born again is that sensible that doesn't need a big hammer of hitting you over the head to get you to see a light bulb does it that's just blind sense if i live like the devil then i am the devil the the one that's motivating me is the one that's that's taken care of all right but see in my body and my spirit i'm still part of the old curse of natural life i'm still under that curse of natural life i have to eat i have to drink i have to sleep right i have to work i have to do all these things why because i'm still under that part of life and see that but that part inside of me that soul which is perfect the law could never make the comer perfect it could only cover him right you can make an atonement for him all right now i hope that don't fall on your death ears to not remember all i've tried to preach about it because it says noah was perfect and job was perfect right because they made the atonement not because they could have eternal life because they could not have it under the old testament because jesus christ had not died all right that's right your new testament brings in the eternal life okay so now in doing that then we look at it see that my soul is the perfect part of me but my body and my spirit is still subject to the life but which one i yield to like the story was told you know about the the black dog white dog in the old end and said after me born again yeah white dog black dog all right he said which one wins chief he said the one i feed the most all right now if we feed this old body and spirit and live after the world then we've got a problem but if we let that inward man lead us then he can lead us to the lord all right but now by the law by the works and the things of keeping the law it could not make you perfect because there was nothing that could come within the individual it could make you perfect in the basis of covering you that god would be looking down and not seeing you and would call you a perfect man but it could not get inside of you to give you eternal life so then that would come up let's just start with a few scriptures let's go to galatians 2 and let's take a few scriptures and just go through this and and look at it and we're going to read a lot of scriptures with if we have the time to to look at galatians 2 and 16. knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ now you hear what he's saying right and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified so that the best we could do in life in the flesh life living the best we could do is not the perfection that is required of matthew 5 48 because it says therefore be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect all right then we read matthew 5 20 unless your righteousness so righteousness and perfection will have to go together unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees you won't enter but because that's that's the basis all right then that's the conditions it's placed upon to where we got to look at it so there's no way that you and i can have any concept i know wednesday night was probably the hardest message on me physically to try to preach because of trying my best to lay it down to get you to look at it because it's automatically within the human race that we think that god saved us because of something we've done or didn't know that's right and that's basically what's been taught to us down through life that's right and like i told you even in that message don't go tell your children don't teach your children of a mean old god that hates them for doing things tell them about the love of jesus christ to come and save them don't tell them god hates them because see they're going to remember that that's right that's right and what we've been taught in life is what motivates us we've been told all our life this is the right hand how do we know we've been told about horses horses are not measured by these are measured by hand whose hands according to some people's hand it'd be a shetland pony but according to brother hardline's hand if you remember him you'd have to get a ladder to get up onto the step to get onto the stirrup you know see we've been taught all of our life certain things amen and we've been we've been programmed and we've been been beat with a word to try to scare us into salvation right because we've been told you're gonna die go to hell for doing that right right and that dwells within us and then we come up and we say well brother dale i don't believe that no more i'm going to take a lie detector's test and see if it still ticks inside of us right because it does it's still there behind us is what i'm trying to get across wednesday we we still try to have some reason that we were saved something that we was good i remember reading about a gangster one time and you know he was a murderer he was all kind of things but he had one thing that he wouldn't do he wouldn't sell children's pornography never how you say those words because his wife didn't want it to be done well you know what he'd probably go up to judgment one day and he said well you know i didn't sell pornography it'd always be something that we want to try to deal with god about that i didn't do this or didn't do that right i've done this to the rich young ruler come on the rich young ruler said i've done these things for my youth i've kept the commandments right but jesus said you like one thing paul said concerning the law blameless he said the things i thought was life i found to be dead see paul was the legalist we call him today and that's what people think today and that's what i was trying to get across the prophet of god said when you women don't think cause you got long hair and long addresses and things right that's going to make you safe that's right and don't save you it's good and commendable it ought to be done right amen why because the word we follow in the word but it's not going to save us we're saved by grace through faith but it's said well again we wouldn't be saved by the blood we're kept saved by the blood that's right the life had to come out of that blood and it wasn't the life of of running through the veins of jesus that saves us you know that form of life it was the soul out of the individual right right you're alive that's why it's your whole witness we're talking about like that they won't take a blood transfusion because they believe the light is in the blood so if i give brother collie a transfusion then he's got some of my life that's what they believe right but see that's not true amen that's right see jesus christ could give you a blood transfusion but that wouldn't save you that's right because that's not the life that it comes it's the soul of the individual right that gave that gives us eternal life that's why in soul we're eternal perfect righteous but in our body and spirit we're still out here in the human realm well we're dealing with those things right all right he said well why do you have to preach to us about it well the reason is because we still let that reasoning factor controllers to the basis of saying well i i i i was i just didn't do this and that saved me no that's right you can't be good enough to be saved and don't worry about being lost you're born that way right don't worry about how what you've done caused you to be lost now what we've done in our lives didn't cause it to be lost right we lost because of our representation back in the beginning that put us in the world of sin see that's what i was trying to bring wednesday night and it was just it's hard on me because it was a it was a burden to try to express it because you said well brother dale none of us here believes that man well maybe it's me then you know maybe i'll talk about myself right because you see we always want some way well i didn't do that i i'm not like other people i i never did drunk well glory that makes a good alcoholics anonymous person but then you say let us sin that grace be about paul said god forbid come on that's why it's so hard because you try to preach the truth and people's mind will lead you to the wrong way could i don't say well let's go out and sin that god may save us right paul said god forbid amen to get that garbage can out of your mind i believe in being born again amen right amen that's right and then the life will follow the morning to get experience if not then you're not born again so i get on that i'm sitting back on wednesday nights but all right by putting his own life within me that's what it couldn't be done under that old testament there was no way for that life to be able to come back into that believer right but in the new testament the life coming into the believer by the new birth in my soul and it makes me then come on just as righteous as he is amen and just as perfect as he looks why because paul said it's not i that liveth right right but christ that liveth in me amen so i'm not talking about my perfection right you know the scripture over our righteousness is what filthy rags the best we can do isaiah i believe it is called it filthy rags you say well don't you think we're to live good if you're a christian you will live good if not what does it matter what you do that's why it's so hard for people to understand brother ryan when he would would preach and say that sin is not drinking gambling smoking running around with women that's not sin right all right that's right lady finally said one day well tell me what is sin he says unbelief he said you do those things because you're an unbeliever those are attributes of sin right sin is unbelief and we're listening last night we're brought around and brought it down to where the lady just doubted this doubted something that was said he said see that is sin that's an unbelief he said like i've always told you we've been in there in in the scripture where we was reading in exodus they sent 10 times from the time they left egypt to get into cadiz barnett right and god was still going to take them to the lane that's right but when they come back with a false report and wouldn't believe that god was able to take them in and capture the land then they went back to the wilderness for 40 years that was their unbelief god can put up with a lot of things but when it comes to unbelief don't lie and make fun of nobody that's not right all right now now the one try one thing that i've tried to make in this service this series of series that you and i must say what god says amen that's not what i say it's not what you say right in my eyes you will never be perfect but in your eyes i never will be perfect right so that solves the problem there's no such thing as a perfect human being in flesh and and things because of life that we live in because the bible says anything in our faith is sin well you eat too much blood pressure goes up problems do we kill ourselves but get the point now i've tried to make it over and over and over and over to you we've got to say what god says right amen all right so he says now matthew 5 48 for be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect that's a requirement right that's it okay right then we read in matthew 5 20 that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and mercies you'll not enter heaven two things facing us two condemnations right right now the scribes and pharisees especially the pharisees i told you why i believe that scribes is placed in there because that would just cover everybody then you know life because it would generally say pharisees and sadducees you know we see the to the pharisee paul said i'm blameless according to the law he said i'm a pharisee of the pharisees and hebrew the hebrew blameless according to the law okay now did that save him he said that's what it's killing him right exactly amen now look at it you say that was a man that according to the law was blindless you know what the high priest if he wasn't blameless he got killed that's right that's right you had to go behind the veil right right is he went in there anything he had to have the bible just the blood for his own sins and the sins for others it wasn't just for the sins of others it's for his own sins he had to enter their him right and offer that atonement everything had to be right but what about trying to compare with a man that according to the law is perfect according to the law paul was righteous because righteousness and righteous and all it just deals from the word right and the word right is where you start from and the word writing just simply means you're not guilty right right you're not guilty that's the best definition of right and to be righteous means that in your life you have not been guilty that we come out to righteous because you're not guilty all right then in righteousness it would come out to the point of talking about a human being living in life as a perfection let's pull that up brother jones so we can read it the definition on the word righteous just the state of him who is as he ought to be i like that righteous the condition acceptable to god that's a doctrine concerning the way in which man may attain and stay approved of god it means integrity virtue purity of life righteousness correctness of correctness of thinking feeling and acting and in our sense just are the virtue which gives each his due all right now righteousness just the state of fact of not being guilty coming from the word right now perfect would be the same definition right i may use a word different all but it's basically the same definition it just simply means that you've never done it right now under the old testament atonement when that atonement was made god looked down and said noah is perfect right you can say he was righteous right why because he wasn't guilty right justification is one we don't have time to cover the three stages wade was doing a good job the other night on it but justification means you chopped off your five sins all right then you'll never have to answer for that you get condemned in your heart and you pray out god forgive me of my sins and you know what you may die and go to hell for what you do after them all right but you're not gonna die and go to hell for what you've done let me forgive you right yes sir so the word just the word right the word perfect it's all coming to the same meaning you're not guilty right amen so if the blood was the atonement even brother brown said i cannot bring up things people has done in their lives if they've repented right sure amen he said we're calling this gun now you know what i can though didn't you i don't i look at you and i can you see when we're looking at it from god's eyes you see how everything's different all right now there's a lot said in the bible about righteousness and i don't have time to cover all of it but we'll just run through a few scriptures and and do but let's start with them with a statement brother brown made from the church age book revelation of jesus christ number one now i want you to read this i want you to think about what he's saying think about what he's saying now no man knows the things of god save the spirit of god and he to whom the spirit of god reveals them we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world and watch we have accepted the bible that's right see we swear by it yes sir this is god's word blood's worth right here he said holy bible in front of it we believe it yep but has it been revealed that's right so what do you say we have accepted the truth of it but it's still not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not dire that's right so now we need the revelation about the spirit more than anything else right do you ever pray for a revelation amen you ever pray for god to reveal something to you you know i'm just honest and that you know how i study so you listen to what i'm saying if you stop studying so much and start asking god to help you right right because you ain't gonna study yourself into it that's correct now understand that one i didn't say not to study the bible says study to show yourself approved i said what we do a lot of time you know what we do a lot of times you won't run around i give you this quote you know that we spend a lot of time crying out before god when we ought to pray for a while and sit down and listen and see whether he wants to speak to us or not you want that quote right he said we want to sit down sometimes and listen said we do all the talking that's right come on you know that old pharisee standing there lord i thank you i'm not like this guy over here i fast i do everything i kept the law to the letter man over on the other side and just barely about his head and said god forgive me i'm a sinner the bible said which my own justified that's right which did god count to be righteous all right so we need a revelation more than anything see the revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickly now look at the scriptures he goes right to to tell us has not been quitted look the bible says in ii corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of god himself by being in christ it says that he jesus became sin for us does not say became sinful but became sin for us that we by our union with him we might become to come the righteousness of god now watch it if we accept the fact what if we accept the fact that he died for us now is anybody in here going to reject that he died for you if you do you got a problem with your peanut brain right let alone needing salvation but look if we accept the fact that he became sin for us our substitution all right we've got to accept what he says about us to accept the one is to accept the other now we know the bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it's not real to the majority of god's children it is just a good verse in the bible but we need to have it made alive that will take revelation now there was a scripture in the things that i was sitting in the deer stand listening to brother branham on my ipod and that's what struck me and i preached this about perfection i mean knowing this would eventually come yeah preach perfection nine sermons to talk about it if we accept the fact that jesus christ died for us right right now do we accept that fact amen that's right dude we don't ain't no problem right right but it was except the fact that he died for us amen then we must accept the fact that he by coming into us by a union you know by the new birth he's made us just as righteous as he is all amen well then why do we say we're not right well there's no good i'm not perfect you're not perfect ain't nobody perfect the bible says you are the bible said noah was and he died of drunk that's right come on when are we gonna say what god says right does it matter how sick you are that's what everybody thinks well oh yeah i agree with it if i'm healed no you'll never be healed that way right you've got to say you're healed believe you're healed ask god for a revelation that you're healed and even after he reveals it to you he didn't say when he'd take it away that's right the prophet of god said that healing is not eternal he said thereby you can lose it yep even though he has spoken unto you and revealed it unto you and wait a second brother if he's revealed to him he'll come no wait a minute your prophet said the same unbelief same faith you took it away same unbelief will bring it back that's right all right man you doubt what god says you can lose your healing that's right that's right i don't agree with you dying people say that's okay you go ahead and do what you want to that's what i'm telling you i believe right because that's how strong i believe it and you can't lose your salvation because it's eternal amen that's right but if your justification and sanctification coming unto salvation you can lose every bit of it right and dying go to hell absolutely amen miss the whole time right all right we see healing is on the basis of the fact that your confession keeps making it right now to think about that then we need to be saying what god says right amen amen he says we're perfect right he says we're righteous at least we could say what he all says but then we turn on so i just don't see nobody else well michael feller said you know when everybody left his church with nothing but him and his wife and he's looking over at her one day you know and he said i'm beginning to wonder about thou now so if god's word is true where's the problem with us saying right right but you know i've talked with people even here that i know your thoughts i don't want to confess that i'm healed because i might not be and i'd be a liar no you just born money anyway don't worry about it you born one just forget it don't ever try to figure out where you're a liar or not you're born one right i ain't never lied in my life jack cole said you're the biggest liar here that lady said you know my tongue i want to lay it on the altar he said lady it's alright but 14 foot and ain't enough room for your tongue you think brother that was hard but how can we ever talk think about right as a human mortal of being righteous that's correct see we've got to depend upon what he's done our dependence cannot be upon anything of our lives well i didn't do this or i didn't do that see you've been taught that all your life that's why you're you're still thinking right you've been taught that you didn't do this and that makes you good makes you good neighbor that's that we're gonna make you a christian that's right amen if you check in your bible i don't say it now ago you say let's end it god and that we might be saying god forbid paul said but if you'll check your record you'll find out the biggest portion of those at our site are those that have went out in the world and done a lot wrong because it's hard to get a lot of old good old self-righteous hypocrites saved right paul would say i didn't do them things but he said that's my enemy that's killing me i can say i didn't drink i didn't do this i didn't do that that's my enemy right you think it ain't what it is when we come in this message there was a lot of legalists still are a lot but a lot of them taught if you didn't drink you didn't smoke you didn't chew you didn't run around women then you was capable of being saved i said well i didn't do that anyway a lot of it i did now but i said that make me save you see i was told i saved when i knew i would when you're in the message yours yes you're in the message you believe it don't you everything wrote around says that don't mean you're saved that's right that's right devil believes everything he says right inside me knows a whole lot more about him we do he had the computer before we did let's just go back why he was dealing with abraham let's go back there and just read that where he was at in genesis 15. and enjoy this services he he done while he was gone hope you did maybe he'll get around to finishing it up matter of fact he do it wednesday genesis 15 and 6 is what right and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness now we get on this evening about the imputing of sin but we don't deal very much about counting or imputing righteousness we want to impute sin we don't like to talk about imputing righteousness right or counting because that's the same word impute reckon count is the same word right so what was it that would be about abraham that would make god count it as righteousness he believed it that's right now i've always told you and i believed it see a lot of people think well abraham's the only one god come down and deal with no the prophet of god said every person in the world paraphrasing shorten the story of every person in the world has got that same ability he said no that ain't according to so-and-so because he taught you see i don't care what he told me i'm telling you what the bible says what the prophet said you can deal whatever joe said yourself we think that abraham was a certain kind of a good guy and that's what made god deal with him why can't you see that god would deal with all mankind it makes it greater for me to understand it this way that god would deal with everybody you know in some way or the other right amen right but abraham believed it well you know everybody wants to make it some country abram believed that's the greatest of all i could ever think about that's right you know what everybody else didn't believe me like i've always told you jesus was seen of over 500 brethren after his resurrection come on read your bible but only 120 of them believed him that's right because the others wasn't in the upper room 20120 believed him 380 didn't believe it oh they believe what he said yeah they seen him the hell he made handling me oh yeah but they didn't make it leopard right what is so great about abraham you know that some people can't believe that's right sure i've told you over and over there's no guy used to work here at the plant my name was dozer and he told brother mo one day he said why they didn't go out up to the moon that's when i turned the desert well if he's able to fly up and go out in the desert why couldn't he do a little more horsepower flying out but you know but that's why he couldn't believe it abraham believed god amen what did he have any different come on read your bible he leaves air he goes he does all because of what some thought came in his mind did you hear it did he hear an audible voice i don't know you know did god come down with an audible voice and talk to him i don't know and you don't either so no problem with it because it doesn't record it just said the lord spoke to abram right he believed he kept on telling anything he kept believing it that's right people told me says brother there you just believe too much of what people say well until you've just proved you're a liar i'm gonna believe what you're saying but then when it's proven you're a liar and you're the liar not me some people just can't believe that's right man a lot of voices don't you think that satan could have talked to abram too sure you know what i love about it and we talked about telling my wife the other day when wade was preaching on something that kept on trying and we illustrated his abram abram may remain but you get over new testament they never use the word abram they were used in the new testament right once he got his name changed and never used no more right not in the bible no more that is abram used abraham but never was using the new testament because that's where god looks at mine so he believed in god you believe what god said he goes through all of it you can take it to each one of the stages that he goes through you know he believed him well if i just hear the voice of god i believe it that's what i said how many people did he talk to in that day right amen how many people today is god talking to it right judas believed right right then he quit believing yes right that's it the bible says there in a lot of it decisions and the people believed all right i believed it those that had the belly full of fish and loads they believed he could multiply food well maybe the next chapter is ready to kill him right right because it didn't bring me some more food and fish you know right yeah but you understand what i'm saying when i was in the baptist i used to argue with the baptist because the badgers say well you you if you believe you're saved i said that ain't bible and i told them that when i was there i didn't get along with them it's good no more than i do here i said that's not the bible the bible said he that believeth you know what abraham done he just kept on believing believe it every time god would talk to him it got greater he got more sure until he finally even met god but he was a believer or he wouldn't have never met him there you know right so what is the secret of becoming righteous right are you listening what is the secret of being perfect to believe what god says right yeah we're going to get on something this afternoon because you know i'm going to just preach my heart out on one thing where it said about david blesses a man to whom god will not impute sin i want you to think about that until this afternoon and i want you to tell me who that man is right and i'm not talking about jesus the man i'm talking about i want to know who that man is right that god will not impute sin when we covered it last night in the bible study then we're going to give an account of the deeds done in the body brother brown had to preach marriage and divorce correct all right who is it just write it down give it to me is this great seed doctrine is it this great this or is it because you this from you so good right now who is that man that god won't impute sin all right so it's based on whether or not you can believe all right let's go to romans i told you a lot of scripture we may continue this service this afternoon but i don't doubt if i'm going to get through with it let's go to romans 4. and let's talk about this man named abraham and let's get in new testament terminology taken from the old testament terminology that he believed god god could not come down into his heart back there and give him eternal life right well let's ask a man named paul oh what do you think about abraham and how was this man brought to a state of righteousness okay romans 4 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh had found now what's he found pertaining to the flesh if abraham were justified by works he hath were of the glory but not before god so it can't be based on works okay for what saith the scripture now if abraham were justified by works what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness nothing about his works and you go over to james and james says show me your faith without your words right but that can't be contrary one to the other right right works is faith expressed okay watch verse 4. now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt right in other words you go to work you expect to get paid right right if you don't go to work you don't expect to get paid right of course that's changed in this day whenever i get paid for not going to work but and they want to talk about here i'm talking about the fact that even if abraham had some kind of works it would have been debt that god hold him we gave you the quotes from wrote around work that if you think you've done anything to save you christ died in vain amen he never died for you there's anything you think you've done or didn't do he didn't die for you right so listen under him that worketh is a reward not reckon of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justified the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness okay and i thought we get to it this afternoon probably but i thought we were born from faith to faith all right but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justified the unknown what did that graham do he believed god his faith his revelation is counted for righteousness and there's the only channel for righteousness right okay even i told you i'm gonna get into this now so even as david also described the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works right now that's not over in the psalms see this is paul describing david's explanation in the spirit that's that's why i like to read the bible but i like to read it and think about it see even as david describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works right well god loved david so much yep he was fixing to kill me right and he would have it hadn't been for nathan the prophet but what is david saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin who is that man now you're going to describe that it can't be something uh some human reasoning you know that would make a man righteous we just got to find out it's not works it's faith right right now he's going to describe that it can't be anything you think because you had this seed in you because you were born a child of god because you have done this because you've done that so let's let him describe it cometh this blessing upon the uh the circumcision only know the jews are upon the uncircumcision also now does the blessing come on the circumcision only or does it come on the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness now what how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision in other words when god met abraham first he didn't circumcise you read your bible come on he didn't circumcise him upon their first meeting reach him out he was on over in the story that he required circumcision it was not when they first started because abraham was a gentile no no he wasn't you give me the bible there was no such word jew until the kings that's way on over in the scriptures and it was really the tribe of judah when other tribe was called jews but paul said i'm not all israel is israel not all jews are jews abraham was a gentile you want the quotes from the prophet so he believed god when he was in uncircumcision sure amen he was a healer worshiping idol helping his daddy make a living make an island or daddy that's right oh no abraham was a special genetic seed well if that was true now let's take that out of the way come at this blessing verse 9 upon thee see jew only or upon thee oh hedonistic gentiles no promise no word but we say that faith was reckoned abraham for righteousness how was it then recognized when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that's right he believed when he was uncircumcised are you following it that's right are you reading he believed when he was uncircumcised and god counted it for righteousness then had him to have circumcision that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be circum may be not circumcised that righteousness not might be imputed unto them also and the father circumcision of them who are not of the circumcision only and who is the father the gentiles the jews everybody but who walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised so it don't count him as being some kind of special something right and only counts him to be able to believe god believing god was what made it counted for his righteousness amen that's right believing god is what made noah perfect right right believing god is what made job perfect right because he believed god and he offered the atonement that god said to do he said you go on for this and i'll make you perfect he told abraham walk before me and be thou perfect it's over time righteousness and perfection and all together as not as something that you and i could do but counting it what you can believe you know this would be true what i'm fixing to say if you told the world especially the religious world that if they'd stand on their head they'd all be saved do you know what would happen that most everybody would be trying to balance some juggle act to get on their head or you tell them to give this we had a guy right across the street from us live in the baptist church they preached him into heaven when he died because he painted the church and never do all the things he was a homosexual they sure didn't tell him he couldn't thank the church you say you're gonna tell somebody they can't wash down their church calling it homosexual but i'm gonna tell you ain't going to happen so let's go ahead and wash it down what do you understand it's what you believe but that's not what you believe or just what you believe it's what you believe about what god says right that's it abraham believed god spoke to him he must have he got up his family took off left them rich their own you know a lot nice life and everything heads out into the desert just because god said get up and believe here he didn't appear to him and meet him as melchizedek and all this and the other to begin with he traveled a large journey across him before he ever meets him as those forms we believe god amen the prophet of god said it's hard to get one man to believe another one but what if that man tells you what god says what does it matter who the man is right exactly right the donkey told the prophet one time uh you know you'd be killed if i hadn't he's talking to him i was thinking about that like not people thinking well you know animals don't talk they think we'll learn the garden you know you talk about the beast and you know the beast and eve talking they say animals don't talk well don't what do you believe god do you really believe what god says about you we'll have to end right there will come we'll have to see them more about this this afternoon we'll try to continue but think on these signs is it the goodness you've done or not done or whatever is that you believe in god because if it's the goodness you've done or didn't do then that's works and works would be dead then god would owe it to you that's right right that's sensible right man if there's anything we can do or not do then god owes it to us right just keep on believing what god said right he says you're righteous well i don't know what's eating your confessions not the same with you i thought we were supposed to i thought he was the high priest of our profession our confession right so whatever we confess is what he can confess back right right now i'm going to make this plane for just a second from the musician if you get ready don't get up because i want you to listen then if there's anything that we could think of in any way then christ didn't die for you absolutely because you're not believed amen if you think that you're a certain seed a certain line or a certain person then that would be dead and not grace if you think there's something i've done or didn't do or whatever they thing god owes it to you but if you can believe that no matter how good you say brother dale you don't believe in being good i've told you over and over and people don't understand that but that's all right i'm sorry i don't want you to be good i want you to be saved because if you get saved you'll be great the goodness will follow the saved life that's right amen that's right well don't you think sure i got a neighbor down there and said find a neighbor that would do anything in the world for me that's right he says you know where the tractor's at and the keys in it don't ask me for use of it he'd do anything in the world for me i believe is that going to save him maybe being good to me might save him as a foolish virgin we're talking about eternal life right here but you see if we can in any way conjure anything up right where would it be believing god would it be believing god well that's just too simple brother david to believe god i thought he was hidden and revealed in simplicity that's right i thought it was supposed to be simple i thought it was like what it joined the two and nine salvations of the lord right it's the goodness of god that leadeth me to repentance why did jesus give the parable of the the weight going in you know and the rich man couldn't go in because he had too many carers he didn't say nobody rich couldn't be saved he just said the biggest portion won't be because they won't give up what they're doing the rich young ruler proved it jesus didn't ask him for everything he had that's right and he said yes he did say what you have to give to the poor if he sold it kept height of it jesus said amen but what do you think about it you believe god you believe god's speaking to you maybe threw it down donkey no problem you see the only way you can be righteous is to believe god the only way you can be perfect is to believe god right right come on jesus faith is a revelation why would it have to be revealed to you if you was a certain scene yeah that's right you're a person or something that was you know good about it right but you don't believe the prophet talked about a seed yes sir a sure flat do i believe that prophet was a seed don't you but you know he said he had to go out there and get born again because listen to him last night said he'd come up there and save me he said i used to box that i used to have a temper he said i've tried everything it didn't work but he said when the holy ghost came they took care of everything that's right brother brown do you mean you had to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and he said and you that believe mary was the mother of god he said then your one you're talking about had to go to the upper room to receive eternal life so were there any good things that we could do that's right all by grace amen and then our works displays it what do we got 154 inspired let's stand together anybody have a need when you've got just a few minutes you have a need come and let's believe from if not why uh can we believe it here we place the blood of our lord and savior that we talk about between you satan and our sister tell me ladies anybody can you believe god she got ready she would like to make fun of our sister and cousin or whatever she said he'll be back i got five more minutes she believed it right on time father we thank you for this day we ask you man just go with us as we go separate for a little while to eat natural meals and thank glory we pray that you would just bless each one father help us to believe you to believe what you see it and then no matter what anybody else says we stand on that and believe it we love you father and we thank you forgive our sins and lead us have your way in jesus name you're dismissed thank you uh my is uh uh
