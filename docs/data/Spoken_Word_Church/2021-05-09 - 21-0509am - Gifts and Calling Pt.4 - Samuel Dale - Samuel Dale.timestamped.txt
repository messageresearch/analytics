[3:13] opening the reading of your word
[3:14] we ask in your name jesus christ amen
[3:19] as we read
[3:22] it's kind of a odd scripture to me it's
[3:24] not really odd but it's god's word but
[3:27] to um we always want to read about the
[3:28] good things all about the grace and the
[3:30] mercy and all the patent on the head and
[3:32] stuff but
[3:33] listen his word is solid
[3:36] it's all we have it's the truth and for
[3:39] everything that goes out
[3:40] there's got to be something that comes
[3:42] back and for that that don't come back
[3:45] wasn't meant to be to start up with so
[3:46] there's judgment in this word
[3:49] we don't want to be here for the
[3:50] judgment folks so as we read
[3:55] 28 8 for all the tables are full of
[3:57] vomit
[3:58] and filthiness so that there is no place
[4:09] claimed
[4:12] amen for precept must be upon precept
[4:15] precept upon precept line upon line
[4:19] line upon line here little and they're
[4:26] little
[4:28] to whom he said this is rest wherewith
[4:32] ye may cause the weary to rest and this
[4:35] is the
[4:36] refreshing yet they would not hear
[4:53] my god
[4:59] wherefore hear the word of the lord ye
[5:02] scornful men
[5:03] that rule this people which is in
[5:09] have made a jerusalem with death and
[5:11] with hell
[5:12] are we at agreement when the oath
[5:15] flowing scourge shall pass through
[5:18] it shall not come unto us for we have
[5:21] lost
[5:22] our refuge
[5:26] therefore thus saith the lord behold i
[5:30] lay in zion
[5:30] for a foundation a stone a tried stone a
[5:33] precious cornerstone
[5:35] a sure foundation he that believeth
[5:38] shall not make haste
[5:50] righteousness
[5:52] the hiding place and your covenant with
[5:55] death
[5:55] shall be disenold and your agreement
[5:57] with hell shall not stand
[5:59] when the overflowing scourge shall pass
[6:01] through then ye shall be trodden
[6:04] down by it from the time
[6:20] for the bed is shorter than a man can
[6:22] stretch himself on it
[6:24] and the covering narrow that he may
[6:27] that he can wrap himself in it for the
[6:30] word
[6:30] of the lord
[6:34] he shall be worth in the valley of
[6:36] gibeon
[6:37] that he may do his work his strange work
[6:41] and bring to pass his act his strange
[6:44] act
[6:45] thank you for the opening of the word
[6:47] reading of the word you may be seated

[17:30] and doing okay now
[17:33] we've we've picked up this point or
[17:35] thought and been considering it for us
[17:38] and it says verse 29 of the 11th chapter
[17:42] for the gifts the many gifts now
[17:47] okay and calling of god
[17:51] are without repentance all right
[17:55] now the gifts and one calling but many
[17:58] gifts
[18:00] in the body of christ there's many gifts
[18:03] but there's just one calling make your
[18:05] calling and election sure
[18:08] you know what you're doing also we're
[18:10] working on getting
[18:12] the things fixed up we're gonna have
[18:14] some two boards back here where you can
[18:16] be able to
[18:17] uh see the scriptures and things as they
[18:20] shoot up instead of just having this one
[18:22] screen
[18:22] because it blocks off with some people
[18:25] and and and things like that
[18:27] where you having to sit but we're going
[18:29] to try to get that done but they're
[18:30] they're working on getting it in order
[18:32] okay now let's go to the
[18:37] ephesians 4.
[18:41] we'll start with verse 7. but unto every
[18:44] one of us is given grace
[18:46] according to the measure of the gift of
[18:49] christ
[18:51] wherefore he says when he ascended up on
[18:54] high he led captivity captive
[18:57] and gave gifts unto men now god
[19:01] led captivity captive that's right
[19:04] but he also gave gifts to man
[19:09] all right now now watch those gifts
[19:12] okay now he ascended
[19:16] now that he ascended what is it that he
[19:19] also descended first into the lower
[19:21] parts of the earth
[19:23] he that descended is the same also that
[19:26] ascended up far above all heavens
[19:28] that he might fill all things and he
[19:31] gave now what are the gifts that he gave
[19:35] we'll get into it we've been running
[19:36] through it there's nine spiritual gifts
[19:39] in first corinthians 12 that lists the
[19:42] nine spiritual gifts
[19:44] that's in the church but then he hears
[19:46] something special
[19:48] and he gave some what
[19:52] gifts now gifts
[19:55] that's what he's talking about right
[19:56] because that's what he said he led
[19:58] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[19:59] men
[20:00] what to give and he gave some apostles
[20:03] some prophets and some evangelists and
[20:06] some pastors
[20:07] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[20:09] saints for the work of the ministry
[20:12] or the edifying of the body of christ
[20:15] for how long till we all come in the
[20:18] unity of the faith
[20:20] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[20:21] and to a perfect man and to the measure
[20:23] of the stature
[20:25] of the fullness of christ why what's all
[20:27] this to do
[20:29] that we henceforth be no more children
[20:32] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[20:34] every wind of doctrine
[20:36] by the slight of men and cunning
[20:38] craftiness whereby they lie in white to
[20:40] deceive
[20:41] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[20:43] up into him
[20:44] in all things which is the head even
[20:48] christ you may be seated the lord that
[20:50] is blessing to the
[20:52] reading of the word
[20:58] terence said it was a visitor so if it's
[21:01] somebody
[21:02] you come here one time you're a visitor
[21:04] you counted a visitor but
[21:06] you come back you're not counting the
[21:07] visitor you're just part of us
[21:09] you know that that all works in that
[21:11] order okay now we've been
[21:14] for quite a while trying to cover and i
[21:16] want to read some things and then
[21:18] like i said we'll try next sunday if
[21:21] lord willing if you'll do it if you'll
[21:24] just write out your questions
[21:26] and you say well
[21:29] i i can't right question well just write
[21:31] down what in the world are you talking
[21:32] about
[21:34] well there's no problem what are you
[21:36] talking about what are you doing what
[21:38] are you saying
[21:39] you know there's no problems with it
[21:41] we'll we'll try our best to be able to
[21:44] uh cover these things and doing this is
[21:47] message number three
[21:49] picked off of what we've been talking
[21:50] about on predestination
[21:52] we may go back and hang another message
[21:54] or so in there later
[21:56] because i believe in predestination
[22:00] i believe you're predestinated by
[22:02] foreknowledge
[22:05] god is not you know picking and choosing
[22:08] he predestinates by his foreknowledge
[22:12] but remember now there are some things
[22:14] that goes in there that we must
[22:15] understand because
[22:17] all of this is transpiring in the mind
[22:19] of god before the world ever begun
[22:23] all right so then we get our
[22:24] predestination back in line
[22:27] but what i want you to think on today
[22:30] is the one thing we've been driving hard
[22:32] and i don't want you to miss this
[22:34] because we're going to be talking about
[22:36] the the
[22:37] church and its operational parks and and
[22:40] seeing it
[22:42] and then getting into the what he said
[22:45] he gave some apostles some prophets some
[22:47] pastor some
[22:48] teacher or he gives you what you have
[22:52] need of
[22:55] all right now is that understandable
[22:58] he gives you what you have need of
[23:02] all right some people they had there to
[23:04] have a they
[23:06] you know i'm going to say this and and
[23:07] lay it out in the right order now
[23:09] but then i'm going to come back just to
[23:11] because see
[23:12] every church every church
[23:16] has to have a pastor
[23:21] all right every church you know
[23:25] has to have a pastor every individual
[23:31] must have a pastor
[23:36] i've had ministers to even make remarks
[23:39] you know
[23:40] of i ain't going to pay tithes to no
[23:42] minister well
[23:44] all right go ahead you're not in the
[23:46] body of christ
[23:49] now we're talking about the body of
[23:51] christ
[23:52] we're talking about what the word says
[23:55] so it's not what i've got to say
[23:58] it's what god says in his word all right
[24:02] see everybody must have a pastor you
[24:04] know what he brought around him even
[24:05] said
[24:06] who was it the woman there in the bible
[24:08] said uh
[24:10] elijah was her pastor whether she
[24:11] believed it or not
[24:13] all right well see she didn't want no
[24:16] pastor well that's the way a lot of
[24:17] people
[24:18] are but now you tell me how you're going
[24:22] to
[24:22] to be able to uh follow the word of god
[24:26] well i i don't like nobody that i don't
[24:28] i can't find nobody
[24:29] well i agree with you to a degree yeah
[24:33] i agree with you to a certain degree
[24:35] there's a lot of these churches i
[24:37] wouldn't go to
[24:39] there's a lot of them i would not sit
[24:41] down in that call that my pastor
[24:45] because they're off the word.
[24:48] but that's worthy he said he gave some
[24:52] yes he gives us what we have need of
[24:56] now the prophet said it's god would take
[24:59] if somebody's got a question
[25:02] you got a question about he said god is
[25:04] obligated
[25:06] to put somebody on the pulpit to answer
[25:08] that question
[25:10] all right and there's your five full
[25:12] ministry
[25:15] okay and see we're going to get to that
[25:17] in a minute
[25:18] and and lay things out but i want you to
[25:20] understand what i'm saying me
[25:22] that i'm saying whether you believe it
[25:24] or not that's your business
[25:27] but see everybody has to have a pastor
[25:29] because how would you work without one
[25:31] that's right
[25:34] well i don't know then go find go hunt
[25:37] till you find one god's got one out
[25:39] there somewhere for you
[25:41] if you want it now we're not talking
[25:43] about flim flames
[25:45] we're not talking about just any kind of
[25:47] garbage cans
[25:49] we're talking about a true fivefold
[25:51] ministry
[25:54] that god gave now let me ask you this
[25:58] because i've got the quote that runs
[26:00] right straight to it
[26:01] do you believe the baptism of the holy
[26:03] ghost is the gift of god of eternal life
[26:08] that's what the bible says now it's the
[26:11] gift of eternal life
[26:13] what is the gift of eternal life through
[26:15] jesus christ
[26:16] all right so then we're not talking
[26:19] about just this that or the other
[26:20] it's not your idea it's not my idea it's
[26:24] not doing and it won't give me no more
[26:26] money for me to stray it hard and
[26:27] straight than it will if i say it weak
[26:29] enough
[26:29] so i'm going to say the way i have to
[26:31] say it because that's the way i've
[26:33] always had to be
[26:35] far as anything else we ain't worried
[26:37] about it
[26:38] but see i'm telling you this church must
[26:41] have a pastor
[26:43] if you don't believe this if you do not
[26:46] believe that i
[26:46] am the pastor of the church well then go
[26:49] somewhere
[26:50] else that's not a problem
[26:54] that's just a flat blunt statement a
[26:56] point it ought to be
[26:57] find your place because he gave some
[27:01] apostles
[27:03] he gave you what you have need of it's
[27:06] out there somewhere
[27:10] for you but see you must have a pastor
[27:15] all right you say well well brother dale
[27:18] what
[27:18] how do i how does pastor pay tithe i've
[27:21] been through all of these things up and
[27:22] down over all the years so i don't worry
[27:24] about it
[27:25] i pay tithe
[27:29] i have to pay tithe because that's part
[27:32] of my duty
[27:35] well who do you pay tithe to i've had
[27:36] preachers to say that
[27:38] you pay it to yourself now boy that'd be
[27:41] the right hand in putting the money in
[27:43] the left pocket and moving it over and
[27:44] getting it back and
[27:46] well that'd be something wouldn't it
[27:50] these minister brothers that minister
[27:52] here they get paid to minister
[27:56] that way i can pay my tithe
[27:59] we have something comes up overseas or
[28:01] something
[28:02] that is a needful thing
[28:05] i can take then from my part that i
[28:09] have have put aside and i can send that
[28:13] and we send a lot of money out and you
[28:15] say well is that tithe well why not
[28:18] because it's something we set aside in
[28:20] the bible they had a
[28:22] a um the high priest
[28:25] was in charge of everything right you
[28:28] got to admit that or you're going to
[28:29] argue yourself to death about it you
[28:31] know
[28:31] the hype the high priest he's in charge
[28:34] all right so then he would divvy out of
[28:37] what it was needed he would take care of
[28:39] everything
[28:40] now somebody else is helping him he's
[28:41] not the only one got the money in the
[28:43] bundle and going
[28:44] no no there's offices set up and things
[28:47] like that
[28:48] but yet he's in charge
[28:52] okay see then when you come over into
[28:54] the new testament see
[28:56] then you see that the pastor is in
[28:58] charge
[29:02] he's in charge because he's the one to
[29:05] be
[29:06] doing it you say well well brother dale
[29:08] uh i i don't have a pastor i've got a
[29:10] prophet
[29:14] how are you going to do that
[29:20] now what a man is and what he's doing is
[29:22] a different thing what gifts are is
[29:24] gifts and all like that
[29:25] sure we haven't but what are you going
[29:28] to do see if you don't pay tithe you're
[29:30] not a born-again believer
[29:33] that's what i said i'll just make it
[29:34] straight and blunt
[29:36] and then at least you won't
[29:37] misunderstand me
[29:39] you know because i'm putting at that
[29:42] blunt to where
[29:42] see that we say well we're we're this
[29:44] with that no
[29:46] we prove what we are if you don't pay
[29:49] tithe you're not a born-again believer
[29:54] i play on this over i ain't going to
[29:55] argue with you about this that or the
[29:57] other
[29:57] but i'm going to tell you this away and
[29:59] put it blunt and plain
[30:02] one dollar received means 10
[30:09] it don't say in the bible if you get it
[30:12] for this or get it for that
[30:13] there is two things in the bible you
[30:15] can't tithe on
[30:23] you can't tithe on the price of a
[30:28] well can't be done the bible says it
[30:32] you can't tithe on the price of a dog
[30:36] well brother dale i raise dogs and sell
[30:38] them you don't want no i don't want to
[30:39] tithe off you raising dogs and sell them
[30:41] because the bible says
[30:45] i want what the bible says we'll take
[30:47] care of the rest of it from our home you
[30:50] say yeah but
[30:51] well that's what the bible says now
[30:56] see then that would get us to the basis
[30:58] of of having understand it if we'd
[31:00] believe it
[31:01] and settle down to it and just be that
[31:02] and let it go and
[31:04] you know but setting things in order
[31:10] you know getting it to the bases see
[31:13] then every church must
[31:16] have a pastor
[31:21] all right now listen it's going to get
[31:23] down to try to hard
[31:25] charge things to try to understand
[31:28] it doesn't say that every church has to
[31:30] have a teacher
[31:34] it doesn't say that it has to have an
[31:36] apostle
[31:38] or prophet an evangelist
[31:41] but every church has to have a pastor
[31:45] because that's the rules of sitting down
[31:47] you say well my
[31:48] my pastor is brother so-and-so and he's
[31:50] he's a he's a teacher well what are you
[31:52] doing here
[31:54] well he's up in new york
[31:58] it's all right for me to send my money
[31:59] to new york the brother so and so
[32:03] it ain't all right in the bible but it's
[32:05] all right for me to do what you want to
[32:07] with it you can burn it
[32:09] because it ain't going to change me
[32:13] all right is that blunt enough it's not
[32:14] going to change me in anything that i do
[32:16] or don't do
[32:19] paying tithe is an opportunity
[32:23] it isn't it is a a uh what you call it
[32:26] it is a
[32:26] necessary thing to do
[32:30] but it is also a wonderful opportunity
[32:35] because if you pay your tithe he'll open
[32:37] the windows of heaven
[32:39] now come on i don't know if you you
[32:42] think what you want to
[32:45] but just remember you get a dollar
[32:50] one dime of that goes well
[32:53] brother dale i'm gonna do it this way
[32:55] that way now you're going to argue with
[32:57] god in the bible about it
[33:00] all right you say well i don't have to
[33:02] pay tithe on this to pay tithe on that
[33:04] the only two things in the bible you
[33:06] don't have to pay tithe on surprise of a
[33:07] or a dog
[33:10] now everything else does that well if i
[33:12] sell my home
[33:17] you sell your home and you get an
[33:22] increase
[33:24] you tie the increase you don't have to
[33:27] tie the whole thing
[33:29] you tie the increase we're sensible we
[33:32] know what we're doing we know what it
[33:33] all lays out to be
[33:38] you get things from people they give you
[33:41] an inheritance
[33:47] well i got an inheritance off the family
[33:50] well
[33:51] you're supposed to pay time
[33:54] come on church
[33:58] my boy said that time you know what it
[34:01] told his daddy
[34:02] brother dale never did preach on driving
[34:03] and the first thing the
[34:05] the time that his daddy came to church i
[34:08] preached on tithing
[34:11] but you see i wind up preaching on
[34:13] tithing of your time
[34:14] your talent your life you're praying
[34:18] you're worshiping you're singing you're
[34:20] doing
[34:21] money is just a little monetary thing to
[34:23] start with
[34:26] but if we don't keep stuff like that
[34:27] straight how can we call ourselves
[34:32] christians
[34:35] there was baptist we were in the baptist
[34:37] church we paid tithe
[34:43] you say well do i pay tithe on this time
[34:45] i ain't gonna argue with you about what
[34:47] you're talking about
[34:48] and that's exactly what you're wanting
[34:50] to do you're not wanting to say what's
[34:52] right
[34:54] you're not wanting to agree with the
[34:55] word that it says pay the tithe
[34:58] you're wanting to argue over how to do
[35:00] it well do it what you want to
[35:03] it's between you and god
[35:08] sensible between you and god not between
[35:11] me and you and god
[35:13] i ain't in on the show
[35:17] i've always said it and you don't you
[35:19] know this is the truth
[35:20] i just assume buy dinner for a
[35:24] millionaire
[35:25] is to buy a dinner for a parker
[35:28] he said well no no no no no no that
[35:30] dinner i'm i'm saying that's just the
[35:32] way i am
[35:34] because you see i don't honor one thing
[35:36] over the other
[35:39] all men are the same with me it doesn't
[35:42] matter
[35:46] you can't have let's put it this way
[35:48] let's start with the point
[35:50] you can't have a five-fold ministry
[35:55] without lining up starting with the
[35:56] pastor first
[35:59] now wait a minute the number so and so
[36:00] over in corinthians is in summer so this
[36:02] number goes in this way and then
[36:03] apostles and then prophets and then by
[36:06] you know it's fifo ministry irregardless
[36:11] so the tithe goes to the pastor that
[36:13] solves the problem
[36:16] now what he does with it is his problem
[36:21] it's not your problem
[36:26] it's his problem what he does with it if
[36:29] he don't handle that right then he's in
[36:31] trouble with god
[36:34] all right but you say well then i'll
[36:36] just pay my
[36:37] my tithe to the we we have a a teacher
[36:39] in our church i'll just pay my tithe a
[36:41] teacher
[36:42] that ain't according to the bible right
[36:46] there's only one man according to the
[36:48] bible that can teach either that's jesus
[36:49] christ
[36:51] you pay your tithe of jesus christ
[36:56] yeah but how do i pay my tithe to jesus
[36:58] christ when jesus ain't here
[37:04] you pay it to the next thing to him
[37:10] now you tell me now i'm not saying
[37:12] nothing other than just plain language
[37:15] but you tell me that brother branham
[37:17] could make a hundred dollars a week
[37:20] and spend fifteen 1500 a day
[37:23] out on the field somebody was
[37:28] giving money because he was
[37:31] the pastor now that's the way i count
[37:35] him
[37:36] account brother you want to know who is
[37:37] my pastor who is
[37:39] all of our pastor
[37:42] the elijah of this day the lord jesus
[37:45] christ
[37:46] is all of our pastors
[37:50] then you come down to as we tried to
[37:52] cover in a sermon or two there
[37:53] then you come down to brother branham
[37:59] well i sent my money to jeffersonville
[38:03] you can't pay tithe to a tape recorder
[38:08] quit saying you're going to send a
[38:09] jefferson but they'll sell you i'm
[38:10] sending it to somebody at jeffersonville
[38:12] because you can't pay tithe to a tape
[38:14] recorder
[38:17] you're going to do anything at least get
[38:18] your statement right
[38:21] i mean so well i just send mine to
[38:24] jeffersonville they do whatever
[38:26] you do what you want to do with it then
[38:29] but how is that your pastor
[38:32] you got to go through the local assembly
[38:38] to have a pastor
[38:44] so then what do we got we got a mixed-up
[38:46] mess is what really we've got because
[38:48] you ain't gonna get it running right the
[38:51] reason i don't preach on tithing and
[38:53] things
[38:53] is because it ain't gonna change nothing
[38:56] what i say today it ain't gonna change
[38:58] it's going to make you call each other
[39:00] this afternoon
[39:01] and want to know about this or that or
[39:04] the other or this week
[39:10] well i think this i think
[39:14] you think what you want to i'm just
[39:17] telling you what the word of god says
[39:20] we've got one pastor
[39:23] that's right we had one pastor in
[39:26] william branham
[39:28] his message is now our pastor
[39:32] because it's through the holy spirit
[39:34] revealing the word
[39:36] that was brought by the pastor and if
[39:38] you catch me off of the pastor
[39:40] off of the prophet's message you come
[39:42] and tell me
[39:47] we'll sit down and discuss this thing
[39:51] you say well i don't like the way you
[39:52] operate the church well it ain't none of
[39:54] your business
[39:57] is that blunt enough go somewhere
[40:00] else ain't none of your business what we
[40:04] do here
[40:06] because you're not in charge
[40:10] i'm in charge to line up everything i
[40:12] can by the message of the hour
[40:16] right then the 54 ministry has to line
[40:20] up
[40:22] with the message of the hour
[40:27] see then everything has to be lined up
[40:29] according to the word of god
[40:31] which the message of the hour is the
[40:32] word of god right
[40:34] that's why your high priest was the only
[40:36] one that was capable of receiving
[40:38] now they didn't get what i'm saying
[40:40] don't go to all
[40:42] playground with me get sensible
[40:45] when they brought in the money they
[40:47] didn't pile it all up in a high priest
[40:48] that turned
[40:50] no there was people at helps and
[40:52] governments and things that went away
[40:54] that there were people that helped him
[40:56] and
[40:56] took care of it he probably never seen
[40:59] 90
[41:00] of the money or even 100 of it maybe
[41:04] you know as the high priest he had
[41:07] people to help him that's why the bible
[41:09] talks
[41:09] in corinthians it gives you a line up
[41:12] coming down and it says
[41:13] and helps and governments and things
[41:20] because that's what we all have helps
[41:22] and governments
[41:24] all right you see what i'm talking about
[41:27] see when you
[41:27] when you do you try to explain something
[41:30] and people
[41:31] well you're just trying to do this
[41:39] i have seen the europe coming in pace
[41:42] that i gave away more money than most of
[41:43] you made
[41:45] and you know that is true
[41:51] there's no argument
[41:55] because i do what i want to do in the
[41:58] glory of god
[42:02] see then i do everything i can to give
[42:04] it all i know but you
[42:05] but brother dale you you you think i
[42:08] should do that you think i should tie
[42:09] this as a
[42:10] one dollar game 10 cent
[42:17] i can even go stronger
[42:21] brother asked me one day he said
[42:27] should i tithe the
[42:32] the money that
[42:35] i received it when my wife died
[42:47] anybody got question answers to it
[42:52] you know what i'm talking about he he
[42:54] had
[42:55] he had insurance
[43:00] you say what do you do well you tell me
[43:02] why not
[43:03] i ain't going to argue about what to do
[43:05] i'm going to tell you why not
[43:08] right yeah but that's getting it and see
[43:10] that's what i mean you're not gonna
[43:12] listen we
[43:13] we've said and had meetings about this
[43:14] before
[43:16] i'm just playing
[43:20] see i'm trying to show you one thing if
[43:22] we'll do it correctly god is in charge
[43:25] but he's in charge through a line of a
[43:28] chain that goes through
[43:29] that you've got a five-fold ministry but
[43:32] you start every church with a pastor
[43:35] you don't start that church with the
[43:38] teachers and things like that they're in
[43:40] the body of christ they're
[43:41] they're offering they're in on complete
[43:45] control of the pastor
[43:52] come on you explain it i'll give you the
[43:54] prophet
[43:57] but you tell me in the bible now let's
[43:59] keep it in there
[44:02] he says should i pay tithe on this one
[44:05] dollar game
[44:07] one day i'm tired
[44:11] yeah but you're getting this too too
[44:12] touchy about this especially when you're
[44:14] talking about say
[44:15] uh something that i received this word
[44:19] an increase you know
[44:23] of an insurance policy or something
[44:27] i'm just being played
[44:31] you tell me
[44:36] we'll be glad to give you the pulpit and
[44:38] say this is what sister so-and-so says
[44:41] you know but you know yourself i
[44:45] wouldn't even get up and answer it with
[44:46] that
[44:47] but i'll give it to you
[44:52] because i ain't trying to get rich off
[44:54] of the tithe
[44:57] you know how this church operates right
[45:00] well a lot of you don't because you
[45:02] claim you don't but you know more about
[45:03] it than i do cause you're nosy
[45:08] that one was rough
[45:11] that was too hard i guess
[45:15] but you see i'm responsible not only for
[45:18] your soul
[45:22] i'm responsible for god to god about
[45:24] your natural life
[45:30] did brother branham snake make these
[45:32] statements he said the pastor is the
[45:34] burden barrier
[45:38] well he gave someone how did he give
[45:40] them
[45:43] he gave a fifo ministry how to give them
[45:45] we can we can follow the tithe payer
[45:47] because we can
[45:48] take it to the pastor right and we can
[45:51] say well if we
[45:52] deal with this with a pastor
[45:58] but what about the other four ministries
[46:09] all right what about the other four
[46:12] apostles prophets you know teachers
[46:15] evangelists
[46:19] see they're responsible to god
[46:23] to find out what the five-fold ministry
[46:26] is supposed to be
[46:31] and they're supposed to get in that part
[46:32] of their job and do their job
[46:42] i mean you've got four more ministries
[46:43] there what are you going to do
[46:47] well don't you think that the apostle
[46:48] can and the teachers
[46:51] can receive tithe if they're a pastor of
[46:53] the church again
[46:57] that didn't come out right did it
[47:04] show me how anybody other than the
[47:05] pastor can receive tithe
[47:17] you say what but but you just you're
[47:19] just making it just
[47:23] making it plain always open for
[47:29] confrontations
[47:33] because i'm going to argue with you
[47:34] about it
[47:41] if this church had millions of dollars
[47:43] in the bank wouldn't change a thing to
[47:44] me
[47:49] i'd still preach the same thing or if it
[47:51] had two dollars in the bank i'd preach
[47:52] the same thing
[48:00] but you see i'm trying to get us to
[48:01] think about why does he say he gave some
[48:04] apostles
[48:05] some prophets some evangelists and
[48:06] teachers all right
[48:09] he gave a five-fold ministry all right
[48:13] now did you understand what we were
[48:15] trying to bring out last week or
[48:17] or this i pick hand-picked a few out of
[48:19] the notes for the past couple of
[48:21] services three or four
[48:22] for you to think on and i want to just
[48:25] read them to word that we can
[48:27] can see you know what is it go ahead
[48:30] pick up number one let's just read these
[48:32] things and see what brother branham said
[48:34] is odd the things that he says
[48:39] he covers the nine spiritual gifts in
[48:41] the local assembly
[48:48] but they don't come predestinated
[48:50] eternally
[48:52] because the gifts in that five in the
[48:55] nine spiritual gifts can operate one
[48:57] time and never operate again
[49:03] we're going to get down to something's
[49:04] going to stir your hair a little your
[49:06] spoon what is it
[49:07] you say aaron it's going to fall out of
[49:09] your bowl
[49:14] because we're going to read what the
[49:15] prophet says
[49:17] amen and then let's see if we will if we
[49:20] believe it
[49:22] all right now look what he says from
[49:23] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[49:25] and forever
[49:26] and macon then before you could do it
[49:29] now
[49:29] god does that then he sends people into
[49:32] the church
[49:32] such as preachers teachers evangelists
[49:36] gifts of healing don't mean the man now
[49:39] can heal you
[49:40] it means that he has faith in what he's
[49:43] talking about
[49:44] and proves it by the bible all right
[49:47] after that
[49:50] there's prophets that seers
[49:53] all those gifts are without repentance
[49:57] they god sent to that
[50:01] office gifts are this are sent by
[50:04] god now keep that in mind because that's
[50:08] what we're dealing with
[50:10] the five-fold ministry where either one
[50:13] of the five it's an
[50:14] office sin of god
[50:22] all right look how it gets god sends
[50:25] that
[50:26] office's gifts are sent by god for
[50:28] ordained of god
[50:31] and they're sent into the church they're
[50:34] born
[50:34] in you then tr them traits
[50:38] are born in you when you come to
[50:41] come to this world you just
[50:45] find your position now that's what i
[50:47] spent
[50:48] four sermons three sermons trying to get
[50:50] you to see
[50:51] that we're trying to find our place
[50:53] finding doing and what it
[50:55] you know find your position find what
[50:57] you're supposed to be
[50:58] get what your partner's doing do what
[51:00] you're supposed to do
[51:03] all right
[51:06] and all those things are in the kingdom
[51:08] of god
[51:10] and all of it's for the reflecting of
[51:12] the church
[51:14] to bring us together now listen
[51:19] office gifts
[51:24] the president of the united states is in
[51:26] an office
[51:32] he's got to abide by his office
[51:36] it's a position set up for something
[51:39] whatever you're doing and like i said
[51:40] president of the united states sheriff
[51:42] of the county or
[51:43] whatever it is whatever you want to
[51:44] would be setting up it's an
[51:48] office
[51:50] it's a gift the holy ghost
[51:54] is the office but it operates the gifts
[52:00] but remember the holy ghost is going to
[52:02] be the officer of all of them
[52:04] that's right but it's without repentance
[52:08] you don't repent to get a gift you're
[52:10] either born with it or not born with it
[52:13] and everybody is born in one way or the
[52:15] other with the gifts
[52:19] it don't work it doesn't mean you're
[52:21] born again to have gifts
[52:25] you're born with gifts
[52:29] but there's gifts in the body of christ
[52:31] that not necessarily are less important
[52:34] because
[52:34] the bible plainly tells you you know you
[52:36] say well this ain't important the bible
[52:38] plainly tells you the the last
[52:40] lesser amount of at least one is the
[52:42] most important of all
[52:43] so we ought to get that straight and
[52:45] that way it won't blow her head up so
[52:46] big
[52:47] that's right the least you can be is the
[52:49] best you can do
[52:51] because that's what it's supposed to be
[52:53] but gifts
[52:56] gifts in the in the bible are offices
[53:03] he gave us the new birth that is the
[53:06] office of the baptism of the holy ghost
[53:11] and he knew we would need leadership and
[53:13] helps and things
[53:14] so he gave us
[53:18] that new birth and putting that new
[53:20] birth together
[53:23] and it'll come out to be a church
[53:26] and then everybody should find their
[53:28] position
[53:31] of what they are you'll find your
[53:33] position was that what he said in there
[53:35] but listen go ahead and get to the next
[53:37] one
[53:40] sir as we would see jesus go away number
[53:42] two
[53:45] when jesus came on the scene the bible
[53:47] said that he was to be a prophet
[53:48] moses said the lord your god shall rise
[53:51] up a prophet like and unto me
[53:54] and israel always believed that they're
[53:56] prophets
[53:58] because that was god
[54:01] brother branham was god to the people
[54:04] not brother branham
[54:06] we'll get to that in a minute it is not
[54:09] the person that comes predestinated
[54:12] eternally from god
[54:16] right it's not the person brother
[54:18] branham didn't come predestinated
[54:20] eternally from god
[54:25] he said well i've heard you might think
[54:27] no i didn't make it
[54:28] he was predestinated eternally because
[54:31] it's not
[54:34] the fifo ministry is predestinated
[54:38] to bring the message as well as the
[54:40] prophet is predestinated that's
[54:42] one thing we don't dwell on a lot
[54:47] but i try to put it in the right place
[54:49] irregardless of what
[54:51] ministry you've got it still has to
[54:53] answer to the prophet
[54:56] then that has to answer to god
[54:59] so everything is answering to him so i
[55:01] what always believed their prophets
[55:03] because that was god identifying himself
[55:05] in human beings
[55:07] see he would go in that human being and
[55:09] speak to his people
[55:11] i believe that about it brother brown
[55:13] said it's hard to separate the man from
[55:15] the
[55:16] ministry
[55:20] he said that way you'll make too much of
[55:21] the man
[55:24] because it is not the person that comes
[55:26] pre-designated eternal but what did he
[55:27] say in the church
[55:28] it's the word or
[55:33] and seed was a predestinated seed for
[55:35] every age
[55:37] a predestinated word forever age
[55:42] a predestinated group of people forever
[55:44] age
[55:46] a predestinated 5-4 ministry forever age
[55:55] it's predestinated
[55:58] god sent it nine spiritual gifts we'll
[56:03] read in a minute
[56:03] they come and go
[56:07] but the fifo ministry is not so
[56:14] the fifo minister is predestinated
[56:16] eternally now listen
[56:18] not the man the seed he's bringing the
[56:21] word he's bringing
[56:22] or let me say it this way can i add
[56:24] something without you
[56:25] blowing your head off about it why not
[56:29] write a little word in there where he
[56:30] says the predestinated
[56:32] word or seed why not put a little word
[56:35] there called an office
[56:43] the office is operational part of the
[56:45] holy ghost into your heart and life
[56:47] it is not you
[56:52] the baptism of the holy ghost is not you
[56:55] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[57:01] right well now how can you separate the
[57:05] crisis in you from the christ you can't
[57:07] ain't not even trying to leave it alone
[57:12] but you see regular gifts can operate in
[57:14] the body of christ
[57:16] and they're wonderful they are ordained
[57:19] of god
[57:20] right they're there for a purpose
[57:28] but it is not the word or seed left up
[57:30] to them to bring
[57:37] the messenger to each church age brought
[57:39] the message the fivefold ministry was to
[57:42] line up with everything he said
[57:46] now everything he said that was right
[57:49] let's be technical we don't line up to
[57:53] something that oh
[57:54] so and so over here priests that we
[57:55] don't believe in it
[57:57] no forget it cast that out
[58:06] but let's get into it in the way it's
[58:08] supposed to be himself in the bible
[58:10] always that's the way that
[58:12] he identified himself was in his
[58:14] prophets they were just ordinary man of
[58:16] course they were
[58:17] born for that purpose
[58:20] now what as we know
[58:24] there is local gifts of the nine
[58:28] spiritual nine gifts in the church
[58:30] that's first corinthians 12
[58:33] lists the 12 of them i mean the nine of
[58:35] them
[58:36] aren't now watch there is local
[58:39] gifts of nine gifts in the church but
[58:42] there
[58:43] is offices of the church
[58:47] and that god that's predestinated
[58:51] or foreign god has said in the church
[58:55] apostles then prophets and teachers
[58:57] pastors evangelists
[58:58] and so forth that's god's gifts set into
[59:01] the church
[59:02] then there is nine spiritual gifts
[59:06] that operate in the local body of the
[59:09] believers
[59:10] and they must be checked what you don't
[59:12] check the fifo ministry
[59:13] you don't check the profit of the age
[59:18] you mean i i i don't work you show me
[59:21] what you've got a right to check me with
[59:23] come and let's do it with this
[59:28] you want to talk to me about checking to
[59:30] see whether what i'm saying is right or
[59:31] not
[59:32] you're to have it in you enough to know
[59:34] that i read it
[59:38] i don't just guess it and play with it i
[59:40] read it
[59:42] so if i read it to you it's what he said
[59:44] at least
[59:46] right because now look
[59:51] nine spiritual gifts that operate in the
[59:53] local body
[59:55] and of of believers and they must be
[59:58] checked by two or three judges
[1:00:00] before they're to be given to the church
[1:00:02] because sometimes they would be wrong
[1:00:06] but notice these prophets now okay
[1:00:09] going back to the old testament prophets
[1:00:11] going back to the brother branham being
[1:00:13] a prophet going back to the church age
[1:00:15] messenger of being a special person
[1:00:17] whether it be paul iranius martin
[1:00:19] columbo
[1:00:20] special person for the word of the age
[1:00:22] that they're bringing
[1:00:26] not like brother branham no even agaves
[1:00:28] again was brought around and speaks high
[1:00:30] of agaves
[1:00:31] but agaves was nowhere close to paul
[1:00:34] right right
[1:00:37] right but paul was nowhere close to
[1:00:41] the elijah of this last days
[1:00:45] that's the way i believe it
[1:00:50] paul was wonderful and great and the
[1:00:53] messenger to the
[1:00:54] whole new testament is laid upon the
[1:00:57] apostle paul
[1:00:58] let alone the church at ephesus
[1:01:01] but yet he couldn't bring the seals he
[1:01:04] couldn't bring the things that needed to
[1:01:05] be brought
[1:01:07] it had to come through the malachi 4.
[1:01:11] so we've got it laid in right order okay
[1:01:14] notice these prophets as they were born
[1:01:16] like in
[1:01:17] i believe in jeremiah here god said
[1:01:19] before you was even conceived
[1:01:21] in your mother's wound i ordained you a
[1:01:24] prophet
[1:01:25] over the nations now listen you say but
[1:01:28] that
[1:01:29] is predestinating
[1:01:34] you're playing with the word
[1:01:36] predestinating
[1:01:41] you're not listening let's read it again
[1:01:46] before you were even conceived in your
[1:01:48] mother's womb
[1:01:51] that's back before the foundation of the
[1:01:52] world
[1:01:57] you're going to see one of these days
[1:01:59] what i'm trying to tell you
[1:02:01] and it's going to open this church up
[1:02:03] empty it or it's going to
[1:02:05] bring together what we're supposed to
[1:02:06] have
[1:02:08] i'm a firm believer in the fifo ministry
[1:02:13] i'm a firm believer in that but i'm a
[1:02:14] firm believer in all the local assembly
[1:02:17] operating as a local local assembly i'm
[1:02:20] a firm believer in the nine spiritual
[1:02:22] gifts it's supposed to be in the
[1:02:24] ever-born ever uh assembly
[1:02:27] nine spiritual gifts operating but i
[1:02:29] remember you can call and use it for the
[1:02:30] perfecting of the saints
[1:02:33] they're there they're wonderful but if
[1:02:36] you look at what i'm talking about then
[1:02:37] you move up from that that part has to
[1:02:39] be judged
[1:02:40] what he said that has to be judged has
[1:02:41] to be done
[1:02:43] but the fifo ministry is not judged
[1:02:48] we're going to judge us with
[1:02:53] hey come on now now come on brother they
[1:02:55] are you know smarter than you think
[1:02:57] or dumber one you know brother dale's
[1:03:01] saying one thing for
[1:03:02] certain it ain't me and you
[1:03:07] that god gave to the church sorry
[1:03:10] he didn't give me he gave a gift
[1:03:16] he didn't give any of you fifo ministry
[1:03:19] he gave the gift
[1:03:22] he gave the office
[1:03:28] he gave you the to the church but it's
[1:03:31] not you it's the office you're in
[1:03:36] he honors his office
[1:03:40] come on you see moses was born a prophet
[1:03:43] in john the baptist
[1:03:44] 712 years before he was born he was the
[1:03:46] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:03:48] isaiah the prophet speaking
[1:03:49] to him see it's not these gifts are born
[1:03:52] gifts
[1:03:53] god placing them in the church
[1:04:00] what gifts he gives the nine spiritual
[1:04:04] gifts
[1:04:07] but the nine spiritual gifts are i don't
[1:04:09] like to use the word unimportant because
[1:04:12] it's not that it's just it's a a point
[1:04:14] of what one
[1:04:15] section does and compared to what
[1:04:17] another
[1:04:18] you know group does and the best way to
[1:04:22] compare it is is the way the prophet
[1:04:23] compared it
[1:04:24] and when he said that the nine spiritual
[1:04:27] gifts
[1:04:27] has to be judged
[1:04:34] but show me where he said the fivefold
[1:04:36] ministry had to be judged
[1:04:41] and we're not talking about the man
[1:04:42] that's what i was saying a while ago
[1:04:44] that's what i was getting to what i've
[1:04:46] been getting to what
[1:04:47] it is not the person that comes
[1:04:49] predestinated eternally from god
[1:04:51] but word or seed or office
[1:04:54] did i add anything to the message
[1:04:58] office an office of god
[1:05:09] that ain't no little room over there
[1:05:10] that's the pastor's office
[1:05:13] you know mine's been moved so far still
[1:05:16] a lot of times i forget where i'm
[1:05:17] supposed to go to
[1:05:20] and then we had went back there one time
[1:05:22] they was all fussing around here that's
[1:05:24] why they added on that over there it
[1:05:25] didn't bother me
[1:05:27] i had enough room to wear that it was
[1:05:30] really funny i was in a little bitty
[1:05:31] place
[1:05:32] packed up in the corner and we had this
[1:05:35] lady
[1:05:35] all of you know the stories about it but
[1:05:37] this lady came in
[1:05:38] and she was telling them up here at the
[1:05:40] front and said i want to talk to the
[1:05:42] pastor
[1:05:44] well i heard her back there and i just
[1:05:47] stepped out i said solve the problem in
[1:05:48] other words send her on down
[1:05:50] tell my wife to come with her i had a
[1:05:53] big office
[1:05:54] i had an office with a chair that i
[1:05:56] could barely turn around
[1:06:00] you know and that lady got in that
[1:06:03] doorway
[1:06:06] and there was no way for me and her boat
[1:06:08] go back out that door
[1:06:11] you know so i had to talk to her you
[1:06:13] know
[1:06:14] i had to tell her because she's saying
[1:06:15] we need to lift up jesus i said if
[1:06:17] you'll hang around a little while you'll
[1:06:18] find out
[1:06:19] we do i said just hang around go sit
[1:06:23] down for a little while
[1:06:24] need some money we'll give you a little
[1:06:26] money go sit down
[1:06:28] oh we need this i see how you're sorry
[1:06:30] you need that
[1:06:31] but you'll find out we left up jesus
[1:06:33] christ the one true and living god
[1:06:35] well but i went through the godhead and
[1:06:37] just a little bit and first thing i know
[1:06:39] she was out the door
[1:06:43] well i didn't argue and fuss with her i
[1:06:44] just quote the bible to her
[1:06:48] what you see is she was in my office
[1:06:51] mine was getting crowded with her in
[1:06:53] there and peggy standing in the doorway
[1:06:56] but it worked out it always will
[1:07:00] i ain't afraid of something like that
[1:07:01] it'll always work out you just start
[1:07:03] talking about the bible
[1:07:05] right and watch that demon just start
[1:07:10] backing off of you okay come on but
[1:07:13] listen
[1:07:14] gifts are born gifts god placing them in
[1:07:17] the church
[1:07:20] you think about that as your fifo
[1:07:21] ministry now i'm talking to the church
[1:07:23] now
[1:07:25] which i've already explained see we're
[1:07:27] all fivefold ministry
[1:07:28] we're in the body of christ i've got to
[1:07:30] have a pastor
[1:07:32] right i'm the pastor of the church but i
[1:07:35] got to have a pastor
[1:07:36] what have i got i got all these five
[1:07:37] full ministers i got these ministers
[1:07:39] who do you pay your tithe to when
[1:07:40] somebody comes through from somewhere i
[1:07:42] give them money
[1:07:43] i do this i give these brothers to
[1:07:45] minister
[1:07:50] because i've got to what would be a
[1:07:54] pastor that wouldn't honor the word
[1:07:56] enough to do what it says
[1:07:58] but you want everybody else to
[1:08:01] you can't send your money i've had
[1:08:03] people here to tell me
[1:08:04] one brother one time he said you care if
[1:08:07] i give my
[1:08:09] uh give us tithe money to this brother i
[1:08:12] said give him everything you got
[1:08:16] i think no problem just give it to him
[1:08:18] but i said now if you're asking me
[1:08:20] what's right
[1:08:23] now we're going to change the story
[1:08:25] right right if you ask me what's right
[1:08:27] then you have no right to send it
[1:08:28] nowhere
[1:08:28] else the everything is supposed to be
[1:08:32] operating from that
[1:08:34] one single
[1:08:37] right yeah but what about the other four
[1:08:40] the other four has to offer has to
[1:08:42] answer to that pastor
[1:08:44] and the other four should be called in
[1:08:47] see i call in people i see something
[1:08:49] you know we have a wonderful ministry
[1:08:51] here
[1:08:52] we have a great situation we've got four
[1:08:55] ministers besides myself
[1:08:57] uh that works out good you know we can
[1:08:59] just schedule the different weeks and
[1:09:00] things like that but i also think and
[1:09:02] sometimes and i think well
[1:09:04] we need you know we used to to bring in
[1:09:06] until all this
[1:09:08] virus got hooked up but we you know i
[1:09:10] used to bring in ministers well i
[1:09:12] i'd get to thinking about so and so i
[1:09:13] just called him once they come down and
[1:09:14] preach for us
[1:09:16] because i believe in the faithful
[1:09:18] ministry
[1:09:20] i believe that's where i get my
[1:09:25] i get mine from the prophet's message by
[1:09:27] way of the faithful ministry
[1:09:31] now can every one of you ministers say
[1:09:32] amen to that
[1:09:34] i get mine from the fifo ministry
[1:09:38] that's got it from the prophet
[1:09:43] that way all's involved right that's why
[1:09:46] he gave some a prophet
[1:09:48] some apostles see
[1:09:52] so you'll see sometimes you watch these
[1:09:55] brothers minister
[1:09:57] you know and you watch especially
[1:09:59] brother say
[1:10:00] we'll use brother aaron he don't mind
[1:10:01] he'll get mad at me but
[1:10:04] you see him he'll be up preaching and
[1:10:06] he'll be just going away and about that
[1:10:08] time he hits that rabbit trail
[1:10:10] and he just runs away over here and he
[1:10:13] get off over here and he gets to running
[1:10:15] this away and
[1:10:16] don't worry about he'll come back you
[1:10:19] know right awhile you'll see him line
[1:10:21] back
[1:10:21] up well see something was going on
[1:10:25] i don't think it to be him chasing
[1:10:27] rabbits
[1:10:29] i take it to be that god is leading him
[1:10:31] to go over here
[1:10:34] and then to move back and bring it this
[1:10:36] way you watch these ministers one
[1:10:38] message they'll be on fire
[1:10:41] they're really on fire next minute
[1:10:43] they're slow gradual
[1:10:45] well if you'd listen to them and let
[1:10:46] them tell you in a hurry just like i
[1:10:48] would
[1:10:49] do you think man oh man that was the
[1:10:51] worst sermon
[1:10:53] that i've ever preached you know
[1:10:57] i mean you're just down and out
[1:11:01] you just you go outside and
[1:11:05] i enjoyed that message brother dale i've
[1:11:07] been studying on this right here
[1:11:08] and then you thank me that's what i told
[1:11:11] that sister that time when she
[1:11:13] she was telling me some things you know
[1:11:15] what i was doing and all i said
[1:11:17] you needed to preach tonight let me sit
[1:11:19] down
[1:11:22] because she done a better job explaining
[1:11:23] it in five minutes and i did an hour and
[1:11:25] a half
[1:11:27] i believe in gifts working i believe in
[1:11:29] gifts working through the body of christ
[1:11:31] the women the men the children
[1:11:34] i believe in that and that's not
[1:11:38] building one above the other
[1:11:42] but all right you see what i'm talking
[1:11:44] about maybe one time aaron is up here
[1:11:46] he's far borrowed he's
[1:11:47] he's an evangelist the next service he
[1:11:51] might be
[1:11:51] slow you'd look at him and you follow
[1:11:53] him he's doing a good teaching job
[1:11:55] tonight
[1:11:58] he said didn't change his office you
[1:12:01] hear brother branham
[1:12:03] right he'll be preaching away in one
[1:12:06] message
[1:12:08] and he'll be just on fire in the next
[1:12:11] message
[1:12:12] it's real slow he's gradually going and
[1:12:16] you know which one are you going to say
[1:12:18] is most led of god
[1:12:20] most of the time the one that everybody
[1:12:22] thinks he ain't led is is the one that's
[1:12:23] being led
[1:12:24] right right yeah so you just do the best
[1:12:28] you can
[1:12:31] see five full ministry he gave some
[1:12:34] apostles
[1:12:35] it's not all made for the pastor just to
[1:12:37] be the only preacher
[1:12:41] that's not made for that so now listen
[1:12:45] to what i'm saying for a minute and
[1:12:46] you'll get it right and you'll see i'm
[1:12:47] trying to honor everybody
[1:12:49] when i'm sitting back there in that pew
[1:12:51] looking up here
[1:12:52] every who's doing that preaching is my
[1:12:54] pastor
[1:13:01] how many of you give me that honor
[1:13:05] well see you're my pastor while i'm
[1:13:06] sitting there feeding on the word
[1:13:12] what because that's the five-fold
[1:13:15] ministry
[1:13:16] it's not all made for one
[1:13:21] it's made to operate as a body of christ
[1:13:25] read the the corinthians and the arms
[1:13:28] the legs
[1:13:28] these are supposed to move everything's
[1:13:30] not a hand everything's not an eye
[1:13:32] everything's not an ear
[1:13:33] read those things you might get a good
[1:13:36] understanding of
[1:13:37] what's going on
[1:13:41] because i've got to have a five-fold
[1:13:44] ministry
[1:13:46] i called in people when others around me
[1:13:48] and say what'd you get that
[1:13:50] for well
[1:13:53] i wanted to you know it felt like it
[1:13:59] it's always been wonderful
[1:14:02] i can say this with not bragging or
[1:14:04] whatever
[1:14:06] i've called in people here to preach at
[1:14:08] this church that i knew there was
[1:14:09] doctrinal issues that i didn't agree
[1:14:11] with them
[1:14:13] but i knew they would help you and i had
[1:14:17] one time that i know of
[1:14:20] i've had one time that i had to come
[1:14:24] back behind the man
[1:14:26] after he left and correct what he taught
[1:14:28] to this church
[1:14:34] now that's an honor
[1:14:38] maybe they honored the old boy enough to
[1:14:40] say let's stay away from that
[1:14:42] you know he'll straighten it out when i
[1:14:43] leave
[1:14:46] but you see what i'm talking about
[1:14:50] i think when brother aaron is preaching
[1:14:53] he's our pastor for the night
[1:14:58] you thought i was doing it all on the
[1:15:00] pastor didn't you
[1:15:02] i'm putting it where i believe the word
[1:15:04] puts it
[1:15:07] so we need something brother bob is
[1:15:09] going to preach this afternoon
[1:15:11] i'm going to come here and sit down and
[1:15:12] say god feed
[1:15:14] my soul this is a member of the fifo
[1:15:17] ministry
[1:15:18] that is to talk to me i may be the
[1:15:21] pastor
[1:15:23] that's all right but he's whatever is
[1:15:26] needed this afternoon
[1:15:27] he is to bring that to the congregation
[1:15:30] and that puts the whole 54 ministry to
[1:15:32] work
[1:15:36] you don't listen to types enough if you
[1:15:39] don't understand what i'm talking about
[1:15:40] because you know brother branham a lot
[1:15:42] of times
[1:15:42] he'll just be on fire but then in the
[1:15:45] next message he just
[1:15:52] i've always said this but it's it's the
[1:15:54] now the hear you him messages now we
[1:15:56] know what that's supposed to mean and
[1:15:57] connect
[1:15:58] and hear him but get your titles and
[1:16:01] look at all of them and get the tapes
[1:16:02] and listen
[1:16:03] he ain't always preaching on adoption
[1:16:07] he's titling to hear him you think oh
[1:16:09] that's an adoption let me get that and
[1:16:11] that's the doc
[1:16:12] no he ain't always doing that
[1:16:15] he's just saying here god which is an
[1:16:18] adoption message right
[1:16:20] glory but still he's just not trying to
[1:16:22] bring down this over here and this over
[1:16:24] here
[1:16:25] and you listen to him sometimes and you
[1:16:27] think well i've heard him explain that
[1:16:28] over here
[1:16:29] one time over here a whole lot better
[1:16:31] than that well you don't know who's
[1:16:33] there
[1:16:35] and who's listening or what's changing
[1:16:36] it because it'll change it
[1:16:39] you watch you watch it up here sometime
[1:16:40] that's why i walk back and forth
[1:16:42] i go this way weight goes that way see
[1:16:44] uh bob he's getting he's getting a bit
[1:16:47] and now aaron he hangs in the middle
[1:16:50] really because
[1:16:50] he's so big he can't move around he's
[1:16:54] you know he has to stay with his feet
[1:16:56] anchored
[1:16:58] what you see
[1:17:02] i move but you know why i move sometimes
[1:17:08] these preachers can understand it the
[1:17:10] laity don't agree with it but
[1:17:11] because you don't know you start out in
[1:17:14] a service
[1:17:15] and you see a preacher and he's
[1:17:16] preaching away and he's he's doing
[1:17:18] pretty good he's right in the middle you
[1:17:19] know
[1:17:20] he's doing pretty good night while you
[1:17:21] see him and he starts
[1:17:25] and he starts moving over and he'll try
[1:17:28] to move back
[1:17:29] he'll try to go this away and it just
[1:17:32] don't work
[1:17:33] he's got that notch over here and he
[1:17:36] comes back over here
[1:17:37] and he's preaching you know what
[1:17:38] happened the pool
[1:17:41] has come to that one side maybe one
[1:17:44] person
[1:17:49] maybe one person is pulling
[1:17:54] and that gift is trying to answer that
[1:17:56] question
[1:17:58] talk to that soul of that individual
[1:18:01] through that gift
[1:18:03] which is in an office
[1:18:12] that's just trying to explain gifts and
[1:18:14] ministries and stuff
[1:18:16] you can't do it because we're odd people
[1:18:21] but get to the point of what i'm talking
[1:18:24] about
[1:18:26] you if you have a need
[1:18:31] you just pray
[1:18:35] all right and you just you just keep
[1:18:38] praying
[1:18:40] about that need and about that time
[1:18:43] brother louise will call and say
[1:18:46] i'm not going to be able to preach this
[1:18:47] weekend i'm scheduled but
[1:18:49] uh they're they want me to come here to
[1:18:51] interpret well we always honor that
[1:18:53] it's okay go ahead you know
[1:18:58] you know that might be the will of the
[1:18:59] lord for brother bob to preach that
[1:19:01] night
[1:19:03] you don't think like that and god went
[1:19:06] through all these other things to get
[1:19:08] that one minister here
[1:19:13] see it's an office
[1:19:17] a gift a word
[1:19:23] a position because that's what an office
[1:19:26] is
[1:19:27] it's a position it's something set aside
[1:19:30] you're in that position nobody's in that
[1:19:32] position
[1:19:32] it's not a room sitting over there
[1:19:34] somewhere it's called an office that's
[1:19:36] just examples
[1:19:37] it's a person that's in that office
[1:19:44] you see that's where i don't it doesn't
[1:19:46] bother it never has bothered me who i
[1:19:47] preach in front of
[1:19:49] yeah but brother dale when when brother
[1:19:51] moat was here i believe it i
[1:19:54] give honor to where honors do to me
[1:19:56] brother moat was the greatest teacher in
[1:19:58] this message outside of brother brown
[1:20:00] for this age and time
[1:20:01] i ain't talking about down in this and
[1:20:03] that brother vote was a teacher
[1:20:05] in the body of christ i believe that
[1:20:10] and i believe by me honoring that he and
[1:20:12] god honored me
[1:20:15] and he pulled me into positions and
[1:20:17] things by that
[1:20:18] right i believe that all right some of
[1:20:22] you
[1:20:22] just to show you the difference brother
[1:20:24] mo he had his way and we were
[1:20:27] we were over a certain place and and
[1:20:29] this brother got up and he said uh
[1:20:33] we're glad to have brother molten with
[1:20:34] us here tonight said he's he's uh
[1:20:36] he's gonna come said you know how he is
[1:20:38] that he's he's deep in that word
[1:20:40] that he he teaches and he does and it's
[1:20:43] that and the other
[1:20:44] and he said now tomorrow night we're
[1:20:45] going to have
[1:20:50] see what was coming tomorrow night was a
[1:20:52] man that was really built up high moving
[1:20:54] going you know and jumping and shout he
[1:20:56] said we'll shatter all over this place
[1:20:59] said we'll shout up down these aisles
[1:21:01] and we'll run aisles
[1:21:03] and then he just realized that he'd
[1:21:05] opened it up the wrong way on that side
[1:21:07] and he was degrading brother mulci so
[1:21:09] this is where he said it
[1:21:11] he said brother moat's telling us about
[1:21:12] the word
[1:21:14] and said tomorrow night we'll know what
[1:21:15] to shout about
[1:21:18] he got it back together but listen
[1:21:22] church
[1:21:24] a fifo ministry an office
[1:21:28] think of that now now let me illustrate
[1:21:31] it all right
[1:21:33] then we have bob terrence wade
[1:21:38] who's that how many deacons we got three
[1:21:41] and we've got three deacons
[1:21:43] all right that's an office
[1:21:46] see that's an office they're set aside
[1:21:49] for a certain thing
[1:21:52] all right but that doesn't make it to
[1:21:54] where they can preach it but it makes
[1:21:56] them
[1:21:56] the bible said apt to teach they can do
[1:21:59] things they can come into
[1:22:01] and teach and and do this and that and
[1:22:03] the other through the deacon part
[1:22:05] because that's the bible
[1:22:11] but that's an office
[1:22:15] all right now
[1:22:18] just the esther plays a piano
[1:22:22] in the nine spiritual gift line that's
[1:22:25] an office
[1:22:27] but it's not an office to take her all
[1:22:29] the way up to where she can come out and
[1:22:30] preach
[1:22:32] they'd be getting out of her office she
[1:22:34] has her office she has to do
[1:22:35] you have your doing this is lisa
[1:22:39] she handles the the uh the secretary
[1:22:41] treasurer part
[1:22:42] that's an office in the five in the nine
[1:22:45] spiritual gifts
[1:22:46] but it didn't put her into the preaching
[1:22:50] ministry
[1:22:52] well yeah it can be an office but it's
[1:22:54] an office and a uh
[1:22:55] what would you call it just a form to be
[1:22:57] used because the prophet was
[1:23:00] explained he said he can take that and
[1:23:02] use that gift one time
[1:23:04] and never use it again but he doesn't
[1:23:08] say that about the five-fold ministry
[1:23:11] that's the point i'm trying to get each
[1:23:13] one gets greater and greater in
[1:23:15] uh the office use
[1:23:19] and more settled in what that's
[1:23:20] happening in that office
[1:23:23] all right you've got to take a a deacon
[1:23:25] he can teach in the capacity of that
[1:23:27] part he can do that part
[1:23:28] because that's part of it but that don't
[1:23:30] make him a preacher
[1:23:34] well yeah god can use him because he's a
[1:23:37] deacon he's set aside for that part and
[1:23:39] can be used
[1:23:40] all right but the next part is another
[1:23:42] office higher form see to come into the
[1:23:44] fifo ministry
[1:23:46] and come on church i don't mind saying
[1:23:48] it i know it
[1:23:50] you don't like for me to make these
[1:23:51] statements but there's a lot of pastors
[1:23:54] in this church i i mean in this
[1:23:56] message end time that i wouldn't drive
[1:23:58] two miles to get them here and preach
[1:24:01] because i don't agree with them huh
[1:24:06] and then sometimes i wonder how you
[1:24:07] could listen to them
[1:24:10] because i'm wondering don't you hear
[1:24:11] what i hear
[1:24:14] but i've told people so and so said i
[1:24:16] never heard him say that
[1:24:19] well you must have went to sleep
[1:24:22] because that's just exactly what he said
[1:24:24] there the other night
[1:24:27] i told one sister one time i said you
[1:24:30] shouted
[1:24:31] all over i thought i was helping her
[1:24:33] doing because i was her pastor
[1:24:35] and i said you shouted all over the
[1:24:37] place that night and that brother was
[1:24:39] preaching and i said his biggest portion
[1:24:41] of his message was era
[1:24:44] i mean even bad you know error
[1:24:49] well she solved the problem
[1:24:52] i wasn't her pastor no more she didn't
[1:24:54] come back no more
[1:24:56] well that's what i'm saying to you
[1:25:03] see you you gather to whatever is
[1:25:06] feeding you're feeding on that's where
[1:25:08] the
[1:25:08] i'll give you a fivefold ministry
[1:25:12] but what if you don't have but a pastor
[1:25:16] well he can do fulfill no now don't do
[1:25:18] that don't
[1:25:19] don't run off and say he can fulfill all
[1:25:21] of them now brother branham could
[1:25:23] i can't
[1:25:26] brother branham could fulfill all the
[1:25:28] five-fold officers i can't
[1:25:30] and one minister by myself you can't
[1:25:33] either
[1:25:34] that's as blunt as i can put it
[1:25:37] but see you can move over into a gift
[1:25:40] part of it
[1:25:41] and things can work i can go out and and
[1:25:44] minister to
[1:25:45] somewhere and go to a church and not
[1:25:47] preach you know
[1:25:50] i'm not out there well if
[1:25:54] you don't like it around here you ought
[1:25:55] to find you another pastor
[1:25:57] my number is someone said john's okay
[1:26:00] you know no
[1:26:02] you say that's really it is
[1:26:06] but it's getting the point across at one
[1:26:07] time
[1:26:10] we've got to have the five full ministry
[1:26:12] see you thought i was just talking it
[1:26:14] the other way
[1:26:14] taking parts to try to explain it
[1:26:17] there's no way to explain
[1:26:19] god in his works works what he's doing
[1:26:23] he uses what he uses
[1:26:26] you must look at that and honor it
[1:26:29] i wish you would go now i'm just serious
[1:26:31] as i can be about it
[1:26:33] because i've been just a few little
[1:26:34] places but i wish you'd go to some of
[1:26:35] these foreign countries
[1:26:38] and look how much that pastor is honored
[1:26:45] look how that minister is honored in
[1:26:48] that congregation
[1:26:50] well if it right no we're not talking
[1:26:52] about that i tried to make that plain to
[1:26:55] start with
[1:26:55] we ain't talking about garbage can fifo
[1:26:58] ministries
[1:27:00] we're talking about what's supposed to
[1:27:02] be the real call of god
[1:27:07] but i'll give you the quote where the
[1:27:08] prophet said as you honor your pastor
[1:27:11] so god honors you
[1:27:16] well brother dale you want me to pat you
[1:27:18] on the back no but it does feel pretty
[1:27:20] good
[1:27:24] i mean you know i do like to hear it
[1:27:28] every once in a while
[1:27:28] brother i enjoyed that message i didn't
[1:27:31] give them one
[1:27:32] word well that's no problem
[1:27:36] but you understand what i'm talking
[1:27:38] about put the the word office in there
[1:27:40] with the fifo ministry because that's
[1:27:42] what your profit i got a bunch more here
[1:27:44] not enough time to cover but covering it
[1:27:47] the gifts and how the gifts are working
[1:27:50] in the
[1:27:51] local assembly brother brown said a
[1:27:53] pastor would have to answer
[1:27:54] if the gift was not working in that
[1:27:58] assembly
[1:28:00] well i'll have to answer it that's
[1:28:03] that's why you've never seen me set
[1:28:04] nobody down
[1:28:09] i had one incident this brother he said
[1:28:11] i can speak in tongues anytime i want to
[1:28:14] i said not according to the bible
[1:28:17] the bible says as the spirit giveth
[1:28:19] utterance
[1:28:22] i said besides you're just speaking in
[1:28:23] tongues i mean just speaking in spanish
[1:28:28] and he got upset and left well it must
[1:28:31] have been right
[1:28:34] but he was just speaking in spanish and
[1:28:35] everybody was thinking he was speaking
[1:28:37] in tongues
[1:28:38] and i don't know one word except c
[1:28:43] but i had enough sense to know what he
[1:28:44] was doing
[1:28:47] see church i'm trying my best to to get
[1:28:49] you to see
[1:28:50] the part that you need to honor and what
[1:28:52] you need to not honor
[1:28:54] right we honor god's word and the truth
[1:28:58] that he brings to us through the fifo
[1:29:00] ministry
[1:29:00] that was brought to us by a prophet of
[1:29:03] god we're not looking for another
[1:29:05] prophet to come
[1:29:06] to be able to do that we are not looking
[1:29:09] for the fivefold ministry
[1:29:10] to raise up and take the place of the
[1:29:12] prophet because it will never work
[1:29:18] but we are what are you looking for i'm
[1:29:20] looking for the body of
[1:29:21] jesus christ to rise up
[1:29:27] i believe in the body of jesus christ
[1:29:31] as being god himself operating in the
[1:29:33] church
[1:29:37] that gives honor to everybody men women
[1:29:39] children everything
[1:29:41] amen because
[1:29:45] it is the body paul spends his time in
[1:29:48] corinthians read there
[1:29:50] i was telling somebody the other day
[1:29:51] about it it's hard sometimes me to read
[1:29:53] corinthians especially in the early
[1:29:55] parts of the first corinthians because
[1:29:57] he seems like he's just telling stories
[1:29:59] it just seemed like he's telling this
[1:30:01] it's telling that
[1:30:03] and you got to get on over into the book
[1:30:04] before you realize hey he was telling
[1:30:06] the story he's telling stories about me
[1:30:08] he was telling what i need to be
[1:30:15] operational but you understand do i need
[1:30:17] to read any more about offices
[1:30:20] or do you want to just you go home and
[1:30:23] type in office and put in ministry
[1:30:29] but it'll cut it down you go to office
[1:30:31] you're going to have a sling
[1:30:32] and just put ministry brother brown says
[1:30:36] there's
[1:30:36] five ministerial gifts
[1:30:41] there is not one pastor and the rest
[1:30:47] nothing no it's all the same
[1:30:53] yeah but the pastors are not the deeper
[1:30:55] ones i can quote i know what brother
[1:30:57] brown says about an adoption
[1:31:00] where your pastors want to do this out
[1:31:02] in the other but said that teacher he
[1:31:03] set you in order
[1:31:05] but i also remember some more where he
[1:31:08] said your pastor
[1:31:10] is ordained to lead you through
[1:31:13] i know how to quote the rest of that he
[1:31:15] said if he's ordained
[1:31:19] he put it in the correct order your
[1:31:22] pastor is ordained to carry you through
[1:31:23] if
[1:31:24] if he's an ordained pastor if he's not
[1:31:25] he ain't gonna carry you nowhere
[1:31:32] with the fivefold ministry is jesus
[1:31:35] christ
[1:31:39] now i'm going to end it with the best
[1:31:40] way that i can say it
[1:31:44] honor the minister minister
[1:31:48] when they're preaching
[1:31:54] honor the ministers when they're
[1:31:56] preaching because you're honoring god
[1:32:01] pray for your ministers not just a
[1:32:04] pastor
[1:32:05] pray for the ministers of this church
[1:32:08] but pray for the offices and the things
[1:32:13] pray that god will lead us all
[1:32:17] and that way there won't be no big eye
[1:32:18] little you
[1:32:25] i counted an honor to be able to be
[1:32:28] associated with the
[1:32:30] end time message
[1:32:34] but there's a lot goes with that that we
[1:32:35] would not honor totally
[1:32:39] but that's not the message something
[1:32:42] that the holy ghost won't honor is not
[1:32:44] the message i don't care who brings it
[1:32:45] to me you or who it is
[1:32:49] it's not but just one message
[1:32:53] there's one messenger the lord jesus
[1:32:54] christ
[1:32:57] we're just the offices he uses to
[1:33:00] minister through
[1:33:03] but you know we are talking to his wife
[1:33:07] but now when i sat down sitting and
[1:33:09] ministered up free
[1:33:11] i become feminist in the body of christ
[1:33:15] because i am not a pastor sitting there
[1:33:22] ever who's bringing the word is the
[1:33:23] pastor
[1:33:28] you honor it that way and you'll see god
[1:33:29] will honor you
[1:33:35] come on musicians
[1:33:39] you can read but if people don't listen
[1:33:43] they're not going to pay no attention to
[1:33:44] you anyway
[1:33:47] offices it's while they're getting ready
[1:33:54] but there is five predestinated offices
[1:33:58] of the church we would see jesus 1962.
[1:34:04] but there is five predestinated offices
[1:34:07] now listen of the church apostles
[1:34:10] prophets teachers
[1:34:12] pastors and evangelists that's what god
[1:34:15] said
[1:34:16] in the church what the holy spirit
[1:34:20] that's the office
[1:34:24] this is the holy spirit okay
[1:34:28] nine different spiritual gifts
[1:34:33] all right in every local assembly nine
[1:34:38] different spiritual gifts then god has
[1:34:41] said
[1:34:42] his gifts that he has foreknown for
[1:34:45] each age and has placed them into the
[1:34:49] church
[1:34:52] we find that there's five of those gifts
[1:34:54] first
[1:34:55] missionary information all right first
[1:34:58] is apostles prophets teachers evangelist
[1:35:00] pastors
[1:35:01] those five god-given gifts
[1:35:05] is in the church so each of you people
[1:35:09] now listen so each of you people who
[1:35:12] have a godly pastor
[1:35:14] has a gift from god in your church
[1:35:17] a shepherd pastor means shepherd
[1:35:22] what greater honor could it be
[1:35:26] see there's those other gifts that comes
[1:35:28] into the church right
[1:35:30] and after the pastor
[1:35:33] now after the pastor
[1:35:37] then there's evangelistics come in
[1:35:40] then there's teachers come in and then
[1:35:42] there's prophets come in
[1:35:45] and then there's apostles come in all
[1:35:48] these together working together with the
[1:35:50] gifts
[1:35:52] keep the church re perfected and clean
[1:35:56] and ready for the coming of the lord
[1:36:00] see if you'd like to read these i'll be
[1:36:03] glad to give them to you they're all in
[1:36:05] my
[1:36:05] desk thing in there anyway you want them
[1:36:08] to just see a gift
[1:36:12] i count the baptism in the holy ghost to
[1:36:14] be the most important gift
[1:36:16] that could ever be received by any
[1:36:17] individual
[1:36:19] the new birth i hold out i believe that
[1:36:24] i believe as long as we'll let that
[1:36:26] operate
[1:36:29] here we're not promised to everything to
[1:36:31] go away and not be
[1:36:32] you know and not have troubles we're
[1:36:35] going to have that
[1:36:37] all right but church listen while we're
[1:36:40] in the
[1:36:41] i don't know what we're in right now i
[1:36:43] don't know because it's not to me maybe
[1:36:44] to understand
[1:36:45] but there's a kind of like a lull
[1:36:48] in the religious realms things now that
[1:36:52] people are just things are not uh
[1:36:55] beating and banging like they do
[1:36:56] sometimes
[1:36:59] but see one of these days they're gonna
[1:37:01] come after us
[1:37:03] it may be five years ten years maybe 50
[1:37:06] years who's worried i ain't care
[1:37:07] i won't be here but you just remember
[1:37:10] that i told you
[1:37:12] the one thing that i've always wanted a
[1:37:14] church to be is ready
[1:37:18] just be ready for everything to take
[1:37:22] place
[1:37:23] standing in order i remember in the
[1:37:26] baptist church there they used to preach
[1:37:27] that about the armor
[1:37:29] you remember you know the story and what
[1:37:30] it is in corinthians in other words
[1:37:31] you've got the armor of god you put it
[1:37:33] on
[1:37:33] i heard that preaching many times i got
[1:37:34] where i didn't want to read it
[1:37:36] because all i could do was rest play for
[1:37:38] this and this for that and i earned for
[1:37:40] a reason
[1:37:40] i didn't see a thing in the world that
[1:37:42] it was talking about
[1:37:44] to help me in the body of christ but
[1:37:46] then like i said one day i read a little
[1:37:48] further
[1:37:50] and i begin to see the baptism of the
[1:37:54] holy ghost
[1:37:55] is that shining armor that you're
[1:37:58] clothed in
[1:38:01] let's stand go ahead what we got
