========================================

call them out not too long ago I was reading or we were listening up here we said it's old sister get it now where it's gonna pass you by and they need about two minutes later he says was hard to go from him you didn't give it but what happened was she didn't have focused faith and he didn't he couldn't supersede her and belief you know what even got ten super senior right he came that is correct that takes your torch away right now but now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not saying why because if you see it you don't have that bad I just want it with these stables opening up why pop said when he still doesn't think truly open up in the degree they're supposed to open up we don't have to go back and go back to the first seat and leave it all over again I have paid to this open I think that we understand what's going on same way with Dan 170 week I know one I was thinking about this yesterday I guess I'll say it online there right there all this junk that's going on around the message I want to tell you something Paul said it and brother around him what a man and if he was there he said if an angel from heaven if I or an angel from heaven were to come and bring you something different than what I've already pre 20-sided let it be a curtain right they'd be accursed and he said it again he said in other words if you didn't hear me the first time let me state it again so what I'm telling you is even if brother Branham came back right now and went to Jefferson bill and said all that going on up there was okay let it be a curse that's what the Bible said let it be a curse because it's not scriptural right it's not scriptural we must go back to Scripture I mean how can we understand each sighs I mean deals tell talk about the other day I'd like to ask somebody this one question I'd like that sit down with somebody that thinks that we just need to press play and tell them to explain to me Daniel seventy weeks by these two quotes that I have when brother brown said that there's one week left after the rapture and that they're going reenact years left explain that without pressing play come if you press play you're going to get both what then you're going to give an opinion maybe no if you just press play you got this quote this quote how about let's stand and address the third person of the Trinity how about all these different things that the Holy Ghost is a lot horse rider he preached them it's on tape right how are you going to understand the Ethiopian eunuch is the best to me that's the greatest scripture to take to anybody he was reading the Bible he impressed play and he said how can I understand I'll let some man teach me so God sent Philip a man with the Holy Ghost to explain because he was reading the Bible and thought what is this Jesus or this day the courage is not Jesus was it David speaking of itself or somebody else why he was taking too close you can't do that you've got to have a fivefold ministry to break this thing down to the people because it just makes confusion but and I'm telling you damned 70 weeks is the most confusing doctrine in this message right that's where most people when they get off the the message rail car are the message crane the first thing they say is Brown didn't know what he's talking about when he said this over here he said this over there I mean calling people when when a group of people goes up north next is we believe in polygamy because brother Brown preached it you saw that we saw the video brother Trevor we saw the video they can friending with it right you know what they were reading and reading prayers Almanack right they were quoting Charles Stanley right they were quoting brother Ram what about this brother Brown said one quote that polygamy should be legal yeah but they don't read the rest of the quarters right we said let's not but they took that to them because it was a press play blow and there wasn't a preacher there that can help them with that's the thing so my heaven quote that's where that big city come break it down with me that's right and you know what it's like I said about about anything else we must realize this is supposed to happen this is supposed to happen but where's your faith my faith is that brother Graham brought the message button that's dumb because I believe that I don't have to have faith to run around with the Prophet I know he was there's no one menu at this event there's no one besides Jesus Christ ever walked on this earth that was as close to God in program right no one all the great man it doesn't matter who you want Medina all the great men brother Adam was right there that's why they call him Jesus Christ but I promise you somebody with a new burger will not call him God right don't God said I will not share my glory will no one no one so if you elevate him to Jesus Christ you're in trouble don't you do you make him an antichrist when you put something inserting something that's why said many weeks ago we can't insert brother Randall between us and Dinah there's only one mediator the man Christ Jesus and I said and we didn't become a son of God no son William Brown become something LEDs art did not go into the tent with Rebecca and I but he introduced Rebecca Kozik and then he went off the sink you don't care of him anymore hardly because he did his job he introduced the bride to Christ and to me that's the most simple see it's so simple people try to figure all this stuff out but see I don't have to have faith to program I already know that no any quote you hear me say these same like somebody said it I said the Seventh Seal one nothing I never said it I said if you don't believe it's open it's not if you don't believe it then it's not you caused it but if you believe in stainless steel oven but you gotta believe it's opened in that threefold manner home gobble any poor in Christ Christ in the church take her back to the Garden of Eden body Tang it's taking us back into another dimension and that's what work that we're facing now if you have Christ in your soul you don't have to go look for Christ that's what I said about that scripture Matthew 24 the reason I know I don't have to go somewhere else it's because Christ is here I don't have to go find him if you have to go find him you don't have it if you have to go looking for Christ because it's Christ in you the hope of glory that's just to me it just once it's broken down that's the most simple thing but but man's made it so complicated I do agree there is a bald spot full-member know that no doubt the devil has his own 500 men and they're at work okay but he does have a true five whole minutes because it says here I have faith that it's going to perfect the Saints which that attorney we have to go through they're barely healthy that research 58 59 [Applause] if that'll turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing that pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a delight the holy of the Lord are bullets you honor him not doing that own ways nor finding that home pleasure nor speaking that own words then shot them to life thou shall delight myself in the Lord and I will promise lead ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with a heritage subject up that father for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it that's good well even back during the law will go there I need this thing be even under the law remember that guy was picking up sticks on the Sabbath day I mean under the law he was killed what he wasn't doing what I'm told him to do he went in the tabernacle doing what God told them no me without doing whatever whatever so I mean it's just coming down folks I'm telling you there's gonna come a time I don't want to ever say these words I wish I would've I don't ever come to a time but I have to sit down by myself and say I wish I wouldn't write think about that everywhere you go think about I wish I would have done I wish out let's get the past I wish I wouldn't we need to have faith now if a brother grant preached on that they'll remember a couple years ago now face we got have now saying we don't need to have we can't have call space called already gone he's done he God we have faith in what Paul said cuz we know it was the Word of God same way we run around we know it was the Word of God but he's gone home it is left up to the fivefold ministry to bring this thing to a head like it or not that's God's program that's it and I'm not gonna mess with it [Music] you praise me go rob yeah we got your in [Music] that's right then remember us we're gonna be gone next Sunday to Arizona so we're late Friday won't be back - that's right yeah that's right they got brother royal coming in so they got the Baltimore in that's okay that's the Rachel Rachel Willis you can talk can you eat no you're not no man we were hoping for an adorable Rachel that would be not ever be normal what did they do y'all need to make enough See Mom and I said you're telling me that first son has got to have an appointment to come see his mother feasible if you don't want anybody else here and so please just pray for that it's going to get down the end of life there's always something fuzzy can Holloway somebody just call it fuzzy it's just it always okay then I'll become fuzzy you know be clear now become a little bit fuzzy yeah well you know how that is stuff going through it now all right let's go we were we kind of went down the past this but let's back up and read this and then we'll start with Hebrews 11 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works and that's Paul speaking cooks here now not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the Day approaching but then the reason that that we read this and we keep quoting it is because you see there I'm just going to make it plain as I can make it okay I don't want to make a distant plain as I can make it if you're not going to church now more than you are if you have no more desire now than you did two years ago you're lost you just don't have the baptism and all of that you did not I just read the Bible if you have no more desire I don't you know you say well I got this no that didn't ask for a laundry list it says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some it cuz you know what you get week right you get week you won't if you're looking at me and saying you don't get leaked you're lying cuz you're lying to this you get weaker because we are sheep sheep are herd animals right and they have to be herded by a shepherd then you Shepherd is not one that stays at the house the Shepherd is always with me chief but now what if the Sheep don't show up the wolves even because being a herd animal you stay in a herd it's self protection exactly they expect that's what we're doing with self protecting each other but this says not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is you can sit here and preach it and reach in preaching next study some of y'all said in this room will be in I'm not talking about you going somewhere I meant dog huh well we're gonna be here but we got a job to do nothing we're gonna set Holloman said well I don't wait I'll just watch it today because a big toe hurts or my cat staggered and so much more as you see the Day approaching that's the blindness member of the rest doctor we're talking yesterday about it no Friday he so desires to be in the church but there's none within miles of him to preach the truth miles I'm done 101 I'm talking like three hours away that really preached the treatment message so he has to watch but he didn't watch it's like these days and I you know I don't watch him my slipper I got copied so I really try to make it an atmosphere all the church service but now we have no excuse you can have one but this one doesn't does look for if we sin willfully after we've received the knowledge of the fifth so see you're aware you've been aware we've all been aware we've all been aware of this scripture right here it was written in of the year 80 60 something 50 something yeah okay 2000 years ago this scripture was written and we've been reading over left Sherman believe that's really what helped me you know I'll do all the things that I want to ensure for his being able to talk again when I [Music] see that's why it is instilled in all of us there was no even when we were in a bad with church being eight nine years old I can remember you didn't schedule nothing on something if you did if somebody else schedule something they went in you did like I said by Jenny's dad he used to show up on Saturday night sometime of course we can't go to church at the time look for fine but now you don't show up on Saturday night if he does he knows he's going to set there Sunday by itself or he can go it there's no question he said I know y'all go to church they know Wayne tonight he'll come very close sometimes here so yeah but it's what you show what but what if you would it but listen some of you do it you're sitting here some of you do it you kids come in from out of town laughter now I say lay out that means lay out could you lay it out that's right here did you scripture because what you're doing is you're telling the kids they're more important minister they're more important than you going to church that never will happen in my life never will happen in my life that my kids or my family will take over what this church takes over no listen you said what if somebody dies come on people I'm done by just a regular visit from your team it's your babies well you're lost you don't have enough Holy Ghost to get you to church because the Holy Ghost will come to church now brother Brown I'm saying you can't wait through the doors see we forget those scriptures and we go well we can do that no we can get those goods but right here's the 1i it doesn't I probably didn't have to come to tell and even like I said before we may go to the extreme but even that's going to Illinois and I found it's the church in between that we can go to church we're not gonna knock the dirt we're going to turn somewhere even at our vacations we found message churches and found places that we can Church even more on vacation now to me that may be a little bit extreme if you have the vacation schedule you're out in Colorado on Sunday then you don't have excuse I just said Colorado man customs department and reminds you I excuse me turbo even though it believes whatever it believed that very subtle jerk but you still you see what I'm saying because we are sheep right I would weaken myself if I didn't think I needed to go to Turkey you don't think you need to go to church then you are lost you are just this same and I don't want that I want in this section because look if we sin willfully this is the whole statement if we sin willfully after I stood up here and told you this this morning you know what they say after you've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for a judgment for of judgment and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries sheep have to be fed they do have a shepherd and we have to assemble ourselves together good but look but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses in other words the law was weak and even though the law was weak Moses is law said assemble yourself together that's right Israel knew when the church doors were open they needed to go alright that's what I'm telling you you you just you just don't have the Holy Ghost if you don't want to go to track you just don't have that I'm sorry you maybe you're justified sanctified foolish version but if you don't really in your heart feel you got to go to church you can come over though right you may fool yourself all these years but you know gonna flow God because of that stricter right there because listen that revelation was to me not long ago as you see the Day approaching the problem is that's the revelation to me cuz I see the Day approaching people they don't go to church they don't see the Day approaching thanks I was just like just brother labo day look they're talking you know they just they hammer on this come to church now you know what you're lost you're lost you have to do something about it yeah till I brother their original salvation let's just don't get saved it'll be funny cuz I say people don't go to turf save people go journey that's running okay I'm just you know what you can like say you can put your laundry list of mind you can't get here it just ain't gonna work with God because you know what I'm fearful and it's like I told you Sundy you're my family more than my family outside now I have a better opportunity something you could my family love them here I don't talk about my outside family they're not worth me staying out of church to see them because they're not spirit-filled people right they're not somebody I want to commune with what gets me is like what mom said you know you you retired people they're off all week they ain't got a thing to do except sit at home then I'll show you they gonna go visit somebody come on good gonna wait that's why your priorities are not right that's right come on tell me if I was retired Monday to Friday we wanna go see games that we go we go Tuesday we were not going away anything we would not go inside me I can't believe people did that but today exactly you know why you're on here because the holy ghost wants to hear right when you don't come here we want to hear you don't have the Holy Ghost oh there's nothing to respond to I'm telling you it's narrowing down it's narrowing down and the narrowing down is whether remember you come to that place brother Brown says got to tell you one more time then you won't take any more and that raised your age you're gonna follow up one side and just keep them one on this direction or are you gonna stay on that rage of the day right yes [Music] we're being fed buckets full here so I just thank God for that Bob needs to be careful with it hoarders liens d-nice you're what you said you said I made it for the same sale I've been made it so planned we'll just live and you can understand it you - I'm glad you're all right but it is plain Ryan sent me a big email I'm going to give him a pickle atta boy sent me a long email about how the Seventh Seal he did not think he could attain to it because it's been so great and so big it's so huge and so external we're now all I'm teaching is is it's already inside of you and that's what the whole thing is it's you Christ in you though Michael exactly it's a cyclic that we went out and we've got we've got all these great revelations but what he's gonna do is gonna come right back to where brother Brown when he stood on that Seventh Seal it was Christ he can preach anything else he just told about his journey in about his wail that Lord led him to different lanes and and he talked about his salvation we'll see that to me that's the seventh sale so see what I'm saying is those who have the seventh seal opens of them I don't have to sit here pound on hair and grass and come into church something's not open if it's open to a group of people and it's not open to another group of people then people ain't got what this group's got right okay so I made this one of maintenance I'm sorry to be this plane but I've been I've been thinking about it all week about all the things that even gone here and it happened to their church they slide brother clock said this is he's got a lot of wisdom bruh clock said anybody come to church Sunday morning he said but the real believers come back Sunday afternoon and the real real believers come a wink tonight yeah it kind of leads all the others out and that it does I mean you like said you can use whatever excuse you want to but that's exactly true because anybody can come to church home anymore that's really easy well for something but Sunday afternoon it gets a little bit harder to come basically here but that's your faithful and then Wednesday night is your real faithful because there's only a smaller group and if you don't come a win tonight thank you I'm talking to you sorry I'm just telling you what the Bible said than what God put in my heart to say so if you think it's the devil then I'd be careful but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the devour of the adversary he just stopped despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses let me tell you something else Lorne kind of put on my heart and say I say it now there is going to be a time when we can't get in together but it's not matter your cars cost as much of your first passing if you buy a new car your car is going to cost as much as your perfect house with me and you and got married our house is $30,000 you buy a new car now story job dollars for a basic four wheels in their condition so we're not in it we're not work yeah well we can't go back to looking we're back to my laces anyway I just that's okay but what happened is that what I'm saying is is you say well what will that squeeze company they ain't here yet I'm gonna pack it in just as much as I can pack it in every Wednesday every Sunday every time we have a church service I'm gonna pack it in because one day we might not be able come together as a group we might have to meet out in the woods or anybody it ain't happening man I think somebody's been a little some people are a little premature they starting now but there will come a time so you said well what about that script or the last scriptures don't go away but you know what even if it's you and your wife right and you can't get to church you two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in the minute that's not you and your wife said hello we have a church near that's not that's not Bible and that's not good rounds missing okay so you said well you know you can use the excuse you want it it's like I said you got all this time to do this other stuff and you don't have time come Church couple back yeah but you go take vacations and trips knowledge but you don't mind come turn please people good grief that's faith you know what it is you don't have enough faith if you get scared off take care of me I know it you know y'all gonna go upstairs and he gonna feel a little look a little raw but other than that maybe jewel love bring something into just put some jewelry I'm gonna be real surprised if he don't mention something about this in the service because it's been so pressing only this week we got to get on this channel how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be that word they thought worthy who hath trodden under foot something you know what isn't saying he that despised Moses law this was lawful do's and dont's died without mercy under two or three witnesses in other words what's he's saying how much more this man will come and die for you on a cross and it's like June always says about witnessing to people they say well what this long-haired thing Jim said look if God can come down in human flesh hanging on the cross driving nails through his hand pierced his side naked on a cross died for me me wearing long hair is nothing it's mine trying to give back trying to give back in a feeble way but trying to give back something to this man that came and I'm forced to do and have counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing that's what I said call this really he did exactly but I'm kidding if you don't assemble yourself together you have no words you have drugged Moses as long throwed it out but you've also why do you think brother Adam let's think about this over there why do you think brother Brennan had preached indictment what did he indict he indicted this generation for putting Christ back on the cross for the sake of crucifixion of Christ but you know why he had to be he had to be so that Matthew 17 can come fast at the Son of man be risen again where's he risen again in us that's why we don't do what they do out there that's why we don't know shouldn't have anyway so how much more so replenishment how much more store replacement should we be punished if we count this new covenant wherein he died for an unholy thing okay that's just burning my bridges right here well not your sister but you counted on a holy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace for we know him that has said vengeance belongeth unto me that's done I will recompense saith the Lord and again the Lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God like I said before I've been reading through kings and I'm into Jobe now man read book of Job jobs a stroke right jobs our struggle even those three guys that come to him they just weren't his friends that came that poor they were going jobs like but then you see that last one coming you see the last one which tops Christ you see that last one come and he brings everything aligned it right back up right and even Joe even job had to go just one day he just didn't take I'm just I'm just I'm just a fool I should have never been born you know but then he comes back and says but God in other words who is rich in mercy has brought me to this place and brought me and sent me and what did what did what did God do for Joe at the very end you see what happens if you do just a little bit of due diligence to what God said Joe gave God gave Joe back all of this family doubled everything you have even this family come she got seven in heaven and he got seven more kids he had ten thousand kavithai giving 20,000 Kevin I mean he was twice is better off but you have it but remember he had settled at that sheep brother walk and come harder and scrape the boiled off of his body now that was me and that mean you going through our trials and tribulation so look what the job is if you'll just analyze it and just remember that that the three guys that was talking to him it's kind of devilish they're you know they're saying told you did something wrong you know secretly you jump like no and then Joe finally he puts the state that I know my Redeemer liveth he saw revelation something happens where he knew there was a man that was going to come in human flesh and then was going to take everything and redeem him back now if you can see that and a job is the oldest book of the Bible so he didn't Abraham went in here yet Moses wasn't here yet he was written right after the flood so there what many people on the earth but Joel was the real good guy you know and he did sacrifices and he tried to do his best he had to come from the lineage of one of the hams hammered a path we know probably went ham the levels of evil part challenge a path so he come from good stock but remember one thing's for sure God took Satan's attention and put it onto Satan didn't just go looking for Joker same way with me and you if we're going through a trauma tribulation God man said Satan you you considered my servant he said servant go have you considered my servant but remember job all the way through that at the very end he never denied his faith right don't want to destroy this body in my flesh I shall see God he was point in several thousand years to the resurrection and so that's what we got to look forward to but just the book of Job I had written a long time so but remember back in kings and sang on all that if the people would do God do good God would bless them the people would do matters I wouldn't listen right okay the caller in much the former days in which after you were illuminated your endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst you were made of gazing stopped both by reproaches an affliction my job and us partly whilst you became companions of them that were so used for you have compassion of being my bondage Don about his problems now to come about Paul being in prison itself and to enjoy Philebus pausing every good knowing in yourself that you have in heaven a better and enduring substance same way here I mean we we do the best we can with what we got but my heavens would you want to own this place right now at the moment that we're talking about would you want to own the earth no you would not and we can't clean it off by our individual self but we have to depend on God through us and then he's going to get us out of here and then he's gonna lock the whole thing and then bring us right back into here what a great God cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward cast not away your confidence Bob of talking about confidence and determination and all that's why if you've got confidence in door then to me that just that just let's think about Wednesday night it just takes your faith and it just explodes it because I have confidence not just that I've got to come to church every single young stance you say you got yourself dragon caroling tonight dreams been here in 20 years you grab yourself instead now and go a lot sure Lucy I said that son because I sure don't want to be here don't come that means you're lost that thinks you don't have to all go but if you'll come in and go god this is gonna help me every time which has a great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God everybody's won't doctor come on the scene and give us promises and give us this and give us that give us the other after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in it he's quoting the Old Testament all right but if they may draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition our sin or hell but of them that believe to the saving of the soul all right now now faith is the substance of things are you see what I mean about the letter that Paul wrote it's just a continuous writing till you go back to 11 of 1000 always at the bottom but we are not of them which draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now faith is the substance of things hoped for because remember you're not hoping to be a church today you don't have a faith that you're coming to Sunday school you had faith in your journey that you were getting to Sunday's Google once you get here it's no more faith right that's why the Bible will continue to read them because look once you come to something you don't have to have faith in that anymore if I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in my soul I don't have to have faith in God some same exact so if faith is kind of like faith to me is like repentance Lord forgive me what I'm going to do tomorrow no that's not what repentance a repentance is what you do it so faith is the same way faith is looking back to what the journey is and it brings you up here now you think them go away but what what we're going to read in just a little while it says from faith to faith that's what Paul is going to tell us them a little while leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ a laying on of hands and a water baptism and of all they plant I don't need to be baptized again I have faith that the baptism and I have took care of that so I don't have to say well I wondered now if you wonder you need to go back get settled that my brother Gramps didn't take that state and drop it down say Satan right here this is where I was baptizing them Lord Jesus Christ I went through everything you told me to go through done now I'm gonna have faithful but I see don't go back next week do the same thing you've lost something or you never gain something that's what it was what I'm saying about the same thing with faith for being healed paid for being healed comes inside of you this is what brother Branham tells people over and over and over again he tells them it's your faith that operates together right not him it's your faith they're not racing you brother around couldn't heal nobody they had to have faith even brother man
