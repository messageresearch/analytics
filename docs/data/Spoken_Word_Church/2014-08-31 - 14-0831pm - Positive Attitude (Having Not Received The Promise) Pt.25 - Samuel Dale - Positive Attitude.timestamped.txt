[15:45] Moses was he said Lord I've heard of you
[15:48] talk to you I'd like to see you said you
[15:51] know what he made a way
[15:53] so he can make a way for us right amen
[15:55] good to see everybody in the house of
[15:57] the Lord remember now this coming
[15:59] Saturday will be Bible study remember
[16:01] Wednesday night will be brother Bob
[16:03] preaching for us you'll remember these
[16:06] announcements and this morning they were
[16:09] giving my wife uh the nurse was Dire and
[16:13] the therapy people were there and they
[16:16] really put her through today and they
[16:17] said it really done a marvelous job you
[16:20] know she was doing good you know but she
[16:23] didn't see us way it get the wave at her
[16:25] this morning and so everybody's got to
[16:27] wave again and let you know so wave at
[16:30] the piggy you know to Sister Dale if
[16:32] she's uh watching you know because we
[16:36] we miss her
[16:37] and uh I was in a hurry to get home but
[16:41] there's a little more to the story that
[16:44] I hope about
[16:46] uh
[16:48] Terence was talking about you know you
[16:50] have to watch him because sometimes he
[16:52] gives you what he wants you to hear
[16:55] and you got to put the rest of it
[16:56] together
[16:57] and we was doing 110 mile an hour going
[17:00] down the road
[17:01] but when we stopped to go out in the
[17:03] highway we were still running 50. so now
[17:06] if you can figure that out you'll be
[17:08] doing all right
[17:10] if you're sitting dead still running 50
[17:12] mile an hour you can figure there's
[17:14] something wrong with the speedometer but
[17:17] you know that's that's good amen but
[17:21] good to be in the house of the Lord we
[17:22] love him and I pray that as we try to
[17:25] bring this today if we don't get through
[17:27] it'll be all right
[17:29] but I'm trying to get a point across now
[17:31] the point won't stop we will just move
[17:34] on into more scriptures and things and
[17:37] won't be relating to just the thoughts
[17:40] that we've been bringing but we'll still
[17:43] beyond the positive attitude because
[17:45] that's one that's the one thing I want
[17:47] us to have
[17:48] is a very positive attitude and I want
[17:51] you to listen today
[17:53] because I've I've had
[17:55] you know almost three weeks now to
[17:58] meditate upon trying to express what I
[18:03] believe I see
[18:06] and I remember promote said I said
[18:09] brother mode they're not getting it he
[18:10] said no wonder he said you spent 40
[18:12] hours studying and preaching an hour and
[18:15] a half and think they can believe it can
[18:17] get it all said you know you have to
[18:19] kind of slow down so we'll we'll do that
[18:21] and then we'll have some review maybe
[18:23] next Sunday and maybe questions and
[18:26] answers about what we've been talking
[18:28] about so that way you can uh can can you
[18:32] know do those things but let's turn to
[18:34] Hebrews 11.
[18:35] and we'll go from 11 1 through 2 and
[18:38] then 11 chapter 11 11-13 to pick up her
[18:43] thought okay
[18:45] Heavenly Father we thank you
[18:47] for your love and your grace your
[18:49] kindness your all in all
[18:52] and thank you for being you
[18:54] thank you for opening our eyes that we
[18:58] may see you
[19:00] that we may know you
[19:02] in true life and understanding
[19:04] It's Your Love Lord could be made
[19:06] manifest in each one of our hearts and
[19:08] our lives
[19:09] because that's the desire we have
[19:11] we desire to see you living among us
[19:15] and to do what you want to do
[19:17] so we commit the whole service to you
[19:19] Lord we just ask you to do as you said
[19:22] you would
[19:23] you said you sent your word and healed
[19:25] us
[19:26] and delivered us from destruction so
[19:28] come Among Us this afternoon and speak
[19:31] to our hearts and our lives and heal
[19:33] these physical bodies that bother so
[19:36] much we love you and we thank you in
[19:40] Jesus name amen
[19:43] Hebrews 11 1-2 then 11 through verse 13.
[19:49] now Faith is the substance of things
[19:51] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[19:53] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[19:57] good report now notice
[20:00] keep that in your mind they obtained
[20:04] a good report
[20:07] now when we read on over
[20:10] it's going to sound contrary
[20:14] to what this is saying but just remember
[20:17] we spent uh I don't know how many
[20:20] services now on a relationship of this
[20:23] to try to see that they did
[20:27] you know have a good report they did
[20:30] attain unto what was promised them
[20:33] all right
[20:35] but now we take in the Bible same Bible
[20:37] it's either explaining that let's go to
[20:40] verse 11.
[20:43] it says through faith also Sarah
[20:45] receives strength to conceive seed
[20:49] and was delivered of a child when she
[20:51] was past age because she judged him
[20:53] faithful who had promised
[20:56] now remember she had the promise right
[20:59] she received the promise right therefore
[21:02] spraying there even of one
[21:05] and him as good as dead
[21:07] so many as the stars of the sky in
[21:10] multitude and is the sand which is by
[21:13] the seashore innumerable
[21:15] now watch
[21:18] these all died in faith
[21:22] having not received
[21:25] the promises
[21:29] yeah
[21:31] but having seen them afar off
[21:34] and we're persuaded of them and embraced
[21:37] them and confess that they were
[21:39] strangers in pilgrims
[21:42] on the earth amen you may be seated the
[21:44] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[21:46] the word
[21:48] now
[21:49] to start off saying
[21:51] reading
[21:54] that they obtained a good report
[21:58] and to know that they did achieve
[22:02] what God had promised to them
[22:05] in their day in their time
[22:09] but then to read
[22:12] and it says
[22:15] they all died in faith
[22:18] not having received the promises
[22:23] now
[22:25] what about that
[22:30] what were the promises
[22:32] they didn't receive
[22:36] all right
[22:37] so now remember that
[22:39] keep that in mind verse 16.
[22:43] I want to keep emphasizing that
[22:46] you know to where you'll think about it
[22:50] and I want you to look at the scripture
[22:53] so go ahead brothers and pull back up
[22:56] Hebrews 11 13.
[23:01] all right
[23:04] these all died in faith
[23:10] every one of them
[23:12] accomplished
[23:14] what God had told them
[23:20] right
[23:25] foreign
[23:25] there wasn't a one in there that was
[23:28] cold there's never been anybody told of
[23:31] God that they would bring forth
[23:33] something in them not bring it forth I
[23:35] was thinking the other day about what
[23:37] brother Branham said
[23:39] relating it I think with Brother Gary
[23:41] that brother Branham said
[23:45] he said if you're dying
[23:48] he says ever doctor in the world
[23:52] could be there
[23:55] and it would not stop it
[23:57] you would die
[24:00] but he said if you're there
[24:04] he said an Ever devil in hell
[24:08] was there to try to kill you
[24:11] he says they can't kill you
[24:15] until God is true with you
[24:19] all right
[24:21] there's never been anybody in the Bible
[24:24] that was a failure
[24:27] you remember that years ago I asked a
[24:29] challenge to point to you show me the
[24:32] worst person in the Bible that you think
[24:33] would be a failure
[24:37] and people were giving different ones
[24:39] and and I said well finally the one that
[24:41] I would think of was was um
[24:45] saw
[24:46] in that he went down to the witch of
[24:48] Endor he done all of these things and it
[24:51] looks bad
[24:53] but even by going to the witch of Endor
[24:56] and it finishing all up
[24:59] he ended up by God telling him
[25:03] you're going to be with me
[25:06] tomorrow
[25:09] there's never been a believer in the
[25:11] Bible
[25:13] that is a failure
[25:16] everybody has always accomplished
[25:19] what was set for them to do
[25:23] even if they tried to hinder it you know
[25:29] I mean we don't think about that do we
[25:31] we don't think about all through our
[25:32] life how we try to do the things we
[25:34] wanted to do and God wouldn't let us do
[25:37] it
[25:38] you know we don't consider that
[25:40] huh
[25:43] but notice now
[25:46] why would the Apostle Paul
[25:50] the great teacher just leave that up for
[25:52] a second will you
[25:53] the great teacher that he was
[25:56] spends so much time
[25:59] expressing that these all
[26:03] received the promise
[26:06] that was promised to them
[26:09] all right Abraham and Sarah child
[26:12] you know
[26:14] uh
[26:15] what could you go through
[26:19] David and God bringing forth a child
[26:22] even out of that situation
[26:27] the promises
[26:29] to the people
[26:31] and remember now this is verse 16.
[26:35] well verse 13 which is right in the
[26:38] middle
[26:41] then all at once he reverts right back
[26:45] seemingly saying
[26:48] they give a good report
[26:52] he brings out some of them
[26:55] then he says
[26:57] having not received the promises
[27:02] then he goes right back to the great
[27:04] warriors of faith and that was why I
[27:07] read that this morning
[27:08] from 17 through
[27:11] going on to the end of it
[27:16] but look what it says about him
[27:19] these all died in faith
[27:23] not having received the promises
[27:26] but having seen them afar off
[27:31] and we're persuaded of them
[27:35] and embrace them
[27:37] and confess that they were strangers and
[27:40] pilgrims on the Earth
[27:44] for they that say such things
[27:49] declare plainly
[27:53] that they seek a country
[27:56] and truly
[27:58] if they'd have been mindful of that
[27:59] country from which they came out
[28:04] they might have had opportunity to have
[28:06] stayed
[28:07] I'll just put a little point there to me
[28:09] when I read that I think about
[28:11] you know they were always wanting to go
[28:13] back to the garlics and the cucumbers
[28:15] you know
[28:18] but look
[28:20] but now they desire a better country
[28:27] that is
[28:30] a heavenly
[28:34] right
[28:35] they desire a better country
[28:38] it would be any place outside of living
[28:41] in the United States that I'd love to
[28:42] live would I'd love to live in Israel
[28:45] they can turn over a rock and plant a
[28:48] tree and it'll grow
[28:53] find water out in the middle of the
[28:55] desert
[28:58] go down to the to the Dead Sea and ride
[29:02] down through there
[29:03] and look out this way
[29:06] and it's just Barren desert
[29:09] you know nothing
[29:11] look over this way
[29:12] and it's just thousands of Acres of the
[29:17] most beautiful trees
[29:19] they said we can grow here in Israel
[29:21] anything that'll grow anywhere in the
[29:24] world
[29:26] salt literally salt
[29:31] from the Dead Sea laying around the
[29:34] trees
[29:37] some way they neutralized that
[29:40] see Danny knows about it waiting him
[29:43] does that Jacob got into a thing that
[29:46] there's a fertilizer now that they can
[29:48] it comes out of the ocean
[29:51] and it's really edible
[29:54] you know
[29:55] it'll make things grow
[29:58] see maybe they're learning back some of
[29:59] those things
[30:01] but look what it says but now they
[30:04] desire a country that is
[30:07] a heavenly
[30:09] word of God is not ashamed to be called
[30:11] their God
[30:15] for he hath prepared for them
[30:18] a city
[30:26] as I said they didn't receive the
[30:28] promise
[30:32] all right let's read go to number two
[30:40] and look what it says Hebrews 11 38 and
[30:43] 39 and 40.
[30:44] of whom the world was not worthy they
[30:47] wandered in deserts and mountains and in
[30:49] dens and caves of the Earth
[30:53] and these all having obtained a good
[30:57] report through faith
[31:02] and he says they did
[31:07] now these all having a good report true
[31:09] faith
[31:11] received not to promise
[31:15] Paul you got my mind
[31:17] blow it all out of shape
[31:22] you're saying they had a good report
[31:26] then you're saying that they never
[31:27] received the promises and then we read a
[31:30] whole bunch more as we read this morning
[31:31] you know of David and Jefferson and all
[31:35] of the ones through there and he comes
[31:37] right back to his same point
[31:41] and he says and these all having
[31:44] obtained a good report through faith
[31:48] receive not
[31:50] the promise
[31:55] verse 40 now God having provided some
[31:59] better thing for us
[32:02] that they
[32:04] without us
[32:06] should not be made perfect
[32:11] now
[32:13] if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[32:16] your mind right today is as muddled as
[32:19] can be about that because you can never
[32:21] comprehend it
[32:24] right
[32:26] even with the holy spirit it's hard to
[32:29] think about
[32:31] that you spend all of that time with the
[32:33] great warriors of faith that made a good
[32:36] report that everything that was promised
[32:39] to them God gave it to them
[32:46] and yet Paul says
[32:52] not having received the promises
[32:57] but seeing them afar off
[33:05] then he says
[33:07] and he's all having obtained a good
[33:09] report
[33:12] through faith
[33:15] received not
[33:18] the promise
[33:23] then he he hooks the key
[33:26] to the entire story into verse 40.
[33:32] because whatever they were not able now
[33:35] are you listening
[33:37] they received what was promised to them
[33:40] of the day that they were living are you
[33:44] with me
[33:45] every one of them
[33:48] we've spent all this time preaching
[33:50] about what they've done and the things
[33:52] and we could spend years preaching about
[33:54] all of the great warriors of faith
[33:57] and they achieved what God said they
[34:00] would receive
[34:02] to Abraham and Sarah child until David a
[34:05] child coming down and right out of there
[34:07] a Rahab to harlot and out of there
[34:10] coming down
[34:11] through into the lineages of David
[34:18] that who wasn't Jacob and and who was
[34:21] the woman
[34:22] Tamar
[34:23] maybe even out of an adulterous act that
[34:25] your Prophet said it was adultery
[34:30] come a child that out of there came a
[34:33] lineage
[34:35] that came down
[34:40] so now I want you to think with me
[34:44] what would Paul be saying
[34:51] they received what they were told
[34:55] that they would get
[34:59] why does he double-state it
[35:02] verse 13 and then what verse 39.
[35:08] why would he make that statement
[35:12] and say that they receive not the
[35:14] promise the other one says promises
[35:21] then he puts the answer
[35:24] to his whole
[35:26] layout
[35:29] into verse 40.
[35:33] and he says they
[35:35] without us
[35:38] cannot be made perfect
[35:43] now watch the Gentiles Got to Do with It
[35:47] because that's who he's talking about
[35:48] right right
[35:56] what have we got to do
[35:59] with the Perfection of Israel
[36:08] are you thinking
[36:14] let me put it this way because I know
[36:16] it's going to be a hard one I'll have to
[36:18] keep trying to explain in a few messages
[36:23] as I was saying this morning that
[36:26] without Sarah Abraham no matter how much
[36:30] Faith he had
[36:33] could not have brought the child Isaac
[36:37] into being
[36:39] he could have took a hundred wives
[36:43] had a hundred children
[36:47] and he still wouldn't have had
[36:49] the promise of God right
[36:52] he wouldn't have had Isaac
[36:56] right so was God waiting on Abraham to
[36:58] get the revelation
[37:00] in which he's really waiting on Sarah to
[37:02] get it
[37:04] you know
[37:06] all right what was the point in the
[37:08] message
[37:11] that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[37:15] he's a special group of people
[37:20] amen the end I brought down through
[37:22] seven Church ages
[37:25] and there was no leaven
[37:27] among the church ages
[37:30] yeah we can look at all of the wrong
[37:31] they've done
[37:33] but God does not see that
[37:36] but he does not see
[37:38] Abraham and all of the giving his wife
[37:41] away and the doubtings and the laughing
[37:44] and pleading with him to let Ishmael
[37:48] be the promise
[37:51] neither does he see anything in Sarah
[37:54] when he writes to Sarah he doesn't right
[37:57] of her wrongs
[38:04] will you go with me on that
[38:07] all right then how simple is it is it
[38:09] then
[38:10] to realize
[38:12] that he doesn't see our wrongs
[38:19] because he's not looking at our lives
[38:21] that we live
[38:25] he's looking at the atonement he made in
[38:27] our place
[38:30] because with Abraham he made and what
[38:35] unconditional Covenant
[38:41] is it Bible
[38:44] and I'd read my unconditional Covenant
[38:46] then the guy starts lying giving his
[38:49] wife away all kind of deceivings
[38:54] life in it God because of what he says
[38:56] is going to happen
[39:02] and God don't count that
[39:05] and he said he staggered not at the
[39:07] promise of God through unbelief but was
[39:10] strong in faith giving God to honor and
[39:14] glory to know that he take care of it
[39:19] see then I could really get down and
[39:20] preach some if I
[39:23] had a little time
[39:24] because you could preach about Abraham
[39:27] that maybe Abraham had a little better
[39:29] understanding than we think
[39:31] maybe Abraham thought maybe I can save
[39:34] my neck to keep that King from killing
[39:36] me
[39:37] because God said we're going to have
[39:39] that baby in lord it's up to you
[39:45] to keep that King from getting my wife
[39:48] see I could do some preaching but
[39:51] that's what a lot of people likes to
[39:53] hear
[39:54] but
[39:57] get back to the point
[40:01] these all obtained a good report
[40:05] to a personal experience
[40:08] with God for whatever it was for their
[40:11] day their time
[40:15] right
[40:18] but they received not to promise
[40:25] God having provided some better thing
[40:28] for us
[40:32] that they without us
[40:35] should not be made perfect
[40:39] so whatever Israel is to ever attain
[40:43] unto
[40:46] are you listening
[40:48] whatever Israel will ever attain unto
[40:53] and we have a Bible full of what they
[40:55] will
[40:58] be 144 000 saved now behold the Israel
[41:02] will be saved as a whole in the basis of
[41:06] the ones whose names were written there
[41:10] the Millennium is to the Jews
[41:13] all right
[41:17] well you know what they're not going to
[41:19] get that
[41:24] unless
[41:25] this group Paul calls us
[41:34] has something to do with it
[41:41] now what do we got to do with it
[41:50] what do we got to do
[41:52] with it
[41:55] it's good to think about the US and like
[41:57] brother dick likes it this way Paul's
[41:59] standing there saying us a few days
[42:01] later his head cuts off
[42:03] and he's in the grounds saying y'all get
[42:06] me out of here
[42:09] huh
[42:11] he went from us to them
[42:15] right
[42:17] but what do we have to do
[42:21] with Israel
[42:23] obtaining the promises and what are the
[42:27] promises
[42:32] and if we do not achieve it if you don't
[42:34] get nothing out of the message today I
[42:36] wish you'd write this thought down if we
[42:38] don't come to a place
[42:41] to bring forth the promises of God then
[42:44] there is no hope for anyone behind us
[42:50] because we'll get over in it when we
[42:52] finish this if we have time don't worry
[42:55] brother random uses
[42:57] a day without us cannot be made perfect
[42:58] in the Statue of a perfect man and says
[43:01] see down Through the Ages
[43:05] they're waiting on you and I
[43:09] let's don't even deal with down Through
[43:11] the Ages
[43:13] until we get an opportunity
[43:17] let's deal with Israel
[43:23] let's deal with the people that we've
[43:25] read of called Hebrews 11
[43:27] doesn't speak of the Gentiles
[43:30] he's speaking of Israel
[43:34] all right
[43:37] he said wait a minute well then let me
[43:39] say it this way and we'll get back to it
[43:41] in another message or two
[43:44] even those that have died like Paul
[43:48] Paul received the promises
[43:58] don't say that right down Through the
[44:00] Ages didn't receive the promises
[44:03] them through the church ages because
[44:05] they did
[44:08] let's deal with Israel alone
[44:11] well people on the internet follow that
[44:13] line or thought
[44:17] let's think about all of these in
[44:19] Hebrews 11.
[44:22] yet they
[44:24] achieved
[44:26] everything
[44:28] that God said they would do that's what
[44:31] Paul's explaining right
[44:34] he's explaining how all of these obtain
[44:37] that
[44:41] that they were told that they would do
[44:45] Abraham and savior a child David coming
[44:48] over this with that one all the promises
[44:50] they all received it
[44:55] Joshua walled falling down
[44:58] you know all the way through
[45:03] with they without us cannot be made
[45:05] perfect
[45:08] now brother Dale now what can we have to
[45:10] do with making Israel perfect that's
[45:12] what I'm asking you
[45:14] I'm glad you thought of that that's what
[45:17] I'm asking you
[45:24] so what does that word perfect mean
[45:27] Scofield references it back as to
[45:30] Matthew 5 48.
[45:34] where it says be therefore perfect even
[45:36] as your father in Heaven is perfect
[45:38] and Scofield at that incident
[45:42] says that sinless Perfection is not even
[45:45] the question
[45:49] he said it's completeness
[45:52] or a full age
[45:56] so the word perfect is not dealing with
[45:58] us bringing them out of the grave and
[46:02] doing something to them to make them
[46:04] perfect
[46:07] he wasn't listening a minute ago if
[46:09] you're thinking that away
[46:11] because Paul
[46:12] that became one of them
[46:16] had the promises
[46:21] that Israel needed
[46:26] now
[46:31] what does that word perfect mean then
[46:34] go ahead with 2A and let's pull it up
[46:36] and give the definition
[46:40] is it 50 48
[46:43] basic same definition as uh
[46:47] we're speaking of
[46:50] a day without us cannot be made perfect
[46:52] and if that doesn't mean anything to do
[46:55] with a sinless Perfection because we
[46:58] know we cannot give salvation to anyone
[47:03] Etc right all right look what the
[47:06] definition of it means to make perfect
[47:08] perfect
[47:11] to finish
[47:15] they without us cannot be finished
[47:21] to fulfill
[47:22] they without us cannot
[47:25] it cannot be fulfilled
[47:28] they can't be perfect look to make
[47:31] perfect complete
[47:33] to carry through completely
[47:37] to accomplish
[47:41] to finish
[47:43] to bring to an end
[47:46] they without us now
[47:48] cannot carry through completely they
[47:51] cannot accomplish what they were set out
[47:53] to do they cannot finish what was said
[47:56] for them they cannot bring to an end
[48:00] to complete perfect in the words add
[48:03] what is yet wanting in order to render a
[48:07] thing full
[48:09] to be found perfect
[48:13] to bring to the end our goal
[48:17] proposed
[48:21] they without us and not come to an end
[48:24] that's proposed for them
[48:26] to accomplish in other words bring to a
[48:29] close or fulfillment by event
[48:33] the Prophecies of the scriptures I love
[48:36] that
[48:40] Without You and I
[48:44] Israel cannot come to the promises that
[48:48] was made to them of the prophecies
[48:51] through the scriptures
[48:55] foreign
[48:59] you really have got me now honey
[49:08] but let's think about it a minute
[49:12] very few notes so
[49:16] let's think about it a minute
[49:20] What could
[49:22] you and I
[49:26] to do or whatever
[49:28] what we could do or not do or what would
[49:31] it be
[49:32] that could bring Israel to a state
[49:37] that the Prophecies of the scriptures
[49:39] said they would achieve
[49:46] very slow this afternoon I want you to
[49:49] think
[49:50] not sleep think
[49:58] I like to do that
[50:01] I like it like that man said that time
[50:03] he said
[50:04] I had asked a question and nobody in the
[50:07] building couldn't answer it and his
[50:08] brother got up he said I hate it when a
[50:10] man asked a question and he's the only
[50:12] one in the building that had the answer
[50:14] I said I wouldn't have asked it if I
[50:17] hadn't had the answer I would not have
[50:19] asked the question had I not had the
[50:21] answer to it
[50:28] oh brother Dan what does that make you a
[50:29] smart alec do what you want to that's
[50:32] all right with me
[50:33] I've asked you a question
[50:35] the pulpit is yours
[50:40] to explain it
[50:47] what is Israel
[50:49] waiting on
[50:57] and what is it dependent
[50:59] upon
[51:01] for them to even have the ability to
[51:03] wait
[51:10] oh okay
[51:14] let's go with it for a little bit or to
[51:16] keep your mind in the right Channel
[51:23] you know that it was promised to Israel
[51:29] to get eternal life
[51:37] all right we've all been real careful
[51:38] and we've been nice and we got it it's
[51:40] took me 40 years to plant the seed of it
[51:42] but it's all right
[51:45] to get you to the point of thinking that
[51:47] the Old Testament science did not have
[51:49] the new birth
[51:52] they didn't have eternal life in their
[51:53] soul if they did why did Jesus have to
[51:56] die
[51:58] that's what the Bible says said the Holy
[51:59] Ghost not given because Jesus has not
[52:01] been glorified
[52:03] all right
[52:05] so they did not have eternal life
[52:12] and the great Enoch walked off the Earth
[52:15] and went somewhere
[52:18] Elijah took a chariot ride
[52:21] and went somewhere
[52:28] but did not have eternal life in their
[52:30] soul while they were on Earth
[52:33] all right
[52:35] so now we've concluded that
[52:40] that they never attained unto certain
[52:43] promises
[52:47] we have a time we have concluded that
[52:50] they did get what God told them they
[52:53] would get for the time right
[52:57] right so Paul's right they made a good
[52:59] report
[53:05] but they never achieved or attained into
[53:07] the promise
[53:10] and it was promised unto him
[53:12] John John 1
[53:15] 11-12 we we want to read John 1 uh go
[53:19] ahead and pull that one up number three
[53:21] we like to read John we like to read one
[53:24] up to so far and then jump over to verse
[53:26] 14. but we don't look at a lot of the
[53:28] scriptures look what it says he came
[53:30] unto his own
[53:33] in his own received him not
[53:38] who's he talking about Jews Israelites
[53:40] right
[53:42] we know the difference in Jews and
[53:44] Israelites okay we've been through all
[53:46] that not all Israel's Israel
[53:48] I don't Jews are Jews
[53:51] but as many as received him to them gave
[53:55] he power to become the sons of God even
[53:59] to them that believe on his name
[54:03] so what was promised Israel that they
[54:06] never attained
[54:08] we're talking about a nation people a
[54:10] group of people
[54:14] they never attained eternal life
[54:20] even though it was promised unto him and
[54:23] many Jews
[54:25] Israelites
[54:27] I don't even want to call them
[54:29] did receive eternal life
[54:33] because they did receive the new birth
[54:37] because the book of Acts was basically
[54:39] Jews with a few Gentiles placed within
[54:42] it
[54:43] all right
[54:44] so now some of the people received it
[54:49] what was the promise to Israel that they
[54:52] never received
[54:54] eternal life right
[54:59] but not receiving eternal life
[55:06] look at
[55:07] number five go ahead brother last to
[55:10] number four excuse me I think that's
[55:13] where I'm at no number is 10.
[55:17] John 10 28 okay
[55:20] would you believe not because you're not
[55:22] of my sheep
[55:24] as I said unto you my sheep hear my
[55:27] voice and I know them and they follow me
[55:30] now Israel was ever one the Sheep of God
[55:37] what is Jesus speaking of
[55:43] right
[55:44] they were the chosen right
[55:51] and I give unto them eternal life and
[55:53] they shall never perish neither shall
[55:55] any man pluck them out of my hand there
[55:57] was a chosen of Israel
[56:01] that received eternal life
[56:04] on the day of Pentecost
[56:06] and through the book of Acts and through
[56:08] the times and until this day still Jews
[56:11] are being saved Paul said you think we
[56:13] couldn't be saved he said well here I am
[56:14] I got it and that's put in plain
[56:17] language
[56:20] yeah
[56:22] but he gave eternal life
[56:26] to all that would have accepted him
[56:30] the Jews first
[56:33] is it the Bible and then unto the
[56:35] Gentiles right
[56:36] the Jews received it because Upper Room
[56:38] experience with all 120 word Jews basics
[56:42] of the book of Acts was Jews a few
[56:45] gentiles
[56:48] so now that some of Israel did receive
[56:50] eternal life
[56:52] but what about the rest of Israel
[56:59] what about those that were blinded
[57:05] you know the ones that received eternal
[57:07] life
[57:08] we're not blinded
[57:11] and they were the means by where we
[57:13] received eternal life
[57:16] because the Jews brought the message of
[57:18] Salvation to the Gentiles
[57:22] right
[57:25] the prophet said the Gentiles must take
[57:28] the message back to Israel
[57:35] right
[57:38] okay
[57:44] Matthew number five
[57:48] and I say unto you that many shall come
[57:50] from the East and West and sit down with
[57:52] Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom
[57:54] of Heaven
[57:57] but the children of the Kingdom
[58:00] shall be cast out into outer Darkness
[58:03] there shall be weeping the nation of tea
[58:06] who was the kingdom too
[58:11] when Jesus was talking to the disciples
[58:14] he said I give unto thee the Keys of the
[58:16] Kingdom
[58:17] who's he talking to
[58:20] Jews Israelites whatever way you want to
[58:22] say it to make it correctly
[58:26] he wasn't speaking to the Gentiles at
[58:28] that period of time
[58:30] and come on in later
[58:34] he goes on in Matthew 23 and 37 number
[58:38] 5A said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem
[58:42] thou that killeth the prophets and stone
[58:44] us them which are sent unto thee
[58:48] how oft would I have gathered thy
[58:51] children together
[58:53] even as a hen gathered her chickens
[58:55] under her wings
[58:58] and you would not
[59:03] so we know for a certainty that eternal
[59:05] life
[59:07] was one of the things the promise is
[59:09] remember Paul said promises in one place
[59:12] the other said promise
[59:14] so we know eternal life was one thing
[59:16] they couldn't receive
[59:18] because they turned it down right
[59:21] the kingdom was one thing that was to
[59:24] them but could not
[59:26] number six John 14 25 and 26.
[59:30] these things I've spoken unto you yet
[59:32] being present with you but the comforter
[59:35] which is the Holy Ghost whom the father
[59:38] will send in my name
[59:39] he shall teach you all things and bring
[59:41] all things you remembers whatsoever I've
[59:44] said
[59:45] so by not receiving eternal life
[59:49] they didn't get the baptism of the Holy
[59:51] Ghost
[59:52] they didn't get a comforter
[59:55] now we're finding a good many promises
[59:59] that Israel never attained into
[1:00:05] Romans 3 and 1 number seven
[1:00:08] what advantage then hath to do
[1:00:12] or what prophet is there to circumcision
[1:00:16] much wherever way chiefly
[1:00:19] because that unto them were committed
[1:00:21] the Oracles of God
[1:00:26] the word of God was committed to Israel
[1:00:32] but when they turned down the word made
[1:00:34] flesh
[1:00:40] right
[1:00:45] they lost a possibility
[1:00:49] of being saved
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:54] they lost the ability for the kingdom to
[1:00:57] come into being right
[1:00:59] they never received a comforter
[1:01:05] so the death of Jesus Christ had nothing
[1:01:07] to do for them
[1:01:10] at that time
[1:01:15] the word the oraclees Earth wherever how
[1:01:18] you pronounce that word that means the
[1:01:20] word of God
[1:01:22] came to the Jews
[1:01:27] look at Romans 9 and 3 number eight
[1:01:30] for I could wish that myself were a
[1:01:33] curse from Christ for my brethren
[1:01:36] My Kinsman according to the flesh
[1:01:39] who are Israelites
[1:01:42] to whom pertaineth the adoption
[1:01:49] and the glory
[1:01:52] and the Covenants
[1:01:58] and the giving of the law
[1:02:01] and the service of God
[1:02:05] and Promises
[1:02:12] adoption pertain to Israel
[1:02:17] you and I had nothing in the Bible
[1:02:20] pertaining to us except a few types and
[1:02:23] shatters
[1:02:25] right
[1:02:26] condemnation was all we had dogs
[1:02:31] heathen
[1:02:38] aren't you glad God looked down through
[1:02:39] there and picked you up though
[1:02:48] I hope you're thinking
[1:02:54] because what were the things that was
[1:02:56] promised to Israel that they never
[1:02:57] attained unto
[1:03:00] eternal life
[1:03:01] the kingdom being present right there
[1:03:03] God would have stepped right down on
[1:03:04] Earth through the or was down there on
[1:03:06] Earth if they'd just received him
[1:03:11] you know what you and I wouldn't even be
[1:03:13] in the picture
[1:03:19] right
[1:03:20] so there were things
[1:03:22] that was promised to them that they
[1:03:25] never got
[1:03:28] but there was a group of them
[1:03:33] that did receive and were a part of the
[1:03:36] bride of Christ
[1:03:37] the reason it called Gentiles is because
[1:03:39] that just means Nations that means
[1:03:42] anybody can come in now and be in the
[1:03:43] Gentile dispensation it was really the
[1:03:46] Gen it was really the Jewish part at
[1:03:49] Pentecost
[1:03:50] because they were all Jews
[1:03:52] but then the Gentiles got brought in
[1:03:56] all right
[1:03:57] but yet all of Israel was not rejected
[1:04:00] because some of Israel came into being
[1:04:03] in this Gentile dispensation
[1:04:07] in being born again Christians
[1:04:09] but there was another part of Israel
[1:04:12] that never attained to that
[1:04:15] now that's what I want you to think
[1:04:16] about
[1:04:18] Abraham got the promise of the son Isaac
[1:04:23] Sarah received strength to conceive and
[1:04:26] bring forth the child
[1:04:30] but that never brought eternal life
[1:04:33] to Abraham and Sarah
[1:04:36] even though they were turned back to
[1:04:37] young man young woman
[1:04:39] it it didn't give them eternal life
[1:04:42] they died after then
[1:04:45] you know
[1:04:49] see then what was it that David would
[1:04:53] cry out in his spirit
[1:04:56] and seeing those psalms
[1:04:59] of they pierced my hands and my feet to
[1:05:02] sound like he's talking about his own
[1:05:03] self
[1:05:04] but yet he was prophesying of a coming
[1:05:06] Messiah
[1:05:08] all of those
[1:05:11] that was spoke of to come to Israel
[1:05:13] that's why I said we could take all of
[1:05:15] the Hebrew and keep preaching for six
[1:05:17] months or year on it
[1:05:20] and see that they did attain but yet
[1:05:24] they never got
[1:05:27] the full promise
[1:05:29] what was the definition of perfect they
[1:05:32] never came to completion they never came
[1:05:35] to an end of their lives or whatever was
[1:05:38] meant to them until this day they are
[1:05:41] vagabonds wandering the Earth
[1:05:45] fighting forever inch of ground that
[1:05:48] they have
[1:05:50] but yet God has not forsaken them
[1:05:53] brother Forney I hadn't read that but I
[1:05:55] believe it happened but some of you may
[1:05:57] know it and I didn't never read it word
[1:06:00] that that bomb was heading over toward
[1:06:01] it and it just turned and went out in
[1:06:03] the ocean
[1:06:05] I believe all that because God taking
[1:06:07] care of Israel
[1:06:08] you know I mean it looked like after a
[1:06:11] while they shot 2 000 Rockets after a
[1:06:13] while if I'd Shot 2 000 Rockets I could
[1:06:16] keep increasing my range and my ability
[1:06:19] to fire correctly
[1:06:22] even if I had to take one and walk
[1:06:23] across there you know
[1:06:26] I mean after a while I'd get something
[1:06:28] right
[1:06:28] but yet it fell all around Israel a few
[1:06:31] little things happened
[1:06:33] I mean you want to you want to live here
[1:06:35] in Lula
[1:06:39] what is it about the size of Indiana I
[1:06:42] mean no no yeah I guess it's about right
[1:06:45] Israel
[1:06:46] something like that
[1:06:48] and you got 2 000 bombs falling down and
[1:06:51] it just don't hardly do any damage
[1:06:54] looked like I'd while they get lucky
[1:06:57] you know
[1:06:59] we know there ain't no such thing as
[1:07:01] luck
[1:07:02] and we know that God is fighting for
[1:07:04] Israel
[1:07:06] brought her back to her Homeland because
[1:07:08] it was promised in the word
[1:07:12] we know that God one day
[1:07:15] will give 144 000
[1:07:18] eternal life
[1:07:20] while you're up on the Earth
[1:07:22] because it was promised
[1:07:24] to them
[1:07:25] we know that then Israel as a nation
[1:07:28] will get the millennium
[1:07:30] of this promise to them
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:36] how much they have to do in the future
[1:07:38] home I don't understand
[1:07:42] because I know we read that in the
[1:07:43] scripture that they serve a city
[1:07:47] and we know that Abraham was hunting for
[1:07:49] a city and brother Brown said he was
[1:07:52] right down under it
[1:07:54] you know
[1:07:55] all the time he said because that's
[1:07:58] where that future home is coming
[1:08:03] but my main point is
[1:08:12] what do we have to do with it
[1:08:19] well you said it want to go brother Dale
[1:08:21] the Jews brought it to us and we take it
[1:08:24] back to them
[1:08:25] all right
[1:08:29] you want to take a few thousand and send
[1:08:32] Bibles
[1:08:36] joking
[1:08:38] if it's just carrying them back that
[1:08:40] away let's just get a bunch of Bibles
[1:08:43] and we'll fly over there and we'll pass
[1:08:45] them out
[1:08:50] I'm going to do it
[1:08:52] Prophet said you can do all you want to
[1:08:56] oh yeah they have a prostolide every
[1:08:58] once in a while or maybe a part of a
[1:09:01] gentile you know bride to be in Israel
[1:09:03] you want to talk about part of the bride
[1:09:05] of Christ is in Israel now
[1:09:07] and uh
[1:09:10] but that's not the Israel we're talking
[1:09:12] about
[1:09:17] why was it that Abraham didn't get
[1:09:19] eternal life
[1:09:26] what was it David didn't get eternal
[1:09:28] life
[1:09:30] foreign
[1:09:33] myself you know everybody I know the
[1:09:36] rest of the Bible too if you know
[1:09:38] everybody's saying well brother Daniel
[1:09:40] questions the end of strife
[1:09:42] no question shows how stupid you are
[1:09:46] that's why gender strife questions
[1:09:48] showed how dumb you are because you
[1:09:50] don't know the answer to the question
[1:09:54] and if you don't know the answer to the
[1:09:55] question
[1:09:57] there's no need of running your mouth
[1:09:59] off about thinking you do
[1:10:04] huh
[1:10:06] what do we have to do with this thing
[1:10:15] we can read the rest of it and what we
[1:10:17] got down about Paul and Roman talking
[1:10:19] about that God hadn't Cast Away his
[1:10:21] people
[1:10:23] and how that some were blinded for us
[1:10:26] but some came in
[1:10:29] and received eternal life
[1:10:32] in the
[1:10:35] book of Acts right
[1:10:37] but the Israel that this mainly speaking
[1:10:40] of
[1:10:42] is still
[1:10:45] in the grave
[1:10:49] waiting on you and I
[1:10:58] all right watch the people down Through
[1:11:00] the Ages we'll cover that a little bit
[1:11:02] maybe then come back to it what did all
[1:11:05] of these down through here
[1:11:07] waiting on
[1:11:10] do the ages
[1:11:12] when to ever won we're talking about
[1:11:14] bride has eternal life
[1:11:17] they received eternal life
[1:11:19] and they're perfect in God so there's
[1:11:22] nothing we can do to raise them to make
[1:11:24] them more perfect
[1:11:27] but there's something they didn't get
[1:11:35] that's dependent upon you and I
[1:11:38] you know what that is
[1:11:41] even Paul didn't get a change in the
[1:11:43] body
[1:11:49] come on
[1:11:50] you can't put Paul waiting on a whole
[1:11:52] lot of promises one promised Paul's
[1:11:54] waiting on is that a promise he spoke of
[1:11:57] in the scripture
[1:12:00] change in a moment of Twinkle and I
[1:12:03] that's what's holding that New Testament
[1:12:05] in the ground that's why they're waiting
[1:12:08] on you and I
[1:12:16] but what connection do we have to Israel
[1:12:22] David
[1:12:24] Sampson
[1:12:32] what connection do we have
[1:12:38] to be bringing them to a completion
[1:12:43] to a finish
[1:12:46] to uh
[1:12:48] perfected state which is not sinless
[1:12:50] talking about
[1:12:52] is talking about a completion
[1:12:58] do you realize
[1:13:01] that God looked down
[1:13:07] he knew the Jews were going to do what
[1:13:10] they done
[1:13:12] right well he said he came to his own
[1:13:14] his own received it not but it means he
[1:13:16] did give you eternal life are you doing
[1:13:18] that
[1:13:19] but he knew also that there was a whole
[1:13:21] group of people called a fifth sealed
[1:13:22] Jew
[1:13:23] that would be involved into this thing
[1:13:25] that one of these days would receive
[1:13:27] eternal life
[1:13:28] one of these days would be brought in
[1:13:30] and
[1:13:31] you know
[1:13:32] but you know what
[1:13:35] by Israel turning down the new birth
[1:13:37] that Israel turning down adoptions Etc
[1:13:40] they never received the right of sonship
[1:13:44] so they will always be servants
[1:13:46] to the bride
[1:13:49] the 144 000 is servants is right right
[1:13:51] come on well then you're going to make
[1:13:53] Israel to others not to be servants and
[1:13:55] all they are because there's no way that
[1:13:58] they can come into sonship
[1:14:04] unless
[1:14:09] you
[1:14:13] can complete
[1:14:16] your journey
[1:14:23] if you can come to perfection
[1:14:28] completion
[1:14:33] and finish up what was in God's mind
[1:14:41] then you can see that they're still
[1:14:43] dependent on whether or not it can be
[1:14:45] done
[1:14:47] well I don't know where they won't ever
[1:14:50] come to change the water if we don't
[1:14:52] come to a change of a body or somebody
[1:14:54] somewhere then there's no hopes of
[1:14:57] nobody else
[1:15:00] it don't say they're they don't say
[1:15:03] you're dependent on them
[1:15:05] right it says they're dependent on you
[1:15:12] depending on you to achieve
[1:15:18] achieve the promise
[1:15:21] that he's given you
[1:15:25] a promise that was so secretively until
[1:15:28] it only Parts spoke of in the Old
[1:15:31] Testament of even types and shadows
[1:15:36] a little bit like Abraham and say return
[1:15:38] back to young man the young woman
[1:15:40] few little things spoke of
[1:15:44] Paul picks it up in spirit
[1:15:46] and he says look
[1:15:51] hold them back there
[1:15:56] and all of where we are now because
[1:15:58] remember now Paul at the time he was
[1:16:00] doing it it was still God dealing with
[1:16:02] the basics of the Jews right
[1:16:04] you with me the Gentiles were just
[1:16:06] coming in
[1:16:08] so he said something's got to happen
[1:16:11] and it was going to be changed in a
[1:16:12] moment a twinkle of an eye that
[1:16:14] somebody's got to reach a place
[1:16:19] and once they reach that place the
[1:16:21] connecting line will be back down
[1:16:22] through to bring everything else into
[1:16:24] view
[1:16:27] you realize then that the connecting
[1:16:29] line and I didn't bring the quote but
[1:16:33] let's see if I can remember it
[1:16:36] brother Joe
[1:16:38] I guess he's back there yeah nope Joe
[1:16:41] ain't there okay brother Bob one of you
[1:16:45] run in uh fall right in line
[1:16:49] it's in the Rapture message
[1:16:52] I could get the paragraph in a minute
[1:16:54] out of my memory but fall right in line
[1:16:56] and just run it into Rapture message
[1:17:00] then shoot it on the screen
[1:17:02] because you're going to see something
[1:17:07] I hope that we've
[1:17:09] waited to see
[1:17:12] what you see even all Redemptive plans
[1:17:18] you realize now here's my point so
[1:17:20] everybody with me everybody awaiting
[1:17:23] a hollering screaming or something
[1:17:27] do you realize
[1:17:31] that when Israel turned down
[1:17:35] yeah pull it off now because you got it
[1:17:38] pull it off now because I don't want him
[1:17:39] reading on it
[1:17:43] you realize
[1:17:46] that if Israel had not turned down the
[1:17:50] gospel
[1:17:52] are you with me
[1:17:54] you and I wouldn't have a change
[1:18:02] Paul sums it up by bringing it over into
[1:18:04] the scriptures
[1:18:05] and saying
[1:18:09] they stumbled Romans 11 11.
[1:18:13] but rather through their fall salvation
[1:18:16] is come
[1:18:18] to the Gentiles
[1:18:21] through the fall of Israel
[1:18:23] we could accept eternal life
[1:18:26] the thing they
[1:18:29] turned down
[1:18:36] come on
[1:18:39] you think they without us you bring it
[1:18:41] all down here
[1:18:44] you realize when they turned down
[1:18:46] salvation the Jews
[1:18:49] there was no hopes of it coming into
[1:18:52] being
[1:18:55] come on now
[1:18:56] think with me don't think well yes it
[1:18:59] would have been this and it would have
[1:19:00] been bad no
[1:19:03] when they turned it down it was left
[1:19:06] desolate unto them that's what the
[1:19:09] scripture says
[1:19:10] since their house has become desolate
[1:19:16] those that become desolate too
[1:19:19] and no hope
[1:19:23] but God wouldn't satisfy I'd believe it
[1:19:30] he looked down and he used all of his
[1:19:33] types and his Shadows
[1:19:37] he used Ruth and Boaz
[1:19:40] he used those types and shadows
[1:19:45] and he looked out to her and he says
[1:19:49] you choose
[1:19:51] you've rejected it
[1:19:55] and I know some of you ain't gonna like
[1:19:56] this wording it's all right you tell me
[1:19:59] what it is
[1:20:00] brother random said God deliberately
[1:20:04] blinded Israel
[1:20:06] I know a lot of people blind themselves
[1:20:09] but you're going to have to argue with
[1:20:11] that quote
[1:20:13] that God deliberately put his hand over
[1:20:16] Israel's eyes why because he knew they
[1:20:19] would not have it
[1:20:21] and that there was no way to get it into
[1:20:24] being
[1:20:25] except he moved to another group of
[1:20:28] people
[1:20:32] and all alone he had in his mind
[1:20:35] Ruth and Boaz and all those types and
[1:20:38] shadows
[1:20:39] that they would be a little Gentile
[1:20:41] bride
[1:20:42] they would be a little bride
[1:20:47] because you know what like I said while
[1:20:49] ago it was used on the death Pentecost
[1:20:51] he was used in the book of Acts but you
[1:20:53] know what it's called Gentile
[1:20:56] that's what it's called
[1:20:59] the Gentile Kingdom actually started on
[1:21:02] the death Pentecost
[1:21:05] because we accepted it right
[1:21:10] right because the Gentiles accepted it
[1:21:15] that put Israel in a preserved or
[1:21:18] whatever we don't call it position
[1:21:22] that they could not attain unto it then
[1:21:24] they had turned it down
[1:21:28] you remember the little woman
[1:21:31] he called her a dog
[1:21:37] right she said that's right Master but
[1:21:40] said the dogs it's a crumbs they fall
[1:21:43] from the Masters table
[1:21:46] he looked down at that little woman and
[1:21:48] he said you got what you asked for
[1:21:51] and said every word of the world that
[1:21:53] this gospel goes your name will be spoke
[1:21:56] of
[1:22:03] right and remindeth he
[1:22:09] can't you just see a man
[1:22:13] and I'm just making it as plain as I can
[1:22:15] Nora
[1:22:17] that he's getting ready for a wedding
[1:22:20] to marry a bunch of people I mean Mary a
[1:22:23] bride
[1:22:27] and he sees this beautiful bride
[1:22:32] and he sees her little helper
[1:22:34] that's a wash woman
[1:22:38] dog
[1:22:42] so
[1:22:43] he says all right
[1:22:45] that's my wife we're going to get
[1:22:47] married
[1:22:49] but he found Israel to be pregnated to
[1:22:51] the devil
[1:22:53] come on he said run around said she was
[1:22:55] in adultery that's why God couldn't come
[1:22:57] to Israel he was already sold out into
[1:23:00] adultery
[1:23:02] she was already into heathenisms in the
[1:23:04] thing
[1:23:06] and he said okay
[1:23:08] I'll put you away
[1:23:13] did he
[1:23:15] he put Israel away
[1:23:21] he turned around and he says
[1:23:25] little Gentile dog
[1:23:29] little horse woman
[1:23:31] you got to character the nature of the
[1:23:33] things that I've been looking for
[1:23:38] so I'll just take you
[1:23:41] she said I'll take it
[1:23:46] she would say be it unto me
[1:23:52] according to Thy Word
[1:23:58] a little group of people
[1:24:01] accepted salvation
[1:24:07] but you know what God didn't
[1:24:10] throw away Israel
[1:24:15] he put her away for adultery
[1:24:18] now then and remember one thing
[1:24:21] I know the people of this message preach
[1:24:23] it wrong about that but you remember one
[1:24:25] thing I want the Bible for it and I want
[1:24:27] the prophet's message where God ever
[1:24:29] marries Israel back his wife
[1:24:33] come on now I got scripture you can do
[1:24:35] what you want to I know what it says
[1:24:37] return unto me backslidden Israel as far
[1:24:39] as I'm married unto thee
[1:24:42] that is a time frame scripture that was
[1:24:45] in that day that is not a scripture
[1:24:48] speaking of the end time
[1:24:50] because if it does then you've got him
[1:24:52] marrying a prostitute again and he won't
[1:24:55] do it
[1:24:57] Israel will not come back to being bride
[1:25:01] nowhere even 144 000 that get eternal
[1:25:04] life here will be servants to the bride
[1:25:09] and even though Israel will be for the
[1:25:11] Millennium and they'll have all the
[1:25:12] promises God gave them
[1:25:14] that they can take and do and all of
[1:25:16] that
[1:25:19] some were chosen like Abraham Isaac and
[1:25:21] Jacob to sit down at the welcome table
[1:25:23] which is the marriage supper
[1:25:25] as guests
[1:25:31] but he won't take them back his wife
[1:25:35] because he won't put away a woman and
[1:25:37] take her back when she's in adultery
[1:25:38] because he wouldn't put her away the
[1:25:39] first time if he didn't die Deuteronomy
[1:25:41] 24 24 I mean 24 if you want to get in
[1:25:44] the Bible
[1:25:46] he won't do that he can't return unto a
[1:25:50] there's nothing to cleanse Israel in the
[1:25:53] dispensation that we are because they
[1:25:55] rejected him
[1:25:57] but when we leave out of here
[1:26:00] it'll go back to the 144 000.
[1:26:05] and by going back to the hundred and
[1:26:06] forty four thousand
[1:26:09] then
[1:26:11] Israel will receive the Gospel of the
[1:26:13] Kingdom
[1:26:14] and there will be in the millennium
[1:26:17] and I believe they'll be given eternal
[1:26:18] life
[1:26:21] I believe that
[1:26:23] there'll never be the bride of Christ
[1:26:27] they rejected it
[1:26:30] now do you understand why they without
[1:26:33] us cannot be brought to a completion
[1:26:37] they without us that have received
[1:26:40] Christ
[1:26:44] we are then what's keeping the wrath of
[1:26:48] God off of Israel
[1:26:52] the bride of Christ
[1:26:56] I know it's going around now and I heard
[1:26:57] it up at Ruth
[1:26:59] and I note of it before but
[1:27:02] I'm not saying nothing other than one
[1:27:04] thing
[1:27:05] people are saying that the Old Testament
[1:27:07] Saints were made perfect in the
[1:27:09] resurrection of Jesus Christ and came
[1:27:11] forth in glorified bodies and and walked
[1:27:13] upon the Earth back there with Jesus and
[1:27:15] thank and you got a lot of quotes
[1:27:21] they got a lot of quotes
[1:27:26] but all I ask you to do is just read a
[1:27:29] little
[1:27:32] I didn't give it here but
[1:27:34] they could probably find it by the time
[1:27:36] we read this other one
[1:27:38] read around and said one day
[1:27:41] Adam will reach over and Shake Eve try
[1:27:43] that one it may be right in the message
[1:27:45] just Abraham Adam will shake Eve evil
[1:27:48] Shake Abel
[1:27:51] and a resurrection will come
[1:27:55] in the book of Acts it says David
[1:27:58] septuager our grave is with us till this
[1:28:01] day
[1:28:04] surely David would have been one that
[1:28:06] would have been raised
[1:28:09] did you get it okay
[1:28:10] there you go he's taking the message
[1:28:12] inspiration 1956.
[1:28:15] the Williamsburg Kentucky I want to know
[1:28:18] amen as the poet in the song said I can
[1:28:20] see Adam Shake Eve and say Eve this is
[1:28:23] it honey he reaches over and shakes Abel
[1:28:26] and said Abel Abel Shake say it says say
[1:28:29] it shakes no one nor shakes Abraham look
[1:28:31] where it's coming amen the time has come
[1:28:34] know him in the power of his
[1:28:36] resurrection know that by my inspiration
[1:28:38] that's been leading me and been classed
[1:28:42] a fanatic and whatsoever it's what more
[1:28:46] it brought to me to the line it's
[1:28:48] brought me to the playing of the price
[1:28:51] what
[1:28:53] Those Old Testament Saints
[1:28:55] they're waiting on you and I
[1:29:00] why would your Prophet say Adam would
[1:29:02] reach over and get Eve if they raised
[1:29:05] back there physically
[1:29:07] and walked into the city as is taught I
[1:29:10] don't understand it
[1:29:11] I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
[1:29:13] I'm just saying I don't understand it
[1:29:15] and you don't want to know I don't
[1:29:17] understand something obviously I don't
[1:29:18] understand because that way you can help
[1:29:20] me
[1:29:22] all right now go ahead and pull up the
[1:29:23] one from the Rapture and we'll get that
[1:29:25] one so you see I wouldn't intending to
[1:29:27] bring all of this point
[1:29:30] paragraph 178 one day there will come
[1:29:32] obliged from Heaven and the dead in
[1:29:34] Christ shall rise first
[1:29:37] listen
[1:29:39] them Old Testament Saints back Yonder
[1:29:45] who are waiting Will Blast forth and
[1:29:48] come out of their first
[1:29:50] and go into the resurrection
[1:29:53] we'll drop right in line going into the
[1:29:56] sky
[1:29:58] these old Mortal
[1:30:00] bodies changed and made like unto his
[1:30:03] own glorious body
[1:30:05] what a parade that'll be
[1:30:07] the Rapture in time
[1:30:15] that's all I told you brother when I
[1:30:17] discussed that with him years ago
[1:30:21] as brother Branham could put
[1:30:23] all of that over at one time
[1:30:29] you say yeah but that's not the
[1:30:31] that's not the dead in Christ who rise
[1:30:32] first your Prophet started off with the
[1:30:34] dead in Christ shall rise for because it
[1:30:36] is a responsibility to those that are
[1:30:38] alive for the dead to rise first
[1:30:46] and then we which arrive and remain
[1:30:48] shall be changed
[1:30:52] so what's the word waiting on
[1:30:54] you and I
[1:30:56] adoption time let me read the last one
[1:30:58] then
[1:30:59] we'll quit go ahead down to number 10
[1:31:01] brother
[1:31:03] taken from the message of the Statue of
[1:31:05] a perfect man you get it these people
[1:31:07] who died in dire are depending and
[1:31:09] waiting on us
[1:31:11] so this church has got to come to
[1:31:13] perfection in order to bring the
[1:31:16] resurrection and they're they're under
[1:31:19] sold under the altar waiting for a
[1:31:22] church to come to a Perfection then
[1:31:25] Jesus comes
[1:31:28] he comes
[1:31:30] adoption he's waiting on you and I where
[1:31:33] he can pull in his fullness
[1:31:35] to raise the dead and we'll go into
[1:31:36] rapture
[1:31:40] I'm just saying
[1:31:42] my point is what connection did we have
[1:31:46] see when they turned it down we accepted
[1:31:49] it
[1:31:50] but what if we hadn't accepted it
[1:31:55] where would you be today had you not
[1:31:58] accepted Jesus Christ as your savior
[1:32:03] number two where would you be the day
[1:32:06] had you not accepted this message
[1:32:13] sitting in them churches smoking
[1:32:15] drinking having a big time shouting
[1:32:17] Glory Hallelujah and saying the Rapture
[1:32:19] is coming
[1:32:21] right I'm honest now that's not thrown
[1:32:24] off on nobody
[1:32:25] that's left up to them that's not to me
[1:32:28] and you
[1:32:29] I'm not against anybody
[1:32:31] I prayed earlier today I thought Lord
[1:32:33] don't let people think I'm against them
[1:32:37] I'm not
[1:32:38] I don't care where you agree with me or
[1:32:40] not I'm not against you
[1:32:42] you can believe what you want to
[1:32:46] I don't mean it's writing I'm going to
[1:32:48] to compromise with you no
[1:32:51] but I'm not going to do christianize you
[1:32:53] and send you to hell because you don't
[1:32:54] believe in what Lula teaches
[1:33:03] but they without us cannot be made
[1:33:05] perfect
[1:33:08] them Old Testament Saints can't come out
[1:33:10] their bodies can't come out of the
[1:33:11] ground
[1:33:12] you say yeah but the Bible says they've
[1:33:14] already okay that's all right
[1:33:16] I just asked you one question
[1:33:19] Jesus had two ascensions
[1:33:26] read your Bible
[1:33:29] when he raised from the dead and
[1:33:31] appeared to Mary
[1:33:32] don't touch me I'm not yet ascended he
[1:33:34] went right straight up
[1:33:37] he come right back
[1:33:39] stayed for 30 40 days and send it again
[1:33:44] is that right that's in the book of Acts
[1:33:48] that's the only thing
[1:33:51] but I hope you catch one thing
[1:33:54] by Israel turning it down and by you
[1:33:56] accepting it that did leave Israel with
[1:33:59] a hoax that God would not totally
[1:34:02] annihilate them but he would look at
[1:34:04] that little bride and he would see that
[1:34:06] little bride and he'd say this little
[1:34:08] bride is is what I wanted this was my my
[1:34:11] goal my achievement but this is my
[1:34:13] people
[1:34:15] he came to his own and his own received
[1:34:17] it this is my people and one day I bring
[1:34:20] my people
[1:34:24] come on
[1:34:28] Joseph was down in Egypt
[1:34:32] and one day his people came
[1:34:39] and Pharaoh said
[1:34:42] Joseph you take the best you put your
[1:34:46] daddy and your family out there on it it
[1:34:49] belongs to you
[1:34:51] they had to be a pharaoh come up that
[1:34:53] didn't know Joseph before they could
[1:34:55] start hurting them anyway because he had
[1:34:57] already decreed
[1:34:58] this is the hers
[1:35:02] I guess he might have been a little
[1:35:04] upset when he found out they were sheep
[1:35:06] herders
[1:35:07] because remember Joseph lied to him he
[1:35:10] said they were catarasers herzmen
[1:35:16] I guess he was a little upset but he
[1:35:18] said I can put up with sheep
[1:35:21] he loved Joseph
[1:35:24] wouldn't you love a man that had saved
[1:35:26] your kingdom
[1:35:28] that had preserved all of your whole
[1:35:31] land and kept you intact as king
[1:35:34] well he was second in command
[1:35:38] right
[1:35:41] do you understand all of these types and
[1:35:42] shatters
[1:35:44] parts that we look at
[1:35:47] I'm going to say it one more time
[1:35:49] by them turning it down it would have
[1:35:51] left it a null to everybody
[1:35:53] there was no hope
[1:35:57] that there was a little group of people
[1:36:02] that would receive it
[1:36:05] and he says okay
[1:36:07] I take this because it's what I wanted
[1:36:10] but I'll preserve the rest of it
[1:36:12] one day that Millennium is going to be a
[1:36:14] great thing because that Jews is going
[1:36:16] to be there as a nation your Prophet
[1:36:18] said and they're going to have a
[1:36:20] millennium Temple Ezekiel 40-44 erected
[1:36:23] on Earth not a temple to offer
[1:36:26] sacrifices no but a temple to show
[1:36:30] that you and I can go in there and tell
[1:36:32] them Jews look you built this yes we
[1:36:34] built that do you know what that means
[1:36:37] let's say we really don't know
[1:36:41] said this is what it means
[1:36:43] this is speaking of Jesus Christ you
[1:36:46] remember running around and said them
[1:36:47] Jews never didn't understand the two
[1:36:49] loaves
[1:36:51] because he said he said I didn't
[1:36:53] understand him too low he said if they'd
[1:36:54] done it
[1:36:59] back on these things let's Stand
[1:37:01] Together
[1:37:01] sorry to be a little empty this evening
[1:37:03] but I wanted to get that to a point now
[1:37:05] maybe next Sunday we'll review some of
[1:37:08] this and we'll have questions and
[1:37:10] answers
[1:37:11] next Sunday morning maybe or something
[1:37:14] or whatever
[1:37:16] I could keep preaching on this part but
[1:37:18] I want to move into another couple of
[1:37:21] things
[1:37:23] and you know and in doing that it'll
[1:37:25] come right out of this
[1:37:27] and unfold I hope
[1:37:29] and pray
[1:37:32] what do we got brother
[1:37:37] 167 anybody have a need
[1:37:40] foreign
[1:37:44] think on these things
[1:37:49] by their rejection
[1:37:51] we receive
[1:37:53] by the rejection of the gentile people
[1:37:55] in the end time God will turn back
[1:37:58] to Israel
[1:38:01] they brought it to us we take it to them
[1:38:05] with that little ride was in his mind
[1:38:07] the whole time
[1:38:13] you think about a God that for 6 000
[1:38:16] years planned and moved everything so
[1:38:19] perfectly
[1:38:21] till everything was perfect in types and
[1:38:23] shatters and then he walked right down
[1:38:26] to make sure the rest of it would come
[1:38:29] right
[1:38:30] he done it himself he never sent a son
[1:38:34] to die he said I'm going myself
[1:38:37] I want to make sure it's all right right
[1:38:40] and all taken care of what do we got
[1:38:42] brother 167 in the red book anybody have
[1:38:45] a need
[1:38:47] when things
[1:38:58] Bill Jesus came and made me oh I
[1:39:04] wouldn't be back
[1:39:09] I would not be
[1:39:12] denied
[1:39:14] I would not be denied
[1:39:19] fill Jesus came and made me with asking
[1:39:24] the nurse
[1:39:26] we were going to put it on the armband
[1:39:28] type of thing you don't fix it
[1:39:32] I reckon that lady knew what she do
[1:39:37] she got a piece of tape she just takes
[1:39:40] me
[1:39:44] practice
[1:39:57] go away
[1:40:02] comes from you and we believe you and
[1:40:06] now remove the pain and the agony in
[1:40:08] Jesus name
[1:40:13] was gone anybody else
[1:40:17] what about it
[1:40:19] look what an honor the word is done in
[1:40:25] Christ
[1:40:33] what a great thing it is to be to be the
[1:40:35] bride of Christ
[1:40:39] he put everything right into her
[1:40:45] all the promises
[1:40:51] every promise in the book is mine
[1:40:54] I need to just write my name down say
[1:40:58] thank you Lord that's mine if mine
[1:41:10] we lay our hands upon our brother just
[1:41:12] asking to take care of all the problems
[1:41:14] the troubles and the heartaches and
[1:41:16] things that exist there we believe that
[1:41:20] you'll give him strength and things
[1:41:21] courage to walk forth in you and believe
[1:41:25] that all is well in Jesus name
[1:41:30] anybody else
[1:41:40] what a wonderful thing
[1:41:45] you say everything is dependent upon
[1:41:48] whether or not he was God
[1:41:51] it's good
[1:41:53] but he said everything's dependent upon
[1:41:56] whether you can believe who you are
[1:42:00] oh
[1:42:02] these things are possible to God he said
[1:42:04] all things are possible to them that
[1:42:07] believe
[1:42:15] you say
[1:42:17] you speak
[1:42:20] I would not
[1:42:23] hold on a minute
[1:42:25] you know I've always kind of cut up a
[1:42:27] little bit maybe I'm wrong I'm sorry
[1:42:30] a lot of you know what I mean and
[1:42:32] what I'm saying about it and I've said
[1:42:34] something to like sister Anna to Sister
[1:42:37] Trudy and some of these people
[1:42:40] they speak languages and things and
[1:42:43] I've asked this question
[1:42:45] I've always said you know when
[1:42:48] when you're speaking we say dog
[1:42:51] all right
[1:42:52] and you know
[1:42:54] I said now when you're speaking in your
[1:42:56] language
[1:42:57] what do you mean
[1:43:00] they said well we're being dog I said
[1:43:03] well why don't you say dog
[1:43:05] and say what is Spanish petroleum you
[1:43:08] know it's it's a different wording in
[1:43:10] every country for dog
[1:43:13] right
[1:43:15] but you know everybody means dog
[1:43:18] right
[1:43:20] Brother Ray was talking about it
[1:43:23] now if it's our today that God showed
[1:43:25] him something about
[1:43:26] that
[1:43:28] you know
[1:43:30] a lot of these things can't be true to a
[1:43:32] lot of people accuse God of because he
[1:43:33] has no attributes for that
[1:43:36] he can't have hate there's
[1:43:38] he had no attributes
[1:43:41] it can't be
[1:43:42] and what I told him was what I was
[1:43:44] thinking of
[1:43:46] it's a funny little thing but it means a
[1:43:48] lot to me
[1:43:50] you know
[1:43:52] in languages you've got different words
[1:43:54] for different things you know this one
[1:43:57] will but it all means the same Basics
[1:44:00] right
[1:44:01] it'll all mean a dog or a horse or a cow
[1:44:05] you know there's no such thing as a
[1:44:08] mixed up revelation
[1:44:10] all Revelation is the same in every
[1:44:13] language
[1:44:17] God could speak to a house full of a
[1:44:20] hundred different languages
[1:44:22] and every one of them could get a
[1:44:24] revelation of the same thing
[1:44:29] so then when we get there we won't have
[1:44:31] to worry about talking to nobody and
[1:44:33] trying to get an interpreter
[1:44:40] his thoughts
[1:44:42] are perfect
[1:44:45] and a word is a thought expressed
[1:44:48] during the day of Pentecost they was
[1:44:50] right
[1:44:51] how here we ever man in our own tongue
[1:44:55] wherein we were born
[1:44:57] names about eight or nine languages
[1:45:01] and every one of them understood the one
[1:45:04] speaker
[1:45:06] oh smart alec man comes up with the 12
[1:45:09] apostles were interpreters
[1:45:12] it didn't say that
[1:45:15] he said how here they ever man
[1:45:19] Revelation had only one
[1:45:22] voice
[1:45:28] Lord Jesus
[1:45:30] we love you
[1:45:32] just go home with us help us
[1:45:35] guide us and bless us and keep us
[1:45:37] forgive our sins most of all
[1:45:40] lead us in thine understanding help us
[1:45:42] to see what you're trying to say to each
[1:45:44] one of us
[1:45:46] we love you father
[1:45:48] and just have your way
[1:45:50] bless each one be with their wife
[1:45:52] deliver that Lord be with these others
[1:45:53] brother radar we told him just going
[1:45:55] back because he's healed we believe it
[1:46:00] and father we believe that by your
[1:46:01] stripes we are healed of whatever we
[1:46:04] have need of
[1:46:06] it's the finished product
[1:46:08] and it's the same language around the
[1:46:11] world
[1:46:12] by your stripes we are healed
[1:46:15] we love you Lord and we thank you in
[1:46:17] Jesus name
[1:46:19] you dismissed
[1:46:29] we shall be changed
[1:46:36] to immortality
[1:46:39] changed in a twinkling of an eye
[1:46:44] we shall be changed
[1:46:49] we
