the house of the Lord If you'd like to turn in your scriptures where we've been reading turn to Revelations 1 and then we'll go to Ephesians 1 and try to continue the thought on that we were talking on this morning Remember now the Lord willing brother Forny will be with us to minister for us this coming Wednesday I chose that because we're going to move move over the fellowship meeting and that way Wade can take one service next weekend and I can take one and that'll kind of balance up cause of the fellowship meeting and two I'm supposed to have a tooth implant You know they're going to drill a hole drive one and rod down inside of your jaw you know all this that and supposed to do that Tuesday So y'all remember me at that time that they'll get it in there right because if those things don't work you take them out and throw them away and it's the same cost whether they work or not They don't seem to care whether they work They just want to get them in there But you know pray the Lord will make it all work out to to the right All right And then brother Forny be with us Remember we'll be leaving the Lord willing now 10:00 on Saturday going to the fellowship meeting at brother Tom Kershain Remember that Pray that the Lord would be with us All that all who want to go now let us know where we can make arrangements and get everything in the right order because that's the longest trip we have because it's all the way across the mountain area It's a hard drive but remember that Anything else we all remember brother Gary pray the Lord would would touch him and bring him on out of this situation that he's in because we believe the word We believe the word says it We believe that by his stripes he's healed You know the Lord's stripes brother Gary's healed And we believe that We just ask him to apply it then to him to deliver him out of it All right And just and remember Rebecca you know during the time because her having to take care of him is hard on her to you know to working with and doing with him and everything you know And I pray that the Lord would bless her All right Uh that's all I guess Father we thank you for all that you've given us We know that you've given to us freely So we don't have to pay for anything That's a wonderful thing And Lord what about a day and an hour don't have to buy a thing Don't have to pay for nothing All we got to do is believe it and accept it and let you do the rest of it We ask you now that you'd be with us and that you'd touch each heart and lives this afternoon that we may see you through the opening of your word and Lord be led therein that your light would shine Father you said that through the prophet that when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for then she will then be an invincible army So Lord we've had 40 something years to try to prepare since the leaving of the prophet and we pray that you would just help each and every one of us forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us in Jesus' name Amen All right Revelations 1 verse 12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle His head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine bryce and as if they burned in a furnace and his voice is a sound of many waters We won't we don't want to go on to any further We will go a little further eventually but that's all right We want to try to get this point then we'll move on cuz I hope that you're relating what we're reading in Revelations to what we're doing now because it's talking about where he is now in you and I All right let's go to Ephesians now and we'll read starting with verse nine to save time Having made ver Ephesians 1 vers9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory You first trusted in Christ In whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation In whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory You may be seated The Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word Remember we use also Ephesians 4:30 to talk about whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption All right now to not back up a lot but to just maybe pick up a few thoughts and then continue on into the message of what we're seeing now I want you to put this into your mind and I want you to think because this is the way I I think All right and uh you know I count myself to be the dumbest of dummies And if if the dummy can think then surely you ought to be able to think a whole lot better than I do you know and and understand because that's the way I count it That's not a uh just trying to be an humble you know me No no That's the way I count it Because remember the Bible says everything we have what God gave it to us Now that's scripture Okay Now I I've years ago I saw something in the prophet's message and I've tried to express it for somewhere in the 30 years at least and through about 82 and right in there when I begin to preach on the seals and the Daniel 70 weeks and the thing and I saw something of how that you can take the Bible and the prophets message you know and you can you can lay a subject or a thought or try to bring a a um message through the Bible and you can relate it I do it like this You can you can relate the whole Bible and all and bring it to in relation to faith which is your new birth All right and no matter what depth the prophet brings it or the Bible goes through those things will all u bring forth the same story Beautiful picture just enhances or what is the word uh magnifies or or whatever you want to do See then you can turn around and and see you say well okay it takes justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to to get to faith All right we believe that the new birth See then you got to climbing up the pyramid the statue of a perfect man up to where it says Holy Spirit And when you do then you can in that take the scriptures and the things that will be that we want to relate this group to this this group to this and this group to this And that that works out That's all right That's doing But remember you can't have this bringing something and the second stage bringing something different and the third stage bringing something different Right you can't do that throughout the Bible See because what would it do you'd have a white dog here and a black dog here and a pale dog here and and you'd just be all messed up Because you see the prophet when he brings the message he brings justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be the new birth up through the statue of a perfect man You can take justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to climb the statue of a perfect man because it's the opening of the word Then the headstone when it comes you can cover it through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and see like you get into invisible union I believe is one of them especially where he really covers if you'll read the message or listen to it you'll hear him talking about justification he's just talking about the new birth but all at once it seems like he just takes a great leap into things and and you got to really listen because he'll say here he'll say justification chopped off your p sins that's Then in a minute he'll say you know it it's not that it said it's it's you're forgiven All right Then in a little bit in the message he'll say the real you never did do it Right Well he's done went into three stages of development or whatever you want to call it through into one message that would carry a believer in this day from this faith at the bottom all the way through the pyramid and out to the headstone Amen And be the same scriptures Amen Right Let's see if I can get to one in mind What is it i'll think of it in a minute Uh where he refers and brother Brandham puts it in the millennium He relates that scripture puts it in the millennium Well I thought well now okay I better keep studying this thought because I'm trying to bring it this way And I kept going through the message and running the quotes And after a while I found that he takes one scripture puts it places it in the millennium Then in a little while he's got the same scripture in the future home He didn't have to go get him another scripture you know he he's taking that same scripture but it keeps climbing higher and higher throughout the word All right and you can't make this over here one scripture and then make the same scripture contrary It won't work folks That don't work in the Bible Amen It don't work in the prophet's message So then sometimes we need to sit down and think about what's being said All right Now the same thing to me in the new birth You can't take how you come to the new birth and make your growth or development of the stature of a very man some other way and then the headstone coming to be some other way or thought It's further development It's just opening up of the same scripture as you're climbing and see one person sitting there then and I realize that and I I watch it and and a lot of times if you'll notice me I'll say something to kind of click it because I'll see that part of the group is on on the justification you know all right and part of the group is developed enough to understand that it can be fit into a deeper meaning then I I see that some can put it over here into a higher meaning and it's all the same Bible That's what's so wonderful The new birth right here and brother Brandham said you're birthed into these virtues And then you must be birthed into the headstone Amen All right And now you'll see then why the prophet said as we were giving this morning getting to that point he said why you'll see that there is is not too many genuine new births now I'm sure that when he said that he thought he probably was thinking well that's right because the Bible says is fear not little flock you know it's the father's good pleasure all right but I keep that is the way that I do and the way I think and it'll just climb and it'll climb and it'll climb and it'll climb and climb on out until I hope one of these days we leave here all right now what were we talking about this morning the new birth is not your shouting your crying your doings That is the after effect of the birth That's what you do after you have the birth All right then the new birth then is the birth of the word and it's the word you've heard And we went through that with the scripture that they took the word and kept it in the parables And then it was the moisture came and it produced uh 20 40 60 or what 20 40 800 whatever it goes And I told you that's not meaning uh that this is not as good as this over here It's the same 20 and 40 is just two times that But it's not two times that It's just the same thing in another way of expressing it And see but if you'll take it and follow it you'll follow it Say Luther's age was justification and all they could produce was that part which would say 20% of what needed to be done Wesley's age maybe 40% This age has got to come to the 100% or 60fold or whatever It's got to be done in this age because there's got to be a change All right And I've went over it and went over it Here's one more time You're not born again in your body You're not born again in your spirit You're born again in your soul All right Then justification being a work of the Holy Spirit Sanctification being a work of the Holy Spirit But the baptism is the Holy Spirit Remember that quote All right So then justification is working on the soul of the individual Amen To get that individual to repent to clean out you know All right Sanctification comes into the cleansing and setting aside of the individual And it took Jesus about three and a half years to finally come to word that he could say in St John 17 you know you're clean through the word spoken unto you Sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth All right so you're justified by faith by accepting Jesus Christ as your savior repentance followed by water baptism to show your repentance is correct and that your faith is is genuine in yourself and then you're cleansed by the word of God that you hear and that comes by as we we're in the scripture know faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God all right that's what cleanses us and that's why a lot of people's not clean now I'm not throwing no stones I just plainly talk That's why you see that a lot of people especially you follow the ranks of the message people and you'll see them in the altar and I'm you forgive me if you think I'm going wrong cuz I'm not It's you thinking wrong right but you'll see somebody in the altar one day praying crying shouting glory hallelujah They get up they're okay But you go to the next meeting especially a year later the same person is in the altar crying praying Now don't think I'm against that I'm just saying why didn't they get something you think the preachers of this message ain't going to have to stand one day and give an answer now may I quote the scripture did not Jesus say you what you stand in the door and won't go in and won't let them go in What about a bunch of people that you could talk about like that or just one person it would be or whatever that somebody that would stand in the door that person would have to be vastly deceived cuz truly they wouldn't be wanting to do that in their own to deceive But they're so deceived until they think they're right and they won't let nobody else come in and they won't go in themselves All right Now but we talked about that coming to the new birth Then the one thing the disciples needed after they come through the justification by faith the cleansing of the washing of the water of the word So you can use that there and then you can use it over later and all And uh then they would come to the point that they had heard the word and the word had driven out that unclean spirit out of the soul of those individuals but yet they were still not right Right Great mechanical situation you would call it you know that they would uh be said in the word that they would believe the word and they would see signs and wonders miracles transpiring but yet they would not have the moisture to make the word live All right So if the seed is the word of God then you must have life to come you know something to cause that to come forth So what the disciples needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost And you know what brother Brown said the problem with Judas what did he say he didn't make it to Pentecost That's right He don't throw off on him He don't preach no long lengthy sermons how bad a devil Judas was Right No he just tells it like it is And the Bible said he was a thief from the beginning He just puts it in the way it is But everybody else must have thought he's a pretty good guy cuz he was the secretary and treasurer the you know the the paid the bills All right But now he didn't make it to Pentecost Right see he didn't take the word that the others had allowed that word to develop them into a situation that God could come on the scene then and quicken that word to those disciples All right And at 120 they uh they held on Amen But he was seen of over 500 brethren Let's see if I can pick that up Brother Joe who's back brother Joe pull up five 4a and let's read first Corinthians 15 All right Because we need to do that A lot of people you know some people say "I don't know whether that's in the Bible I was talking to a man one day." He said "I don't even know whether that's in the message or not." I said "You'll hang on just a minute I'll give it to you but I'll tell you what it is." I said 'If that ain't what the prophet said I said 'I'll hang my sign on my back and you can call me anything you want to Well he wasn't interested in me taking long enough to look it up But see a lot of people don't think about the scriptures And look what it says And he that was buried and that he was buried and that he arose again the third day according to the scriptures And that he was seen of Cphus everybody how you pronounce that word Then of the 12 Then after that he was seen of above 500 brethren at once Which means if that opportunity happened there was probably a whole lot more than that right in different ways but at one time Now watch what he says of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep after he seen of James next he was seen of him born out of due season he doesn't say that those 500 was lost he calls them brethren and he says even the greatest portion of them still remain you know witnesses all But why didn't they go to the upper room amen They evidently didn't let that word come inside of them to clean out that unclean spirit that doing But yet they were great religious people Could that be you and I well brother Dale you are not preached to people who's been in the message a long time that they need to be born again Well who am I going to preach it to amen You know I mean I believe the greatest missionary place in the world is in America to the people of this so-called message that they need missionaries more than anywhere in the world to come express to them what the prophet has said You remember what I told the brother when we went to overseas together and they were done a mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar marvelous job of presenting the prophet and the message and I told him I said but brother I said what are you going to do next year are you going to take that same 300 people that you had are you going to put them through the same story of the prophet and the message and the Bible I said why not put that 300 over in a group to theirel and let somebody teach what the prophet taught and then get you two or 30 hund more to start with Well even from a foreign country came the message that said "You've brought us the prophet's message Now come and teach us what he said." But get off of it But you see Romans 10:17 says "Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word." So then the new birth is the birth of the word right and it's the word you hear I said it there the other day and I keep saying it See all of this doctrines and ideas of you come here with this seed in you I believe what the prophet said about that I've preached it to you I believe you come here with this you come here with eternal life I believe the way he says it that if you if you have eternal life you always was eternal I believe John says that if his seed remainth in you he you cannot sin I believe that What is it can't sin the seed I believe that I don't Would it be a wonderful night the anointing of that Holy Spirit I can find ever you would be taking away all your scriptures and all your things by doing that So I wrote it like this Do you truly understand about the soul what do you think about it the soul of mankind What do you think of the new birth see I believe the new birth is the birth of the word that you have heard and you let it drive out that and has driven out the old nature of that soul by the word that you've heard not driven the soul out See just don't don't take all those things out That's why we spent that part on a new heart and a new spirit Because remember now our nature of the cleansing is not the body It's not the spirit The nature of cleansing has to be in the heart The Bible says I give you a new heart a new spirit All right and the heart being in the soul right the heart being the soul of mankind So it wasn't when your soul went out It when your body went out or when your spirit it went out It's God working on the nature from the inside out Because you can have every bit of it lined up in the flesh and that will not save you You can stop doing or quit doing or do do or whatever you want to do It don't matter You remember brother Ram said that way day he said that man said what must we do to be saved he said "We tell him what he ought to quit We tell him what he ought to do." Said he didn't ask that question He asked the question "How can I say to be saved?" We don't tell him how to be saved We tell him how to quit Oh that's well and good But if there's not a birth there it's only legalism forms you have See by the planting of the word you know the sowing of the word Now take this please just for a minute and take it like I was trying to explain a minute ago Take the 40 something years that we've heard the prophet's message that even you would claim the new birth What has it done for us and what has it done to most of the preachers of this message when most of them it's been around 40 years are turning against the prophet they've done every kind of thing I don't get it see by the planting of the natural seed into the ground you can come forth with whatever you plant all right so then by the planting of the word pure and unadulterated Then you can expect a new nature to come within the individual which would be dwelling in the person's heart or soul See because that's what you're looking at It's not to destroy your soul but it's to wash that soul or to change its nature Right Right now is it true the prophet said "If it was possible for you to take that nature out of that hog and put the nature of the lamb in the hog he said the lamb would control the nature of the hog and the hog wouldn't be a hog anymore rooting in the ground." All right See now we tried to cover this and just hid it See you cannot birth word God cannot birth a trinity because there's no such a thing Right Something clicked on the air conditioner brother Aaron So don't let us get too hot Even if you have to run the fan See you cannot birth word that is not pure How can you How can you birth a trinity i got a revelation of the trinity Now where'd you get it it's not even in the Bible So how'd you get it all right Now watch the point of what I'm driving at on that You cannot birth the old nature no more than you can birth a trinity to anybody You can't birth the old nature That's why it has to be that that unclean spirit is driven out That's the old nature part which is driven out because you can't birth that old nature Now where would you be you birth the old nature and you got as I said you know you got somebody in the honky tons or something and you got somebody out there living like the devil and then they get a new birth and the next day you see them and they're just out living like the devil that they was It didn't change anything Now something went wrong right we're old enough to realize something went wrong there cuz that's that's not right All right see that 500 brethren that he was seen of 380 of them and not saying they didn't come to it later but saying the point they did not go to the upper room to receive the Holy Ghost for some reason they were not ready for the Holy Ghost at that time maybe they received it later that's fine but they were not ready at that time All right And like I said if it's just some outpouring last Sunday I was trying to illustrate if it's just some outpouring of the Holy Spirit down upon mankind why wasn't they more than the 3,000 outside why was there not more than 120 why didn't theund When 120 get it why didn't the 3,000 get it right They didn't get it You had to go down there and preach to them later You see we're we're messing up our own thinking All right See you see then why I believe in the new birth is the birth of the word that you take into your being your soul You don't call it heart whatever you bringing it but you bringing it into the soul of mankind And then the Holy Ghost can come down and make that word alive that you've held or as a prophet would use it irrigate it You know the moisture that would be coming All right Then on the three cycles of mankind that we look at outside seat taste fields mel here the second realm you know memories and in the third part being the inner part See then the word would go through those outer senses into that inner sense of mankind and drive out that unclean spirit All right and then driving it out It would leave that inside man clean set aside Then the Holy Ghost can come back you know or come upon the individual and make that word alive All right but you see the anointed one which the Holy Spirit comes upon their spirit right it can't make the word alive that's not in there to be made alive So if they take some other idea or thought contrary to it how can the Lord make it alive right see then the new birth is the word made alive by the spirit of God where the Holy Ghost comes in and makes that word alive All right Now that's why I use the circles to show you and I believe it that the anointing can come down upon an individual and anoint their spirit with a genuine Holy Spirit but the prophet says they're still lost Now how come it can come down upon one person though and they get a new birth is God a respector of persons is that just another one of those thoughts of the seed that I come here with i'm asking you those questions Then if the new birth is and we'll get to this in the next message more for short that it is a revelation of the word is your new birth Then it means that word being revealed to you is that Holy Spirit quickening making alive that word that the disciples were holding until they got to the upper room That's supposed to be what it is in you and I So if we've never heard the word correctly preached I would wonder I had some people that asked me a question years ago said "I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ." I said "Well that's acceptable because it does say that." Technically the Bible does not say Lord Jesus Christ Brother Random put Lord Jesus Christ but that's what it does say because it said Lord over here and it said Jesus Christ over here But in Acts two there it says in the name of Jesus Christ And they said would you accept the baptism of just the name of Jesus Christ i said I'll ask you one question I said was that baptism in the name of Jesus Christ under regeneration and they knew that I knew what I talking about because the church they were in baptized under regeneration Even though it was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it was under regeneration believing that the water baptism saves you There are people who baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ That really they are believing water baptism under regeneration So I told the person that asked me that I said "I'm not telling you what you need to do I'm telling you what I'd do If I was in a church that believed water baptism under regeneration Well immediately upon hearing the word I would be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Again I'm honest That's is truthful Don't ask me a question if you don't want the answer I'll try my best to give you the I hope it's correct What would you do well that's okay You baptized the name Lord Lord Jesus Christ No but if you believe in that was under regeneration You're you're I don't I'm sorry And that's why a lot of people come to me and say "Brother Dale I really didn't know how I was baptized." My wife said she don't know how she was baptized because the guy that was baptizing her was brother Lickers and and him and brother Mike up in Gainesville and they were standing in the ice water and the ice was frozen to death and I had an overcoat and was standing on the bank with a hat on and I was freezing to death and we come up out of the water she had ice in her hair and everything but she said I said honey I believe I heard it correctly You know it's you know but think about it now We don't want to try to bypass things That's what I see in the Christian realm Maybe it's not the terminologies or the correct way of saying it but I see a lot of people trying to bypass because they they they don't want to go back and do something again you know to make sure they're right and they want to bypass it and and go on Well I'm just kind of like I was and I told it I was baptized father son holy ghost in a river over there at home I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in that same river We went over to Israel and uh I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the River Jordan And if I went to Mara I go back again and I get baptized again Well you don't believe what you done was right No no no no no I just fact you know I just won't I enjoy doing it you know and I do it again right see it doesn't show how super religious I am to deny anything Sometimes it shows the wrong thing All right But now before I go back through the statement that I've made before and made it Sunday I want to express something to you Have you noticed in the scriptures we read today that it says you were sealed by the Holy Spirit sealed by the Holy Spirit the prophet and expressing it "If you'd like these be glad to find." He said "He's sealed out and you're sealed in." Well then is the seal inside or is it on outside it's supposed to be made manifest through the spirit and the body as to what the seal is Am I right amen And he's supposed to really be sealed out of the body and spirit as far as God is concerned But we know that that doesn't maybe do it all the time because he still has those inroads but it's sealed out Grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed And it says here as we read the scripture that it talks about seemingly looking and see watch it go into another stage another stage In whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth That's right The gospel of your salvation In whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise That's right Right Have you ever been sealed by the Holy Spirit that's the question Do you really know that you've been sealed in and he's sealed out you remember a few weeks ago we were bringing the statements of what where the prophet said you know the devil He said no Said you went out to him He said he can't get into where you're at Said because he'd have to be justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost to get where you're at All right So then the Holy Spirit is a seal unto us See what I want us to get to of thinking one day Doesn't it make you little maybe think sometime of the statements brother Brandon will make he'll say it's you and God together as persons That's one statement And he'll say God come into you and you're dead and gone all kind of statements that am I the only one that is so carnal that when I run across those things I say what's he getting at you know what is he trying to say might find some secret nuggets laying there once you really see how those things transpire how that he would say you're I conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body and at other times he'll say the born again experiences the new birth and you can't be born again without the Holy Ghost coming in in you see does God come down and live in you as another person contrary to you as a person or does he come into you and make your make you eternal see maybe we're missing the new birth on that point that we're not seeing that he he comes down and anoints the word that we have heard Then you the devil can't come along and say "Well I know you say you got the baptism but said here the prophet said you can have the baptism all every day of your life and go to hell." Y'all wasn't around in the early days when we didn't have all the quotes and didn't have all of the messages and things you know to be able to check something with And I remember when that was really hammered pretty heavy by preachers because you could say anything and they say "Brother Brandon said you be baptized in the Holy Ghost every day of your life die and go to hell." See there you can be saved and lost I said he didn't say that That's right He didn't say you can be saved and lost He says you can't be saved and lost if you're really truly saved Now if you're pretending saving you're still lost anyway right but see then we were able to come along and get some quotes to where he says that that's upon your spirit All right that satisfied a lot But to just understand that was not the satisfaction that I needed because remember I'm supposed to be a minister and I'm supposed to try to answer your questions and your thoughts to help you All right the husbandman must be first partaker of the fruit So then I try to understand something before I preach on it As brother Brandham said he said "I I would not preach on what was it hell that time." He said "I wouldn't preach on it for a long time I forgot how many years." He said "Because I didn't understand it." All right I was in the message in 1967 And it was 1973 that I finally got around to preach on on uh Daniel 70 weeks cuz I didn't understand it But then when I got it to the basis that I could understand it I know cuz brother Mo was a pastor and I would not preach anything contrary to him and he knew I was studying on it and he said "Preach it." I said "No what if it's contrary to you?" I said "I won't do it because I said that that would be wrong I I may be your assistant but you're the pastor Cuz I've honored that Always have All right And uh so he said it like this and he got up in the pulpit and he said "Brother Dale is going to preach on Daniel 70 weeks." And said "We'll listen to him and wait and see what he's got." And said "When it's finished then we'll decide whether the thoughts are right or whatever it is." And I appreciated that because he left it open and I could speak what I believed All right And see then that way you know because I'm not I'm not going to be contrary That's why I've tried to my best to tell these ministers I've had a couple of situations that problem I said don't get in the pull pit and preach something contrary to what I preach until you first tell me and then when you tell me I'll decide whether or not you can go to the you know before the ser I said "You ought to have that much respect I would respect you." Or I'd get out and leave one because that's just I think that's the way we ought to be You know we ought to honor the things and see then that wouldn't wouldn't be no problem because if Wade come to me today and he said "Daddy I'm I I believe something contrary to you." I'd say "All right let's sit down and talk about it." If I seen it was worthy you know what I'd do and say the pull pit's yours to explain it But I would explain to the congregation Wade is going to preach something that is contrary to me of what I believe But I want you to listen to him very sincerely and I will be too And let's let the Holy Spirit decide of what it is You say "Would you do that to somebody?" I've done it before so I don't have to answer that question But now listen That Holy Spirit that irrigates that word you held in your soul does more than just make it alive It seals that it seals that soul Brother R said now it's like a woman getting pregnant He said she can't get pregnant again cuz she's sealed up Right All right And see then that's what it ought to be We ought to look at the new birth as to see and then when somebody comes along with something different just check it out with that new birth that you have and see if it'll go from here through here and out here There's some of them you know what I'm talking about There's some of them think that the great revelation when you get up here that polygamy is okay Now that's in the message people Oh yeah Even a good Baptist wouldn't believe it that way He just kind of bypass it and goes on forgets it At least some of them are still fighting against those things All right But listen see then you are sealed let me I didn't give him this but let me I was just sitting there thinking about it and uh look what brother Brandham says on the message called what shall I do with Jesus called to Christ preaching 63 11:24 that morning service paragraph 104 now the Holy Spirit is the God is not three He's the same God in three dispensations I want you Same God in three dispensations All right Three offices God the Father over the law God the Son in grace and God the Holy Ghost as you call Pulled it up And look what he says God the Father was the word That's where we got down to reading God the Son was the word God the Holy Ghost is the word Remember it's the same God Three disciplines say not three different gods Oh we want to make it father son and holy ghost It's father son holy ghost is the same God all the way All right Watch what he says It's just three offices and and the Holy Ghost seals you Therefore you're sealed by the word The new birth is a birth of the word And that's what seals you right seals you in Christ Think about it being sealed by the word Do you know what that merely means if you think about it it means you can't pregnantate that thing any different now I mean can somebody come along now and tell you the trinity is is right Come on Can they deprogram you and put you somewhere and give you a million-dollar airplane to fly the country with to get you to preach their doctrine and to try to tell the world that you was wrong in trying to believe the prophet's message come on Don't tell me you got the Holy Ghost Forget all that junk All right See then you're sealed by the Holy Spirit And the Holy Spirit is that seal upon the [Music] word that you've taken and you believe it That's what the disciples said We don't know where to go Thou has the words of eternal life Where can we go that's right you know we don't have nowhere to go We don't know what's going on We certainly don't know what's happening but we ain't going to go nowhere else He said "You're just in good shape." Now go up to the upper room sit up there and wait a while Now you remember what Brother Brham emphasized that He said one of them said one day he said "Let's just take it by faith We've got the gifts We've seen the dead raised We've seen all of these things Let's just go by faith." That's a good thing ain't it oh glory Hallelujah We've got it by faith It's all right if it's real But what about now the new birth being the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you the word that was revealed to you see the alive word seals you into the body Would you want to read that they can surely pull it up in a hurry Paragraph 233 and 234 of Christ is a mystery of God revealed because that's what we were on last week Go to paragraph 240 and he says the new birth is a revelation Remember on Patmas vision paragraph 71 1960 1204 you can't be saved until it's revealed to you You're only saved by revelation Remember in the message called the rapture paragraph 66 that a revelation is faith So he can only be born again by faith Faith is a revelation You can only be born again by revelation We'll pick this up in the next message and drop back over on it because the last one they can pull that one up which is paragraph 28 Earnestly contending for the faith Number five brothers a personal experience Have you had a personal experience and watch There's quite a difference in me having an intellectual faith than a divine faith That's where you my Baptist friends fail to go on You get the intellectual faith by that But it must be a divine revelation of Jesus Christ to you that just came out of the heart All right Am I still with the thought are you with it where's the intellectual faith where's divine faith heart What's heart oh what happened in the garden satan took the what the head God took the heart Right Okay The in effect in intellectual faith is not enough That's all right But it only brings you to the Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit is a personal experience of the birth the new birth regeneration making a new creature in Christ All right has it been revealed to you that you're born again will what ever came to you as your thoughts about a new birth will it compare with the rest of the word you know the Bible don't say he that believes I knew that in the Baptist church and used to talk to them a little bit about it The Bible said "He that believeth," which is a continuation if you stop believing then there's something wrong with you believing Right but he that believeth and is baptized The Bible says "Being born again?" By the what by the incorruptible word of God that liveth and abideth forever Amen Have you have you ever asked God to reveal to you the new birth no I'm not going to do that brother Dale Cuz that mean to say I didn't believe I already had it And you did you finally get what I've been preaching the whole day cuz that's the point the whole day right okay Is that the you know that's the whole point of the whole message is is is to try to get us away from that intellectual faith See now intellectual faith will deny the word somewhere It has to to be intellectual faith It can't Intellectual faith can't bring the word word by word But divine revelation can fit all the way And remember my point to start with is whatever you started with to get the new birth is the same thing that's going to take you on to the change of the body Amen To take you out of here And then you want you know what you can say then hey we'll be going up in the air and you can look over at me and you can say "Brother Dale thank you Because you tried to explain this to us didn't you?" Said "Cuz you know what now I know I've got the new birth." Because I've just changed and we're heading out of here You say "Thank you." Well it may take till then before you get over your petty feelings about me and hurt little feelings about something that I try to say to you you know but that's all right when we get up there we don't have to worry about none of that That's right But I want to express one more time and then I'll do it again Lord willing next Sunday One more thing You're not born again your body You're not born again in your body You're not born again in your spirit You're born again in your soul Justification sanctification baptism of holy takes place in the soul The soul the new birth is a birth of the word The word you've heard you took it you held it and hold on to it Holy Spirit comes and quickens it uh seals you into the kingdom All right Then does the Holy Spirit have to come into your soul for you to think that you're saved as the prophet would say you and God are together in persons Does that mean there's two people standing inside of me why can't you just simply say it like this that God came down and made alive the word that he had given me That's right And that makes you and him as one together Amen Why can't you believe it that way amen Well you're doing away with the I done away with the Holy Spirit I still believe the Holy Spirit has to come down That's right I I me am still looking this headstone when it unites for the body May I quote the prophet that will come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that it'll fill every fiber of your being and take in the rapture Sir is that what he said so Brother Dale are you still looking for the baptism i'm looking every day But I know one thing for certain If the word ain't right why do you think we've been here 40 something years you don't never think that way That means something's wrong with what we've got planted That's right We planted our own ideas the prophet brought the word unto us pure and unadulterated He said and that's where a lot of people say well I believe him after the seals broke I don't believe him before the seals broke Well now before the seals broke was when he said and spoken word the seed that the word had been pronulated See the word that was in this Bible 1962 You read spoken words read no seed over and over and you'll finally one day realize he's talking about the word pure and unadulterated was exactly the way the disciples brought it He said "How many gods they have?" One How many gods the bride have one But those seals and things were things that never been spoken on And that was his message to be brought So the Holy Spirit comes down upon you as a baptism Don't ever say that brother Dale says that he doesn't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost You're you're a lying because I believe in it I've witnessed them I don't have to worry about it But I try to explain it to you and I know it's hard for the human mind to have always been taught well we going to get the baptism We got the baptism We got the baptism It's everybody with the baptism Baptism Baptism Then you ask them about the baptism Well well the baptism is speaking in tong shouting glory I don't believe that Now I don't believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost is shouting speaking in tongues Do I believe the baptism is the birth and I believe you are doing a lot to do with that crying and speaking in tongues and thing is working out through your body Okay So now take you to the three circles The Holy Spirit can anoint your body do great things He can anoint your spirit do great wonderful things But does he anoint the soul or does he seal the soul does he irrigate the soul does he give birth to the soul those are words maybe we'd not place within our vocabulary about it We've only used the baptism But see you can't tie together then the rest of the prophet's message And when he gets over on the I'm pretty sure it's right at the last of the seventh seal he said go on with the same simple message He said because you don't said you'll work yourself away I'm paraphrasing but it's pretty close He said you'll work yourself away from it In other words let God lead us and go on Right now let me illustrate it in one more way I'll take this up next service again so it won't work Did Luther have the new birth i thought the prophet emphasized and done a whole message in the church age book on it's called the Holy Ghost and ever age and I thought he brought it out that the Holy Ghost has been in ever age and I I think and can believe that he's talking about the new birth in every age Because may I quote the scripture to you if Luther didn't get the word planted as Jesus spoke and held the word as Jesus spoke and the Holy Ghost come and quickened that to Luther then there was no way he could have the new birth Are you going to leave him out of this then you're going to say it's not the Holy Ghost in our age See where our trouble is is a lot of the quotes brother Brandham is referring to there will be things that he says in there that it seems like that this age don't have it this age does have it and this age gets a little more of it Well maybe this will explain to you what I'm thinking about Martin Luther was a Catholic and he believed in his Catholicism that that was his birth God come along and there was a lot of people protesting the Catholic Church before Martin Luther started I kind of believe Luther was kind of up in that ranks Don't you i don't believe he was just one of them fly by night sitting over there and kissing the pope's toe and popes towing Everything was okey dokie I think he was a human being was that God was beginning to deal with throughout his life That's me now And then God come down one day and says "The just shall live by faith." That was not his first contact with God as a a birth form or thoughts or ideas He was already a believer And here's where we miss the prophet He'll say the birth of the age Luther's age was the age of justification But he as an individual had the new birth You can argue and try to decree all you want to and fuss up and down about it that Luther didn't have it like we have it The quotes are there that brother Random said he didn't have it in the magnitude or something to the order that we have it today But you know what he got it If he wasn't born again he's not in the body of Christ All right so you're going to leave a gap in your pyramid You know you're going to you're really smart You got it all figured out It wasn't long until a man came along by the name of John Wesley You know that John Wesley believed in the new birth of justification He thought he was saved He was already a preacher He was a missionary on his way to America and he received the message of sanctification from the moral or how you pronounce the word But yet they didn't do with that message that what Wesley did So it became the age of sanctification Not that Wesley wasn't born again If he hadn't been born again he wouldn't have come to the truth of it Okay wasn't long after then a group of people called Isusa Street Pentecost You got in there with those pilgrim holiness Listen to Prophet the other day He says "Oh good old sanctified Methodist." He said "That's all they were." Talking about your pilgrim holiness and your your congregational holy everyone He put them all in there where he's at You know that he said "Good old sanctified Methodist." You know a lot of them turned down the gifts and the things right but you know what the oneeyed black man on Isusa Street was not the first one to speaking in tongues and trying to get the gifts moving etc etc They already were a lot of people doing that but he was the one that struck in the age of the gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost Now here's where the people of the message even deny Brother Brandham calls the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Isusa Street the same baptism in the book of Acts Now you tell me that ain't right I'll be glad to bring you the quotes He said I met people 50 years before I come along that had the same Holy Ghost that come on the day of Pentecost Amen But you see where the problem is they can't divide the day of Pentecost I know that's where I come along and I just stir up the whole deal because the 120 in the upper room had walked with Jesus for three and a half years And when the Holy Ghost fell on them it could bring them to right here where it says Holy Spirit not the headstone because your prophet said it hasn't come So forget it Right but that 3,000 born outside was born again right down here because they'd never heard the word and they was born again at faith So those on Isusa street was born again in faith 464 the old seal book Read it And under that when he says he calls street he said another great prophet Well well that's brother No he says then as all the other ages at the end of the age the messenger comes because the Holy Ghost come on Isusa street there is your prophet but it's the age of the word you're talking about Amen Brother Brandham swallow this Let's see Brother Brandham then was born again under the Isusa Street Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost Now come on You tell me anything different I'm subject to listening But where you going to put it he received the Holy Ghost way back in his early time life It was the same Holy Ghost that come on day at Pentecost Now then what happened then the message came and you want to quote like in rapture etc where he says the message began in the seals not in the years of preparation Brother Random's message was not from from 47 to 62 That was restoring of the faith back to the original Pentecostal fathers that was in this Bible Then his message came If you want the quotes I'd be glad to give them to you where the message started with the opening of those seals Now in the days of Luther the man and the message man and the age became one Age of justification Luther come right in there with it You know what for you to not believe Luther's message You was not in the age of Luther and you was not in the baptism of the Holy Ghost Luther had move it on up to Wesley Move it up to Wesley Wesley and message of sanctification became one because of the age of sanctification And for you to deny Wesley's message became Luther's message Where did it leave you you were not in the age of Wesley I ain't going to say they wouldn't saved Ain't got nothing to do with it Trying to express something When you come to Isusa Street the Holy Ghost and those people became one For you to stay in the age of sanctification and refuse to go on am I quoting the prophet you denominate and die But those who came on was not just gifts Do you realize on Isusa Street that they were trinitarians you realize before brother Random ever started in about 1914 111 or somewhere in there that Seymour and all of those brothers begin to preach on the oneness of the Godhead Brother Brandham wasn't the first one that preached on the oneness of the Godhead He he was the first one got it straight and right Yeah I agree there Now we'll hold on to that But they'd even started baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before Brother Brandom ever started What's your point brother Dale brother Brandham and his message become one He had the new birth He come with his message Somebody Can you say as I quoted this morning the new birth or message of the age you see if we stay in Isusa Street and won't go on to the message that Brother Brandham brought we can prove that we're lost You know somebody's got to give birth to this message Right The world wasn't concerned The pope didn't get upset when Martin Luther protested the Catholic Church He didn't get no problems He didn't go haywire and have all kind of headaches And I when he posted that thesis on the door it was when the people begin to follow Luther's message the devil got concerned When the people started believing Wesley's message he the devil got concerned When they started believing the Zeus Street message the devil got concerned If you want to see the devil get upset just start believing this message Amen Get away from all the fanaticism all of these two souls seven thunder virtues peruses son of man all of that polygamies and biggamies and higgamies and whatever thing and start believing the prophet's message The devil will get upset at you So if you want the devil upset at you just start believing the message Now if you don't want the devil upset at you just just sit there in your little seats and be happy But remember you're going by the grave That's right Right Would you believe it if I read something to you let's see if I can find it Come ahead brothers Come ahead musicians Oh yeah There's a man here that can turn on the lights Paragraph 187 pre 63 1229 Justification served its time in justification under Luther Then it had to become sanctification through Wesley And sanctification served its time till it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost And the baptism of the Holy Ghost served its time until the Holy Spirit which there's only one God blends into the church and the church into Christ And it makes Jesus Christ reflected on earth what he promised here in the Bible Might not believe it I can't make you do that I'm only responsible for the word That's what your prophet had to say Folks you can see why did I feel so But in 1969 trying to preach to a group of people that the bride of Jesus Christ quoting from the prophet would be the son of man in the last days No that's just brother Brandham Go ahead We will remind you that we're reading in Revelations 5 of Revelations 1 And this one in Revelations 1 Brother Brandham said is the bride And it says in the midst of the seven golden counts kind of one like unto the son of man That's the bride That's God in bride form You see do we believe it then what do we got let's do four in the red book Amen Amen Think on these things We've got something to do in our day This I know Just become the word Thank God for hearing by the word just become the word ones to him belong They are weak but he is strong Yes Jesus loves me Yes Jesus loves me Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so Jesus loves me He who died heaven gates to open wide He will wash away What about it do you have that new birth has it been revealed to you that you're a child of God yes Jesus loves me
