[0:04] it's recording good morning good morning
[0:08] morning morning morning morning good
[0:11] morning we only have one Tech and
[0:13] brother Bob's upstairs and brother way
[0:15] doesn't laid it right there on the
[0:18] table no I didn't I laid it on the table
[0:23] in before before I start I want to I
[0:26] want to continue my thought that I was
[0:27] on last time on uh
[0:34] signs and prophecies at the end time
[0:37] it's been on the news for I don't know
[0:39] since last week that shooting in
[0:42] Connecticut they shot 20 kids and six
[0:45] adults and the youngest was 6 years
[0:49] old but uh there has been killing since
[0:53] uh since the beginning of time when Cain
[0:55] slew his brother
[0:58] right and there's only two Spirits in a
[1:00] world that's God's spirit and the devil
[1:03] so God put us on free moral
[1:06] agency uh Joshua josua said Joshua said
[1:10] choose you this day Who You Shall
[1:13] Serve but as for me and my house We
[1:15] Shall Serve the
[1:18] Lord but uh the devil is still trying to
[1:21] kill us but he can't unless God lets him
[1:25] just like job he told the devil that he
[1:29] consider to my servant job and he said
[1:31] well you got a edge around him he said
[1:34] well go ahead go ahead but don't touch
[1:38] his life but uh that doesn't mean we
[1:40] don't have to go through trials
[1:43] and and tribulations just like
[1:47] uh just like brother Danny what he had
[1:49] to go through you know so maybe we had
[1:51] to change his name to Jo
[1:56] I okay let's read our first scripture
[2:01] Daniel
[2:10] 124 but old Daniel shut up the words and
[2:13] sealed the book even to the time of the
[2:16] end many shall run to and fr and
[2:18] knowledge shall
[2:20] increase last time I was talking about
[2:23] cars with no drivers and pilots and
[2:26] airplanes with no pilots on them and uh
[2:29] I'm have to be looking for a job because
[2:31] they going to have big
[2:34] trucks but
[2:38] uh when uh when we got out here I was
[2:41] showing
[2:42] um all the pictures of the airplanes and
[2:45] the in the cars and he said they also
[2:48] have uh cars that fly and uh skateboards
[2:53] that hover so maybe he should be
[2:58] here
[3:02] okay let's read that other scripture
[3:03] which is my main topic that I want to
[3:05] talk about uh
[3:07] Matthew
[3:10] 12 12 verse
[3:22] 38-41
[3:24] 12:38 then certain other the scribes and
[3:27] other the Pharisees answered saying
[3:29] master will see a sign from theee but he
[3:32] answered and said unto them an evil and
[3:35] adulterous generation seek after sign
[3:38] and there shall no sign be given to it
[3:41] but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as
[3:44] Jonas was three days and three nights in
[3:47] the Well's Valley shall shall the son of
[3:50] man be three days and three nights in
[3:51] the heart of the earth and said the man
[3:55] in N shall rise in Judgment of this
[3:57] generation shall condemn it because
[4:00] they repented at the preaching of Jonah
[4:02] and behold a greater than Jonah is
[4:09] here and what was the sign that was a
[4:12] sign of the
[4:13] restoration Jesus Christ resur
[4:16] Resurrection in US it has to be from the
[4:19] inside that's so I still have to talk
[4:22] about signs even though we know what it
[4:24] is you know because like I said
[4:25] everybody's looking for sign
[4:28] right
[4:30] in the message
[4:32] uh a true sign that Overlook brother
[4:38] said he said how strangely that man will
[4:40] do that that we look for a sign when a
[4:43] sign right with them right among them
[4:46] now Israel had got into that condition
[4:49] and sometimes that torture that the sign
[4:52] has to go through is amazing the torture
[4:55] that Jesus went through to prove the
[4:58] sign of God that he was the
[5:02] Messiah now we fin out he this young
[5:04] Prophet by the name Ezekiel constantly
[5:07] became a sign all the time how he tort
[5:10] to himself one place we find that where
[5:13] he laid on his left side for 390 days
[5:18] God told him to get some beans and some
[5:21] pottage put it all together and cook it
[5:23] up and lay it down by his side and go
[5:26] lay on a towel and lay on his left side
[5:29] alone not turn over for 390 days well I
[5:33] couldn't do that think of it and that
[5:36] said turn over on that right side and
[5:38] lay there 40 days again and he said here
[5:43] what you see Ezekiel said because you're
[5:45] bearing the iniquity of the people each
[5:48] day will account a year for them being
[5:53] that every day he laid there that meant
[5:55] a year that be there'll be in captivity
[5:58] and that their iniquities would be
[6:01] remembered MH to God and God would not
[6:04] hear their prayers no more but the
[6:07] torture that that man had to go through
[6:10] why would that be necessary man has
[6:13] wonder why would such a thing be
[6:15] necessary for a man to do that is
[6:17] because that people won't read the word
[6:21] and they won't pray so God is Sovereign
[6:24] and he sends his Prophet to be a sign
[6:27] the people won't read they don't care to
[6:29] read they won't pray because they're
[6:32] they got other things to do they can't
[6:35] take time to pray and they B Bible is
[6:38] boresome to them hasn't got enough
[6:40] action for those modern days or any
[6:43] other
[6:44] day brother B says he he spends about 10
[6:47] hours just for half hour to do this with
[6:50] I don't do it as much so little by
[6:52] little the Lord gives me something and
[6:54] then I you know but like I say I feel
[6:58] sorry for then they have to do
[7:09] say later year that coming out age that
[7:11] was Moses that Prophet that was God
[7:14] signed to Israel they had been for 100
[7:16] years in bondage and God prepared a sign
[7:19] for them just before deliverance and he
[7:22] was a sign of Deliverance to Israel and
[7:24] a sign a judgment to
[7:27] Egypt now now no was a sign of
[7:30] Deliverance to his people and a sign of
[7:32] judgment to the Lost World an unbeliever
[7:35] the very Waters that choked the world
[7:37] and drown the world was the only means
[7:39] of saving Noah and the only thing that
[7:42] could save him was
[7:44] judgment and the only thing that will
[7:46] save the church today is
[7:48] Judgment God lay the judgment to the pl
[7:51] but Noah preached the same he became a
[7:56] sign God only sends his prophet when the
[7:59] people wants a prophet God sends a sign
[8:02] when the people are ready for a sign but
[8:05] the thing is that people sell them they
[8:08] get to a place that they don't want that
[8:11] they want emotion they want some show us
[8:14] a sign from heaven like the Pharisees
[8:16] sign from here you already got a sign
[8:19] but when God sends a sign they don't
[8:21] want to see it so it's hid from the eyes
[8:23] of the wise and prudent and revealed to
[8:26] the babes that will
[8:28] learn
[8:37] Jesus warned us the last day that what
[8:39] would happen but a true servant a true
[8:41] Prophet never fails to stay right with
[8:44] th said the Lord he said Moses stay with
[8:48] the Lord he was a sign he was a sign to
[8:50] Israel that their day of Deliverance was
[8:52] at hand and he was assigned to Egypt
[8:55] that the day of the end was at hand cuz
[8:58] they drowned out there in that Dead Sea
[9:00] later the whole Army of pharaoh they
[9:03] were at the end of their military power
[9:06] a prophet was a sign of a national
[9:11] end he said think of it how great God is
[9:14] and what Simplicity he works in surely
[9:17] if he the UN educator can understand it
[9:21] the educator should if the slaves
[9:24] the slum pits of Egypt could understand
[9:28] that that that was a prophet from God
[9:31] and the hour was at hand how much more
[9:33] ought the pharaoh's Palace to know it
[9:36] but that's a kind that doesn't know it
[9:38] that's a kind that misses it always and
[9:42] that Moses stood looking through those
[9:44] windows that those children Israel
[9:47] passing by to Israel to Pharaoh they
[9:51] were slaves and dogs but to Moses they
[9:54] were the elected of God the Bible said
[9:58] that Moses chose
[9:59] made his own choosing to suffer the
[10:01] reproach of Christ esteeming it Greater
[10:05] riches than the pleasure of sin for he
[10:07] had recompensed unto the reward Moses
[10:11] knew that at them wasn't m d there were
[10:16] people with a
[10:17] promise himself he knew who he was he he
[10:22] could couldn't tell them they got to
[10:25] recognize it themselves he knew himself
[10:27] what his work was to be done he knew
[10:30] that God had raised him up for this
[10:32] purpose but he couldn't tell them as
[10:35] long as they were blind to it he never
[10:37] did Ral himself openly until they'll
[10:40] recogniz it then they seen that sign and
[10:43] they knew it he said I'll give Israel a
[10:46] sign take this stick turn it into a
[10:48] snake if they won't listen to that then
[10:51] put your hand on your booom pull it out
[10:54] heal yourself of leprosy then believe it
[10:57] and then if they won't hear it take
[10:58] water of the now down there pour on the
[11:02] dry land all the waters will become
[11:04] blood that was a national sign the
[11:07] people will believe it when the people
[11:10] will believe it when them that's ready
[11:13] to receive it it will believe it when
[11:16] they see the sign of God moving but the
[11:18] nation has to have something different
[11:20] so he gave them all a
[11:27] sign
[11:33] yeah he he preached different message on
[11:35] on signs you know like
[11:38] uh signs and prophecies Junction of time
[11:42] Junction of time and so I guess maybe
[11:45] that's why he's called the end time
[11:46] Messenger to give us a sign that's right
[11:49] absolutely that's
[11:51] it that's right Elijah was a signed in
[11:55] his day the Prophet Elijah to the to the
[11:59] he was a sign of God's word judgment to
[12:02] Egypt and deliverance to Israel if they
[12:04] wanted to believe him in that sinful day
[12:07] of Elijah when is all Israel went back
[12:11] to went back on God they gone back to
[12:13] sin they forgot the order they forgot
[12:16] about being led out by God and the great
[12:19] Jehovah they opened the Red Sea and
[12:21] brought them out of uh out of
[12:26] Egypt and how that Elijah stood there
[12:29] both thus said the Lord oh God give us a
[12:32] man like that he wasn't afraid to tell
[12:34] Jezebel about her condition he wasn't
[12:36] scared of Ahab he wasn't afraid that he
[12:39] was mistaken he stood with boldness and
[12:43] walked up to Ahab and said not even do
[12:46] will fall till I call for it what was he
[12:49] a signed to that sinful generation
[12:52] Israel did Israel see it no they laughed
[12:55] at him make fun of him he predicted
[12:58] there will be a rought that would be
[13:00] there there would be trouble hunger
[13:03] starvation and he prophesied boldly
[13:05] standing by himself was thus said the
[13:08] Lord they kill they kill all the true of
[13:12] them they killed them all I'm the only
[13:16] ones left that's standing with your word
[13:19] what was the trouble about the word of
[13:22] God Elijah wanted to stay with the word
[13:24] he was a real Prophet other prophets had
[13:27] said oh well it doesn't make much
[13:30] difference Jehovah doesn't care you know
[13:33] Jehovah does care it's got to be his
[13:35] word Elijah stood boldly on that word
[13:38] with thou said the Lord God have him God
[13:41] gave him a secret one day he said I got
[13:44] seven I got 7,000 L that you witness to
[13:48] out there they haven't got that nerve
[13:50] enough to come up and claim it they're
[13:53] hiding around the bushes but yet in
[13:55] their heart they're my servants they
[13:58] they have a need to bail they're afraid
[14:01] to do it but I'm giving you a sign and
[14:03] you're a sign he say stand out there on
[14:07] my word I'll take care of you give them
[14:09] a sign
[14:10] Allelujah God sends us something like
[14:13] that who will be a sign of God's word
[14:16] and every promise god promise will be
[14:19] backed up in that person CU he's a
[14:22] sign a forgotten
[14:27] sign
[14:41] and the mess the junction of
[14:48] time he talks about dispensations and
[14:51] Junctions and corners
[14:54] and but you probably same thing
[15:01] he said always in the days gone by the
[15:04] dispensations has always come to their
[15:06] end and he said we hit a junction
[15:09] there's Junctions on the highway there's
[15:11] Junctions on the roads that we travel on
[15:14] this world there's Junction on this
[15:16] Grand Old Highway that we travel to
[15:19] Glory he said in my searching for the
[15:21] scriptures for quite a while I have
[15:23] found seven Great Junctions in God's
[15:26] word and seven is God's complete
[15:30] number we he completes in
[15:34] seven he worked six days and the Seven
[15:37] rested the world EX exist and his Reign
[15:41] Over the Earth here the church labors
[15:43] for 6,000 years and the Seven is the
[15:46] Millennium and all this
[15:49] mathematics of the Bible are
[15:55] perfect and we are believing that with
[15:57] all this great turmoil that we're living
[15:59] in today as we let look around on every
[16:02] hand and pick up the newspapers and just
[16:05] stand still and drop our everyday hustle
[16:08] and bustle of this neurotic age and look
[16:11] out and face fact we see Beyond in a
[16:14] shadow of a doubt that something just
[16:17] about to
[16:18] happen I'm kind of leaning on to getting
[16:20] on the Rapture maybe next week but uh
[16:23] I'm kind of you know like when we take a
[16:26] trip we have to get ready here before
[16:28] get we can't get up there with brother B
[16:31] we get ready here so so maybe next week
[16:35] talk about
[16:37] that the junction God always before this
[16:40] great Junction comes or ending of time
[16:44] where he starts something new Junctions
[16:47] with the old or to the new with one
[16:49] dispensation to another he always shows
[16:52] forth as Power Man Through the Ages
[16:54] always breaks down and teaches away and
[16:58] explain PLS away and gets away from the
[17:00] real living God but just before he
[17:03] Junctions enters a new dispensation he
[17:06] appears on the scene with great miracles
[17:08] signs and wonders he has always done it
[17:11] he said look at the first destruction of
[17:14] the world the first Junction after the
[17:17] world was formed and God placed man on
[17:19] Earth that the Bible said they began to
[17:21] build cities Great buildings programs
[17:24] went on in the world look at it today
[17:26] Jesus plainly said as he was in the day
[17:29] no no so shall be in the coming of the
[17:32] son of
[17:34] man he said and now notice again that
[17:37] not only that when all hell turns loose
[17:41] all Heaven turns loose also when the
[17:44] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[17:47] of God raises up standard against it and
[17:50] these two forces always show at the
[17:55] junction any comments where what m
[18:03] no go ahead huh go ahead
[18:07] okay and know is back there in that evil
[18:10] day just before the destruction when God
[18:12] had a man out preaching the gospel a
[18:14] poor man humble man not very much of the
[18:17] world but a man who had a heart to
[18:20] listen to God
[18:21] no now at the same time there was a Noah
[18:26] and Enoch preaching at the same time
[18:34] mhm he said how the day we live in a
[18:38] Junction Road at the end of the road the
[18:40] End of the Age God has proven it what a
[18:43] marvelous day to believe
[18:46] in oh God why can't Christians see
[18:50] blessed are they pure in heart they
[18:52] shall see God less are the meek they
[18:54] shall inherit the earth The Junction
[18:57] time is at and our
[18:59] father to to show that we're at the end
[19:02] time see the Miracles the supernatural
[19:05] the omnipotent doing the Miracles look
[19:08] at
[19:27] him events made clear about prophecy
[19:30] said now every time that the church gets
[19:32] mixed up in God for knew they would for
[19:34] he knew all things therefore has his
[19:37] certain Prophet ready for the age to
[19:40] cause is the leting by his Vindicated
[19:44] word of signs and wonders and confirming
[19:46] of his word confirming the word with
[19:49] signs following as he promised he gives
[19:51] the true interpretation after the
[19:54] prophet himself has been
[19:56] Vindicated all
[19:58] but those the elected to whom he is
[20:03] sent hate him now exam every instant and
[20:07] and see if that's right or not only the
[20:10] ones that he is sent to he came to his
[20:12] own and his own received him not but as
[20:15] many as he did receive to them gave him
[20:18] power to become sons of God notice every
[20:22] examination of the word in every instant
[20:24] and at the end of every age or climate
[20:28] or Junction I preached on it many times
[20:31] look at the age of Noah at the climax
[20:33] before judgment what happened Noah it
[20:36] was only his family they believe that
[20:39] men the rest of them criticized him and
[20:42] destroy the whole world in the days of
[20:45] Abraham only Abraham's group they
[20:47] believe when the angels went and
[20:49] preached to sod only lot and his wife
[20:52] and two daughters came out and she
[20:54] turned back to a pillar of
[20:57] salt
[21:13] uh we're at the letter of CH we had a
[21:17] prophet we had an end time message and
[21:20] last name we got a judgment if we we say
[21:22] we got oil in our lamps it's time to
[21:25] trim them get out of here m
[21:31] M I like that
[21:35] song the good old gospel ship it says
[21:38] I'm going to take a trip in the good old
[21:40] gospel ship I'm going far beyond the sky
[21:43] I'm going to shout and sing until the
[21:46] heavens ring when I'm bidding this world
[21:50] goodbye but before we do that like I
[21:53] said we have to get ready that's right
[21:55] everybody thinks of something that we
[21:57] need
[21:59] like when when you take a trip we have
[22:00] to pack a bag right so what are we going
[22:02] to what do we need to get ready here put
[22:05] in the bag before we get out of here and
