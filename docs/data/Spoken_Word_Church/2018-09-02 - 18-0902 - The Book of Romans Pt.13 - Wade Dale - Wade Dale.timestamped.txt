[0:21] let's see vitamin C coconut or something
[0:28] mara no oh I'm sorry let's have a little
[0:50] of freedom from you now same age okay
[1:01] alright so now let's get weird little
[1:04] skimpy today but that's okay alright
[1:08] Roman thing we started Romans 8:1 there
[1:14] is therefore now no condemnation for
[1:15] them in Christ Jesus who walk not after
[1:17] the flesh but after the spirit the
[1:20] blogosphere the life in Christ Jesus has
[1:21] made me free from the law of sin and
[1:23] death what the law could not do in that
[1:26] it was weak through the flesh God
[1:28] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:30] sinful flesh forced him condemned sin in
[1:33] the flesh that the righteousness of the
[1:36] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[1:38] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:40] now Paul says walk not after the flesh
[1:46] we have to walk in the flesh cuz we we
[1:49] are flashing on all right but yielding
[1:52] because you got to put some Scripture
[1:54] together what policy is yielding your
[1:56] members the things that would not I knew
[1:59] that now it wasn't it fall with the drop
[2:02] again the drinks everyone you know you
[2:04] understand this there's some things
[2:06] though that he does in his flesh that he
[2:08] doesn't like there's all things we do in
[2:12] our flesh we don't like right there
[2:15] taking up but it's not our flesh that
[2:17] doesn't it's the spirit realm which one
[2:20] does it is that motivator of this one
[2:22] does so don't get hung up where he says
[2:24] who walk not after the flesh but after
[2:27] the spirit you go into the indwelling
[2:30] man Bob study was good lacks not living
[2:35] the time it was wrong it was so we had a
[2:39] pretty good crowd big mover got a crowd
[2:41] one here we got a pretty good crowd but
[2:45] but you walk out of the spirit that
[2:48] spirit is the Holy Spirit inside your
[2:50] soul that's not a spirit realm like the
[2:53] memories and constant affection
[2:54] imagination because we walk not after
[2:57] the flesh but after the spirit for the
[3:00] thing that are after the flesh do mind
[3:02] the things of the flesh now listen we
[3:03] all mind think of the flesh we got it
[3:05] this morning then to eat we had drink
[3:06] because you go bathroom you know simple
[3:09] thing so Paul's not saying that he's not
[3:13] saying we for they that are after the
[3:16] flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[3:17] but they have the spirit things of the
[3:19] Spirit
[3:20] so we just you know we've we've seen the
[3:23] doctrines of sinless perfection and like
[3:27] free list oh my trying to stop the aging
[3:29] you know you just can't do that so but
[3:31] we do walk in the flesh but what does in
[3:35] our flesh there's what something
[3:38] worrying there's the spirit and the soul
[3:40] man warring with each other all right so
[3:44] that's where that is because look he
[3:47] brings it all the where it's at for it
[3:49] to be carnally in other words even safer
[3:53] to be flexible and you know to be
[3:55] carnally minded is that
[3:57] to the carnal mind is enmity because the
[4:02] carnal mind is enmity against God and
[4:03] with these divisions separation so
[4:06] that's what separated atoms from God is
[4:09] when the first thing out said we'll talk
[4:11] about it upstairs this afternoon
[4:13] we'll be touched on it last night about
[4:15] Saint had to air Yves will appear first
[4:18] this is the most important loomed of
[4:19] this act that happened afterwards was in
[4:23] the flesh but she had accepted in her
[4:27] spirit rent nourish all that's where you
[4:30] go and not in her soul she was eternal
[4:33] in soul because she added that the
[4:35] osmium that Genesis 1:26 man inside of
[4:37] her but that middle realm memory the
[4:40] conservation imagination Satan knew he
[4:43] could get to that and that's when he
[4:45] played on he didn't play on her flesh he
[4:49] got hurt what the womb of her mind the
[4:54] woman of her mind is the first thing
[4:56] Satan touched the same thing with you
[4:58] and I the woman of our mind is the first
[5:00] thing that Satan touches you right right
[5:03] for to be carnally minded is death but
[5:07] to be spiritually minded is life and
[5:09] peace because the carnal mind is enmity
[5:12] against God for it is not subject to the
[5:17] law of God neither indeed can be zero
[5:19] man what the world's going on here it's
[5:22] not subject to the law of God the law of
[5:24] God has nothing to do with your brain
[5:28] and the very men it's what's in there
[5:33] okay it's what's in there that motivates
[5:36] that i stinkin last night we were
[5:38] talking about revelation and the peter
[5:45] james and all them that were walked with
[5:48] Jesus you know and then they come to the
[5:50] face of the father's day the Holy Ghost
[5:52] quickened what they hell now the Holy
[5:54] Ghost quick and something in Peter maybe
[5:56] they didn't quickening James we're still
[5:58] individuals we're all individuals in the
[6:01] body of Christ I can't say because Bob
[6:04] came into message two years after I did
[6:06] he's two years behind me there's no such
[6:09] thing no such thing why because God
[6:13] doesn't work that way God can work in
[6:15] just a few hours what man is tried to
[6:18] work in
[6:19] even brother Graham told us you know he
[6:21] said God doing one year but theologist
[6:23] has tried to do in 2000 all right so
[6:26] that's what he's doing now I think he's
[6:28] he's causing us to number one and
[6:31] understand what we're doing here is who
[6:34] we are what we're doing here and that
[6:36] the evil thoughts we have in our mind
[6:40] hello did not come from the inward man
[6:44] the deep man it came from that law of
[6:49] the carnal mind that when Adam said I
[6:51] was afraid no fear they never entered
[6:56] into Adam before now remember he was the
[6:59] son of God yet he has no fear in his
[7:02] soul you have no fear control if you're
[7:03] born again if you're not born again it
[7:06] is fair period is fair all right for it
[7:10] is not so much the vlog on neither
[7:12] indeed can be all right so it cannot be
[7:15] subject to the law of God it's enmity it
[7:17] is totally contrary like I said before
[7:20] we must realize we are contrary to God
[7:25] when we go to sleep eat get a bit of
[7:29] things of life that's totally contrary
[7:31] to garden garden wants to be this way
[7:33] not this way right here no way you do
[7:35] not want us to come this way but we did
[7:38] so we must accept that and then let him
[7:40] work through it that's what Paul's
[7:41] telling us he said look be carnally
[7:44] minded the enmity against God but it's
[7:46] not sensible log-on neither they can be
[7:48] watched so then they are that in the
[7:51] flesh cannot please God in other words
[7:55] all the fleshly things that we did
[7:58] motivated by the spirit or not kind
[8:00] please God but you're not in the flesh
[8:04] but in the spirit if big word yes so be
[8:10] that the Spirit of God dwells in you now
[8:14] if any man have not the Spirit of Christ
[8:15] he is none of his
[8:17] what will come about last night with the
[8:18] adoption at all is violence
[8:26] now if any man have not the Spirit of
[8:27] Christ he is none of it and Christ being
[8:31] you of the body is dead but the sin we
[8:34] must realize that we must realize that
[8:42] your body is dead because of sin but the
[8:45] Spirit is life because the processes now
[8:48] Christ being in the body is dead we're
[8:50] dying suppose being real playing here
[8:54] uses look if you're in the flesh you're
[8:56] not but the spirit of life is life
[9:01] because the process does what this is
[9:03] his whole summation right here but if
[9:07] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[9:08] from the dead he just was dead the body
[9:11] was they had dwell in you he that raised
[9:15] up Christ from the dead shall also
[9:21] quicken your mortal bodies now he's
[9:25] coming down he's talking about flesh of
[9:28] their flesh that fresh fish fish fish
[9:29] flesh flesh you watch right here mortal
[9:33] body that's not what he was talking
[9:35] about up at the top
[9:36] sure he was how much a mortal body was
[9:38] telling something working through your
[9:39] warm body this is telling you right here
[9:42] if you have that same spirit that raised
[9:45] up Christ from the dead now what
[9:47] happened when that spirit come back into
[9:50] Jesus's body you clean it it made
[9:54] eternal right we don't see stuff maybe
[9:59] this afternoon maybe next Sunday there's
[10:02] one thing Jesus took with him that he
[10:05] didn't send back on with a pink on one
[10:08] thing everything else he sent back
[10:13] he did not send back the gourd my body
[10:16] he did not send back the body change he
[10:18] sent us the ability but he did not send
[10:21] us the body change back with him on that
[10:23] Pentecostal didn't know budging
[10:25] he sent the Son of God the spirit guide
[10:28] to burn their soul out but his soul in
[10:33] and them live a Christian life that's
[10:36] not what's going to happen to me unless
[10:42] you pass on the with which in the great
[10:43] we're going to come to a place to where
[10:46] that that same Jesus it's now here and
[10:50] in your body the Son of Man which is God
[10:53] in human flesh that's what we have at
[10:56] the end time Paula didn't even see that
[10:59] he saw it coming he knew the tail
[11:01] because right here he's telling you he
[11:03] that raised up Christ in the dish you're
[11:05] equipping your mortal body that he never
[11:06] saw that he's actually waiting in the
[11:09] sixth dimension for that mortal bodies
[11:14] by his Spirit that dwelleth in you
[11:16] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[11:19] the flesh to live after the flesh wife
[11:23] we live after the flesh you shall die
[11:26] but in either the spirit do mortify the
[11:30] deeds of the body you shall live in
[11:33] other words do I ain't like we'll come
[11:35] back you know getting rid of those
[11:36] things dead will read some scripture
[11:40] tonight or this afternoon original quote
[11:42] for brother Randall talked about being
[11:45] David but we're still on for sale which
[11:48] is called death for as many as are led
[11:51] by the Spirit of God they are the sons
[11:54] of God for ye have not received the
[11:57] spirit of bondage again to fear now see
[12:01] you didn't that's what you live under
[12:05] and his brother is upstairs but he sent
[12:08] me up you know that's right that's right
[12:11] that's what I was gonna be he sent me a
[12:16] message about that
[12:19] and make it pretty pretty full family
[12:23] have that little poets come along now
[12:28] that little boy to come up with all them
[12:30] kids running around
[12:31] he wrote simply profound brother wait
[12:35] I've really been enjoying this
[12:36] unnecessary notebook Romans one
[12:37] particular comment you may send you
[12:39] stroke me very profound I downloaded the
[12:42] audio but I've not went back to listen
[12:44] Frankie you say something about the
[12:45] reason we fear is because we don't know
[12:47] what will happen in our situation I
[12:49] thought about that and that is exactly
[12:51] true the whole reason I was so fearful
[12:54] about Ivan when she was so close to
[12:56] dying it's simply because I did not know
[12:59] that she was going to live
[13:00] I specifically remember thinking that
[13:03] the Lord would just give me some
[13:05] daughter scripture quote just some kind
[13:08] of comfort or consolation that you're
[13:10] going to be okay this you will not die I
[13:12] would have not been afraid no matter how
[13:14] much you got the only thing kept telling
[13:16] me the Lord kept telling me to do is not
[13:19] fear regardless of the outcome in every
[13:22] situation of life in which I was afraid
[13:25] it was because I did not know what the
[13:27] outcome would be right now one of them
[13:31] what what about would the Bible give us
[13:34] this to say fear not is telling us
[13:35] exactly what did not fear okay he knows
[13:40] every single situation I'm sorry that is
[13:44] what comforts me so much about knowing
[13:46] the Lord is that he knows every
[13:48] situation single situation that we're
[13:49] facing or will face and he knows exactly
[13:52] the outcome for that there can be no
[13:55] fear in him and should not be enough
[13:57] thank you so much really
[13:59] but that's true yes that's reasonably
[14:02] fair but if we have come to a place
[14:05] where the seal go put the where all the
[14:06] mysteries are open that we know where we
[14:09] came from what we're doing here where
[14:11] we're going
[14:11] where's the fear in that where's the
[14:15] fear in that where you going well I
[14:16] don't know where we're going yeah we
[14:18] come tell us what we go through whet
[14:20] their comeback notice about Lois how
[14:23] sublime annow wonderful it is even if
[14:25] you pass away right but then there's
[14:28] another level that one's not gonna pass
[14:30] away he told us about that day so we've
[14:34] not received a pair the bondage again to
[14:36] fear that's what Satan wants to do and
[14:39] that's what he does in the spirit realm
[14:41] he keeps giving you the negative right
[14:44] he keeps giving you the negative ones to
[14:47] go you know the negative part of what
[14:48] while you can't do this you can't do
[14:51] that just tell him that maybe he can but
[15:01] if I got this period want to raise the
[15:02] music from Daddy don't carry me through
[15:03] the whole thing but say next one takes
[15:06] the fear out of the way is if you know
[15:08] where you came from
[15:09] we know what happened we know that when
[15:11] predestinate we know that before the
[15:13] foundation of the world God knew we'd
[15:15] come to this place wrote the Bible and
[15:17] now we got it right here to read three
[15:21] different men telling us what happened
[15:25] like I said last night I was thinking
[15:27] this week don't give us this great big
[15:29] lovely and to read it on the surface it
[15:32] is really nice but we got a prophet
[15:35] coming and Eliezer that told us so much
[15:39] about me Isaac that when we stop that
[15:47] when Rebecca saw Isaac she didn't need a
[15:49] sheet of paper right she didn't need a
[15:53] checklist
[15:53] well is he now he said he was in he know
[15:57] she lived off that camel and they was
[15:59] probably hundreds of people in that
[16:01] field and there was Isaac Eliezer had
[16:03] told her so much about him
[16:05] now Ellie's are dead run over
[16:07] let me that's right three's a crowd
[16:14] well he's aren't even going to tell em
[16:16] either right but he did his job he told
[16:20] her what do you look like what his
[16:23] character was and what he would do
[16:25] because he's over the whole time he told
[16:27] her it everything right and then she did
[16:32] something remember she did something
[16:35] single herself out maybe we'll get it a
[16:36] little bit later like them but she
[16:39] absolutely we have absolutely did now
[16:42] remember now listen to this so you put
[16:45] that into our situation Rebecca once
[16:49] leds are told so much about them about
[16:51] Isaac to Rebecca do you think she was
[16:54] afraid I wonder what he's gonna know she
[16:57] don't know affect him and she said he
[17:01] either has told me so much about you I
[17:03] feel like I'm not knowing you forever
[17:05] well that's the same way with with God
[17:11] we were lost we know that but we were
[17:14] always and always in the mind of God
[17:15] always in a month all right what do we
[17:20] do we come down here to develop the
[17:22] picture the Prophet said we come down
[17:24] here to develop the picture prove the
[17:26] same they got it's true that he knew us
[17:31] before the foundation of the world knew
[17:33] we'd be here and know where we're going
[17:34] so where is the fear the fear that we
[17:36] have is it like we were talking the
[17:38] other week if we don't know the outcome
[17:40] of things that's the whole thing make
[17:42] Spears we just don't know the outcome of
[17:44] thing but when you hone it down to a
[17:47] Christian life we don't know the outcome
[17:49] we just have got to believe what the
[17:50] outcome already is because LEDs are
[17:56] didn't write a new chapter about Isaac
[18:01] he told her what he already knew about
[18:05] okay he didn't write a whole so so
[18:09] brother Graham did come to write a book
[18:10] to write
[18:12] right a Bible but he did write 1,100
[18:16] commentaries of what Isaac meant to him
[18:21] and means to us okay so that's the way
[18:23] it is the way I read it the way you
[18:25] should read it it's the level liquor
[18:27] part even in the Old Testament I've been
[18:31] reading in Ezekiel man go back to read
[18:32] Ezekiel again as easily get fall of
[18:36] little nuggets that means something to
[18:39] us you know you show us a Old Testament
[18:42] they were given for our example all
[18:45] right
[18:45] Isaiah Ezekiel some of those went down
[18:48] for we have not received the spirit of
[18:51] bondage again to fear how in the world
[18:54] can you be born again and been bodies
[18:56] now the only bondage were in is step
[18:58] back out to them to the next cubicle we
[19:00] were taught last night to the next box
[19:02] the memories unconscious that's where
[19:04] the fear is there's no fear in your new
[19:08] birth because there's no fearing died
[19:10] and died in your soul there's no fear
[19:13] later so where's the fear the fear is in
[19:15] that filter in between Satan out here
[19:18] talking to you and God in here
[19:20] competition okay there's where the fear
[19:23] is for we have not received the spirit
[19:25] excuse me the spirit of bondage again to
[19:27] fear but we have received the spirit of
[19:31] adoption now that's what we're talking
[19:32] about last night we received the spirit
[19:34] of adoption
[19:35] now we're not adopted totally given the
[19:38] key given the checkbook when we first
[19:41] morning in know we're a new spirit babe
[19:46] in Christ a baby right and we then what
[19:52] grow up but look you got to be adopted
[19:55] into the family remember I read that and
[19:57] I'll pull it back up and we'll run it
[19:58] off where the commentator that's just
[20:02] not even the message this is just a
[20:03] commentator from our comments from a man
[20:07] that wrote a article about adoption
[20:11] because adoption was not to Israel in
[20:13] Israel never they just I'm sorry
[20:17] Israel adopted this from the Greeks and
[20:21] the Romans but what I read last night
[20:24] which is real
[20:25] profiling the guy said the guy said well
[20:29] excuse me you come into the family if
[20:33] you're born into the you know you didn't
[20:35] know that what you might know exactly
[20:36] the boy but basically when he said he
[20:40] said you get what you get when you have
[20:42] a baby you get what you get
[20:44] run but when you adopt somebody you
[20:47] already know their character you know
[20:50] what's coming you know what those people
[20:52] are so even in Roman times they could do
[20:56] later disown their own children for
[20:58] being disobedient but they couldn't
[21:01] disown the adopted child because they
[21:04] knew what they were getting when they
[21:06] about you know in man a same way with
[21:08] God he knew when he was getting that is
[21:14] good and I just came for my nominal God
[21:17] that I'll pull the article up and them
[21:19] on a PDF and let you look let you reach
[21:21] out to pass it out but you got him a
[21:23] good deep revelation of more in some
[21:25] preachers than domestic have about
[21:28] adoption
[21:28] but you received the spirit of adoption
[21:30] anybody that's born again it's just like
[21:33] he said you were in another family
[21:37] family of the devil right you were in
[21:39] another family you were adopted from
[21:43] that family into this family okay
[21:47] and he can't take you sent you back to
[21:50] that family once he adopts you into this
[21:53] family now he can have disobedient
[21:56] children that don't make it to adoption
[21:58] but he can't disown the ones he adopt so
[22:01] we have received the spirit of adoption
[22:02] whereby we cry and that word would be
[22:05] day to day her father father
[22:07] all right and only babies cry if I
[22:12] brother I'm Coney Pentecostal babbling
[22:14] baby gonna cry now
[22:16] babies cry but when you grow up
[22:21] oh yeah we may we may cry because of our
[22:24] kids but I don't any dark background
[22:28] becomes with kids remember all him
[22:30] that's when he said why just repent from
[22:32] making mankind remember the Bible says
[22:34] any side where I just really repent from
[22:36] mainland right what about God repent and
[22:41] that's what the Bible says and we know
[22:43] it's not exactly the way it is with us
[22:44] but but he didn't do anything wrong he
[22:47] just you know what I guess he knew what
[22:50] what I know he knew what was coming but
[22:54] when he happened he's like but it still
[23:15] surprises me might be but it surprised
[23:17] me but he just got aggravated with man
[23:21] we will figure out one day that God just
[23:23] more of a human than we ever have men I
[23:25] mean his emotions and all he's not a God
[23:28] with no emotion he's not a god with no
[23:30] laughter he's not a God with no you
[23:33] don't get stood up around the throne you
[23:34] know a little office tattoo you know he
[23:36] has emotion I repented from making man I
[23:39] was angry my anger was kindled he said
[23:43] yeah okay so I'm just telling you what's
[23:45] positive and Jesus planted a rope
[23:49] grow some people out of the temple we
[23:51] did that then kick us out man but it
[23:56] needs to be done all right so we've
[24:00] received the spirit of adoption not
[24:01] adoption so we haven't give the car keys
[24:03] to the kid
[24:04] okay we've been through this relevé of
[24:07] preached it's not preached it for years
[24:09] and years and years three stages of
[24:11] adoption right you gotta have a new
[24:13] birth to even be considered in adoption
[24:15] so you receive the spirit of adoption
[24:18] because my brother Nell said a wonderful
[24:20] quote but Keith Reed users at all time
[24:22] God will not adopt the devil v so he
[24:28] won't adopt the devil children and it's
[24:30] not that he don't care about them is
[24:31] that they don't care about him I mean
[24:34] God's compassion he cares about
[24:35] everybody when he knows he has one thing
[24:38] first
[24:38] if I was done now hearing down for the
[24:41] whole world but I know there's only a
[24:43] certain group that's good that's gonna
[24:44] exactly except what I be in all the
[24:48] other billions are just here for walking
[24:50] around you my brother Rams a cannon fire
[24:51] I would hate that that would be
[24:54] something I would but that's nothing
[24:56] we're God we go you know the spirit
[25:05] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[25:07] that we are the children of God now if
[25:12] you have a spirit of adoption if you're
[25:14] born again your the children of God now
[25:15] you may be like the brother Ramsay they
[25:19] went and served God all them years and
[25:22] he what happened to brother Ramsay is he
[25:24] got an evil spirit on this spirit now
[25:27] that happens to all of us
[25:29] some of its drinking you you can and
[25:32] your demon okay you know man your name I
[25:35] yeah although it's name your demon
[25:38] that's what this is for this is to get
[25:40] rid of that okay but that brother Ramsay
[25:44] a born-again Christian preacher gets the
[25:47] spirit only goes and drinks beer says
[25:49] I'm finished I'm done but you know what
[25:51] God did got brought him home well he was
[25:53] a disobedient child he was a mature
[25:56] Christian he ended a statue of a perfect
[25:58] man he would be doing that but being an
[26:00] immature Christian you still Christian
[26:02] Rembrandt see God took him home did not
[26:04] March name so he's gonna do the same
[26:06] thing with anybody is a spirit can get
[26:12] on you I promise you I promise you if
[26:17] you haven't you're in for a surprise
[26:19] ya know I say my hair
[26:26] because you know what the very demon
[26:29] that tells you everyday that you're not
[26:31] a Christian where do that it's in your
[26:34] spirit realm it's not your soul if
[26:37] you're born again it's alive
[26:39] but when it comes out here he makes it
[26:41] sound so good when you did this you you
[26:44] know it goes from listing things he's
[26:46] the good things a good listener you know
[26:48] in the LRV still always telling the
[26:51] truth but the truth that he's telling is
[26:53] the latter okay because what stands are
[26:58] you talking about him God standing over
[27:00] here and he's accusing us and gods going
[27:04] what do you know about don't remember I
[27:12] don't know that there's so much the
[27:14] devil brings things up but we bring it
[27:15] up we have our own self sure the devil
[27:19] you know what'll happen this is what
[27:21] will happen like with that brother Randy
[27:23] I think I'll go this way since I feel
[27:26] glad to go this way you he probably
[27:28] didn't say when I'm just gonna block
[27:30] drink beer I'm done I'm finished no he
[27:32] probably sat down one day and said you
[27:33] know what the people in my church can I
[27:37] tell Joe you know lobster's honey you
[27:40] need to get up go to church today he's
[27:42] ain't going to turn bunch of hypocrites
[27:44] and liars
[27:45] she said honey you gotta go to church he
[27:47] said she said yes you do you're the
[27:50] Bassman so maybe that was he sat down
[27:55] one day I only just you know was just
[27:58] going that freedom she just you know
[28:05] what that opens the door and then you
[28:08] what you let it fester and you let it
[28:11] you let it go and you let it roll it and
[28:13] finally you know what he says he's is
[28:15] fully I'm done with I'm going to still
[28:18] get drowned and forget about you know
[28:20] try to drown my sorrows watch what he
[28:22] did guys I mean
[28:23] thanks to what it did I don't think he
[28:25] just one day was preaching in the pulpit
[28:27] in next mighty morning he goes in I know
[28:31] it was some ongoing something that
[28:34] carried on maybe months but once he
[28:37] decided to do that
[28:39] God said well you can't do that bill a
[28:41] child you got to come on home that's
[28:44] what brother Ron said thank God for a
[28:45] prophet to tell us because if we were
[28:48] looking at it come on peopling we were
[28:50] looking at it from the outside we would
[28:54] say that man lost right but brother
[28:59] brown said no he was a son of God he was
[29:01] a child of the devil so we must be
[29:07] careful the spirits they have been
[29:11] witness with our spirit that we are the
[29:12] children of God
[29:13] all right so we're born again in a
[29:15] family with children God we are in the
[29:18] line of adoption now all right because
[29:21] we're not the devil's kids anymore
[29:23] God has adopted us Eastman I will talk
[29:26] about this after then we're the old the
[29:30] old and what got me yesterday was was
[29:34] Anna talking about even in natural
[29:36] adoption the two that she's adopted they
[29:39] have all new birth certificates just
[29:41] like Anna birth them in her garter yes
[29:46] they're total hold back life is done if
[29:50] you pull a birth certificate they were
[29:51] born to Anna Roberts and Richard Roberts
[29:54] at this hospital at this time I told my
[29:57] life and I see you've been busy
[29:59] you had babies in freedom hospital they
[30:04] asked her at bread or things thank you
[30:07] right now through all of you but they
[30:10] asked our city to live at this address
[30:13] then we got put down that grace you
[30:15] lived in when you yep
[30:21] so I pulled a quote from the invisible
[30:25] Union where brother Brown says almost
[30:27] the exact same thing but he's not coming
[30:29] to birth certificate he said your old
[30:31] Union has been done away with so in
[30:34] other words right now being standing
[30:36] here I can see that my birth didn't come
[30:38] from Peggy and Samuel Dale in
[30:41] Gainesville hopper with Hall County
[30:43] Hospital back then call Kenny Hawksbill
[30:45] on January 26 1960 that was my natural
[30:49] part I've been separated from that now
[30:50] my new birth have a birthday time well
[30:54] the Uni same brother 17 1998 the union
[30:57] of their natural parents is gone yes yes
[31:02] true
[31:03] well yes justice you know what programs
[31:05] say God put it in the sea of
[31:07] forgetfulness so he's not even remember
[31:09] that you Meredith Big Mac that you sorry
[31:11] he don't even remember that you were
[31:13] born forgetfulness he will not remember
[31:23] either that's what you don't know what
[31:25] you got remember month what women I
[31:31] think that's the time and I'm them don't
[31:36] even remember and these kids did not
[31:38] remember all that seven years that
[31:42] Thomas lived
[31:43] hey that's that's God you know Union
[31:47] just like games they just like the mom
[31:49] and dad never don't know that moment
[31:51] they never guessed it I just said it
[31:53] just wasn't my mile and I think that God
[31:55] can't remember something that's what he
[31:57] said oh my god
[32:02] we mean you know did brother Brahim say
[32:07] if someone's forgiven for something
[32:10] if you bring it back up it's on you yes
[32:13] ways that's covered by the blood that's
[32:16] why I said when people come up to the
[32:17] prayer line he said if they if they
[32:19] confess that he said it's under the
[32:21] blood he can't pull it out or he can't
[32:23] see it
[32:24] and God can't see it anymore see that's
[32:27] what we government to me the in town now
[32:29] here we are that we know where we came
[32:32] from what we're doing in where we're
[32:33] going there's no bad news medicines
[32:35] Pentecostal don't stand in a pulpit
[32:36] today and tell you and can be able to
[32:38] track your genealogy and your lineage
[32:41] sure you go to church in them then they
[32:46] go Baptist today and they say ok you
[32:48] were saved God come in and filled you
[32:51] with this spirit and now you're
[32:53] Christian than your little Christian
[32:54] life well that's about all you're here
[32:55] yeah right that's about all you hear you
[32:58] don't hear that that whole thing that
[33:00] you did is dead thank God can bring
[33:03] about that but so looking at it is
[33:10] afternoon because I'm going to bring a
[33:11] little bit about adoption because
[33:12] remember like we were talking that last
[33:14] night in that force field that we're in
[33:17] now you have to come to a full stature
[33:20] you have to come to adopt in you have to
[33:21] come to a resurrection and embody change
[33:24] all in that fourth seal because we're
[33:26] going after that so we must cover like
[33:29] today we're going to cover spiritual
[33:31] death part two but I was thinking this
[33:35] morning you know the mere resurrection
[33:38] that has to be thing you can't resurrect
[33:43] a live person that's why Jesus said I am
[33:47] the resurrection he's coming from me
[33:51] that's why then I got to thinking a
[33:54] little bit more see show me all the more
[33:56] sleep second service - I'm going to
[33:57] email so and that's why I got to it back
[33:59] with it God took back when he said I am
[34:03] the resurrection and the life he took
[34:06] that with it because there's nobody been
[34:10] resurrected to eternal life until the
[34:13] end I know I but who was he
[34:19] he was the son man
[34:21] that man standing there listen I am the
[34:24] resurrection and the life at that moment
[34:25] was the Son of Man but his body had not
[34:29] been changed yet but when he came out of
[34:31] that tomb and he said all power pay
[34:37] attention so we got a stand in our
[34:42] natural dead body in our natural getting
[34:45] old body and saying that's the only way
[34:48] you can get them dead Saints out of the
[34:50] ground because remember the Bible says
[34:51] we which are alive and remain shut off
[34:53] prevent or hinder those which are asleep
[34:57] the dead in Christ shall rise Jesus was
[35:02] dying in his body when he said when he
[35:08] said out of the resurrection his body
[35:10] was not and he looked fifty years ago
[35:11] right right so that proves that it can
[35:14] happen because he called Lazarus out of
[35:17] the grave being standing in a dead body
[35:21] but now when he come out of the grave
[35:25] he said all power in heaven and earth
[35:28] been giving them to me in other words
[35:29] this thing has no more hole this thing
[35:34] has now been glorified because I always
[35:37] had a problem with me standing in a dead
[35:40] body and be preaching the word and all
[35:44] of a sudden the resurrected Saints come
[35:48] walking in the door because of not me
[35:50] but because of what we believe in
[35:51] preached all over the world it'll be a
[35:54] worldwide resurrection okay so it'll be
[35:58] a worldwide sweeping to me a worldwide
[36:00] revival inside of us to be able to bring
[36:04] somebody down out of the ground God
[36:07] change your body and me be standing in a
[36:10] dead body I never understood that go the
[36:12] extra
[36:12] or their last night or this morning
[36:13] sometime when I pulled that scripture of
[36:17] the Jesus said I am the resurrection in
[36:19] LA he told mark then he said I don't
[36:21] know resurrection in the life well he
[36:23] was standing there who looks 50 years
[36:24] old when he won the 30 he was dying he
[36:27] was tired he wet so that's exactly see
[36:32] he's our example everything he does is
[36:34] an example what we're gonna go through
[36:36] because he's coming back I'm sorry he is
[36:40] back to do what he didn't finish he
[36:43] didn't send each member of the brown
[36:44] State remember well around 7 when he
[36:45] left he was bent he's got to finish it
[36:48] in the bride because he didn't bring all
[36:51] the Saints out of the ground he didn't
[36:53] even have a sanctum ran out of rent
[36:56] hello not one in the kingdom he did say
[36:58] what no I am to Kingdom till the bed
[37:00] Bangkok okay so so you're saying and
[37:07] this body doing what happened we're
[37:11] going to speak the resurrection and the
[37:13] dead Saints are going to come out of the
[37:14] ground about what we know go out to the
[37:19] tournament oh hey come on family
[37:23] it's not gonna be like a device you see
[37:26] a pile of dirt no it's a secret so
[37:32] they're just gonna hey is that body if
[37:35] that real body of theirs is in the six
[37:37] dimensions which is their salt that's
[37:38] the real you this thing down here is
[37:41] already rotted pretty much and some of
[37:42] them it's already gone back to the dust
[37:44] and ain't even a casket if some of them
[37:47] got to eat behinds and blah blah blah
[37:48] you understand but that body is going to
[37:51] come back into this dimension and that
[37:52] thing's gonna come right back
[37:54] ever okay the angle we know cloudy
[37:58] barely know you know and they're not
[38:01] gonna be going actually they're not
[38:09] believe they're going to know that
[38:10] before we do I just believe that I
[38:13] believe they're in that seeks to mention
[38:15] them they're moving closer to that wall
[38:17] because they'll feel the pole will speed
[38:21] that brother better sitting down slow
[38:22] down there you go how easy but it's
[38:28] already written this is the logo all
[38:30] right but you got to be adopted first
[38:32] you gotta get into the family before any
[38:34] of this can happen we talked about this
[38:35] all you won't talk about but if you're
[38:38] not a family dodging under math all
[38:40] right spare to self bearing witness with
[38:42] our spirit that we are the children of
[38:44] God and if children and we'll finish
[38:46] around here and then we'll get back for
[38:47] Sunday know won't be here that Sunday
[38:49] you got anything right no you won't be
[38:51] here next Sunday look at somebody
[38:56] yeah I'm leaning over love them men then
[39:00] me and my brother we want them all out
[39:03] one of oh I'll have you follow me look
[39:07] and if children my children then heirs
[39:13] heirs of God
[39:14] why because you receive him and join
[39:18] heirs with Christ if so be that we
[39:21] suffer with him that we may also that we
[39:23] may also be what go I fight together
[39:28] okay those who he is justified you got
[39:31] to finish this
[39:32] Romans angled all the way to that
[39:34] scripture that says those who is
[39:35] justified is already glorified you not I
[39:40] get it which 130 Artie one more time
[39:45] Terry we did
[39:50] that's the whole summation of 1 through
[39:53] 29 but you got to go through these
[39:57] things you've got to go through them you
[40:01] know 1 because we're children were
[40:02] babies babies have to have structure
[40:05] what we were from about last night you
[40:08] know you can you can take little night
[40:10] sermons and throw my favorite brother
[40:11] rounds and say here they are there's no
[40:13] structure in their structure is a man
