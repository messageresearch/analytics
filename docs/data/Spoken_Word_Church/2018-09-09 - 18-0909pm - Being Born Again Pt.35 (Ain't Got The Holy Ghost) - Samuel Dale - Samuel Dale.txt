Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and

us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word I pray that you will as I said listen to what I brought this morning I kind of put a message in that I had been thinking on and I do that and I'll lay something aside and bring it out later you know and try to put it all in together to give a better understanding to where we can follow it because when I when I study the Word of God I look at it that way are the prophets message I'll reference from one message to the next message in the books and things you were to see my my old books I've got them in writing volumes and they're all there you know and and I can a lot of times I still use it now because I'll try to think of something that I want to say and and I can't find it in the computer cuz I'm off just to her well then I'll sit there for a minute and I'll think [Music] Ross the mystery and then I'll just go pull the book out and you know what I find my quote so I like all of those things but to tie things together I love to see the things that the Bible has to bring it into manifestation and to show things I love to do that like this morning where we were bringing the the part you know to where the city would turn our hearts back and you know I just asked some simple questions I pray you would just consider those questions and you know ponder them in your mind what I've tried to just more or less lay down a line that this is the way that it came in from John to Jesus to disciples all right know then in other part as to bringing it to her that it comes from now back because we lost away from that we had to start off with that's just shall live by faith yes the Prophet had to come and build it up and bringing it up and it took him about 30 years to bring up the message to were that he could start then and bring his own message and see then that was coming back from there towards the disciples and back to the Ministry of Jesus Christ and then it goes from there to the Bride of Christ being the finish of it all through the fivefold ministry what to me that that to me it just all of it together I can see it going all the way through the Bible and coming out at the end to reach the finality of the goal of it all this is like the statue of a perfect man we take that and we study that and if you'll study it from adoption you'll see that it comes out to the same ending factor our point that your adoption message was but if you take the adoption it'll come out the same way as the statue of a perfect man it comes that's what they're trying to do is get us to see you know what they saw and the disciples is the ones that wrote the message now not the not the novices and the people that come along later Paul is one who is the only one that would basically come on over a little later in time but remember now Paul was a prophet so he had to go to the desert to get his and he said I conferred not with any of them you know over this and he came out preaching brother run said him and Peter preached the same thing so then that way you know it was meant to be in that order but I pray you will listen to that thought and you'll see that it winds up in the last days that brother Branham would bring us the message it would go into the the depth of the understanding come into the opening of the seals to me the seals as Jesus Christ all right that's the revelation of Jesus Christ to be given that no man knew it had not been made known and the prophets message then began in the opening of the seals the other was in restoration he had to do a restoration or work or that not a reform now Luther Wesley Azusa Street Reform restoration in the part of word that they had but reformed in the basis of what they wound up being they wound up not being the move of God that it was supposed to be they wound up with reform all right but then the Prophet came not as reform but restoration bringing it back to the original faith of the fathers bringing it back to where it would be riding that we were built on the foundation apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone I pray you would just take those things and consider the thoughts that I was asking you that we talked about John being to come to be the one that would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children he never preached two messages right out of all the one he had about a half a dozen converse so there's no way that he turned the children of Israel that was not the ones to be turned it was the elect of Israel that caught the message from John John introduced him to Jesus Christ Jesus Christ comes on with whale you know leaving it into that 12 then he comes and throughout his ministry you know he only gets a 120 right it's not a big thing see we're looking for great big things to happen it's so small they can go right among us and us miss it and we'll never see it but to take those things and you just follow it that's the way I study the word I like love to see it compare you know this to compare with this and this to compare with this then I know that I'm following in the right direction you know because that's that's the way that I want it to be all right so just take that thought listen to it it was just a an injected message to bring the thought of what we were wanting we want to pick back up now and where we were on the stature of a perfect man all right so now we finished up on speaking of bringing it down and we've come to godliness all right and coming to the point of godliness we've looked at it as a lot of things but tried to understand to see that as it is with us a lot of the other words virtue see is not to just be a virgin its virtuous life that's power strength all right patience just to show those that stands up so much in front that you can see them and you go to temperance and that's not to not drink it alcohol that's to how to control that temper and see then I hope you caught the point he said well but when I got born again I ain't had no temper since then well who's blowing the whistle you know as the story was told you know that it's not a joke but the cat was whining like everything one day and mama said to Johnny said Johnny said you're pulling that cat's tail he said no mama I'm not pulling his tail said he's pulling it huh you get the point you get the point what I'm talking about I'm not trying to cause confusion I'm trying to straighten a lot of it out to get us from squealing so much and and we're showing by our squealing that we don't know where we're at right see that's uh that's take it from that okay now so we're talking about godliness as I said to you back there in the message a good bit about it that we are supposed to be taking what the Prophet says these words mean and the application of them instead of what the literal spelling of the word or the literal thought you know see our thoughts is is leading over to something like the patience the temperance and time leaning it over if we take it to the wrong thing we come out the wrong example but if we get into what the Prophet is saying now I'm doing this more for another message on down the road a little bit all right I'm gonna lay in a little foundational part because we're going to get to it when we finish this up be a couple of messages but brother branham sitting talking one day he said about the innocence statute man on the true baptism of the Holy Spirit no what does he mean true baptism you say oh yeah but we've got the anointed ones that's not the true baptism that's that can be the baptism on your spirit what does he mean when he talked about true baptism there's a lot of things that we need to consider if we get to it this afternoon if not we'll move it over and we try to pick up like brotherly kindness and we're trying to deal with brotherly kindness and it might not be exactly Oh the thoughts we have of brotherly kindness it can be other things that's my point of trying to get you to look at the statue of a perfect man listen to what brother Branham says these things are all right tell us what virtue is tell us what what temperance is tell us what you know patience is and things and it comes out a little different from what we have our mindset as to what it was the saying and that's the main thing okay all right coming to godliness brother Brennan city looked in many dictionaries and said he couldn't find the definition well we said then finally he found the definition well now I'm as honest as I can be I think that that's we're not getting a point there I don't think he looked in five different dictionaries and never found the word godliness right because it's in the dictionaries you know I think what he's saying is the definition I wanted to find of godliness was what I couldn't find because godliness in the natural dictionary would read you to be in pious deities and things making your words coming in to the form of of God in his ways and things instead of being what he wanted so he wanted the definition of godliness to be like God well that's that's just know the Pope he can take all of his glory hallelujah everybody thinks he's God right they worship Him as God is that the kind of gardening this you won't there's plenty of people who have whole lot better lives than me and you have right you think in your mind about somebody that in your life and you do it that was a real good person and you could say you know they were really godly in their living well but don't have it all the new birth so we need to find out what these words mean by profits definition okay because when he got to gets to brotherly kindness when he comes to that point he's he just laying it down like a thought about your brothers then all at once you got to go to another message he pick it up and then he begins then you can understand that he's not just talking about loving your brother he's got some other things in mind so that's what we need to do that's what I'm trying to do is to get us to dwell on what is the Prophet saying about these things that should relate to you and I all right now so if it's to be like God so you'd say well we're just what we need to do is just just be like God well what does being like God mean okay you'd say well it means be like God is pious and holy and all Etha that's not exactly what he's saying he's got a position it's got a thought to it that dwells in a heavier stage than our understanding so let's get a little bit on it okay now forgive me for repeating a lot of times that the quotes and the things but I found repetitive is very helpful it helps us to remember all right now so what did the Prophet say about this godliness that was a rare or an odd statement what is to be like God okay now brother Branham we're asking you the definition and he said I looked in many dictionaries and said God didn't this means to be like God all right now what is it brother Branham to be like God when we say we can't be like God and he says yes you can well now are we going to argue the points with him or take the thought and find out what he's talking about all right so he says you know he found the word godliness all these different places you say I can't what does he say in faith first or not attempt was played then be like God he says we he said you say I can't do that brother Branham oh yes you can so now whatever definition we have of godliness now we have of godless is not attainable you know no no listen to what he's saying well we have a definition of godliness is impossible for us to a time and he said yes we can now he's going to give us the definition of godliness and then by giving it to us we can see the possibility or I may I'll say it because this is why I see things you know when I see things in the Word of God I don't know whether you you're crazy as I am I know you're not but I begin to see a little hole in the ground all right and I keep looking at the hole in the ground and the closer I get to the hole in the ground now I'm trying to explain something in the spiritual okay the closer I get to the hole in the ground I begin to see light on the other end and as far as I get in the tunnel then I get to a place that I'm seeing light that away and I'm seeing light this way but that's not I'm wanting to go to that light because that's what's leading me now I'm talking about the gospel I think talking about that's going to a bill or a wall and look at it seeing it I'm trying to explain how I do things that as I begin to see something and it begins to unfold it'll begin to unfold very gradual some of the things that brother Branham says in the statute of a perfect man I admit that sometimes it took 20 years to understand what he's talking about he says godliness yeah and I say I can't be that and then though he's not talking about trying to be pious and golden good so I got away from that but I think he says we can do it well then I got to go to him that's my light at the end of the tunnel is to go to him to find out what's going on all right now he says I can't do that brother Branham oh yes you can now we know the story behind the emphases of things that the Prophet would say that if God requires us to have anything it is necessary that he make a way for us to be able to attain unto it if he requires it is that true no he is up to him all right so now how does he make away what definition does he give of godliness that gives us light at the end of the tunnel to be able to look and see a little bit maybe a little ray of light as we call it let's just read a few scriptures here they told me been godlessness Matthew 5:48 we take this one and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 and see if you're supposed to be like God now then he say in Matthew 5:48 shows us that we're supposed to be like God are you reading come on read read what is that and see if you're supposed to be like God you know Bible says you're gods okay Jesus said well all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you there's Matthew 5:48 right being Jesus speaking in the Beatitudes be therefore perfect what's that perfect as your father in heaven is perfect now look this is what I love when I admit it took a long time to be able to understand what that was being said go look at it we got way up here now before you're asked to do that you got up to godliness then where's godliness one two three four five six you know way up here now be there for perfect comes into view you see why we couldn't understand it so we took the Baptist idea of perfections or this idea about it and we could never move any further we finally come up with the definition of being perfect is to to be complete let this kind of settle it and he dropped it all right but now listen you got way up here now before you're asked to do that why now I'm reviewing so come on and catch out so we have problems in these areas here we have problems in those areas so when you're born again he said well God expects me to be perfect now that's not what the Prophet said as far as God is concerned we're perfect right if you're born again you're perfect far as God is concerned off but that ain't according to what I'm concerned with I'm concerned with me and that's where we live that all right look you've got way up here now before you ask to do that all of these things has to be added first thanks virtue or knowledge temperance patience has to be added before you're required to be perfect and to be perfect is godliness okay is that what he say then when you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness sons and daughters of God that's right anything he said I could say but one hit man you come all the way up to you called them all the way up to godliness and God expects you now to be perfect huh now do we need to read view that any at all because the faith you can lay in it and say well with this editor will remember virtue you got some problems are especially temperance when you've got a little uncontrollable temper let's see that's where our problem is and what our trouble is we won't admit it no I know how no temper so right now I'm gonna just follow the Prophet through the best I can for him to tell me how bad I was but after a while he does expect me to start moving in the right direction okay now is that what we're getting to now look what he goes on that's I have to use the mobile Isis let's going up to paragraph three oh nine we'll just run it on up painting look thrilling I look after you done come from here to here to here to here to here one two three four five six Niner seven one of the two now you're coming into the full stature of a son of God but you've got to have this plus all of this and you can't even start until you get this all right now you're looking at the pyramid what's he saying you got to have this and this and this that but you've got to have this before you even start because that's the new birth huh little brother Dale I don't know I've gots problems what you what are you doing now because it's just I just finally got around to realize the new bird made me perfect now you're telling me I ain't perfect you're not complete if you'll take the definition of it you'll see yourself when you got born again you as a baby in Christ right is that what the Bible said desiring a sincere of milk of the word that we may grow thy buys that's the scripture all right we're babies babies ain't perfect human beings you know what I mean they perfect babies but after a while they ain't too perfect right cuz they start acting like okay but listen see if we use the word complete in our understanding let's say I remember this one most of you can remember Oh in the Bible it uses the word and a lot God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ God and Father that's two of them right now what's a simple little point that you can use to eradicate that thought you just translate because it's done in the Bible you translate the word from an to even we knew this in the Baptist Church Presbyterian shake a head because we knew a lot about that right we we did understand a few of those words so you're not reading God and Father God even father now you've just made a little translation in error at work I'm just translating with me the right word in your minds capacity to understand a little better so when you're reading the Bible and you're confused about where it says something like that God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ yeah this write that in your Bible if you need to you know I mean there's no problem because you're not destroying the Bible you're just putting it and understanding to where you can follow it so it's God even father of our Lord Jesus Christ that's simple that helps a lot or understanding all right yeah so is it with this after you don't come from here to here to here here you're coming in two full stacks right now it's not oh god you got how this this this there's no you can't even get started until you get this when you come down here now watch him when you get down here a genuine born-again dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you come going up alright coming into perfection now so what is Matthew 5:48 bu therefore perfect what is godliness to be perfect well then translate the word in your mind what is perfect mean then you get into the way from trying to find out sinless something in to realize in what everything is and realizing that perfection is godliness but it's perfection in the basis that it's a full age maturity is what you're dealing with throughout the statue of a perfect man you're dealing with maturity to try to understand what is being said and remember maturity I mean my kids they come in home you know I'm there I went to ninth grade a couple of weeks in the 10th so I mean literate okay and the kids came in telling me all about this word called algebra a equals B and I didn't understand it and one of them said well daddy what it simply means algebra comes down to where you can use it like this said it means PI R square that's algebra you come you know 3.14 okay I do know that over here what I tried my best to get every one of them to do something and they would do it I told mind you go back and tell that teacher that yo daddy said he didn't care what algebra said pi wouldn't Squire cornbread square pies round I never did get me all right Jake you a little bit where you listen now all right go we got another thump to go all right but now listen you come all the way up to godliness and God requires it were perfect and godliness and he's given us the definition of godliness and perfection to word that we can come to complete and we see that we are complete in him but even at the point of godliness were still not complete like the disciples were that's the main thought because they were perfect they were complete because they had the understanding of the word all right now in doing that you come all the way up to where you're at then you're asked to be perfect you're asked to be complete and the Bible says we're completing him so then he's making a way to give us the definitions of things that we can see a little ray at the end of the tunnel to be able to follow that and to look forward to something and we can see well hey this is this is not getting too bad after all oh because he's waiting on us to come to a place of perfection and he's given us everything we have need of which is this message brought to us by the disciples you know what I'm talking about they brought the message he broke it down to us Peter name wrote the statue of a perfect man brother branham and brought that to us into our own language and terminologies and understandings to where we could follow it and see a ray of hope for perfection you know of a hope for godliness me and then their ideas of godliness and things change a little but he brought it and he said we bring it all the way up to here still gonna look where he came they come to godliness let's see I have to keep relating back to this because one time if you lose my thought you're gonna lose what I'm talking about so then we come to godliness godliness is to be like God the Prophet takes you to being like God as to Matthew 5:48 to be therefore perfect because then the word perfect can be translated down into our terminology in the natural to mean complete then we're not trying to look at something as godly or what I got that's good I hadn't done I hadn't seen to all week long boy I'm doing pretty good yeah well I got one coming though you know another week so don't worry about it yeah but he's just trying to get you to think about something and why would a prophet make certain statements why would he say that perfection is godliness our God in this is perfection of which the way you want to terminology what would he say that he would say that to try to straighten out our thoughts about what's going on right okay now let's read another one you know how to express this as a point okay but writing preaches the message called a statue of a perfect man that was 10 10 14 then at 11:04 in origin which would have been a little while later he preaches a message called blasphemous names he does not explain in statue of a perfect man about sister Sheppard's dream he doesn't know about it well she comes to him after he preaches it and tells him that she had a dream and that the dream he said to dream was scriptural and exactly what he was preaching with her dream all right do you understand that then so we'll be using for blasphemy insane statue of perfect man you see you'll never follow the message of the statue of a perfect man incorrect understanding without blasphemy it's not because blessed see miss now even give you some keys help you to understand now listen to what he goes so he's explaining Christ mr. godwyn I mean a statue of perfect man I love that Christ the minister s one things in me in the Statue of a perfect man he's explaining these virtues but he's not giving he just given you a definition for making sure we follow what he means by virtue what he means by temperance what he means by knowledge what he means then by godliness okay now he comes over a few blasphemous names and he tells the dream in the things and then he gives the interpretation so go ahead were number three and let's get something in here he makes an outstanding a statement from blasphemous names 62 to my knowledge I had temperance self-control I like that my country kids with the crown my soul with self-control from sea to shining sea that's which means we got problems all right patience oh my tested don't you worry Satan will count them for you but look what he said I'm climbing up the ladder now I've added virtue knowledge temperance now I've got to add patience and watch what he says I still ain't got to hold it goes no brother branham what are you talking about because you spent the whole emphases of the statute of a perfect man the very beginning of it and all the way into 20 or 30 pages explaining how the new birth was the statute was the point to bring you eternal life the new birth was the born-again experience and that you can't there's one direct quote I've got it in here you can't even start well he said it well ago oh no you can't even start without having a new birth and he's explaining the new birth and he's explaining the new birth is eternal life Christ's own life coming and living in you he's expressing it as to what it means to be born again read the message over and over I ask you to now all at once he comes to this message and he's coming down describing them pull it back down this to her he's describing them and he says just like he said about the other he said you come out of this way to godliness before God requires for you to be perfect before he requires you to be complete perfect now he comes into the message explaining the dream which is identical to the Statue of a perfect man he tells it I'll give it to you and when he does he said now I've got to add patience I'm gonna ain't even got to hold it off what is he meaning when you've already got the Holy Spirit as your new birth right you see one church and that's where I don't have a problem okay I know you don't like these ideas and things I come up with see that's why I ain't gonna worry about doing away I ain't worried about my job getting done away cuz my jobs always been one time if you want to make me anything in the world oh this has always been my ministry if you want to know what brother Dale's ministry is where is he in the body of Christ I'm in one time I love controversial things that look odd and look unexplainable and if you'll think back you that have been here 30 40 years you will realize that's what I've done right some of your life and grinnin taking your head everything you know that's what I've done it's a challenge to me to see controversial things because I know that if we can get that straightened out we've got a wonderful glorious thing in our possession you didn't catch this morning.we if there's this it's the same as this this and this okay that's why I love it I love it when the Prophet would say you come all the way up to here and you ain't got to hold it goes yet when I brought around I'd like that woman was what was her name Shepard I believe it was the lady that had to dream I'm like her yeah I never did take nobody's idea as to where that I'm born again or not you know my story I was two years in this message doesn't spent ten and the Baptist Church to a deacon and everything in the world and studying the Word of God come into this message never claim coming in the message as an uber never claim seeing angels as an uber never claimed any experience I've had as to saying that I had the new birth never it's always been the birth of the word that's been that from me from day one the birth of the word the revealing of God's Word so it didn't bother me to tackle when back in the years everybody was saying oh yeah we understand we understand that brother Branham said on Daniel seventy weeks in the book it's in as a matter of fact they put it in a leaflet in the front of the old original 70 weeks book he said if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you can't understand the seals the plagues the vials and the different thing he names about five things that he says you can't understand I didn't name them he named those that you can't understand if you don't understand Daniel 70 ways what everybody else want to study this once they're there you know what I wonder study Daniel 70 weeks and your look at my old book oh it's good I'd read it and I'd put a question mark that meant I didn't understand what he's talking about and when I got through I had a question mark book because every page had at least two it's requested marked right I'm shown to you let's see I just didn't quit and I didn't try to think get out I just kept waiting on God and as I waited on him I'd study it again and I'd wait a while and I'd read it again and I just Ike's out that question and then I understood that still had a book full I never preached it till ever question was marked out I wouldn't do it until all of them was marked out I wasn't scared then of somebody coming along with some idea what about this and what about that I love to help you find it you come to me and have some argumentative form that you want to argue with me about you know what I'll do I'll help you find quotes that looks like they've proven me wrong because once you read them and I say a couple of words you gonna turn off that page onto something else because you're gonna realize the answer is already there that's just - I'm sorry that's me if you have anything you said what's brother Dale he loves to study things that are controversial but wait on God you're not right around him say he wouldn't even preach on my way sir oh hell until it was revealed I did preach on the statue of prayer I mean on to the seals until it was revealed but I always quoted that quote to people you say you don't understand nothing about Daniel 7 new ways and what's the biggest problem we've had meetings on Daniel 70 weeks when they would be 20 ministers and eight or ten of and never read the message which they could tell you all about my brother Brian's name never read didn't even have a book I'm not joking we've seen a man right here stomp to hold the floor if I called his name everyone have you get up Wonka but listen motive random why are you saying when you've always touted you you've taught us the new birth was accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior you've taught us that the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you taught us the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seal of God you've taught us message after message honor these things why would you now say that you ain't got to hold a go maybe he's telling something about the Holy Ghost we ain't thinking about kind of make this a simple statement are you clear enough and work enough there's a simple answer to that question random why you mean any I still ain't got to hold a go if you're only a patient's you don't have the Holy Ghost the Upper Room experience of the 120 had it you don't have it like that that's simple did you follow it look a sample it is he's looking at the pyramid is to see it whether the disciples and what they had and then he's relating to where we are and he says you ain't got to hold a girl you ain't where they were simple these little kids understand that good luck look what he comes home down see what he's explaining it's a birth I've been birthed into this into this into this into this count them into Z into Z into Z into they 7 I think either 7 6 or 7 look then the love of God Christ comes down and seals all that up in me for service now I'm going to drop a bomb and then back away okay ready what was the thing in the lady's dream that she had that the rock box wouldn't hold and it kept running over water right what a water represent the Holy Ghost but what it really represent the messenger pouring the message into the church you don't believe me read blaspheme his name cause if I don't finish what go into this next week got order listen it's a birth of in birth into this and then the love of God Christ comes in and seals you now that's where we've got to get right here on the message cuz we've got one more to finish and then we've got to go right here and some way find out what that true baptism of the Holy Spirit really is God brother Branham says there's a true baptism that's the seal just said it but I'll just back away from it so when I come back to it you'll say hey I remember it now you say you shouldn't do that why at least it makes you think you get all the answers you put it together and you'll have it you'll try to run on your own no worry about but look think about it what about a statement like this now I may miss it a word so just I'm trying to court off memory the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ's Holy Spirit but rather made a lot of statements that not he was wrong he was proving how wrong we was because what was his emphasis on blasphemous names these emphases on blasphemous names was what we're ready to you a couple of weeks ago the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not correctly talked oh it stalled he said like baptism he said like a car's got spark plugs and this and that and the other he said but it's not correctly talked I say you got the baptism the hose I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost just exactly like the disciples had under their Pentecost unquote brother Adam he said we did but now remember on the day of Pentecost there was two things taking place one was a group of 120 that had been tutored for three and a half years the second part is a group that heard one message one got the baptism of the Holy Ghost where it says Holy Spirit on the pyramid the other one got the baptism with the Holy Ghost where it says faith well I don't know her brother branham said dad or not well okay that's no problem with me it's always held me pretty good but that's alright you don't want to believe it gentlemen but look what is the profit trying to explain when he said the Holy Ghost is not correctly taught you know what he said in blasphemous names about that he said people teach that you get baptizes and when he said one of them even baptized in the water he said when I'm speaking in tongues one of them is doing this one of them doing that all those times is taught by the church world as the baptism in the Holy Ghost and he says none of them are correct so only the born-again believer of this endtime message really knows what the new birth is and he like Alan I love it only the born-again believer of this endtime message knows what the mark of the beast is knows what serpent seed is knows what Daniel 7 new exists knows what the seals are knows what the new Burkhardt knows what predestination is did I state it correctly only the born-again believers true born-again believers you realize how wonderful that ought to make you to think that God has thought so much of you to allow you to be able to feast upon his word and to not be confused you were the lady she said she wondered whether she had to hold a ghost or not I can prove by blasting his name brother in said she had it she still wondered where she had there not but you don't want even how to dream about it wondering if she had it you know what to dream was the dream was the answer to her that she had it the dream was the answer to the woman that she had it brother branham finished and finalized it hmm and when he comes down to it I got it right in here he said God accepted her foundation what's her foundation what is all our foundation faith the new birth the new birth is faith what about a church why are we afraid to be to make statements why is it there we're confused when brother Branham is explaining eternal life the conversion he said but the baptism of the Holy Ghost push you into the body of Christ subject to the gifts for service it doesn't make you any more of a Christian then what's he talking about they said the baptism with the Holy Ghost don't don't make you more don't make you no more Christian well I thought about their tomatoes Christian you mean listen to what he's talking about he's up in the statue of a perfect man looking at things from the depth of God's Word to seeing those disciples and the way they see it what about it let's see if I can find this other one number four you must be born again and now I'm saying this and know what's going on tape I want to say this to the passengers that will perhaps receive this tape I suppose maybe just a little what I suppose maybe just a little different from what the regular Church teaches I teach and believe and believe can sufficiently proved by the scripture that you're born of the Spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit what your prophet said that he was different from everybody else about he surely is he's different to the people of this message in trying to do it cuz they aren't gonna accept that you think they're gonna listen to that statement he says he couldn't prove it by the scripture that you're born to the Spirit and then baptized into the body what about him what about these things if Christ has closed us with the Holy Spirit and been adopted into the family after being born again and been baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit it's a true witness of God as adopted been adopted into the family after being born again that exactly what I don't understand this is one thing I don't understand I'm sorry to even say it cuz you don't take the signal you're I don't understand that dummies in this message that all they can find is a little bitty nitpick in time if I was wanting to find some things that would make it look like brother Branham didn't know what he's talking about there's a lot of things that can be found but with the Holy Spirit and let him put it together it's the most beautiful story there is because it has no loophole trying to make it just briefly plenty doesn't know how to make it you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you then have the new birth when you believe on the Lord Jesus you receive a new thought a new life but it isn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you got the new birth when you believe you got eternal life it's a gift of God that's gift to you through Sovereign Grace by accepting the gift that God is giving to you and he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life has everlasting life that's the new birth you're converted it means you're you turned around the baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you into the body of Christ subject to the gifts for service it doesn't make you any more of a Christian it just puts you into the body now see adoption adoption does not make you any more of a child of God than the birth you receive natural adoption if you adopting the child it makes it no more when it's adopted but we don't want to read brother Branham but yet you tell me you're just too intellectual you do this well why don't you get up here and read I'm not trying to be sarcastic or aggravating or anything show off with what I am or smart oh it's been that way all of my life slight worried about it you think what you won't do about me but did your prophet say it did he say I can prove you're born again and then baptized into the body do you believe that now question number two can you explain that can you explain turn alive when you believe but here's what we fail to finish reading he said when you truly believe you don't leave no loopholes he just got to keep reading he said if you truly believe in see I'm trying to get you to look at a point he tells you you come all the way up here to godliness think and and now you're perfect comes to patience and says now you ain't even got the Holy Ghost and he's done told you you got to hold it ghost when you're born again see that's adoption he's teaching that's the same thing as a baby in the natural born into the family and then adopted into the family he's born into the family he's a part of the family within he's adopted into the family who's recently placed now listen so you're born again by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ accepting him as your Savior and believing in him giving you eternal life in your soul which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth but then your positionally placed in the body of Christ for the gifts that go with you brother Branham says I've got it in here somewhere he says if you're in the body you've got to have one of the gifts to be in the body so everybody's got to give to some kind so you're born again by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and accept him as your Savior that gives your soul eternal life and then you are placed in the body of Christ for gifts you're placed into the body for what you're supposed to be an adult trained child what is the natural story Paul Paul is taking the natural story of adoption that a child is adopted into the family and in that they adopt their earning a natural story back there in Poland there adopt their own children they don't make them a child to adopt them they're born the child you are born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost which gives you eternal life making you a child of God but then positionally placed in the body by adoption why can't we see that that makes the message so simple it makes the things the Prophet said to score why you don't you don't and don't hit in your mind that you can read it a prophet would say I can prove you're born again then baptized into the body that don't go boom in your brain maybe that's what's wrong with my knee shakes it too much but that's thing that wouldn't preach on until God revealed it to me I wouldn't preach about those things until God revealed it to me now don't worry about preaching it because I believe it and see I steady and steady I spend my time instead of like you and then I get ridiculed about it we're in the the Bible study the other night Wade looked up on the computer I tried it I can find a certain thing but I used to make the statement and people just look at you I don't really know where it comes from the old Baptist days cuz we talk about adoption you ain't never heard a Baptist preached on adoption that adoption is the adopting into the family was the new birth to be brought you into the family we Baptist taught them things you don't pay attention if you're adopted into the family listen this is what what I was gonna say cuz I know it was there now I can prove it adoption is not a doctrine taken from Israel it is not an Israeli point it is a adopted are brought into from the Romans and the Greeks they had the dots in there it is not started by the the Israel the waters are started by Israel it was picked up by the things that will come along in the way when they was dwelling with his you know with the Romans let's see we don't even think like that now adoption breast God that God's him that adoptions in the Bible it was in Israel had adoption I like to talk to you about it Jacob had had many kids well that right and wouldn't Jacob had to 12 kids Reuben was the oldest did a Reuben did Reuben get adopted into the family there's only one out of the family that had any form of thoughts of adoption but don't you tell me a Reuben wasn't adopted when he come to that 13 years of age or 14 so he was adopted into the family but there's only one out of the twelve that had any sign of a New Testament form of adoption and that's Joseph when he got the coat of many colors now you're bringing adoption in to understand it see that's the way I study things to try to make sure that I'm right not if somebody come along you up speaking hey hey brother Dale you know that adoption was was not an Israeli doctrine yes bless God a word I have you understand no I just blowin my own but if he says that and I say yes brother who as you explained to me adoption in the Old Testament because you only have one time that you can even use it as a type of it and that's Joseph the coat of many colors the guy can't say nothing because he knows what you're talking about is the truth see the Word of God is straight brother branham knew what he was doing he said when you're born into the family you're just as much a member of the family as you'll ever be and because you're adopted into that family don't make you no more a member of that family it just positionally places you that's the statue of a perfect man you're born again by the new birth into the body of Christ under 20 got the Holy Ghost up here cuz they were tutored and trained 3,000 got it down here as babies it's the same new birth it's just a depth art a part of what God is indwelling each one with he taught those disciples three and a half years tutored him and trying to that still didn't make him a born-again Christian he opened their eyes to the understanding of the Scriptures as we bring in this morning for the Book of Luke that didn't make him a Christian he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost that didn't make him a Christian they had to go to the upper room and wait on the Holy Ghost to come then when they did they were brought into the family because listen this is one it's going to slap you in the face if we ever get there adoption if you're going to use it you realize a Gentile adoption was not far the Gentile the Bible says adoption was for Israel Gentiles were dogs the new birth adopted us into the family of God then the Holy Ghost will position us as the growth development comes it will position us in the family into the gills and the authorities in the you know the world will come out to be a manifested son and daughter of God he said well you sure don't teach us nothing brother Dale to try to make us feel good and try to make us believe this then if I can ever get you to believe who you are you want to worry about nothing now and we ever realized who we are don't you worry about anything yeah that's what your prophet says that when the bride realizes who she is she'll be in what invincible army now that's not invisible you know it means undefeatable why because she's part of the family why because what does these virtues do come on musician what does these virtues do they place you positionally in the family or gifts as to what you're supposed to be child training gifts when we get to the next time wait a week strike a steady a little bit on this steady on brotherly kindness and how they bestow honey it's the honey of brotherly kindness will hold when the rest won't hold that's what your prophets see when he makes a lot of statements we need to sit down and cap under those statements but Renan what in the world do you mean true baptism on the whole we go well now now what I think that is that's an only one though here no that ain't what he's talking about anointed ones are anointed with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost but it is not the very nature of Almighty God it's just an anointing for their time godliness don't sit on anointed ones anointed ones are not perfect they just got an anointing with the bride of Jesus Christ their true born-again believer she's perfect let's stand together well we got page 389 it is well with my soul 389

Lord it would have been - what in the world is this man talking about because he seems to have already explained I explained all of these other things now he looked like he's changing his doctrine when we find he didn't change nothing he said he taught that from the new birth the beginning brought it all down to an ending thank God for your word Lord that you've given us have your way be with
