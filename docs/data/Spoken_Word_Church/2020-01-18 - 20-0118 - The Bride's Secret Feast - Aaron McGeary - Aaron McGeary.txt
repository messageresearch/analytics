[Music] hey man I'm learning more and more what Instant means this is instant in season out of season I don't know what season it is I just know this is an instant where I was under the expectation that be about an hour hour and a half before before I would be cold up to the pulpit so I'm glad I did it take my shoes off or take a nap or anything as all of a sudden I noticed they're singing my song so we're excited to get into the word usually a preacher's just chomping at the bit this is the perfect song service just a song a special and into the word but I know there may be more following but we'll just do our part and lift up the word for a few moments with you it's good to be here and have my wife and four children we've known some of you for many many years some of you just getting to meet for the first time and this is probably a good practice before we minister tomorrow because my my manner of ministry may be different for you or you may may have never heard me preach before so take some getting used to and if I'm if you need to get used to me well I have to get used to you too my first time ever preaching here and we appreciate the invitation by the Samuel the opportunity to be here and minister at this fellowship meetings it's just a real great privilege and we've met brother Wade before and appreciate the fellowship and the extension of the invitation while you're standing if we could just turn to Psalms 23 to the whole chapter and it's just Psalm 23 not any other Psalm that may be many pages long just six six verses here in Psalm 23 and this might be one of those Psalms that some could quote by heart but we wanted to use verse five in particular today just to share a thought on the bride's secret feast I thought it might be appropriate since this is a fellowship afternoon and we'll have service and then go feast on natural food let's just fellowship on the spiritual food that God has prepared for us Psalm 23 verse 1 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer a gracious Heavenly Father were so happy to be gathered together this afternoon Lord is a customary for these many churches to come together for some it might just seem to be that a custom or tradition but Lord we just ready ourselves now realizing that if you were gather together this many elect under one roof Lord you would desire to speak to us you would desire to do something supernatural so we yield to you now Lord designed that you come take the bread of life as only you can break it to us as the master of the house feed us by it Lord we ask you to come now and just minister to our hearts through your word for a few moments together as family before we continue to fellowship around the word with different ones perhaps sharing things from their heart Lord and gathering around a natural table together to eat natural food may you have the preeminence in all of it Lord we ask you to bless this reading of the word Lord and the rest of this service in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seeds I'm just going to jump right into it here in verse 5 it says thou prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies and so we know when he says thou prepares the table he's speaking about God so this is the Lord's doing this is something that God has done and the word prepare us that means to furnish something or set it in order so he ordains a table God has set in order a table and that table is not just any word in the way that this word could be used it signifies a sacred table something has sacred use something that's been set aside it actually if you to look at the definition of the meaning behind the word that's used here it speaks of the Kings table this as thou has prepared a table before me and this table is a private table it's a it's a table for an exclusive party as it speaks of a king's table and so in this scripture David is remarking that God has prepared him a secret feast one that not everybody is invited to it's a feast we're only a special group of people a select group of people and I love how he says it because it seems to be such a contradiction or paragraph paradox thou prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies it's a really odd place to eat it's a really odd place to have a picnic or to set a table up to have a meal and to be to say in the presence it means at a distance and away from so it's not just that your enemy's right on top of you but it's in in spite of the enemy he's prepared the table even though I have many enemies round about me God has prepared a table it's in spite of the enemy and in such a way that they cannot prevent the fees but one thing that you have to notice is the enemy is there and despite the presence of the enemy God prepares a feast for him and the enemy is a hostile adversary it's one which is against the truth and against those to whom the truth is ordained for and brother Branham says anyone against the word is your enemy and so he says he's prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemy and I want to use this table in psalms 23:5 as a representation of the bride's secret feast that God has prepared to her a table he's prepared her a table in the presence of her enemies and this is a secret feast it's a hidden feast but it's also a protected feast it's a feast which is safe because he's prepared a table in the presence of your enemies where they're there and he doesn't in spite of them and in Psalms 27 which to me is a remarkable Scripture and the message how brother branham takes Psalms 27 and he connects it with the rapture and he David begins to write that the Lord is my light and my salvation he's the strength of my life though the wicked even my enemies would come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell why says because I've desired one thing and in this will I be confident that I'll seek after your face for at a time of trouble you'll hide me in the secret of your tabernacle and he says now is my head lifted up above my enemies right there and the secret of his presence and the secret of his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle even though the enemies are there he lifts your head up above them and Davis said my enemies are all around me and we may feel the presence of our enemies identified themselves more and more we recognize oh that's my enemy that's my enemy these things are my enemy but yet in the presence of the enemy he prepares a table again I want you to ponder the paradox of it this is a prepared table and David said no a host should encamp about me though I'm surrounded by the enemies normally a surrounded soldier would eat in haste you wouldn't have time for a table he wouldn't have time for all the trappings of a nice meal he would have to eat in haste and maybe even forego eating - ready himself for a fight but here there's nothing as hurried there's no confusion of war there's no disturbance yet the enemies are there but despite the enemy's presence I'm see I'm feasting why because it's a secret feast the enemy don't even know what you're doing the enemy can't even see the table the enemy doesn't even know how to get there but yet there you are in calmness and stillness and the presence of your enemies enemies in the presence of adversaries you can just be calm there at a table prepared by the king to feast it's a secret feast in revelations chapter 3 verse 20 which should have special significance to us to know the age of Laodicea and then after the description of Laodicea now there's a something supernatural that happens it says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me so there's something remarkable that happens here at the end of the Laodicean Church age in the order of these prophecies where the Lord steps down into Laodicea is for the purpose of a feast behold I stand at the door and knock and it's not so much that you hear the knocking but you've got to hear his voice If any man hear my voice and open the door says I will come in to him and will sup with him and he will sup with me this word sup and the word that's used is speaks of a supper or feast specifically a formal meal which is held at the evening time where there is time where you take food and food is eaten at a particular time and he says I will come and if you'll open the door to my voice I will come in to you and I will feast with you and you will feast with me so he's promised and evening time feast with his bride and this is a formal dinner when he says I'll sup with them he's not saying we'll have a snack this isn't a snack this is a meal of multiple courses it isn't he didn't step down into this age that we're living in now and say well here's an apple here's a banana here's something to hold you over I know many times we do a lot of traveling in the ministry and we do over 25,000 miles a year just driving together as a family and there's many times your kid will say I'm hungry and we know we're getting to a restaurant where no one coming up ahead maybe an hour way and we'll give something to the kids to hold them over listen in this journey God just didn't give you something to hold you over he gave you something to get you to the end of the journey just as Elijah witness strength of that meat many days he's given the bride something that'll not just hold them over but get him out of here but the Branham says in the message turn on the light he references the scripture man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God the bread of life not just part of the words every word of God every age just don't stay and eat beans and potatoes all the time there's other things that goes with it as we go on into the full course of God's great dinner that sit before his people the power of the Holy Ghost the rejoicing of it of the power and the spirit that has been given and he's using a language which some could key in on this part and some can key on the other part but he's trying to get us to understand that this is a full course of God's great dinner so there's a man here who can turn on the light and he has prepared a table for us in the presence of our enemies to have a full course of God's great dinner not just one part not just a taste here to taste that this isn't just a tasting menu this is the full menu and the seed not air with the shucks he says neither will a Christian eat on the dead okarians from old denominational doctrines and things just desert he's speaking of how an eagle won't feast on the dead things and he talks about a hawk losing its position and all these vultures and things but he says the Christian won't eat on Dedic Aryans from all denominational doctrines and things they want the Word of God fresh is that you you want the Word of God fresh he says the promise of the hour so that's what we want is not just not just something from a day gone by but what has been prepared for this hour he said God promised rabbits in the days of Luther he promised other things in the days of others but now listen there's been a change in diet there's been an evolution of diet they ate rabbits in the days of Luther they ate other things in other days but I want bride aged food I want the food that's from my time from my table for the time I'm living in you he says but now he promised us a full square meal Luther's day they were happy to be in rabbits and they enjoyed especially after those dark ages and the famine for the word of the Lord and the word been held back under the cathodic rule but he gave it a little bit of rabbits in Luther's day a little bit more in Wesley a little bit more under Pentecost but now we've got a full square meal oh I love how he continues the full seven-course meal for all and I'm glad I can you can see it right here in black and white for all the seven seals are opened and everything is ready for the Word of God to those who can receive it's amazing you can read that some people start shaking their heads no no seals aren't open I don't even know what I've wandered into they just I just was told you guys love the word so I'm so then I'm just gonna freak store and if you don't believe the sills are open I just want you to read it from the prophets words he says all the seven seals are opened and everything is ready for the Word of God to those who can receive so we have a seven-course menu as it were we have a full square meal laid out before us and who's it for only for the bride it is only for those who hear his voice and open the door if any man hear my voice and will open the door to me I will come into him and he into me and I will sup with him and he with me this is the day where this transpires and so the bride's feast is a secret feast something to make a believer knows nothing of something nominal Christians do not know it's something that that make believer I labor cannot enjoy now they can pretend to be eating what you're eating but they can't eat what you're eating it's only for the elect it's only for his bride brother manna makes this statement and God as his own interpreter my such a wonderful atmosphere it's a shame I only get 40 minutes he says now that's the word that's prophesied today not Luther's light not Wesley's light and not even the Pentecostal light now we got to have the right attitude because we're not looking down on Luther's life we're not looking down on Wesley's life we're not looking down on even the Pentecostal life don't take a bad attitude towards them you're standing on their shoulders if there wasn't a Luther Thursday we wouldn't be here there wasn't a Wesley state we wouldn't be here if there wasn't a Pentecostal light we wouldn't be here if there hadn't been any of them and we were the bride we'd have to be Luthor's we'd have to be in justification so we can't look back are Pentecostal Pentecost all just forget no no we are bride age because there has been other agents so we don't look down upon him but then we realize as he says that we're not even in the Pentecostal light he says it's gone on up the road now I think of the way that he phrases this it's gone on up the road now it's moved further and as David writes in Psalms 23 1 2 3 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and I'm just wanting to amplify how brother BAM says it's gone up the road the light the word has gone up the road so the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want when I was younger I guess I'd never really got the semi-colon I thought the Lord is my shepherd I don't want him I don't know why just I was like this is just really seems odd to me the Lord is my shepherd I don't want but it means the Lord is my shepherd I have I don't have luck he provides all that I need in him I am self-sufficient so he says the Lord is my shepherd therefore I'm not lacking think of what the bride's been given in this hour says he maketh me to lie down catch this in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he is leading me he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake so there's a shepherd that's leading as he leads he's making sure all your needs are met he's making you lie down by still waters but he leads you there why because it's going on up the road he restores your soul because he leads you in the paths of righteousness he's leading you sees he maketh me to lie down in green pastures at that very phrase it's just green pastures it means new grass now partner that really think really hard now this isn't grass that's been trampled under this isn't grass that Pentecostals doesn't clean down Luther's done clean down he's saying this is new grass this is a field that's never been eaten in before this a posture that he shaved for the elect at the end time as I was leading them out of the Dark Ages they ate over here as I let them further they ate over there but now I brought you to the best crowd now I brought you to a sacred ground now feasting where no one else has ever feasted before brother banner says an invisible Union God has separated us from all the dead religions he says I'm speaking across the nation now all the dead creeds and to what separated us and opened to us a new land this is a new land a new message for this day day that maketh me to lie down in green pastures new grass he says he opened up to us a new land a new message for this day Pentecost dried up and died like Luther and Wesley and the rest of them the life of it is now where it's where the new grass is that's why there's justification there that's why there's sanctification there that's why there's the restoration that gets mapped assaults it's all in this new land he says it's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together good people in there yet has got to be has got to be come out what did he do he opened up the seven seals of the last message after you follow his as he's leading us this is the way the Lord's lis he leadeth me in paths of righteousness he restoreth my soul he leadeth me beside the still waters he's trying to lead you and he's show him the way to go he says Luther's dried up Wesley's dried up Pentecost his dried up he says but he's opened up the seven seals of the last message that's what gets the good people out of it it's the old bit of this word that's what brings the really left out not gathered together little meetings here and there but to really come to the new land to really come to lie down and rest and green pastures this is what brings us out this is what quickens us to life the opening of this word the mess is desperation he speaking how that what God has done in the sari says those great mysteries hidden in the Bible opened up to us on a new field that we never knowed before and perfectly blends into the coming to the Lord Jesus if it perfectly blends in then you don't see the divider and if a carpet layer blends carpet in you don't see the scene so where there's a blending where something blends together he's saying what has been opened up now is a new field I think this is brother branham's words it's maketh me to lie down in green pastures this is new grass a fresh field opened up to us a new land a new message for this day open up the seven seals of the last message opened up to us a new field that we never knowed before you're feeding on something that nobody in the other age is ever known before you could say well they didn't need it in those ages okay that's fine we needed it so we got it so the secret feasts then is connected with the open of the word that's where brother Branham places him so it's a hidden manna something secret that's coming for the bride brother Branham when he's praying at the end of 1962 and he says old God he's he's just praying at the very end there may we'd be one step higher up the ladder until we can see Jesus and his program now what if what a wonderful prayer there at the end of 62 now we have the benefit of looking back and in looking back we know what was approaching brother Branham sensed it as he preached serves is this the time and the sermons that he was preaching around then even shortly afterwards he could sense that something was coming this new ministry which was the open of the word in the open of those seven seals and meeting that constellation of angels out there in Arizona so something within him just stirring and even as a property saying I want to take a step higher up the ladder Lord may you grant this so that we can see Jesus and his program so this was his program here in 1962 s he prays at the end though there's got to be something open up for us and so a little bit a few paragraphs later one paragraph places forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men readies up mighty warriors of the faith he says open this year Lord the hidden man what was he looking for this year Lord the hidden manna the rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God so when he said I want to take a step higher to see the program of God to see Jesus where was it it was something that need to be opened up it was the hidden man it was the rock beneath the rock that's how we would see the program of God I believe God answered his prayer I don't believe the bride is stuck in 1962 a message came in 1963 to help her take a step higher look as she can see Jesus she his program have a hidden manna Graham says in harvest time the hidden man is just for the overcomer only it's a hidden master secret feast and this is bread he's talking about and bread is symbolic of life because it was the substance of living it's what gave the person would eat bread for their substance wasn't always guaranteed meat it was I always guaranteed that but bread and grain there was something that represented life man its strength for life they would eat to live I know that's hard to imagine because many of us lived to eat and I met him guilty as a matter of fact I'll just admit I was looking at good places deed on the drive down it's only a three-hour drive not even three hours but I'm where do I need to go what I need to go eat because it almost seemed to live to eat what are we all here for today anyways I know you didn't come to hear me I thought maybe I just surprise you a little bit to preach my heart out but it's but it's something you should eat to live that's what bread represents I'm eating to live Psalms 27 he said Lord you're the the Lord is the strength of my life he's my bread he's what gives me substance to live and Jesus says in John 648 I am the bread of life so he said I am the bread of life and verse 51 If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever so something about this bread that gives you power over death if you could if you take the whole thing if you could take this bread and eat it and this has special significance in the end time as the Psalms twenty-seven one says the Lord is the strength of my life he's bread at the end time and brother Brahim and the rapture message says what is the shout the Lord himself shall descend with the shout he says it's the message going forth first and he says the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride Christ is that living bread of life it has been opened up to us at the open these seven seals and it's not just something we talk about it's something we eat just as John took that book to meet it and the angel said don't just hold it just don't look at it he said take it and eat it up leave nothing of it behind take it completely let it be processed and assimilated in your bed I want to take this book and eat it all he says take this book and eat it it's the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride that's what this message is the Living bread of life is Christ he says I am the bread of life brother Branham says in wild little Bethlehem we must have something fresh from Christ his word today for this hour he is our freshness our bread that falls every day from heaven upon the believer a man I believe this message is still giving out something fresh we don't have to try to be strange we don't have to try to come up with something new just go back into this go into this message stay with it listen to it read it process it make it something important within your home within your daily lives hello this is life to me this is bread to me uh if I could say it this way and I hope you can understand where I'm trying to place my emphasis we shouldn't just be sitting here twiddling our thumbs hoping that some Jesus is gonna crack this guy and get us out of here he's given us a bread to feed on to lead us to her unseen bridegroom the more we eat the closer we get to me I'm eating to that medium I want to keep eating this bread because it's this bread even as they sang the song in this special scene on this word it'll change your body that's what's gonna do it I'm not waiting for something out there supernatural to happen I want these to omnipotence to me I want this word that I've been given I want to feed on it just changes this body and it's this message we don't need a new man to rise up and give us something to tickle our ears there are no other messengers we've received the last one spiritual food and due season more there's so many things I could have read from this but he says but those who believe God's hour that were living in these things are hidden food amen and he's talking a lot about Elijah Elijah had a he had a secret place he could go he was even in the middle of a famine the middle of everything there's no food he said Elijah had something said these things are hidden food he said just think he's eaten a lot of types with Elijah and Elijah they says God is so hid it that they look right at it and don't see it and sometimes we have to admit some time there's a peer pressure because we're looking at it and we've seen I mean can you believe it that's our Lord up there look at that isn't that amazing what God has done and you're so excited they're just like whoo yeah yeah yeah that's great and they don't even know what you're looking at they just kind of go along with the flow a little bit they just try to make themselves fit in but listen God have so hit it that they look right at it and don't see it the same way that Elijah blinded the Syrian army the same way that God blinds the unbeliever from the true genuine food of the child the believer why it's your secret feast bride has something special she's feeding on in Matthew chapter 24 verses 27 and 28 he find that this chapter there's certainly a lot of prophecies building together and he's talking in Luke 17 it refers to the revealing of the son of man but here it says for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shines even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be and then brother branham makes verse 28 a very prominent scripture in his ministry and really gives an interpretation that only a prophet could have brought for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered together now some translations render it vultures and some theologians talk about different ways of interpreting the Eagles well that rep for the crest of the Roman and they be gathered together around the body of Christ as it hangs upon the cross and only all these different interpretations and we could perhaps take some of those and see see even a compound type there may be a compound fulfillment but then a prophet comes to whom God has given the interpretation and he says that wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's be gathered and he's talking about is the word that the eagle has gathered to because the light cometh out of the east and shines even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be and this coming of the Son of man is going to be a revelation that the Eagles are drawn to it's a light that only they see it's a voice only they hear it's an entrance that's been opened up too hard her load and right there in the presence of her enemies she's feasting as it says in Luke 17 wheresoever the body is there that will the eagle's be gathered together brother brother Branham says in question and answers part 1 there in 64 he says we got fresh food today everybody wants something fresh well we've got the freshest as a matter of fact all the fresh food we eat today and wherever you go and get it whether it be your own table at the grocery store farm-to-table whatever it might be the restaurants they don't have it as fresh as we've got it that's the antitype the spiritual food is the true type we've got fresh food today as the original organic listen this is clean provide' they can't touch this certification nothing mixed in no pesticides not sprayed with this can't go I have to worry about the ground won't have to worry about runoff I listen you don't even have to pay for it price has been paid freely given to you since we got fresh food today that's the word that's promised to this hour be made manifest in this hour that's where the Eagles are where the carcass is hey man that's what we've gathered together for him listen let's just be honest with each other I don't know how far brother Homer Longoria is traveling by the time I don't know how long it is for you to get here it's got to be a ways but what a three hours or so I drove three hours to get here listen we're not just coming for a potluck [Applause] that's our bond that's what we have in common that's why we enjoy getting together we might not even remember the food we eat but the word were feasting on that's the strength that binds us together that's why we drive four hours to come here that's why you do it as regularly as you do why because this word needs something to us it's not the potluck that follows it's the Word of God that were feasted on right now that matters talks that's why the Eagles are here if you didn't know it I'm telling you right now that's why you're here you go that's why you gotta you young people that's why you're here that's why you've come this way that's why God's preserved you that's why God's looked out after you because you're an eagle that's come to this an anointed ones at the end time he says where the fresh meat is the word for the season they're the Eagles will gather where the fresh meat is right he says Eagles is just kind of skipping around in this message Eagles the fresh kill of the word the word that's raised up and fattened and been made manifest and given out to the food for the children that's what I want I want the word that's been raised up and fattened that's the saying I don't want to eat the soup made of the shadow of the chicken that start starving to death or something like that I just moved to North Carolina so I need to learn all these sayings you know there's different ones I've tried to learn through the years that that's so good you put on your forehead beat yourself to death with your tongue things like that you know I treat you so many ways you're bound to like one of them you know there's all these different things you hear the fresh kill of the word word that's raised up and fattened and then he's and then he's he's talked about how you can't feed dead things rotten things to the to the to an eagle and even talks about how that dove it just can't go and eat on the things that a crow can it uses those types many times and then he makes this statement neither can you feed the bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism and I let me emphasize this Pentecostalism isn't just the way you're seeing your songs it doesn't have to do with worship how loud the music gives or the style of music Pentecostalism is a failure to go all the way in God's Word Pentecostalism is not walking in the light of God's Word he says neither can you feed the bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism no indeedy maggot blood organizations nothing doing no no he says the fresh meat that comes from the throne that's what we want we want the fresh meat that comes from the throne praise the Lord and the message it is the rising of the Sun he says a genuine quicken eagle lives by that that's what you got to recognize a genuine quickened eagle lives by that I believe you're all Eagles today yeah whether you're living by this or not and if you're not living by it you just need to be quickened oh you might we might see young people young couples young families where they're just not quite living by that yet they just need to be quickened says he raised up Christ from the grave dwell in you has quickened your mortal body unto his presence you recognize it you're no longer a scavenger think of that story talks about that Eagle here in the barnyard as long as it is that for all the time that it was in the barnyard it was always an eagle and have you thought about it every single one of those chickens had a vested interest in making sure the Eagle never recognized who it was because Eagles eat chickens so every single one of those chickens are going on don't you say anything about how different he looks look one day chickens look anything like this so do you see fires I'm just gonna eat you and you're going around saying I don't get it I don't enjoy this stuff they enjoy I don't feel like they feel in their own oh you're just a chicken now you're just a chicken now but is it really an eagle why because they had something to lose why because the Eagles want it fresh and can identify with that voice and you right back to go to get chickens I'm Scott I live there I know where they hide I know what times they leave the coop God works all things for our good oh those years you lived in the barnyard God's gonna use it for an eagle's good don't you ever regret it don't you look back and think that God wasn't with you once God's quickens you he'll use all of it [Applause] he says you're no longer scavenger he says you're an eagle you don't want the things of the world you're a son and daughter of God your feasting at a fountain oh I love this you're feasting at a fountain that the world knows nothing about he says you're drinking it the world knows nothing about it's a secret feast he says you're eating hidden manna that the world never even know nothing about I don't mind all the negatives never even know nothing that's right they never even know nothing he says for you are an eagle he says that in a couple times you're an eagle you're an eagle young people don't try to get satisfied on the things of this world it'll never satisfy it can sensitize you for a little while it can excite you for a moment but it'll never satisfy there'll be a little something happen it'll get you by for a day but how do you feel the next day listen but this word this manner that's available to these things that you can feed on it satisfies listen when you're in the world and you do the dirt of the world I don't tell you how many times you wake up say I never want to do that again but if you ever come in contact with something supernatural no matter how much it feels you no matter how much it thrills you once you've come through that you say I can't wait to get it again I can't wait to feel that again I can't wait to do that again why it's what you bomb to says you're an eagle hey man I'll wrap it up with this statement this is my last one so I hope these other brothers showed up or we're gonna be eaten sooner sooner than later milligram says an anointed ones at the end time he says the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding says you're not feeding on a man his words will fail I'm brother bana made it very very clear he is I've a son a man revealing decent of man so he's not pointing to himself we know you can't separate the message from the messenger and we should never try to do that but then brother Branham makes a statement right here in teaching on the a son of man indeed something he says can you get it separated now so there's a point you can't separate them but there's a point at which you that messengers message is successful and he's delivered the message and then you can get it separated properly if you try to separate it to get the message you'll never get it but once you get the message you can see it separated you can see who he is and you can see Christ that he's introduced you to he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the Son of Man that's what you're feeding on this is the bride's secret feast and I appreciate this statement here he says if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above all these denominations and things of the world he says will you do it at this time will you at this time do it while we pray I wonder if we could bow our heads for a moment and before I turn it over to brother Samuel or whoever is going to be coming next if in these few moments 30 40 minutes that I've just been expressing these things that were impressed upon my heart if you know you haven't taken your place at this table and you'd want to do so I'd invite you to I didn't like you now as a young person if you know you haven't said Lord Here I am I know I've heard this message feast and I've heard these quotes and these terminologies and something's stirring in your heart saying man just as you were preaching brother harun it felt like my identity was was drawing near to me I there's something I identified with would there be someone here if it's not a young person maybe if somebody who's back slid maybe a young man or young woman maybe somebody who just wants to say whose Lord I've drawn I'm being drawn to this table I've never taken my place but I want to give you an opportunity to stand you're not gonna bother me if it's not gonna bother me if no one stands as long as you have a piece in your heart that you shouldn't I'm okay with that I don't need I don't need someone to stand to vindicate this or anything but what I want to do is I want to impress upon you now before we pray if you want to be at this table would you be willing to surrender your heart to him now [Music] do you want to feed on every word to give yourself strength to fly above these things of the world that's why they have such a pull on you is you haven't sat at the right table yet I'll give you one more opportunity anybody would want to stand so let I want to take a place at this table praise the Lord he says while we pray let me just pray for you now gracious Heavenly Father Laura it is a thrill to me to be able to speak on these things to come together with people I have it fellowship with Lord to stand behind a desk that I've never preached behind to stand before people which is the greatest privilege it's not the desk I stand behind but the people I stand before but I've never had a chance to minister to and to lift up this word this bread this strong meat that we have in this in time and Lord I believe there's power in this bread I believe there's strengthened this food and Lord if there be any who've never taken their place at the table made tonight they know the invitation is open that you're calling to them that you're speaking to them come take your place at this table enjoy this feast come and join us that this world knows nothing about and father I pray that as Eagles we could be more disciplined in what we feed upon more disciplined at the table more disciplined at the feast and orders we have an opportunity to be together for a few more hours and fellowshipping and dining at a natural table may you may you have your place in it Lord may you have the preeminence father I pray that you bless all those who were here listening to these things may it be a strength to them may they be reminded that there's a source that they can go back to that the sermons that are preached over this pulpit are not just the words of a man but it's men of God lifting up the voice together that they're breaking down this body word of the son of man for us to feed upon that there's a source and in tapes and mp3s and books that we can go to and all of it collectively is working together to raise this bride up out of this world to one day meet you in the end father I commit them to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you praise the Lord we'll turn it over now let's just musicians come on unless let's just sing a song anything by once for prior anything like that then we'll go into the others you wonder why flop when we've come to that while ago we would have had by the time for shame the only passenger in the building well that's what I mean you got here later wrote oh that's what I'm hoping they do we'll get here to that time where they could be recognized okay so let's just sing a hymn and if anybody has a need the altars open glad to pray for you and then we'll go in for other part of the service okay [Music] through God's unchanging [Applause] [Applause] something later and who to God's unchanging I'm singing Oh Kouga son changing hands whoa cougar country big [Applause] something's eater Stackpole to God's unchanging [Music] man you exceeded get to the calmed other Tom and greet the people and bring your singing praise the Lord did you enjoy that my oh my you know I'm just astounded at the word the freshness of it the wonderful power of it you know I hadn't seen my brother in about 20 years I guess it's been and I heard him when he first started to preach and he was an eagle then he's got a few more bigger feathers and I'm just real pleased you know and just to say it again you know his dad is a great minister too but his dad shouldn't have been either his dad was actually a warlock to start but God had something else in mind and what is a vindication of the message of the hour if it's fine if dad has it but it's a son's not gonna automatically get it but this son got it that son got it and I'm just proud of brother brother Aaron just wonderful proclamation right in the midst of the enemy we get to feed on the Word of God you know I was thinking today we're living in almost in the age of accusation you know during the entire time except for about a year or so of Noah preaching he was being accused of being wrong and truth be told science was proving him wrong for a hundred and some years all the philosophers were proving him wrong every week though err was Noah with an anointed message and you go down a little further and you see Israel in there pushing on that mud trying to make bricks and there was a prophecy that went out and it was a false one for 400 years but after that it become a real true one and they were under the notion that that prophecy that Israel would be given freedom that it was false and hundreds of years passed and it looked false and then we step ahead in future a little bit and there's a man doing a great work for God arresting Christians and he was doing an astounding job and he was very well learned and he was capable politically and socially and religiously and you know all of sudden though he went crazy he kind of he he joined a cult and and and they're chasing him the majority of his life to capture them they beat him up this ship wrecked him they beat him up again they thought he was left him for dead he come back alive and they couldn't get him stop talking finally king of grips is my Paul all this learnings kind of made you man and they were under the assumption that he was mad but little did they realize that Paul's anointing Paul's word would be writing a majority of the New Testament because it was right amen so here we are in the end time and we there's never been an age of accusation like this age and and never has there been a table set in the presence of our enemies we're being accused politically no matter is if someone hates somebody they're wrong no matter what they do and religiously you know it's going to type the same thing as politics is it's all accusation it's all there's just no faithfulness but there will be a truth amen you know they're tearing up the Constitution of our country and into shreds but it's still holding its own they're tearing up the gospel of Jesus Christ there's websites all over now telling you all the mistakes in the Bible brothers sister feed on the Bible it'll be all right there's there's a voice is all over once again picking on the prophet of the hour saying he's false and they seem their anointing just seems right and now you got to pronounce Jesus some Hebrew way and you've got to believe this you kind of believe that give me the old time gospel because this bride has been sealed with the Holy Ghost this bride just wasn't sealed under justification she's sealed with sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the person of Christ himself and you you can't deny who you are just look at and stretch them out and fly and my what a powerful sermon we heard today it wasn't even exactly preach and it was more a declaration of what we believe that sermon and that sermon alone could change lives in a world where we are hearing so much information that will change nothing it has become scientifically the accepted word that there's global warming and my it just they're not understanding warming we have changed so much in what people consider truth and how they're aging things I heard something Iraq was seven billion years old I put on the internet you sure it couldn't have been six point five billion years old men guessing at what is truth men claiming to have truth why do you believe the message of the hour it's because what it's done to us it is I cannot say the message would be false it would be to say the very life that I've been given is false it would be to deny that a den of X warlock could become a pastor who could have a son who could become a declare of the truth to the to the stature I just I just love sitting behind that man of God many people teach a lot of things and then go off on the word well I like hearing somebody that can teach and still say amen to all the Word of God amen so say amen to the word of the Lord were uh I haven't been gone or I still believe the message I still have enough peanut butter to make it to church we love everybody we're gonna see our day of fulfillment man I remember you Elijah sent to serve and you go up to the hill and you tell me when you see a cloud I don't see anything they look again I see a cloud but it's such a little thing he says I see the abundance of rain amen and God's standard that is raising up is the final voice to this final age which will be you and me so say Amen to all the Word of God in it I just loved what he said about the eagle those chickens had a vested interest you know I like it too but you know the only ones that didn't know he was an eagle was him and I imagine even those foxes you know and some of the enemies that well you know that that's not an eagle but I'm not gonna tell him although you know there it's quite a blessing to have that data ego in that coupe amen but the Eagle come loose amen I can't wait to rise up with the Lord we might not see each other again we may we may see each other on the way up this is really getting close oh my if you've never believed it believe it now like never before cling to this holy scripture don't you let loose of it God knew just what he was doing when he sent a prophet it was to fulfill Scripture believe the prophets because it did rain because Israel did get freed because Paul was right he had met the master oh I just love it love being here thank you to everybody do we have a song prepared come on up just good sometimes come down visit us in
