to be here tonight thank brother Wade for amen I wasn't supposed to be here this is really not my time brother Jason Jackson was supposed to be here and it was and then I guess he something happened and it's fell on me so amen wish sure good to be brother Kanan sure good to see you you didn't come all the way over here just for this service did you you did man we certainly appreciate the Lord tonight if you have your Bibles let's open together to Hebrews chapter 12 you don't mind if I take his coat off it's hard to Hebrews chapter 12 I'd like to read two verses I'll just read two verses Hebrews 12 1 verse one and verse two Apostle Paul says wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Amen just bow your heads just a moment if you would father we thank you tonight Lord for the great privilege that you give us to be assembled in your divine presence Lord in the wonderful songs that we have just sang Lord just encouraged our hearts oh God and Lord we know that your Prophet taught us this is the most important part of any service is what we do with the word of God we pray tonight father that you'd come and that you'd anoint the word to every heart we know Lord that your word is Anointed we pray that it'll come down and speak to every heart to every life may you bless both the speaker and the hearer tonight Lord we've opened the Bible but we understand that any man can could open the Bible but oh God it takes the Holy Spirit to make it live we pray tonight that you'd come father we just pray that you'd help us to get out of the way may you speak to every life may you meet every need that's represented among us we pray now in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everyone says amen God bless you you may be seated I won't spend a lot of time introducing myself but I am Luke Gibson which that really don't matter I'm a married man I got seven kids and this year I have 10 grandkids Enough Said Amen I want to speak tonight if I could for a few moments on a subject that's been dear to me over the last few years I preached in several places but when brother Wade called me the other day just a little thought come on my heart and sometimes you just better to obey the Lord I'd like to take the subject tonight let us run very simple let us run now I'm a Believer tonight that this Bible is our absolute when we live in a world like we live in tonight we realize we live in a time that people don't want an absolute right but I believe that this Bible right here is God's infallible word and God did give us an absolute and his word is our absolute men change time changes churches change preachers change but God's word never changes it's forever settled and will always remain the word of God I want to bring this up but I had a fellow that's been texting me and he's been carrying on conversations with me and a lot that he says sounds good and I I said brother out of the greatest respect I could have for you what you say sounds good but I can't find it in the word and I said we live in a time that people chase after a lot of sensation a lot of things and something that might tickle their ears I said but I'm far beyond that now I said what we say has got to come out of the Bible brother I believe when God sent us a prophet and I do believe he sent one and I believe this prophet's Vindicated almighty God but I even believe brother Brandon's message has got to come back to the Bible I believe it does come back to the Bible I don't believe God sent us a prophet to take us away from the word he sent us a prophet to bring us back to the word of God I heard this message when I was 18 years old in the Pentecostal Oneness Apostolic Church in a tent meeting in ton Georgia I'm 52 years old and I almost 53 and from my congregation I'll be 53 on the 2 fist so don't forget that I've been listening to this prophet and I got to be honest with you brother Wade I've never found nowhere in this message contrary to the scriptures and I get into something tonight that might offend some people but I do believe that our Prophet had a progressive understanding amen I believe he growed in Christ just like we grow in Christ he didn't come out of his mother's room with a full understanding of who God was that's right but he grow in Grace and the knowledge of God I believe if he had to do that we got to do the same tonight but you know I was thinking of that for a little bit on Paul talking about let us run and when I look at the scriptures I'm you know you you was a sports man I was a sports man and secretly I I don't tell it but I still sort of am just a little and when I read the Bible I'm shocked at how much natural things typed out spirit spiritual things the Apostle Paul was one of the greatest at taking metaphors and analogies and just natural things of life and showing the spiritual activity of the work of God in a man's life brother Brandon was the same way took a lot of natural things to express things over here in the spiritual realm because the natural types the spiritual matter of fact brother bam taught us that God's first Bible before we ever had this written word he could look at nature and see God God's in nature he's in his word and he's also in his people but one of the things that the Apostle Paul used was the human body what you think about this minute he used the human body and over in Corinthians he talks about the human body and he would type it with the spiritual body of Christ he would say things like this can the hand say the foot I have no need of thee and what he simply taking his one body that all has to function together and one part of the body can't say to another part of the body I don't have no use of you I don't know about you but I love my feet come on and after this service I'm going to love my hands and I'm certainly going to love my mouth and so tting down I'm going love my belly I like this human body that's right but this human body is a type of the spiritual body of Christ and we find out that Paul and I just want to lay this little foundation for a minute lays out the body and how it functions and Compares it to the spiritual position of every believer that's in Christ and so when he talks about it he begins to show us certain positions of the body and each position that he would talk about represent something that God let me say it this way the spiritual Act ity of the holy ghost in a man's life I tell you tonight God is still at work in his people I don't care how far this thing goes God's going to have somebody on Earth that's going to represent him and he's going to have somebody on Earth that he still works through he ain't way off out there somewhere he's right here with us tonight and so he talks about the position of our body now a minute ago y'all were standing right right now I'm standing I was sitting and y'all was standing now I got to stand over the next few moments and you've got to sit and we have standing and then we have sitting and it's two different positions but both of those positions represent something in the spiritual body of Christ I mean that's go on just for a minute no matter what action our body is operating in even a change of natural position it's expressing something about our spiritual position now let me show you the body I'm referring to because when I refer the spiritual body I'm not necessarily talking about this right there's a spiritual body that every man and woman in here is a part of and that spiritual body is called the spiritual body of Christ so whatever he's doing we're doing whatever his action is there is our actions are here amen let me show you what happens when Jesus dies and raises again he died for our sins he raised for our justification thank God we still have a Risen Lord tonight he don't have to die no more he died once for sin that's it he liveth now unto God I and you are represented in what his body did Brother B said when he went to Calvary we went with him when he died we died when he was buried we were buried and when he ascended we ascended with him now watch this and we sat together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now just watch Ephesians chapter 1 I'm hurrying now blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all Al sir spiritual blessings in Heavenly places notice this now in Christ Jesus now there can be Heavenly places here tonight and there is but they don't mean anything to you if you ain't in Christ now listen brother B said when he s he goes further and he tells us now watch that that Heavenly place is your position in Christ then he reads he comes Ephesians two listen what it says and he raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ now that don't mean when this physical body every time you want to get in Christ you have to go sit down that's talking about what he did that's right the prophet said when he ascended on high he sat down and him shutting down was a sign that the work was finished let me say it tonight if you're identified with him the work for your salvation is completed you don't have to do nothing Christ already did it and we sit with him so his position it speaks something about our position in Christ now listen closely our location can change and even the people that when Paul is writing Ephesians 1 he don't say to the Saints who are in Lula he don't say to the Saints who are in Townville he says to the saints that are in Ephesus so the location that he's writing us to is the Believers that are in Ephesus but then he says and to the faithful in Christ Jesus so it wouldn't matter tonight if I read this in Luna if it's to those that's in Christ Jesus I don't have to be in their location as long as I'm in their [Applause] [Music] Possession come on church amen after 2,000 years you and I are in the same position that the church was 2,000 years ago we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now watch I got to go on now it's not necessary that we be in the same location to those to whom the letter was written to right a few years ago I went with brother George Smith me and a few brothers from the church and we went to Israel we went to the upper room and beny hen had a crowd there and they were all in the upper room supposed to be in the physical location at the early church got the Holy Ghost there's no scripture that tells me physically I have to be in the same location I just got to meet the same conditions and when I meet the same conditions God will baptize me in the same position that that early church was in now watch what I'm saying because even though the letter was not written to us but it's written to everyone who's in that same position setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now watch Ephesus was their location in Christ was their position am now tonight your location is Lula but your position is in Christ tonight my location is going to change I'm going back to Westminster tomorrow I'll be in Townville but you know the same position I'm in right now I'll be in that tomorrow when I'm standing in a pull pit it's in Christ some of you may go back to commercial here in Lula and tomorrow you'll come back here when you leave here and go home your position changed your location changes but never your position now let me tell you this your your location can never change your position but one day our position is going to change our location it'll take you out of Lula take me out of Westminster take another one out of Townville one out of Africa one over here one over there cuz no matter where we're at in the world if we're in Christ we're in the same position and that position position one day is going to change our location can you say praise the Lord that's why I don't tell people they got to go to a certain church just get in Christ you get in Christ he'll lead you where to go to church this might not be popular but I believe if you're in Christ you'll go to church I said the other night holy ghost feel people love to go to church your position pushes you to that now listen so like Paul the Apostle look at him where didd he spend when he wrote these letters you realize that man he wasn't brother Wade like you and I maybe sat in an air conditioned office I told somebody that there said God couldn't have called me to be the messeng of the age I couldn't have been the messeng I wasn't natured that way I'm tell you now I'm not going to no cave at 3:00 in the morning I ain't doing it I'm not going down there waiting on an angel or whatever if he visits me it's going to be in my bedroom and the holiday end I'm just not cut out that way but God had to cut his man out the way he wanted him to brother bam talks about that cave going in a candle they say they found it I'm not saying they had but I'm saying when I've seen them squeezing through them two rocks and get down there I said I'm glad he was the messenger cuz I ain't going there brother God mold his man the way he wants him the Apostle Paul when he went to where his office was where a lot of these letters were inspired from was down in the jail house now I spent one night in jail and I wasn't called of God to go to the jails judge told me he said preacher may his will Lord I said no sir I ain't com here to save him you let them out then we'll get them saved said I'm not I'm not no jail bird unless I had to do it for the cause of Christ but let let me just tell you this Paul when he was down in Rome in a prison cell and he wrote his letters he didn't say I Paul a prisoner of Rome that's right amen his location was in the jail but his position was in Christ so he said I Paul sit in the jail I Paul a prisoner noce that not a Rome a prisoner of Jesus Christ he was identified with his possession do you notice he never one time in the Bible ever called himself Apostle Paul it was Paul the Apostle that's right cuz back in that day a a title a name in front of your name was a title but after your name was a possession hey he was an apostle by possession he was an apostle by predestination nobody laid hands on him to make him an apostle he was called of God from mother's room to be an apostle just like you're called to be a believer you're called to be a Christian or an evangelist or this or that every man in here's got a position in Christ nobody can give that oh I'm going say it nobody can give it to you nobody can take it from you that's predestinated by almighty [Applause] God and the reason some people ain't happy with it that's because you're always comparing yourself to somebody else God made one you and nobody can be you just be who God Made You am listen position can never change let me tell you why because position is eternal security right I know what the prophet of God said I've been around long enough to know that people run out on both extremes and brother B taught us both extremes the prophet was so wonderful the way he' balance things up for us I mean you you've been this message long enough know sometime you get pushed over this side and if you're not careful you get influenced by too many people they'll push you away over here and then then if fact this crowd's pulling on you especially when you're a young preacher they pull you on this side and after a while God really gets a hold of you you appreciate all of them but you come right back to the middle of the road and that's where God wants us that's where we ought to be let everything was off let's stay right in the middle of this message there's people that ain't want is word word word no spirit that there's a bunch of one Spirit screaming holl ain't got no word I believe we can have both of them we can have the word anointing people under the spirit and that's what you see the results hey your possession will go to work then you believe that say Amen now this evening we come and this is really the theme just for just for a few moments I can't preach too long I got to preach tomorrow I'm not 20 years old no more I done said the other night I done crept over the top of the hill there there this is to those listen that are in Christ you Ain in Christ cuz you're sitting in this church now I'm believing you are but I'm just telling you people come to church they AE in Christ brother called over and over and over and over by one Spirit that's right that's right not by one Doctrine not by one theology not by somebody's pet teaching by one Holy Ghost baptism that's how we get into Christ that's what should be taught to every young person got to be born again listen now when we speak just for a minute for these metaphors because that's what they are they're metaphors just natural things to teach us something about the spiritual so when he talks about the body and certain activities of it or positions of it it's speaking of something over in the spiritual realm let me give you an example he said number one I talked about it we sit in Heavenly places right every man that's here tonight I don't care nothing wrong with it but I don't care if you get a goosebump down your back that's nothing to do with your position that means you might have emotion emotions is wonderful I'm an emotional I love emotions I got seven kids I'm emotional I get a lot of grandkids around my house and they get on my nerves and I get emotional I said it's time for y'all to go home amen I said now before you do come in the kitchen I want to give you some chocolate and candy and ice cream and then go home and you torment them the way they tormented me amen I believe in Emotion but I never judge the word of God by my emotions as a matter of fact I don't even judge the word of God by my experiences I judge my experiences by the word of God brother way there's been a lot of times I had some really good thoughts go through my mind glory to God and get in the B say well that ain't what he said I felt emotional about it they love this but if it's con to the word that's right lay it down I don't care how emotional makes you amen I believe in Emotion don't get me wrong but I believe your experiences and all your emotions you got to take them back to the word of God now look sit in Heavenly places your position now did you know he also told us that we must walk in light now to walk you got to get up right you got to get out of your setting position and you got to walk and sitting and walking is two different position and they express two different truths about the Holy Ghost working in your life then he not only taught us to walk he also taught us to stand right Ephesians 6 this is all right of Ephesians he taught us to stand having done all therefore stand and I can show the same Lord Jesus that went to heaven and said one day Steven was being stoned and the heavens were open and he didn't say I see the son of man sitting I see a son of man standing and the prophet said why was he standing he was standing up for his church that was under persecution different possession sitting walking standing all different but they all Express a spiritual truth about the body of Christ now tonight mine is on running and I know some of you'd rather sit than run I can look at you and tell that you've been setting a hole lot more than you've been running even walking don't get mad at me now I'm just kidding you don't even like to stand that long not when you sit so long and you change your body structure you don't like to stand so long either that stuff hurts my feet Lord I'm not saying that to be offensive I'm getting to a point four different activities of the human body but both all four expressing something about a truth concerning the Holy Ghost working in your life setting in Heavenly places what is that the works finished I know people don't like it but look brother I come out of a group that had Works before Faith yes sir Works before Faith leads men to legalism and they think there's something they can to make themselves acceptable god brother said there's not one thing you can do it's already been done you just got to s in Christ relax it the work is already done if God's called you Satan can't take you you belong to Christ I know it's hard but you can't be lost no more than God can be lost your salvation is secure the work is finished he cried out it is finished took his body and put it in the ground he his body went to the Grave his the real part of him went somewhere else but on Resurrection morning God didn't leave that body in a grave it didn't go back to the six elements God raised that body up it was the Redemptive body of Jehovah God and he raised Jesus up and he sets tonight in the presence of God representing you and I I even told the brothers on the way church I heard brother say the other day when you're in Christ and you pray and you pray through the blood it's the same as Jesus praying to the father Brother people could ever understand their position in Christ said when you pray through the blood it's the voice of Jesus praying to the father it's the same as him speaking you believe that now the work's finished so I didn't do it no you didn't do it but you are in the body that did it that's it God that's the key look you realize how much condemnation I can wipe out of our churches by getting the people to put their eyes on the one that belongs on it don't belong on you it don't belong on Me Your Eyes belong on Christ and when you listen what I said the other day I said when I look at myself I don't know how I can be saved but when I look at him I don't know how I can be lost this ain't about us it's about him your eyes got to be on Christ he's the one that finished the work with the utmost respect I'll come to the utmost respect I have for our messenger and I believe in that I do I do but brother B didn't die for our sins Christ died for our sins your eyes have got to be on Christ right listen walk not just sit now walk what does that really mean it means simply this progression now don't you dare walk if he don't give you something to walk in you stay right where you're at right yes sir no the Bible said walk in the light and if God don't open light stand right where you are just stand there and wait you try to force it in you'll find yourself out there in darkness somewhere stay with the light right everybody ever heard of Brother Richard Blair did you ever know him anybody here ever know him brother Mike I knew him in Arkansas one of the finest men I knew walked in SHO leather we different on some things but who cares he was still my brother he told me a testimony how he was in we were come from the same group so he come out of the wers United Pentecostal church and he went down and heard brother bradam in Hot Springs and and when he heard brother brandham he was there in the United Pentecostal Church he gave brother brandham a call later got a hold of Billy Paul and he said he said he said Billy would you ask brother brandham if I should come out of the United Pentecostal church and brother brandham said no said you just stay right there and brother BR began to talk to him and brother BR said Billy tell him that I saw an adulterous Spirit on him and his wife and man brother Prophet God told you that tear you out of frame it tore him out of the frame went back to his wife they sat down they commune went back and forth nothing never done nothing he called brother bam back up said brother bam I through brother Billy Paul said brother Billy Paul tells this said we discussed and said nothing no infidelity nothing but said ask him what church he belongs to he said I belong to United Pentecostal Church he said that's that adultery spirit I saw brother my next statement would be brother B should I get out of there that's what he asked you know what brother B said no my brother stay right there you talk about confusion coming in he said the third time he went down to Jeffersonville heard brother Brandon preach I think this day this scripture is fulfilled got back home called brother Billy Paul said ask Daddy your daddy if I should come out the United Pentecostal church now and brother brother bam said tell him stay right there but brother that morning he said to brother Billy but tell him I heard him say Sunday come out of her brother B said oh that's different then if you heard me say come out come out come on walk walk in this light but don't come till God calls you yes sir I'm going to talk about that just a minute cuz I've got that's what I was telling our brother here before service telling brother Wade I said brother Wade I got a lot of Pentecostal brothers and one in particular we talking about for service that I have he doesn't see what I see they don't even see the message he ain't going to condemn brother man being a prophet but he just don't see his message don't don't don't get mad I had him preach for me right he ain't going to hurt me if I've taught my people correctly he ain't going to hurt my people I want him to see what this message has produced he came and preached for us and he told me he said I I'll admit to you he said this what he said the Pentecostals don't want the word they want my gift I said I know my brother I know I said but he said but I've never seen a crowd like this that loves the word I said brother just give us the word that's right so we got to talk and I went down to Northtown Georgia one time heard him sitting in this little camper there and I walked in his tears rolling down his face I said brother what's wrong he said brother Luke these people don't want to word I said I almost called his name I said brother that's what I've been telling you for a long time but I know a group that wants it has he come out no he can't come out cuz I tell him he can only come when God calls him amen look I don't condemn the brother he's my brother I love him and I pray to God he's somewhere I look I don't care if God CS him on his deathbed give him as much grace on his death bed that you gave me 18 years old I'm not standing with this Grace I want God to give it to everybody he was in the hospital of other day who does his family call they call me they know I love that man right they know that man loves me but he don't see the message but does that mean I got to disrespect him no I pray for him God open his eyes cuz I know if God ever has open his eyes there'll be something to happen to him that happened to all of you you here voice that says come out of her my people be your separate sayith the Lord and your body will do what that voice tells you to [Applause] do so we we walk means progression I know people get mad at it don't care what I can take the B the very message itself and prove to you that brother brandom walked in light but there things he preached after the seal I show you that he didn't preach that same thing before the seals but he could only preach on the light he had but when look it's like brother bam what was brother bam he wasn't even a he didn't even have the light when he first start out some of y'all had brother B was a Baptist right some of y'all were Pentecostal Pentecostal is further than a Baptist right you know the you know what the Baptist is the Baptist is still down on the St the tsle but for that little bud brings for that missionary age John Smith and those men that's where brother B came to Christ at right amen but did you know what happened when God when he went down that little Pentecostal meeting right remember yes God started dealing with him in that Pentecostal church right I've always wondered why didn't God why didn't he just bypass he couldn't he had to travel where the life went at that time the life was in the shook that Prophet come right to the Shu and in his empathy the Shu protected the son of man Ministry in its empathy that's brother brother didn't call an evil sh it was a good Shu he said but it served its time that's right am that's look if God would have took brother bam and brought him from that tassel straight into the seed he would have broke the Contin his own word cuz the seed don't come out of the tsel the seed comes out of the Shu so he had to bring brother B to the Pentecostal age God was so serious about that brother B walking in that light that he even took his wife and his baby you should have never let your mother-in-law talk against my people you know who God's people was where the light was it was in that Pentecostal age there's going to be Pentecostal people went by the way the grave coming up in that Resurrection they're going to be your brothers and sisters in Christ yes sir I got old grandma I know she's sealed in under that Pentecostal Age come to my church but never could truly see what we preach I believe she sealed in under that Pentecostal age she walked in the light that God revealed to her so what happened God brings us prop to that shuck age they protect him y then as his ministry began to grow from the first pool second pool now this very same Prophet that they love to hear him Pro call people's names and prophesy and tell this and tell that and know it was never wrong when he had to turn and prophesy against the very Shu that protected him all them years that became a different thing and they begin to pull away and when the shot pulled away it brought that seed right into the presence of the sun William Brandon was walking in the light you're walking in the light hey this seat ain't going back down in the ground we're not repeating John 12:24 we're in seed time this is bride time this is Rapture time the next thing we're going to hear is that combine come by it's going to sweep that wheat going to slow it up in the air and while it's in the air it's going to change us from Mortal to immortality but we got to walk in the light brother Bram grew we got to grow now if you walk for a while then after a while you're going to come through some things you have to learn how to stand yes sir stand your ground don't back up this ain't called the bread of Affliction for nothing you're going to be tested for what you believe but when you have done all to stand stand therefore and then he'll tell you what you're garded with whole armor of God fighting the greatest battle ever fought but you stand for the word you stand for him he'll stand for you now we come to run you got to run and running is more intense more exertion it speaks more of striving this has to do with a let me just say it like this running the race of faith I'm going tell you why I say say that cuz that's what really the whole book of Hebrews is about it's Paul writing to the Hebrews to tell him that no longer had to be Hebrews Hebrews ain't what you do with your coffee no no they'll get it tomorrow y'all we're in Georgia a lot of South Carolinians here too and y'all heard me say it before and you still didn't catch it now this speaks of running the race with endurance let me tell you why this is on my heart let's take a few truths or metaphors to consider this truth of us running taking a hold of this message and running with it run now people some people run from something others run to something and then some run for something Joseph ran from Piper's wife that's right I'm glad the old boy could run she got his coat but never his character I show you the Bible which we all have done where men ran to Jesus oh that's the best place I know to run when you're in trouble run to Jesus he's a strong and mighty Tire the righteous run into and are safe but then there's some that run for something he said well what you running for well that sure ain't popularity if you're running for popularity you're in in the wrong message that's right we're running for something but what are we running for listen here's what we're really running for we're running for a prize yes this is the Bible I'm just talking about the Bible now you're running to obtain something and what are you run obtain you're running to obtain an Incorruptible crown amen Amen brother when I think of the people out here that are Runners and these marathons and I see what they do to bring their body and subjection to run a race I think oh God where are we at spiritually I just preaching the other night on Paul saying when he come to end of this road I fought a good fight I finished my course henceforth it laid up for me a crown of right brother said not all together a crown like a gold crown your head but to be crowned with righteousness he said a body without sin we're talking about a new body I'm running to get out of this pest house I want to run so bad I want to run out of this and run into another one this one's I didn't know this one could give you so much trouble and he's telling me to wait and you brothers ever had kidney stones yeah nurse told me one night said you know having a kidney stone is much like having a baby I said i' never had one of those she said I have and I've had a kidney stone and the pain is much alike I said that's the case and I was a woman my husband only had one baby right that have been it I might have been divorced but they been one baby unless unless he loves me enough to give me one of them long needles right and you sat there and laugh while babies are coming out that ain't God's way I'm talking about spiritually now I'm not condemning you I'm just saying there's birth pains everybody say Amen now Paul is writing this race of Faith let me get to the race of Faith he's trying look look at the crowd he's preaching to he's preaching Crow he even saids something one day you did run well but what's HED you you say race of Faith yeah he said you did run well but what's having begun the spirit now you think you're made perfect of the flesh received you the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith he spends the previous chapter writing on the great Heroes of Faith I mean starts with Abel and goes all the way through gets to the 10th chapter there verse 38 any man draw back my soul had no pleasure then goes through all the heroes of the faith and com to chapter 12 and say now we're surrounded by a great cloud of w i just preached to you chapter 11 is your great cloud of witnesses you going to see something just a minute but he never admonishes us to watch the cloud of witnesses he's just telling you other men has ran before you and if they can make it you can make it but you got to keep your eyes on the same thing they have their eyes on I'm I'm going to get ahead of myself but we ain't looking to preachers he said looking under Jesus your eyes have got to be on Christ you put them on anything else you're going to stumble that's right you're gonna fall by the wayside you're gonna get tired you gonna get wore out let me go on he's bringing these because Paul whole theme of his Miss I've been preaching it back home on C couple weeks now on the book of Hebrews and chapter one it's the great exaltation of Jesus Christ he is magnifying Jesus in the eyes of these people and the reason for that is is because they looked at a lot of other shadows and symbols and different things he said but every one of those shadows and symbols has all been fulfilled in one man and that one man is Jesus now you asked me do I believe in a one man message you better believe I do and that one man's called Jesus Christ yes I do you say what about brother Bram it's not brother brandham it's Christ it ain't even you it's Christ we ain't nothing that's got to be Christ this ain't me it's Christ the gospel's not about us it's about Christ I've heard some preachers preach well I'll just leave it alone come on they preach more about a woman they do Jesus Oh My this ain't the gospel of the bride of Christ the gospel of Christ he just married a bride Christ is what should be preached now listen every believer that's in this race you are running for your life let me Express a little bit running to obtain an Incorruptible Crown running to win a PRI now I'm not this kind of guy that says winning don't matter I said listen here if winning don't matter why y'all keeping score that's right y'all trying to get me to act like I don't care so y'all can win you know what I'm talking about I used to coach and it was them politically correct mamas that made a bunch of wimp out of our boys just give them a reward for participating I was said oh no one woman told me that they the head man come up there said preacher I know you're not used to this but we're now got to mix boys and girls I saidoh Lord have mercy I said so what's happening he said' nobody's got a girl in their team but You' I said send her on first practice I ran them till their guts were coming out we ran the first then I said run to doubles then I said run like you hit a triple run like you hit a uh in the park home running I said let's start over run the first do a double do a triple time I was done that girl was dragging she went her mom and said I don't want to be on this team I said glory to God brother wait we didn't even have to hit her with a baseball that was the next move ah some of you didn't like that and I still holy ghost filled but everybody here now this that we're in ain't just for boys or girls it's both men and women but we're all in one bodyx where he says there's neither male nor female but we're all one in Christ Jesus my wife's got to run your brother's wives got to run you women your husbands have got to everybody's got to run you're in the look and this why I say that if I give up my wife needs to keep running listen her salvation ain't tied to mine she's got an individual with Christ if I fall by the way side she can go on with Christ she's in this race herself come on now each one of us are running and we're running brother cuz you know why time's about over you realize brother said this thing would blend with eternity it's about over time is blending with eternity we're at the end of everything look at Martin Luther when God showed him the light he grabbed that baton brother he ran with his message now do you realize if Martin Luther could have lived long enough he'd believe John Wesley's message but he couldn't live long enough so when he was done running Wesley picked up the Paton and he had to run that's right and Wesley if he had lived long enough would have right on went on into the Pentecostal message but he couldn't live long enough so then they handed it off to the Pentecostals and the Pentecostals ran so far and if they' have kept running they'd have come right where we're at tonight now here's what I'm telling you that badon is in your hand listen to me folks there ain't nobody coming after you this is the group that's going to finish this race and all them back there can't be made perfect without us we've got to finish this race and we've got to finish it strong that's right listen they say oh brother I heard people say the other day brother brandom he he he pleas eyes pleas eyes I said y'all are you really that ignorant that you don't understand that brother Brandon preached Luther's message Wesley's message Pentecostal message he gleaned from a lot of those Brethren because there was truth all through the mes brother didn't come to bring a different message he come to take all the loose and tie up it don't bother me he quoted other men that means that God had truth even in their other [Applause] ages that light came that's right that fire came that ter of fire came and did what took all the Lucan down the made and tied it all up together and gave us a perfect word of God in this age we're running with this messag look how many years you said 52 years look how long brother Dale's ran brother Samuel de look how long he's ran with this message now I don't know how long he'll be here I hope he's here to Jesus comes but I don't know I don't know if I'd be here to Jesus comes but if God leaves him and here and takes me I want to finish strong I want to leave an example behind for others if he can do it I can do it but you notice what we're seeing now listen what we're seeing now hate to say it we're seeing less Runners absolutely yes sir I hate to say it but the further it goes y'all don't expect to get bigger right could get less look you can't look there's people I'd love to y'all don't have it here but I'd love to flip the pyramid upside down I'd love to I'd love for it to start out small and get wide but it don't it starts out wide and gets small gets to get into the minority all the time now I said the other day at our church I said you realize Peter preached one sermon Holy Ghost fill man one sermon day at Pentecost 3,000 Souls was added to the church it takes all us preachers together preach 3,000 sermons just get one Soul at it now very few coming now don't get mad we got more walking away and we got coming less Runners less Runners but there's still a group ain't going to quit running God got some people right here going to run all the way to Perfection you got a little bit of water I could have matter of fact it's sitting on your desk I I stole one out of that refrigerator he told me I could have it I just need this one my throat is dry can I have a couple more minutes few less less running I'll tell you why in just a second 7:26 give me about 15 minutes I can't preach all this tonight it's impossible hope I gave you something to think about all I know is what they had in that way Great Wide age we got it today same message Paul preached we got it right here tonight that ain't guess work we got the same Revelation if you brought the Apostle Paul back here tonight stood him in this pull pit he'd preach William Brown's message if you took William BR and put him in PA AG he wrote 13 books of the Bible he preached the same message Paul preached that's had no Church of God Boy tell said how in the world could you believe that men 2,000 years apart preach the same gospel I said CU you're looking at the two men I'm looking at the source they got it from I said that same P fire that came to Paul came to brother BR that's why they got the same Revelation they got it from the exact same Source sir believe that Cornerstone becomes yes headstone I I've used this from all over the world what is that I preach that your your church I a you you figured out what it is now didn't you I think you said the handkerchief last time that's a tiwel be more definitive it's a rag put in this pocket right what if I switch this rag to this pocket did I change the rag I just change the location from the left pocket to the right pocket if I take the Cornerstone down here and make it the headstone is it a different Stone no it's just a different but it's the same Stone the Cornerstone has now become The Headstone the alpha has become the Omega first met in last match identically the same he turned our hearts back to the faith of the apostolic fathers that's right we got that message but with the maturity to take this and run it to the Rapture to Perfection that's right now Paul in several places spoke of this race I'll just read them to you quickly 1 Corinthians 9:24 know you not they that run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain we ain't running just to be running n we got a purpose amen Galatians 5:7 you did run well who did handle you that should not obey the truth I won't get into it you know the history them judaizers coming at trying to mix law with Grace they do the same thing they try to mix legalism with Grace it don't work that's why people are getting out of the race they never got to Christ look rules is not going to hold people they've got to be born again young people if you don't get an experience with Christ this message will become a rule book to you and after a while you'll get tired of the rules and that old nature will drive you to the world you'll play along until you getting old enough to disobey without getting a whooping I told my boys all six of them I said you live in my house I know you ain't got no conviction so you're going to borrow mine till you get your own that's and I said if I don't I'll whip you till the fire alarm goes off bless God around my house we believed in capital punishment all right I'm kidding I'm kidding corporal punishment we didn't stick to this stuff is sticking her nose in a come on man I'd have love them days I had a daddy about Aaron size there son and when he hit you my daddy believed your brains were born low and the more you got whooped the higher your brains were the smarter you got amen man that size hitting you it didn't take a lot of licks to smarten you up hated to hear my daddy say son this hurts me as much as I want to say you ain't nothing but a lie I know this ain't hurting you as much as give me that belt we'll see if it hurt you as much as it does me took me in there one time caught me doing something well son I wouldn't do this if I didn't love you Daddy just hate me a while forget this love business y'all know what I'm talking about your daddy's a big man get a hold of you yes sir I press toward the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus look the great event is simply this it's a race amen right and there's only one way to get in it it's a race of faith brother B taught us the Christ mystery God reveal what is Faith yes what's the new birth it's the Revelation faith is a revelation what's the new birth a revelation of Jesus Christ personally revealed to you ain't that good God brings the Revelation right down to your heart can bypass everybody come right to you how didd he get to you brother Kanan he came to you that's right called you out of that legalist Holiness Church amen yes sir called me out of one of them too that's right had a preacher y'all know doctor well we called him doctor brother Le veale he called me one time he's crazy I don't mean that disrespectful just what he said when he called my wife said let me talk to luky dookie my wife said I think one of your uncles is on the phone she thought it was my uncle I went to phone I said who is this she said as said brother Le how you don't lookie doie I like what you talking about the man that wrote the church H book you called me ly dookie and what his question was did you come out of the Oneness Apostolic church I said yes sir he said how in the world you do that I said because God called me out that's the only way I came out because God called me he said there wasn't a lot of them that came out of that to this message it was all from all them other groups but very few from that Pentecost said that's where he called me from he like he was shocked brother I don't care where they are God call A Man Out of Hell if he has to if he's predestinated to see his messy got to get him he brought some of us out the low as hell there was and brought us to this message so I tell all people M all the time I don't care where your son is may be sitting in jailon now he ain't Beyond God's help your daughter might be in drug she ain't Beyond God's help God can get anybody anytime he wants [Applause] to and I like when God gets a hold of them rather than when I get a hold of them they don't last long when I get them that's right God gets in they last a long time my boy Jeremiah is he here tonight I don't know why he's not he live closer than anybody

iron my clothes I said you teach him how to iron clothes so she went there I said just go ask him and I'll tell you the truth I was hoping he said no cuz that's going to cost me $2,400 I didn't want him to go I didn't need him I don't need no chaperon I had brother beill another Brothers I don't need that boy that's a lot of money take it knucklehead with me she said but some reason she wanted him to go so she went and asked him now brother when I'm finish the story you'll know why God put on her heart to want her boy to go bill you were there brother Bill back there and she went back there and said Jeremiah would you like to go to South Africa with your daddy they had the same conversation about ironing clothes and she told him I'll teach you she come back and said he said he goes Lord have mercy I got on the line i' pulled up a ticket and I bought it and got him sitting right beside me both trips brother Bill we had to buy about four tickets he went with me first service we had brother Bill wasn't it's half the size of this church right here about to them poles maybe just two seats back Jeremiah sitting here with brother Mike hunas is with Bill on one side and brother bill on the other side I carried bills with me every went said I had Bill wi and build cart I said as long as I got these bills with me I'll never be broke always got bills I was in his office little office about like this and I was in there in the sermon that I had to preach brother wait I kid you not it just left me and man I instantly started shaking and you preachers still shake before y'all go to preach you better be glad you do that's right I started shaking I got down on my knees and said Lord I don't know what's happened I said but the message was burning me it's not on me I said what's going on and I kid you not an autal voice just something in my heart this I felt led to open the John 5 I opened John 5 started reading and I read where the angel come down and stirred the water right and I went out there and preached that whosoever will can come but not whensoever in other words you can only come when God calls the Angels got to stir if the angel don't start the water it's just water but the angel stirs the water it's supernatural then I started preaching that didn't I bill and all a sudden I heard somebody crying about Happ with that man look back and tears are rolling down Jeremiah's face come on I said surely not I kept preaching I cut that sermon off short said anybody here I don't know why that doesn't know Christ that would like to receive him oh Jeremiah's hands went up in South Africa that boy gave his heart to Christ Mama probably did just like sister Brandon when she went brought that Bible she was embarrassed when brother could but you realize of all the Bibles there was Sister Brandon was led to get to that Bible God was us to buy that Bible for Christmas for brother brandom that was the will of God right there L Ang you couldn't find word of God being worked out that boy gave his heart to the Lord we went back to the room I knelt down in the living room brother Bill him went to bed I knelt down in the living room put the coverage kind over my head and was just praying really I was thanking the lord for what he did in that service and then I felt somebody come behind me and I quickly pulled the cupboards back and Jeremiah was sitting on the couch tears rolling out of his face said what's wrong son he said Daddy tonight I surrendered my whole heart to the Lord Jesus I said well son you've been around me heard me preach you know what you got to do when we get home we'll B he said home Daddy I can't wait till we get home I got to be baptized now brother I knew God was at work some people want to put you on a schedule I get baptized six months down the road oh no God deals with you and you repent get to the water get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ God give you the Holy Ghost brother we that I called that Pastor said brother I don't know how to tell it's another pastor but I was preaching for that next morning I said I don't know how to say this but my I come to South AF my boy got saved he said really I said yeah he wants baptized well he said let's baptize him filled the pool up I went down there about 4 500 people there and I baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he has never been the same [Applause] God can he can call a preacher son or he can call a drug addict or a prostitute or anybody else he can call them by his grace and put him in this great race you know what I tell my boys when daddy's dead and gone you keep running with this message if God reveals it to you hey I'll say it if God reveals it to you there ain't a devil in hell that can take it out of you there ain't enough false prophets can take your eyes off this message if God ever reveals it to you but if somebody talks you in it somebody can talk you out of it but if God reveals it to you nobody will ever talk you out of it let me tell you why I said all that because it's personally revealed to you when God reveals it to you brother you're in this race and you got to run it it's in your hands you got to run this race now look I've seen it I hate to say it but now we're starting I said the other day called a preacher from South after call me said brother what's going on I said look brother brother brandom he witnessed Janice and jabas daythan Cordon bams witnessed all that right there at the time of the shook I said but you I hate to say it but we're starting to see that Judah Spirit raise up now kissing the door to the Rapture and going to the tribulation period I said yes sir that spirit's starting to be shown and we're seeing a great Falling Away taking place brother but While others are falling away boy I'm gripping it tired and I ever could cuz I know before falling before there can be a calling away there's got to be a falling away and if we're seeing a falling away that means that's fix to be a calling away he fix to take a bride home to Glory you got to get in it personally yes preachers are dropping out just close close friends of mine I mean it baffles you when you see that happen what in the world these men have preached this message and the truth is look this knowledge up here ain't going to hold you that's right it's got to get down in here right you you can't look you can run this wow but if you ain't ordained to be on that track by a new birth your legs are going to start wobbling I mean you can run for a while and you get on that curb and start coming on the other side brother your WS start wobbling if ain't no New Birth there but if there a new birther you'll keep right on moving with the word hold that Pon fall that light keep on running this race not just preachers ly we're shocked at the people we see fall away and we don't rejoice in it it's sad sad brother we don't rejoice in seeing people walk away it hurts us to see that happen but you can't run it without the new birth that's a little seemed like almost a paradox run with patience the race I don't even associate the word patience with running man when I think of running when I was a kid I ran one time from the law and Sunday was nothing patient about it me and my cousin boy never could outrun me but when we saw them four cop cars coming by the way they never did find us we ran we knew that neighborhood like the back of our hand we jumped fences and went through porches and everywhere ended up at the same house we started that they never did find us and we made 40 bucks off of that there was no patience about that some when you run you run but this is that word patience there is the word endurance right and here's another thing that word race look it up it's where we get the word agony it's conflict right and you're going to have a lot of it you're going to face it and when you face it it ain't that you've conquered everything it's just that now you can face everything that's something that holds you when you can't hold yourself that birth will hold you to Christ it'll give you a TI poost you see people fall around you you don't put your eyes on them put your eyes on Christ keep it there you keep running I wish I had more time good man rightness Shipwrecked beat jailed fought with beast at Ephesus stood for the word look at the what the man went through but he said I finished my course I fought a good fight hey I've run the race ain't nothing better than coming to the end and knowing ain't no trouble down at the river that's right I finish this thing strong right right yeah let me tell the story then I'll move to one more and I'll close when I was younger I still walk walk 3 to five miles a day walk little fast but I walk every now and then I run maybe a block I can't run like I used to run the other day I got some pain in my knee and I said now that's I said that's not supposed to be there but I run every now and then my daddy when I was young I ran the mile I played baseball and ran the mile and my time in Florida know it's hard to believe was under six minutes and it won the whole state of Florida and they wanted me to go to West Virginia run on the national but I had an All-Star game and I was never taken running over baseball but in that race the coach called me my own coach call me said said son this is what he said there's a black boy on that side and I already knew he is what my coach said you can't beat him just do your best well my dad was standing behind and heard that man say that and my dad's blood went to the top of his head he was mad hey hold up come here son and Daddy called me over said this what he said don't you listen to what he said that's right he said if he can't tell you how to win I'll tell you how to win I said Daddy how am I going to beat that guy he's fast dad said I don't care how fast he is I don't want you to beat him I want you to run on his heels he said you just patiently stay on his heels run three laps CU taking four said you run the first three and just stay on his Hill but don't you ever pass him just make him conscience that you're there he said that last lap you give it everything you got son been a lot of preachers give you false information but we've had Daddy come down this hour he's told us how to win this race hey you about listen to Daddy's instructions Malachi 4 brought Daddy's instructions to us taught us how to run this race you know I follow that boy for three Laps on his heels and at the whole time he's running he's do like this paying attention to me and the more he's turning his head the more he's ex is exting energy my daddy knew that I didn't know that I wouldn't had a clue about that I would have tried to stay beside him and beat him the whole time my dad said don't you do it stay on his that last lap I could hear my daddy give it give it everything you got son I took off I beat him by half of a lap he was whipped he didn't have no strength that coach over there his whole F only person scream for my daddy that's my boy brother daddy knows how to win this race I'm telling you there's something about Daddy's instructions you realize even when Jesus went down there he never said I'm about my mama's business I'm about my father's business hey this message is a father's business he come to bring us a message to finish this race and finish it [Music] strong let me give you one in closing got about four thing I only got 29 pages of notes so I'll skip to 28 let me tell you how you're going to win it when Paul wrote Hebrews 11 before he wrote Hebrews 12 he went through a whole line of people that ran by faith even the law before a law ever came he picked up Abraham that's right Abraham's for the law that's right Paul picked it up he said it I was alive without the law once that was Abraham law come send reviv that's Moses I died and then he brought you to Christ and no matter which men you took back there they all ended with Christ no matter what type you took it ended with Christ they were all parts of the body he was the head every one of them men was pointing of this man so after Paul preaches Hebrews 11 and he comes to Hebrews 12 he said looking not unto Abraham not to Moses not to B not to David not to looking under the greatest looking on the one they were all looking to looking unto Jesus the author the one that begin it and the finisher of your faith I don't matter who I look no no yes it does you better keep your eyes on Christ you say eyes you know can I tell One More Story he ain't here tonight I wish he was old Ben Bowen any of y'all know who Ben Bowen is that don't go to church with us anybody know Ben Bowen look him up on Facebook he's on there get a good look at him when I coached his daddy came to me he said brother Luke said uh you think Ben could play for you I said has he ever played ball he said no I said well bring him out he come out there and he's one of them guys that you give about three outs and a bat and say son you did good go sit down he couldn't hit the broadside of a barn that ain't no lie left-handed boy I worked with him all year long he batted every game never could hit the ball we was 110 come to 12th game and bases were loaded no joke two outs who come up brother Keith oh Ben I said dear Jesus it's over and I and I got a thought I I said time blue I called Ben over on third Baseline I caught him up close to me I said Ben everybody don't know what I'm saying to him this is what I said I said Ben your daddy told me you still sleep with your mama me said he told you I said yeah he told me everybody thinks I'm giving him a good baseball talk I said I promise to the Lord if you don't keep your eye on this ball and hit it I'm telling everybody this game you still sleep with your mama he said you wouldn't do it I said try me son brother way I never seen a kid more focused in all my life son I mean his eye was I said watch it out I've always talk watch it out of the hand watch out that boy was so focused brother waade I tell you the truth that kid hit that ball so far out there we scored won that game everybody's coming what did you say I said just between coaching didn't player I said I just T the just gave him a good talking to you know what he recognized don't care what you do you go out and drive tonight it's going to make a difference where your eyes are at you young people keep your eyes off the phone keep it on the road there's kids have lost their life because of distract that'd be a good message distractions makes a difference where you place your eyes nothing wrong with respecting preachers and different you should you should do that right but no matter what happens to anybody there's one man you better keep your eye on and that's the Lord Jesus Christ if you keep your eye on him you'll finish this race strong amen musicians come please if you would could we stand together and just ID

thinking that and we all kind of have a a little bit of athletic background but when you're running when you're running a a race especially a fourman relay yeah you put the best man at the end right you got your Pacers you got your starters but that last guy as soon as he grabs that baton he's got to make up time or he's got to keep the pace going and I believe that's what we are the prophet went off the scene he handed that baton to us that's right amen us he handed it to us and you know what he done he gave us all the training yes he gave us the best shoes he gave us the best message he gave us the best preachers he gave us the best Le he gave us the best song leaders and song musicians I don't hear any clapping this is the best and Paul is even the man that said let's run this race amen he's waiting on me and you he's waiting on me and you he's in that other dimension over there he's sitting he's waiting right when that call comes it's got to come from a bride amen the last Bon is a body change it's been handed to me and you what are we going to do with it do us brother luk said run and but run with patience you know you can run so fast you can trip and fall done that before you run so fast you can trip and fall that's not that's why I said run with patience right you pick your Pace that's right your pace may be faster than others you may Pace may be slower than others but I like what brother Luke said because we've been preaching on Statue of perfect man for a long period of time but that's the Running part we're at the Running part we're we're we're here where we can get it I appreciate my dad and the different ones and some of the older brother brother Mike hter not calling you old brother Mike but some of the old ones old DNS brother Luke there was a lot of there was a lot of brush in in the message Woods right you couldn't see a lot all they saw was a messenger and then there was all kind of doctrines went through that all kind of things and you couldn't see but praise God brother Mike my dad different ones the older ones they took the sword of the word and they cut that thing back and they cut us a trail so that we can finish this race that's just what I believe cuz I went through as a kid I went through all that you heard this one preach this one you had to follow this one you had to follow that one listen if you don't follow Christ you following the wrong person period period if you're not following Christ wrong person period I don't care you can put whatever name you want to in that that's right but as we follow but see said Paul says follow me as I follow Christ right so as brother Brandon follow Christ we're going to follow right in line amen and you know what he's even waiting on us he's waiting on us and I I I I sometimes brother Luke I think God maybe lets him look over in this dimension every once in a while not see the bad I don't want him to see that part the people leaving and all I want him to see a congregation that's worshiping God under the message of the hour under the final voice to the final age under her messenger that's right that's us am we do have something to say we have something to say and I believe we're saying it I believe we're taking this thing and we've got the right baton we've got the right race like brother Luke said you know you can get people that run a race and they'll get distracted and but if I'll promise you if you put your eye on on a certain spot as that little boy with a bicycle you know he said how'd you get through that he said well I didn't look down at the wheel right he said I look out there now when you're driving a car try it sometime you drive a car look straight down over your over your hood straight down you'll do this all the time but look out there amen look out see the prize when you see that prize we heading toward it we know what the prize is we know that so we're going to run to that prize and then we're going to run as brother said to a body change God bless you we love you thank you for all coming wish you could have come tomorrow and finish the rest of it but I know how that is I'm on a sermon tomorrow be 125 on
