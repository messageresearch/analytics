[10:43] lord so let's read about this tonight in
[10:45] joshua chapter 20.
[10:48] it says here the lord also spake unto
[10:50] joshua saying
[10:51] speak to the children of israel saying a
[10:53] point out for you cities of refuge where
[10:57] if i spake unto you by the hand of moses
[11:00] that the slayer that killeth any person
[11:02] unawares and unwittingly may flee
[11:05] thither and they shall be your refuge
[11:08] from the avenger of blood
[11:11] now we'll break this down here in just a
[11:12] little bit amen if you don't know if
[11:14] you're not understanding right now and
[11:16] when he that doth flee unto one of those
[11:19] cities shall stand at the entering of
[11:21] the gate of the city and shall declare
[11:24] his cause in the ears of the elders of
[11:26] that city they shall take him into the
[11:29] city unto them and give him a place that
[11:32] he may dwell among them
[11:34] and if the avenger of blood pursue after
[11:36] him then they shall not deliver the
[11:39] slayer up into his hand because he smote
[11:42] his neighbor unwittingly and hated him
[11:45] not before time
[11:46] and he shall dwell in that city until he
[11:49] stand before the congregation for
[11:51] judgment and until the death of the high
[11:54] priest that shall be in those days then
[11:57] shall the slayer return and come unto
[11:59] his own city and unto his own house
[12:02] unto the city from whence he fled
[12:05] and they appointed
[12:07] kiddish in galilee in mount neptali and
[12:11] shechem in mount ephraim and kurdish
[12:14] tharbha which is hebron in the mountain
[12:17] of judah and on the other side jordan by
[12:20] jericho eastward deyassan biezer in the
[12:23] wilderness upon the plane out of the
[12:25] tribe of reuben the the bible here is
[12:28] naming each one of these cities right
[12:30] here
[12:30] uh out of the travel reuben and raymond
[12:33] and gilead out of the tribe of god and
[12:35] golan and basian out of the tribe of
[12:37] manasseh
[12:38] these were the cities appointed for all
[12:40] the children of israel
[12:42] watch this for all the children of
[12:44] israel and for the stranger that
[12:46] sojourneth among them
[12:48] that whosoever killeth any person that
[12:50] unawares might flee thither and not die
[12:54] by the hand of the avenger of blood
[12:57] until he stood before the congregation
[13:00] amen may the lord have a blessing to
[13:02] read the word amen let's just bow our
[13:04] heads before we sit down our heavenly
[13:05] father we just thank you once again lord

[13:40] and so lord help us to get something
[13:41] father that would help us lord in our
[13:44] christian walk that would make us better

[14:10] amen i haven't i haven't started i had
[14:12] to take my coat off
[14:15] praise god
[14:18] amen so
[14:20] like i said i want to title this run to
[14:22] your city of refuge amen run to your
[14:25] city of refuge and
[14:27] and i i worded it this way your city of
[14:30] refuge because that's how the the bible
[14:32] here
[14:33] you can read about this city of refuge
[14:35] in in in different places in the word
[14:37] amen uh
[14:39] it's lo you can read it in the book of
[14:41] deuteronomy
[14:42] uh chapter 4 and also in the book of
[14:45] deuteronomy chapter 19
[14:47] as well as numbers chapter 35 and
[14:49] numbers chapter 35 is a more detailed
[14:52] look at the cities of refuge now
[14:55] maybe you've heard this uh you know what
[14:57] this is this is about but maybe some
[14:59] people don't know maybe some young
[15:01] people don't know about the cities of
[15:03] refuge
[15:04] and and it's so interesting that god
[15:07] amen no matter what law he puts into
[15:10] place
[15:11] he always has some some form of grace
[15:14] some form of mercy amen for some form of
[15:17] escape for each and every one of us amen
[15:20] there is a place tonight saying that you
[15:22] don't have to be sitting there wallowing
[15:24] in your sin
[15:25] you don't have to be sitting there
[15:26] wallowing in your condemnation you don't
[15:28] have to be sitting there wallering in
[15:30] what you did yesterday or what you did
[15:32] last week amen god has made a way for
[15:35] you to go and escape amen the slayer
[15:38] that's after you and we know who the
[15:40] slayer is spiritually amen our slayer is
[15:43] satan
[15:44] and and and and
[15:46] and really when we come into this world
[15:48] he has claims on you
[15:50] brother branham even brought it so far
[15:52] that is he is actually you're married to
[15:54] satan when you're when you don't have
[15:55] christ
[15:56] you're actually married to satan when
[15:58] you are not a christian amen
[16:01] you are married to him so he has full
[16:04] claims of you amen
[16:06] he has full claims on you and he is
[16:08] after you to destroy you
[16:10] he's not after you to help you
[16:12] he's not after you to give you a good
[16:13] job he's not after you to give you i
[16:15] mean if
[16:16] he will give you a good job if if it's
[16:18] going to make you stay out of church
[16:21] oh he'll give you a good job then oh
[16:23] this is a blessing
[16:26] this is a blessing you might say or you
[16:27] might think
[16:29] but the satan knows exactly what you do
[16:31] to hinder you in your christian walk
[16:34] he is out there to destroy the bible
[16:36] says he's there to destroy kill he's
[16:38] like a royal lion seeking who he he may
[16:41] uh eat with
[16:43] you know have lunch with
[16:45] have a picnic with
[16:47] no seeking who he may devour you are his
[16:51] lunch amen
[16:52] you are his dinner praise god and so he
[16:55] has full claims on us now
[16:57] and so in looking at at this city of
[17:00] refuge here praise god uh you know in
[17:03] today's news you know we hear a lot
[17:05] about the refugees you know refugees uh
[17:08] coming into into different countries we
[17:10] got a lot of them coming in right now
[17:12] matter of fact i'm even rethinking about
[17:14] doing mission trip now they're all
[17:15] coming here
[17:17] borders are just wide open
[17:19] like nothing's happening
[17:21] but
[17:22] but you know brother bam did say that
[17:24] you know the united states is going to
[17:26] end up being one of the most countries
[17:28] that's going to end up being one needs
[17:29] more missionaries and maybe that's
[17:31] that's where that gets fulfilled
[17:33] amen
[17:35] but um so a lot of refugees and what a
[17:38] refugee is is they're coming to cu to to
[17:41] they're they're going to another country
[17:43] to seek refuge or protection from the
[17:46] country that they're leaving from let's
[17:48] say they're leaving mexico and they come
[17:50] to the united states amen they're coming
[17:52] for a protection amen if something
[17:54] if their life is in danger their
[17:56] family's life is in danger you see and
[17:58] so that's what the the word refugee
[18:00] means now the word refuge amen the word
[18:02] refuge means a shelter a protection a
[18:06] safety
[18:07] a security
[18:08] an asylum
[18:10] a sanctuary a preservation safe keeping
[18:14] praise god now doesn't that sound like
[18:17] what our lord jesus christ is
[18:19] amen he is our shelter
[18:21] praise god he he is our protection
[18:24] i don't know of any better protection
[18:25] amen than our lord jesus christ praise
[18:27] god he is our safety he is our security
[18:31] amen he's got more security than your
[18:33] than your house alarm will ever have
[18:35] praise god he's got more security than
[18:37] your car alarm will ever have praise god
[18:39] more security than even the police out
[18:41] here could ever give you amen he is the
[18:43] security of securities amen now i don't
[18:46] know about asylum because asylum does
[18:48] have a negative connotation to it amen
[18:50] but he is our sanctuary
[18:53] praise god a sanctuary or a place where
[18:55] you you know a lot of people today they
[18:57] want to create their sanctuary and and
[18:59] they're there doing you know uh you know
[19:01] meditating and and burning candles and
[19:04] burning you know essential oils and
[19:06] that's their sanctuary you know
[19:08] you know and doing all this all this
[19:10] stuff you know whatever
[19:12] that's a sanctuary they're at peace
[19:14] see he is our peace
[19:16] we don't need to be doing that you know
[19:19] we just need to live and talk with him
[19:21] and read his word amen praise god we
[19:23] just need to we just need to abide with
[19:25] him amen and he abide with us praise god
[19:28] and he is our preservation he is our
[19:31] safe keeping another another uh uh
[19:33] definition is a condition of refuge a
[19:36] condition of being safe or sheltered
[19:39] from pursuit
[19:41] danger or trouble
[19:44] praise god
[19:45] a condition of being safe or shelter
[19:47] from pursuit danger or trouble
[19:49] praise the lord how many have been have
[19:50] been chased by a dog before oh yeah
[19:56] brother wade he knows what being chased
[19:58] by a dog is he's a mailman
[20:01] well i've i've had several times when
[20:03] i've been chased by a dog
[20:05] and let me tell you it's not fun
[20:07] it doesn't matter how
[20:09] big or small the dog is
[20:11] if the dog is showing his teeth and
[20:14] barking at you
[20:16] something i mean you get scared
[20:18] especially when you're younger now you
[20:20] know it gets to a point where you know
[20:22] what you just you know kick them and
[20:23] they'll calm down but
[20:25] a lot of animal activists wouldn't like
[20:27] that
[20:29] i remember one time i was going down uh
[20:31] minding my own business back in south
[20:33] carolina and here i was just walking
[20:35] down the street getting ready to go home
[20:36] and here and all of a sudden this dog
[20:39] just jumps out from this house it was
[20:41] loose it was about mid-sized dog and he
[20:43] starts barking and so as i'm walking i
[20:46] just
[20:46] stop i'm just there
[20:50] i mean i can go
[20:51] i can go this way or i can go that way
[20:54] but the barking of a mad dog i mean it
[20:56] it it it freezes you you see and he's
[20:59] just there barking and i knew when he
[21:01] was showing those teeth oh my
[21:03] and so the only thing i could do was
[21:05] take off
[21:07] i took off and here i see the dog market
[21:10] behind me
[21:11] and
[21:12] i got home
[21:13] i knew that if i get to my shelter amen
[21:16] to my place of refuge i'd be safe from
[21:18] the dog amen luckily the dog he got
[21:21] tired of chasing me i can't believe i
[21:22] was out running the dog
[21:24] amen i outran the dog
[21:26] you don't know what you can do when you

[22:58] that's what he did to jesus amen jesus
[23:01] he said he the bible said that when he
[23:02] tempted jesus amen he fled for a season
[23:06] he came back but jesus by jesus being
[23:10] the word amen there was no match for him
[23:12] amen there was no match for the avenger
[23:14] praise god see satan thought that he had
[23:16] claims on jesus amen and he was talking
[23:19] to his creator yeah
[23:22] he was talking to his creator right
[23:23] there praise god
[23:25] amen so that is what a refuge means amen
[23:29] a place of safety praise god and so when
[23:31] looking here at this at this book of
[23:34] the book of joshua and like i said you
[23:35] can read this in detail in numbers
[23:37] chapter 35
[23:39] and and and what it was it was in the
[23:42] law in the law of moses amen god's
[23:44] commandments
[23:46] god if some if a man was going to take
[23:49] took the life of another man or killed
[23:51] another man or murdered another man
[23:54] intentionally or with hate
[23:56] amen or or or did it you know did it
[23:58] intentionally
[24:00] that man's life was supposed to be taken
[24:02] as well by the others by
[24:05] by others so it was an eye for an eye
[24:08] tooth for a tooth you see and that was
[24:11] that was the law of god you see you
[24:13] might ask
[24:14] why is it that god allowed that that way
[24:16] it was because life was so precious to
[24:18] god amen
[24:20] the life was so precious to god that if
[24:22] you took another man's life and it was
[24:24] in so much that even if an animal would
[24:26] take a man's life
[24:28] that animal was supposed to be die it
[24:30] was to die as well
[24:32] amen
[24:34] animal activists wouldn't like that
[24:35] either
[24:37] but that's what god said
[24:38] [Music]
[24:40] but now god made a way that if a man
[24:44] unintentionally took the life of another
[24:47] man
[24:48] or accidentally killed another man and
[24:50] it wasn't his intention to do it there
[24:52] was a way that god made made a way of
[24:55] escape for that man to not be killed as
[24:58] well and brother brandon brought it this
[25:00] way he said that let's pretend that
[25:01] there was two men that they were they
[25:03] were in the woods and they were chopping
[25:05] wood and they had their their axes and
[25:08] they were chopping wood and all of a
[25:09] sudden the axe head comes off of the of
[25:11] one of their axe and hits the other man
[25:14] in the head and kills him you see
[25:17] now nobody saw what had happened only he
[25:21] knew what had happened and he knew that
[25:23] he did not do it intentionally he did
[25:26] not kill that man intentionally but what
[25:28] but according to the law he knew that
[25:30] that person's father or that or that
[25:33] person's son or that person's uncle or
[25:35] the they had the rights to kill that man
[25:39] whether he did it intentionally or not
[25:41] unless he ran to a city of refuge
[25:45] unless he ran to the closest city of
[25:48] refuge
[25:49] praise god and so the best thing that
[25:51] that man could do at that moment was
[25:53] take and run to the closest city of
[25:55] refuge because as soon as the family
[25:57] would find out that their father was
[25:59] dead that they didn't have their their
[26:01] brother was dead or or the hu or husband
[26:04] was dead or a wife was dead or whatever
[26:06] amen they were after that person
[26:09] because according to the law they had
[26:11] the rights to go do that
[26:13] an eye for a knife tooth for a tooth
[26:16] amen and so what would happen is that
[26:18] this man would go and man he'd start
[26:20] running to the city of refuge as fast as
[26:22] he could
[26:23] and he would get there and the people of
[26:25] the city amen they would take him and
[26:27] then they were and he would he would
[26:29] explain their case to him and say listen
[26:31] i i shed innocent blood i didn't
[26:33] intentionally kill this man and they're
[26:35] after me and they would let him in but
[26:37] they would pl they would also they they
[26:39] were levites in there and they were they
[26:42] were man of wisdom that they would look
[26:43] at his case and they would judge
[26:46] righteously whether he unintentionally
[26:48] or intentionally killed that man or not
[26:51] and so it's interesting that it was
[26:52] levites they were in those cities
[26:54] because in all 48 of the cities and you
[26:56] can go back and read all of this in
[26:58] those cities there were levites those
[26:59] cities belong to levites
[27:01] and so
[27:02] levite priests and so
[27:04] that man was safe
[27:06] and that man could stay there no and no
[27:09] matter if that if the if the if the
[27:11] avenger would come hey give me that man
[27:14] he's he he killed my my husband or he
[27:16] killed my brother or whatever
[27:19] he could not do anything to him because
[27:20] he was in safety
[27:22] amen he was in that city of refuge there
[27:24] was nothing that could be done praise
[27:25] god and so you could just look at this
[27:28] saints and it's just it it
[27:30] it types christ perfectly saints
[27:33] it types christ amen because some of us
[27:36] sometimes say and it and this has
[27:38] happened to me amen sometimes instead of
[27:41] us going amen to where we need to go
[27:43] amen if we falter if we fail and we run
[27:46] and we need to run is to christ amen not
[27:49] back to the world not back to the things
[27:52] that led you to do what you need what
[27:54] you did amen but run to christ run to
[27:56] the one that can lead you amen that can
[27:59] that can safely shelter you that can
[28:01] forgive your sins
[28:03] amen that can give you peace in the
[28:05] midst of your condemnation amen but what
[28:07] do we do sometimes
[28:09] amen we waller in our sin i'm like well
[28:13] i might as well just keep going
[28:15] amen and that'll never work you know
[28:17] what's going to happen you're going to
[28:18] die
[28:20] what if the man that stayed right there
[28:22] amen that accidentally killed that man
[28:24] if he said well i'll just wait just a
[28:26] little bit longer you know
[28:28] he was going gonna die
[28:31] he was gonna die
[28:33] well i mean what if he said what if he
[28:34] said well i mean you know uh i don't
[28:37] like that city over there i think i'll
[28:39] just go over here you know uh he was
[28:42] gonna die
[28:44] he was going to die
[28:46] because that wasn't the word of god
[28:48] that was his city of refuge that was
[28:50] where he was supposed to go to be
[28:52] protected amen
[28:54] well if he said if he said well i i you
[28:56] know i'll i'll just go i'll just go
[28:58] later or or or i'll just uh you know
[29:01] just make some sort of excuse amen or
[29:03] i'll run to the baptist church or i'll
[29:05] run to the pentecostal church well i'll
[29:07] just go to church amen i'll just i'll be
[29:10] a good christian and you have not run to
[29:13] that city of refuge
[29:14] amen or
[29:16] i'll just i'll just be a good brother
[29:17] and sister i'll shake the brothers hands
[29:19] at church the sisters hands i'll smile
[29:21] at them i'll
[29:22] i'll look like a christian and you have
[29:24] not run to the
[29:26] refuge amen you're going to die
[29:30] because our refuge and our shelter is in
[29:33] christ amen it's not in anything else
[29:36] it's not in another church it's not in
[29:38] another system brother wade is not your
[29:40] refuge brother dell can't be your refuge
[29:42] i can't be your refuge no ministers here
[29:44] can be a refuge the only refuge is in
[29:46] christ jesus amen your mom and dad can't
[29:48] be a refuge amen nobody else can rep
[29:52] amen sometimes some people even had
[29:55] our last president as their refuge
[29:57] and you see how that went
[30:02] and some people even have our current
[30:04] president as their refuge and you see
[30:05] how that's going yeah the bible says
[30:08] that cursed is the man who trusts in man
[30:12] you can't trust anything else outside of
[30:14] christ you can't trust anything else
[30:16] outside of this word amen praise god i
[30:19] don't know where i could find peace like
[30:21] the peace that i find in christ i don't
[30:23] know where i can find joy like the joy
[30:24] that i find in christ i don't know where
[30:26] i can find amen have a good time like
[30:29] the good time that i can have in christ
[30:31] praise god that is the best time i've
[30:33] ever had
[30:35] when i thought i was having a good time
[30:37] when i was out in the world hey man the
[30:38] next day i was i was sick
[30:41] throwing up
[30:43] i thought i was having a good time
[30:46] i was then i'm told the next day
[30:48] throwing up and oh god headache
[30:52] that's not a good time young people
[30:54] so if if your heart is long longing for
[30:58] things like that i hope it's not
[31:00] let me just be real with you
[31:02] if your heart is longing for oh my if i
[31:04] could just
[31:06] if i knew what it was like to be in a
[31:07] club and not oh my and and just do all
[31:10] that stuff you know and
[31:12] and wear my my shorts all the way up to
[31:15] here and show off my body and and and
[31:18] guys you know just uh
[31:20] you know what they do you see it all in
[31:23] you you even see it out in the people
[31:24] out here
[31:25] i'm gonna tell you that looks all
[31:27] tantalizing and it looks good and it
[31:29] looks very not but let me tell you that
[31:30] it comes with consequences
[31:32] everything has consequences
[31:35] everything has consequences so you think
[31:37] oh my alcohol is great
[31:40] one beer is good amen but then it'll
[31:41] turn into two beers then it'll turn into
[31:44] three next thing you know you're you're
[31:46] slapped drunk amen and a man is right
[31:48] there waiting to rape you if you're not
[31:50] careful
[31:51] you see what it leads to
[31:52] because i've seen it i've seen it in the
[31:55] world that i lived in
[31:57] so it's nothing it's nothing pretty like
[31:59] the picture like the like what the
[32:01] slayer satan would portray it to you
[32:04] it's not that it's not that way
[32:07] amen
[32:08] it's not pretty praise god my goodness i
[32:10] got off the house
[32:12] somebody made needed amen
[32:15] but aren't you thankful that there is a
[32:17] place that you can run for safety
[32:19] amen you don't need to go back you know
[32:21] when when we were depressed out in the
[32:23] world what happened amen those of us who
[32:24] lived out in the country and and here in
[32:26] the south what did they do they'd go
[32:28] listen to country music
[32:31] i lost my my dog i lost my wife my truck
[32:34] done died and and and uh
[32:38] and you're there with that same spirit
[32:39] you know just feeding off the same
[32:41] spirit and it's all over you i don't
[32:43] lost my dog i don't lost my wife
[32:46] there's a tear in my beard cause i'm
[32:48] crying for you dear
[32:50] [Laughter]
[32:52] i know
[32:53] you see it's the same spirit
[32:55] i remember i remember
[32:57] and even those who you know i used to
[32:58] listen to hip-hop and all that
[33:00] and when you wanted to feel like you
[33:02] were you were you know you were powerful
[33:04] and you you know you had the upper hand
[33:06] over people and all that kind of stuff
[33:07] what do you do you listen to hip-hop you
[33:09] listen to rap you listen to all that all
[33:11] that kind of stuff that makes you feel
[33:13] like or where you want to have a upper
[33:14] hand over women you listen to hip-hop
[33:17] you listen to rap because that's the
[33:18] that's the spirit behind that music
[33:21] i remember a brother one time he was
[33:23] telling me that he was getting ready to
[33:25] mug a a man or
[33:28] or he was going to commit some sort of
[33:30] crime this was before he became a
[33:32] christian and he said brother i remember
[33:33] i was in the car i was planning
[33:35] everything out and i was in my car and i
[33:38] was i was there i was listening to
[33:39] gangster rap i was just prepping myself
[33:42] amen prepping my mind so that i can go
[33:44] ahead and do that
[33:47] you
[33:48] those things prep your mind so that you
[33:51] can go do what you think that you're not
[33:53] so that's why we have to be careful with
[33:55] the music that we hear you think you
[33:57] think it's just nagging at you but let
[33:59] me tell you we've been through that
[34:02] each and every one of us we've we've
[34:04] been through that i know what it's like
[34:05] i know what i've been through all kinds
[34:07] of music and
[34:09] and and let me tell you if you're not
[34:11] careful it will cause you to do things
[34:13] that you think that you would never do
[34:16] because why satan is the satan was this
[34:20] was the second uh created
[34:22] this next to god most important next to
[34:24] god and what he was the the one who was
[34:27] directing the choir up in heaven
[34:30] he was the song leader
[34:31] so he knows all about music so anything
[34:34] that is outside of of good godly music
[34:37] that makes you think about god if it's
[34:39] outside of that it's not of god
[34:42] it's of the slayer of satan
[34:46] anything that's causing you a man to to
[34:48] cheat on your wife anything that's
[34:49] causing you a man to think lustful
[34:51] thoughts to do smoke weed to do all that
[34:53] stuff do you think it comes from god
[34:56] it can't it's not of god amen
[34:59] it's of satan it's of the slayer and so
[35:03] and so if you run back to those things
[35:06] amen instead of you running to christ
[35:09] praise god
[35:11] that's right you're just going to be
[35:13] wallering in there
[35:17] and you're going to die
[35:19] because you're not under your city or
[35:21] refuge amen
[35:23] praise god amen
[35:25] so these cities are refuge amen we're
[35:27] for everyone
[35:29] the bible says there in numbers chapter
[35:30] 35 verse 15 these six cities shall be a
[35:34] refuge both for the children of israel
[35:36] and for the stranger and for the
[35:38] sojourner among them that everyone that
[35:40] killeth any person unawares
[35:43] that they didn't know may flee theater
[35:46] so it's just not just for the for the
[35:47] message believer
[35:49] it's not just for it's not just for for
[35:51] you amen it's for everyone the bible
[35:53] says whosoever will amen let him run
[35:56] amen the bible says in john chapter 3
[35:58] verse 16 that for god so loved the world
[36:01] that he gave his only begotten son that
[36:03] whosoever shall believeth on him should
[36:06] not perish but have everlasting life
[36:09] you might think oh my i can't live up to
[36:11] that to the life of of of brother so and
[36:13] so or sister so and so but let me tell
[36:15] you he's saying whosoever will anybody
[36:18] could run to the city of refuge anybody
[36:21] didn't have to be an israelite didn't
[36:23] have to be a message believer anybody
[36:25] could run to the city of to to that city
[36:28] of refuge
[36:29] and christ was right there with open
[36:30] arms the people were right there with
[36:33] open arms ready to receive
[36:35] because that's what that city was made
[36:36] for that's why christ is there
[36:39] he's not there gonna he's not gonna be
[36:40] there to condemn you he's not gonna be
[36:42] there to add more more more hindrance to
[36:45] your life than you what you already have
[36:47] amen he is right there to give you
[36:49] exactly what you need praise god
[36:52] amen now jesus he
[36:54] he he treats everyone the same
[36:57] amen amen you know in this in this day
[36:59] then time that we live and amen
[37:02] everybody feels there's people out there
[37:04] they're they're saying i you know i
[37:06] don't feel equal you know and i don't
[37:08] feel you know that uh it doesn't matter
[37:10] to him amen no matter what the color no
[37:13] matter what the gender amen to god
[37:15] everybody's the same that's right amen
[37:17] and he will receive him just the same
[37:19] praise god the only thing is is that you
[37:22] need to run to him praise the lord you
[37:24] need to run to him
[37:26] matthew 11 28 tells us amen jesus said
[37:28] come unto me all that are weary and
[37:30] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[37:34] amen you can't find rest anywhere else
[37:37] but in christ
[37:38] amen in our city of refuge praise the
[37:41] lord
[37:42] amen you know we're just getting i'm
[37:44] just getting uh uh uh i'm getting uh

[37:59] just just practicing getting things
[38:00] getting things going
[38:02] but uh it's okay no worries
[38:05] it'll be it'll be
[38:06] ten times harder down there
[38:09] no acs either
[38:11] now let's look at these cities of refuge
[38:13] here for just a moment amen there was
[38:15] three cities the bible says there were
[38:17] three cities uh
[38:19] within canaan within canaan and then
[38:21] three cities outside of canaan now here
[38:24] are the city names we were reading them

[38:30] kadesh means kadesh means a holy place
[38:34] amen shechem shechem was another city
[38:37] and it means back or shoulder
[38:39] praise the lord amen and
[38:41] the bible says that the shoulder will be
[38:43] upon his the government will be upon his
[38:45] shoulder amen
[38:46] hebron amen means association

[38:56] with you
[38:57] amen but you if you if you're if you're
[39:00] afraid of of of of
[39:02] you you dissociate dissociate or uh with
[39:06] anybody that that that is a christian or

[39:23] and raymeth and gilead rameth means
[39:25] heights

[40:11] places
[40:12] they were set on high they were not
[40:14] secret they were they were not anything
[40:16] secret anybody could see them from far
[40:18] off as a matter of fact they even say uh

[42:32] condemnation
[42:34] and we don't want to confess that we did
[42:36] wrong we don't want to do amen but
[42:39] all you got to do is repent praise god
[42:41] now here's some things that the bible
[42:42] says in regards to
[42:44] god being our refuge
[42:46] in proverbs chapter 18 verse 10 the
[42:48] bible says the name of the lord is the
[42:50] strong tower
[42:51] amen the righteous run to it and are
[42:54] safe
[42:55] praise god amen second samuel chapter 22
[42:58] verse 3 my god is my rock in whom i take
[43:02] refuge
[43:03] my shield and the horn of my salvation

[43:10] savior you save me from violence

[44:04] deliverer he is my shield in whom i take
[44:07] refuge who subdues peoples under me

[44:17] i didn't see a pop singer as his refuge
[44:20] he didn't see a movie star as his refuge
[44:22] he didn't see a president as his refuge
[44:24] amen he saw god as his refuge and he
[44:26] didn't have the holy ghost how much more
[44:28] us who have the holy ghost amen instead
[44:30] of looking out here to the world look to
[44:32] god look to the word look to who really
[44:35] is our refuge and then he'll be able to

[44:44] correct this in my life amen who are you
[44:46] running to for shelter
[44:48] amen

[44:57] god has eternal shelter
[44:59] that roof never breaks amen those
[45:01] windows never break amen that door never
[45:04] amen it's all perfect praise god amen
[45:09] and the people there
[45:11] are people of confidence if they have
[45:13] the holy ghost
[45:14] in that city
[45:16] these people who you can trust
[45:19] if they have the holy ghost
[45:22] because there could be people in the
[45:23] city
[45:25] and may maybe not be people of
[45:26] confidence
[45:28] amen but there are people there there
[45:30] were people there in that city who were
[45:31] supposed to be judges

[57:08] sacrifice that he made that we can
[57:10] actually go free praise god
[57:13] that we can actually be free
[57:15] amen but anything else outside of christ
[57:18] is not freedom
[57:19] it's slavery
[57:22] praise god
[57:23] anything outside of christ is not
[57:25] freedom
[57:26] amen
[57:27] but if the slayer shall at any time

[57:32] time in other words the man that
[57:34] accidentally killed the other man if the

[58:03] little bit
[58:04] all right guess what this was going to
[58:06] happen
[58:07] watch what it says verse 27 and the
[58:09] revenger of blood find him in other
[58:11] words the man that was trying to kill

[58:20] borders of the city of his refuge and
[58:22] the revenger of blood kill the slayer
[58:25] he shall not be guilty of blood
[58:28] in other words the one that was trying

[58:32] and if he finds him outside of the city
[58:34] according to the law he had the right to
[58:36] continue
[58:37] so it does not matter how long you've
[58:40] been in church saints

[58:57] church doesn't matter if you teach
[58:58] sunday school
[58:59] it doesn't matter if you preach
[59:01] if you get outside of christ amen
[59:04] satan is a satan has the right to take
[59:07] you that's right
[59:08] because you're outside of god's
[59:10] protection
[59:11] you're outside of his refuge
[59:13] amen
[59:14] praise god
[59:15] so that man could come back and kill
[59:17] that man
[59:19] verse 28 because
[59:20] watch he should have remained in the
[59:22] city of his refuge
[59:24] until the death of the high priest
[59:29] but after the death of the high priest
[59:31] the slayer shall return into the land of
[59:33] his possession
[59:35] amen
[59:36] you stay where christ is
[59:39] don't get outside of christ amen
[59:42] amen young and old amen stay in christ
[59:45] especially more at this hour that we're
[59:47] living in we got we're living in a crazy
[59:49] world out here today
[59:51] amen where up is down and down is up
[59:55] where a man is a woman and a woman is a
[59:57] man and
[59:58] whatever more in between
[1:00:00] they don't even know anymore
[1:00:04] saw one yesterday my wife were out
[1:00:06] eating you know it was her birthday
[1:00:07] yesterday and we were out eating and
[1:00:09] walked out of the restaurant and i
[1:00:11] looked over there
[1:00:13] i told her you know i couldn't tell that
[1:00:15] i was a man or a woman
[1:00:17] but i knew something was funny
[1:00:22] first first first thing i thought was
[1:00:24] that's a man
[1:00:26] and i told my wife i said you know what
[1:00:28] i think the first inkling that that you
[1:00:30] get about a person whether you don't
[1:00:33] know if it's a man or a woman amen
[1:00:34] that's probably what they are
[1:00:37] because
[1:00:38] i mean the human
[1:00:40] you know we were created i mean god
[1:00:42] created us in a are we're perfect in the
[1:00:45] way he created us
[1:00:47] our instincts and and the things amen
[1:00:51] and we have that first instinct
[1:00:52] something is wrong that's probably you
[1:00:54] that's probably what it is
[1:00:56] you're not sure if it's a man or a woman
[1:00:58] but your first instinct that's a man it
[1:01:00] probably is a man
[1:01:03] all right let me get off of that maybe
[1:01:04] we might get shut down by youtube
[1:01:08] they're just shutting everything down
[1:01:09] now
[1:01:10] you say anything about things like this
[1:01:12] or all kinds of i mean you get you get
[1:01:14] your channel shut off
[1:01:17] all right
[1:01:19] praise god but because he should have
[1:01:21] remained in the city of his refuge until
[1:01:23] the death of the high priest amen
[1:01:25] stay in christ saints amen
[1:01:28] you say you might say well i've never
[1:01:30] taken a life
[1:01:32] you know i've never killed anybody i
[1:01:34] never murdered anybody
[1:01:36] amen i've never done those things
[1:01:40] amen but how do you talk about your
[1:01:42] brother
[1:01:43] how do you talk about your sister
[1:01:46] what are the thoughts that go through
[1:01:47] your mind about your brothers and your
[1:01:49] sisters
[1:01:50] how do you how do you talk to how do you
[1:01:53] talk about them because the way you talk
[1:01:55] about them
[1:01:56] either hurts or helps their influence
[1:02:00] and when you're hurting somebody's
[1:02:02] influence
[1:02:03] amen you're killing them
[1:02:06] that's what brother branham said
[1:02:09] amen so we've all been guilty the bible
[1:02:11] says that all of us like sheep have gone
[1:02:14] astray we're all sinners we have we have
[1:02:16] sinned we've done wrong amen
[1:02:19] we've all done wrong
[1:02:21] whether you think you did or not
[1:02:25] we've all lied
[1:02:27] we've all stole something we've all
[1:02:29] cheated we've all we have all done
[1:02:31] something
[1:02:33] wrong to sin against our lord jesus
[1:02:36] christ
[1:02:37] amen
[1:02:40] and every time listen to me young people
[1:02:43] every time that you just continue in
[1:02:46] wallowing into your sin and just stay
[1:02:49] there and don't come and run to your
[1:02:50] city of refuge
[1:02:52] it's just like you just sitting there
[1:02:54] continuing
[1:02:55] pounding those nails in jesus's hands
[1:02:59] just keep nailing him to the cross you
[1:03:01] say i never nailed jesus to the cross
[1:03:03] but what put jesus on the cross was our
[1:03:05] sins
[1:03:06] and our iniquities so if you continue to
[1:03:09] stay in your wallering of sin and in
[1:03:11] your in your life and in in what you're
[1:03:14] doing instead of doing what you're
[1:03:15] supposed to do running to christ running
[1:03:17] to him amen you are sitting there
[1:03:20] continually nailing him on the cross
[1:03:23] nailing his feet on the cross
[1:03:25] you're putting him
[1:03:26] into an open shame again
[1:03:29] praise god
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:32] so we don't want to do that
[1:03:34] because it's our it's been our lives
[1:03:36] it's been our lusts it's been our our
[1:03:38] our those things amen it's those little
[1:03:40] foxes that spoil the vine the bible says
[1:03:43] it's not a murder
[1:03:45] i know none of us have murdered anybody
[1:03:47] here i hope not
[1:03:50] but there's no big sin or little sin
[1:03:52] before god
[1:03:54] the murderer
[1:03:56] physical murderer gets just as much
[1:03:58] punishment as the one that kills
[1:04:00] verbally
[1:04:02] if they don't repent amen
[1:04:07] yeah to god it's that way amen amen
[1:04:11] we look at the uh
[1:04:13] i'll finish with this with this example
[1:04:15] these two examples we see when the
[1:04:16] children of israel were running amen
[1:04:18] from the from the slayers of the egypt
[1:04:20] egyptians amen
[1:04:22] when they were in god's will
[1:04:24] amen they were following his will they
[1:04:26] were running towards the where they were
[1:04:28] supposed to run following their prophet
[1:04:30] amen obeying the word amen guess what
[1:04:32] god did to the man slayer to the to the
[1:04:35] to the ones that were chasing him those
[1:04:37] egyptians he killed him the bible the
[1:04:40] bible says that this day you will see
[1:04:42] these egyptians no more amen amen
[1:04:46] praise god when you are in god's will
[1:04:48] you when you are in god's will you will
[1:04:50] not see that temptation in your life
[1:04:52] anymore
[1:04:53] you will not see that i mean the
[1:04:55] temptation will come
[1:04:58] the temptation will come but you won't
[1:05:00] easily fall into it
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:04] you'll have something to fight with
[1:05:08] you're not alone

[1:05:11] temptation
