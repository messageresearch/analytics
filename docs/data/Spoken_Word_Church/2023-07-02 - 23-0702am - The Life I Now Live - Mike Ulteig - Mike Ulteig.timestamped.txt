[45:38] well it's good to be standing up here
[45:41] alive
[45:44] and some of you don't even know it but
[45:47] you probably come closer to
[45:49] crossing the portals of time than I have
[45:52] but God was with you and spared you
[45:56] you know there's no telling how many
[45:58] times
[46:00] that death has come to our gates and
[46:03] knocking at the door
[46:04] God has forbidden to come in amen
[46:08] so it's I'm glad to be here
[46:12] throw my shoulder to the to the wheel
[46:15] with
[46:16] brother Samuel and
[46:18] and brother Wade amen and all of you and
[46:21] I enjoyed the service last night glad
[46:24] you was here this morning I didn't know
[46:26] Hallelujah you know how those things are
[46:28] going to turn out but God's grace
[46:32] just real glad to have my wife with me
[46:35] been up here a lot of times without her
[46:38] and
[46:39] you know when you when you travel even
[46:42] States or overseas you know people want
[46:45] to see your wife more than they want to
[46:47] see you
[46:50] and you know I'm the same way I always
[46:53] want to meet somebody's somebody's wife
[46:56] you know it's just I don't know there's
[46:58] just something about that and sister
[47:00] Debbie we've been knowing her for years
[47:03] back in the 80s and she's with us this
[47:06] morning we're just really glad to have
[47:08] her so that's the crowd we brought you
[47:10] know so glad you had extra seats for us
[47:14] [Laughter]
[47:17] praise the Lord
[47:19] [Music]
[47:21] Let's uh let's read a scripture and then
[47:23] I'll let you be seated
[47:27] I want to turn to Galatians chapter 2.
[47:32] and uh
[47:34] I guess we'll read verses 19 and 20.
[47:42] for I through the law
[47:46] am dead to the law
[47:47] [Music]
[47:49] that I that word that is always an
[47:52] important word when you read it because
[47:54] that is kind of like a conclusion of
[47:58] what's just been said
[47:59] and and what's just been said is maybe
[48:03] in an event or something that has a
[48:06] purpose to it
[48:07] I opened the door
[48:10] that I might go into the kitchen you
[48:13] know
[48:14] and so this word that is important he
[48:18] said for the I through the law am dead
[48:22] to the law that
[48:25] I might live now that's always a
[48:27] contrast death in life amen you know I'm
[48:31] glad that I'm dead so that I can live
[48:34] amen
[48:38] so uh we'll be glad when we cross the
[48:42] portals
[48:44] that we might live
[48:46] in Clarity without a veil
[48:51] that I might live
[48:53] unto God
[48:55] not onto myself no sir self-purpose self
[48:59] needs
[49:00] you know but that I might live for God
[49:04] Amen and he said how can you love me and
[49:07] not love my children
[49:09] so then to live for him is to live for
[49:13] one another you know it's easy to live
[49:16] for God he's up here somewhere you know
[49:19] the Holy Spirit but sometimes we fail
[49:22] to live for one another and that's the
[49:25] truth that's what God really wants us
[49:27] and that's that's the simplest but it's
[49:29] the hardest because in order for you to
[49:32] live for somebody else you've got to
[49:35] take and put yourself out of the way and
[49:37] it's that's always hard to do
[49:39] sometimes we serve others for reward or
[49:43] for something for ourselves
[49:45] you know and
[49:47] God's love God's work is free
[49:52] it's without an ulterior purposes
[49:55] it's flowing from a well like an
[49:58] Artesian well amen there's something
[50:00] down deep a pressure that's pushing it
[50:03] up
[50:06] verse 20 and this is where we want to
[50:09] maybe the Lord willing to take a text
[50:13] yes Lord and here we are again we're
[50:15] dying already
[50:18] I am crucified with Christ
[50:21] nevertheless Christ
[50:24] nevertheless I live
[50:27] yet not I
[50:30] but Christ liveth in me amen and the
[50:35] life which I now live in the flesh
[50:39] and that's not after the flesh this is
[50:43] in the flesh
[50:45] I live by the faith
[50:47] of the son of God
[50:50] Who Loved Me
[50:52] and gave himself
[50:54] for me
[50:56] as we bow our heads
[50:59] those gracious Heavenly Father were just
[51:03] so glad to be here this morning
[51:07] that you granted all of us Lord another
[51:09] opportunity another day
[51:12] that we might learn of you that we might
[51:15] get to know you
[51:17] and Lord to understand you and your word
[51:20] in a greater depth a greater way
[51:24] and Lord you just know I'm just standing
[51:26] here this morning not certain
[51:29] as to which way
[51:31] I should go so we're we're asking you
[51:34] for for divine leadership yes in every
[51:38] one of our hearts and Minds this morning
[51:42] that you might anoint us that you might
[51:45] break any yoke any Fetter that would
[51:47] hinder us any thought
[51:49] anything that we're
[51:51] facing or challenges Lord
[51:55] may we set them aside
[51:57] and set at your feet Lord and may you
[52:01] speak to us may you inspire us Lord
[52:05] that you might reveal to us
[52:08] yourself
[52:10] your word and your way
[52:13] and father may you bless each one that's
[52:16] come this morning
[52:17] bless our gathering together and bless
[52:20] the reading of your word we ask in Jesus
[52:22] Christ's name
[52:24] amen you may be seated
[52:27] so I guess we'll take from this a text
[52:32] the life I now live
[52:35] and uh
[52:39] brother Wade already preached the
[52:41] message to me because he didn't already
[52:44] preached it in several parts you know
[52:47] so uh it wouldn't be anything new amen
[52:50] but Paul's speaking here and
[52:54] this is about 30 years or so after
[52:57] Paul's converted
[52:58] so he's not he's not really a young
[53:01] convert 30 30 years of Paul's life
[53:04] from the time he was converted is pretty
[53:07] active yeah a lot of experiences good
[53:10] and bad
[53:12] and and so now we know he's writing to
[53:16] the to the Galatians
[53:18] and they're kind of in the same
[53:20] situation that we
[53:22] see in Acts 15.
[53:25] where the church at Antioch
[53:28] which is not an infant Church
[53:31] it's a church that that was begun when
[53:36] when Paul
[53:37] was in his ministry under the law
[53:40] and he was persecuting the church and
[53:43] and going house to house and
[53:47] and Scattered the church abroad and they
[53:50] went everywhere
[53:52] preaching the word
[53:54] now that was the first missionaries amen
[53:57] was the church
[53:59] not the apostles
[54:01] they stayed they stayed in Jerusalem
[54:04] it said the church was scattered abroad
[54:07] and went everywhere preaching the word
[54:08] and the apostles
[54:10] stayed in Jerusalem
[54:13] so if he writes another book of Acts you
[54:16] all got some missionary work to do
[54:19] and uh missionary work in the beginning
[54:22] wasn't overseas missionary work was
[54:26] local but we've made it kind of an
[54:28] overseas thing and then we've made
[54:30] anybody that steps on an airplane or a
[54:34] boat or something and goes overseas
[54:35] they're on missionary work or a
[54:38] missionary and that's that's not always
[54:41] true
[54:42] [Music]
[54:44] but um so he's he's 30 years and and so
[54:49] this church like I said like Antioch
[54:51] they was they were an established church
[54:55] they were established when the church
[54:57] was scattered abroad there were some
[54:59] that went up to Antioch
[55:01] and the way the churches started was
[55:04] that people
[55:05] were testifying
[55:08] of what had happened into their lives
[55:10] hey man and when they did
[55:13] uh they didn't have Bibles and tracks
[55:16] they only could talk about the gospel
[55:19] that had been preached to them and the
[55:21] experience that they had had
[55:24] and and when those that believe their
[55:28] testimony
[55:29] uh and repented and were baptized they
[55:32] were filled with the Holy Spirit
[55:35] and the Holy Spirit was the center of
[55:37] their Gathering it wasn't a building and
[55:41] and it wasn't a Ministry so much but it
[55:44] was it was the resurrected Christ it was
[55:47] the new life that they had in common and
[55:50] now it was it was starting an
[55:53] exploration of this new kingdom this new
[55:56] life that they were in
[55:58] and and so that they were established
[56:01] early on and then after Paul was
[56:04] converted
[56:05] that uh Barnabas went and got Paul and
[56:08] brought him back over to Antioch and
[56:11] they began to establish the church
[56:15] and I think it was maybe a year or two
[56:17] years three years
[56:20] and Paul now has been converted I think
[56:23] maybe 10 to 12 years
[56:26] and and these things are kind of
[56:28] interesting when you're trying to get a
[56:31] picture in your mind of what's taken
[56:33] place how long this has been and
[56:35] sometimes you read one page and go to
[56:37] the next page and there may be years
[56:39] separating it and you're reading it like
[56:41] hours apart you know and and so then the
[56:46] church was was established like this
[56:49] church amen it was it had a Teaching
[56:51] Ministry they had Barnabas he was
[56:54] considered to be a prophet and he was a
[56:57] faithful man he was chosen by the
[57:00] pillars in Jerusalem to go up and and to
[57:03] establish that church they had
[57:05] confidence in his ministry and in his
[57:07] character and amen and then uh when he
[57:11] when he got to the church and began
[57:14] preaching and looking at the things that
[57:17] was circled about him he he thought
[57:19] about Paul and I think he was related to
[57:21] Paul distantly and so then he went and
[57:25] he he recruited Paul and and come back
[57:28] and you know uh God had called Paul on
[57:33] the road to Damascus right amen and he
[57:37] had commissioned him and told him that
[57:39] he was going to suffer a lot of things
[57:41] for him
[57:42] [Music]
[57:43] you know he wasn't talking about
[57:45] cruises and airplanes and five-star
[57:48] hotels and you know like some of the
[57:52] missionaries today you know really rough
[57:56] it you know but
[57:58] um
[57:59] so it was about 10 12 years now he'd
[58:04] been pastoring this church along with
[58:06] Barnabas probably about a year year and
[58:09] a half two years
[58:11] and now God is going to send him out
[58:13] he's he called him but now it's been 10
[58:17] years or so and now he's sending him
[58:20] Hallelujah
[58:22] you know it wasn't just an overnight
[58:24] thing no sir
[58:27] sometimes sometimes you know we we feel
[58:30] a calling and and we're out the next day
[58:33] and
[58:34] but you know things with God
[58:37] takes time because he's not a creature
[58:40] at times so he ain't worried about time
[58:44] you and I are the ones that's worried
[58:45] about timing
[58:47] that's why every Church AIDS they were
[58:49] looking for the Rapture in their age
[58:51] we're looking we're looking to step
[58:54] across we're looking at the news we're
[58:56] looking at the atmosphere we're looking
[58:58] at prophecy we're looking at we're
[59:00] looking at everything and it and it's
[59:02] just so intimate it just it just seems
[59:05] like we're standing on the on the cliff
[59:08] on the precipice and we're just about to
[59:10] step off into this dimension of I'll Fly
[59:13] Away and we're looking at everything
[59:16] we're looking at the ministry we're
[59:19] looking how the preaching is is pulling
[59:21] and focusing within the rims of the
[59:23] Bride we're looking out at the United
[59:26] States we see this this religious thirst
[59:29] for God you know I was looking at Asbury
[59:33] and I thought you know there's one thing
[59:36] about this people are coming from all
[59:38] over the states I think from overseas
[59:41] and they're standing in line for a mile
[59:43] to uh a long distance just to get in
[59:47] into this college into this atmosphere
[59:50] where the holy spirit is just falling
[59:53] and and they're just worshiping and
[59:55] praising and they're just they're
[59:57] hungering and thirsting for the reality
[1:00:01] of a living God
[1:00:03] man there's no word
[1:00:06] they're not preaching repentance but
[1:00:09] it's a it's an atmosphere or a spirit of
[1:00:12] worship amen you know when the two
[1:00:15] churches came together in the Book of
[1:00:16] Genesis
[1:00:18] when when Adam and and when Cain or Abel
[1:00:22] and Cain or Abel and Cain when they came
[1:00:25] together at the first church meeting it
[1:00:27] was about worship they came to worship
[1:00:30] God they came to present their offerings
[1:00:33] they they came to worship and one was
[1:00:35] accepted and one wasn't
[1:00:37] but it shows us that there's a genuine
[1:00:41] thirst in this country amen amen I was
[1:00:44] reading about a young girl on it was on
[1:00:47] the news and she was a
[1:00:49] valedictorian and she gave a a speech
[1:00:53] there where she was the valedictorians
[1:00:56] always give a speech when they graduate
[1:00:58] and she started talking about Jesus
[1:01:01] Christ you know that forbidden word that
[1:01:04] forbidden name now if somebody got up
[1:01:07] there and cursed and used his name in
[1:01:09] vain you know they they wouldn't blip it
[1:01:11] out they wouldn't do anything they'd
[1:01:12] just go right on but now to give glory
[1:01:15] to that name or to speak Redemptive
[1:01:19] properties in that name or religiously
[1:01:21] to refer to that name that's that's
[1:01:25] almost against the law it will be before
[1:01:27] long exactly right and and there was
[1:01:31] such a she was talking about if you go
[1:01:33] out
[1:01:34] and no matter whether you're successful
[1:01:37] or unsuccessful
[1:01:39] she said
[1:01:41] it's she said his strength Jesus's
[1:01:45] strength is made perfect through our
[1:01:47] weakness and she was talking about
[1:01:50] Christ and oh it and and they responded
[1:01:55] to such an internet responded it was a a
[1:01:58] positive overwhelming response
[1:02:01] this country
[1:02:03] the book of uh Hosea or Amos it said
[1:02:07] they would go from sea to Sea come on
[1:02:10] and they'd go from North to the east to
[1:02:14] seek a word of the Lord they wouldn't
[1:02:16] find it but it said they would be
[1:02:19] seeking they wouldn't be seeking
[1:02:21] intellectual things they wouldn't be
[1:02:23] seeking colleges they wouldn't be
[1:02:26] seeking scientific understanding but
[1:02:28] they would be seeking a word of God and
[1:02:32] not be able to find it so somebody is
[1:02:36] seeking for a word from God and can't
[1:02:40] find it man it's like when we was here
[1:02:43] the last time
[1:02:44] in his light shall we see light
[1:02:47] David he thirsted for God
[1:02:51] Psalms 42 my soul thirsts for God
[1:02:56] he must have thought about that a second
[1:02:59] because he said for a living God
[1:03:03] it's just interesting the way that
[1:03:06] things are are written into the
[1:03:07] scriptures and it's all with a purpose
[1:03:10] there's no Idle Word in the scriptures
[1:03:14] and David said my soul thirsts for God
[1:03:19] a living God now what's the difference
[1:03:22] between God and a living God well uh a
[1:03:27] God could be a totem pole it could be a
[1:03:29] piece of wood it could be a god up
[1:03:32] somewhere in another dimension up above
[1:03:34] the clouds or somewhere something that
[1:03:36] would maybe be intangible or or
[1:03:39] something that you couldn't really
[1:03:41] commune with but God was so real to
[1:03:45] David
[1:03:46] that a living God speaks of a communion
[1:03:49] it speaks of a relationship it is and
[1:03:53] that's what he wanted with God he said
[1:03:56] oh he said I go to church with the
[1:03:58] Believers I I sing with all the
[1:04:01] Believers we sing the the songs of joy
[1:04:04] and worship and the glory of God and he
[1:04:07] said I come away and there's tears in my
[1:04:09] eyes why am I crying I just came from
[1:04:11] church but there's there's tears in my
[1:04:14] eyes because he was looking for that
[1:04:17] presence of God the reality reality of a
[1:04:21] living God that's David's whole life
[1:04:24] that's why when he was enthroned and he
[1:04:27] was sit upon the throne over the 12
[1:04:29] tribes the first thing he he wanted to
[1:04:33] do he he went up and he and he conquered
[1:04:36] there was a citadel on Mount Zion I
[1:04:39] think it was uh it might have been the
[1:04:41] Philistines or somebody had a had a
[1:04:44] fortress up there and in the days of the
[1:04:46] judges in the days of Saul nobody could
[1:04:49] take that Fortress nobody could break
[1:04:52] those seals
[1:04:56] but David of the line of the tribe of
[1:04:59] Judah
[1:05:00] he went up and he took that Citadel and
[1:05:04] there became the city of David it was to
[1:05:07] there that he brought the ark they found
[1:05:10] a a temporary resting place which was a
[1:05:13] type of the Gentiles
[1:05:16] because in there there was no sacrifices
[1:05:19] and any priest could go into the
[1:05:22] presence of the Ark in the Tabernacle of
[1:05:24] David
[1:05:25] it was a symbol of the of the Gentile
[1:05:29] Church during the church ages amen and
[1:05:32] anybody could go in and they had
[1:05:34] recorders in there because when any
[1:05:37] priest went in the inspiration struck
[1:05:40] him and and David when he when he
[1:05:43] brought that heat he stood in that
[1:05:45] moment he stood he stood as Melchizedek
[1:05:49] there it is he was never a priest but he
[1:05:52] stood in the position of a priest
[1:05:55] because when he brought the ark he
[1:05:57] thought Lord I want you in the middle of
[1:06:01] the people I want you to be the center
[1:06:03] of the people so David's love for God
[1:06:06] brought God into the presence he wanted
[1:06:09] him to be the king he wanted him to be
[1:06:12] the one that was worshiped it was God
[1:06:14] that David wanted to unveil down in that
[1:06:17] Valley that day the God that he knew
[1:06:20] that Israel didn't know they stood there
[1:06:23] they knew about him but they didn't know
[1:06:26] him and there stood a giant down there
[1:06:29] challenging them
[1:06:30] man and David said all that all of
[1:06:33] Israel and all the nations would know
[1:06:36] that there is a living God in the midst
[1:06:38] of Israel he came down to unveil God he
[1:06:42] didn't come down to be a champion he
[1:06:45] came down to unveil God to the people
[1:06:48] but when the people got back when the
[1:06:51] church got back they said oh Saul has
[1:06:54] slayed a thousand and David ten thousand
[1:06:57] they only found another champion
[1:06:59] I think sometimes
[1:07:02] in this message people have only found
[1:07:04] another hero another champion
[1:07:07] another great uh patriarch a great man
[1:07:12] but he come to unveil God to the people
[1:07:15] he come to unveil Christ to the people
[1:07:20] and I think that's what we we miss it
[1:07:23] sometimes
[1:07:26] brother good preaching
[1:07:29] so I thought anniversary okay
[1:07:33] so anniversary sometimes we
[1:07:35] we pull out the photo albums
[1:07:38] and then we go back
[1:07:40] come on this is a picture of the day we
[1:07:42] got married here
[1:07:44] so then you know how photo albums family
[1:07:47] photo albums sometimes you go oh
[1:07:52] after book five you start getting a
[1:07:54] little bit weary you know and and the
[1:07:56] host is going oh here's another one
[1:07:58] right here and you're going another one
[1:08:01] really you know
[1:08:03] and and so then brother Wade was giving
[1:08:07] us a little uh photo album view of what
[1:08:09] it was when we used to come here
[1:08:12] together and before all the remodeling
[1:08:14] and things
[1:08:15] and and so then there was kind of two
[1:08:19] lives
[1:08:20] of the assembly here the building sort
[1:08:22] of to speak you know there was the the
[1:08:25] old church and and listen it got pretty
[1:08:29] cold out here in the in the winter time
[1:08:31] I guess some of y'all know that it was a
[1:08:33] long trip up those steps
[1:08:36] I mean the wind was blowing and just the
[1:08:39] whole goodness and you'd get in here and
[1:08:41] of course the heaters would be fired up
[1:08:42] and and from the ceiling down to about
[1:08:45] the waist it was hotter than a
[1:08:47] firecracker but the floor up it was
[1:08:49] colder than Iceberg you could look down
[1:08:52] there and see if anything was down there
[1:08:54] you know and then there was the Outhouse
[1:08:57] right
[1:08:59] uh all those modern conveniences of the
[1:09:02] day you know
[1:09:04] but we didn't care
[1:09:07] we come to worship we come to hear the
[1:09:10] word of God you know these things are
[1:09:14] nice they're comfortable you know it'd
[1:09:16] be hard to sit outside now and all the
[1:09:19] humidity and just so these things are
[1:09:22] nice but they're not the most important
[1:09:24] thing no sir there it is so Paul said
[1:09:27] the life that I now live so then there
[1:09:31] was a life that he lived previously
[1:09:34] and and then when he uh I I started
[1:09:38] looking at some of his his testimonies
[1:09:40] and the first time we find in the book
[1:09:43] of Acts I think it's chapter nine
[1:09:45] that that he rehearses the events as
[1:09:48] they happen it's more a chronological as
[1:09:52] I guess he's telling Luke you know and
[1:09:55] he's reminiscing and Lucas writing these
[1:09:57] things down and so Luke writes that in
[1:10:00] in the ninth chapter
[1:10:02] and then I think it's the 26th chapter
[1:10:05] it's a it's a testimony to Agrippa and
[1:10:09] he he goes into a little bit different
[1:10:12] uh same events but it's just a little
[1:10:15] bit different and he's doing it he's
[1:10:18] he's saying I thought this was a paradox
[1:10:21] amen he said I stand Here In Chains
[1:10:25] for the hope of Israel yeah think about
[1:10:27] that
[1:10:28] you know the bride one day
[1:10:30] will stand in Chains yeah for the hope
[1:10:34] of the church amen
[1:10:36] come on
[1:10:37] because the whole
[1:10:39] is is to look for a Revival of
[1:10:41] restoration
[1:10:43] that's that's what's sweeping this
[1:10:45] country there's a hunger and there's a
[1:10:47] thirst and I got to thinking you know
[1:10:49] you know the the bride she has a
[1:10:52] Ministry
[1:10:54] and the foolish virgin will have a
[1:10:56] Ministry in that tribulation period
[1:11:00] it looks like to me that the foolish
[1:11:03] virgin is receiving a call there it is
[1:11:06] brother
[1:11:07] she's hungering and thirsting for the
[1:11:09] oil we know that was way back in brother
[1:11:12] branham's day but listen they've got to
[1:11:15] come to a position because they that are
[1:11:17] righteous will remain righteous amen
[1:11:19] they've got they're not it's not some
[1:11:22] kind of great Revival they're going to
[1:11:24] have during the tribulation period it's
[1:11:27] something that's carried across in the
[1:11:29] ark of their hearts we're carried up
[1:11:32] they're carried in but there will be a
[1:11:34] Ministry because she be slain for the
[1:11:36] word of God for faith
[1:11:39] so look how close that we are look at
[1:11:42] the messages we find that people are
[1:11:45] speaking more than ever about about the
[1:11:48] third poll about speaking the word and
[1:11:50] and I personally believe it's going to
[1:11:52] be just like when was here the last time
[1:11:55] I was talking to you about Hope becoming
[1:11:58] faith and how that that Sarah down there
[1:12:03] in chapter 18 of Genesis that how that
[1:12:06] she was when I read over in in the 11th
[1:12:10] chapter of Hebrews in the in the 11th
[1:12:13] verse it says and Sarah also by faith
[1:12:18] receives strength dunamis
[1:12:21] that she might conceive seed but you
[1:12:24] know in in Genesis 18 that was the son
[1:12:28] of man revealing himself to the church
[1:12:31] Abraham had already recognized him
[1:12:34] but Sarah hadn't recognized him and she
[1:12:38] laughed when she when he said you're
[1:12:40] going to have a child so that wasn't
[1:12:42] Revel that wasn't Hebrews 11 11 yet
[1:12:45] because she was laughing at him but it
[1:12:48] was it was God revealing himself to her
[1:12:53] you know you've got to meet him yourself
[1:12:56] amen you've got to know the guaranteer
[1:12:59] of the promise it's one thing to know
[1:13:02] the promise but it's another thing to
[1:13:05] know the guaranteer of that promise
[1:13:08] you know when you buy things and you
[1:13:10] find there's a warranty you say well
[1:13:12] what company is backing this up come on
[1:13:14] is it some notable company is it some
[1:13:17] company has been around for a long time
[1:13:18] or is it some company I've never heard
[1:13:21] of and are they even proven do they even
[1:13:24] back up their guarantee and then some
[1:13:27] guarantees you know you buy this watch
[1:13:29] for twenty dollars they made it for
[1:13:31] about two bucks and it's got a lifetime
[1:13:34] warranty and you're always sending it
[1:13:37] back in of course when you send it in it
[1:13:39] cost you 15 or 20 dollars to get your
[1:13:41] free one back and they've already made
[1:13:44] their money to give you about 10 or 15
[1:13:46] of them so that warranty really ain't
[1:13:49] much good amen so then God is a
[1:13:53] guaranteer of his promises by two
[1:13:57] immutable things by his word and by
[1:13:59] himself he's sworn to us that he would
[1:14:03] come back and receive us unto himself
[1:14:07] and now that hope is becoming Faith but
[1:14:11] then we find that her body was changed
[1:14:14] she recognized God in human flesh and
[1:14:18] she recognized that she had met that God
[1:14:21] in that guaranteer and now she could say
[1:14:24] like Abraham according to Hebrews 11 11
[1:14:27] she said he is able to fulfill that
[1:14:31] promise because she had met him it's one
[1:14:34] thing to read the book it's another
[1:14:36] thing to meet the author in your life
[1:14:39] and Paul was pointing back to a life he
[1:14:42] had previously lived
[1:14:44] in Galatians 1 he says you know what I
[1:14:48] was I persecuted the church and and all
[1:14:51] but now
[1:14:53] now he he had given his life to serve
[1:14:56] God
[1:14:57] something had changed in his life
[1:15:00] something back there there was an event
[1:15:03] somewhere
[1:15:04] listen it wasn't when he met him on the
[1:15:07] road to Damascus that wasn't the change
[1:15:09] that was an event amen that was an
[1:15:12] attraction amen that was the meeting of
[1:15:15] the guaranteer but he hadn't taken up
[1:15:18] residence yet
[1:15:20] but all when he went back into that City
[1:15:23] and then the agabus came and spoke to
[1:15:26] him and laid hands on him and scales
[1:15:28] fell from his eyes and he was filled
[1:15:31] with the Holy Ghost that was a change
[1:15:38] I remember back
[1:15:41] when we first were converted
[1:15:44] every one of us
[1:15:47] if if we if we're truly born again
[1:15:52] every one of us ought to be able to say
[1:15:55] the life that I used to live there it is
[1:15:59] the life that I now live amen
[1:16:03] you know did we join a church or we
[1:16:06] joined a group of people
[1:16:08] or is it was it something
[1:16:11] with you as an individual
[1:16:15] uh did something really happen to you
[1:16:18] has it been tested there it is brother
[1:16:21] time-tested Memorial
[1:16:24] God didn't want memorials up here on the
[1:16:26] billboard
[1:16:27] he didn't want monuments down here in
[1:16:30] the graveyard
[1:16:31] he didn't want statues in the middle of
[1:16:34] the city
[1:16:35] he wanted living memorials
[1:16:39] time tested there it is
[1:16:44] we was in our living room or in the
[1:16:47] kitchen and we're sitting at a dining
[1:16:48] room table and there was an event that
[1:16:51] taken place in my wife and my life
[1:16:54] and from that time
[1:17:00] you know I can't remember going
[1:17:01] repenting and asking Jesus to be my
[1:17:04] savior but there was a there was an
[1:17:06] event
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:09] there was a lot of crime
[1:17:12] amen and didn't know why I was crying
[1:17:16] drove to work that day I was working a
[1:17:19] swing shift it was three o'clock
[1:17:22] why am I crying it's not in crime
[1:17:25] about a month after I was saved
[1:17:29] had a man come up to me a Baptist man
[1:17:32] he said Mike he said I want you to come
[1:17:34] over here I want to talk to you I said
[1:17:35] okay
[1:17:37] he said
[1:17:38] you know
[1:17:40] in this
[1:17:42] in this one month that you've been saved
[1:17:44] here on this plant
[1:17:46] he said you've had more of an impact on
[1:17:49] this plant than I have
[1:17:51] in the three or four years I've been
[1:17:53] working here a Baptist think about that
[1:17:56] but you know he never asked me what
[1:17:59] happened no
[1:18:00] no
[1:18:01] and I never knew that there was a change
[1:18:04] right right because I was going to
[1:18:07] church me and my wife we lived for
[1:18:09] Wednesday we lived for Sunday that was
[1:18:11] bad it was on we had our other routines
[1:18:13] but this was our whole life
[1:18:15] it was something something brand new
[1:18:17] right
[1:18:18] and and
[1:18:20] I was reading the messages and listening
[1:18:23] to tapes I'm a reader and I just all my
[1:18:26] time just reading and then one day you
[1:18:29] know somebody asked me a question and I
[1:18:32] went to answer it and I realized I knew
[1:18:35] a lot about the message but I hadn't
[1:18:37] been reading my Bible
[1:18:38] come on now you know we we got this is
[1:18:42] the absolute you better believe it right
[1:18:43] the seal book is not the absolute this
[1:18:46] is the absolute the church age book is
[1:18:49] not the absolute this is the absolute
[1:18:52] this is the book that's going to judge
[1:18:54] this generation
[1:18:58] God sent a prophet he didn't send the
[1:19:01] message for salvation
[1:19:04] we've had salvation since the day of
[1:19:07] Pentecost
[1:19:09] we've had salvation since the day that
[1:19:11] Christ was crucified and was rose again
[1:19:14] and the gospel began to be preached in
[1:19:17] Jerusalem and throughout the world but
[1:19:20] what this message did was to separate
[1:19:22] yeah it was a calling out it didn't come
[1:19:26] to make a separation a denomination it
[1:19:29] came to call the people
[1:19:32] to reach down to Open the Eyes of the
[1:19:36] heart David said sin thy light thy light
[1:19:40] don't send a light send thy light and
[1:19:44] thy truth that it might lead me to thy
[1:19:48] Tabernacles amen you know they're
[1:19:51] wanting to find him
[1:19:54] job wanted to find him amen he said if I
[1:19:57] knew where his throne was if I knew
[1:19:59] where his seat was I'd go there and I
[1:20:01] knock I got questions I'd like to talk
[1:20:03] to him about
[1:20:05] you know God had revealed to job
[1:20:08] it revealed to him
[1:20:10] that there was a forgiveness of sin
[1:20:12] through the shedding of blood amen Amen
[1:20:15] brother Brown said he was a prophet and
[1:20:17] he looked up into the stars and the Holy
[1:20:20] Spirit revealed to job through those
[1:20:22] constellations
[1:20:24] that there was the forgiveness of sin
[1:20:27] through the shedding of blood think
[1:20:29] about that and it said that job offered
[1:20:32] up a sacrifice for his children in case
[1:20:37] they had had committed a secret sin
[1:20:41] so the sacrifice that he was offering
[1:20:43] was for sin amen so he knew that there
[1:20:47] was an atonement that's why God could
[1:20:49] look down and say he's perfect he's
[1:20:51] upright in his generation it didn't mean
[1:20:54] that he was of a good behavior it didn't
[1:20:56] mean that he was of a correct character
[1:20:58] it didn't mean that his neighbors loved
[1:21:00] him and he was the most perfect man it
[1:21:03] meant that God was looking at him
[1:21:04] through the Revelation that he had
[1:21:07] revealed to him
[1:21:09] and you know that shedding of that blood
[1:21:11] didn't do one thing for him it didn't do
[1:21:14] one thing for his children it was the
[1:21:17] expression of the Revelation that he had
[1:21:20] and it was The Obedience of faith that
[1:21:24] caused the sacrifice he was forgiven by
[1:21:28] faith he was justified through faith not
[1:21:31] sacrifice
[1:21:32] but there was a question
[1:21:36] and what happens after I die
[1:21:38] my sins are forgiven I stand in the
[1:21:41] presence of God Justified righteous
[1:21:44] but but what happens when I die oh
[1:21:47] I just wished I knew where he was I want
[1:21:49] to ask him this question here there must
[1:21:51] be something that follows this I see the
[1:21:54] tree falls I I see it die I see it come
[1:21:57] back up but what about a man when he
[1:22:00] dies he said oh I I just want to see him
[1:22:03] I I want to Open the Eyes of My Heart
[1:22:06] Lord I want to see your dwelling place I
[1:22:09] want to find you I want to talk to you
[1:22:11] and God granted him that he wasn't
[1:22:14] exactly like he thought he said gird up
[1:22:16] your loins I'm fixing to talk to you and
[1:22:19] I'm going to talk to you like a man you
[1:22:21] know and he said where were you you know
[1:22:23] he you know oh now you know something I
[1:22:25] got they're going to open up a seal for
[1:22:27] you and no he was in the middle of an
[1:22:30] eye sheep he was looking death right at
[1:22:32] the gates door
[1:22:34] and he thought he was dying and he was
[1:22:36] wondering what happens after death and
[1:22:39] about that time the London the Thunder
[1:22:41] flashed and the lightning and he said
[1:22:44] all that I my words were written and
[1:22:47] stone that I had Flint to write it in
[1:22:49] that man could read it and I'm reading
[1:22:51] it
[1:22:53] come on now
[1:22:56] and I'm reading that his wish came true
[1:22:59] the Whirlwind came and spoke to him
[1:23:02] and it was revealed to him
[1:23:06] of the Resurrection that though that I
[1:23:08] die and the skin worms eat my flesh I'll
[1:23:12] Stand in this flesh and I'll see my
[1:23:15] redeemer and not as a stranger not
[1:23:18] another but I'll see him in this flesh
[1:23:23] wouldn't he do the same for you
[1:23:27] God is not respecter as a person
[1:23:32] David
[1:23:33] he hungered and thirsted for God
[1:23:36] and I thought you know
[1:23:38] I was looking at my life one time and I
[1:23:40] said
[1:23:42] seems like there's kind of three phases
[1:23:46] three steps
[1:23:48] come on and I said
[1:23:50] the first step
[1:23:52] is kind of like Moses
[1:23:54] in a search for God there it is now
[1:23:57] maybe just listening to the message or
[1:24:00] reading the Bible
[1:24:01] you don't really see Moses so much
[1:24:04] searching for God you just see a a man
[1:24:06] running to the backside of the desert
[1:24:08] that's right but there was a there was a
[1:24:11] sequel written by Ingram
[1:24:12] and and one of them was the prince of
[1:24:15] the House of David and God and brother
[1:24:17] Branham refers to that
[1:24:19] and and that was from John the Baptist
[1:24:22] until the resurrection of Christ it it
[1:24:24] was told in a little story form but it
[1:24:27] was bringing all the scriptures together
[1:24:29] it's a nice book to read if you ever
[1:24:31] want to read it it's it reads like a
[1:24:34] novel but yet we find it Ingram he
[1:24:36] understood the customs and he and he
[1:24:39] really had a way of finding all the
[1:24:41] family relationships and bringing that
[1:24:43] picture together and it just helps you
[1:24:45] when you go back and read the Bible it
[1:24:47] just seems like it it's more alive
[1:24:49] because you're understanding the
[1:24:51] settings a little bit well he wrote
[1:24:53] another book and he called it the pillar
[1:24:55] of Fire
[1:24:56] and in that book it was Moses and in
[1:25:00] there that Moses was seeking for God he
[1:25:03] knew there was a God but like David he
[1:25:06] he wanted he wanted to meet this God
[1:25:08] this living God and all of his life
[1:25:11] sitting in Pharaoh's policy was he was
[1:25:13] looking for that God and when he ran to
[1:25:16] the back side of the desert there was
[1:25:18] still he was one to community he knew
[1:25:21] that there was a God and there was
[1:25:23] something there was a seed down inside
[1:25:25] of him that was reaching out for
[1:25:28] sunlight it was reaching out for water
[1:25:30] it was reaching out to God it was
[1:25:33] thirsting for life and he met him at
[1:25:36] that bush right listen when he went back
[1:25:39] down to Egypt it wasn't just go down
[1:25:42] there like a champion and deliver a
[1:25:44] people with a stick
[1:25:46] no sir no sir all his life he had sought
[1:25:49] for God and he had met him in that bush
[1:25:51] and now he knew God was a reality he
[1:25:54] spoke to him he spoke back he went down
[1:25:57] there to unveil God to the people listen
[1:26:00] anybody that ever meets God truly meets
[1:26:03] God what you want to do is unveil that
[1:26:06] God to people
[1:26:10] does not becoming champions
[1:26:13] is not becoming an associate with an
[1:26:15] important person
[1:26:19] but it's the no without him
[1:26:22] and nothing then without him you're
[1:26:25] nothing
[1:26:27] and anything that I can do without him
[1:26:30] is nothing anything that you can do
[1:26:33] without him is nothing it might be
[1:26:37] important to the family it might be
[1:26:39] important to you temporarily but as far
[1:26:41] as the kingdom of God it's nothing
[1:26:45] amen amen
[1:26:49] and it wasn't it wasn't
[1:26:52] I was trying to think of I was reminded
[1:26:54] of this
[1:26:55] a young man was preaching at our church
[1:26:58] and I'd testified to this
[1:27:01] this experience that I'd went through
[1:27:04] but I don't think I'd been saved very
[1:27:06] long
[1:27:07] and somewhere between a week
[1:27:09] and maybe a month
[1:27:12] and we those were the Happy Days we was
[1:27:16] going to church reading the word
[1:27:19] Whole New World
[1:27:21] it's like walking up to the edge of
[1:27:24] of the Grand Canyon amen
[1:27:29] I walked up and I said
[1:27:32] wow
[1:27:34] Janet crawled up to the rail and said
[1:27:41] but it was wow both ways but it was
[1:27:44] terrifying one way and magnificent
[1:27:46] another way and God's terribly
[1:27:48] magnificent
[1:27:51] and
[1:27:53] but I was somebody was preaching all
[1:27:56] right I was reading
[1:27:58] and over in Matthew
[1:28:00] uh the 12th 13th chapter 12-13
[1:28:05] and and Jesus says
[1:28:08] to blaspheme the Holy Spirit
[1:28:11] there's no forgiveness in this life
[1:28:15] are in the Life to Come
[1:28:17] and I read that
[1:28:19] and I was
[1:28:21] I was a an atheist
[1:28:23] when me and my wife were saved
[1:28:26] and an atheist is a is an intellect
[1:28:30] and nobody's born an atheist no
[1:28:33] no and nobody's born a Christian no sir
[1:28:36] we're born pagans but there's a soul in
[1:28:40] us and we know that there is a God
[1:28:42] somewhere
[1:28:47] and so
[1:28:49] I I heard that or I read it and I said
[1:28:53] whoa
[1:28:58] man you talk about empty I thought about
[1:29:00] the jokes that I told
[1:29:03] times I'd use the name of the Lord in
[1:29:05] vain
[1:29:06] me and my daddy mocked Oral Roberts and
[1:29:09] made fun of him watching him on TV and
[1:29:11] just man I thought about those things
[1:29:13] and I said
[1:29:14] whoa
[1:29:16] the blaspheme the Holy Spirit there's no
[1:29:20] forgiveness
[1:29:21] I said
[1:29:23] I said I can't there's no way I can get
[1:29:26] saved
[1:29:28] I was kind of like the Antioch Church
[1:29:30] come on there they was filled with the
[1:29:34] Holy Spirit born again
[1:29:36] and somebody comes along and said oh you
[1:29:38] can't get born again you can't get saved
[1:29:40] till you get circumcised yeah come on
[1:29:42] now you got to speak in tongues you got
[1:29:43] to shake the preacher's hand you got to
[1:29:45] believe brother Brown's a Prophet come
[1:29:47] on
[1:29:51] and I said
[1:29:53] oh you talk and that was an anointed
[1:29:57] message from God Amen the devil didn't
[1:30:00] give me that message
[1:30:03] and I thought
[1:30:06] I said well I can't tell Janet
[1:30:09] I sure ain't gonna tell nobody at the
[1:30:11] church
[1:30:12] but I'm just as lost
[1:30:15] as loss can be
[1:30:17] I can go to church all my life I can do
[1:30:20] whatever I want to do
[1:30:22] and there's no way for me to go to
[1:30:24] heaven no way to get saved
[1:30:27] oh I felt so
[1:30:29] yeah and lost I felt like that young man
[1:30:33] brother Brown talks about without social
[1:30:35] disease and was on that boat and he said
[1:30:37] oh it's getting dark right
[1:30:41] you talk about getting dark
[1:30:45] and I thought well
[1:30:48] I sure like reading this Bible
[1:30:52] amen and I sure like listening to these
[1:30:54] tapes and reading this message I sure
[1:30:56] like that
[1:30:58] and I sure like going to church
[1:31:02] and I look back
[1:31:04] and I didn't see anything I wanted to go
[1:31:06] back to no sir and I thought well yeah
[1:31:11] I can't never get saved
[1:31:13] but I'm going to keep on going to church
[1:31:20] and I want to tell you God anointed that
[1:31:22] because it was real to me man amen I'm
[1:31:26] talking about real
[1:31:29] and it it went about I don't know how
[1:31:32] long it went a week two or three days
[1:31:35] but he left me like that whoa and I'm in
[1:31:38] here it was inspired sure
[1:31:43] I started going to church and then one
[1:31:47] day I was reading in my Bible and
[1:31:50] and I was reading and Paul said
[1:31:52] I was a blasphemer of blasphemy I said
[1:31:57] wait a minute
[1:31:59] and I got to thinking about what Paul
[1:32:01] had done he had killed some of those
[1:32:02] people and caused him and put in jail
[1:32:04] and all that he did and these and Jesus
[1:32:08] said thou persecuted me
[1:32:11] you blasphemed me it was me that you
[1:32:15] killed
[1:32:16] I said
[1:32:18] I started seeing a little bit of light
[1:32:21] at the end of the time
[1:32:23] and I see people leaving the word of God
[1:32:26] leaving the message leaving and going
[1:32:29] back into the world
[1:32:33] no I I can't I can't see that no sir
[1:32:39] you know we we have to have
[1:32:43] those experiences to be time-tested
[1:32:47] memorials
[1:32:48] we have to come to disappointments we
[1:32:52] have to come to discouragement
[1:32:54] and and God he's gonna he's Gonna Leave
[1:32:57] You he's Gonna Leave You without any
[1:32:59] emotion
[1:33:01] without any reasoning
[1:33:06] to give you a little word to stand on
[1:33:09] you you won't even be able to say Amen
[1:33:12] to it you won't even be able to raise
[1:33:14] your hand all you can do is stand on
[1:33:18] that Solid Rock
[1:33:21] because there's an affinity there's an
[1:33:24] attachment to that rock and you believe
[1:33:27] that in that rock there's Security in
[1:33:29] that rock there's peace in that rock is
[1:33:32] life
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:35] that life
[1:33:38] that I now live
[1:33:41] in contrast
[1:33:44] pick up the old photo albums right we do
[1:33:46] that yeah
[1:33:48] see you standing there with a beer in
[1:33:50] your hand and cigarette
[1:33:53] you know out there hunting Easter eggs
[1:33:55] and all that
[1:33:57] you know
[1:33:59] nobody had to tell me to quit doing that
[1:34:01] no no sir
[1:34:03] you know I had somebody tell my
[1:34:05] testimony for me one time and when I got
[1:34:07] saved I love riding dirt bikes
[1:34:10] oh I love that bike it was just like a
[1:34:13] horse to me you know there was a bond we
[1:34:15] can go up we'd go through the mud we'd
[1:34:17] go through the sand all go out in the
[1:34:19] woods and ride it I don't I didn't much
[1:34:21] care for riding down the highways
[1:34:25] but now when I met him
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:29] and I and I started reading his letters
[1:34:32] oh my
[1:34:33] God when I when I met him and started at
[1:34:36] least listening to his servants that
[1:34:39] that motorcycle started getting cobwebs
[1:34:45] Paulson in Philippians 3.
[1:34:49] he said I suffered the loss of all
[1:34:51] things that didn't mean that he said oh
[1:34:54] quit riding bikes I won't do that
[1:34:58] anymore because I'm gonna live for
[1:35:00] Christ I'm not going to smoke cigarettes
[1:35:03] anymore I'm oh I I want to really bad
[1:35:06] but I'm gonna I'm gonna be a martyr
[1:35:10] he never gave up nothing
[1:35:13] if you did you never gave it up
[1:35:17] when you don't have to give it up and
[1:35:19] you leave it that's when you gave it up
[1:35:22] you know when a woman when she when she
[1:35:25] quits wearing pants and starts wearing a
[1:35:27] dress
[1:35:28] when she quits cutting her hair to be
[1:35:31] part of the message and part of the
[1:35:32] Believers
[1:35:33] and you never really became part but
[1:35:37] when you read that you were sealed onto
[1:35:40] the day of your Redemption you could cut
[1:35:43] your hair you could smoke cigarettes you
[1:35:45] could drink beer you could wear pants
[1:35:47] you can wear shorts bikinis anything you
[1:35:51] want to and you're going to heaven
[1:35:54] then when you quit
[1:35:57] brother that's when you quit
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:01] listen this ain't this ain't a
[1:36:03] bargaining table
[1:36:06] this ain't a trade-off
[1:36:09] he said the life that I now live
[1:36:12] he said I've been crucified well I
[1:36:15] wanted to speak a little bit on the old
[1:36:17] man and the new man
[1:36:19] you know he talks about the old man the
[1:36:22] new man you know that's your life that
[1:36:25] you're now living the new man and the
[1:36:28] old life that you used to live that's
[1:36:30] the old man the old man is crucified I
[1:36:33] put off the old man with his deeds and
[1:36:37] his conversation see your life has
[1:36:41] changed the control tower has changed
[1:36:43] and then there's the Inner Man and the
[1:36:46] outer man now the outer man's never been
[1:36:49] crucified it was the old man that was
[1:36:52] crucified that was that first husband
[1:36:55] that was that old nature of the world
[1:36:59] that's what you were when that control
[1:37:01] tower when your spirit was in Control
[1:37:05] operating through your five senses and
[1:37:07] your memory and your emotions but
[1:37:10] something happened that man died and you
[1:37:14] got a new man a new birth and then
[1:37:17] there's an outer man he's getting old
[1:37:19] he's through wrecks and heart surgery
[1:37:21] and then there's the Inner Man and he's
[1:37:25] been strengthened by the power of His
[1:37:27] might by the spirit of him that created
[1:37:30] him after the knowledge of him that
[1:37:32] created him we got the outer man we got
[1:37:35] the inner man we got the old man we got
[1:37:38] the new man we got the new creation a
[1:37:41] new creature that's you as a Triune
[1:37:42] being
[1:37:43] yeah man amen amen that's good brother
[1:37:48] use him Lord
[1:37:51] let me let me just
[1:37:53] I just had this kind of
[1:37:55] on my heart with a bunch of other stones
[1:37:58] but
[1:37:59] you'll go to uh Romans 7 for a moment
[1:38:04] Romans chapter 7.
[1:38:09] you know this is where
[1:38:13] most of us
[1:38:14] a lot of times
[1:38:16] we struggle
[1:38:18] right here
[1:38:20] right here
[1:38:23] because we got the Holy Ghost
[1:38:25] we're born again
[1:38:27] new control tower
[1:38:30] and yet all the mistakes we made losing
[1:38:33] our temper
[1:38:34] you know what I mean
[1:38:36] just
[1:38:37] and we struggle I got the Holy Ghost
[1:38:41] I don't I didn't go to Holy Ghost
[1:38:44] it was one of my biggest battles when I
[1:38:46] first come to Christ
[1:38:49] the intellect he'd come in
[1:38:51] do you believe brother Brown was a
[1:38:53] prophet you believe serpent seed you
[1:38:55] have been baptized in water baptism
[1:38:59] you got the Holy Ghost
[1:39:01] I got it
[1:39:03] I got it and then I'll be somebody maybe
[1:39:07] still under the shadows of Pentecost you
[1:39:09] ever spoke in tongues uh no has God ever
[1:39:13] you ever heard the voice of God uh
[1:39:16] oh
[1:39:17] I can't say that I have no
[1:39:20] I ain't got it
[1:39:22] and then I got it
[1:39:24] and then I ain't got it and you had it
[1:39:27] all the time
[1:39:31] you had it all the time
[1:39:33] but not being established there's the
[1:39:36] key not being established in the word to
[1:39:39] tell you what happened to you
[1:39:42] and so then and it doesn't make any
[1:39:45] difference if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:39:47] or not if you've got the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:39:49] taught by truly born again and you don't
[1:39:52] think you have it the enemy's got a
[1:39:54] hedge on you
[1:39:56] because he's going to get you to look
[1:39:58] for something else and anything else is
[1:40:01] not the Holy Ghost
[1:40:03] Jesus Christ has come he's the Messiah
[1:40:06] if you're looking for a messiah any
[1:40:09] other Messiah is not the Messiah
[1:40:12] if you're looking for Malachi 4 to be
[1:40:15] fulfilled and it's already been
[1:40:16] fulfilled than any other fulfillment is
[1:40:19] not Malachi for
[1:40:21] you got the real and then you've got the
[1:40:24] counterfeit one real hundreds and
[1:40:27] thousands of counterfeits
[1:40:32] we don't want a counterfeit
[1:40:34] we want the real yeah
[1:40:37] and then one day as I began to read the
[1:40:40] message
[1:40:41] as I begin to read the Bible but
[1:40:43] especially the message
[1:40:45] it began to unveil
[1:40:47] the Holy Spirit
[1:40:50] to me
[1:40:51] that was in me
[1:40:53] and it'd be a personal revelation that's
[1:40:57] the birth yes right you know you can be
[1:41:00] born again but then to have the reality
[1:41:03] I'm not talking about dogmatism
[1:41:05] I'm talking about experience
[1:41:08] and being established by the revealed
[1:41:11] word of God in your heart amen
[1:41:13] amen there it is
[1:41:17] the truth brother we got things today
[1:41:20] that
[1:41:22] I I don't
[1:41:24] but it's disappointing to me what people
[1:41:26] are preaching it has gotten so far
[1:41:31] from Redemption this is this book yeah
[1:41:33] come on now this is a book of time this
[1:41:36] is not a book of Eternity it starts with
[1:41:39] Genesis
[1:41:41] and it ends with Revelation
[1:41:43] it's a book it's a book of redemption
[1:41:47] but before this book
[1:41:50] I was yeah
[1:41:52] Hallelujah
[1:41:54] after this book
[1:41:56] I am
[1:41:58] amen this this is only time yeah right
[1:42:02] this body is only a Time creature
[1:42:06] but before this body I was
[1:42:10] I shouldn't say I am but because I'm a
[1:42:13] creature of time I'm looking at the past
[1:42:16] but with God there is no past
[1:42:18] there is no future there's only the
[1:42:22] presence
[1:42:23] but my death is in him my life my birth
[1:42:26] was in him my whole life is in him
[1:42:30] all creation is in him because in him
[1:42:34] he's Timeless so all time is in him
[1:42:37] everything is in him
[1:42:42] but we're we're still in we're still in
[1:42:45] time
[1:42:48] look over here and if I can do this just
[1:42:51] real quickly
[1:42:53] all right
[1:42:55] in Romans 7.
[1:42:58] no you're not brethren for I speak to
[1:43:01] them that know the law how that the law
[1:43:04] hath dominion over a man as long as he
[1:43:07] liveth
[1:43:08] he's setting up a principle amen that's
[1:43:11] the truth brother man he's he's speaking
[1:43:15] he's using an allegory
[1:43:18] to express something
[1:43:21] and this is this is where the greatest
[1:43:23] battles in your life
[1:43:25] trying to understand how your flesh and
[1:43:28] how your deity how the two comes
[1:43:30] together I'm talking about whether
[1:43:32] rubber meets the road I'm not talking
[1:43:33] about Doctrine that's been taught
[1:43:37] I'm talking about when you're confronted
[1:43:39] and you're faced with reality it's going
[1:43:43] to take more than Doctrine come on now
[1:43:47] it's going to take Faith
[1:43:52] for the woman which hath and husband
[1:43:54] is bound by the law
[1:43:57] to her husband so long as he liveth
[1:44:02] but if the husband be dead
[1:44:05] she is loose from the law of her husband
[1:44:09] so then if while her husband
[1:44:12] liveth she be married to another she
[1:44:15] shall be called an adulteress
[1:44:18] but if her husband be dead
[1:44:21] she is freed from the law
[1:44:23] so that she so that she is no adulteress
[1:44:28] though she be married to another
[1:44:32] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[1:44:35] dead to the law by the whole by the body
[1:44:39] of Christ amen as the old man that is
[1:44:42] crucified
[1:44:43] now crucifixion
[1:44:45] we're not talking about
[1:44:48] death
[1:44:49] crucifixion we're talking about the
[1:44:52] judgment and then the penalty amen so
[1:44:56] crucifixion and more than just death
[1:44:59] it's talking about the Judgment of sin
[1:45:01] he became sin amen he didn't become
[1:45:05] sinful he became sin when God looked
[1:45:09] down on Christ when he hung there at
[1:45:11] Calvary he looked at sin
[1:45:15] he was looking at you the life I used to
[1:45:18] live
[1:45:20] sin and then he judged that sin
[1:45:25] exactly right that's good brother
[1:45:27] crucifixion is just not death it's the
[1:45:31] Judgment of sin and applying the penalty
[1:45:35] for True Justice
[1:45:38] if there's a judgment of guilt and
[1:45:41] there's no penalty there's no justice
[1:45:45] so God didn't forgive you and just
[1:45:47] justify you at the expense of the law no
[1:45:50] sir God paid that penalty in Christ
[1:45:55] and you were in him it listen wasn't
[1:45:58] just proxy
[1:45:59] it wasn't just representation
[1:46:02] but he been the fullness of the word and
[1:46:06] we being attributes were in him
[1:46:09] and when he was judged you were judged
[1:46:13] and when he died you died so it said we
[1:46:16] were crucified we died to the law
[1:46:18] through the body of Christ
[1:46:25] so your sins were settled almost 2 000
[1:46:28] years ago but we had to accept that that
[1:46:31] it had to come it had to come to flesh
[1:46:34] it had to come to repentance it had to
[1:46:37] come to the Fulfillment of righteousness
[1:46:41] good
[1:46:46] good to the law of the body by the body
[1:46:50] of Christ
[1:46:51] that ye should be married to another
[1:46:54] even to him who is raised from the dead
[1:46:58] Hallelujah
[1:47:00] that we look we should bring forth fruit
[1:47:05] so the idea is just not becoming a widow
[1:47:09] independent free no headship now I can
[1:47:14] do whatever I want to do
[1:47:17] but the freedom
[1:47:19] from the first husband
[1:47:21] is so that
[1:47:24] for this reason
[1:47:25] that I can be married again
[1:47:28] to him that has risen from the dead
[1:47:31] Christ
[1:47:33] that
[1:47:34] I might bring forth fruit
[1:47:39] thank you
[1:47:44] amen you ever thought
[1:47:46] we're talking about one woman
[1:47:50] and two husbands
[1:47:52] think about that
[1:47:54] you ever you ever thought about Abigail
[1:47:58] come on
[1:48:00] there it is look over in first first
[1:48:02] Samuel
[1:48:05] first Samuel 25.
[1:48:09] and I'm not going to read this whole
[1:48:10] thing I just want to go through it for a
[1:48:13] second
[1:48:14] first Samuel I got to find it
[1:48:18] for Samuel
[1:48:21] 25.
[1:48:30] now
[1:48:34] like the symphony right
[1:48:39] verses verses 1 through about 17.
[1:48:43] he's introducing the characters
[1:48:46] and set in the scene oh Jesus here's
[1:48:49] Abigail
[1:48:51] and her husband nabal
[1:48:53] he's the fool amen he's a rough Man
[1:48:57] Charlie
[1:48:59] he cares nothing about anybody but
[1:49:01] himself there it is
[1:49:03] and Buddy he's a and and as you read the
[1:49:06] story you realize that Abigail is
[1:49:09] married to this man now this is the
[1:49:11] first husband right amen that's exactly
[1:49:14] right you study this thing when you go
[1:49:16] home and then you read you read Romans 7
[1:49:19] 1 1-4
[1:49:21] two husbands one wife amen
[1:49:26] man beautiful and this first marriage
[1:49:28] was not really a marriage by choice
[1:49:31] because when you read about Abigail
[1:49:34] she's a spiritual woman
[1:49:36] she's a predestinated seed she would
[1:49:40] have never chose this man
[1:49:42] but you see he was rich he had a lot of
[1:49:45] property
[1:49:47] a lot of a lot of cattle you know sheep
[1:49:50] and everything
[1:49:51] and
[1:49:53] it was an arranged marriage there it is
[1:49:56] Mom and Dad said well this is going to
[1:49:58] be a good Dowry man this guy's got money
[1:50:00] influence we could you know a little bit
[1:50:02] with the business ties and things you
[1:50:05] know and so here she is you know no
[1:50:09] choice of her own
[1:50:11] amen
[1:50:12] you know you didn't have a choice to be
[1:50:14] born a sinner so I can't wait
[1:50:18] subscribe bro she had no choice so it's
[1:50:21] it kind of sets the picture yeah
[1:50:24] Samuel dies
[1:50:26] now David is going to go off down here
[1:50:28] to this wilderness
[1:50:30] and they say this Wilderness is kind of
[1:50:32] like a No Man's Land it kind of borders
[1:50:34] Israel and Palestine and but man has got
[1:50:37] beautiful grazing
[1:50:39] and so people they they want to send
[1:50:41] their sheep out there to graze and to
[1:50:44] really get healthy and ready for the for
[1:50:46] the Harvest Time for the shearing of the
[1:50:48] sheep and the slaughter and and but the
[1:50:50] bad thing about it there's no law that
[1:50:52] rules out there it's a wilderness so
[1:50:55] when they send them out there there's
[1:50:56] Bandits and guys robbing and stealing
[1:50:59] sheep so you're really taking a chance
[1:51:02] but but it's Paradise you know but
[1:51:05] there's a lot of danger out there you
[1:51:08] know
[1:51:09] the greatest the greater the reward
[1:51:11] sometimes the higher the risk
[1:51:13] so David's going to go down there
[1:51:15] because what happens is that sometimes
[1:51:18] people like David he takes his men down
[1:51:20] there and and they do the little uh kind
[1:51:23] of protection thing so they go down
[1:51:26] there and they they make a living by
[1:51:28] protecting these sheep and things and
[1:51:30] and so they go down there and they
[1:51:32] protect them from the robbers and things
[1:51:33] and that's the testimony of the of the
[1:51:36] herders of nabal they said while Wiz out
[1:51:38] there David was a wall
[1:51:40] now all right hey nobody touched us all
[1:51:43] those robbers and bandits roaming around
[1:51:45] but David and his men as long as we had
[1:51:48] communion with him as long as we stayed
[1:51:51] with him
[1:51:51] it wasn't like uh protection downtown
[1:51:54] New York I'm not talking about that
[1:51:57] he was a wall to us
[1:52:00] and we never lost one sheep he never
[1:52:02] come and said you owe me a sheep
[1:52:04] a sheep all that time he protected us
[1:52:07] Fortress and he comes to the neighbors
[1:52:10] sends his men said oh if it's a time of
[1:52:13] harvest it's a time of Plenty you know
[1:52:16] maybe he got something
[1:52:18] an old neighbor he's our first husband
[1:52:20] isn't he better believe it
[1:52:22] and he says who is this guy
[1:52:25] he probably heard about him yeah who is
[1:52:27] this guy I don't know he could be a
[1:52:29] runaway son a runaway slave I don't know
[1:52:31] now I ain't getting my money to him I
[1:52:34] ain't taking fruit out of my servant's
[1:52:35] mouth and give him he ain't getting
[1:52:37] nothing
[1:52:42] oh David a little self-righteousness got
[1:52:45] in there
[1:52:47] and you know God's keeping his eye out
[1:52:50] better believe he does and uh David says
[1:52:55] I believe this guy treated me like this
[1:52:57] after all I did
[1:53:00] and this is the thanks I get yeah
[1:53:03] all these years I preached and look at
[1:53:05] how the church treats me yeah come on
[1:53:08] look at that preacher all that I've done
[1:53:10] for him and what I've done for the
[1:53:12] church look how they treat me
[1:53:14] you know he says well we're going to see
[1:53:17] something
[1:53:18] you guys
[1:53:20] go put on your swords
[1:53:22] believe it if if there's a male child
[1:53:25] left if there's anybody left of that
[1:53:26] family when I get through
[1:53:28] I'm going to kill them all
[1:53:31] God was concerned about that you better
[1:53:34] believe it David had killed a lot of
[1:53:36] people but it was in for the kingdom
[1:53:39] it was for Israel it was it was for the
[1:53:41] it was the enemies of God but this was
[1:53:43] for his own self-righteousness amen that
[1:53:46] would have been innocent blood on his
[1:53:48] hands exactly right it had come to this
[1:53:50] room yeah now I want you to watch this
[1:53:54] so now Abigail
[1:53:56] some of the some of the Shepherds they
[1:54:00] come to her and they tell her what's
[1:54:02] happened
[1:54:03] and we're just setting a scene right
[1:54:05] this is what step one maybe step two I
[1:54:08] don't know
[1:54:09] I meant to write those things down
[1:54:13] so now
[1:54:15] beautiful now this is you Abigail is you
[1:54:18] man
[1:54:19] that's your soul right
[1:54:23] first husband
[1:54:25] so now
[1:54:27] she learns about David she learns about
[1:54:30] what's happened
[1:54:33] so now
[1:54:35] she comes under the inspiration
[1:54:38] of almighty God now you don't see it
[1:54:41] here but it's there because David tells
[1:54:44] us it's there he sure does
[1:54:47] so then we find from
[1:54:50] from down verse 26 she's inspired she
[1:54:54] she starts getting all the food together
[1:54:57] she takes and she sends her servants out
[1:55:00] in front of her and then you have to
[1:55:01] read about the customs of the time
[1:55:04] and and she sends she sends the food out
[1:55:06] and then she comes
[1:55:09] and then she approaches David
[1:55:12] and oh David he's hot well you better
[1:55:14] believe it he's ready to shed a little
[1:55:16] blood
[1:55:17] and she gets off and she says I want to
[1:55:20] tell you something no
[1:55:22] that's just you this is when you first
[1:55:25] hear the gospel see now you're you're
[1:55:28] you're responding something down in here
[1:55:31] is responding now the old man don't like
[1:55:34] it no sir the husband he never knew
[1:55:37] about it and if she'd have told him and
[1:55:39] he said you can't go she couldn't go but
[1:55:42] there must have been certain loopholes
[1:55:44] within the law of headship
[1:55:47] so then she was able to take this and
[1:55:50] she was able to go and not break the law
[1:55:52] she didn't break the law she wasn't an
[1:55:55] immoral woman
[1:55:56] she she respected headship and she never
[1:56:00] broke the law of headship
[1:56:02] so then she was able to take this
[1:56:04] sacrifice
[1:56:06] and she comes to David
[1:56:09] so then we find that and in verse 27
[1:56:14] she brings forth a fruit for repentance
[1:56:17] now watching this let's go down to verse
[1:56:20] 27 I just want to read something here
[1:56:22] hey man man beautiful
[1:56:27] come on
[1:56:28] um
[1:56:32] I want to go down to verse
[1:56:35] 27.
[1:56:37] 28.
[1:56:42] I pray thee
[1:56:44] forgive the trespass of thy handmaiden
[1:56:48] see there
[1:56:51] she didn't blame this on some other soul
[1:56:55] [Music]
[1:56:56] he didn't blame this on her her other
[1:56:58] husband no sir
[1:57:01] she took she took it on herself
[1:57:04] you know when he went places she went
[1:57:06] with him she was her her wife he was her
[1:57:10] husband
[1:57:11] but there was places she wanted to go
[1:57:13] that he wouldn't go yeah
[1:57:15] she wanted to go to some of the revivals
[1:57:17] we ain't going to church
[1:57:19] first husband headship
[1:57:24] led by the spirit through the senses of
[1:57:26] the body through memory emotion
[1:57:28] imagination no faith reasoning come on
[1:57:33] no faith
[1:57:35] he didn't like it
[1:57:38] I pray pray thee forgive the trespass of
[1:57:41] thine handmaiden for the Lord will
[1:57:44] certainly make my Lord a sure house
[1:57:49] well
[1:57:50] she prophesying amen she's speaking
[1:57:54] under inspiration God is moving on her
[1:57:56] and and look David he's looking
[1:58:00] and he's saying hey
[1:58:02] there's something going on here you
[1:58:04] better believe it kind of like Brother
[1:58:06] Richard would say there's something
[1:58:08] going on here
[1:58:12] you know I don't do that but I like that
[1:58:15] he don't do it for show that's just
[1:58:17] that's just that hillbilly
[1:58:21] wow wow that's good ain't it
[1:58:28] because that's who he is
[1:58:31] if I go out trying to be like that I'd
[1:58:33] be popping my suspenders and everything
[1:58:35] else
[1:58:36] I wouldn't be me
[1:58:38] but I like to be a little bit like him
[1:58:41] it's like
[1:58:45] so it's now she says certainly
[1:58:48] the Lord will certainly make my Lord a
[1:58:52] sure house isn't that what God said he
[1:58:54] was going to do with David he was going
[1:58:56] to make him a sure house and there would
[1:58:59] always be seed to be on the throne and
[1:59:01] that was fulfilled in Christ is that
[1:59:03] right
[1:59:06] of the Lord and evil hath not
[1:59:09] sure house because my Lord fighteth the
[1:59:12] battles of the Lord and evil hath not
[1:59:15] been found in thee all thy days
[1:59:19] now watch yet a man is risen in Pursuit
[1:59:22] Of Thee Saul
[1:59:25] prophesying
[1:59:27] and to seek thy soul
[1:59:30] but the soul of my Lord shall be bound
[1:59:32] in the bundle of life
[1:59:35] with the Lord thy God your life
[1:59:39] is bundled
[1:59:41] in the hand of the Lord
[1:59:45] open heart surgery
[1:59:46] car wrecks come on
[1:59:49] Satan seeking your life not just to take
[1:59:52] it but to discourage you but your life
[1:59:56] is bound in the bundle of not life but
[2:00:01] eternal life
[2:00:02] sealed unto the day of your Redemption
[2:00:07] look how she's speaking and David knows
[2:00:11] as he's a spiritual man and there's a
[2:00:13] spiritual woman and she's speaking
[2:00:18] listen when that woman that was bowed
[2:00:21] down to Jesus
[2:00:22] healed my daughter well we don't you
[2:00:25] know the the children's bread is not for
[2:00:28] dogs your old Gentile dog you know
[2:00:32] he didn't cut no slack
[2:00:34] no sir he wasn't being hateful
[2:00:37] but all of a sudden she says she says
[2:00:41] Lord and he says oh where'd that come
[2:00:45] from
[2:00:46] that came from the father inspiration he
[2:00:49] didn't see he didn't see no pill or Fire
[2:00:51] come down but he knew that God was
[2:00:54] dealing with her because
[2:00:55] he opened the door
[2:00:59] he opened the door
[2:01:02] man you know Grace is out here
[2:01:05] they believe it but do you know you have
[2:01:06] to access that Grace
[2:01:09] and the only way to access Grace is
[2:01:11] through faith
[2:01:12] by Jesus Christ
[2:01:15] not faith in Christ but the Faith of
[2:01:17] Christ
[2:01:20] so now she's prophesying
[2:01:23] and it shall come to pass
[2:01:25] when the Lord shall have done to my Lord
[2:01:28] according to all the goodness
[2:01:31] that he has spoken concerning thee all
[2:01:33] the prophecies
[2:01:35] when he was anointed king
[2:01:37] she knew who he was hey amen and she
[2:01:41] knew God and she knew the word of God
[2:01:45] and she believed the word of God she
[2:01:48] said David
[2:01:50] look at Jonathan David
[2:01:53] you know Jonathan was the next heir to
[2:01:56] the throne that was his throne he said
[2:01:59] David
[2:02:00] when you come to your throne
[2:02:03] he had already accepted the kingship of
[2:02:05] David you're talking about a spiritual
[2:02:08] man amen he wasn't jealous over that
[2:02:10] throne
[2:02:11] no sir he said David when you come to
[2:02:13] the throne remember my children she said
[2:02:16] David
[2:02:17] when you come to the throne Hallelujah
[2:02:20] not if you come to the throne it don't
[2:02:22] look like it comes to the throne
[2:02:25] but she said when you come to the throne
[2:02:28] amen remember thy handmaiden hallelujah
[2:02:31] oh man you go on down there and read man
[2:02:34] he looks at he and he says surely the
[2:02:37] Lord has sent you he recognizes the
[2:02:40] presence of the Lord he recognizes the
[2:02:43] inspiration of God you know sometimes
[2:02:45] you can recognize when God is dealing
[2:02:48] with somebody not because they're
[2:02:50] jumping shouting and dancing around it's
[2:02:52] because there's something going on on
[2:02:55] the inside and you see God dealing with
[2:02:58] somebody not just their brain
[2:03:01] she said Lord and he responded not just
[2:03:04] to her but he responded to the father he
[2:03:08] opened the door through her and she said
[2:03:10] Lord because he was Lord to the Gentiles
[2:03:14] not the seed of David
[2:03:16] we'll meet him in the air listen he's
[2:03:19] the son of man but when you and I meet
[2:03:22] him in the air he's going to be son of
[2:03:23] David
[2:03:25] we're meeting a king yes you better
[2:03:27] believe it
[2:03:29] because we're a bride
[2:03:31] we're the queen
[2:03:37] so what's he do he forgives her
[2:03:40] he says you're forgiven
[2:03:43] okay so now she's Justified
[2:03:47] Glory but there's a problem that you
[2:03:49] can't get married yet that's true
[2:03:53] first husband still a problem
[2:03:55] God's going to take care of it
[2:03:58] he don't go home and say
[2:04:00] oh Lord kill nabal so I can marry David
[2:04:03] no
[2:04:04] she goes back to her wedding vows
[2:04:07] she goes back to David or to stand that
[2:04:10] neighbor right that's it and then when
[2:04:12] he solves up the next day he tells her
[2:04:14] about him he tells her tells him about
[2:04:16] everything yeah
[2:04:18] and then about three days later
[2:04:20] God touches him
[2:04:22] and he's dead
[2:04:24] now she's sanctified
[2:04:28] beautiful
[2:04:29] is that right exactly right now she's
[2:04:32] free
[2:04:33] to do whatever she's independent
[2:04:36] Independence Day
[2:04:39] hallelujah we're free we're independent
[2:04:42] that
[2:04:46] because a woman can't have children by
[2:04:49] herself
[2:04:50] that's the fruit of the marriage is that
[2:04:51] right that's exactly right and she's
[2:04:53] going to bring fruit on to God
[2:04:57] and so David hears about nabal
[2:05:00] and he proposes to her and she responds
[2:05:04] and she's born again baptism of the Holy
[2:05:07] Spirit she's United with David and
[2:05:09] brings forth the life that I now live
[2:05:12] [Music]
[2:05:15] the lives that I now live
[2:05:17] out of the abundance of my heart
[2:05:20] beautiful creating me yes
[2:05:23] David knew there was a problem
[2:05:26] and he knew the problem wasn't up here
[2:05:29] and you knew the problem was down here
[2:05:33] man that's why we got to come to Calvary
[2:05:35] the problem was not up here
[2:05:37] the problems down here the psychiatrists
[2:05:40] can't handle it nope
[2:05:42] the preacher can't handle it no Mom and
[2:05:46] Daddy can't handle it might be able to
[2:05:48] give you some material yeah
[2:05:50] they might be able to give you some
[2:05:52] instruments
[2:05:53] they might be able to give you some word
[2:05:56] to lead you to him
[2:05:58] but you've got to find them
[2:06:02] send I lied
[2:06:04] and thy truth that it might lead me to
[2:06:07] your dwelling place to your Tabernacles
[2:06:12] and in thy light
[2:06:15] I'll see light yes
[2:06:17] he looked at Jesus he was the light of
[2:06:19] the world Amen
[2:06:22] John said they'll look at you you're the
[2:06:24] light of the world
[2:06:26] but they won't see light
[2:06:28] they only see Darkness
[2:06:32] I was I was looking at the
[2:06:34] in the motel room there's a clock and it
[2:06:37] was right by my head
[2:06:39] and I was looking to see what time it
[2:06:41] was and I went to sleep and I woke up
[2:06:43] about 5 20.
[2:06:45] and I looked at the clock
[2:06:48] and you know how when you wake up in the
[2:06:50] morning sometimes you'll have your eyes
[2:06:52] will be kind of foggy
[2:06:53] and I looked at that clock and it was
[2:06:56] foggy
[2:06:57] I thought oh no
[2:06:59] got service counting on again
[2:07:04] and that thing was so foggy
[2:07:06] I couldn't I couldn't hardly read it it
[2:07:08] was so foggy
[2:07:11] you know the the Bible said the veil was
[2:07:13] on our hearts there it is brother
[2:07:18] I wanted to read a scripture
[2:07:21] old people talk a lot you know
[2:07:24] blessing Lord Ecclesiastes three and
[2:07:27] eleven you go read it they said he put
[2:07:29] the world in their heart
[2:07:31] that they might not find out his words
[2:07:34] I always preach that as the Veil
[2:07:38] but that's not what it says I was
[2:07:40] looking at the other day that said that
[2:07:42] word he put the world in her heart it
[2:07:44] meant eternity
[2:07:47] so then if I read it that way he put
[2:07:49] eternity into their heart
[2:07:51] and they won't be able to find my works
[2:07:53] and I thought that's strange
[2:07:57] so I got to looking at it and it says
[2:08:00] that word actually means a sense of
[2:08:03] purpose
[2:08:05] you know have you ever been doing
[2:08:08] something or walking on
[2:08:11] and there was a sense of danger that's
[2:08:13] one that's one of the words it uses in
[2:08:15] the dictionary a sense of danger Are you
[2:08:18] standing in a store and you feel like
[2:08:20] somebody's staring at you and you're
[2:08:21] thinking
[2:08:22] man I got this sense it's kind of like a
[2:08:25] fog
[2:08:26] kind of like looking at that clock
[2:08:33] oh
[2:08:34] man I feel like somebody's staring at me
[2:08:36] you look over
[2:08:38] and there's somebody looking at you and
[2:08:39] you thought oh
[2:08:40] are you are you standing in a room or
[2:08:42] something and all of a sudden you feel
[2:08:44] this presence a sense come on you can't
[2:08:47] feel the heat you can't smell it you
[2:08:50] can't hear nothing there's just this
[2:08:52] sense
[2:08:53] and you turn around it oh I didn't know
[2:08:55] you was in here
[2:08:57] it's a synth of purpose
[2:09:01] that only God can satisfy
[2:09:05] but it's like a fog
[2:09:10] you know you why am I here yeah come on
[2:09:13] where'd it come from
[2:09:15] where am I going there's a sense and God
[2:09:18] put it down in there but he put a veil
[2:09:20] to where you can't find out the work of
[2:09:22] God
[2:09:23] he has to reveal it to you
[2:09:27] so start getting light in the room this
[2:09:29] morning
[2:09:30] I said man I just can't believe this my
[2:09:32] eyes ain't got cleared up yet
[2:09:34] and I looked over there
[2:09:36] and my wife had thrown the slip over the
[2:09:39] over the clock so that it wouldn't be
[2:09:42] shining in my face
[2:09:43] and I said
[2:09:45] oh and I moved the Veil
[2:09:51] [Applause]
[2:09:56] let's stand by our heads this morning
[2:10:03] you know
[2:10:05] in all of Abigail's experience it never
[2:10:08] changed her character
[2:10:11] but when she married David she could go
[2:10:13] to church because he went to church he'd
[2:10:16] go to Revival she went to revivals
[2:10:18] she could go anywhere she wanted because
[2:10:21] they were both spiritual people
[2:10:25] Liberty
[2:10:27] Liberty is not always what people thinks
[2:10:30] Liberty is it's not the freedom to do
[2:10:33] evil
[2:10:34] is not Grace To Live unlawfully
[2:10:37] sir it's to be free it's to be the real
[2:10:40] you
[2:10:41] that you were from before the
[2:10:43] foundations of the world
[2:10:45] and you've been liberated
[2:10:48] this is our anniversary day
[2:10:51] United States is celebrating her
[2:10:54] anniversary of Liberty yeah but her
[2:10:57] Liberty
[2:11:00] she was prepared to a sanctuary in the
[2:11:03] wilderness for a woman for a period of
[2:11:06] time
[2:11:08] she is about to lose her Liberty but you
[2:11:12] can never lose your Liberty Hallelujah
[2:11:19] as we bow our heads this morning
[2:11:21] heavenly father and sorry we took so
[2:11:24] long
[2:11:25] but father I pray there's something here
[2:11:27] to encourage the people to establish
[2:11:31] this in Redemption
[2:11:33] to establish us in your word it's not a
[2:11:37] fantasy
[2:11:40] Lord I know what it was to walk that day
[2:11:44] and to know that I was eternally lost
[2:11:47] and there was no Redemption for me it
[2:11:50] was cut off
[2:11:51] but oh Lord you gave me light amen at
[2:11:55] the end of the tunnel you just wanted to
[2:11:57] see what I would do
[2:11:59] and Lord it wasn't by faith
[2:12:02] it was only by love
[2:12:04] that had been birthed into my heart
[2:12:10] Lord like Ruth
[2:12:12] there was nothing
[2:12:14] that she would reap positive by going
[2:12:16] with Naomi
[2:12:18] no more children no husband under the
[2:12:21] hand of Judgment of God it looked like
[2:12:25] but yet she was willing she'd heard
[2:12:27] something about this Jehovah
[2:12:29] and she was wanting to know more and she
[2:12:32] was willing to suffer persecution
[2:12:33] judgment
[2:12:35] so without reward she served him served
[2:12:39] her and went with her
[2:12:42] oh it's it's not by reward
[2:12:45] like Paul said none of these things move
[2:12:47] me
[2:12:50] Lord in our search for you as Moses
[2:12:55] Lord in in David's loving you
[2:12:59] we not only found you but we loved you
[2:13:03] and Paul
[2:13:05] is living for you
[2:13:07] yes that none of these things moved him
[2:13:13] This Is The Life
[2:13:15] that I now live
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:21] this is eternal life
[2:13:25] Lord I know there's many
[2:13:28] Lord me
[2:13:29] Lord we need physical strength touch
[2:13:32] from you
[2:13:36] we thank you for all that you've done
[2:13:38] but it just seemed like man we're always
[2:13:40] like little children needing help yes
[2:13:43] there's challenges that's facing us some
[2:13:46] of us there's serious challenges and
[2:13:49] decisions to be made
[2:13:51] and we're it's like a fog we're not
[2:13:54] exactly
[2:13:55] sure Lord just remove the veil off the
[2:13:59] clock
[2:14:00] so that we can read it clearly
[2:14:02] and that you'll Shine the Light in our
[2:14:05] path one step at a time one day at a
[2:14:08] time
[2:14:09] just lead us like children yes Lord and

[2:14:33] seek your presence we seek conference

[2:14:47] well we all are represented in her

[2:15:04] Christ in me that liveth
[2:15:08] and I live by the faith
