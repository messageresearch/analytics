[13:32] service into thy hand all the brothers
[13:35] and sisters gather together here Lord to
[13:37] Worship You Lord you pray we pray Lord
[13:39] that you'll bless each and every one of
[13:41] them Lord in the name of Jesus we pray
[13:44] amen please be
[13:51] seated I express you the desire of her
[13:55] heart that the Lord has really how as a
[13:59] whole family has led us to come to
[14:03] Israel and the Lord was moving on behalf
[14:08] of
[14:08] us in the hearts of our brothers in in
[14:13] United
[14:14] States I told you that it's been almost
[14:17] 22 years that I could not come to States
[14:21] and to have fellowship with the Brethren
[14:24] but I had a good relation with brother
[14:26] Humes and their family so
[14:30] one in the
[14:32] 1997 dad Humes had been to India and
[14:36] that time I met him but when he came
[14:38] back here then he got sick and you all
[14:42] know that he's on bed and he's in the
[14:44] nursing home then he had a great desire
[14:48] in his
[14:49] heart
[14:51] that he wanted to meet me one time
[14:55] before the Lord takes him away and he
[14:59] Express that desire to brother team many
[15:01] a times and brother team called me few
[15:06] uh uh 2 years back or something and he
[15:09] says brother dad is on on the bed and
[15:14] he's suffering with Parkinson's disease
[15:18] and the dad has very much desire to meet
[15:21] you before the Lord takes him my way so
[15:25] I did not put much of a thought on those
[15:28] things and I said brother I will be
[15:30] praying and uh I'll see how the Lord
[15:34] just makes my way because I had put
[15:38] before the Lord in the back days
[15:41] whenever I come to come to United States
[15:43] in those days in 1981 to
[15:46] 87 I always paid my
[15:49] way I always purchased my ticket to come
[15:53] to
[15:54] States even for the first time when I
[15:56] came in 81 I bought my ticket
[15:59] and I came to United States I preach
[16:02] here had a good Fellowship of the
[16:04] Brethren met many Brethren and Lord just
[16:07] blessed me and by the way the they
[16:10] offered me the gifts on offerings and
[16:15] that made to make my payment of the on
[16:19] on the ticket you know and I could get
[16:22] that b back but nobody sponsored me as
[16:25] as uh to come to United States so then I
[16:28] I just kept in the Lord and I said Lord
[16:31] I'm not going no more to United States
[16:34] unless and until somebody pays my
[16:37] ticket I I just let left it to the Lord
[16:41] and I said Lord I'm not
[16:42] going and I was just like that and it's
[16:45] been almost 22 years and brother team
[16:49] came to Israel 2 years back with brother
[16:53] uh brother Jos Smith and the group there
[16:56] and my sons they went to their hotel
[16:59] where where they were staying and they
[17:01] spend the evening time with them they
[17:03] had a good fellowship and they talked on
[17:05] many of the things there and then
[17:08] brother te on the group they came back
[17:10] to his States then again he called me to
[17:13] India I was that time in India so he
[17:16] called me and he was very glad to meet
[17:18] my sons and he says brother I wish I
[17:20] could meet you but uh he said then he
[17:22] expressed that you come over come to
[17:25] States uh one time and then he Express
[17:29] the desire he says we will pay the
[17:31] ticket for you and I said Lord that's
[17:34] the answer and still I couldn't come I
[17:38] had many things to be done then this
[17:41] February he came to Israel by himself he
[17:46] was on his tour to go to n uh to uh some
[17:50] place in uh Africa and he knew that I
[17:54] was there in Israel so he called me and
[17:57] he said brother I'm making a a special
[17:59] trip I have to go to Africa but I'll
[18:02] come first to Israel I'll be with you
[18:05] I'll spend some time with you and then
[18:07] from there I'll go to Africa I want to
[18:09] meet you personally so I said well
[18:12] brother you come you're most welcome and
[18:14] it's your own home I said you come so he
[18:18] came and he stayed with us and we spent
[18:22] some time in fellowship and we just Shar
[18:25] a lot of things and then he said brother
[18:28] now you must make a point to come and to
[18:30] see Dad I said okay now the time has
[18:33] come and when I went back to India in Fe
[18:37] in March after meeting brother brother
[18:40] Tim and the Lord just put these thoughts
[18:42] in my heart and when the Lord put these
[18:45] thoughts
[18:47] about we being a church in Israel then I
[18:51] said no I have to go to States and meet
[18:53] the brothers because the Indian ministry
[18:57] we handled those Ministries in India and
[19:00] we did good and Lord blessed us and
[19:02] helped us in every way but when to start
[19:07] the ministry in Israel it's a little bit
[19:10] hard on us we because in in Israel if I
[19:13] have to start a Ministry I cannot start
[19:16] in my home because we are living among
[19:19] all the all the Jewish people all around
[19:21] us you know we are living right in the
[19:24] in the people in the in the apartments
[19:26] where we have we are living is every
[19:30] everywhere left right up and down in the
[19:33] apartments there you know all is all the
[19:35] Jewish people we live in a right among
[19:37] them and if we start a congregation like
[19:39] there in those place it's not good and
[19:43] we may be in difficulty so we have to
[19:46] have rent a a small hall or small place
[19:50] where we can bring the people together
[19:52] and worship and to start that first of
[19:55] all I have to get registered with the
[19:57] government obious Israel and it's going
[20:00] to take more money that we could spend
[20:04] on on the mission on the work in in
[20:07] India and this uh other place so we had
[20:10] I had been praying and then I thought
[20:13] and the Lord just put me in my heart
[20:14] that now is the time that I need a
[20:17] support from the brothers in the States
[20:21] because it's difficult in Israel my my
[20:24] sons actually couldn't buy a house in
[20:27] there so they had to rent a house and we
[20:30] are the boys are paying two bedroom um
[20:33] two bedroom flat $1,000 $1,100 per month
[20:38] it's it's expensive in India in Israel
[20:42] and to buy a house it's more expensive
[20:46] and the things are not that good for at
[20:49] least for this time of uh the time for
[20:53] my children to buy a house or to make
[20:56] some arrangement to start a church
[20:58] church or to place where I can get the
[21:00] brothers to come together so we'll have
[21:02] to rent a house rent a hall or some
[21:05] place and to rent a rent a hall it
[21:09] certainly needs a good money there are
[21:11] churches the I talking about you about
[21:14] the mic churches mic groups and there
[21:16] are some groups that they are going
[21:18] there that uh holding their meetings
[21:21] they express their desire that that we
[21:24] come together with them and share that
[21:27] Hall but at at the same time they said
[21:29] the time which is allotted them he said
[21:32] we take a half time and you take half
[21:34] time you bring together all all we come
[21:37] together and worship together you can
[21:39] preach one hour and I will preach on one
[21:41] hour but I said no because I know that
[21:45] when we start preaching see don't people
[21:48] those people will not be able to stand
[21:50] it and then you know the things will not
[21:53] be right and we'll have to separate so I
[21:56] I told them no I'm sorry I said I cannot
[21:58] do that because when I look U you know
[22:02] the times to come then I I said it will
[22:04] not be a good thing because when we
[22:06] separate see there are there two things
[22:09] happens either you pull the people from
[22:11] him or he pulls the people from you you
[22:14] know and it won't look good you know
[22:16] because uh if the people from his group
[22:19] likes to join us then it will be a
[22:22] difficult you know and then you will
[22:24] have a bad name you know among the
[22:26] groups and among the churches so I told
[22:28] them no brother I said if at all I have
[22:31] to start I may just go with a small
[22:34] little place where we can gather the
[22:36] people and start there so when I go back
[22:40] we are looking forward to find out a
[22:42] good place that we could get into it and
[22:45] get registered with the government and
[22:48] then we start the uh Outreach people and
[22:52] and start the congregation there so I
[22:54] want you all to pray for that and if the
[22:57] Lord leads you you can share your part
[23:00] in it and it will be a very great
[23:02] blessing and we're looking forward in
[23:04] the days to come that if the group comes
[23:07] from here like the last time the people
[23:09] come Lord willing you'll find a place to
[23:12] come together and to Worship in in in
[23:14] the message and in the faith that we
[23:17] have received and that will be a great
[23:19] blessing and so then I decided so no
[23:23] this is the call of the Lord that the
[23:25] Lord has made through dad Humes and
[23:28] through R tee him for me to come or to
[23:31] State and he paid my ticket not only me
[23:34] he paid my wife's ticket also so it was
[23:37] just on on the way you know and the Lord
[23:39] just answered my prayer I said Lord
[23:42] thank you for answering my prayer so
[23:44] it's been a great blessing for me to
[23:46] come over here and to meet different
[23:48] this time when I come almost every place
[23:51] I went are the new brothers very few in
[23:55] all the old times I talked to Brother D
[23:57] and I said brother uh those those
[23:59] brothers that I used to have fellowship
[24:01] with in the in the'80s I said they are
[24:03] all now the old-timers like brother how
[24:06] Carol brother Jess tble and brother
[24:08] Jerry Ro and brother Albert green and
[24:11] brother Wilson Henry has just gone to to
[24:13] son it's almost like to some other
[24:15] country is gone so you know it's getting
[24:18] difficult you know to meet but now by
[24:20] God's grace that I could come in
[24:22] fellowship with different new brothers
[24:24] that really I know are are going you
[24:27] know strong in the faith in the word of
[24:29] God in the message and I'm very glad to
[24:32] see the situation now is being changed
[24:34] in the United States that time when I
[24:37] was coming here I had a lot of
[24:39] difficulty in getting along with the
[24:41] brothers because because lot of things
[24:45] that time had been spreaded Out Among
[24:48] the brothers in different different kind
[24:49] of teachings you know everybody wants to
[24:52] take something out of it out of the
[24:54] message of brother Bram and and to say
[24:56] that no I got this thing
[24:58] I don't want to mention those things but
[25:01] I had a very you know bad experience on
[25:03] those years and you know that kind of
[25:05] made my heart sad and I just stayed back
[25:08] home you know in India I said Lord I
[25:10] don't want to get involved in such kind
[25:12] of in any kind of things you know
[25:13] something might jump on you and if you
[25:16] take that back home in India it's gone I
[25:19] know and the churches in India uh are
[25:23] and the message people in India are
[25:25] right now are in many places don't have
[25:28] proper teaching and have in in a
[25:31] different kind of ideas and and the
[25:33] thoughts that the the brothers have
[25:35] taken back to India so I thank God that
[25:38] the Lord I always uh tell the Brethren
[25:41] and and myself I observe this thing as
[25:43] the prophet says that walk in the middle
[25:45] of the road and I always like to walk in
[25:48] the middle of the road and I'm thankful
[25:50] to the Lord that if those days if I
[25:53] would have just said to the brother okay
[25:54] praise the Lord Brother amen what you
[25:56] are saying is is the message you know
[26:00] you understand that you know I could
[26:01] have just clicked to them and I would I
[26:04] in somewhere else you know today but I
[26:06] praise God that the Lord at the which
[26:08] place the Lord has kept me I'm thankful
[26:11] to the Lord that I am honest to him
[26:14] whatever you know things as the the
[26:17] children saying that whatever things
[26:19] come on my way you know I'm going to be
[26:23] you know with the Lord I'm going to stay
[26:24] there right in there and that's been my
[26:27] experience that this my life has been my
[26:30] Ministry and the Lord has blessed us in
[26:33] those things so pray about it and the
[26:36] Lord will surely lead you to do
[26:38] something for Israel the part of the
[26:42] body of Christ that's going to start in
[26:45] Israel it's already started we are there
[26:47] as an we are there eight people now uh
[26:50] my three sons daughter myself my wife my
[26:54] daughter-in-law my Elder s Elder son's
[26:56] wife and our one one grandchild so we
[27:00] are there and we are more than three
[27:02] people two people the Lord says where
[27:04] are two or three are gathered in my name
[27:07] it says I am in the midst so that's the
[27:10] church so I believe that the Lord has
[27:13] started his work in Israel and we pray
[27:16] that it will continue to to go on to go
[27:19] on till the Lord comes there and and
[27:22] takes his bride away because this is the
[27:24] time that everything is just coming to
[27:28] the end right praise God Amen the
[27:31] message as we have read this scripture
[27:34] it says in the Hebrews 10th the first
[27:37] verse it says for the law having a
[27:40] shadow of good things to come and not
[27:43] the very image of the things
[27:46] see Paul here is talking not about the
[27:50] image not about the
[27:53] Shadows but here he's talking something
[27:56] good things that has to come amen right
[28:00] means he is looking beyond the things GL
[28:04] which already happened in the past but
[28:08] they are the
[28:09] shadows and brother Bram
[28:12] preach and Paradox and he says the
[28:15] Shadows are not the real but they give
[28:18] you the idea or tells you that what the
[28:21] the image belongs to like if the shadow
[28:24] of the elephant is then then you can
[28:26] know that that's the ele elephant and
[28:29] that's the shadow of the elephant but
[28:31] the shadow is not a
[28:33] reality reality is the original amen and
[28:37] we are looking for the original things
[28:40] right but the shadow gives us an idea
[28:44] amen it it expands our
[28:46] imagination it tells you something
[28:49] that's beyond that shadow right and that
[28:53] brings then it brings you to the reality
[28:56] and that's how here the Paul is
[28:58] specially mentioning about the things of
[29:01] the past he says there those images and
[29:06] those Shadows which were in the back
[29:08] days and he's mentioning then about the
[29:11] sacrifices they offered so means he's
[29:14] linking those shadows and the images for
[29:17] in the back days and through the
[29:20] scripture this evening I like to bring
[29:23] you few shadows and then the realities
[29:27] which are given in the Bible I gone
[29:29] through by God's grace turned pages and
[29:32] pages and the Lord has shown me the
[29:36] Shadows that has become the reality in
[29:40] the New Testament we know every one of
[29:42] us knows that the New Testament is the
[29:46] Fulfillment of the Old Testament right
[29:49] and that means that the Old Testament is
[29:51] a shadow right of the good things and
[29:54] good things are the Messiah right our
[29:57] savior here his
[29:59] sacrifice the Salvation God come down in
[30:03] human flesh God in us and then we see
[30:06] the Shadow and the in the reality then
[30:09] we see of the coming of the Lord so
[30:11] that's the reality the shadow is the Old
[30:15] Testament I like to just bring you a few
[30:18] things out of the
[30:21] scriptures the start to start with we
[30:24] see that God Called Moses and then he
[30:28] send him back to the children of Israel
[30:31] and to the Pharaoh and then he said that
[30:34] you take a
[30:36] lamb and you kill the lamb and take the
[30:40] blood and apply on the
[30:42] doorpost and then it says that's your
[30:47] Passover that's your Passover so the
[30:51] blood which is on the
[30:53] doorpost that will save your lives as
[30:57] the angel will pass through that door
[31:00] through over that house and the death
[31:03] will not be able to enter into that
[31:05] house right because that blood of the
[31:08] Lamb is there and that's how when we see
[31:12] in the word of God that that shadow that
[31:16] was a shadow that was not the reality
[31:19] that was how the Lord was teaching his
[31:21] people that without the shedding of the
[31:24] blood there is no forgiveness of sin
[31:27] there is no life life if you have to
[31:29] have life you have to have the shedding
[31:31] of the blood and then the God was taking
[31:34] that pattern that shadow that image to
[31:38] the Passover of Jesus Christ right
[31:41] that's what we have in the book of
[31:42] Corinthians Paul says that Jesus is our
[31:45] Passover amen exactly so this was the
[31:48] shadow but this was the reality right
[31:51] this Shadow couldn't take away the sin
[31:54] but this reality could take away the sin
[31:56] and permanently
[31:58] right not for just for a year because
[32:01] every year they come now now in Israel
[32:04] there is there is a um yon kipur right
[32:08] the day of the atonement see every year
[32:11] they come back and they kill the lamb
[32:13] for the remission of the sin of the
[32:15] whole nation so every year there has to
[32:18] come but now when the reality is come
[32:22] it's no more sacrifice now because
[32:25] that's the reality that's the truth
[32:27] that's that's that's the original
[32:29] sacrifice and that was shown in Shadows
[32:33] to his people but the reality was Jesus
[32:37] Christ amen that he is our Passover and
[32:40] whosoever taketh that blood that death
[32:44] he will pass over to life the Lord says
[32:47] that whosoever believeth on me has
[32:50] passed from Death unto life right so now
[32:54] no more death on his people come on not
[32:57] even the death the second death come on
[32:59] he says whose whose names are written in
[33:02] that book of life he says they are not
[33:04] under that second death they have passed
[33:07] from Death un life amen and we have
[33:09] entered into that life we have received
[33:12] that salvation we have received that
[33:14] forgiveness of sin because of the
[33:16] reality which came 2,000 years back amen
[33:19] the Lord said gave those Shadows gave
[33:21] their images to to see the original to
[33:24] see the reality and they looked
[33:28] and looked and unto that sacrifice on
[33:31] the cross on that doorpost the blood was
[33:34] on their doorpost then the scripture
[33:36] says then if we go further then the word
[33:39] of God says that Moses took them through
[33:44] the waters that is the sea the the Red
[33:48] Sea when they passed through the Red Sea
[33:50] the waters were on the both side and the
[33:53] sky was above them what is that the
[33:56] scripture says in the Corinth book of
[33:58] Corinthians and it says that that is the
[34:01] baptism of Moses that they went through
[34:04] right so what was that that was not the
[34:07] reality that was the image of the coming
[34:09] of the baptism in the name of the Lord
[34:11] Jesus Christ they cross over through the
[34:14] L through the waters both the side
[34:16] Waters and above the cloud that was what
[34:19] was that that was a shadow and a image
[34:22] of the coming the reality of the baptism
[34:25] of Jesus Christ glory and here we come
[34:28] and we take the baptism we go right into
[34:30] the water amen that's the real baptism
[34:34] but the shadow was with Moses they took
[34:36] the scripture says that they took the
[34:38] baptism of
[34:40] Moses they come out then from there and
[34:43] they come to the Mount HB and there we
[34:47] see Mount siai and then they come to
[34:50] mount siai there we see that they the
[34:53] Lord came down in fire right and the
[34:56] whole Mountain was trembling people got
[34:58] scared and it was all just like a fire
[35:02] and smoke was coming out of that whole
[35:04] Mountain what was that that was the
[35:06] shadow shadow of the fire coming down on
[35:10] the day of the Pentecost amen and that
[35:13] was the reality so we see that the God
[35:16] come down in that fire and here on that
[35:18] mountain and here we come that God come
[35:20] down in a tongues and of fire and leing
[35:25] among all his disciples and they were
[35:28] filled with the Holy Ghost right so that
[35:30] was the original that was the reality
[35:34] God came down in in his
[35:36] people and there we see that how the
[35:39] Lord started his work so now here they
[35:42] took the water baptism they took the
[35:45] baptism of fire and spirit and they came
[35:48] to the land of Palestinian and there the
[35:51] lord gave that land into their hands and
[35:54] they fought the War through josua and KH
[35:58] and they took the whole land under the
[36:00] under their possession and then there
[36:03] came a time that there was no more war
[36:07] there was no more fight everything was
[36:10] peace and the scripture says if you turn
[36:12] with me in the Book of
[36:16] Joshua 21st
[36:20] chapter 21st chapter 43rd verse and the
[36:24] 45th
[36:26] verse
[36:34] excuse
[36:35] [Music]
[36:42] me and it
[36:44] says God and the lord gave unto Israel
[36:48] all the land which he swear to give unto
[36:51] their fathers and they possessed it and
[36:54] dwelt therein the lord gave them raced
[36:58] round about according to all that he
[37:01] swear unto their
[37:04] fathers and there stood no man no not a
[37:07] man of all their enemies before them the
[37:09] Lord delivered all their enemies into
[37:11] their land right and the here scripture
[37:14] says that the lord gave them rest
[37:17] roundabout amen and they were in peace
[37:22] there was no war there was no fighting
[37:25] everything was just in peace so we you
[37:27] see if this is the shadow then there has
[37:31] to be a reality and it will come into
[37:34] reality that the
[37:36] church we see was in a war right war
[37:41] against the principalities and the power
[37:44] of the demons and sinan that the church
[37:47] had to fight it its war and everywhere
[37:51] whever they go they they were persecuted
[37:54] they were put in prison they were beaten
[37:57] and Steven was killed and all this was
[38:00] war was going on in the in in the church
[38:03] and the war and the Believers were all
[38:05] all of them engag in this Warfare of
[38:09] course this was this war was not of
[38:12] blood and flesh but this was the war
[38:15] against the spirit and the
[38:16] principalities of which were moving in
[38:18] the Heavenly places
[38:21] so this war was going on in the church
[38:24] at the time of Paul and Peter but the
[38:26] scripture says in the book of Acts and
[38:29] the 9th
[38:31] chapter and the 31st
[38:37] verse and it
[38:41] says then had the churches raised
[38:45] throughout all Judea and Galilee and
[38:47] Samaria and were edified right the
[38:51] church had their
[38:53] rest all these
[38:55] years there was war
[38:58] the whenever they went for preaching
[39:01] they were persecuted beaten
[39:03] sick Stone uh stoned but now there come
[39:08] a time in the church that there the word
[39:11] of God says then had the churches rest
[39:14] throughout right in Joshua the word of
[39:18] God says that those people the lord gave
[39:21] them the rest amen and here the church
[39:24] the lord gave the church rest and it was
[39:27] AR rest in a reality in a spiritual
[39:30] sense we see but when the rest comes and
[39:34] the people are at ease then we see the
[39:37] people start to forsake God oh yeah then
[39:41] they go away from the blessings of the
[39:44] Lord they forget the blessing and then
[39:48] we see that they slip back lead goes
[39:52] away from the presence of the Lord and
[39:55] it so happened in the history of the
[39:59] Israelites we see that when the Lord
[40:02] blessed them they came to the the
[40:05] Palestinian land they took over the land
[40:08] they established their Kingdom and
[40:10] everything was just going on fine and
[40:12] there we see that they started to depart
[40:17] away from the Lord and then they started
[40:20] to worship different gods they started
[40:23] to worship Mo moabites gods they start
[40:26] to worship uh Bal gods and they started
[40:29] to worship esto and all the goddesses
[40:32] and then not only that they started even
[40:35] to sacrifice their own children for the
[40:38] moik gods and to Sun God and to Moon God
[40:42] so they fell away from the presence of
[40:45] the Lord they came out and the Lord God
[40:50] who many a times spoke to them through
[40:52] the prophets that I am the Lord your God
[40:55] who brought you out from the land of
[40:58] bondage I am the one that brought you
[41:00] out and still they didn't hear the cry
[41:04] or the warning of the Lords and they
[41:07] continue to do sin and sin against the
[41:10] Lord if this is the reality my dear
[41:13] friends this has to be in the church
[41:15] history right that's going to be a
[41:17] reality this is the shadow this is the
[41:21] image that we could see now in the
[41:23] church
[41:24] history there we see after Paul Peter
[41:28] gone Lord took them away and then we see
[41:31] few of the disciples who had the fir
[41:34] hand gospel received from Paul Peter and
[41:37] all all the apostles they walked with
[41:39] God in righteousness they walked
[41:42] according to the scriptures which was
[41:44] handed over to them but then in the
[41:47] years to come then we see the church
[41:50] being drifted away right the church
[41:52] started to have the teaching of the
[41:55] nians right then we see the church
[41:58] started to have the teachings of the
[42:01] balam they started to have the teachings
[42:03] of the jizel they started to have in the
[42:07] church the the house of Satan which
[42:10] turned if you go into the LeRon in the
[42:12] in all all the seven churches you see
[42:15] that how that that the house of uh the
[42:18] congregation of Satan turned into the
[42:21] Throne of Satan in the church so that's
[42:24] how the church drifted away from the
[42:27] original right that the original state
[42:30] of the church and they went away from
[42:33] the God and started to worship and know
[42:36] and to leave the word of God away and to
[42:39] and to start to in a different type of
[42:42] teachings and doctrines and and all kind
[42:44] of things that come and crypt into the
[42:46] church so this was the situation but
[42:49] Lord warned
[42:51] isres all the time that come back to me
[42:55] I am your lord I I am your God come back
[42:59] to me and the Lord sent the prophets
[43:02] Lord sent Isaiah long Lord s uh Jeremiah
[43:07] and Lord sent Ezekiel Daniel all the
[43:10] prophets they come in Lord
[43:12] s Elijah and we see that those prophets
[43:16] came and they tried to bring the people
[43:20] back to God Amen and we we see that all
[43:23] they spoke against the the Israel to
[43:27] what they were doing and the Lord wanted
[43:30] them to come back to him I like to read
[43:33] scripture in the book of Jeremiah third
[43:36] chapter and there you see that how the
[43:38] Lord has pleaded with his people right
[43:42] to come back to
[43:44] him and beginning the third
[43:52] chapter and beginning with the first
[43:54] verse I read zeriah third chapter
[43:57] they say if a man put away his wife and
[43:59] she go from him and become another man
[44:02] shall be shall he return unto her again
[44:05] shall not that land be greatly polluted
[44:07] but thou H has played the hairl with
[44:10] many lovers yet return again to me said
[44:13] the Lord the Lord is talking to the
[44:16] children of Israel and the Lord is
[44:19] saying that see you play hang with many
[44:22] laws that means the idols many Idols
[44:25] that that the Israelite started
[44:27] worshiping but here the Lord says yet
[44:31] return again to me said the Lord right
[44:34] and still the Israelites didn't return
[44:38] unto the Lord and we see the lord always
[44:42] wanted his people to come back to him
[44:45] amen and but then again the Lord says in
[44:48] the second verse lift up thine eyes unto
[44:50] the high places and see where thou Hast
[44:53] not been L Lin with in the ways that
[44:56] thou has sat for them as the Arabian in
[44:59] the wilderness and thou H has polluted
[45:02] the land with thy hens and with thy
[45:05] wickedness so the whole children of
[45:09] Israel was under
[45:12] condemnation and under that condemnation
[45:15] the Lord judged that
[45:17] land but still Lord had a Grace upon
[45:21] that land because of the promise of
[45:24] Abraham and then we see it come up the
[45:27] King David and King Solomon and they
[45:30] built the temple and Solomon built the
[45:33] temple and he received the promise of
[45:35] God that whosoever look prays uh looking
[45:38] to that facing to that Temple the Lord
[45:41] will answer his prayers amen and there
[45:44] was a great great fire great cloud of
[45:48] fire upon that that that Temple when
[45:51] they dedicated that Temple to the Lord
[45:54] so that blessing they received but what
[45:56] happened
[45:58] this same Solomon King Solomon in the in
[46:01] the latter part of his life he started
[46:04] to worship idols and he became an idol
[46:07] worshipper and then the Lord had to come
[46:10] down on him and the Lord spoke to him
[46:13] that I'm going to take away the whole
[46:16] Kingdom from of Israel from you and I'm
[46:19] going to divide it in two kingdoms one
[46:22] one will be called Israel and the second
[46:24] will be called Judah the kingdom of
[46:26] Judah and the Kingdom of Israel and so
[46:29] we
[46:30] see that in the days in the Solomon then
[46:35] the Lord says I'll will not do it in
[46:36] your time but I'll do it in the time of
[46:39] your son to come so when the time come
[46:42] then we see the Lord divided this
[46:44] Kingdom and this kingdom was parted into
[46:48] two kingdoms that was the Kingdom of
[46:50] Israel and the kingdom of Judah right my
[46:53] dear friends if this is the shadow then
[46:56] there has to be a reality right that's
[46:59] there has to be reality and that reality
[47:02] that we can see through the IM through
[47:04] the shadow and the images which were we
[47:07] have in our Old Testament that to come
[47:09] to pass into the church history right
[47:12] the church went into Dark Ages the
[47:15] church went worshiping the idols the
[47:19] church brought Idols into the church
[47:21] into the church and started to worship
[47:24] those Idols God sent his messages in
[47:27] every Church age we see that there was a
[47:29] messenger to that church age and God had
[47:32] warned them and many times the Lord said
[47:35] come back to your original place come
[47:37] back to your original place and and to
[47:41] your original love and he says and then
[47:44] he says if you do not listen to me Obe
[47:47] to me then I will remove your candle
[47:50] from the place he warned all the time
[47:53] and we see in the back days the Lord
[47:55] warned the children of Israel
[47:57] but they did not listen to the Lord and
[47:59] then the Lord has to break that Kingdom
[48:02] and to make into two kingdoms in the
[48:05] same manner my dear friends if it's to
[48:07] be a reality God then given warning
[48:11] after warning warning after warning to
[48:13] the Christian world then the Lord came
[48:15] to a place and the Lord divided the
[48:18] whole Christianity into two parts and
[48:21] that's Catholicism and the
[48:25] protest that's true my dear friends no
[48:28] more other part if you take a whole
[48:31] world Christian world see they are the
[48:33] people they call them themselves
[48:36] Catholics and then there are other
[48:37] people they call thems
[48:40] Protestants the God took
[48:43] away the the kingdom and broke that
[48:47] Kingdom of catholism because the
[48:49] catholism we see that went against God
[48:52] oh yeah and how that they went against
[48:55] God we see in the first Kings and 12th
[49:01] chapter first king in the 12th
[49:06] chapter and the 28th and the 30th
[49:20] verse 1 King 12th chapter 28 and
[49:25] 30th
[49:34] and it says whereupon the king took
[49:37] counsel and made two cows of gold and
[49:40] said unto them it is too much for you to
[49:42] go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o
[49:45] Israel which brought thee up out of the
[49:48] land of Egypt and it said the one in
[49:50] Bethel and the other put he he in Dan
[49:54] and then it says and this thing became a
[49:57] sin for the people went to worship
[50:00] before the one even unto D so God
[50:03] divided the kingdom of
[50:05] Solomon Kingdom of David Kingdom of
[50:07] Judah and he gave one part to jobah yeah
[50:12] and the king jobah the scripture says
[50:15] whereupon the king took counsel and made
[50:18] two calves yeah he took the counsel of
[50:22] the people and made two CES of gold
[50:27] and then he said these are your Gods you
[50:30] worship them and he he one place in
[50:33] bethl and the other one he placed in Dan
[50:36] and you
[50:37] know because of that the word of God
[50:40] says it became sin to the people yeah
[50:43] and when he placed that Cal at at Dan
[50:47] Dan
[50:48] lost his heritance in the kingdom of God
[50:53] and you see in the Book of Revelation
[50:55] when you see
[50:57] in the tribe of Israel all those 12
[51:00] tribes were supposed to be there and out
[51:02] of those two 12 tribes 1 lakh 144,000 to
[51:06] be brought out in that list if you check
[51:09] it Dan's name is not there my dear
[51:12] friends D name is removed the whole
[51:16] tribe is removed and instead of that
[51:19] Ephraim is put back in there so we see
[51:23] that this thing became
[51:25] sin so if this is a shadow an image then
[51:30] this has to be in the reality and we see
[51:34] that in the year
[51:36] 3:25
[51:38] ad a counil was set right same word is
[51:42] used for that period my dear friends
[51:44] that's called the knce council yeah in
[51:47] the knes council they come up who were
[51:50] they all Idol
[51:52] worshippers who were they they were the
[51:54] people that come out from the Heathen
[51:57] worshippers and they came as a council
[52:01] and there they said together and they
[52:03] decided to have the doctrine of Trinity
[52:07] and that's how the doctrine of Trinity
[52:09] came in the church my dear friends they
[52:12] took one God out from the church right
[52:15] and they says you cannot understand the
[52:17] mystery of godhead so that we have
[52:19] brought you in a very simple way that
[52:22] God is a trinity that God is the uh God
[52:25] is the Father the Son and the Holy
[52:28] Spirit yeah and they gave that
[52:31] solution in you know in replacement see
[52:34] these cards were replacement and they
[52:36] gave them the
[52:38] replacement of the one God to Triune God
[52:42] then the second thing that they changed
[52:43] was the baptism they changed the baptism
[52:47] in the name of Father Son and the Holy
[52:49] Ghost right so that was another
[52:51] replacement and they put these two CS
[52:54] into the church yeah and the church
[52:56] started to worship it and the word of
[52:58] God says it became sin for his people my
[53:03] dear friends this took the things that
[53:06] they started to teach in the church to
[53:08] go against the
[53:09] Lord this God when these people decided
[53:14] to go and worship idols one time the
[53:19] Lord say now enough is enough now I
[53:22] cannot take anymore from my children
[53:24] Israel and it says I going to destroy my
[53:27] people and he says I'm going to take
[53:29] bring this people into captivity and
[53:32] send them to Babylon yeah and I'm going
[53:34] to destroy this Temple I'm going to
[53:37] destroy Jerusalem and it will be burned
[53:40] and then we say my dear friends that the
[53:42] King Nebuchadnezzar came up and he
[53:44] destroyed the temple he destroyed the
[53:46] Jerusalem and he took the people
[53:49] captives he took the king's captive unto
[53:52] Babylon for 70 years period right now
[53:57] we see if this is the shadow then there
[54:00] has to be a reality and that reality
[54:03] came in the Christian church age the
[54:05] darkest Church age and the brother says
[54:08] that the Catholic period that age was
[54:11] the most darkest period of the church
[54:13] history everything was just binded and
[54:17] they were in the prison right the the
[54:19] Bible itself was in a prison nobody was
[54:21] allowed to read the Bible nobody was
[54:24] allowed to take and read and interpret
[54:26] the Bible because the Bible was in the
[54:28] hands of the Catholics and all those
[54:30] popes and the people there so the
[54:32] general common people didn't have access
[54:35] to the scripture right they were all
[54:37] bounded people they were taken into
[54:40] captivity whatever the Pope says
[54:42] whatever the Catholic Church says they
[54:44] had to obey it they had to believe it
[54:46] they had to accept it and they thought
[54:49] that was their salvation but that was
[54:51] that that they were under a false things
[54:54] and then with see that the God made the
[54:59] judgment to come upon the Christian
[55:01] world and there was everywhere we see
[55:04] there was big persecution there was the
[55:06] killing the Christian people were killed
[55:09] Christian people were martyred and
[55:11] that's how we see the all the European
[55:13] people come to the United States and
[55:15] there they establish that United State
[55:18] my dear friends see how these things are
[55:20] happening in the in the land of Israel
[55:22] as a shadow and as we see in the reality
[55:25] in the Christian Church History this
[55:28] matches together but my dear friends we
[55:32] want to see that how the Lord brought
[55:36] his people back unto him Lord had given
[55:39] them 70 years now according to the Lord
[55:42] and the time the time of the coming of
[55:45] the Messiah was coming to
[55:47] closing
[55:49] and the
[55:51] time that Messiah was to appear because
[55:54] the scripture says in Ephesians when the
[55:56] fullness of the time come then Jesus was
[55:59] born of a woman so the time of the
[56:02] fullness was coming closer so when the
[56:04] time of the fullness was coming closer
[56:07] but here we see that there was no Temple
[56:10] because there has to be a temple before
[56:13] the coming of the Messiah amen because
[56:16] the scriptures were to be fulfilled
[56:18] because he was to come to the temple on
[56:21] riding on on on us on a moon you know he
[56:25] was supposed to come and the people will
[56:27] worship and say hosana hosana blessed is
[56:31] is is the the Messiah is the Lord who
[56:34] cometh in the name of the Lord God
[56:36] Almighty there that that song was to be
[56:38] sung that his coming was to be there
[56:41] then we see there was a holy of holies
[56:44] and there was a place of holy and there
[56:46] was a veil in between and that veil was
[56:50] to be T taken into two parts to be torn
[56:53] into two parts from top to the bottom so
[56:55] that the holy of holies be open to the
[56:57] people all the prophecies were to be
[57:01] fulfilled before for the coming of the
[57:03] Lord in in the temple and there was no
[57:06] Temple there was the people were all you
[57:10] know gone astray the people's minds and
[57:13] the hearts were not ready to receive the
[57:16] Messiah then how could come the Messiah
[57:19] so the Lord has to bring the things back
[57:21] to its place and there we see the Lord
[57:25] sent the prophet
[57:26] Ezra and nemiah turn with me to the book
[57:30] of
[57:31] Ezra and the third
[57:35] chapter
[57:41] and and the third verse and then the
[57:43] Lord sent Ezra back to Israel back to
[57:46] Jerusalem and when he come and it says
[57:49] it reads in the third verse and they set
[57:52] the altar upon his basis for the Fe was
[57:56] upon them because of the people of those
[57:58] countries and they offered burnt
[58:00] offerings there on unto the Lord even
[58:03] burnt offerings morning and evening
[58:05] right so when the Prophet come back and
[58:08] the children of Israel come back to land
[58:10] of Jerusalem they went to the Temple
[58:13] Mount they went to the temple side and
[58:16] there they looked for the place of the
[58:19] Altar and they placed the altar they
[58:23] raised the altar on its own place
[58:28] they could not place that altar in any
[58:30] other place and even now we see that
[58:33] another that the new Temple is to be
[58:35] built so they will not build the altar
[58:38] at any other place than its original
[58:40] place my dear friends because the Lord
[58:42] had commanded them that they will s
[58:45] offer the sacrifice on the place which
[58:47] the Lord has shown to them so they place
[58:50] that buil the altar to start the
[58:53] sacrifice unto the Lord and then the
[58:56] scripture says in the 11th and the 12th
[58:59] verse of the same
[59:00] chapter and they sang
[59:03] together co uh by cour in praising and
[59:07] giving thanks unto the Lord because he
[59:09] is good for his mercy endureth for ever
[59:13] toward Israel and all the people they
[59:17] shouted unto the Lord and in the 12th
[59:19] verse he says but many of the priests
[59:22] said and Levites and the chief of the
[59:24] fathers who were ancient men that had
[59:26] seen the first house when the foundation
[59:29] of this house was laid Before Their Eyes
[59:31] wept with a loud voice and many shouted
[59:34] with joy so here we see my dear friends
[59:37] the Lord brought them back to lay the
[59:40] foundation of the temple not in a
[59:43] different place but on the same place
[59:46] where they were supposed to offer their
[59:49] uh raise that Temple and that then buil
[59:51] the holy of holies and the holy place
[59:54] and the yard for the people so the Lord
[59:57] brought them together and they raised
[1:00:00] the Altar and they built the temple and
[1:00:03] then we see in the book of nem and the
[1:00:07] eth
[1:00:11] chapter book of nemah 8th chapter and
[1:00:15] the fourth and the fifth
[1:00:19] verse and it
[1:00:21] says and Ezra the scrib stood upon a
[1:00:24] Pulpit of wood which they had made for
[1:00:27] the purpose in the whole history of
[1:00:29] Bible we see the first time this Pulpit
[1:00:34] was built for nah and since then this
[1:00:38] Pulpit has been used to preach the word
[1:00:40] of God so Ezra was stood upon the pulpit
[1:00:44] of the wood which they had made for the
[1:00:46] purpose and beside him stood MAA and sha
[1:00:50] and all those people and then in the
[1:00:52] fifth verse it says and Ezra opened the
[1:00:55] book in the sight of the all people he
[1:00:57] for he was above all the people and when
[1:01:00] he opened it all the people stood up
[1:01:04] they honored the opening of The Book of
[1:01:07] the law and then we see in h in the same
[1:01:11] chapter 8th verse
[1:01:16] and and he says
[1:01:24] uh eth verse now so they read in the
[1:01:29] book in the law of God distinctly and
[1:01:32] gave the Saints and caused them to
[1:01:34] understand the reading right then nah he
[1:01:37] stood up and start to preach and then
[1:01:40] the word of God says that he read the
[1:01:42] book
[1:01:43] distinctly and gave the Saints and
[1:01:47] caused them to
[1:01:49] understand the reading and this is the
[1:01:53] way that the people were taught from the
[1:01:57] book of the law and in the word script
[1:02:00] the verse 13th and the last portion it
[1:02:03] says and the people and on the second
[1:02:07] day where gathered together chief of the
[1:02:09] fathers the PE all the people and as the
[1:02:12] Scribe even to understand the words of
[1:02:14] the law so these were people that the
[1:02:19] Lord make them to understand the law
[1:02:22] amen so now these things were to happen
[1:02:26] and now the altar was built the uh altar
[1:02:31] was raised the temple was built the law
[1:02:34] the book of the law was read unto the
[1:02:36] people and was made the people to
[1:02:39] understand the word and now when they
[1:02:42] receive the understanding of the word
[1:02:45] then comes the revelation of the word
[1:02:48] then comes the obeying the word and they
[1:02:51] obeyed the word in the same book of
[1:02:53] nemah 13th chapter and
[1:02:56] third
[1:03:01] verse and it
[1:03:04] says now it come to pass when they had
[1:03:07] heard the law that they separated from
[1:03:10] Israel all the mixed multitude oh yeah
[1:03:14] they separated from Israel all the mixed
[1:03:18] multitude when they did separated when
[1:03:21] isra opened the book of the
[1:03:23] law read distinctly
[1:03:26] gave them the right SS made them to
[1:03:29] understand and then they obey the word
[1:03:31] and the first thing they did that they
[1:03:33] separated this mixed multitude which was
[1:03:36] this mixed multitude this mixed
[1:03:38] multitude came along with the children
[1:03:41] of Israel when they left the land of
[1:03:43] pharaoh the land of bondage from that
[1:03:46] time almost more than a thousand year
[1:03:49] this mixed multitude was among the
[1:03:52] children of Israel and they were the
[1:03:54] troublemakers they are the people who
[1:03:57] took the children of Israel away from
[1:03:59] their lord and now they came and they
[1:04:04] removed all this mixed multitude and if
[1:04:08] you read in the further scripture then
[1:04:11] they removed the strange wives among
[1:04:14] them they removed the strange people
[1:04:17] from among them they separated them
[1:04:20] themselves now my dear friends they were
[1:04:22] ready to meet their Messiah right
[1:04:26] altar was raised Temple was built and
[1:04:29] the people's heart were ready to receive
[1:04:31] the Messiah because they believ they
[1:04:33] understood they read and understood the
[1:04:36] scriptures and now their eyes and
[1:04:38] understanding were open to receive the
[1:04:40] Messiah their hearts were ready they
[1:04:43] were ready to remove the mixed multitude
[1:04:46] they they were ready to even to forsake
[1:04:48] their wives which were the strange wives
[1:04:50] in scripture says and now they were
[1:04:53] ready to receive the Messiah
[1:04:56] but we see that the before the receiving
[1:04:59] of the Messiah there again something was
[1:05:03] to be
[1:05:04] happened and that was the messenger was
[1:05:07] to come in the Book of Malachi in the
[1:05:10] third chapter it
[1:05:12] says in the first verse book of Malaki
[1:05:17] third chapter and the first
[1:05:24] verse
[1:05:30] and he says behold I will send my
[1:05:33] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[1:05:36] before me and the Lord whom you seek
[1:05:39] shall suddenly come to his Temple even
[1:05:42] the messenger of the Covenant whom you
[1:05:45] Delight in behold he shall come said the
[1:05:48] Lord of host right so now we see my dear
[1:05:51] friends that this this was a shadow
[1:05:54] these were the the images the church was
[1:05:57] destroyed the temple was destroyed the
[1:06:00] people were taken into captivity there
[1:06:03] was no lawgiver there was no people to
[1:06:06] read or understand the scriptures
[1:06:08] everywhere was
[1:06:10] Darkness everywhere was Darkness the
[1:06:13] mixed multitude was right among the
[1:06:15] children of Israel and this situation
[1:06:18] was there and the Lord has to put give
[1:06:22] them the punishment the word of God says
[1:06:25] in the book of Jeremiah that lord gave
[1:06:27] them the such type of punishment that we
[1:06:29] cannot even think of my dear friends the
[1:06:32] Lord said that he shall eat the Flesh of
[1:06:35] your children when the enemies will come
[1:06:38] and and put their camps against
[1:06:41] Jerusalem and you go into the book of L
[1:06:44] Lamentations in the fourth chapter and
[1:06:46] the he lamented and he says that
[1:06:49] my young womans he say young woman he
[1:06:53] says he said they have eaten the Flesh
[1:06:56] of their bones their children the
[1:06:59] history says my dear friends that the
[1:07:02] Israelites had to eat the Flesh of their
[1:07:05] own children when the enemy came against
[1:07:07] them and had put the SI against them so
[1:07:10] that was the punishment that the Lord
[1:07:12] brought forth against his own people
[1:07:14] against his own children my dear friends
[1:07:17] now if that was the shadow that was the
[1:07:20] image now here if we come my dear
[1:07:23] friends now the time has come for our
[1:07:26] period now that we are dwelling in now
[1:07:29] we see there was no church as such to be
[1:07:33] called The Church of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:35] the original Church his body of Christ
[1:07:38] everywhere was Darkness everywhere was
[1:07:41] mixed multitude everywhere the teachings
[1:07:44] were all different kind of things they
[1:07:46] had already put the two CS to worship
[1:07:49] and the still the church in the today we
[1:07:52] see that worship the same CS of gold
[1:07:55] even that that doctrine of Trinity and
[1:07:58] the doctrine of the baptism in the name
[1:07:59] of Father Son and the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:01] still going on in the churches what they
[1:08:04] are doing they are worshiping the idols
[1:08:07] they are worshiping those two Idols that
[1:08:09] was taken place in the Council of n so
[1:08:12] that was the reality but now we see that
[1:08:15] we are at a place the church is nowhere
[1:08:20] it's just Lord has lord said I'll SP you
[1:08:23] out of my mouth right so Lord has
[1:08:26] already done that and brother Bram says
[1:08:28] that that the church has been already
[1:08:30] condemned and he preached that I I
[1:08:34] indict this generation for the second
[1:08:35] crucification of Jesus Christ he already
[1:08:38] has passed the Judgment upon the church
[1:08:40] people the church the cath anything now
[1:08:43] all the denomination these two sisters
[1:08:47] that Catholics and Protestants as
[1:08:49] brother as in Book of Jeremiah he says
[1:08:52] Israel you you went Hing and behind you
[1:08:56] your sister Judah also went hering so
[1:08:59] what was that the Catholics they were
[1:09:02] already called in the book of Book of
[1:09:04] Revelation as a herot yeah and now her
[1:09:07] daughters her sisters Protestant they
[1:09:09] come back and join with the WCC World
[1:09:12] Council of churches they joined with
[1:09:14] them in that fornication they are
[1:09:16] totally standing against God at this
[1:09:19] place my dear friends amen but we see
[1:09:22] now the scripture has to be fulfilled
[1:09:26] the word has to come true the plan of
[1:09:29] God has to be fulfilled right but there
[1:09:31] was no church such as the Church the
[1:09:34] true church of the Lord Jesus Christ all
[1:09:38] were mixed teachings all were mixed
[1:09:41] multitudes strange wives joined into
[1:09:44] some other denomination and that
[1:09:46] denomination doing hell lot everything
[1:09:49] was bad
[1:09:50] situation but now the time was coming
[1:09:53] that is coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:56] and here we see in the book of Mali the
[1:09:58] Lord says that I will send the
[1:10:02] messenger and he will go and prepare the
[1:10:05] way before me and that was
[1:10:08] true in the life of John the Baptist the
[1:10:13] Lord sent the prophet the Lord sent the
[1:10:15] messenger and it says the Lord whom you
[1:10:19] shall suddenly come to his Temple oh
[1:10:21] yeah see Lord was to come to his temple
[1:10:24] in that day and there was no Temple so
[1:10:27] the Lord has to bring the prophets to
[1:10:29] build the temple and to build the altar
[1:10:32] so that this prophecy come to tr that
[1:10:35] the Lord will come to his Temple and the
[1:10:37] Lord came to his Temple he fulfilled the
[1:10:40] scripture sure right but this was a
[1:10:43] shadow now the reality is this my dear
[1:10:46] friends that the god that the Messiah
[1:10:49] the Lord has to come back to its Temple
[1:10:52] right and now this is not the temple
[1:10:54] which was build by hands and the Lord
[1:10:57] says that you you demolish you destroy
[1:11:00] this Temple and I will bu build this
[1:11:03] temple in 3 days and he was not talking
[1:11:05] about the Temple of the King Solomon or
[1:11:07] the King Herod he was talking about this
[1:11:09] Temple the body of Christ and the Lord
[1:11:12] says I will raise this body and the Lord
[1:11:14] has raised this body amen and now my
[1:11:16] dear friends in this last
[1:11:18] days as the scripture has to come to
[1:11:22] fulfill that the word of God says and it
[1:11:25] says
[1:11:27] that behold he shall come and we read in
[1:11:32] Book of Revelation the word of God says
[1:11:35] he shall come lord said I will come and
[1:11:40] the spirit and the bride said come Lord
[1:11:43] come so that scripture has to be
[1:11:45] fulfilled but here the situation of the
[1:11:48] church was not ready their hearts were
[1:11:51] not ready everything was mixed all the
[1:11:55] teachings of the word of God were mixed
[1:11:58] maist Baptist jeah seven Adventist
[1:12:01] Pentecostal all mixed multitude but
[1:12:05] there was not true bride to receive the
[1:12:07] Lord Jesus Christ exactly and so the
[1:12:10] Lord fulfilled this scripture again in a
[1:12:15] reality and Lord sent the prophet
[1:12:17] Messenger to this church age my dear
[1:12:19] friend and the Lord send that Ministry
[1:12:22] of Ezra and nemah to be fulfill for our
[1:12:26] age that was a shadow but this was the
[1:12:29] reality and the prophet came up he
[1:12:32] raised the he raised the altar the right
[1:12:35] altar where the people could come and
[1:12:38] offer their lives as a Living Sacrifice
[1:12:40] unto the Lord the people could come to
[1:12:43] Jesus and to receive that uh that
[1:12:47] blessing when they offered their
[1:12:49] themselves on this on this Altar and the
[1:12:51] Lord received those people and we see
[1:12:54] that our prayers and and our offerings
[1:12:56] went unto the Lord and we see the
[1:12:58] Salvation come back into the into the
[1:13:00] church history then we see my dear
[1:13:02] friends that the people being saved
[1:13:05] people being come in the presence of God
[1:13:07] altar is a place where the people and
[1:13:10] God could come together GL that's the
[1:13:12] place of meeting that's the place where
[1:13:16] the the Lord and God could come and we
[1:13:19] can come and meet him in the
[1:13:21] Altar and that's how the prophet built
[1:13:24] that altar glory and then we see that he
[1:13:27] laid the
[1:13:28] foundation not any other Foundation but
[1:13:32] he laid the foundation back on the
[1:13:34] foundation of Paul and Peter sure that
[1:13:38] same Foundation which was laid by the
[1:13:40] apostles there was no other teaching
[1:13:43] there was no other other Foundation
[1:13:46] everything what brother Bram preached
[1:13:48] brother Bram preached out of this Bible
[1:13:50] he preached what Paul has preached he
[1:13:52] read that Bible he read that quote the
[1:13:55] was and he opened and expanded it what
[1:13:57] was his ministry is the same Ministry
[1:14:00] was like the the uh the is Ministry what
[1:14:05] was that Ministry he come to the pulpit
[1:14:08] he opened the book of the law he read
[1:14:12] distinctly made it Saints to that word
[1:14:16] and gave it to the people in a such a
[1:14:18] way that the people could understand it
[1:14:22] he broke into pieces he broke the word
[1:14:24] unto people in a very simplic City he
[1:14:27] read
[1:14:28] distinctly he does not read missing he
[1:14:32] he does not read just here or there
[1:14:34] something like that but he said it read
[1:14:36] distinctly made it a sense to the people
[1:14:39] and not only that but he made the people
[1:14:42] to understand now we understand that
[1:14:46] what's the seven the seven Church ages
[1:14:48] now we understand what the seven seal
[1:14:50] now we understand what the marriage of
[1:14:52] du now we understand what was the
[1:14:55] original seed now we understand all the
[1:14:58] mysteries of the go of the godhead so
[1:15:01] that's been explained what was that that
[1:15:03] is the
[1:15:04] reality that was the shadow at the time
[1:15:07] of as and N but the reality is the true
[1:15:10] church true bride of Christ reality is
[1:15:12] bringing back back the foundation of the
[1:15:15] word of God to the church my dear
[1:15:17] friends amen and then the mixed
[1:15:20] multitude were removed now there is no
[1:15:23] mixed multitude Among Us my dear
[1:15:26] friends there is no mix it's everything
[1:15:29] is pure seed of God it's pure seed of
[1:15:33] wheat amen is there lying on Under the
[1:15:38] Sun so no no mixing we don't mix with
[1:15:42] the
[1:15:42] world we don't dress as the world
[1:15:46] dress we don't speak as the world speak
[1:15:49] we don't curse as the C as the world
[1:15:51] curse we we don't have the doctrines as
[1:15:54] the the the denomination Doctrine says
[1:15:56] we don't believe in the TR God or two
[1:15:58] God but we believe in one God Amen we
[1:16:02] believe in the Jesus Christ come down in
[1:16:03] human flesh and being revealed to us we
[1:16:06] come back to the word now we have we
[1:16:09] have thrown away all the strange
[1:16:12] wives we have come out from
[1:16:13] denominations that's the strange wives
[1:16:16] there no more Pentecostal R more
[1:16:18] denominate Methodist or Baptist or
[1:16:20] anything now we come to God one onone
[1:16:23] relation with Jesus we are his bride now
[1:16:27] so this was the ministry of the prophet
[1:16:29] and that was the shadow but this is the
[1:16:32] reality so what he did he said he will
[1:16:36] prepare the way for the coming of the
[1:16:39] Lord so now John the Baptist ministry
[1:16:42] was there to prepare a way and then the
[1:16:45] scripture said and suddenly the Lord
[1:16:48] will come to his Temple if we are here
[1:16:51] my dear friends and if we see through
[1:16:54] the script scriptures the Fulfillment of
[1:16:56] the scripture the scriptures being
[1:16:59] reality unto us
[1:17:01] right I could give you more scriptures
[1:17:03] my dear friends on the children of
[1:17:07] Israel see they now they are coming in a
[1:17:11] reality because reality is in the New
[1:17:13] Testament they are coming to a place
[1:17:16] where they are going to have their
[1:17:18] reality my dear friends they are coming
[1:17:19] out of the Shadow they are coming out of
[1:17:22] that image no more their eyes will be
[1:17:25] mind they will have the open eyes to see
[1:17:27] the
[1:17:28] Messiah huh amen Zakaria 12th chapter
[1:17:31] will be will be revealed to them that
[1:17:33] will become a reality for them and they
[1:17:36] will say yes this is our God Jeremiah
[1:17:39] 25th chapter and they said this is our
[1:17:42] Lord that we had been waiting for him
[1:17:45] and they they said they will look upon
[1:17:47] Him whom they have appears these things
[1:17:51] has to come to reality in the days to
[1:17:53] come but as we as a church my dear
[1:17:55] friends where we are
[1:17:58] today we
[1:18:00] are at the
[1:18:02] time where the Lord will suddenly come
[1:18:05] to his Temple right and that Temple are
[1:18:08] we my de friends amen this is the time
[1:18:11] right all things are passed all that
[1:18:14] reality already closed that Messengers
[1:18:18] message uh The Messengers Ministry is
[1:18:21] already finished he's gone by to 45
[1:18:25] years has been passed now the only this
[1:18:29] scripture has to be fulfilled that
[1:18:31] suddenly the Lord shall come to its
[1:18:35] Temple that scripture has to become a
[1:18:37] reality now and we have approach to that
[1:18:40] place and I like to read uh 12th chapter
[1:18:45] of the Hebrews and the first
[1:18:53] verse
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:06] uh sorry it says
[1:19:13] uh
[1:19:16] bless first verse uh 12th chapter first
[1:19:19] verse wherefore seeing we also are
[1:19:21] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:19:25] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:19:29] and the sin which doeth so easily beset
[1:19:32] us let us run with patience the race
[1:19:36] that is set before us so Paul is saying
[1:19:39] that we are surrounded with the cloud of
[1:19:43] witnesses everything has just happened
[1:19:46] according to the the plan of God
[1:19:49] everything has happened exactly what the
[1:19:51] Lord has said in the past days and the
[1:19:54] that Lord has given us Old Testament as
[1:19:57] an image and as a negative and as a
[1:20:00] shadow that we could come to know that
[1:20:03] where we are standing in the in the word
[1:20:05] of God in the plan of God and the plan
[1:20:08] of God is very clearly is revealing unto
[1:20:11] us with all these witnesses as a pillar
[1:20:14] of cloud upon us that we are at the end
[1:20:17] of the times that all these things have
[1:20:20] fulfilled now the only thing the only
[1:20:24] word word for the bride of Christ is to
[1:20:26] be fulfilled is that he the Lord shall
