========================================

all right Isaiah 53 because to me you know we've been going through oh sorry today jun's birthday happy birthday to her need a big five and thank all of you for the came and all over the world have sister with us from we' known him for about eight years now six seven years and GE we still learned things that we've done almost the same so I think maybe we were in a past life brothers and sisters for real so but than one more thing Jun you didn't think nothing about them coming mama she thought I'd bought her a new car he put the blindfold on me I thought he was taking I mean when you well I mean I just thought that were coming you well not I mean I knew they were coming on my birthday but I didn't know that there was anything no she was getting sick nervous that she thought I had buy her one buy me one he's not buying me there's one thing for sure folks one thing for sure she's never going to trust anybody I you I repented of My Little White Lies last night the clock that I had last night to repent so I repented they didn't even tell me about it you know what we were weight well I was working out it just taking longer all right listen we're on internet they don't care about that are you I said I'm at Pine gr it happen so he had to come off but thank all of you for for helping yes thank you very much all right so we've been going through the breach and now what did we see out of the breach was the breach was a time time to where a lot of people think that a breach means a a gap which it does but a breach also means that you break through that's what when you breach security what do you do you broke through security so what we're doing in the Bible brother Rand had to preach the breach to show the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ for Redemption because that's exactly what all the seals are for is for Redemption but now what did we see in job see job said in my flesh I shall see God but in the end time we got to say the same thing but in my flesh I shall see God without death job couldn't say that he was one of the ones back in the Old Testament that couldn't be born again because Jesus hadn't died yet blood hadn't been shed but looking forward to a group of people like you and I he at least got a better Revelation than a lot of people he said in my flesh I shall see God right my flesh not another so it's a personal revelation of Jesus Christ in a new birth but it's got to continue past the new birth past the new birth that's what that statute of a perfect man is for you see that Holy Spirit up there that is the same Holy Ghost you receive but there's more word attached to it there's more life there's more not human knowledge but holy ghost knowledge knowledge of the word of God all right so that's what we saw in the breach and also we saw that um that brother randam was in the breach he was showing us there was a connection with the church ages and when we went through the other day and was showing that you know a lot of people in the message think that Redemption is over because brother R said in Revelations 5 that Jesus went and sat on the throne his redemp his mediatorial work was over well and we explained that I'm kind of go over it again before we start on the first deal but what happens is is you got to look at this thing as being finished that's what I dad and I were talking coming on the plane back from brother Jesse funeral brother brandham spoke I don't believe brother brandham you everybody gets into this Rema Loos and starts preaching all these different things brother Brandon was a human but yet he was a man sent from God to give us a message right brother Brandon would say you were always was eternal you wern't born on any certain day that was not the human William brandham telling us that that was God telling us because in God's mind it was already finished but then brother Brandon could turn around and say in another quote he said you start your eternal life right here at the altar right that was the human William brandom telling the human people you got to begin here at the altar but when God was speaking in the first person this is what I believe it's just me cuz you can't put the two quotes together how you going to take a quote where brother rown said you always was eternal you wasn't born again on any certain day then he said your eternal life started at the altar that's a contradiction in our human mind that's right but but the Revelation that I have that that D and I were talking about is that that God was speaking to us and saying you always and in God's mind we were always Eternal remember this Prophet went back into God's mind like no one else did actually he didn't go to God's mind God's mind came to him all right and gave him the Revelation that hey if you're born again that eternal life that you have never had a beginning that's right and it will never have an ending that's right and we are raised up sitting right sitting in Heavenly places MH right now MH that Soul you have and that's what's going to be hard because when we read Isaiah 53 there's your Daniel 70 weeks your sixfold purpose that is also six seals in Isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity iniquity the chastisement of our if we don't see that he did that you can't start for this guy right you can't start Redemption for this guy that you looking at now the one you're not looking at that was born again in 1998 he never said a bad word he never had iniquity right he never did anything wrong right the soul I'm talking about the soul they real inside me the new birth that came to me in 1998 and cleansed this guy out and made me a new creation well you know what my Redemption is over that's right my redemption's over that's right sir for the soul and we're going to see the body's got to go with it that's right if we believe this that's true in my flesh not a flesh somebody else gave me right and the flesh that Mom and Daddy gave me I'll see God cuz job didn't say in my in my new flesh right he's going to have to go through a change that's right but you and I going to have to say this and go through it without death that's why we're going to have to have a change here right all right the Holy Ghost is going to come give you the new birth and then you're going to grow in a statue of a perfect man all the way up to where it says love the Capstone all those virtues and God's going to seal you away because remember Jesus was on the River Jordan and God said through the prophet brother brandham he didn't read it like they did in the Bible he said this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed and from this part read it in future home and from this part of the earth what Jesus's Earth he said I'll redeem the rest of it right cuz what did he do he he there was a curse put on in the garden God didn't curse Adam and Eve he cursed the ground so here's the ground it's curse where were you and I you and I were in this table this ground right then your mom and daddy ate beans and potatoes and and procreated you you come out of what you come out of that cursed earth right but Jesus Christ didn't come out of this cursed earth right a body thou Hast prepared me he said sure it was a human body but it didn't come out of what Mary ate sure it nourished and brought that body out but that body was the body of almighty God but remember when it was born into this domain it started dying because Jesus was 30 and look 50 so his body wasn't Eternal but from that body from what we're going to read right now because his soul was given for a purpose but also his body was given for a purpose all right to get into this first seal we're going to have to see that that we are as Isaiah says here he was wounded for our transgression but remember Psalms said we were what born in sin right shapen in iniquity a spouse from our mother's womb a liar putting two verses together of scripture all right so now let's read Isaiah 53 and pay attention to what this is saying right cuz you got to see in Revelations 5 we saw and how many times did I go over and over we're number 12 on the breach and this is the breach SL first seal so we took 12 30 minute sections talking about the breach and what you know what it meant to us but as far as we're concerned Revelations 5 was the opening of the seal that's what the prophet said right cuz the next time you see the book is open right he takes the book sits on the throne he has he has acquired something he has taken that book in his possession sit down on the throne and then he begins in Revelation 6 to what open the seals and then we see in Revelations 10 that that little book was open all right so if I believe that then I have to believe that what Jesus Christ did in flesh and gave his solar Ransom like we're going to see here that my Redemption is over that's right so I can believe that in my flesh I shall see God but remember one thing we got to look at it the way God looked at it but humanly we got to go through the Journey that's right pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon brother Claude died myself we preach the pardon right we do like Abraham Lincoln every time we get up there we sign the pardon but unless you say that's for me right that's right that's right it does no good that's right okay so you still got to accept it you can't shout and praise God about being uh born again if you're not if you can't shout and praise God and say well my body's changed look at me no your body's not changed till I'm looking at it's old right mhm okay so let's have reality but let's look at what God saw God saw this thing over and done with so I'm standing in the body that I'm going to live in for eternity now but it's not all the way changed yet that's right you still see me as gray-headed and all that but inside of me is that 20-year- old guy what me and dad was talking about the other day we got to understand one thing that one inside of us had better be greater than the one on the outside that's right because right now brother Tom is 84 four he's old he's he's he's been over he's having a lot of health problem but inside that man is a 20y old Eternal being with God right and all it's going to take is for that Inside Man to break that shell of the outside man and the ins and the outside man is going to be what changed to a 20-y old person that's right so see we're not going to get in new body so really honestly let's be truthful if you're born again today your Redemption is over your Journey's finished that don't mean we don't have to keep coming to church that don't mean we don't have to keep praying I see that people go on the other side this side of the message that redemption's over we don't need anything so let's go live like we want to we've heard that before right there's this on this side say we don't have anything we got to wait for brother Brown to come back but why don't we just bring them all together and say okay this guy inside of me is done and finished he never did anything wrong right right never right back in eternity he's an eternal person with God that's right but we had to come down in a body of Flesh to prove that that's what it is that's what Jesus Christ did he came to prove that he could live in a human body God God always wanted to live in a human body told you that many times before that's God's plan do what come down on earth have children live in a human body and commune with us and live with us you said how do you know that well that's what we're going to right and God can't change his mind that's right right that's right we just drop down into permissive will to show Satan that we can do it and then we're going to go right back to where the Garden of Eden condition where God can come down in the cool of the day and talk to his children Adam and Eve which is going to be the Bride of Jesus Christ all right any questions on that before we get started brother Brian said as though you never done that's right but we got to realize that that thing inside of us you I don't like to call it a thing but the Bible did did that thing inside of you all right but that thing inside of you we got to realize that God gave us that if you're born again if you're not then we're not even talking to you that's I'm telling you about this seals the seals have got to be revealed to Born Again Christians that are a little bit in the maturity stage that's right okay somebody that really understands and that's what but still though even going through the seals the seals are given for Redemption of the body yet inside those seals is redemption of your soul you can get Born Again by listening to what we're talking about because there's nothing but nothing but one two three four a step remember s Johnny how we I haven't done your chart yet but I think we're going to do it again and put it on the internet since it was it's been watched by a lot of people but the first seal it shows justification this is what I want you to keep keep in your mind second seal sanctification third seal baptism of the Holy Ghost fourth is the word being born inside of you then you go right back to what justification sanctification and there is your highest form of the Holy Ghost right when that Seven Seals open to you that means Christ has come to you as a person right you Lisa Dale as a person this is baptism of the Holy Ghost in its highest form so you go through justification what are we talking about now getting rid of our iniquity pretty good start a get start white horse rider what does he do he starts cleaning you out red is always sanctification we're cleansed by the blood and and then then Paul said we're what I Die daily we're cleansed being born again all right baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the black horse rider or death death well that's when you die remember you don't die at justification sure there's Parts there things that go out sanctification unclean Spirit goes out but he don't die because he can come right back right that's right but if you're dead that's death all right then you got what you got all three of these makes the Pale Horse cuz what was the Pale Horse He was white red and black mixed together you mix those three colors and you get that okay you get to pay a horse and that is the word all these mixed together brings the word to you then you start again right back out in justification where you are like Mom said you didn't do it we got to realize that we did we did do it Satan's going to tell you in your brain you did do it for the day that we get changed right but remember if the devil ever talks to you he's a liar that's right he's a liar he may be telling the truth cuz you did do what you did that's right but in God's mind he's a liar that's right inside that man that man inside of you or woman Inside of You person inside of you did not do those things that's why in this age we are the only people that can understand this because in the other ages they've come to a certain level and it was like Paul said I see through a glass Darkly they come to a place and they're like well well you know all the denominations and most of the people in the message think you got to get a new body that God don't have enough his sanctifying blood didn't sanctify us enough but now when see Jesus dropped his blood at Calvary the prophet said it done what Sanctified the Earth that's right see he's coming back the Earth's got to come back in the same process that we do it follows us justification by Noah start with water baptism sanctification Jesus dropped his own blood and what does the blood do it sanctifies you so he cleansed and claimed this whole earth when he was hanging on Calvary that's why we're going to read out of that 53 that's why I love that scripture so much and where was your body your body was in that Earth now but we still had to come through permissive will though we had to come through mom and daddy that's right but he was sanctifying a group of people who his bride his bride hadn't been born yet remember his bride was inside of him that's why they pierced his side remember and the side was open brother Brown said we came out the bride the life came out right Isaiah 53 who ha believed thy report and to whom is the arm or what is the arm word of the Lord reveal where he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he ha no form no cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and he hid as it were our face from him we hid as our face from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrow yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted most people that didn't know what was going on thought that he was just a human mortal man which he was but that was God dying for us people that was not just a normal human being but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity cuz where do you transgress your body where you commit iniquity in your body the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed we don't get sick in our soul we get sick in our body yes sir so Jesus come to do two things John said Behold the Lamb of God which was our sacrifice that takes away the sin of the world he had to die in flesh cuz you put a human you put a not a human but you put a lamb up on a on a um fire to commit him as a sacrifice but he was the ultimate sacrifice he was a human lamb all right but then you see the second thing he done which we're going to read right here but the first thing he done he did all those things to clean us up on the outside man but watch this we all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed Afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living now who shall declare his generation Isaiah is asking a question this man if he is going to be the great almighty God and he's going to would be the one that's going to have children and he's the one that's going to live with eternally with all these uh children of his he's dying he's dead in the flesh he's dead who shall declare his what generation his genealogy in other words how is this man going to fulfill this scripture cuz in in the scriptures before it if he takes away your sin takes away your iniquity and he takes your healing gives you your healing Isaiah in his in his mind he was thinking how is this great man going to do it and he's dead or he's dying okay for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth Isaiah's thinking of a mortal man hanging on a cross there's no way he can procreate because he's dying he didn't have a wife there was no other way for him to get his genes or genealogy to go any further there was no other generation past Jesus Christ as far as what Isaiah could see of this flesh man hanging on the cross cuz I believe Isaiah had a vision okay that's the way brother R said prophets were they had Vision okay God would give them a vision they'd write it down but that's what John did and that's what Isaiah I believe the Old Testament did but Isaiah was looking at a mortal man right he was looking at this great man but he was looking at a mortal man that couldn't procreate that he was dying and his generation was going to be cut off but see he wasn't dying for the he sure he was dying in the flesh for the natural man but the real man he wanted out of was what was inside of him which was the eternal life right cuz I believe it was in in Jesus Christ from the time he was the baby all right cuz remember he was Emanuel God With Us he wasn't just a man walking around and all of a sudden he become God I don't believe that I know you you don't need him and he had made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruis him he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin now sins in the body we can be forgiven sins in the soul we can't be that's right you understand what I'm saying if you're a sinner and you're sinning you're a sinner that's right but if we sin as a Christian we don't sin in our soul if you're born again we sin in our body that's right our spirit Spirit realm we we have sins every day we have bad thoughts things like that but this man right here he made his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed now what does a seed do a seed is a procreation that's that's the generation isai now he's getting a revelation he's saying oh the soul of this man go back to Genesis 1:26 that was not natural procreation that was spiritual creation the spoken word is the Original Seed spoken word not from the loins of man anymore and this watch what Jesus did he come to show that that not out of the loins of man was was was anybody any good but now the soul see listen shall make his Soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pledge of the Lord shall prosper in his hand remember go to Revelation 3:14 Jesus Christ was the what beginning of the creation of God all right he shall see the travail of his soul remember he cried out for forgiveness of the for the people when he was crying out all right he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the small with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death now his soul can't die but his flesh had to die to release that Soul right so it was unto death it wasn't to death it was unto it was going toward it was going to death because you can't kill God right but when God stepped out of that human body guess what human body died simple as that but that was a sacrifice hanging on the cross that was the Lamb of God but the soul was the one that paid the ransom the soul is the one that went to hell to preach to the souls in prison the soul is the one that come back up to paradise and picked up all the people the soul is what came back to you in the New Birth on on the day of Pentecost 120 people were not birthed by their by fleshly Jesus that's right cuz it's not coming back to the Millennium but he sent his soul a ransom a ransom is something you pay that's right somebody steals something or or takes a child you go pay a ransom right to get him back Satan stole this Earth from God just for a little time and then he started on working on you and I that's right right so God is buying them back he's giving an offering and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made Obsession for their transgression now if you go back to the sixfold purpose of Daniel we have read the whole six-fold purpose right there in that in that scripture we've also read six seals iniquity sin all these things he give his soul what that's a new birth the soul of God is a new birth amen that's the new birth coming to you and I that was the very soul of God come in brother R said you and him vulcanized you and him in there as persons right a lot of little things brother brand said he said this is my eye God gave it to me what was he saying this is my eye my mom and daddy made it but when God give it to me it's mine right it's not somebody else's so when he gives me the new birth it's not God's anymore it's mine and you can't separate me in that new birth okay same way what he said all those little things that brother R said is it was for a purpose he did not just tell stories to fill up space on a tape didn't I mean he did not and and life stories that we have don't just fill up you know pages in a book or or you know a tape but the breach showed us how it was going to begin how that that God was going to come in human flesh cuz remember remember he didn't just come in human flesh to take away the sin of the world and everybody die he came to find a group of people that was going to believe enough to where they could destroy death while they were here amen I've told you many times before we've got to come back as the Bride of Jesus Christ we just don't come back as a resurrected Jesus Christ we've got to look to where when he said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me where were you and I we were inside of him right in the new birth in the eternal life that when that man raised he raised in a Immortal body changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye he was when he come out of that grave that same man went right back and picked that bruised body up and as soon as that eternal life went right back into that body and raised that body up guess what happened to the body sure he still had the nail scars and and the prince but that's for our sin he was our sin Bearer but he went he didn't come out of that tomb looking like a bruised old man CU Mary remember Mary Magdalene this is the key Mary magdaline did not know Jesus as 20 years old that's right she knew him as a 30 something year old man that had been through a couple of years of ministry so he looked kind of old cuz Mary turned around and thought remember the Bible said thought he was the young Gardener that's right right that's right so she heard the voice she heard the voice she heard that voice when that boy said Mary she said my Lord that's why they didn't believe who he was they remember Peter they he appeared to Peter and Peter went fishing the next day if a man raised from the dead that I'd seen die I he wouldn't be out of my sight but they didn't have a revelation they weren't born again Peter was not a born again Christian sure sure Jesus was standing there but he still had to go up and come back down in the spirit to give them a revelation and that's why the 121 went preaching all over the world cuz they saw what had happened and God quickened every bit of that to their heart but that's no different than you and I God giv you a new birth he's going to Quicken you and do the same thing that's right the difference in them and us is they went down remember the Bible say you've lost your first love but in the Sabbath Church age there's no losing of our first love because we are turned back to the first love and we don't go away from it anymore we don't go down we go up that's right all right so when we're going to start we're going to start here next Sunday the word iniquity I ask you to look it up yourself I found a few different ones some this is Verity depravity guilt punishment guilt of iniquity guilt or conscious of our punishment for iniquity or one of these here I have is is like I told you last Sunday is a hideous sin now brother randam definition was is something you know better to do and you do it anyway that's basically the same thing they're telling you here that's the Hideous sin is when you know you're doing it wrong right he said you either do something that you're not supposed to do that's iniquity or this is another one people don't like are you something you should have done and you didn't do that's right right let me quote you a scripture if you think your brother has an odd against you you must go to that brother that's right not wait for him to come to you right and if you know he's got an odd against you you're committing iniquity he's not you are he's got answer for God for what he's thinking about you right but as far as you knowing there's a problem you got to go to that person that's iniquity that's thing want see we're going to really dig into our life now cuz this is going to be life lesson number one first seal iniquity hideous sin you don't ever sin in your soul John the B John the John the Revelator was born again for 60 years how many times did I tell youall that 150 okay this is 151 John the Baptist was John the Revelator that's why I had to tell you that this many times CU they keep saying John the Baptist John the Revelator what do you get over John the Revelator was born again for 60 years remember he he got born again in 833 in ad90 he's on the aisle of patmas he's been a born again Christian for 60 years and he's crying for Redemption he wasn't crying for redemption in his soul he was crying because there was no man worthy to destroy death in this man right here that's the key people to that Revelations 5 John was weeping cuz it was was no man worthy to change this body that's just the way I believe it because John was born again Christian he didn't need eternal life in his soul he'd been born again for longer than most of us been alive living and saw the master himself and walked with him and laid on Jesus's bosom Jesus's closest friend little young man walking with Jesus Christ but he comes up to the Ale of patmas Revelations 5 and he sees no man Worthy and they was until they saw that lamp come around behind the Altar and then they kept then they they said worthy John saw that that man was worthy to take a body change cu no other man was worthy for that we'll start on iniquity read Isaiah 53 over again and then read Daniel 9 24 right
