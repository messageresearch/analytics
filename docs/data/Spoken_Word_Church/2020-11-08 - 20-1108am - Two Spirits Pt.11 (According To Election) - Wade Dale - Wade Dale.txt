to do it while you're standing up that way you can get to your billfold better that's what brother homer longor always said so while he's doing that we will make a few announcements again remember brother luis is in florida at jacksonville we kind of watched him a little bit last night he's a brother keith brown's interpreting so he's having a good time down there speaking for them today so just pray for them on be on the way back also he'll be speaking for us this wednesday all right so brother louise will be preaching this wednesday i will be gone i'm leaving tuesday night going to illinois to hunt for several days i'll be at brother richard hyatt's next sunday so i will not be here um brother aaron will be preaching next the week after we're going to get a calendar like we did last year so because of all the dates because the next tuesday now we know the 22nd i mean the 24th brother terrence has already announced that's but we're also going to do it the tuesday not this coming week but the next week and brother aaron will be preaching because dad and i are leaving gun season starts in illinois so we're leaving on wednesday afternoon heading up that way so we're going to change that to tuesday also so after this coming wednesday the next time you look on the calendar will be tuesday and then the next tuesday will be the 24th before thanksgiving we'll be having tuesday night service regular service brother aaron will be preaching for us on that will be the 17th of november like i said we're gonna get a calendar brother joe's gonna get it i'm gonna fill it out and then we'll have it where everybody will know what's going on because it's hunting season and we're usually gone and we're gonna be gone the weekend after thanksgiving so just pray for us we haven't been able to go anywhere this this year so we're going to take off for a little while i'm going to take him up and let him rest a little bit all right so and then because and sunday the 22nd we both will be in kentucky somewhere either brother byler's or brother richard hyatt so just pray for us with that uh brother bob just heard from him he's doing better they're they're coming out of it and they're doing okay so we need to pray for him and then remember after the service pastor appreciation day we're going to have cake and ice cream downstairs for everyone and if you brought any gifts you can give them to brother dale but we'll get our food down here and we've already got the table set up outside it's going to god give us a good warm day not cold so we thank god for that we asked to pray for brother brother uh ryan's family also with the loss of the dad and uh god knows everything he knows what he's doing and we don't question hey man i think many times we we do question and that's okay it's all right but uh even with um sister alicia's mom and the different ones that have passed on you know you this is the way i see it i i you may not see it this way but being a minister of the gospel i see that it's the providence of god to take if they're not going to be taken up in a rapture they'll be resurrected and taken up in a rapture but if they don't they don't have to go through the tribulation period god will preserve them and then right there to white throne judgment let's see what god can do for them amen don't let them go through this horrible thing you know and and we don't pray that god will take them but you know that's the providence of god the providence of god is is he's if he knows he's going to give him eternal life down at the end why let him go through the tribulation just go ahead and take them on now preserve them i've always said preserve he preserved them he takes them and preserves them until the time appointed and to me that's the providence of god and i thank god for that we don't like the separation but we do say thank you lord that that they won't have to go through this awfulness that the world's fixing to have to go through so we just that's just the way i think and and i think god is uh he's a good god he's not a mean god he's a good god he knows what he's doing i was just reading brother brown said he god knows what he's doing so we just need to depend on that god knows what he's doing he knew before the foundation of the world and today we're gonna it's kind of strange uh well it's really not but we're on two spirits and then uh back right after wednesday night i thought well lord what are we going to what are we going to speak on and and i read the scripture on in romans where god talks about according to election well we just had an election so we're going to speak on according to election but it's not going to be of that election that went on out there it's going to be an election that comes on in here in a christian life amen so let's let's read first john 4 verse 1. we're still on two spirits we still want to see that how god is a good god like i said before he's gracious he showed us in the end time where we were at and before the foundation of the world what we're going to do here everything he's given us already and where we're going thank god for that good to have our brother with us today i don't know if he's ever been here before you never been here before well god bless you good to have you in the house with lord you got some pretty good company over there with sister um kathy and brother ray but good to have you with us brother and you just make yourself at home and you're part of the family of god so we don't have to you don't have to join nothing just come on man just be part of the family the next time you come you won't be introduced because you'll just be part of the family first john 4 verse 1 let's bow our heads lord thank you today that we can stand in this end time of chaos and and everything falling apart and lord we just had a a pop-up there on my phone from the weather channel that a 4.0 earthquake just hit massachusetts in rhode island lord that's on the other side that's over here toward us and the bible said there would be earthquakes and divers or many places lord we're expecting lord you to as brother joe and i were speaking this morning anything that happens in this world it happens because the bride has come to serm some sort of place good or bad amen bad and that we need to be scolded are good and that we've come into the word more we're seeing more the revelation is coming more deep it's becoming more intimate with us lord and then we're just going to slide right out of here and let the world have it father give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our sins be with the ones that are sick thank you for bringing all the ones through it lord and i pray lord the ones that are going through they're so virus and all the different things anything lord is going in the body lord we pray that you would eliminate that lord because you are the healer father we give you all the praise and honor and glory and we give you the service in jesus name amen first john 4 verse 1 says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ come in flesh is of god now like i said before you can ask a drunk on the street if jesus christ came in flesh and he says yes that doesn't make him a son of god he's got to believe and keep on believing and he's got to show the attribute of that believing by doing what the word said and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist antichrist that's what we're talking about today two spirits this been this is part 11 we've been on the two spirits from the foundation of the world when lucifer fought with michael those two lines started and they came to earth and they went all the way through as we were talking wednesday night and rode right on through there in the garden of eden in a situation of cain and abel there and i want you to understand i didn't bring out winning tonight but before i forget it you read the commentary about the denominational world and they talk about the four horse riders and they say that's four different people it's not thank god for a prophet that told us that he got off that horse got on the black horse got off that red horse got off that horse got on the uh black horse got off that horse and now he's riding in the pale horse so it's the same brother brown said satan's superman all right so we know it so then there's that two spirits you got the spirit of god and spirit of the devil right and that's what that horse rider was there's there's combat beasts that are of god there's those four horse riders are therion beasts that are that are not good and every spirit that confesses not that jesus is coming flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world this is a.d 60 or 70 something or 90 80 90. you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater jesus in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you may be seated and the lord adds blessing to the reading of the word let's go through these quotes try not to be very lengthy today but just kind of give you an overview of what we were talking about wednesday night for those of you that weren't here but let's read the first quote that we've been that we've been reading every time now remember this christ in the true church now listen there's a true church in the false church all right always has been always will be a church we're not talking about drunks and hordes and all that we're talking about two spirits in a church okay in the framework of the church all right we're not talking about baptist methodist pentecostal whatever background you come from remember we're not talking about people it's spirits that we're worried with it's spirits that anoints each and every one of us it's spirits that motivate us to do what we do but now remember when we get to the end of this you're going to see this according to election though is you got to one day make a stand and say yes or no no dilly dallying around there's a day that you got to come to and say this is it all right christ in the two church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless you look in the book of revelations and you see that it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting now remember i said before satan in the beast in the garden of eden did not say there was not a god he did not say what god said was wrong he just added that one word he said you'll not surely die so he discredited the word of god he didn't do away with it satan satan's too smart to do away with the word of god because when the two spirits start battling it was lucifer and and michael and it was the two heads it was the two top guys that were fighting all right so don't you think that they're not very deceptive because they fought and then satan comes down here and god comes down and then he anoints us and we'll get into that election part in just a little bit right down to the time that he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church all right and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army i like invincible if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church in the book of luke and there it says they come to me in in the at the judgment bar in other words they said have i not cast out devils have i not spoken have i not judas is going to do that judas did the same he preached the gospel he cast out devils that's how close it is it's not that it's not that the drunk's going to walk up and say have i not get no it's the religious person that's going to come up and say have i not done these mighty things in your name and jesus is going to say depart from me i never knew you in other words i never had an intimate relationship you never said yes when i came to you to give you the baptism of the holy ghost you turned it down wow because they're going to be surprised remember the old saying that we're going to be really surprised who makes it and who don't right because you know what it's god looking at it not us looking at a laundry list of what we need to do do's and don'ts and all these things it's the heart that god looks at if you get a true revelation of the true spirit within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the anachronic spirit so you got to have god's spirit first to discern the other spirit all right if not listen if you don't have the spirit of god in your soul today you are that other spirit whether you like it or not amen you're sitting there with satan will be powerless before her you're sitting there and the bible calls it the seed of satan now we know the seed of satan is going to be out there in the beast when we leave here but the seed of satan is the soul of man if you're not born again that's what he wants uh sure he wants to build a kingdom but how is he building that kingdom through men that's right satan's building the kingdom through men all right what's god doing god's building the kingdom through men and man you see how close it's going to be all right so number two this is still in the exposition of the church ages did you get it now these are those twins again now we're going to talk about them today again and go through the bible just for a minute because remember the bible says according to election god cannot choose one over the other and be just he cannot say i'm just going to choose robert doherty and no one else nope we proved it last wednesday kane has the same opportunity you did same opportunity god said if you do well everybody's going oh cain's just the other devil and he's this no he had an opportunity by election to choose what god said and what do you do he voted some other way so that's where you get election from just like esau and jacob but you got to get into predestination with that which we will for just a minute i know we all know predestination here in this church has been preached correctly and the right way so we we should know that by foreknowledge god predestinates not that he'll put you in a tube and pull you through and say this is exactly the way you're going to be no god knew that's the way you'd be there are two trees again growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain what is rain washing of the water of the word you can sit here today be just as lost as lost can be and still rejoice anybody can raise their hands anybody can think thank god for what they've done we hear presidents and vice presidents and we hear these people and and you know last night the other one made his speech and he brought god into it and they ain't a god none of them zero they're all of the devil amen i didn't get many amens on that amen they're both of the devil it's all of the devil if they're not born again they're lost and they're being influenced by that other spirit listen the spirit of god is not in the white house but see that you can quote god and everybody thinks oh he's a christian but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of god exactly as god give it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of god and changes it now it doesn't do away with it he changes it remember what i said that what they did in isaiah they didn't do away with the word of god at the 300 council at nicaea or at the 600 council of nicea they didn't throw the bible out but they brought in an idea from the other guy they were anointed by the other spirit to bring this false baptism of fatherless unholy ghost nowhere in the bible come from the pits of hell amen so there's your anti-word but you know what though they instituted it into the religions of the world and they live by it and god winked at their ignorance for a time but now's not the time we've been told right amen i don't want to be baptized in the name of father's own holy ghost that's titles thank god a prophet came by and said look even demons travel in the name of father son holy ghost oh my that hurts sometimes when you've been raised a different way but when you come into the family of god what is the name of the family of god jesus christ that's why peter on the day of pentecost said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen so they changed the word of god didn't do away with it satan smarter than that he knows not to do away with it he knows to just change it and twist it just a little bit all that's got to be in eternal hell because now how in the world can you have an eternal hell there's only one eternal life and that puts god in hell no hell is not eternal there's an eternal judgment that's where election comes from there's an eternal judgment but there's not an eternal hell change it where it wants to it substitutes its own creeds now he's talking about the creeds of the denominational world and even the creeds in this church if we have one anti-word it substitutes its own creation dogma for the living true word exactly as did cain who ended up killing abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan and remember we we read the scripture there in matthew we'll read it in a minute where jesus said if that light and you be darkness how great is your darkness so we looked at the law of reproduction we're just kind of skimmed through this the law of reproduction just for the for the new ones or somebody didn't listen to wednesday night the law we produce reproduction is what every seed will bring forth of its kind whatever seed is planted that's what it's going to bring i did not expect to plant tomato seed and get carrots no that seed will bring forth of the life that's in itself same way with you and i same way with satan he looked at what god said in the beginning because satan was there yes satan was right there in the beginning and god said let every seed bring forth of its kind satan said okay i can work with that because i'm going to cause this to happen with this and we're going to have god's going to have to give it life that's how satan injected himself into the human race through the beast and having an affair with eve and planting a natural seed but he had to plant a seed up here first a seed of doubt before the other seed could take a hold because look eve was deceived and not adam what is the word deceived means to cause to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid that's deception deception today is is believing you're right and you're wrong but that's what the devil wants you to do amen because matthew 6 22 says the light of the body is the eye if therefore thy eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light that's wonderful but if thine i be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness because you are deceived into thinking that the light that you have is light but it's not that's why god had to send us a prophet in the end time to turn us back not to a different bible not to another god but back to the one true and living god back to the beginning where there was not a denomination there was not a an idea sure there was the antichrist spirit was there in paul's time grievous wolves he talks about john here in first john says there would be the spirit of antichrist would creep into the church but now we see that was in baby form and now we see it in what we see it in full grown form amen because this is the end time this is the last church age that we're dealing with and brother branham said this whole this whole place is was all dark and he said i added a little bit of light when uh when the angel drew the church ages across the across the wall in the back of the tabernacle he said i added a little bit of light why because that's me and you amen isn't that wonderful though that we had a prophet to do that he was pronouncing judgment on the world but he was pronouncing that me and you had a chance amen you and i have a chance to get out of here all right other than that we don't there's no denomination going to take us in a rapture what does it take to make a christian life number three we'll get right down here in just a second and start on the election what does it take to make a christian life now women must bring forth his germ of life her and man together by connection we won't go into that because you certainly disagree with me he's talking about what happened in the garden of eden it was not apples in the garden of eden we know that for a fact if you're a grown individual today if you don't know what's going on and what's your problem and my problem is then you got a problem you're deceived because i ate a couple of apples yesterday on my route and i'm fine i mean really that's silly you look the world goes no it was an apricot no it was creeds creeds they're dying by creeds she didn't eat an apple or a pomegranate she per took of what satan gave her and had a sexual affair with him with satan in the form of the beast and had a child cocaine the woman was actually the woman was actually deceived adam was not deceived he knowed what he was doing eve actually thought she was right she was getting some new light now that's what happened when we talked about nazi aroma when i see rome had their council they thought we don't want any more of that 300 year stuff that jesus taught and the disciples taught and most of them was already dead because it was 300 years after but they had there was the pr there was prophets and true people irenaeus martin you had all those that came up in that time that were true prophets of god that had the true word of god right but at nicaea satan walked in and says we're going to change things and that's what happened but see she the church thought she was getting some new light when the true light was already there and irenaeus and martin and the different ones the church age messengers of the day but look what the bible says he still or brother brown said he's still giving her new light stay with the bible that's it number four oneness see she was all ready to be mother and that never only what it did was clear up the thing of the serpent seed the seed that's in you now is by conception your unlawful act against my word because remember it wasn't supposed to be by sex it was supposed to be by spoken word of god amen the seed that's in you why you know why we know that go the book of luke go to book of matthew immaculate conception which is spoken word watch this the seed is in you now by conception your unawful act against my word with this thing here talking about the beast and you are now got the serpent seed but i'll give you a seed by immaculate conception and his seed shall bruise the serpent's head and his head shall bruise your heel the heel amen just let god have it if it's his word he'll bring it to pass just let him have it so now we come to genesis 4 1 and we're just going to shoot through it real quick and start here with with election i just left it blank because we're going to uh read just a minute in chapter four we know that the prophet of god that the lord sent us in the end time that the book according to the bible in revelations 5 that book that was handed to the one on the throne was closed and and then there came a cry thou art worthy to open the book because in revelations 10 1 through 7 you see a mighty angel coming down from heaven now something happened from revelation 5 to revelations 10 now this mighty angel comes down and the book is open amen and then john being top of the bride he says give me that book which that book was open so you and i are living now under an open book we're not living under a creed or a denominational book or any kind of eyes of that i was thinking yesterday sometimes that gets me in trouble but yesterday i was thinking i thought lord i was reading paul where paul would stand up and paul and even stephen man if you read that sermon stephen preaches to him and makes them so mad they stone him and kill him but he took them all the way from the foundation of the world he took them from abraham amen told them exactly what the torah said exactly what moses did exactly how many years they had been kept he preached them a perfect word right down to jesus he's but see that's the problem that's when he got personal that's when i believe he pointed to him sanhedrin he said that jesus whom you crucified but see that was a true message there was no faults in it at all listen don't worry folks if you got the word of god and it's a true word of god that's what i say about you say well y'all think y'all true and somebody's got to be true there's got to be a holy ghost that got into stephen the bible said full of the holy ghost and he preached that sermon all the way they killed him for it then you got paul paul gets up to agrippa he starts over there at the road to damascus and agrippa remember i think he's part jew right remember he's kind of got a little dealings with the jew so he's listening to what paul said he knows paul at one time hated the christians and now he's preaching him a sermon walks him right down through his life and he comes to jesus christ and he does the same thing and you know what what did agrippa say he said oh paul he said man that's the best sermon i've heard in a long time he said you almost make me want to be converted but that's a true you got to know whether it's true or not you got to know whether what you're listening to is true that's right that's just my thought i'm telling you there's there's there's if stephen can keep it in line by the holy ghost paul can keep it in line by the holy ghost listen paul was so anointed to we quote him as being what god said eighty percent of the new testament was written by the apostle paul and god thought so much of it it was so perfect because remember what this word is perfect so what he done and what he wrote and what luke wrote and what peter wrote what john wrote was perfect because they were led by the holy ghost if we're led by the holy ghost and that's exactly the same result you and i are going to get amen so genesis 4 we see that now we look under this open book and we see that the seals are open we can see that god in verse 5 it says cain his offering was not respected in other words god said cain why are you wroth and why is your countenance falling if thou do us well i knew they'd probably pick it up if thou do us well come on out right down here genesis 4 7. if thou doest well there's grace god extended grace and said cain wade put your name in there if you do well yes you can receive eternal life not talking to me now not him talking to me you can receive eternal life if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted accepted by who god not by the world that's right not by your neighbor but by god direct he's talking straight to god amen if thou doest not well here's the election send lives at the door look and in other words watch it it's going to consume you cain unto thee shall be his desire what who sin and thou shalt rule over him in other words sin will take you over but now watch cain rejected that we know that because he didn't do any different that's right kept going with the way he was going and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass that they were in the field cain rose up and killed abel why did he kill abel not because he didn't like him not because he killed him because of what he said he killed him because he was jealous just like satan was jealous of lucifer and got all mad and ill and said all right i'm going to earth and i'm going to just mess this whole thing up watch what he did he came down got into kane got into all these different ones but now remember truly remember this we are not talking about two natural seed lines because abel was just as messed up as cain oh by the way yeah why do you need a sacrifice that's right why'd abel need a sacrifice if he was so and we know the bible says righteous abel why because god saw his righteousness because he didn't make a sacrifice amen cain would have been righteous it would have it would have recorded that but remember by election by foreknowledge god knew cain could live for a million years and still never come to the same place abel came with that revelation that's right this is the way we got to see election or you or you'll go wrong every time so in other words he killed him for his doctrine well there's your we were talking about the four horse riders which is what the first one is what white righteous church cain thought he's right the righteous indignation cain had was as he thought god should have accepted his sacrifice god should have accepted his sermon god should have accepted his denomination god should have accepted his idea amen but he didn't and then what happened he was cursed but just go through it real quick that white righteous church was the same thing in the beginning see that white righteous church thought it was right there was this white righteous church on the earth but there was also a false that came in into nicaea and what under the umbrella of religion not under the umbrella of something else it was an umbrella of religion they came together so there's your white horse then the red horse what do you do he got on his red horse and what'd the red do he killed abel because of his doctrine that's what they did in the in the middle ages they killed c right here if you see the pattern first three ages is the first horse rider second horse rider third horse rider fourth horse rider everybody got that you've been through this a hundred times you ought to say amen those of you that are awake you're going to nod in a minute and we're going to get cain into nods though all right so you got the but also you got the line ops man and eagle so you got the white horse rider now what was a red horse rider right here they killed 68 million they killed 68 million protestants because of their religions that sound familiar that's what came to table and then you see the black horse rider which what comes to a place that black horse rider it's the what intelligence of man are lutheran wesley's age ages and same way with with cain he's like my punishment is greater than i can bear a ah thou has driven me out i'll be a fugitive oh woe is me lord said now ar thou curse from the earth black horse and then what happened remember at the very end let's look at verse 16. this is where cain didn't naturally die cain spiritually died cain that's where you come to that place to where you pull that ballot box and you've marked which one you want to go and you mark it can't take it back anymore cain went out from the presence of the lord and we see what happened from then on he had a he did have a natural line have y'all noticed though that in the bible just for a little just for a little tidbit have you read in the bible how that cain had this had these children and then seth comes up and seth has children and they basically name them the same oh look kane and she conceived and bear enoch that ain't enoch that lived and got carried up in a you know in a rapture that's another enoch you see how close satan is he you watch it and i'm not going to read it but you keep going down through there and you'll see that satan names his group the same as god names his group almost you know why cuz so close so close it deceived the very elect if it were possible the very elect if it were possible and that's what we're going to talk about here in just a second all right so now let us go so we know that the four horse riders rode through there in genesis showing them cain and abel and then they didn't quit they just kept on going listen ishmael thought he was right balaam thought he was right aham thought he was right they all thought they were right they never got up one morning and said i'm wrong but now you know a true believer can do that though a true believer can get up and and and be presented with the truth and say i'm wrong but see the devil will never do that they will never do that all right so you ready let's go now look talk about election election is what let's read romans 9 verse 10 we won't be very long told you romans 9 verse 10. now remember we see that god by foreknowledge knew all this was going to happen he knew who would choose and who would not choose not that he chose god said i wish did everybody be saved right that was his desire as a god as a good god he wants everybody to be saved he's not a sadist or or anything like that he's he wants and you know what he's a liar if he didn't take god at his word folks he said i would that all be saved so god would that everybody be saved but listen according to for knowledge he knew they would not that's right all right and so that election might stand let's talk about that for a minute not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac now we're going to talk about this just for a second and then i'm going to swap back to something we're going to we're going to look at the seed lines and then go back to where we were all right because remember since cain and abel came on this earth they came by sexual desire no one else except jesus christ has come any other way no one prophet priest king you me william branham doesn't matter all but jesus christ he had to come immaculate conception to prove that that was what was supposed to happen in the garden amen he came by immaculate conception to clean the womb of the mind and then clean the natural womb and he had to come as a baby because he had to come like me and you he couldn't come like adam adam became a full-grown man but you and i have never been come out of a womb full-grown person some of you kids may think you are surprised and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by her father isaac for the child being not yet born look neither have i done any good listen before there was ever a conception listen folks before there was ever one literal conception which would be satan and eve god knew what was going to happen and he knew as much then as he knows now and he knew where you would come from and where all of us would come from so no surprises to god amen no surprises to god for the chil but listen by for knowledge he knew what you'd do when you got here and not that he would make you do something for the child being not yet born neither having done any good or evil now if you look at this and you let that stand alone you can see where that there is a predestination doctrine that is predetermined it doesn't matter it's stamped and you can't do anything different if you look at this because you would see that god always already got this thing fixed up for us but no he don't have this thing fixed by predestination he has it fixed up by four knowledge knowing what you would do knowledge beforehand that means that would be for all right because remember predestined predetermined means there is a predetermined destiny and it is a string because god knows what you're going to do before you get here but he only knows that by foreign knowledge in other words his plan and purpose is not just that this is the way it's going to be no we saw that's the way it was going to be well it's just to me it's the simplest thing but can be so convoluted until people say well i i'm just if my kids are predestinated they're just if they're if they're going to be um christians they'll be christians if they're gonna be lost they're gonna be lost you know what only god knows that and you know what i don't know enough and i'm just dumb enough to believe that my kids are going to get saved yes and that god saw that but now what did god do he saw some old grandma brother branham said four generations you never knew got down on her hands and knees and said god save my family there's election she voted for you before you even got here but what was that she was crying out to god and she believed that god would do that yes same way with you and i don't ever quit believing you say oh no see here you go my works look not of works of works but you show your faith by your work can't do away with works can't do away with works but works is not just it because remember those that come to jesus at the end time at the white throne judgment are going to say have i not work work work work work myself to death for you lord he said depart from me i never knew you you never had me inside your soul you never let me in the womb of your mind that let it drop down to the womb of your soul i'm not gonna hit you i know you're sitting there you're just kind of tall i usually can reach over you're taller than most sitting down for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil let the purpose of god look according to election now what is the election we just went through one it's a vote that's right to me it's as simple as an election is a vote yes according to election might what stand not of works but look but of him that calleth so that's what he's calling right coming to me all year labor and heavy laden i don't care if you were drunk i don't care if you were prostitute i don't care if you i don't god doesn't care about those things look at rahab look at all the people look at all the ones that we think there's no way if we you know i'm somebody said one time said if i was god i wouldn't put up with that well i thank god you're not god because he put up with that all the way down through there and by election and by foreknowledge and by the predestination of god he saw a rahab he saw this one he saw that one and right out of rahab comes david wow so don't talk to me about no natural seed line that's good and a seed line that's bad and there's no way to cross them come on i'm gonna read you right here in just a minute what happened now we know listen we know for a fact standing in the garden of eden there was only four people at the time adam eve cain abel all right and cain was the seed of the beast seed of the so he had a natural seed line he had a dna that was like his father the beast and then when adam and eve got together and had abel there's your twins again got had abel that was adam's natural seed and he looked like adam so now when you start at the beginning there is two natural seed lines but you got to look at those and see though that cain and abel abel wasn't righteous because he was on this side and cain wasn't doomed because he was on this side i just showed you god came to this side and said if you'll do as well as this one does and he's not talking about abel he said if thou do us well well means if you'll do what i said then what then you can come over here yes but there was true a natural seed line but i'm gonna tell you we're gonna get down here in just a few minutes and you can't find that thing you can't find the natural seed line you're going to have to look at the spiritual seed line because when cain turned god down and went out of the presence of god that did create also a seed in the womb of cain's mind because watch his people his people were um they built cities see the attitudes and all they had and then able side with seth were sheep herders and all these different things we'll read it just a second but according to election not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated now if he hated esau just by purely hating hating him he's wrong he cannot be a righteous judge if he hates somebody before he gives them a chance to even breathe so we must go back to foreknowledge for knowing that jacob would love the birthright and that esau would not there's where it split there's your split jacob have i loved and he saw have i hated all right now romans 8 verse 30. that's where we get in for whom he did for no he also did predestinate what is first for knowledge then at for knowledge you can predetermine by your free moral agency you will determine god's just going to let you go sure now god influences we know god will nudge you over this way or nudge you over this way but so will the devil amen you got two shoulders right one for the devil and one for god and your brain's right in the middle right but remember what satan does is right here if you're born again he can't get right here amen this has to come up and you know what god knows that so by foreign knowledge he knew you would accept him and he knew exactly what you would need to bring that thing up called the holy ghost the guide called the one that when you have this little check in your heart right i didn't have that when i was a center i never was checked nothing i just went and did what i wanted to can i get some one person or two to raise their hand i did what i wanted to i did what i wanted to but when god came knocking up here he said boy you need to stop what you're doing and i said father god right here save my soul forgive me of what i've done yes and you know what that laundry list that i had sure satan keeps pulling it up in my mind amen every day and reminds me of what i used to be god don't know that because by foreign knowledge by foreknowledge he has wiped his mind of what you did because he can't predetermine by your sin that's fresh i didn't even think of that but he can't predetermined by your sin if you're a child of god if he saw you come to being a child a son and daughter of god he came predetermined by the laundry list that i keep talking about you know well i it's like daddy said daddy never drank he never smoked you never cussed but he was lost yes but you and i go well i drank i smoked i run around i did all that i did i did i but boy i'm a better christian than he is no using worse shape than he was because he thought he's right better than most because i don't do those things no you were born in sin shaping iniquity come to this world lost doomed and on your way to hell your soul is as black as night sorry everybody even the prophet of god had to come to a day to ask god to forgive him don't you remember the time that brother brown said i used to wash my car on sunday and watch people go to church that's right because you didn't have god in here but once he had that experience it took that same person and he put him in church for whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be what conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called now he called everybody there listen god can't be a just god and one person of the billions it's been since the beginning of time of the billions can walk up one day and say god you never gave me a chance then he's gonna have to just wipe the whole thing out and give everybody eternal life but you know what he's gonna do he's gonna say okay buddy on december the 15th at four o'clock in the afternoon i came to you three times and you turned me down all three times you know what that person's gonna do in their mind they're gonna go yep moreover whom he did predestinate them he also calls so he calls everybody but he only predetermines he predetermines by what his foreknowledge so he knew what you would do when you at when when he called you he knew what you would respond because in whom he called then he also justified now look without foreknowledge he cannot do this last part of this of this uh quote or last part of the scripture without foreknowledge because look there's a lot of people have come to justification that will not come to glorification bible says believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved he'll forgive you your sins that justifies you but it don't take it don't take the unclean spirit out he's still in there and you'll go on and continue to keep doing that until god flushes that thing out oh yeah right and whom he justified them he also glorified so there is a group of people that looks like on this side that there's a seed line that just there's no way you cannot make it and there is if he saw you before the foundation of the world want it more than life itself he gave you like i said before that's what i'm coming to he gave you a paul he gave you a john he gave you a irenaeus mart he gave you william branham he gave you samuel dale he gave you luis urego he gave you aaron roberts he gave you all these different brothers a priest by black he gave you that yes right amen to bring you to perfection because he's not gonna lose a one he said not one why because of foreign knowledge he knew you would want it more in life itself or that you wouldn't both ways or that you would not but now let's not think we're so righteous that we're on this side over here and we can't be moved now let's let god handle that it's god's grace folks because sometimes we might lean a little bit over here on this side you heard what i said we fall we stumble we make mistakes but god give us what a type host right here to say god forgive me lord forgive me of what i've done why because we still are human but let's go to genesis 6 verse 1. let's let we do there is no doubt a line that's called bride but it is never a natural line it is a spiritual line because when jesus came to nicodemus and said you must be born again nicodemus he went back to the natural line he said i got to go back and get in my mother's womb in other words have another conception from my mom and my daddy so that i could be right jesus said no you've got to be born from above this down here is what's killing you so let's look and see just for a minute genesis 6 verse 1. now remember there was two natural lines of cain and abel well not sorry cain is seth abel didn't have a line abel died before he had children so it had to be seth everybody got that say amen all right not able but seth because remember seth was raised up by still a conception between adam and eve after all that they had another kid but then they started calling on the name of the lord and there was a natural for a little while but in genesis 6 verse 1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives now watch of all which they chose which they chose so there's your intermingling of the seed natural seed so there's no way from this point from this point on you're gonna have a hard time finding the natural seed line and it's gonna get even worse when we read the next scripture when noah gets out of the ark and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with men for he is also flesh yet his days shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days now we know that came from cain we know that and also after that when the sons of god came in and to the daughters of men all of them mingled and they bare white children to them there's your next generation of children natural the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and you see all this nimrod and you see all these dif you see everything mingling back in together so forget about if you're on the cane lynn is your oak your serpent's saying if you're on able or south side you're you're fine no because remember we've got to go back to election the bible says according to election yes we'll look at that in just a second so now let's go to genesis 9 verse 1. they've got out of the ark now there's only noah his wife the three boys and the three girls which was the wives of of the the boys right they're about ham sham and j-path they did have all wives and god told them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth well here they go again and they're marrying intermingly marrying with their family where's the seedline at it becomes spiritual now because watch we know one thing's for sure ham did wrong whatever he did we've heard different stories on that but he just he just turned god down while the other ones went on the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were sham ham and japath and ham as the father of canaan see that's what gets me is ham as the father of canaan and canaan is the promised land you see how god is just when he wrote the bible he just throwed it in there to where you can't figure out without the holy ghost you can't figure out what god's doing these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth over spread so out of three sons and three daughter-in-laws no one ever had any more kids out of three sons and three daughter-in-laws they repopulated what you see today so there's no way god hid that thing so deep now we know that brother brown they asked him a question about the serpent seed well we know what happened with the serpent seed it came over in the ark in the men and the women because they went back to doing what happened before they went back multiplying and replenishing and intermarrying and intermingling amen kind of simple let's look at this right here let's look at the countdown let's see how simple brother brown makes this now we're talking about the election how would god act when he come into human flesh look and he what he was when he was in human flesh what did he brag about being it no sir he said i do nothing until my i see my father show it to me first look how he proved himself how his a vindication of being the messiah he was a prophet he knew he could tell the people he perceived their thoughts he knowed their hearts he knowed all about you he knows what you've done and he knows what you need he can speak to you through your conscience tell you try to show it to you now look the devil will sit on the other shoulder and say look the other way depends on which way you want to look now throws it every bit back to you that's all look they said in the election god voted for you and the devil voted against you now that's 1-1 god voted for you the devil voted against you now there's a vote swinger in there somewhere it's got to be two to one one side or the other and who swings the vote now where you cast your vote is going to determine where you're going that's right you've got to take christ you've got to take his word you've got to believe him and the bible said he was the same yesterday and then forever then he's got to be the same exactly now do you believe that raise up your hand because we're going to vote today raise up your hand how many would want to be an astronaut of god he's talking about countdown they said i can stay away from organizations and believe in christ now let's go to a trumpet gives an uncertain sound 1963. someone said to me the other day are you going to vote this election he said i done voted oh in this election i said i voted for jesus i said i'll tell you there was two people voting for me i said god voted for me the devil voted against me and i voted for god so i got my vote right depends on where you cast your vote how are you going to come out now by foreknowledge he knew that not by predetermining by foreknowledge he knew that you would want it more than life itself amen then we took them then he talked about the national natural election which we just went through and it happened the same way you you get to so many votes over here and you get so many votes over here of course we got electoral college where you got all that stuff and yada yada but listen i only care about what god voted for me and satan voted against me there's your two seed lines but you got to decide whether you want to be part of this one or you want to stay by your natural seed and stay over here on this one with satan amen you determine everything you do even in life even in little simple life but do we ask god to help us with that all right let's go to galatians 3 16 because we've we've we want to see just a few of these people here and then we'll then we'll quit now to abraham and his seed were the promises made seed because remember abraham had ishmael natural seed and he had natural seed isaac and then sarah died he married keturah and had seven more natural children right nobody got that so god wasn't coming to abraham and saying all these seeds well no he's talking about one that's the only seed i'm worried about the only seed that i want representing me and to be inside of me is this one right here and to see he saith not into seeds as of many because these are examples it's not a see i switch this one up so it'll confuse you because i put all the good people on this side and all the bad people on that side see what i mean it's not that it could have went either way because of election god voted and i saw what isaac would do and what ishmael would do he saw what jacob was doing what he saw and do he saw what moses and balaam would do he saw what elijah and ahab would do because he's talking about the twins showing up at every revival right and he says as not to cease as of many but as a one now remember christ never had natural children jesus christ never had a natural child so he come knowing that he could though he was a human mortal man from top of his head to the bottom of his feet but he didn't come to bring natural children into the world he came to bring spiritual children into the world so that we would have a vote amen we could have a chance a vote amen sister i say thank you jesus myself and to thy seed which is christ christ came to bring us a spiritual seed he did not come to bring us a natural seed natural seed is what's killing us so you see this line real quick here's kane and abel we saw how that got convoluted and there's no way there can be a cane line and an able line or a seth line no okay now pay attention these two here came from the same daddy so it couldn't be seedline amen they both came from abraham now we know this one came from the beast and this one came from adam but when you get right here when you get right here no this is not but when you get right here where god said jacob have i love and he saw how i hated they came out of the same womb they had same natural daddies same natural dna but what happened afterwards election by election jacob wanted that birthright more than esau so that put him in a line of election god voted for him satan voted against him moses moses and balaam look balaam was close balaam was a prophet of god amen anointed prophet of god but what did he do he got israel he couldn't curse him but he was smart enough through what but through the intelligence of satan he yielded toward that by election he chose satan and said i can't curse you but i sure can make you marry the wrong people i sure can put you the sons of god and the daughters of men again i can put you down here and remember god told them he said do not mingle with the world that's right you marry your own your own line your own kind you marry you're through in your 12 tribes and balaam is going hmm see the strewness of satan balaam tried three or four times to curse israel being a prophet of god he could not because remember he kept going back to baylock he said i can't do it god won't allow me to do it but what kept what balaam kept going and yielded to who the devil and the devil said just have them intermingle in mass that god will be mad at him and that's what happened he said have a marry bring these real pretty and these real pretty sodomites and he's real pretty bring them up there and let them intermingle and what happened was god had to curse israel because of what happened elijah and ahab but look it's not natural seed lines though it's what they did with the word they were given that's my bottom line that's my bottom statement it's what each one of these did with the word of god right it's what each one of these did right here first this womb was messed up on every one of them except this one first but then what they did with it put them over on one side or the other side amen pretty simple in it but that's the whole thing with election according to election you say brother wade i don't have a chance who told you that let's stand our feet musicians come who told you that did god tell you that can you find it in the word of god finding the word of god somewhere where god said you ain't got a chance i think he said come to me all you the labor and heavy laden and i'll give you rest he didn't take away and he didn't say well now if you're of this line you can't of this line you can't of this line you can i just want to be part of the line of the tribe of judah that lie that's the line i want to be uh associated with let me read this quote real quick that brother uh joe sent me and and um brother durrett was quoting from from this from that time because we've come to a place that we did have an election the other day 1960 brother brown said i don't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's nation it's the number 13. it appears in the 13th chapter of revelations 13 stars 13 stripes everything's 13 everything is a woman and remember thus saith the lord there will be a woman ruled before the end time she will either be president vice president or it will be the catholic church as a woman i've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus saith the lord write it down and find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't i'm a false prophet well we just elected a woman vice president of color which is fine i don't bother me a bit but it fulfills exactly and now you know biden's a catholic and we know all that's and and and i'm not worried like brother brown said he said i'm and i'm not democrat or republican but you do look at things as human beings and as people that have to live in the united states of america but the united states the other day there was an election and they chose what they chose and now you got to live with it now let's go in the spiritual you're going to have to make a choice there's an election in your life and it's not every four years it's every day of your life god voted for you the devil voted against you you swing that bow let's sing a song it's that simple you don't have a laundry lid you don't have to stand on your head you don't have to go to do novenia's and do it you don't no believe what god said and we believe a prophet came in the end time to give us clarity to know what was coming this world don't know what's coming we know what's coming [Music] we'll praise [Music] for i will praise will praise the lord no matter what tomorrow brings what it hasn't [Music] heavenly father we gather together as the family of god and our brother and sister lord is their natural family their natural lineage lord that satan is trying to attack this young child lord we pray in the name of jesus christ as they take these costs and they apply them to the baby all the whole family lord that you will vindicate what you've said lord that you'll raise them up for your honor and glory lord we believe there'll be a good report father when this happens in jesus name we pray amen you just believe just like we did for mary same thing will happen oh i will pray the lord [Music] no matter what tomorrow brings what [Music] and now i pray in the name of jesus christ and that this blood pressure will go down and not ever bother our sister again in the name of jesus christ lord we pray these things amen and amen [Music] no matter what tomorrow brings our white hat [Music] lord i'm gonna love him will love the lord i will love and i pray lord that our faith will bind together lord we feel that he's prayed lord with earnest prayer now father we pray also lord that if it be us even standing in that position we'd want somebody to pray as earnest as they could father so in the name of jesus christ we pray that the scales will come back off of our brother's eyes lord as you did with paul and many ones down through time lord you heal their blindness lord so i pray in the name of jesus christ that you'll touch our brother lord regardless of what age regardless of what the doctor says lord it's just a lying devil and we pray in jesus name that you'll raise our brother up and give him victory in jesus name we pray lord amen you believe you just get up looking every day just get up looking for god to do something every day i will praise the lord amen you love the lord [Music] election you got everything to do with it but it's not by works it's by living the word of god have you tried your best i've never tried my best i'm human i have all these different things that go on in in life and all that you know but i still got an anchor that says if you'll do what i say come back and do what i say then he'll do what he said because he promised he would god voted for you satan's going to always vote against you you swing the vote you know i was reading the other day you take this great prophet brother durant that saw i don't say he saw thousands i say it's almost millions of healings brother brown saw millions of healings in his in his campaign 250 000 in one service and he's standing there under the anointing of god and he says [Music] basically a positive mental attitude toward any promise of god you don't gotta jump through a hoop young guy saying no venus you don't have to pay the preacher he said a positive attitude toward any promise of god [Music] will bring it to pass and we say oh we gotta build it amen a positive mental attitude toward any promise of god now listen we're not preaching mind over matter but i'm telling you something it has been proven even by scientists that what happens up here has a lot to do with your body [Music] so if you'll let the holy ghost put that together amen supposed to have the mind of christ right and then you just start confessing it just start saying it don't worry about what happens if you can't see tomorrow don't worry about tomorrow you got another day fear brings torment don't fear positive mental attitude toward any promise of god will bring it to pass that's so simple it goes right over the top of most people it just goes right over and nobody nobody can stand against it [Music] after i guess after the service okay all right you wanna do it now sis sure come on come on yes ma'am come right here thank the lord jesus it's so good to be here with y'all y'all have no idea um i want to give a testimony um i want to give my life testimony but it's not going to be today it's for something else that life testimony has to be kind of put some note down and so i can make it come out clear but first of all i just want to introduce the lord jesus christ because he did something for me the other day and um what you just was speaking about just pump me up just come up here and um something happened um the other day with me and my son and um he was at school and one of his math teachers called me and stated that you know isaac was having a little trouble in class so y'all can sit down if you want it might take a minute i won't take too long cause i know y'all got cake and ice cream anyway um his math teacher called me and said you know isaac's having a little trouble in class and he wanted me to speak with isaac when he gets home so that things can get resolved so isaac can um move forward so i said okay i'll talk to him and isaac came home and of course you know as a mother you talking to him and kind of scolding him and trying to get him to start making the right choices um and i'm not gonna lie i'm gonna keep it real sometime for me when things get frustrating i'll handle it kind of like how i normally would would be maybe fuss you know you got to get together your future and and this you know and you you got to get together my mind goes all into the future of what's going to happen if you fail and fear takes over next thing you know i'm yelling i'm kind of scolding i'm fearful i'm looking into the future so i'm taking it out on him in that kind of way like you can't keep doing this and you know whatever so anyway um the math teacher called me i think maybe maybe a week or two later or something i might be getting my dates mixed up so forgive me call me maybe a week or two later um isaac's still getting a little trouble this is a good testimony so i hope i get embarrassed but um calls me again and says you know yeah you know i've been talking to isaac i really want the best for isaac and you know but i can't keep dealing with this you know disruptiveness so i'm like okay i'm embarrassed i'm like what else to do you know i'm tired of talking i'm tired of um i'm just tired you know um it's just me and isaac his dad is in africa so it's kind of just been me raising him so you know it's when everything's on you you kind of like woof you know um so i'm like you know okay all right i i'll talk to isaac again so this time i kind of gave up a little bit in a way i said isaac look if you keep acting up you're gonna have to get the consequences to go with that you already know what what they say will happen so if you go in there make the wrong choice again that's what's gonna happen i can't keep babying you i can't keep talking to you it's not making any difference so you're going to have to know when you make a choice it's going to be a consequence after that so this time um oh i think i told him this too i said you know what this time i'm just going to give it to god whatever you do you're going to have to pay for that consequence that's real life lesson so um i think uh the teacher something happened i think they called me again and this time i said you know what don't talk to isaac anymore if he does something matter of fact don't even give them strike two send them out send them where you gotta go because you warned them i warned them nobody has to keep talking you shouldn't have to keep talking so um he said okay i told isaac i said isaac whatever happens i'm putting this in god hand now and i told god god you got to be right you got to help me i don't know how to be the right parent i don't know what else to do to get the right results i don't know i just got to give this over to you take it next thing i know i really felt myself giving it to god like whatever happens maybe he has to go through things where he can learn hey it's a consequence maybe too much forgiveness might not be good for him maybe he need to really suffer and go through things so he can realize hey whatever i do i gotta pay for that in some kind of way that might be the best lesson for him so um next thing i know that same day the teacher calls me and says a different situation happened as it got into a fight the same day now and i'm like okay what in the world isaac gets in their fight and they say they're going to suspend him three days but this time i was calm because i already gave it over to god i said okay that's that's what got to happen let it happen um that's fine normally i would have been kind of embarrassed not sure what to say kind of like boy i don't know what to tell this you know i taught him when he get home you know normally you nervous you feel embarrassed and but this time i said okay just just let it happen and somehow i felt god was into this somehow i felt something was going to come out of this so i'm sitting at a table uh i think when i got home and forgive me i might be getting mixed up i'm just trying to remember to the best of my knowledge i think when i got home i was sitting at a table and i was thinking i was somehow you know i got to speak to you and he's not talking but he's speaking to your mind and he starts saying you know just think about how i how i parent you when you're doing something wrong or if you make a choice i don't force you i go ahead and let you do what you want to do matter of fact he just took me out of the world he just took me out of a backslidden position straight up a very he let go and let that devil have his way with me too it was tormenting and he had to let me go through that sure you know what i'm saying so he can get me back thank god so um he just started speaking to me and said when you made your choice you knew there was going to be consequences but i just let you go because i'm not going to force you to do anything i can tell you i can warn you but i'll let you go i still love you so that's what i want you to do with isaac when he comes home don't fuss at him be very nice to him matter of fact don't even say nothing to him he just got the punishment they already scold him they already told him what was going to happen he know he's getting suspended you don't need to fuss and yell at him anymore you don't need to say anything matter of fact and he really dropped it in my heart like you don't need to get mad he got the punishment he got the consequence you don't need to tell him about it they already been doing it matter of fact love him this is your chance to be that real mother and show him love don't even say anything when he get home matter of fact fix him his favorite meal love on him he's gonna need your love if anything and he's dropping this to me i'm like wow i never ever handle anything like that wow that's all it takes to give it to god and just let him drop what you need to do man i could have saved years of trouble so um he said just love him don't say nothing shut your mouth matter of fact and i'm like wow i mean just dropping so smooth so much peace came over me like oh my god i don't have to say anything emma geez thank you so um isaac gets home and he's looking at me because normally i'm like you know what you about to you know this time he's wondering why he's so quiet why are you so humble and and he's looking at me thinking i'm gonna just snap and you know he start just looking at me kind of weird i'm like what you want to eat you know what you want and uh he started picking up his own laundry putting it in the machine and everything i'm like man that's all it took you know like walk like this oh my god um he started picking up his laundry and just putting in the machine and just doing things i'm like oh my god that's all it took just so anyway i asked him what he want to eat i didn't say anything i didn't say nothing and it gets better um it was so peaceful not to say nothing it was so peaceful just to see what god is doing we end up ending that night like that um the next morning we didn't have internet access and he needed that to do his school work um one of the parents that he know have a child at home school she invited isaac over to do his work there that was a blessing because i didn't have any internet or anything but here's the best part two days later two days later one of the uh coaches called me and left a message and said hey call me back i really need to tell you something isaac did and it's a life lesson for all of us so in my mind i'm like what in the world could that be right so um i call back and he says um isaac did something and i just got to bring it to your attention because this is something we all can learn from so i'm like what in the world you know what is it he says uh when isaac first came to that school now isaac when we left from baltimore um not too long ago isaac didn't want to go it was one of those situations it was the right season the right time and i had to make a choice to god or whatever i'm going to however i'm going to live or god so it's one of those things you got to just let go of everything and just go and uh so isaac you know it was hard for him because he you know he don't he didn't understand everything but anyway um that that coach said when isaac got to that school you know um isaac was sitting in the cafeteria and he ended up sitting at the wrong table the wrong area and uh he said one of the teachers came up to him and kind of was scolding him in a certain kind of a way and asking him you know why are you sitting here you're not supposed to sit here or something like that so he said he never seen a child or even adult so calm the way that teacher came at him isaac was like you know oh i apologize i didn't know i couldn't sit here this is my first day you know or something like that i apologize but the way he expressed it was like i never seen nobody handle herself so you know um in control like that you know i just need to bring that to your attention he said in the second thing when isaac got into that fight i was the one that broke the fight up he said but here's the thing that got me he said um isaac was telling me you know that the guy kept picking at him or something so you know they end up getting to a fight he said but here's the thing when i broke them up there was you know it was it was you know when you get to fight you your attitude is like here he said most of the time it takes a child or even an adult to come down a little bit you can't just go from 100 to zero right right away he said but when i talked to isaac isaac came down like from a hundred to zero like in no time and he said i've never seen that before and he was so amazing and like i i've never seen anything like that that's that's a lesson for i mean he was just i never heard anybody call and express it the way it touched him so in my mind i'm like wow but here's the point two days prior like what i was saying if i would have gotten upset without it there you go and handle things differently i wouldn't have seen what god wanted to receive two days later god is gonna take care of your children if you give it to him whatever it is just like you were saying you know what i'm saying give it to god and let go let him drop in your mind what to do it might you know sometimes it take time for it to get to that place what i'm saying is let go when you get to that point where you can't do it no more and sometimes that's the best one you can't do it no more let god drop to you what to do and it works better that way as a matter of fact you'd be like why didn't i know this sooner but oh my god i just want to give the god the glory i never had a phone call since after that i mean it's been it's been a blessing it's been thank you jesus praise the lord amen [Applause] amen we mess up when we mess up when we go when we try to do how many times have we tried to do it ourself so it's just human sister we just try to do it ourselves let's stand our feet praise the lord give god the glory amen let go and let god amen i've seen that before let go and let god thank you jesus i promise you one thing you can't save them you can't make them change god's gonna have to do it he changed me my mama tried to save me for 20 years didn't happen for a second but when god got a hold of me he saved my soul amen that's right brother your mama needs to pray for you that's for sure but god's one that does a saving but he knows your mom and dad is praying for you there you go back to the election and you go back to foreign knowledge see because if we think it predetermined we just go well it's going to happen it's just the way it is it's just the way that that's why i don't like that it is what it is i don't like that anyway what if god would have said that it is what it is take it or leave it no that's what cain told god this is all i got take it or leave it well he left it but when you go to god and say god i ain't got no more you gonna have to change it because i can't change you you're gonna have to do it cause there's no way i can do it man has never saved a person oh you might have physically saved somebody's life but you can't give them eternal life only god can give eternal life amen so let's bow our heads and be dismissed thank god for our pastor yes we'll downstairs we'll go out there and have a little cake and ice cream we'll i'm
