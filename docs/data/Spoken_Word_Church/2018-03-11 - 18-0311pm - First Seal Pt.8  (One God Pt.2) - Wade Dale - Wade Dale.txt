hands brother Joseph Canada said need to meet with all the musicians and song leaders after the second service in front of the church rain or shine now Joe does that mean this front or at that front Joseph which front does that mean that front or that front that front so y'all gonna get wet that front is this a test inside inside okay in front of the church right here not out there it just says in front of the church I would think it might have been outside okay misinterpret a is mr. turpitude theology brother Larry gets us in trouble right Larry OD all right let's turn up let's go and get started because we got a lot of things we got to cover today since it's been a couple of weeks I hope you still enjoying the the first seal will be finished with it I I thought we may be finished with it today but solve something else this morning that we need to cover that I believe will really help you so let's turn to revelation 6 good to have everybody here good to have a brother Brown and sister Joan with us thank you for getting here thank you very much and we pray that the Lord will bless you all and we've been on the first seal now this would be number eight for those of you that are looking for number seven part seven if you'll remember we were had a power failure and during the service the power went off well when the power goes off it resets the internet so we had nothing past that except the audio so but we're gonna try to cover a little bit more today and what we did back then and then going a little bit further some revelation 6 verse 1 let's bow our heads Hendley father Lord as we always say please be the active participant in this service you'd be the one that does the speaking you'd be the one that does the hearing and you're the only one that can give revelation I pray that you would anoint us all Lord not just the speaker but annoying everyone in the building so that we may hear from you today Father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make bless the missionaries that are on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor or just be with each one around the country all the little bride of Jesus Christ is their symbol today that you'll give them strength and revelation also Lord because that's what we live off of we live off Revelation and we need that more than anything father just be with us take care of us in to further than this service may everything be done for your honor and glory in Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him out of bow and the crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing for the reading of the work I'm going to bring to get the chart out again today if that's all right I see mom put it up she doesn't like things to be stuck out all over the place so she put it back my mother says Amen here he does not like to have things stuck where they shouldn't be so I know I know you all you sisters do agree with her on that but us men are like it's a fine right where it's at it's not in the way right right brothers it's not in the way that ranch has been there for six months we'll need it eventually and if you move it somewhere else I've seen daddy look all day for stuff mama put up right Susan and Don ears fighting over the same thing at the moment so we're good to be here and we will I tell you what I did I found something the other day and I'm gonna look for it you see how Glary that is intense even in the back said you can't hardly see that well I was looking on one of my beach hats last night and the guy in Australia he uses a yellow background and it's it's not yellow it's more of an orange yellow but man you talk about seeing the the the the black just jumps out so I may try to either paint that thing or or try to find this one but some of you in the back I'm sorry if you can't see it but I'll try to write big so you can see it that we do the best we can with what we got all right so now we're in this seal where we're out still in the first seal and we're working toward just for a background for a minute let me get Joe go and pull that one up brother Joe let's let's show the one that we always do because I believe that that as we've said before the the breaking of the seal is not necessarily for the soul now don't get me wrong in you you that's been here know what I'm saying there's going to be millions upon millions of people in the bride of Jesus Christ that never had the seals open to them now they live through them amen they got revelation off of the seals that are in the Bible because the seals is the entire Bible but they never come to the revelation of the opening of the seals like we have amen so the breaking of the seals is not necessarily for the soul because the soul is redeemed by the new birth the blood of Jesus Christ and man not of the opening of the seals not that a prophet came amen amen it comes by believing on the shed blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary that's what brother Dale has been preaching on salvation through justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost which we believe 100% amen but it will bring full fellowship back into manifestations that God and man can now commune or than they've ever been able to commune why because the devil's been exposed and he's riding away from your revelation and man he's riding away from your revelation so as we said many times before and we'll get into it real quick just the background that when the seals you know the property God told us he was talking about this and that back when the in John when he saw it when the seals were wrote they weren't written in a book brother Brian understands this because this is even the Torah now the original Torah is folded out like this has folded in folded ounce out like this the trains rolled out so the seal had whatever was inside sealed up where man couldn't see it so now we realize that the prophet of God come to what now not the prophet of God but God himself through the Prophet and then the God himself through the prophets stood there on those days of those seals and broke this part a man took the seal off but he told us what this seal was this seal is the Antichrist not Jesus Christ but in but I am sorry but we've been here 50 60 something years since the seals broke and the seals are the headstone to the church the the total redemption of body spirit and soul amen to change our body to get us out of here because no one else had this revelation because what you can't read that in this form something had it sealed up and it was sealed up under the mystery of iniquity like we were talking about this had to be exposed first so as the seal broke the problem with us is though we're weird like I said before where's we're we're so caught up with this and forget about this because remember I wrote you a quote we're not gonna read it today cuz I just pulled some a few quotes out this is not going to change your body this will change your body the revelation underneath the seal because just knowing that Satan as the Antichrist it's not going to change your body then you Satan was Antichrist in John's day back in the first church he called him an antichrist amen but Satan had it sealed up the prophet of God comes in the end time to break that seal and tell us that's the wild horse rider and there he goes riding through those church ages but now remember the quote that I read you that the seals and the thunders are two different things right I read you the closer the seals and the thunders are two different things so we have the revelation of the seals right there in the book property God preached seven messages Amen but the Thunder is what you and I which is the voice of God not seven men not polygamy how in the world can that be take a body change and have seven wives and I mean what's your body to have to change if you had seven one promised you that you'd be a mental cave and the dog said amen [Music] but the revelation was a revelation of Jesus Christ we saw the opposition we're going to look at in just a minute and I'm gonna show you next well I'm not snakes on you but the next honey what happened in those church ages because like I said before let's stop right here we know the prophet of God preached the church ages all right amen six seven everybody got that say man that's the church ages I'm not gonna draw the little what you know what he put it the light he put in there but this these was what this was the lion and look I'm gonna do like God does he makes overlaps a man that all right can we do that go this is the Ox the man and the white eagle I was thinking the other day now a lion is very strong but when it's a baby what does it drink milk then it progresses the meat they were pretty strong in this church age right now an ox when the Ox babies born it drinks milk but then it just eats Christ amen I'm getting somewhere with this the man even when the man you'll find out out in a little while sister the man has a baby and it what does it drink but it grows up and progresses to eat meat but now an eagle never drinks milk a baby eagle has mama preacher why you have to have faithful ministry mama preacher choose the big pieces of meat I wish this was true in the church and shoves it down the throat I'm asked what she does she shoved it down his throat but she breaks it up in little pieces so the Eagle can understand what they're eating that Alright saying man so the Eagle never drinks milk but now these others a lion boy tear you up and kill you but the baby starts drinking milk at first aid second age third age fourth fifth six right up even to number seven here in the Eagle Age you and I eat meat we are meat eaters even the baby eagle is born with the hook and born with talons amen because they're going to eat meat that's you and I we're gonna eat meat strong me then alright say man so in the first church age the first three ages now we're going to come up here like this and we're going to show you something if that's all right we're gonna do the same thing now brother branham told us that the rapture takes place on the fourth seal right we're getting a little head of ourselves but we need to do we need this some background the rapture takes place on the fourth seal why because all the combat beats are gone he says that all the combat beasts are gone so so we must not assume know that those four combat beasts or what that's the that's the inspiration of the Holy Ghost through the church ages and the property God really told us we needed all of them in this age amen but the lion ox man and Eagle after that fourth seal the fifth seal doesn't say and the fifth beast said come and see right it was four beats that said come and see and they came and they saw but brother Ram said yeah after the fourth seal you don't see those combat B so therefore the rapture takes place on one two three four seal when's the rapture takes place seven churches very simple but now people will you know throw a wrench well you've got three more seals we'll get into that but if the rapture takes place on the fourth seal or after the fourth seal then we must put them in two that the first seal types the first three ages brother Brown says this we already know that then you've got an overlap coming into the second then the third and then the fourth you got the white horse rider the red horse rider the black horse rider and the pale horse rider all right black red I mean sorry white black red and all those mixed together right there I got that same am all right so what we're doing is is we're looking at this seal when the seal break it shows us redemption because what what is uh let me put it this way doesn't matter what messenger come you know and in the Book of Revelations we read it next Sunday you got revelation two and three in there that tells to the church of ephesus i right now we know the property God put Paul Iranian Martin Columba Luther Wesleyan and himself in those slots but remember that messenger received a message from God and it just didn't seal him away it sealed the people away a man the bride was being built in these seven churches there's no other Gentile bride outside of those seven churches hey man because we're because when we leave it goes to the Jews no more Gentile Church ages amen so we've got seven church ages that builds the body and then the head comes and picks us up without the headstone here we're not going out and then because that's the problem with all these ages they didn't have the headstone message in other words they didn't have the opening of the seals because there had to come a prophet in the end time a divine interpreter of the Word of God to not only tell us what this seal is that had kept this hid but to also reveal the thunders the voice of God when the seal breaks there's something underneath there that you and I have got to have a man that okay and then it's been hitting the Bible it's not a new Bible it's the same Bible but it took a prophet a divine interpreter of the Word of God but our problem there's a lot of times we go you'll ask most people in the message you'll say what is the revelation of the seals awesome Antichrist it's an answer where is redemption in an antichrist the Thunder is the voice of God not the voice of the devil but it's not the voice of God to anybody it's to those who will listen he that have to hear let him hear what the Spirit says to the church hey man mama ego breaking down the meat giving it to you but you know why when you grow up you do the same thing with little Eagles that come up under you you chew the word you pull out a little piece here and there and you put it down the throat some choke but to restore full fellowship this is the only way it could go he was saved at 70 weeks of Daniel him he had to come in and break it for the Gentiles hey man there were 70 weeks determined of the Jews not to us amen but he broke it he broke the 69th week he broke it amen and then a Gentile church come there but when we leave that last week is to the redemption of the Jews and regeneration of the earth to put us in the Millennium that all right say Amen and you know as well as I do there's much contention about is it a half week or there's no half simbop in the Bible there's no half week he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week when is that one week gonna start when we leave amen well we believe that here Phil you know why I call this what the Bible says that's what the Bible says he said well I got quotes what have you got what the Bible says you can't make brother Brown say nothing what the Bible didn't say Amen just gotta have revelation right so you got that's why we feed off of that meat we feed off of that revelation we feed off of of strong meat we don't forget the milk I like milk my life state I don't think I've ever had Milt with my steak but I've had cornbread and milk that was good yeah but steak and baked potatoes good for you it'll make you whole but some of you more hold another but the doctor always told me said you need to get in shape I said doc round is a shape all right I make you laugh cuz you go fall asleep you everybody lost an hour last night well some did ones that didn't turn the clock back didn't but our go forward didn't but you see the layout so now we know that when brother Brown says the rapture takes place on the fourth seal we don't go bonkers cuz where's the end of the fourth seal right here at this church age because the Holy Ghost leaves the earth amen all right but you get we're gonna we got to stop right here with number one because in the first three ages it's parallel or tight with that first seal that all right say ma'am we've already been through this but just a little background so we're looking at the book of redemption excuse me the book of redemption has the names of all the redeemed right and where are the redeemed in those Church ages they're not out of the and the listen don't be technical the bride never was in an age but there were seven Church ages we are absolutely in a Laodicean Church age you know why cuz I'm sweating and I'm fishing to go turn the air conditioner on all right Richard you want to get the other thing about 71 but she asked lay out I said we live and lay out and see it but we've been caught up out of the age listen we don't paint like the age we shouldn't we don't think like the layout of scene age those people are weird and weird thoughts I'm talking about beeping the message you don't think I'm nobody blush under but let's get on the seal the characteristic of the first seal was what it was why horse rider it was a white horse which was a power it was white because he didn't want to make it any other dark ugly muddy color Satan wanted to be so close to win but look and to law of contrast as the property gardens teaches us the law of contrast is Satan never is an originator right Satan has nothing he don't even have a seed to reproduce yourself and why are we scared of somebody that don't even have he can reproduce yourself he can't make an original thought he can't you see how powerless he is he waits for God to step forward and then right behind him not less far behind him this far behind as soon as God brings something original Satan comes in and perversion join the first church age God had a white righteous church on the earth hey man you say oh no that was a wild horse rider he had to be in opposition to something he's not an originator so there was a white righteous church no denomination no Father Son Holy Ghost baptism no this eternal hell stuff all this other stuff that denominations have come up in the ages that was not in those first three Church ages sure it became them as I saying I'll read it in a minute if we get to it I may not get to it today the way this is going but I'm kind of background kind of refreshing everybody's memory but the first three ages they had water baptism right they didn't have to get up and preach and correct another denomination right they'd have a Baptist on the corner in the Memphis on this corner and presidency on this corner and Paul went and tried to convert them all no Paul was converting raw heathens like Lewis was talking this morning the Romans he said to the Romans like that said the Corinthians all these were idol worshipers Paul was going among the idol worshipers and he walks in that day and he sees that little place that says to the unknown God Paul says I want to talk to you about that one that's the one I know because it must be unknown to you but it's not unknown to me so in those first Church ages there was a white righteous church on the earth all right so in opposition Satan slides right in then go to the bar rooms and try to convert nobody he goes to the champion tries to convert people he starts sleeping impulses grievious wolves are among you now they men so Satan's seat walked right in and sits down beside of God amen and so powerful that at the end of this third church aids in there and that Nicean council listen to me I want you to listen to this he converts a world of Christians to a false doctrine did he not Colombo was a Trinitarian Martin Luther was a Trinitarian John Wesley was a Trinitarian and the first part of Pentecost was a Trinitarian God wing-tipped their ignorance though amen eternal hell all those things came into these church ages but not here they didn't have to deal with them it when this when these first three ages came out they were a pure Church they had a school they had the Word of God amen so Satan comes out and he he says life I kind of like this I'm gonna ride with him cuz remember he's anointed two more anointed than most of us hello so he gets on what a power the people and he begins to ride so now let's read the first one because I want you to remember too though you've got to show this opposition that Satan is riding in up here but keeping the back your mind there is a real church God's got a real group of people on the earth and he is presenting the plan of redemption and then this whole thing is Redemption Redemption Redemption brother Branson don't ever forget that word Redemption and then because the feast seals are going to redeem us to the apex to the height of Christianity it's not gonna be because Satan did it but it will be that we know his plan we know his mystery the mystery of iniquity 1961 look see what it's doing it's these seals opening up just begin to reveal the plan of the devil know I read that wrong I'm sorry just begin to reveal the plan of redemption how he did it right the total plan of redemption was the Thunder that was underneath this seal under seal number two under seal number three under sealing them before I'm the seal number five number seven number six number seven was the mystery of our Redemption so there so just about finishing that look it's all over now just about finish that worth the end time now we are that was 1961 look how close we are yeah we're 45 5060 years from that hey man so we're at the end time so that's why the things are being revealed the property got told I read it to you they're in the SEM and the sixth seal he says you're not getting it it's not for you now he's talking to them I'm not talking to you the day huh it is for us but he was looking down at 6l he said it's not even for you I'll read it again if you want me to but look in the sink sale he says right at the first probably right first 30 minutes of his sermon he said it's not even for you it's not even for you that's tough but see I can't say that today so this for us I'm talking to you know why it wasn't for them cuz I wasn't sitting in the congregation you wasn't sitting in the congregation you wasn't sending the congregation most do you weren't even born Lewis you weren't even born 1963 hey man that's what he was saying it's not for you it's for us coulda took sixty years to what quit worried about this and start worrying about this and then the thunders I want to hear the voice of God that's what the city that's what the thunders are there the voice of God when the seal breaks and I'm gonna say to you because that's an individual fair with God listen what you know what I do believe the seals are not broke if you say that they're not Amen somebody walked up to me and said I don't believe the seals broke I said okay now if they ask me they're gonna get a different answer cuz I say they're broke I say God's thundering now for 60 years he's been thundering through a group of Ministers live people hey man listen we play we match play all we want to but somebody's gonna have to look you in the eye and tell you what that prophet said it's not gonna bad tape recorders not gonna take me in the rapture hey man just wanted to touch on that a minute line ox man an eagle the holy ghost through the church agent now we've come to the First Church the first three Church ages in the first seal but we know that least that underneath those seals there is a plan of redemption that man has never looked into remember the prophet of God he whipped the top off of the white pyramid right took the cap off look down in there now look it wasn't stuff stuffed down in there did he didn't understand him say I look down there and it was written in a different language not at that moment not that time he looked down and he said white had never shown on this before so I learned a new Bible what a new revelation had come out of the Bible amen it was what was written in the Bible with light shining on it and then that's what we're sitting under right now we're not sitting in the manifestation of signs wonders and healing that comes with it that comes with it but I'm gonna tell you just like I told Clark last night we were talking on the phone pray for him and pray for ginger she had her Hitler play and she's having muscle cramps and boy without her I would say that hurts if you've had a hip replacement and your muscle started cramping so keep them in your prayers brother Claude has been a nurse and you don't have that anymore I hope he ain't watching this but anyway but just pray for him I told brother Claude and I've told him many times before you just wait Satan is not in the Baptist he's here he's trying to divide and conquer the bride of Jesus Christ so he's going to send Satan Superman riding our door no I'm not saying this door in the door of what we call the message you know what if he raises up a man that has so much signs and wonders and they all come to pass but he preaches you to Lord preach is just seventh under verse you Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan he's only got to be off one word hey man one word is all he's got to be off and those signs and wonders to me would be nothing but you watch they're going to migrate to that person you wait and see because Satan Superman's coming here I'm sorry he got here for you did today he set his clock two hours ahead I came to look over and see him sitting beside you but I don't want anybody's feelings I no way it's okay but that's true we can't and that's why the seal was broke to show that sure yeah that Satan said Satan he's riding off but he was here at one time if he rode away from the Prophet he must have been pretty close when he started riding so I said he was real close in this church age when he started riding if this is all God's here's where Satan rode he rode right through the middle Evan you know what he's gonna ride all the way yeah brother Brown said he gets off the horse the horse keeps riding the horse keeps riding and I think I'll prove it to you next thing or Sunday afternoon so they got a little something there but anyway this is now I'm gonna go you're finished with this mystery of iniquity second Thessalonians 2 verse 7 says for the mystery of iniquity doth already work now let's just our solonian just already work only he now see it took a divine revealer of the word it took a prophet of God to tell us who that he was not only he God who now letteth will let he's letting this happen why is he letting this happen he's a just God and to be a just God he's got to give a choice amen for he now sorry one more time only he who now letteth will let until he now the prophet of God said that's us the bride be taken out of the way and that's true why because if when we're taking out of the way guess what happens right here we got the man standing here hey man we got the man which is called the Pope whenever you won't call him he's not a full manifestation until we leave and when we leave he's going to come in power amen because what's going to happen he's gonna incarnate the Pope you know why he's gonna incarnate the Pope remember he's a copycat Regina he has it God hasn't fully incarnated us yet we still got diverse talk about memories and conscious memories and conscious facts imagination that's where Satan does all this work we would talk about this other day but we're not fully retained okay but when we're fully redeemed God comes and incarnates a church a bride and then we take a body change and we walk over in another dimension Satan goes so that's how they do it hmm so that's how they do it I think now I go over there and I can get in that Pope memories a copycat he's gonna copy when God incarnates us and we leave he's gone Satan is gonna incarnate the Pope they been and he's gonna be the Beast to do his work but that's we're done we we got to get back here to the get back here to the first seal proverbs 16:6 is by mercy and truth iniquity is purged because remember they asked brother Branham said was the was second Thessalonians remember in the questions and answers on the seals it says brother Branham is second Thessalonians 2:7 the man of sin the breaking of the first seal he says yes okay so now how is he going to be destroyed proverbs 16:6 is by mercy and truth iniquity is purged amen when you purge the line something's in that line but you got to purge it you got to get it out Amen because remember we were born in sin shaping the iniquity alright and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil all right so let's go to the next one and we looked up the word justification which as we were talking about before and we hit something the Bible study though tonight is you've got your holy holy I mean you got you out of court you got an inner court that's attached to the Holy of Holies and right here I'm just gonna make a big dot and I'm sorry it's black but that's the Holy of Holies that's where God is so you go through justification hello brother Dale see this is why I had to wait till he caught up I guess our God was waiting so that we can all be on the same page now he went through all that baby form justification sins chopped off right now he's got us right here at faith where we are now that to me this is this is that holy of holies that's what you're born again that's your faith that priest had to have so much faith and God said put on this put this color on put this on walk this way and if he did every bit of that he had faith that God wouldn't kill him when he walked in that holy of holies a man all right and when he walked in there the Shekinah glory came down and the whole nation was justified for a year talk about justification the whole nation was justified for a year but then that priest had to come out but in Old Testament he came out under blood of bulls and goats that look Richard I'm gonna grab this one put it back the blood of bulls and goats just covered what they were doing they were still under here doing the little sin right but when we go in that Holy of Holies now under the blood of Jesus Christ it wipes away it doesn't just justify us for a year hallelujah it justifies us for an eternity how strong is that blood but we don't stay in here we come out amen and in the statue of a perfect man we're going to walk right back through there again with what brother Dale is doing in this on Sunday morning so it's not it's not a justification that chopped off your past sins at this stage it's a justification to show that your being what being born again that God is moving stuff out of the way because look you got to remember if you're born again in your soul you're just as eternal as God is and if you pass away I hate the word die you know what you died in Christ the day you got the new birth hey man the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first no the dead in Christ that died before they fell asleep my brothers and sisters went home they're more alive now than they were I'm gonna tell you something folks I'm gonna put this in real quick I was sitting there's a guy on my mail route that he has a one of those you pick it places you know he has some muscadine Scuppernong blueberries strawberries blah blah blah and you just walk in and pick what you do and then walk out well he told me a couple years ago he wanted me to put some bees out there so I went yesterday for yesterday Friday was off and so I put five beehives out their new house and we were sitting there talking and he's just a really good guy nominal Christian he was sitting there weeping at what we were talking about and you know what he was telling me he says I know that my whatever it was aunt or uncle he's over in the place you know what he said that really struck me he said why wouldn't we want her to come back here well I would I'm talking about a nominal guy this is not about his believer he said she's that he said you know what he said God can't make her think bad thoughts over there I never thought about that when Gary Adkins went across the curtain of time he didn't he doesn't spend his days worrying what Rebecca's doing hey man why would you that's a place of bliss sure we know that we're gonna connect back but man what a revelation from a guy that we think well he don't go to Mexico so we got a revelation please you might have more than that staying here today but it was weeping he said she's not worried about my uncle she's and I thought you know what we don't think about things like that but when they go across the curtain of time they're not looking back going well I wished I was back there now my brother Brent went across the curtain time he didn't want to come back here so the former things he quoted me sketchy said the former things will pass away behold all things will be made new man so we might get a revelation everyone soif we listen to people he was just weeping sincere he said we'll see her one day he said she ain't hurt unless she was hurting before he I let him preach to me you know I'm a preacher but I shut my mouth listen for about an hour he did a good job all right so this justification we're talking about it's not this whether you go because look and hear to me and we gonna get nowhere and where I wanted to go but remember brother Branham said and I told you this is a wonderful revelation to me see the first seal broke to me you know what it told me I don't have to stand judgment I am justified in him and I don't have to stand the judgment so you can say the first seal revealed an across to you that's fine but it revealed to me that Jesus Christ so justified me till he took my soul cleaned it up and now the life of the very creator lives inside of me but now we're working towards something we can't do this don't stick your chest out and thank you something I'm something because God made me something I'm something because what he did because even in a type the whole of Israel Oh two or three million people depended on one old man to go back there not spill a speck of that blood to walk the way he's supposed to walk and to put that blood on the holy of holies and they were justified for a year but now that we went in the Holy of Holies we're not justified for a year those who he has justified somebody ain't not in the Bible okay alright so I'm quoting this in the Bible those who had testified he is already glorified but you know what I'm not satisfied with that because I'm still watch you stop I'm not glorified yet sorry I gotta get them go to work tomorrow some of you don't some of you a little more work fighting I am Barry I get them go to work tomorrow pay taxes and all those other things you know but in my soul I am redeemed completely but God is doesn't want you to stay that way he didn't want that he didn't want that priests to stay in there he didn't want me and you to stay in the holy holy no he broke the curtain back so that everybody sit so we come out into justification now what through the statue of a perfect man so he can burn out the trash if we're still alive if we're still breathing we've got a chance to make a body change amen those are already going on they're waiting on us you know why because that place is full of faith we just have it spotty kind of like the old timey self-service we just had it every once in a while but over there they have full Wi-Fi because they're redeemed but their dead bodies waiting on to come back because they're not fully complete and then God wants us listen God wants us to live in a flesh body actually he does well he's already got he's he's leave anyone now it's glorified we're just detached from ours because you know what because we weren't the head he was and still yes I correct you somebody the other day they said oh brother branham was a prophet I said no he was not he still is we think they miss going on lost everything we lost our mind no he's still a prophet he said how do you know Samuel when the wind wind or brought Samuel up she sure recognized even a property guard said he still had his robe on his a his prophet robe own brother Bram didn't come down here just to be a prophet and then be nothing else no the millions of people said if you hadn't have come right but who did he point us to cuz that's the man he wanted to see I don't say you didn't care for the millions of people no it wasn't it but hit 40 say I want to see Jesus where's Jesus where Jesus said I want to see Jesus actually he wanted to see he could see these people but he couldn't see Jesus he said where's Jesus I want to see him he's always a little higher he's in another dimension in that seventh dimension he's up there with a glorified body but we come back out now we're going through the court again through justification so it has to be a higher form and we see the even baby form justification has to be a God work because remember one thing Satan will never forgive or forget your sin and he's not gonna let you forget him right man but we as the bride of Jesus Christ must have faith that in our soul is no sin zero just like the Genesis 1:26 man can you swallow this one I'm gonna chew it up a little bit Eagles just like Jesus what was in Jesus's soul is in your soul if not I told you before we beat people about one God and we'll get into it maybe later but we're the biggest bunch of tunas you ever seen in your life there's Jesus enough Jesus and us Jesus enough I thought through one this was what the Prophet said when God and Adam and Eve were in the garden that was one person we're gonna fill that new city we're gonna fill that new city and then people on the outside gonna walk in and they're gonna go you look like Jesus you look like your daddy you look like Jesus and they what they may want to talk to you huh aren't we little messiahs aren't we the Prophet laid a lot of labels on us that I don't think we believe yet Messiah well I want to see them myself now you can turn it look young turn look now turn look at the guy sister beside you amen little Messiah turn around look cuz there you are only Crocs this world's gonna season me and you that's why we had to come out and that's why we have to display that if the seals open amen alright let's cut through some of this stuff here we know that Isaiah 53 says by my righteous servant he shall justify many so it has to be a god thing God even in your baby form justification if he/she says Lord forgive me of my sins it has to be God that forgives you your sins amen and you'll never have to Lord a mercy like I said before many times I Drive by a place that I might have done something wrong and I go Lord forgive me and he's going wait wait come back we bring them back up I don't think God can't do he can't bring your sins back up amen even a prophet the prophet of God told us he said a few facts God to forgive your sin put it under the seal up under the blood I can't see it you know why cuz it ain't there Amen it ain't there that's why we taint justification is just a real weak form of the new birth it's a god thing and then as we get higher to show justification that the real one inside of you never did it Amen that's what we're heading toward but let's look at one more characteristic we know all this that in Romans 3 verse 19 I was telling you the other day that you know brother Brown he tells us he said justification baby form justification is when God chops off your past sins now he couldn't just get that from the air he had to get a revelation it was already in the Bible roll it up roll it on up but we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set for it to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past probably God didn't just grab it out of the air and say well I've just chopped off your patient no you read the Bible through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier that's you mean of him which believeth in Jesus hey man let's go let's skip a bunch because we remember we read this and cross the mystery we read an invisible union talking about that your sins was dead put away absolutely out of the existence even in the mind of God that you stand perfect but I want you to get something here one I want to read a few things on one God if you'll give me maybe ten minutes okay one guard Exodus 20 verse 1 through 5 go to that one brothers it's after quote number five we're gonna skip through five there ya go Exodus 20 verse 1 through 5 cuz we got look as brother Dale says many times before brother Branham tells us that this when the seals when the commandments came down the seals came down so that was the seals to the Jews was the ten commandments the Ten Commandments to the Jews of the seals to us okay just like the six fold purpose Daniel six full purpose does what redeems the Jews the six seals finishes our Redemption you saw no seven no the prophet said six seals finishes Redemption because he is the seventh seal and if the seventh seal breaks so are you will get that later all right look God spoke all these words saying I'm the LORD thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage thou shalt have no other gods before me now look people this is in the Word of God the denominations read this every day every denomination and half of the denominations in this message you shall never keep me around long enough thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything now remember this is the first commandment right thou shalt not make any under the any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt now Bob bow down thyself to them nor serve them now look this got totally washed away in the church ages because they come up with sorry even maybe to like I said down a lot of people do to Lourdes I mean please people come on that's it - brother Brown said if you got - one has to be what Antichrist in Christ sorry thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God now here see visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me that all right same answer that's your first that's your first pick it up here well now let's go to Deuteronomy 6 verse 4 I get my paperwork down here I'm gonna fly through this because we'll cover it in a couple of Sunday's here o Israel the Lord our God is to hear o Israel the Lord our God is two Lords three Trinity one the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might that are first john 5:18 very familiar we know that whosoever is born of God sitteth not whoa what he didn't say born here mama that didn't say born here mama that says he is born of God that's why you need to be born again cause yo you know what Jesus was telling Nicodemus he said look Nicodemus my birth was right yours was wrong so you need a new one so Nicodemus being carnal he says okay I got a googol back and do it over again getting my mama's womb come back no Jesus said no he should have said Nicodemus you made to be born of God he that whosoever is born of God now look there's your new birth then it's not there's no sin in the soul but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself there's the keeper my brother branham preached my god than not after that or they evening after that preaching that message he preached the God of my life that was his guide he preached the guide in the morning and the guide in the afternoon but he the begotten of God keeping himself and that wicked one touches him not in the soul he touches you in other words in other way memory reason continentally and we know that we are of God now looking John how pounds that we know that we're of God and the whole world lieth in wickedness and we know that the Son of God has come and have given us an understanding that we may know him that is true not three and we are in him that is true even in His Son Jesus Christ you so all I join you're a Trinitarian there's son and son of God and Son Jesus same one because he proves it right here this is the true God and eternal life I got all rights amen alright first seal watch this we're gonna get through these and maybe I've only been going in an hour the first seal brother Hao told me the other days to slow down so I understand what you're saying I'm slowing down a little bit more today not and they said now here's the wild horse now this is the first deal and a wild horse is the power and a charger a charger and he said the man who sat on him that was the white horse this now look this is what he's saying that the man that said on him that other people are saying the white horse was the Holy Spirit that went forth in the early Asian conquered that age for the kingdom of God he had a bow in his hand which meant like Cupid he shot the arrows of love into the hearts of the people the love of God he conquered roll it on all the way now that sounds very good but it isn't true it isn't the truth right he come to bring the property God come to bring us the truth amen not pursue me no it was a straight pipeline from God does a man that's why I said before brother Brian if you'll know no one I'm saying no one can correct brother Brennan no one except God himself there's no man stands between if you say brother Rams wrong then you put yourself between guarding him and what are you talking about an antichrist again look now watch why it does mean righteous and we realize that white means righteous the teachers taught it that it was the Holy Spirit conquering in the first page but now watch if this is a revelation to the first seal because he's fixing to tell you this it's not that Antichrist was the one horse rider but because he got the revelation that Christ in the Holy Spirit is the same person and only in a different form so here Krantz stands Christ the lamb and there goes a white horse rider with a rider on it this time tells us what he said my revelation of it by the Holy Spirit is not that way my revelation by the Holy Spirit is Christ and the Holy Spirit is the self-same person only in a different form so here stands Christ the lamb we know he was the lamb he stands here with the books in his hand and there goes a white horse riders see so it wasn't the Holy Ghost now that's one of the mysteries of the last day let me give you some strong meat if that first seal hadn't opened to you you can't preach God what Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan you can't preach to lords you can't preach all these folks doctor you can't preach Father Son Holy Ghost is a Trinitarian doctrine but when that seal opens to you you can't when that seal opens you you see Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same person so what is the true revelation of the first seal Oh Brad the LORD thy God is what in Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same person now that's one of the mysteries of the last day of the Christ can be the three persons in one it's got three different perform people father son Holy Ghost being three gods as the Trinitarian tell us it is it's three extreme manifestations of the same person roll it up roll it up or you might call it three offices keep going and how could Christ be out there with a white horse conquering and standing here with a book in his hand it isn't so it's Christ notice now the Holy Spirit and the revelation and Christ the Holy Spirit is Christ in another form that's right notice it is a lamb that opened the book and the lamb is Christ and Christ is not seen any more from then on why he's in us the world will see me amore but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even in you [Applause] sorry they mean to holler but there's the Thunder yeah yeah that's the thunder right the Thunder is a revelation contained in the seal not on the seal not the seal not this part Lord Satan done stole my seal he don't run off thank you he's gone he must have shortened that uncle I came there he is he's hidden in the Bible ain't kidding he might get converted but look that was that was what came because of the revelation of that hey man so that's old news the mystery is now history and once that first seal opens ii had dope hey man ii had to open right third had to open fourth that one seal remember seven thunders under the voice under the first feeling never uttered again though those seven thunders boom boom boom a boom after that first seal open it opened it all the profit every day he said oh I've never worked in a room like this before Lord he's seen the sick healed the dead raised two hundred fifty thousand people give their life to Christ and in one week he's preaching the greatest revelation since Jesus Christ walked on the face of there then he walks up on the sixth seal and he said y'all not getting it amen sorry but that's what he said now let's read on the sixth seal that all right can we go just a few minutes more next one six seal now notice yeah now we're going to read let's drop them down no we'll read it then answer the anything's going to start to answer now and he want to compare it with the seals now watch the first seal is revelation 6 verse 1:32 never read six ones they're doing I saw when he'd open one of the seals and I heard it wasn't noisy thunder one of the beefs four beasts saying come and see I saw him beheld a white horse and he the selling amount of bow and the crown was given him and went forth conquering and to conquer who did we find this fellow was Antichrist amen Matthew 24 now four and five and Jesus answering said unto them take heed that no man deceive you watch what he said for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many listen they don't deny the name Jesus Christ they just slide him in as a second person of the Trinity that's what it is right there see it Antichrist there's your seal a man brother branham there's your seal but the revelation under that's what I want I want that one God revelation these fishing talk about right now hey man that's what I want I want to make sure that I have no other gods before me or behind me actually sin all right look here they open the seal and here he was just perfect now let's go the next one 1957 I will restore but they had to worship they had the worship of one true God now he's talked about the first Church agent in that little faction they set up in the program which maybe you historians know of making the Trinity three different gods they had one God to father with a long beard and I've seen this myself I seen the picture right at the Vatican I didn't see the Vatican but I saw the picture of the you know the father is the man with a cane like this the big long white beard I wouldn't want to go to a lockdown hey man when Jim backslidden went back to the Baptist Church one time she I said just one time we all know the story when the Lord saved my soul and brought me back to church the devil got in June and sent her out to the Baptist Church but it was it was a test and we both passed we both clashed hey man I plant for myself we both class that tail but she gave me a book one day they were it was they were going to do a series on experiencing God right and sure enough it man looked like he's about 150 years old like a Moses you know standing out like this with a long beard I don't want my guard to look like that my god looks like the gardener my man my god looks like the gardener that Mary Magdalene said what have you done with my Lord he looked 50 something years old he was changed back you think he's gonna be 150 NS be eighteen to twenty no my god is eighteen to twenty years old if you call it old any of that but look that's the anchor that brings us back he's not even gonna look like that you said all about it now wait a minute that's what he look before he died but if that would have came back in front of Mary Magdalene because remember she didn't know him at eighteen to twenty years old that's why it was a hard thing for those disciples to walk with that man and then see a young guy walk up the - from a mass did not see an old man they saw a young man that's why they didn't I and he was so hid but he was hid in his youth this is Jeanne smiling we're getting older you know at 18 to 20 year old sounds good again but not on this side we're gonna bring it here a man with a father with a lone beard I see the picture in the Vatican they had another one god the son with a younger man and a little bird flying like a dove called the Holy Ghost now they lost sight thereof the true picture of the one true God God is not three guards now we remember that didn't happen right in here that happened as the saying then it became a deed then a doctrine man but it was a saying even in these streets the white righteous church that was on the earth had some people inside of there going now that Jesus he just can't he talk to a father so they must been some way up you know a tangible person up there in earth in heaven talking to this one and then on the river they was a dove look that was a dove came down and that made the three you see what I mean that's the saying then they went to Nicaea and it became a deed then it became a doctrine cuz I'm will read it to you in the church ages in the Bible the deeds of the Nicolaitans is not something brother Branham came up with read revelations two and three before two Sundays from now hazel off site God is not three guards guards one God God has three offices the Trinity I want to get to this I'm sorry for being a little own the Father Son and Holy Ghost but it isn't three different gods if it is we're pagan but that never started in the early church they no different from that it started in the middle age and other words coming up to here this is your middle age coming up to here it started when the unity of brethren was broken the love now of course we people today we believe that there's three the Father Son Holy Ghost is the three persons of one true God history officers not three guards but that same listen now we think that was ridiculous in the Catholic Church but we brought it right on down boy than Pentecostal started sliding under the bench he told them right there has come right down here at Pentecost and tore yourself to pieces because remember in the Pentecostal doctrine there's oneness trinity all kind of different things not one this I'm talk about Jesus only one like your finger one Amen set up another organization instead of coming like brethren we're brotherly love them with unity the first one began to see that the three persons of the Godhead was in one person Christ Jesus he was the manifestation of God in flesh not another man alright now let's read you think boy you know real wait y'all talk about denominations and Trinities and all this stuff yeah everybody believe God brother Brown was the Prophet right God sent that man to speak to us what was in the mind of God not his own thought right not his own thought when he was preaching the doctrines that was had to be straightened out that was God talking to us now I'm gonna take your scripture Matthew 28:19 go you teach all nations baptizing them the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost how would you baptize in the name of the Father and the name of the son the name of logos that's not even written in the scripture and I want some man now this is 1959 you say the Blessed Holy Trinity find me the word Trinity anywhere in the pages of God's Bible it's a man-made scheme an old dirty Church rag wrapped around to take the place of the SAP line of God's Holy Spirit there's no such a thing there's no such a thing you find it and come to me you're duty-bound to do it as a Christian if you find it it's not in God's holy writing and the Father Son and Holy Ghost is hatched out of hell there's no such thing as three God's now believe in the Fatherhood of God I believe in the sonship of God I believe in the Holy Ghost dispensation to God but it's the same God in every dispensation not three gone number 10 let's go to number 10 and by all rights a man Revelation chapter 4 1961 this is 1961 now my precious brother I know this is the tape also and I don't get excited let me say this with godly love the hour has approached where I can't hold still on these things no more to close to the coming see trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus saith the Lord who look where it come from it comes from the Nicene Council when the Catholic Church became in rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the Bible and as far as three gods that's from hell now look not two people look look right there he caught somebody's fault he caught somebody thought now do you say then do you believe that all these people that Trinitarians are of Heil no sir no sir I don't either but now telling you though if you become that right if you become that and you accept that as your doctrine and you've been taught truth well he's not but one place for that I believe they are Christians but the hour is approaching right now brother where they are sincerely wrong and brother Brown said you know that guy said I'm brother Ram I'm sincere he said you can be sincerely wrong right hey man let's go to number 11 second seal he's recapping the first seal but notice how they swap horse rider and I didn't underline any of these so I'll just have to read them with everybody all right say man ma'am all right number 11 let's read the whole thing now notice how they swap horse rider now we just background just a little till we hit this seal he's heading into the second seal now notice the wild horse rider when he went out he serves in three stages the devil as I proved to you the other night is Anna Trinity just like God but it's the same devil all the time in three stages notice his stages in the first stage he come in the Holy Ghost fell what no wait a minute the Holy Ghost fell we're Pentecost right here when the church age start that's what started the Gentile church age the Holy Ghost fell right here right hey your sleep okay I'm not talking that when I get finished I'm tired but I can't right now okay bear with me bear with me just a minute notice his stages in the first stage you come in the Holy Ghost fell and people had everything in common and the Spirit of God was upon them and the apostles went from house to house breaking bread with the people and there was great signs and wonders wrought and then the first thing you know here's your Wyler's writer the first thing you know Satan began to cause a murmur yeah I believe there's one God but now might be another person in there you know who's he talking to hey man I saw doctors get started people right my brother Dale said though when you sit in the service I'm gonna tell you how the Holy Ghost works you sit in the service and you hear some big-name preacher and most of them is big name preachers when you hear big name preachers preach a false doctrine then something inside of you doesn't rejoice and jump out and run out when something inside of you is like a light switch it clicked and what you've been taught comes to your head and it's the truth hey man we've been sitting where 600 people got up and shouted about this guy preaching a certain doctrine about planting a natural seed and I like nasty stuff anyway there was a whole lot of people we just set there I wasn't gonna shout over nothing they shouted over a Trinity I'm not shouting over a false doctrine hey man I'm sorry you you'll learn one thing you stay in this church long enough we don't deal with false doctrine like most people do out the door cuz you know what false doctrine is what kept us here Satan began to cause a murmur to come up then after a while listen trust what's inside of you have you ever done something now they even out not like in the world but out doing something like your job or driving or something something go don't go that way don't do that right and I start talking to you just like you sitting here today and something saying that's right that's not and then because remember truth were always ringed with truth amen but if a trumpet brings an uncertain sound oh then after a while look these slaves and the poor of the land that received the Holy Ghost they went out in different places testifying they testified to their masters and after a while they began to come like army captains see the the people with a little authority and the different people the celebrity began to see the gallantry and the miracles and signs that these men done so they accepted Christianity well then you see when he embraced Christianity he goes there to a place where they're meeting in a little dark dingy hall clapping their hands shouting speaking in tongues getting messages why he could never take that back to his competitor or whatever it is in his business he'd never believe it like that certainly not so he's got to dress it up Satan attached itself to Christianity hey man so they began to get together and began to think now we'll form something a little different that's what a denomination means is a division a common what denominator now we'll form something a little different Jesus right immediately at the first church age he told them in the second chapter I have somewhat against you because these deeds of the Nicolaitans Nikko conquered the laity Nikko means conquer Lathan's is the lifting in other words they want to make instead of everybody be one they want to make some holy fellow they want to make some kind of they wanted to pattern it into paganism from where they had come out from and they finally done it now watch first nickel Alton the nickel anthem was called in the Bible Antichrist because it was against the original doctrine of Christ and the Apostles all right I know only once at the end time listen to this one now see this is a revelation under the seal that there's one true and living God and there is no compromise we've compromised down through the church agent there's no more compromised notice here's something real quick now we'll end up with our tall notice revelation 16:13 2:14 if you want to put that down I don't have time maybe to go into it and want you to be sure and see it now notice this is the sounding between the 6th and 7th file now we'll close out just in a minute now it's not 6 & 7 steel now watch what he remember he'll put it in line now we'll close out just in a minute if you can just bear few more minutes longer thank you closing out now notice revelation 16:13 I've got the prophets message said I'm going for a few more minutes okay between the sixth and seventh vial three unclean spirits we forget about that those three unclean spirits did you notice that went out of the mouth of someone now notice quickly you ready say man congregation says a trinity of spirit now denominational brother set still just a minute now this isn't only one this is 1965 now denominational brother set still just a minute don't get up and walk out of the room back out there on this radio telephone hookup don't turn your tape recorder off sit still a man listen you're born of God you will a Trinity of frogs a frog is an animal that always looks backwards he never looks where he's going he looks where he's come from see don't you see where was trinitarianism born at remember three unclean spirits individual spirits are you getting it congregation says they may have noticed they look back to the night and council where the Trinity doctor was born out not in the Bible there's no such a thing they look back to the Nicene counsel at Nicaea rome where the trinity was born at notice where they come from notice the Trinity of frogs come out of an old Trinity give birth to the new Trinity their mother what it come out of a Trinity the Dragons see the beast and the false prophet see that Trinity started as a saying they couldn't put it together they were just making statements then they got it together like brother L says you read you're not seeing the first 19 Council was not that whether Jesus was God they were talking about it but 300 years later they come up with Jesus being a separate identity from God and then if I would have stopped it it wouldn't went no further but they didn't cuz that horse rider had to do what he was supposed to do he had to ride through there because remember this age right here either began or ended around 300 and something ad so the Nicean council sit so you see now what's happening we're going into the ox and the second seal okay which is a labor which is the the red horse amen and the Trinity of frogs came out of an old training because remember listen what killed them people what killed them people in that Dark Age their doctrine the Trinitarian doctrine kill them people literally kill them and brother brown said nothing untold billions with their doctrine you don't have to physically kill somebody now just preach them a false doctrine and let them believe it we stand in a horrible place here I mean here if we're not preaching the truth then we're taking you to another God amen a trinity the dragon see the beast and the false prophet the Trinity knew why is it new because it didn't stay in the Catholic Church the Methodists accepted it the Baptist's accepted it the printe cultures accepted it they man but it wasn't manifested until between the 6th and 7th file just before the seals open to reveal it amen that's another hole that's another whole subject let's go last one and we're done anointing one same actually it's the same quote started where this is false prophet singular false prophet the first pope and from there came out the and the mother of harlots remember the false prophet is singular it was one but the mother of harlots is plural amen it was one man but when he started letting loose his doctrine it became the mother of harlots Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Christian the whoring the mother of harlots the whole thing a false trinity was rising not in the early days wouldn't be made manifest in the early days it went right on through with it alright so he's still riding he's not got a whole lot of strength but he's fixing to gain more but he remember he's a bluff he's got a boat with no arrows he's a bluff he bluffed him into believing something they wasn't him in the Bible it went right on through it but when the seven seals become and opened those mysteries and reveal them that's when the frogs three unclean spirits like frogs came out to manifest itself because remember folks listen to what I'm saying if that prophet hadn't come and lined us back up to the word where would we be Presbyterian Baptist Baptist Baptist nothing Pentecostal and we'd still be going blessed holy trinity blessed holy trinity and somebody that we're in the Catholic sister Oh Anna's not here but you'd be going pray me out of purgatory claim out of purgatory I'm praying Oh youyou look excusing the Catholic Church plate praying to who marry a woman that's not throwing off on you guys I'm telling you but a woman being God the mother of God you see that unclean spirit what he done they came out to manifest himself a Trinity doctrine against the truth so when the Prophet and God opened that first seal this is just me I don't have a quote for it's just me this is brother Wade L quote when that first still open Trinitarian doctrine went out the door it wasn't accepted by God no more I ain't saying they weren't because look even FF Bosworth the old oak tree he's a Trinitarian but he had faith in what part of the word he could see hey man all those listen brother Brian was preaching to 90% trinitarian right and did they all come out no nois when he said on the six on the the questions and answers on the Silph he said go on as you are right don't try to twist this thing up cuz it's not for you but people it's for us we can if Paul was sitting here today he would not be asleep if I rainiest was here he would not be asleep you say oh poor old Columbo he just barely got through the age poor Oh Luther he's sitting a beer and sitting a pub and drink beer and smoke the pipe and talked about God you know what that was his time but if he was sitting around here today you couldn't you couldn't keep him in that seat he says so that's what that justification did for me I only saw about that much of it ball you broke a whole world open now see where did it come from see where it's going back to ecumenical council because that's what happened here it was an ecumenical council and what's it gonna end up as an ecumenical council but what they're gonna do then sorry what they did then was is they had a pope with successions and they thought this and they had to babish and they had this but listen now this ecumenical council now he's gonna put everybody together with one guy that's the danger but it's not danger to me in here because we're not going to see it right we're not gonna see the Antichrist incarnate the Pope will be gone but we're seeing the effects of it we're seeing these horses continue to ride even in this message they can't get one dog right they're all brothers anyway same spirits same thing and watch so deceiving musicians come so deceiving performing miracles that's why I just had performing miracles and these are Devils that go forth to all the gods of the earth working miracles to deceive them in the last day and we'll succeed in doing it but not to the true church not to the true bride we are sealed away from that like I said before keep this thing out of the way put that back in there for other reasons thank you we're gonna sit and watch this happen folks but we're not gonna be participating in it right we're not gonna be participating in it but we're gonna watch this happen but you know what we're gonna watch we're gonna watch with a full revelation we're gonna watch with the fullness of God like never had been before because remember Satan never never he tempted Jesus service is not over yet he tempted Jesus amen but Jesus never succumbed any of that right that's same spirits in you hello that same spirits in you that's what you get to overcome with that's what we're gonna talk about in a couple of Sunday's I'm gonna go one more time on the first seal but the first seal to me shows the true revelation of one God where the Trinity came from where this demon was and where he's going but also like I said Bible study the seals to me is very simple it tells me where I come from what I'm doing here and where I'm going and you know what it's not going to change he's the same yesterday today forever let's stand stand our fee god bless you sorry went you sang too long I'll sing along now please there you go right ahead sing number 98 in the spiral book our Lord's return let's worship just for a minute I am watching for the calming of that gland the lady all
