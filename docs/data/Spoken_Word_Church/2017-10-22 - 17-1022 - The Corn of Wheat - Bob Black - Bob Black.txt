========================================

all right so I'm gonna look at this little topic of the corner of week and I I just pray the Lord help me cuz I've got a list of slides to go through the week 3 well I want to slow down and take my time I think everybody can get a good handle on what you talking uh so anyway I want to talk about this little topic and the reason this is this you don't have enough is nothing you don't have you microphone oh well this table some errors no you're fine no there's no no there no you just lucky over there but you got to put the microphone on you don't have the microphone oh that right there right over here meet this on video I got the very first look when this man this thing is everything all right let me tell let me get my mind back on what we talked the corner we and and am I able to do it take out that first little section these good is that and now so the reason the corner wind is important is because you know [Music] there's a there's an alpha L Omega word and what's what is that in the last day without eyes grow in the church - yes he's growing us back to what was planted in the beginning and so that's why it's important to have an understanding of what that original corn of wheat looked like what its attributes and what is makeup and all the things about it word because the bride is I believe is now coming to a revelation of who she is and what has been taken place all down to the cemetery and the process of maturing so that the original word is made manifest back in the bride free back into the wheat land again so that it looks exactly like it did in the beginning not one word off that's kind of a big a big statement not one word off and I because because you know that's really what what started the whole problem in the beginning was Satan injected esteem you know to keep God's plan and purpose from being made manifest he injected it to one just one word off and all it took to stop the plaintiff to come block up the flus and unsafe Tetra to block up the flus and that's what's keeping God's Word from being made manifest in our life today he is a Satan wore injectable scheme to keep you from believing the full Word of God he'll inject doctrines you and Jake ideas in your head so that you say well I know I believe it but it it's not for me it's not this this is not something that I can take ahold of and he'll inject all these things to keep his word from being made manifest in your life and what's really interesting is even even when that juror maybe you can see that this is something I got off of like a nature website where they're talking about the developmental stages of a week early even when that week kernel begins to grow only in the shook their stages of maturity that has to come through look at look at what these things are the water stays the milk stage milk to ripen from milk and desire the sincere milk of the word all the way to where it's right and it's dead to itself it's ready to produce something you know when this isn't just like like we'll say let's let's go to the Bible types not just the letter on the page the letter of the just just like a unclick and word this is something that if you put it in the ground it will produce again it's got life in it so that's kind of what I'm gonna be talking about today is that when when God annoys the word it will produce something it's gotta be the words gotta be preached it has got to be delivered you gotta have the truth but then you also have to have the spirit with it because you can have you can have one without the other you can have the letter the intellectual letter yeah and not quick and then you just have it in your head and you just start thinking your biggest shot and you become somebody big and everything you can also have just the spirit without the letter and it's fall in it there's nothing there for it to quicken and so you have you know you can maybe cast out Devils and things and and and speak in tongues but the word is not there but if you get them both together then the anointed word will produce exactly what it's supposed to do Amen so I I kind of just been meditating on how important it is to get the word out there to preach the word and you know sometimes like I start you know thinking about things people that I've talked to things that I've heard and you know it you know brother out there's a quote where he said ministers are critical because that's the way that they are they're looking at the situation and it almost makes them more critical than other people because you see things in the church and the people and around and so I you know the Bible says confess your faults one to another and I pray that I'm not getting too critical because I now I want you want to have the right attitude to her but on the other hand you know I somebody was telling me that they heard a minister is saying behind the closed doors that that he believed that the correct way of this the seals and so forth but yet he wouldn't preach it he would just get out from behind the pulpit and just say well and another one in another situation that the minister would get out and saying I can't explain it as well as brother branham so I'll just play a tape now come on now we got ya don't work it's got a man freeze to get out that if somebody's gotta deliver it and so up just looking at some of these quotes like we're program said the father the father the hour has come what you say and knowing that we're standing your presence some day to give an account for our words even to our thoughts because that's how important it is to not just just come up and and say our own thoughts and our ideas but to lay the word out there so that somebody can grab a hold together because one day we're gonna have to give an account for the words that we speak in the life that we live that's that's how strongly I believe in the correct preaching of the gospel because every Minister I believe is gonna have to give an account did you preach what the messenger for your age Christ and he's gonna have to they count did you preach what Paul preached because they all goes back to the original and if you don't preach the gospel world see how you know James and and James chapter 3 he said it don't be many masters because it's it's kind of hard and then James the next verse he says it he's kind of hard for us to even in normal conversation to get on your word string it's easy to kind of miss things up so don't be desiring to to just give it up behind the pulpit and preach make sure that you got everything in order because it's a it's a dangerous place to get up and lay the word out to the people I mean I think I think of all the times that I looked at back in my life and it heard the word preached in a way that became a stumbling block to me and ministers actually put a stop up your food when they're supposed to be lifting the veil from your eyes but yet they put something obstacle in your way that prevents you from from really taking a hold of the word and grasping and you have to work around this brother I believe in the message presuming he said July July 8th he's talking about how when he thinks about when he's preaching he says did I like our favorite thing I'm just as clear as I've known how to lay it the Lord and I follow your instructions did I say one thing contrary to your word that I keep did i keep every word right on your word because these same people will stand with me in the judgment and I'll have to give an account for what I was saying while I was at this certain place where it is and there's that quote from James where he said be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation because if you get up but you got to live it not just speak it but it's got to be quicker to you also and for me and many things we offend all if me if any man offend not in words was the perfect man and they've also to bridle the whole body and I've said that not to be nothing to be critical but to lay out how important it is the preaching of the gospel unity and then here to the word because the word is what has to be sold so that it can come so that it can mimic begin to grow it's got to be sold it's got to be mixed with the anointing of the Spirit and then it will produce and maybe that will some of these labor slides up you know you look on Facebook and some of the things that people posting it and it begins to look like you know they believers almost question whether the word God can be fulfilled in their life and so that's kind of what I'm getting at is when the word is quickened it will bring forth the problem is our flus are stopped up we can't grasp grab ahold of the word because of all the stuff that's been sold and I you know you for all the things that you've heard all the things that you've got confused about yeah but what the spirit does when it quickens the word is that it removes all confusion and aligns everything up it moves everything right into its correct alignment so that you can see what you're really supposed to be seeing is your own personal Redemption no I'm not a great big old theological book of things that are hard to grasp but anything but you're supposed to see God working in your life to take you out of the things of the world and what are you doing he's got that sharp two-edged sword and it's separating you from the world and lifting you up taking you from the world by the word because that's that's what the word does and it starts off at justification and sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost virtue Oh always until we are finally completely removed from world we go to meet him in the air and what does that mean your work okay so we're talking about the corn of wheat because that's what we're becoming right and to understand what we are we first have to know who he is right and that's what you know I kind of get a little bit critical when it's presented room who Jesus is because you gotta that's who our faith is based on this food who that maybe is lazily who is because if you don't know who he is then you don't know who died for you and you can have no faith in who you are to become that you're part of him last night look back in the word of the signature you're part of you so in first Corinthians 12:3 says it says wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the Spirit of God call us Jesus accursed and then no man can say that jesus is the lord of I the only ghost but will say no man called Jesus the Christ he said by the Holy Ghost no man can say that jesus is the Anointed One what does that mean then knowing beside except by the Holy Ghost you know but you can't you can't see Jesus in the correct way you can't place him correctly and see who he is and what he is except by the Holy Ghost and that is that is the new birth isn't it the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you you think that the threefold mystery because then oh the whole Bible unfolds because all the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's so high when program said that when he went believe was born again when the ceiling and he'll and the book became a new book beginning because the Holy Spirit began to put all the scripture in exactly the right place and the picture of who Jesus was to begin to unfold him and Jesus said to them in John 12 23 24 then the hour has come that the shuk son of man should be glorified I say to you accept the coin week fall in the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit well what kind of fruit is it going to bring if the corn wheat goes in the ground it's going to bring forth another corn wheat right that's the principle of life what goes in the ground is gonna bring forth what goes in the ground it's gonna come up now if you so if you so corruptible seed it's not gonna bring up incorruptible seed that's that's the principle of life and that's why it's so important to preach the the incorruptible Word of God to have it so it can be sown in our life because what you hear false teachers to bring the false births now it was programmed said now it was a paradox when God caused a woman to conceive it was a paradox that how God the eternal that feels all time and eternity could come down become one to a baby crying in a manger now what am I talking about you who was that corner with you it was God in flesh it was God Tabernacle himself in flesh now the corner we in this day's gonna have to be the same thing right oh my goodness that's such a hard thing to almost come over here because you can't comprehend that unless you have a revelation of God's Redemption working in your life otherwise it's just letters on the page this I want to tell you about you I mean you can't say if you're just repeating it like what what blood daily for the way that said about the seals and brother day or whatever then it's just repeating words but it would when the word quickens that and you see it coming to pass in your own life then you're speaking from an experience of not just from a theological interpretation but an experience of his word working in your life and performing what is saying it would do Jehovah a baby Jehovah God a baby crying in a manger over a pile of manure in the manger now who what who was did that baby Jehovah I'm a Jehovah was in that baby it ought to have been striking Jehovah a teenage boy playing Jehovah driving nails as a carpenter no I wasn't Jehovah until the River Jordan no now then you've got quotes fight because he said Jehovah was in that baby crying the main kind of thing you're you're a whole religious experience you're a whole new birth is based on knowing who that man was that man was God in flesh the corn of wheat and that corn wheat with God in flesh planets so that you could come into his image in a paradox he said how that heaven can't hold him earth is his first Oh hip that foot still heaven this is throwing it could bring the fullness of the Godhead bodily and embody it into a man oh and you can measure for hundreds and listen to this this is a strong quote when you can measure for hundreds of billions of miles into eons of time and never measure God get a little baby lying in a manger and contain the fullness of his Guardian bottling right oh that you you can't even fully comprehend no man can see the father only begotten son has declared him you can't you can't measure that without a little puny little minds you can't understand but yet all that was distilled down in that little baby the man who am i but yet will say well that was a quite God yeah until the River Jordan Jehovah a paradox that great God who sits back younger to control a hundred million Suns shining on planets who never began and never ended and would embody himself in a manured state that's a powerful for didn't and that don't say uh we believe the message and we believe all the prophets but everything that we do we really believe it do they understand that now that's what the corner wheat is now we either win the Bible we've got all these different tires shadows everything to help us understand and when when you get the patters begin to lay out then you see that everything's kind of repeated through scripture hmm and listen this is what that Genesis 1:26 man was this is what that Genesis 3 man was that that was promised today he would bruise the head of the serpent this is that man that came down that was then we could not understand but it was put off into that little baby lying in a manger a perfect man and what why this is what God is bringing us truth to through the three-stage process of redemption where first he redeems he fulfills the redemption of your soul and then he blasts out all the flus by the opening of the word so that to get your spirit lined up so that the soul can work at work correctly so the word can be released in your life and you could be a benefit to others and the blessing to others and you can believe God correctly and then he caps it all off with a with a message of redemption that came in this last day you know to redeem your body that's right and that's full redemption that takes you back to it to exactly the way that corn of wheat that was planted in the beginning thing that's it that's a lot of stuff in it that's a lot of her tonight that's what the message is the message is all about the message was they get brother Brown of the cake that God sent program to deliver was not so much to teach us how to be born again yeah because that wasn't all through the seven churches people were being born again right sure and they're being born again by the opening of the word his name that the word was open to them in their day and they believed it and it was their birth to them but in this day something extra had to be given to give us a condition where we can escape the bonds of this earth completely entirely and going to meet him in the air and that's what this is the coral reef is a perfect maintenance so so we talked about that three-stage process that God redeems your your soul he gives you the new birth but then he starts unstopping your fluids and you know what the flu is is is what you think about Christ and what you do is if we just do it like that is what your your your memories and consciousness affection imagination all those five things are what you think about Christ because you think when when you get the number of God puts his faith Galatians 2:20 in your soul and I knew billions believe me or do you beget you've got all this stuff stuff on everything up from the world from your daily walk people saying stuff to you I don't know I'm good enough always good and I got a blast out and so you come to church and a minister preaches something that just knocks you right there and and you go home when you get the you know get to calling out to God or whatever and and and God because you receive the word and God keeps quicker than the word and the more rewards you eat the more it just keeps blasting out and opening up the flus you know I put some pictures here of chimney flues because if you don't if you don't have your flue stopped up then the house will get all smoky and it won't work right you got smoke everywhere in the house and it's just the fire doesn't have a way of escape a way of release because of it know what the new birth is a new birth is the Holy Ghost and firing you that begins to Kindle something inside and to really let it work correctly to let it work right like a locomotive you got to get them flus on the stop the only thing that'll get the flus and stuff though is the revelation of Jesus Christ to receive the word to eat the word and let that word become an Onan in your life and it will bring to pass exactly what the word says it will and that's how you walk with your Christian life you you take the word and you lay it before God and say like David did the second samuel 7:25 i love that scripture where God came and told him the he laid out for David what he was gonna do with the tabernacle I'm gonna I'm gonna come and Tabernacle myself in this in this temple that you built for me and then after God had got the promise in all these things that David David lay down on his face and he said to God you promised these things to Israel and now let it come to pass so I believe that's how our approach to God should be based upon his word you bring him the word and say now let it come to pass in my life first you gotta have the word do you gotta have the word first you gotta have the truth first and then you also gotta have the spirit right let the spirit know that that's right and the spirit woman know what the word unless you you gotta open the door right now doors in the door you gotta open the door and let him come in and and it's really easy I want to show you a quarter million worth look what God said that or what I said that that God wants to heal you a thousand times and the same thing forgiven getting a new birth same thing for all these virtues he wants to see you molded in His image the problem is up that's not God the problem is us making ourselves available not letting the devil suck up all our time giving ourselves to him to read and study and and so his work can be made manifest in us so talking about flus things that people tell you that stop things up and this isn't this is one of them and somebody mentioned after I acted that last sermon I preached where I was talking about how honker burger can be turn into a week ranks in my city can I see that quote because if that's true then anybody can be saved sure you see how we get our flu stocked up somebody said something and then you begin to get in your mind well there's some people that can't be saved but that's not scriptural is it now we know that God had that he knew that we would want it and you saw what would happen and so he had us in his mind for beginning of the world to me always knew you would accept him and that's how he can predestinate we know all that but yet it's open its open if you have a free world sources accept it and here's the quote I had a long list of these places where brother Mel talks about a cop overture being turned into a week earlier and I was a cobbler but all sudden I become weak right now in God's mind we talked about a predestinated seed everything in God's mind he always knew you weren't so that that's that CD yeah way did that attribute that was waiting for you to receive that it can be paid on you and he knew you would receive it yes but you had to come down when you were born on this sort of door because you were born a sinner and lost everything and you had to come to that but the way is open to everybody right now see this we get all these blue that it's uh bothers me so much when people say I don't know if my kids can be saved no I don't know if there's anybody here that this believes that but hey you gotta get that flu blown out if you either there's something keeping your kids from being saved you lay that word God that and acts 2 chapter 2 work they said that promise is under you and all your children if as many as the Lord our God so like lay mad at Jesus feet I tried man and say you promised it now they're coming back in and we gotta get our fluids blown out so many things that keep us from really taking God either the word you know I don't care if you look around and say well I don't see nothing else happened to nobody else's life well I see you moving in my life and I and that's not like here about you know you can look at everybody else's life you can look at you know ministers you look at ministers or say well I don't see nothing happy to his life but that's not the point the word is supposed to make something happen in your home you got to see it from your friend yourself there might be something evident other people's lives that you're not aware of that's right but it's your own life point all the goods in word I want to be made in his rice it's not about everybody else it's not about pointing fingers so much it's about us being made in His image and I was a carver he made a weed out of me take a cover and turn it to week but no end of thought he you always were we sure you always were we to this drink of them sure but down in this life a man you had to come through a process see and of course if you get that straightened out and give you great faith in God always ever that I was gonna come I always predestinate and that that that does kind of make you special it makes you a special person because you're always wearing God's tall because he knew you wanted anything so he always had you in his thinking Emma and that doesn't make you special it is preached in the right way you're not special because God said these people are gonna be saving these people gonna be lost but you're special because God always knew that you would want and then now this is what this is what I saw on Facebook we talked about Facebook for a second I know that's some dangerous topic somebody somebody talking about something in their life going on and they said we won't so sort of be healed now the Lord's will is for you to be here or no want you to be walking around with things that impede your personal walk in life anybody the Lord the Lord wants you to be healed but the problem is our flus are stopped up that's right we started thinking oh maybe it would glorify the Lord more if if I was walking around in this sick condition that that's almost the same line of thought that it would be if if you would say well it would glorify the Lord it for me to be in seeing walking around and then he continually sang me over and over what he wants you to be human my problem is we don't believe that we know in the Bible where it says that everybody that came to him as he walked ashore Galilee but thank God in his presence here that no death could stand in his presence wherever he went if somebody was there he raised him up we know all the things that he said I'm the LORD thy God may he love thee but yet we got our flu stopped up well we can't quite grab ahold of that because we believe it's not that we don't believe that is for us now look at this quote he said he wants to heal you tonight a thousand times more than you want to be healed but you're afraid you go by how you feel because you've regarded that you've lived by your feelings that's your whole life has been wrapped in that how about that how many of us our whole life has been wrapped up and how do we feel we get up in that morning we don't feel good so we think while we're asleep if you move more we get up and it's hard to go to church because of the way we feel and our whole life is wrapped up in feelings how your relationships with people that person doesn't make me feel good this person doesn't make me feel good so I like being around about sometimes our minister will say something to you they won't make you feel good but that don't mean it's not good for you take that medicine that's your whole life has been wrapped in that but you must get away from that and act on God's Word not what you feel not what you see what God said and act on that and make a confession of that confess means to say the same thing like like David did in his prayer and second samuel 7:25 you promised it now let it come to pass because God wants to see his word may manifest in you now here's the here's the flu lung blocker right here can we really quote the scripture in the right way jesus said unto him if thou canst believe some of the some things are possible a little bit of things are possible all things are possible to him that believeth now that take us all into a body change and if you believe if you believe in the word quickly then all things are possible in the belief but then then there's that Court of the the man that Jesus came to to take for healing and he came to Jesus from healing and he said the father of that little child and he said lord I believe help thou mine unbelief now put that put that with the patterns that we've been studying you get born again and you begin really believing but yet there are some things that you quite paint quite grasp onto Lord I believe but help my unbelief that's why this chance your perfect man it says pray for a revelation it's because you believe you're a believer but yet there's still some blockage going on yes that God's got to unblock when all the flows are unblocked then you're you're getting close to a perfect man you're you're getting close to where the headstone can come down and if you're getting shaked up to where you're in the right condition to be to have that anointing fall upon your life so that you're moving in just just the same way as that corn of wheat did now not not that you are the fullness of the Godhead bodily but you are coming to a place where the word is molded and manifested in your life that you know where your place is and you understand what God is doing and you fit perfectly into the into the the whole body of Christ for your age that's where the statue of a perfect man is unstopping the flues the 2nd Peter 1:4 dang whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises and we know this scripture very well because it's already been told but it's good to kind of rehash things in it because you know there's there's always let's be honest there's always language behind so mothers need a little bit hey I'm the slowest one here and took me hey I need things to be rehashed over and over before I finally get it yeah just being honest now III need to move it extra he'll sometimes partakers of the divine nature and there's where you begin to believe but yet yeah there's there's more to come right let the word keep unfolding to block out unlock those flus because you believe but yeah there's something blocking it out so you can't let it out and then you hear more word and then you can give out virtue you got something to give to other people virtue and then you keep hearing the word and and and your understanding begins to your understanding of what take a lot under concepts understanding of who Jesus is and your place in his body that's knowledge real knowledge is knowledge above Jesus Christ answers an old up until until you're the flues are so unblocked that you can give up brother come to somebody hate your goods and yet you still can put your arms around them and love them and not just put your arms around the love but pray for that brother and call out to God on that brothers half because you so the who go back to the corner we who that corner baby is and the corner we is the unknown inferred and the anointed word is gonna bring to pass what it's supposed to be kids got to be anointed either go back to that that sermon this is one of my favorite sons be certain of God if you ever get a look down and get like brother Jules said while he was gonna listen to be certain of God because I that's one of the most unknown at sermons that brother Brenner priest when he lays out with that that the logic going down to the low the woman's air path and she made him that cake and ingredients of it tell you in very simple terms exactly how to be boring in the truck there's another reason for a preaching of the gospel so I I heard somebody from another church say I wish it my pastor would lay down exactly how to be born again I I don't know how to be boarded either and that that grieves me so bad and you know will maybe get it get all high and mighty in ourselves but I wonder if if we went around the room tonight tonight what everybody in this room would be able to explain how to be born yet and would you be able to do it sure yeah but not don't give up and teach you know how to be and if you don't you maybe start off with this sermon because this sermon will explain in very simple terms how to be born again you gotta take the ole and this and the spirit and truth like that don't let the well came to Jesus you said back well some worship over here somewhere sheep over there we don't know where quite where to worship and do you said whether and how it is it is now gonna come that they're worshippers gonna worship in spirit and in truth he later that spirit and truth you gotta have the truth and then you also gotta have the spirit right if you don't have the spirit then you just state election and the intellectual be like st. Augustine that just argued over the word and and thinks they understand the word and then starts like saying always they did killing the Christians because they didn't agree with his doctrine that's just intellectual but this a spirit-filled just an unadorned in one will have just the spirit on their life on their spirit but at the end their soul the word is not there's no word that they've received there's no word they've failed to quicken it but if you can get both together then they will produce something you know we talked about annoying ones that everything there's nothing wrong with we have been anointed I won't be anointed because program explain the difference between an anointing one is not the sign is a wonders both have the signs of wonders the only difference is the word and the word is one of the differences so I want an anointing in my life let's look look what my mom says here and the spirit mix with the truth has got to bring something ever put it together it makes a cake you see that's the recipe for being born you put those two together and it makes the cake and then you can live off that you can live off that cake we're not talking about a natural cake game we're talking about spiritual cake a supernatural cake the keeps keeps on moving and out of the letter by the spirit and if the word abides in you then you're anointed person with the word they talking about how Christ is the anointed work that's Christ and you and Nonie the word for this age whatever age they lived in a god a noise somebody sends it down and makes that word act just exactly the way he said it didn't to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then where are you going with this go along well where I want is I'm about to run out of time where I'm going is back to that corner week who isn't that Gordon week and I because you know the word Christ he was we call him Jesus Christ because Christ the Messiah is that known at one he was the anointed quarter it was annoying to you know the word for his day where when did he get an owner we know I kind of know when you're on the River Jordan but Christ means The Anointed that's right that logos that came out of God from beginning to the world came out from the Father what was already annoying didn't that Jehovah that little baby interlining he cradle that soul that was in him was already a known enemy but something happened at the River Jordan an anointing to push him to get him to quicken his life into the minister I happened at the river Joey but before then he already was anointed and that's how when you get the new birth the the word is anointed in your life to bring you into a birth begin to begin then you begin you keep eating the word and the word is anointed and it keeps pushing you all up into a higher place the word anointing the word and it will prove it will it will make manifest what the word says on letter form the Spirit is what makes it a little bit go back in Genesis when the Spirit of God began to woo over the earth and wooed over the word that was already soul in the earth the Spirit is what made that word come to life and just went to the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit not bad let me get my tongue untangled here and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and I got just like a little graphic here like a Leica and that great eagle spirit moving over the waters to bring the earth back into his right condition to get everything lined up again and that's that's what Christ the mystery God revealed is that's God is bringing the earth back into its evening light condition bringing the bride back into the condition of the groom and bringing everything into harmony with him guess what the spirit does the word has been spoken for the spirit will make it live and how does the spirit the spirit comes the journal of life is sold through the body it's got to come through the body by the preaching of the gospel by from your attitude of the word in it and that's what brings it oh I'm just gonna stop looky-looky going on I've got uh I got seen I got eighty slides and we're only able slide twin
