[14:33] you know we just commit ourselves to you
[14:34] tonight we thank you for all things in
[14:37] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[14:40] amen first second Corinthians chapter
[14:43] five
[14:45] very familiar scriptures
[14:47] says for we know that if our Earthly
[14:49] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[14:51] we have a building of God and house not
[14:53] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[14:55] for in this we groan earnestly Desiring
[14:58] to be closed upon with our house which
[15:00] is from Heaven if so be that being
[15:03] clothed we shall not be found naked for
[15:06] we
[15:07] that are in this Tabernacle do grown
[15:09] being burdened not for that which
[15:12] for that we would be unclothed but
[15:15] clothed upon that mortality might be
[15:17] swallowed up of life now he that hath
[15:19] brought us for the same self-sane thing
[15:23] as God who also hath given
[15:26] unto us the earnest of the spirit
[15:28] therefore we also we are also confident
[15:31] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[15:35] the body we are absent from the Lord for
[15:37] we walk by faith not by sight we are
[15:40] confident I say and willing rather to be
[15:43] absent from the body and to be present
[15:45] with the Lord
[15:46] and they didn't put that up there I'm
[15:48] sorry I forgot that I was just I got to
[15:50] reading and wasn't paying attention
[15:53] I know I only had one one three four up
[15:54] there let's go to First Corinthians
[16:00] very familiar scripture
[16:02] verse 13 says but I would not have you
[16:04] ignorant Brethren concerning which them
[16:06] are
[16:07] concerning them which are asleep that
[16:09] you saw or not even as others which have
[16:11] no hope for if we believe that Jesus
[16:13] died and rose again even so them
[16:16] also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
[16:19] with him for this we say unto you by the
[16:22] word of the Lord that we which are alive
[16:25] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[16:26] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[16:28] before the Lord himself shall descend
[16:30] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[16:32] of the Archangel and the Trump of God
[16:33] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[16:36] then we which are alive and remain shall
[16:38] be called up together with them in the
[16:40] clouds to meet the Lord
[16:41] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[16:43] the Lord wherefore Comfort one another
[16:46] with these words
[16:48] and then Romans 8 28 very familiar says
[16:52] for we know that all things work
[16:53] together for good to them that love God
[16:55] to them who are the called according to
[16:58] his purpose
[16:59] amen you may be seated
[17:05] and there's many things that
[17:07] in and are
[17:10] I was
[17:12] kind of continuing on from what we've
[17:14] been we were talking about
[17:16] earlier
[17:18] and to know
[17:20] you know Paul talks about to know for we
[17:22] know and we know
[17:25] and he also says it's important that I'd
[17:28] have you would not have you ignorant
[17:30] Brethren of these things and we know
[17:32] Paul talks about different places in the
[17:34] scripture and I just want to look at a
[17:36] few things tonight but
[17:39] you know there's there's many things
[17:40] that we can look at in the in the
[17:43] scripture
[17:44] from from the this uh rating
[17:48] and you know there's there's many things
[17:49] that people uh
[17:52] look at
[17:53] and you know when we look at these
[17:56] scriptures here
[17:58] you know
[18:00] we know from the beginning
[18:02] you know God had a had a plan and a
[18:05] purpose and you know
[18:07] God God made man in his own image
[18:10] and in his likeness and you know he had
[18:13] a he had a plan and a purpose that he
[18:15] wanted man to fulfill and
[18:17] you know the the
[18:20] you know
[18:22] the way God created man he put man on
[18:24] free moral agency and we know how God
[18:27] allowed man to do his own thing and do
[18:30] his own go his own way because that was
[18:33] part of God's plan
[18:34] for God to manifest all of his
[18:37] attributes because if you know if nobody
[18:39] was ever sick he couldn't be a Healer
[18:42] and if nobody ever got lost he couldn't
[18:44] he couldn't be a savior
[18:47] but we know how God had all these
[18:49] attributes that he wanted to be
[18:51] displayed and you know he set it up
[18:54] not that you know many people when you
[18:56] talk to him and you try to explain the
[18:59] the plan and the purpose of God you know
[19:01] it's either well God doesn't know
[19:03] anything or he knows so much but he
[19:06] doesn't know everything but you know
[19:08] because people say well the Lord knows
[19:10] all things he's like well do you really
[19:12] believe that
[19:13] because when you begin to express things
[19:16] because let me ask you a question about
[19:18] foreknowledge and predestination
[19:21] and then all of a sudden you get this
[19:23] pushback it's like well now did God know
[19:26] everything or he didn't know everything
[19:29] either he knew what he was doing ahead
[19:31] of time
[19:32] and he knew what you were going to do
[19:33] before you done it before he created the
[19:35] world
[19:37] when he was Elohim when he was
[19:38] self-existing when he was by himself he
[19:40] knew what was going to take place
[19:44] or he didn't
[19:47] then he would know
[19:50] that he's not forcing any one of us
[19:52] through a tube he's not dragging us
[19:55] kicking and screaming
[19:58] but he knew that if the word passed our
[20:00] way we'd receive it
[20:03] he made the word available to us
[20:07] so then God's not a respecter of person
[20:10] so the scripture is true where he said
[20:13] that God was willing that none should
[20:14] perish but that all might come to
[20:16] repentance
[20:17] so he made a way for everybody to come
[20:20] the problem is is people won't accept it
[20:24] you know many times when people people
[20:26] begin to look into in the Book of
[20:29] Genesis when it talks about Cain and
[20:31] Abel and you know many people stumble at
[20:33] even people in this message they stumble
[20:36] at that and it's like it's to me it's a
[20:38] very simple
[20:39] concept of the scripture God told uh
[20:44] Cain what to do
[20:47] he come by his own way come by his own
[20:50] thought
[20:51] by his by his intellectual thinking he's
[20:54] like well this is what God would like
[20:57] but that's not what God required that's
[20:59] not God's plan
[21:01] it required blood
[21:04] there had to be blood because it was
[21:06] blood that caused the fall it had to be
[21:08] blood to take it back
[21:10] so there had to be without the shedding
[21:12] of blood there's no remission of sins so
[21:14] there had to be blood that was shed
[21:17] and by Revelation Abel knew what
[21:20] sacrificed to offer
[21:23] but Kane didn't have that
[21:25] but Cain had the way presented to it
[21:30] the way was made for him
[21:33] because God told him said listen if you
[21:35] will do as your brother you don't even
[21:37] have to know what to how understand all
[21:41] this just do as your brother
[21:45] because see the the problem that Cain
[21:48] had Cain could not walk by faith
[21:51] because that's what it required it's not
[21:54] understanding it's by faith I'm going to
[21:56] take God at his word that's what faith
[21:58] is taking God at his word and doing what
[22:01] he said
[22:02] and so when Cain with he did not take
[22:04] God at his work
[22:06] and so he was like no I'm not going to
[22:08] do because I've made my choice make my
[22:11] decision this is what I'm going to do
[22:12] and God said listen he said either
[22:14] either you follow this or sin lies at
[22:18] the door
[22:19] and that was your choice and he made it
[22:22] and every person
[22:24] every one of us here
[22:27] throughout the whole world we've all had
[22:29] that choice
[22:30] somewhere along the way God has made the
[22:32] choice has made the opportunity we make
[22:34] our choice
[22:36] where we've heard the gospel once or
[22:38] we've heard it ten thousand times we
[22:40] make our choice
[22:41] and that's what too much to those who
[22:44] have been given little little is
[22:46] required but to those have been given
[22:47] much much is required so each one of us
[22:50] have to make our decision and we all
[22:52] have to go by the things that that we do
[22:56] and we have to pay the consequences of
[22:58] it
[22:59] but God God is gracious and when we do
[23:02] make a mistake
[23:04] there is a blood atonement to cover our
[23:08] sins
[23:09] and we can always go to the blood
[23:12] there's always a way made
[23:14] but we have to take that uh
[23:19] atonement we can't because he doesn't
[23:21] force that on us that's our that's our
[23:23] choice
[23:24] and just you know it's so gracious to
[23:26] think of of or of how God is with us
[23:29] that he has made a way for us and we
[23:31] have to receive this it's it's a
[23:33] wonderful thing but the world is not
[23:35] there's many people that will not accept
[23:37] it
[23:39] but that's that's their
[23:41] that's their loss that's the condition
[23:44] of the world is in but you know God God
[23:46] made man to to fulfill his plan and and
[23:49] you know the fall took place and and God
[23:52] made a way for them to come back in to
[23:55] Fellowship
[23:56] there was a way made and you know and he
[23:59] was wanting to bring him back into
[24:01] fellowship and you know to express his
[24:05] attributes and you know there was a way
[24:07] made that we can come back from where we
[24:10] came from
[24:11] if we came from God we have a purpose
[24:14] brother Brown said we're every part of
[24:16] the creation of God is here to fulfill
[24:18] their purpose everybody that was created
[24:21] all things were created that was created
[24:22] for a purpose
[24:24] and so everything has to fulfill its
[24:26] purpose and brother Branham said he said
[24:29] for every every part of the creation of
[24:31] God that fulfills its purpose he said it
[24:34] lives again
[24:35] because he said when you see that when
[24:37] job was speaking of the tree he said
[24:39] when you see the tree and it blossoms
[24:41] and and the leaves and all these things
[24:43] but then it comes in the and the leaves
[24:45] fall off and and the life leaves and
[24:47] everything looks so dead and dried up
[24:52] but he saw the life return
[24:54] the life came back on display
[24:58] why because it fulfilled its purpose
[25:01] through the through the spring through
[25:03] the summer
[25:04] through the fall
[25:07] but there was another spring coming
[25:10] and when he saw it when job saw a man
[25:12] he's like man gives up The Ghost and he
[25:15] goes in the ground but will man live
[25:17] again
[25:19] but you know God began to speak to job
[25:21] and tell him
[25:22] and show him give him a revelation
[25:25] so as as we know here in the scripture
[25:28] that God had had man and he give him
[25:31] away back
[25:33] to
[25:34] to him back to the place where he came
[25:37] from
[25:38] that's what and that's that's our
[25:39] opportunity today the same thing
[25:41] if we come from God we're going back to
[25:43] God
[25:44] there's a way made for us to go back
[25:48] and you know the scripture says that you
[25:51] know man was put down here on the earth
[25:53] and you know we just we're just here for
[25:55] a short period of time and
[25:57] you know we realize that as as I believe
[26:00] it was brother Dutch you know it was
[26:02] taken of you know we're only we're just
[26:04] Spiritual Beings here for in a human
[26:06] experience a human time here but then
[26:09] we're going back to where we came from
[26:11] you know we're just here for this
[26:13] portion of time but we got to go back
[26:15] and we've got to make that decision of
[26:17] which way we want to go because if we're
[26:19] a part of God then we go back to God
[26:21] and I thank God he's made the way but
[26:23] you know so when he made this way that
[26:25] we're only here for a period of time and
[26:27] then and then time is over with and you
[26:30] know we're only here for this period of
[26:32] time that that while we're here where we
[26:35] are to prepare ourselves because this is
[26:38] just the window dressing this is just
[26:40] the rehearsal it's just going to soon
[26:42] pass away
[26:43] but you know because we we can get so
[26:46] tied down to the world and and the
[26:48] things that we have to deal with day to
[26:50] day and not realize there's a greater
[26:52] thing waiting on us than this you know
[26:54] many times we we just see we just see
[26:57] these three dimensions and we're Bound
[26:58] by these three dimensions and and many
[27:00] times we fail to see the greater things
[27:03] that are coming you know because you
[27:05] know that's what I'm waiting on I'm
[27:07] looking forward because there's coming a
[27:08] day when when all this will pass away
[27:10] and you know we don't know we don't know
[27:13] when our time's going to be up but we're
[27:15] promised that our time's going to be up
[27:17] you know we would you know there's
[27:18] there's no uh expiration date stepped on
[27:21] anybody's foot so you don't know
[27:25] but God knows God knows when our time
[27:28] will be up and it'll be and you know God
[27:30] and and His Infinite Wisdom not not for
[27:33] us to figure these things out we just
[27:35] know it's a fact that you know as
[27:37] brother random said he said if we if we
[27:39] live through the night we'll outlive
[27:41] many 16 year olds
[27:44] we'll outlive many babies
[27:47] we don't know if we're going to wake up
[27:49] in the morning wait not we're not
[27:51] promised them all we're not promised the
[27:53] rest of the night
[27:55] but now is the day of salvation now is
[27:57] the time to prepare to get ready
[28:01] and now is the time for us to make sure
[28:04] that we are ready to go because
[28:05] everything else is is is insignificant
[28:09] because all this will pass away
[28:12] but there's only one thing because what
[28:14] what part of God the word of God what
[28:17] you take of the word what the having the
[28:19] life of God inside of you that's the
[28:21] only thing that counts what is eternal
[28:23] is the only thing that's important the
[28:25] rest of it will pass away
[28:28] so you know as as we begin to look here
[28:30] in the scripture and you know when we
[28:32] see that God Made A Way and and and so
[28:35] when God made this made a way for us to
[28:38] come that that God can take up residence
[28:40] in us that we come alienated from the
[28:43] life of God lost doomed on our way to
[28:46] hell but he made a way for us to come
[28:48] back and not just away but he came to
[28:50] live inside of us
[28:52] he come to take up residence inside of
[28:55] us he come to live inside of us that we
[28:58] that we it's not us living anymore it's
[29:01] no longer Aaron Roberts living but it's
[29:04] Christ Living in me
[29:06] that's what Paul said and and so it's
[29:08] not as Paul said it's no longer I that
[29:10] live now and it's and it's chose to be
[29:13] our testimony each one of us should have
[29:15] that same testimony it's no longer that
[29:18] that it's me but it's Christ Living in
[29:21] me
[29:22] and you know when we see the things that
[29:24] the the pressures and the problems that
[29:26] come to us but you know when God come to
[29:28] take to come up take up residence in us
[29:31] to live in us then God wants to display
[29:34] himself that we fulfill his portion his
[29:37] plan for our lives is to make sure that
[29:41] we the world gets to see who who God is
[29:44] because you know the the you know you
[29:47] can argue you can argue Theology and
[29:50] many things like that but you can't
[29:51] argue with a life
[29:54] and you know and so when when the when
[29:57] the things come our way and we have
[29:59] problems and and and issues and things
[30:01] you know when when these things come
[30:04] when we realize when these things take
[30:06] place that God has has a plan for us a
[30:09] purpose and he wants to make us known
[30:14] you know if if you I was listening to a
[30:17] man the other day and and he was talking
[30:19] about he said you know if you take if
[30:21] you take an orange and you squeeze that
[30:24] orange he said what did you get
[30:28] what do you what do you get when you
[30:29] squeeze an orange
[30:31] juice you know what none of y'all said
[30:34] juice
[30:36] you said orange juice why because when
[30:39] you squeeze an orange you don't get
[30:42] anything else but orange juice
[30:46] and brothers and sisters when God is on
[30:49] the inside when God has taken up
[30:52] resonance and we wonder why we Face
[30:54] problems and heartaches and troubles and
[30:56] trials well when the squeeze comes on
[30:59] then you know what it's really bad if
[31:02] you claim to be a believer if we claim
[31:04] to be children of God and when the
[31:06] squeeze comes on when the trials and the
[31:08] troubles come and the heartaches come
[31:10] and the disappointments come and we can
[31:12] people get everything else but God
[31:15] when you squeeze a Christian then it
[31:18] should be christ-like we should see they
[31:21] should seek Jesus Christ on display
[31:23] that's what God wants in this life
[31:27] when these things come our way we we're
[31:29] not we're not ever promised a Bed of
[31:31] Roses but when these things hit us and
[31:33] they come our way then you know what
[31:35] it's for God to get the glory
[31:38] and so when these things happen they
[31:41] come for a reason
[31:45] and see many things come our way and we
[31:47] don't we don't understand why these
[31:49] things happen the way they do we don't
[31:51] understand all these things but you know
[31:53] what God is in control and God God knows
[31:56] what's going to take place long before
[31:58] we ever get here and have to go through
[32:01] these things and I'm so glad that we
[32:03] have somebody that can lead us all the
[32:06] way and knows the answer
[32:09] that I can put my confidence in
[32:13] you know there's many times we have
[32:15] heartaches and problems and I was and I
[32:19] was listening to brother Branham and
[32:21] you know certain things that just stand
[32:23] out to me and and you know you listen to
[32:25] things why things happen and
[32:28] here in the scripture and it says you
[32:30] know we're not to sorrow as others which
[32:32] have no hope
[32:34] you know we're all going to have
[32:36] problems and sorrows and heartaches and
[32:38] disappointments
[32:40] that's life's grab bag
[32:42] you know you just buckle up because
[32:44] they're coming
[32:46] but the scripture tells us not to sorrow
[32:49] as the others because they have no hope
[32:51] but brothers and sisters we have all the
[32:54] Hope in the world
[32:55] we got all the hope that passes all
[32:57] understanding
[33:03] and
[33:04] uh
[33:06] I just want to read a few things here
[33:10] uh
[33:11] I love this
[33:13] brother Branham
[33:15] um
[33:16] there's there's a there's a lady that
[33:19] that brother Branham talks about and you
[33:21] know when I get on the other side
[33:22] everybody says who do you want to meet
[33:23] and you know there's people that I will
[33:25] I want to meet and everybody says I want
[33:26] to meet brother Branham and I want to
[33:28] meet Paul and I want to meet this person
[33:30] and I want to meet that person I tell
[33:32] you some of the people I want to meet
[33:34] I want to meet I want to meet that black
[33:36] sister from Memphis
[33:37] that stopped a plane
[33:41] that grounded a plane and had and told
[33:44] us she prayed through that she knew the
[33:46] prophet was coming and brother Brandon
[33:48] didn't know where he was going but
[33:49] Sheena who he was when he come walking
[33:51] down the street praying
[33:53] singing
[33:55] then she said good morning Parson
[33:58] because she said I've been waiting on
[33:59] you all night long
[34:01] because the Lord spoke to me and told me
[34:03] to come stand beside this fence and I've
[34:05] been waiting on you
[34:07] now that's the kind of person I want to
[34:10] meet
[34:12] I tell people the per another person I
[34:14] want to meet in this world I want to
[34:16] meet Garnet Pete
[34:18] Pete I tell you what for a man that's 18
[34:19] years old to have that kind of effect on
[34:22] the profit I tell you what that's an
[34:24] amazing I I tell you what I would rather
[34:26] have a a testimony to be a a Christian
[34:30] that had that kind of faith
[34:33] had lived that kind of life and only
[34:35] lived to be 18 years old than to be a
[34:38] hundred and twenty years old and not
[34:40] have anything in my life and not have
[34:41] anything to show for it but I'd rather
[34:43] I'd just like just like brother Brandon
[34:45] said talking about Garnet say he came
[34:47] and he lived his life and he lived the
[34:49] part that he and you know he was saying
[34:50] you listen to brother Brown and you tell
[34:52] that that young man had an effect on him
[34:54] it touched him when he when he was
[34:56] giving his funeral and you listen to
[34:57] that it's like man if you're ever a
[34:59] teenager and you ever want to live a
[35:01] life you listen to what brother Garnet
[35:03] lived that's the kind of life you live
[35:04] that's the kind of testimony that you
[35:06] want to have that you can reach out you
[35:08] know that moves everybody
[35:10] hey
[35:12] because you know what we're not promised
[35:13] tomorrow we're not promised the next day
[35:17] you may not graduate from high school
[35:19] you may not ever get married you might
[35:21] ever do anything but you know what you
[35:22] can be a Christian you can show this
[35:24] world what a real true life of God is
[35:27] [Applause]
[35:32] and the other and this and this is the
[35:34] other sister that I that I I would love
[35:37] to meet and that's sister Bale
[35:39] and brother Brown talks about that he
[35:41] said you know she was a big sort of a
[35:43] heavy set black lady and brother Brown
[35:44] said he said always love to hear her
[35:46] course amens and you know and brother
[35:49] random was talking about she was the
[35:51] sister that brother random talks that
[35:53] tells the story about that he got the
[35:55] phone call and he thought it was a
[35:56] sister Shepard had a need and so they
[35:58] were praying over sister Shepherd and
[36:00] then brother Billy Paul calls him and
[36:01] says no it's not sister Shepherd it's
[36:03] sister bail sister Bell had a need and
[36:07] said well then he raced to the hospital
[36:08] to find her and when he got to the
[36:10] hospital sister Bale had already passed
[36:13] and brother Branham and you know when
[36:15] you hear these things and you know it
[36:18] just it stirs me so many times to hear
[36:20] that and you know he goes out there and
[36:22] you know he says you know she had this
[36:23] the gallbladder issue and all these
[36:25] things and he says he said but when we
[36:27] bring it to a full measure he said we
[36:30] have we say this God called for sister
[36:32] Baal and that's the way it had to be
[36:34] taken you see
[36:37] now why was it now when we look at the
[36:40] all the heartaches and the
[36:41] disappointments and all these things are
[36:43] happening off why was it that the
[36:45] message came to brother Branham that it
[36:47] was Sister Shepard and not sister Bale
[36:50] why was it that it came that it was her
[36:52] why did it go that way
[36:56] and it and brother Brown says well you
[36:58] know he was talking about
[37:00] and and when he gives when he gives the
[37:02] but he does her funeral and the message
[37:05] Expressions brother random covers that
[37:06] also and he says you know it he thought
[37:09] it was
[37:10] sister Shepard and he said it was Sister
[37:12] Bale and he said he said and to see that
[37:15] he said the wise Providence and plan of
[37:17] God
[37:18] before he could ever get their sister
[37:20] Baal had done climbed the golden stairs
[37:23] he said before I could get there God had
[37:25] plucked his rows of color to take his
[37:28] bouquet for the millennium
[37:30] before I could get there she was going
[37:32] to meet God God's expression of his love
[37:37] now many times see when we see that in
[37:39] our lives we don't understand that
[37:42] but say when God but see if we
[37:45] understand that all things work together
[37:46] for the good to them that love the Lord
[37:49] so if that was the case then when when
[37:51] God had a plan we don't see that we
[37:54] don't understand that why because here
[37:56] here's a family here's the Bell family
[37:58] sitting in the church brokenhearted and
[38:01] at the loss of their mother and you know
[38:03] and this in this one that had left the
[38:05] Tabernacle and it stirred brother around
[38:07] him but you know what that was God's
[38:08] plan
[38:11] God had God had a certain amount of time
[38:13] sister Bell was going to be here she
[38:15] lived her life she had a testimony and
[38:17] when she lived her life it was full God
[38:20] fulfilled she fulfilled her plan that
[38:22] God had for her when that was her time
[38:24] to go
[38:25] but brother Brown said see if I'd have
[38:27] known it was Sister Bell he said I would
[38:29] have probably been down there
[38:29] interceding on her behalf and that
[38:31] wasn't what God wanted
[38:34] why because it was time for her to go
[38:38] now there were times that brother round
[38:39] said that she had she had this issue she
[38:42] had been touched the Lord had healed her
[38:43] and administered to her and he said God
[38:45] had been merciful to her but you know
[38:47] what it came her time to leave
[38:50] well if it was time for her to leave
[38:52] then you know the one thing when it was
[38:54] time for her to leave then you know what
[38:55] she had a place to go to
[38:58] when this Earthly house was dissolved
[39:01] she had a body not made by hands Eternal
[39:03] in the heavens she had a place to go to
[39:06] that was eternal rest for her she did
[39:08] she laid down all of the cares and the
[39:10] problems and the worries and everything
[39:11] here and she stepped into another
[39:13] dimension that was greater that she
[39:15] couldn't even imagine how great it was
[39:19] and she stepped on into that Dimension
[39:21] and how great it was but see many times
[39:23] we begin to hold back and we went well
[39:26] why did God allow this thing to happen
[39:27] why did this happen why was that but see
[39:30] we're not supposed to sorrow Paul said
[39:32] not like the others why because if we
[39:34] understand the plan of God if we
[39:36] understand that God then you know what
[39:37] there's a place for them to go to
[39:40] so when they step on over and they you
[39:42] know what they're better off than we are
[39:45] then they have finished their course
[39:47] they run their race well praise God and
[39:49] you know what then yeah we have our
[39:52] heartaches we have our troubles we have
[39:53] our pain
[39:55] that doesn't discount any of that
[40:02] you know I've thought so many times that
[40:04] you know I would
[40:07] you know there's there's days
[40:12] you know there's days that I wake up and
[40:13] you know what I think man I would what I
[40:16] wouldn't give to see my dad again
[40:20] that's right you know like you know if I
[40:22] could just hug my dad one more time
[40:25] if I could just hold his hand one more
[40:26] time
[40:28] but you know when that when you get into
[40:30] situations like that but when you
[40:31] realize you know he's in a better place
[40:33] than I am today
[40:36] when you when you begin to see where
[40:38] where they're sitting at today then you
[40:40] know what then you know what if I want
[40:42] to honor my dad I can't I can't do
[40:44] anything else for him he's gone but you
[40:46] know the one thing that I can do
[40:50] when I think when I think about you know
[40:52] because you know we live in filio love
[40:54] that's what it is I mean we still have
[40:55] love for our family because it's not the
[40:57] you know just normal human love
[41:02] but you know when you have the love of
[41:04] God but you still have love for your
[41:06] parents you still love them
[41:08] but they're gone but you know the one
[41:09] thing that I can do to honor my my dad
[41:12] is I can do what he wanted what he would
[41:15] want me to do
[41:17] my if my dad could lay over the banister
[41:20] of time to this this evening and speak
[41:22] to me that he would tell me not to stop
[41:25] he would tell me keep going son why
[41:28] because it's just a little bit further
[41:29] but you know what you keep going you
[41:31] keep pressing the battle you don't stop
[41:33] you're not a quitter
[41:36] and what because that's what God has
[41:38] given to us is produced in US is not to
[41:41] be quitters not to be given not to be
[41:43] given up not to be compromisers but to
[41:45] be just fight the battle as hard as we
[41:48] can go
[41:53] down
[41:56] one because it won't be long
[41:59] I don't believe it'll be long we'll be
[42:00] out of here
[42:01] we're going to meet them
[42:04] they're going to come back in this
[42:05] dimension
[42:09] he'd always face them so many heartaches
[42:12] and
[42:13] pains and struggles and
[42:17] Brothers says you know he said you can
[42:18] imagine he said
[42:19] we fight strains and and disappointments
[42:23] and he talks about having all these
[42:25] different
[42:26] disappointments and and problems and he
[42:29] talks about he said he said no wonder
[42:30] I'm a neurotic or almost a one
[42:33] he said you got people that are calling
[42:35] on the phone
[42:36] and he said they call you all hours of
[42:38] the day and night and he said they're
[42:40] calling they're saying Lord send brother
[42:42] Brown because I've got a I've got a sick
[42:44] child or a you know a spouse that's
[42:47] dying or whatever and you know and he
[42:49] said you hang up the phone and another
[42:50] one calls and you and you put that one
[42:52] down you pick up the phone here's
[42:53] another one calling
[42:55] hey you know about all the strain and
[42:57] all the pressure but you know he said
[42:59] the only thing Eastside can do is he
[43:00] said I keep my eyes on Calvary
[43:03] he said I keep my eyes on Kevin I keep
[43:05] moving because he said that's what he
[43:07] would have me do and that's all we can
[43:09] do we feel we see all these things we
[43:11] don't understand why things happen the
[43:13] way they do why they why they come our
[43:14] way why is all these things that we have
[43:17] to face but you know what we keep our
[43:18] eyes on Calvary maybe we don't
[43:20] understand these things but you know
[43:22] what God does
[43:26] foreign
[43:29] you just hold on to what God has given
[43:32] you
[43:34] you know brother Brandon said one time
[43:36] he was talking about
[43:38] these people and
[43:39] you know you see these people and they
[43:41] hold on
[43:42] they have faith
[43:45] they take God at his word
[43:48] and he said
[43:49] there was a there was a lady she had a
[43:51] sick child and she kept holding on to
[43:54] God for for for healing
[43:58] and he said he said after all the time
[44:00] that she put in to believe in and trust
[44:03] in God for a healing and believing he
[44:05] said she had the the child end up
[44:07] passing away
[44:09] and in the midst of all that he said all
[44:11] that went around the country and
[44:13] everybody all they could do is condemn
[44:15] Divine Healing because that child died
[44:18] and brother Bradham said in the midst of
[44:20] the time of that child dying because
[44:21] that woman had had Faith she was holding
[44:24] On Believing for a miracle to take place
[44:26] in that child and it didn't ever come
[44:27] for her but he said in the midst of that
[44:30] he said the doctors have lost tens of
[44:32] thousands of of cases but he said he
[44:34] said they would dare you to stand up and
[44:36] call Medical Science fanaticism
[44:40] why because brother random said he said
[44:42] if I if I paid if I prayed for a hundred
[44:45] people tonight and every one of them
[44:46] died he said I'd pray for a hundred more
[44:48] tomorrow night why because that doesn't
[44:51] change the word of God because he's a
[44:53] Healer he's the same yesterday a day and
[44:55] forever and if he's ever healed one
[44:57] person he can still do it tonight but
[44:58] let me tell you you can't override the
[45:00] sovereignty of God
[45:02] but you know what we still preach that
[45:05] God is the Healer we don't know when to
[45:06] be just like you preach the message of
[45:09] Salvation you speak to people and you
[45:10] preach the word of God to them whether
[45:13] whether they reach it they accept it or
[45:15] not that's not our job
[45:18] and just like when we pray over the sick
[45:20] we don't know what's going to take place
[45:22] but you know what we I'm gonna hold on
[45:24] and I'm gonna have my faith until it
[45:26] comes to pass
[45:28] well you know what hap what happens when
[45:31] you come to a time in your life when
[45:33] there's
[45:35] everything goes wrong
[45:38] when when the when the things don't go
[45:39] the way that you won't want them to go
[45:45] what do we do then
[45:50] when brother Branham he was speaking of
[45:52] job and you know job was out there and
[45:57] here's here's a man a great testimony as
[46:01] a great man of God living lived a life
[46:05] and live such a life that when Satan
[46:08] come to God and was speaking to him
[46:09] about walking through in the earth and
[46:11] seeing all these things that God pointed
[46:14] job out and said have you considered my
[46:16] servant job
[46:18] there's none like him in the Earth
[46:22] well you know what if that was me I'd
[46:24] say
[46:25] I'll pass on that brother
[46:28] but you know what God had confidence in
[46:30] job
[46:32] didn't know what was going to take place
[46:35] job had no understanding of that
[46:39] but you know what God had confidence in
[46:41] job
[46:44] and when Satan come to job he says well
[46:47] you know you got that hedge around him
[46:49] you know he's like your little pet over
[46:51] there
[46:53] look at the way you treat him
[46:58] but he was like let me get my fingers on
[47:00] him I want to get a hold of him
[47:03] hey let me touch him for a while I
[47:06] promise you he'll catch you to your face
[47:07] he'll curse you
[47:12] and God had enough confidence in job
[47:14] he turned around and said
[47:17] have at him
[47:19] there you go
[47:20] lay your hands on him
[47:22] she can't take his life
[47:25] in the midst of look at job he's out
[47:28] there offering those sacrifices
[47:31] perhaps one of my children have sinned
[47:34] and I'm offering a sacrifice to God for
[47:36] my children
[47:39] holding the token up for his children
[47:40] every day
[47:45] many times we have we have situations we
[47:47] don't understand
[47:49] especially amongst our children
[47:53] like somebody said parroting ain't for
[47:55] the weak of heart
[48:00] you know
[48:02] you got to be
[48:04] you've got to be tough because let me
[48:05] tell you that it don't all it ain't
[48:07] anywhere of any bed of roses
[48:10] there's a lot of issues and a lot of
[48:12] problems but you know what God is
[48:14] faithful
[48:16] here's here's job standing in the midst
[48:18] of all this
[48:21] and all of a sudden all everything that
[48:23] job had all of his great possessions all
[48:26] of his animals are dead all of his
[48:28] children are dead
[48:29] everything is gone everything's
[48:31] destroyed
[48:32] he's got Bulls all over him
[48:36] but you know what he didn't understand
[48:38] what was going on but the one thing
[48:40] about job
[48:41] he didn't he didn't charge God foolishly
[48:45] he didn't he didn't he didn't understand
[48:46] but you know what he still had faith in
[48:48] God
[48:49] he didn't understand or the the
[48:51] situation he was in why everything had
[48:53] befallen him but you know what he still
[48:55] had faith in God
[48:58] and in the midst of all of that there he
[49:00] is his brother Ram said he was out there
[49:02] scratching those Bulls off
[49:06] with a piece of glass sitting on an ash
[49:09] Heap
[49:11] but you know what he didn't
[49:14] worry about that
[49:16] because he still knew inside of his
[49:19] heart he's thinking I'm still right with
[49:21] God
[49:22] I've still done and I was God knows the
[49:25] Integrity in my heart but I don't
[49:26] understand this
[49:29] now brother Brandon says this is this is
[49:31] from the message I know this is number
[49:33] one brother Graham says and he said and
[49:35] now we come to those places
[49:38] we all come and I believe today that we
[49:42] are gathered here for something like
[49:43] that same purpose we are all on the ash
[49:47] heaps we have our troubles our ups and
[49:50] downs and our bad moments and our
[49:52] sicknesses and our heartaches and our
[49:54] disappointments so we come like this of
[49:57] a morning this Easter morning to find
[49:59] words of comfort like job was trying to
[50:01] find from his friends none of them could
[50:03] give him any consolation because of his
[50:06] trouble they were accusing him of being
[50:08] a secret sinner then in the midst of all
[50:11] that trouble God came to his rescue
[50:16] so we understand that when God came when
[50:18] when he went through all of these things
[50:20] and
[50:21] and to understand all the issues and the
[50:23] problems that that job had to face and
[50:26] all the things that he was going through
[50:28] and all of this and you you see how
[50:31] everything had went but you know he
[50:32] didn't charge God foolish but but he
[50:34] kept holding on
[50:36] to the one thing that he knew God was
[50:38] real and God was true
[50:40] and he didn't understand it but you know
[50:42] what it never lost his faith in God
[50:45] to the position that he came to
[50:49] and you know when all when all of his
[50:51] the Physicians of no value showed up and
[50:54] you know his friends come to console him
[50:56] and you know then all they all they
[50:58] could do was accuse him
[51:00] and even his wife said you know why
[51:02] don't you just Curse God and die
[51:04] in all the situations that he had went
[51:06] through all the problems but you know
[51:08] what he never he never you know he never
[51:09] changed it he had faith in God he never
[51:11] lost that confidence in God he never
[51:14] lost who God was
[51:16] brother Brown says he says he said why
[51:18] do we why do we come to these troubles
[51:20] he said what makes these come he said
[51:22] why should a Christian ever be perplexed
[51:25] why wouldn't not everything just run
[51:28] perfect for a Christian he said but it
[51:30] doesn't and we know it
[51:32] so why why don't we have all these
[51:34] issues and things why because that's
[51:36] part of Who We Are
[51:37] he said he said and sometimes having we
[51:40] have more troubles than when we become a
[51:43] Christian than we did when we were
[51:44] sinners
[51:48] he said he goes you know the script says
[51:50] many of the afflictions are the
[51:51] Righteous but God delivers them out of
[51:53] them all so we and he said he said God
[51:56] promised many afflictions strange
[51:58] feelings and strange things
[52:01] that we would be beyond that would be
[52:04] beyond our understanding but it's always
[52:06] done for our good
[52:08] just can't understand it because if we
[52:11] did then we would not be of Faith to it
[52:13] would not be a faith to us because we
[52:15] would go with an understanding
[52:18] but we do it and we have it and we
[52:20] believe by faith his word and that it's
[52:22] going to work some good thing for us if
[52:25] we could grasp that today on this
[52:28] morning if we could grasp that that all
[52:31] of our troubles that there's none of us
[52:33] immune from them but if we could realize
[52:35] that those things are for our good
[52:38] that we understand how all these things
[52:40] are written they all become for our good
[52:42] we don't understand them all these
[52:44] strange things happen how everything
[52:45] turns out we don't we can't under you
[52:47] know there's no way of trying to put
[52:49] your finger on understanding by Logic it
[52:51] doesn't make sense
[52:53] but the great thing is is God says that
[52:56] your thoughts are not my thoughts and my
[52:58] my ways are not your ways and my ways
[53:00] are higher than your ways and my
[53:01] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[53:03] and so when it comes to all those things
[53:05] and guess what we we don't we can't
[53:07] figure those things out
[53:09] but the good thing is we can take it by
[53:11] faith
[53:11] that we can trust him by faith
[53:16] how all these trials and tribulations
[53:18] they come
[53:20] they're they're
[53:21] more precious than gold
[53:24] how all these things come we don't
[53:26] understand why these things have
[53:28] happened the way they do but your
[53:29] brother Branham said when when you have
[53:31] when you become a God's Property when
[53:35] you become a child of God and he said he
[53:38] said he said do our confession
[53:41] through in him he said then all of a
[53:43] sudden it brings these things to come
[53:48] and and we have these we have these
[53:50] trials and all these problems come our
[53:52] way but we realize that we don't
[53:55] sometimes we don't realize that is the
[53:57] promise of God
[53:59] we have the promises of God in our lives
[54:02] but we don't realize it as being a
[54:04] promise of God we just see it as
[54:07] problems
[54:10] you know brother Brandon said one time
[54:11] he said you know he said we pray for
[54:13] priests and comfort we go to God and
[54:15] we're wanting peace and comfort and you
[54:17] know what we get
[54:19] we get trials and tribulations
[54:21] not realizing that is the peace and
[54:23] comfort that we get
[54:27] we don't see it that way
[54:29] but that's what God has for us
[54:34] he said he said that every trial that
[54:36] comes our way he said is is put upon us
[54:39] he said to perfect us for his glory he
[54:43] said it's to bring us to a place where
[54:44] God can make himself more real to us
[54:47] than we he was before the trial come
[54:52] he said I want I want to join in this
[54:54] morning with job to say he said I've
[54:55] lived long enough to know that's the
[54:57] truth I have seen it in my own life that
[55:00] every time great City a great situation
[55:02] Rises that I can't get around it or
[55:04] under it or over it God makes a way
[55:09] and comes out glorious he said I just
[55:13] wonder how his grace ever does it but he
[55:15] does it and remember in all these things
[55:17] Satan tries to make us nervous and upset
[55:19] us to get us to think oh why did this
[55:22] happen why couldn't I have been like
[55:24] this
[55:27] but see if we get to looking at our
[55:29] situations and not looking at the
[55:31] promises of God that we're not looking
[55:34] at what God wants us to look at
[55:37] then we're not putting our because you
[55:39] know I'll I'll put Joe could look at was
[55:42] all those bulls and that Ash Heap and
[55:46] all the different things that he was
[55:47] facing but you know there was something
[55:48] that he won't God wanted him to see
[55:51] who he was
[55:53] and God was working in his life and he
[55:56] said if we could only see these great
[55:58] things
[55:59] and he said he said brother said these
[56:01] crucial times in her life he said he
[56:03] said they press us on to the sacred
[56:05] Sands
[56:06] it brings us to the place where we're on
[56:09] the back side of the desert when we
[56:11] don't understand the plan of God but
[56:13] that what brings us to that place
[56:15] because God is working in our lives when
[56:18] we go through these things and and you
[56:20] see how all this is just all you go
[56:22] through you look at the life of Moses
[56:24] and and all the things that he was that
[56:26] he had to go through and he had to face
[56:27] and all the all the issues
[56:31] you know when you see a man that was
[56:32] that was so great and you know was
[56:35] raised in Pharaoh's home and great
[56:38] learning and and great understanding was
[56:40] so elevated in in Egypt everybody
[56:43] honored it you know his position
[56:47] he had he had he had the whole world at
[56:49] his fingertips he had had control of the
[56:52] whole world but you know what God
[56:53] brought him to that place
[56:55] for 40 years to beat it out of him
[57:00] now you you say why why did that take
[57:04] place why because it made Moses who he
[57:07] was
[57:08] it molded the character in Moses
[57:11] it molded him to the person that he
[57:13] needed to be
[57:17] when he was when he was a young man
[57:20] no doubt Charlton Heston muscular
[57:23] great looking guy come in there
[57:28] and I know the word the word says and
[57:30] I'm I'm the deliverer because you know
[57:33] what I've been taught this I have I have
[57:35] the theology it'll work
[57:38] but you know what it wasn't God's time
[57:42] but he had the theology right
[57:44] that's what the word says
[57:46] and all he ended up with a bunch of
[57:48] angry Jews a bunch of angry Israelites
[57:52] down there the children of Israel
[57:54] everybody's all upset wanting to fight
[57:55] each other and he had a dead Egyptian
[58:00] and all he done was just stirred to
[58:01] stirred them up
[58:04] but you know hey this is this is the
[58:06] plan of God
[58:07] this is the right time
[58:10] no it's not
[58:14] and then when he ran
[58:16] I spent 40 years on the back side of the
[58:18] Desert from being in great palaces and
[58:21] having the greatest things that are all
[58:22] in the world
[58:24] to following stinky animals around in
[58:26] the desert
[58:30] and having nothing
[58:33] but when he got to the place that he had
[58:35] nothing then you know what God could use
[58:37] him
[58:38] he went through all of that and all the
[58:39] struggle all the praying all the
[58:41] problems
[58:43] and when he got to the place and he
[58:45] realized you know he was still the
[58:46] deliverer
[58:48] he'd been the deliverer the whole time
[58:50] the word of God never changed in his
[58:52] life
[58:54] but he entered a new season in his life
[58:56] and when he got when he got on the
[58:57] backside of the desert and there was a
[58:59] burning bush experience for him when he
[59:01] came to that Bernie's Bush experience
[59:03] you don't hate him won't have anything
[59:04] to do with it
[59:07] well God you know what I'm I can't talk
[59:10] you know you know I that's not good I
[59:12] just no it's not me
[59:14] but all after all of that it brought him
[59:16] to the place that God wanted to use him
[59:19] and when he got to that place then God
[59:21] wanted to use him
[59:22] and he said listen I've got you you you
[59:24] go
[59:26] and I'll be with you
[59:29] and he give he gave him the signs
[59:34] and told him said you go
[59:36] and you showed these to pharaoh
[59:39] he said you can't talk
[59:41] that's all right you got a brother we'll
[59:43] send him
[59:46] his name's Aaron and if you've met any
[59:49] errands they know how to talk
[59:51] and talk and talk and talk so that
[59:53] wouldn't that wasn't a problem
[59:56] but when he went
[59:59] he went
[1:00:00] brother Ram said he went on a donk
[1:00:04] a little mule
[1:00:06] with a wife and a little kid and they
[1:00:07] asked him say where are you going he
[1:00:08] said I'm going to take over
[1:00:10] I'm going to take over Egypt
[1:00:12] the greatest army in the world the
[1:00:15] greatest civilization in the world
[1:00:19] a ball-headed prophet with a stick
[1:00:24] and he was going down our takeover
[1:00:28] he's like well you don't look like much
[1:00:31] well that's all right because I'm gonna
[1:00:33] be the biggest pain y'all ever had
[1:00:36] I'm gonna be the biggest heartache y'all
[1:00:38] ever had
[1:00:40] and he went down there
[1:00:43] and he didn't have to worry about you
[1:00:45] know
[1:00:46] what Pharaoh was going to do Pharaoh
[1:00:49] couldn't touch him
[1:00:50] he went right in there and he told told
[1:00:52] listen I come to see Pharaoh I got a
[1:00:55] word from the Lord from him
[1:00:57] and he went in
[1:00:59] he's like hey I got these two signs I
[1:01:01] got a I got a rod I can turn into a
[1:01:03] snake and make my hand leprous
[1:01:06] and you know when a lot of people when
[1:01:08] they would have went into that situation
[1:01:10] is like hey I got this stick and they
[1:01:12] dropped the rod all of a sudden it
[1:01:13] becomes a snake well you know what the
[1:01:15] Egyptian magicians could do the same
[1:01:17] thing
[1:01:19] but you know what it didn't Shake him
[1:01:21] right
[1:01:23] he didn't he wasn't nervous he wasn't
[1:01:25] concerned about any of that why because
[1:01:27] he knew what his commission was
[1:01:29] when those things came his way it didn't
[1:01:31] change him and so when he went in he and
[1:01:33] he began to speak and he said well
[1:01:35] listen
[1:01:37] I've got word that we're going out
[1:01:39] whether you like it or not
[1:01:42] we can do it the easy way or the hard
[1:01:43] way
[1:01:47] but God told Moses he said I have
[1:01:50] hardened Pharaoh's heart
[1:01:52] and they're not let he's not gonna let
[1:01:54] y'all go
[1:01:56] but that's okay we don't worry about
[1:01:58] that
[1:02:00] because we're going to show the people
[1:02:02] of Egypt who the real true God is
[1:02:07] because every one of their deities and
[1:02:10] all of the situations that they
[1:02:11] controlled
[1:02:13] the now God couldn't change the water
[1:02:16] back
[1:02:17] it became blood it wouldn't have changed
[1:02:20] it back to water
[1:02:21] couldn't stop the fleas of flies the
[1:02:24] frogs the hail the darkness
[1:02:28] hey when he come up there and told him
[1:02:29] it's coming
[1:02:32] then what he do Moses turned around went
[1:02:35] back to Goshen
[1:02:37] he had a place to go to
[1:02:40] and when it went all when all those
[1:02:41] things went through
[1:02:43] the death of the firstborn
[1:02:46] it led right up to the time it was time
[1:02:48] for them to go
[1:02:51] but it was amazing here's all these
[1:02:53] people in Egypt
[1:02:54] that well
[1:02:56] I got no confidence in this crazy man
[1:03:00] but after they see all these things
[1:03:02] even the children of Israel
[1:03:04] who were promised a deliverer
[1:03:08] that they were going to come out of the
[1:03:10] Strange Land they had a land to go to
[1:03:13] and here's this man comes on the scene
[1:03:15] and begins to show the Miracles that's
[1:03:17] taken place
[1:03:19] and yet they couldn't have faith to
[1:03:21] believe that they could get to where
[1:03:22] they were supposed to be going
[1:03:26] that when it was written that that's
[1:03:27] what we're going that's where we're
[1:03:28] going that's what we're going to do
[1:03:30] I've got a land flowing with milk and
[1:03:32] honey
[1:03:33] and it's where we're going we're going
[1:03:36] it's like but they couldn't get out of
[1:03:39] their own way
[1:03:40] to get to the land
[1:03:45] but see all these things come
[1:03:51] brother Rams says this is from the the
[1:03:53] message I know he says he said and why
[1:03:56] does God let troubles come
[1:03:58] he said God harnesses troubles
[1:04:00] puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey
[1:04:03] him and those troubles bring us into a
[1:04:05] closer fellowship with God
[1:04:08] he said there had been no rainbow until
[1:04:11] the flood came
[1:04:13] but after Noah was pressed into the that
[1:04:15] condition that he was in to float 40
[1:04:17] days and nights in a storm a little Arc
[1:04:19] pitching up and down in the water it was
[1:04:22] after the flood was over with that he
[1:04:24] saw the rainbow for its first time
[1:04:26] the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of
[1:04:28] Promise after he had been through the
[1:04:30] tribulation then he saw the promise
[1:04:32] that's the way you see the Promise after
[1:04:34] you've come through the tribulation
[1:04:36] like I've like that poem or Psalm must I
[1:04:40] be carried home to heaven on a flowery
[1:04:42] bed of ease while the others fought to
[1:04:44] win the prize and sell through but he
[1:04:46] sees he said we ask for comfort and
[1:04:48] peace God gives us the best he could
[1:04:50] give us trials and tribulations that's
[1:04:53] better than comfort and peace our
[1:04:56] Comforts is just beyond the river
[1:04:59] see many times these things come our way
[1:05:01] and you know you you see the the
[1:05:03] condition to all these things that that
[1:05:05] happen there's many people in the
[1:05:07] scripture that you know they they come
[1:05:09] into these situations and
[1:05:11] you look at the um
[1:05:15] the the disciples
[1:05:18] after after hearing all of the
[1:05:20] scriptures all these years of knowing
[1:05:22] what God was going to do
[1:05:24] they hear all the all these things no
[1:05:27] doubt hearing the prophets
[1:05:30] all the Scrolls read so many times all
[1:05:32] the things that were going to take place
[1:05:34] that the the Messiah was coming
[1:05:37] you know the Peter and John them their
[1:05:41] dad was telling them about what was
[1:05:42] going to take place he said I may not
[1:05:45] see this son but listen I'm going to
[1:05:46] tell you something there's a day of
[1:05:48] coming because the scripture tells us
[1:05:49] and we're looking for the Messiah
[1:05:52] keep your eyes open
[1:05:54] look into the scripture look what the
[1:05:57] word says and there's coming a day this
[1:05:59] word's going to be fulfilled
[1:06:05] and what a great day it was
[1:06:09] when Jesus crossed their paths and began
[1:06:11] to speak to them tell them who they were
[1:06:13] what their conditions were and letting
[1:06:16] them know all of a sudden when they
[1:06:17] began to see who Jesus was they began to
[1:06:20] realize this is the Fulfillment of
[1:06:21] scripture
[1:06:22] we walked into a condition wow look at
[1:06:25] this it's so great
[1:06:28] and then all of a sudden here they are
[1:06:30] you're going to follow me and we're
[1:06:32] going to that you'll be Fishers of Men
[1:06:35] and he began to crawl these cause these
[1:06:38] young men to come with them these men to
[1:06:39] follow him and he begins to speak to him
[1:06:42] and tell him that what was going to take
[1:06:43] place
[1:06:45] and it was so amazing because their
[1:06:47] lives were so wrapped up all they could
[1:06:49] see was the fishes and the loaves
[1:06:53] uh Peter was the thing that that Peter
[1:06:56] could see was when Jesus cursed the Fig
[1:06:58] Tree and the Fig Tree died
[1:07:00] wow that's amazing look Lord the tree
[1:07:03] that you cursed it died it's dried up
[1:07:06] he's looking at these amazing things
[1:07:08] take place
[1:07:10] when they're sitting when he's sitting
[1:07:12] beside the well and he begins to speak
[1:07:14] to the woman
[1:07:16] and he asked her for water and he begins
[1:07:18] to speak to her and they're behind the
[1:07:21] trees in the bushes and they're watching
[1:07:22] Jesus have a have this conversation with
[1:07:26] a woman of ill repute when he begins to
[1:07:28] speak to her and begin to understand all
[1:07:31] of a sudden he begins to tell her who
[1:07:33] she was and her condition
[1:07:37] and he begins to speak to a man they're
[1:07:39] moved by that it stirs them up man look
[1:07:42] at this
[1:07:43] and then when he begins to explain to
[1:07:45] them the word
[1:07:47] and he gives them the commission to go
[1:07:49] and cast out and preach the word and
[1:07:51] cast out devils and then they come back
[1:07:54] and they're rejoicing to to Jesus tell
[1:07:57] Lord look what we can do we can cast out
[1:07:59] Devils we're able to preach the gospel
[1:08:04] and he said listen
[1:08:06] he said don't glory in that Glory that
[1:08:09] your names are written
[1:08:10] in heaven
[1:08:13] now not worry about these things
[1:08:16] and how many times did he come and tell
[1:08:18] him listen when they when they began to
[1:08:20] show him the temple and he's there at
[1:08:22] the temple and he's looking he said well
[1:08:24] tear this Temple down three days I'll
[1:08:25] raise it up again
[1:08:29] and how many times did he stand there
[1:08:30] and tell the disciples listen he said
[1:08:32] the son of man is going to fall in the
[1:08:34] hands of sinful men
[1:08:37] began to tell them what's going to take
[1:08:39] place
[1:08:42] but all they could see was the Miracles
[1:08:44] the water being turned into wine the
[1:08:46] dead being raised
[1:08:49] all the things that took place in their
[1:08:51] life all these great things that was
[1:08:53] taking place it was just so amazing
[1:08:57] but he began to speak to him and tell
[1:08:58] him
[1:09:00] there's coming a day
[1:09:02] I won't be with you always
[1:09:06] but he said I must go away that the
[1:09:08] comforter will come
[1:09:10] man
[1:09:11] and he said when the comforter comes he
[1:09:13] said he'll lead you and guide you into
[1:09:15] all truth
[1:09:16] the spirit will come
[1:09:19] and he said and you will be Witnesses
[1:09:22] and he begins to tell them all these
[1:09:23] things is going to take place
[1:09:27] and the scripture says Hey pointing them
[1:09:29] back to the Old Testament prophets the
[1:09:31] Old Testament prophecies and he's
[1:09:33] telling them before it happens he said
[1:09:35] listen he said all of y'all will deny me
[1:09:39] every one of you will deny that you ever
[1:09:42] knew me that you ever spent any time
[1:09:44] with me
[1:09:46] because why because I have to die alone
[1:09:49] I have to be rejected
[1:09:52] but it's promised in the scripture
[1:09:55] that is my that is my that's my lot
[1:09:58] that's that's the prophecy that I'm
[1:09:59] going to fulfill
[1:10:02] but he begins to tell them in all these
[1:10:04] problems and situations that he's coming
[1:10:06] he stands there and tell him he said let
[1:10:08] not your heart be troubled
[1:10:11] he said you believe in God believe also
[1:10:13] in me and he began to express to him
[1:10:15] listen there is a place laid up for you
[1:10:17] but you're going to go through hard
[1:10:19] times you're going to be uh rejected of
[1:10:23] all men
[1:10:24] you're going to be persecuted you're
[1:10:26] going to be hated for my name's sake
[1:10:29] he begins to speak to him the whole time
[1:10:31] and express to him what was going to
[1:10:33] take place in their lives
[1:10:36] but you know what he brought Peter aside
[1:10:38] and he told Peter he said listen he said
[1:10:40] Do You Love Me
[1:10:43] he said I want you to know something
[1:10:44] Peter he said Satan has desire to shift
[1:10:47] you like we but I've prayed for you
[1:10:52] and he said listen when it comes to the
[1:10:54] place
[1:10:55] you don't understand these things
[1:10:58] even when he was in the upper room and
[1:11:00] he began to speak to the disciples
[1:11:03] y'all don't understand these things
[1:11:05] but he said one of these days you will
[1:11:07] understand these things
[1:11:09] he said that's the reason I'm telling
[1:11:10] you now
[1:11:12] I want you to understand these things
[1:11:16] and when he began to express all these
[1:11:17] things to Peter and he tells Peter
[1:11:19] listen
[1:11:21] when you go through these things I've
[1:11:23] prayed for you
[1:11:25] feed my sheep
[1:11:27] feed my Lambs
[1:11:30] he's trying to Point Peter listen
[1:11:34] there's a job for you to do
[1:11:37] there's a commission for you to fulfill
[1:11:40] ment you may you may not understand it
[1:11:42] Peter but I want you to understand
[1:11:45] what a wonderful God that Jesus could
[1:11:48] stand there and speak to him and tell
[1:11:49] him all these things
[1:11:53] when they went through all of these
[1:11:55] things and you know
[1:11:57] maybe maybe it was a little bit of a
[1:11:59] shock to him even after Jesus had been
[1:12:01] preaching to him and explaining all
[1:12:02] these things
[1:12:05] but here they are
[1:12:07] going up into the
[1:12:09] Upper Room
[1:12:11] to have the Passover
[1:12:13] and he begins to speak to him
[1:12:16] and realizing I don't have much time
[1:12:18] left
[1:12:21] he said I want to share this with you
[1:12:25] and he wanted to show the sacredness of
[1:12:27] breaking bread
[1:12:29] and the wine
[1:12:32] and he wanted wanted to have this
[1:12:34] communion with him
[1:12:36] not just Bread and Wine but he wanted to
[1:12:38] show his heart to him
[1:12:40] and he began to speak to him he's meant
[1:12:41] to tell these things listen this is
[1:12:43] what's going to take place
[1:12:47] but you'll understand these things not
[1:12:49] long from now
[1:12:52] you know then he goes out into the
[1:12:54] garden and he begins to pray
[1:12:57] and you know and you know and all these
[1:13:00] things and here and in the midst of
[1:13:01] praying and you know when the when the
[1:13:04] Lord begins to to deal with him and and
[1:13:06] you know the spirit leaves him and all
[1:13:08] those things and he's there and all of a
[1:13:11] sudden here comes the Pharisees in Judas
[1:13:13] and and the rest of them come to get him
[1:13:17] then all of a sudden all of a sudden
[1:13:19] it's like a light switch flipped on and
[1:13:21] you know what that you know all of a
[1:13:23] sudden it got real
[1:13:25] he got real for them boys
[1:13:28] after they had heard after they had
[1:13:30] heard Jesus speak about all this stuff
[1:13:32] and all of a sudden here's Jesus like
[1:13:34] why are y'all coming at night with with
[1:13:37] all these weapons and everything he said
[1:13:39] didn't I preach in the synagogue every
[1:13:41] day
[1:13:42] didn't y'all see me all the time
[1:13:45] why are y'all acting like this now
[1:13:49] but you know all of a sudden everybody
[1:13:51] when all they come to get Jesus
[1:13:54] you know what it was a foot race to see
[1:13:56] who could get out of Dodge first
[1:14:02] when he just told him that was going to
[1:14:04] take place
[1:14:07] and then all the rest of them here they
[1:14:08] are sitting around holding their heads
[1:14:10] trying to think and you know they're
[1:14:11] trying to sneak around
[1:14:14] Peter them trying to sneak around trying
[1:14:15] to figure out where Jesus is and what's
[1:14:17] going on
[1:14:20] when in the midst of all that and Jesus
[1:14:23] told him said listen you're going to
[1:14:24] deny me Thrice before the crows
[1:14:28] and then in the midst of all that here
[1:14:30] here they are and they come to Peter and
[1:14:33] he was with that man
[1:14:35] he's one of his disciples
[1:14:38] I got no idea who you talking about
[1:14:41] you're out of your mind
[1:14:45] I got I got no recollection of this man
[1:14:48] well let me tell you something your
[1:14:51] speech gives you away
[1:14:53] by your speech we know your Galilee and
[1:14:55] We Know Who You Are
[1:14:57] I don't know I don't know him
[1:15:01] but went through all of that
[1:15:04] went went through
[1:15:06] before Pilate all the things that Jesus
[1:15:08] went through here they are standing back
[1:15:11] looking trying to see what's going on
[1:15:15] can you imagine being in the crowd
[1:15:19] your lord
[1:15:22] when you've ate with him you've slept
[1:15:24] with him
[1:15:25] you've seen him walk on the water
[1:15:29] he allowed you to walk on the water he
[1:15:32] give you the word to speak and you
[1:15:33] walked on the water
[1:15:35] and you're standing there and you're
[1:15:37] looking at your lovely Lord Jesus
[1:15:41] and they strip him and they beat him
[1:15:43] until he's almost dead
[1:15:46] today beat him till he's almost
[1:15:47] unrecognizable as a human
[1:15:51] and then they March him up up Calvary up
[1:15:54] to mount go gotha to nail him to a cross
[1:15:59] and you're standing there and looking at
[1:16:01] that
[1:16:04] and you wonder what in the world is
[1:16:05] going on
[1:16:08] and here he is hanging there
[1:16:12] and here he is hanging on the cross and
[1:16:14] he's struggling to breathe and he's and
[1:16:15] he's barely hanging on and all of a
[1:16:17] sudden then he begins to scream out
[1:16:21] and all of a sudden when he screams and
[1:16:23] nobody understands what he's talking
[1:16:24] about
[1:16:26] he's like is he calling for Elijah
[1:16:31] but Joe then he dies
[1:16:35] and then all of a sudden
[1:16:37] all our hope is gone
[1:16:40] we got no hope at all he just died
[1:16:47] he's our Messiah he's our King
[1:16:51] everything's gone
[1:16:53] brother Rome said even creation
[1:16:54] testified that he was dead
[1:17:00] and here they are out what are we going
[1:17:02] to do now
[1:17:05] not not listening to what Jesus had told
[1:17:09] him was going to take place but they
[1:17:10] just look in the situation and how
[1:17:12] hopeless it is and how and how they're
[1:17:15] they're I mean they have no they have no
[1:17:17] concept of what to do they've long I
[1:17:19] mean it's just you know their mind's
[1:17:20] spinning what are we going to do
[1:17:25] and here they are in the midst of all
[1:17:27] well I don't know I don't know
[1:17:30] and here they are standing there dumb
[1:17:32] from all the things that they've seen
[1:17:34] right
[1:17:38] where can we put our confidence where
[1:17:39] can we put our hope there's no place
[1:17:44] but Peter says he tells the other
[1:17:46] disciples he said I'm going fishing
[1:17:49] he said I'm going to go back to what I
[1:17:52] know
[1:17:54] I got to get away from the crowds and
[1:17:55] everybody out I got to get out on the
[1:17:57] water
[1:17:59] and some of the others what we're going
[1:18:00] with you
[1:18:03] and after all the things that they went
[1:18:05] through and all the things that they had
[1:18:07] suffered all these things here they are
[1:18:08] going through all this
[1:18:11] here we are uh trying to try to make
[1:18:14] sense of all this
[1:18:18] but when Jesus raises from the dead and
[1:18:21] he begins to speak
[1:18:22] to the women
[1:18:24] and he tells them he said you tell Peter
[1:18:27] and the disciples to meet me in Galilee
[1:18:30] when he begins to speak to him and tell
[1:18:32] him he didn't leave Peter out
[1:18:35] he know Peter was broken-hearted
[1:18:38] but he told him to say specifically you
[1:18:42] call Peter you let Peter know
[1:18:45] and when he began then when they began
[1:18:48] to all see all these things take place
[1:18:51] and you know
[1:18:54] you know this this great joy comes over
[1:18:56] hey the Lord's risen
[1:18:58] you remember when he told us that he was
[1:18:59] going to raise what he did
[1:19:01] he's alive we've seen him
[1:19:04] and you know what it was almost too good
[1:19:06] to be true
[1:19:08] they almost couldn't believe that it was
[1:19:09] going to take place
[1:19:11] after he told them and told him and told
[1:19:13] them
[1:19:15] but all of a sudden now they're trying
[1:19:16] to get their mind around the fact that
[1:19:17] he's risen
[1:19:20] he rose from the dead well because he's
[1:19:23] done what he said he would do
[1:19:25] and then he begins to make himself known
[1:19:27] to all of them
[1:19:30] and brother Branham tells us he said see
[1:19:32] before there can be a resurrection he
[1:19:35] said there's got to be a crucifixion
[1:19:38] and brothers sisters he said there's got
[1:19:40] to be a crucifixion in our life before
[1:19:42] there's a resurrection
[1:19:45] when he rose and he began to speak to
[1:19:47] him he said listen now after you've seen
[1:19:49] all these things take place
[1:19:52] he said now I'm telling you what the
[1:19:54] rest of it's going to be
[1:19:56] he began to encourage them listen
[1:19:59] I'm going to I'm going to ascend but the
[1:20:01] spirit's going to descend
[1:20:05] and he began to tell them what was going
[1:20:06] to take place
[1:20:10] he said Terry and Jerusalem
[1:20:13] there's a place for you to be you'd be
[1:20:16] there he said and stay there
[1:20:18] Terry don't go don't don't do anything
[1:20:21] you stay there
[1:20:23] until you're in dude with no power from
[1:20:25] on high
[1:20:28] so there was a time for them to be there
[1:20:30] for those things to take place
[1:20:33] and when all these things have taken
[1:20:35] place then when they begin to the place
[1:20:37] that they see the Lord just Ascend and
[1:20:39] they go and wait
[1:20:42] then you know what he wasn't he wasn't
[1:20:44] you know one day or two days
[1:20:48] or they're trying to figure out why have
[1:20:50] we got it yet
[1:20:51] have we got it yet
[1:20:53] he said you're going to know
[1:20:56] when you've been endued with this power
[1:21:00] when this takes place
[1:21:04] and they go through all all those days
[1:21:06] waiting until that rushing Mighty Wind
[1:21:08] comes and it touches them and it fills
[1:21:12] them
[1:21:14] and instead of being scaredy scaredy
[1:21:16] cats and and worried about things and
[1:21:19] you know so
[1:21:21] so confused and and so messed up about
[1:21:24] things and not understanding you know
[1:21:26] what's going to take place but when he
[1:21:28] came when the Holy Ghost came to them
[1:21:30] and it began to Quicken the word to them
[1:21:32] then they realized who they were they
[1:21:35] realized because they began to recognize
[1:21:36] what Jesus had told them that was the
[1:21:39] fact then all of a sudden then they
[1:21:40] become drunk men like drunk men walking
[1:21:43] out the door staggering out the door
[1:21:47] he's like well we got a bunch of drunk
[1:21:50] people up here
[1:21:52] and what was it
[1:21:55] Peter began to preach them and the 11
[1:21:57] began to preach
[1:21:58] what was it this is they're not drunk
[1:22:01] like you're supposed
[1:22:03] but what do you but this is that that
[1:22:05] was prophesied by the prophet Joel this
[1:22:08] is the Fulfillment of the word and they
[1:22:10] began to preach to him and tell them who
[1:22:12] Jesus was and what Jesus came to do and
[1:22:15] they began to preach to them
[1:22:18] and it and the Holy Ghost was so real to
[1:22:21] them that they began to hear that
[1:22:23] message in their own language
[1:22:26] how how we hear every man in our own
[1:22:28] tongue we we're hearing these great
[1:22:30] things of God that's taken place
[1:22:33] well what what amazing thing and all of
[1:22:36] a sudden as as many of these people that
[1:22:38] believed we know what they heard they
[1:22:40] were baptized they believed and the Holy
[1:22:41] Ghost fell upon them
[1:22:44] and we see all these things have taken
[1:22:46] place but you know what it was it was
[1:22:49] the move of God
[1:22:52] and so
[1:22:53] you know many times we see things that
[1:22:55] happen in our lives and we wonder why
[1:22:57] things go the way they go we wonder why
[1:22:59] things happen the way they happen but
[1:23:01] you know what there's a time and a place
[1:23:03] for everything
[1:23:07] we don't understand things may look the
[1:23:09] worst that they've ever looked
[1:23:11] you may not understand anything that
[1:23:13] you're going through
[1:23:16] you may be on an ash Heap just like job
[1:23:18] and trying to figure out what's taking
[1:23:21] place and why things are going that way
[1:23:24] but you know what there was a man that
[1:23:25] come to job and began eliu began to
[1:23:28] speak to him and tell him the word and
[1:23:30] begin to imagine preach the word to him
[1:23:32] and show him
[1:23:34] and then the Lord came and spoke to job
[1:23:36] and began to speak to him
[1:23:39] brother Brian said he had a revelation
[1:23:42] of the Resurrection
[1:23:44] he saw those things and he said he said
[1:23:47] I know in the last days he said he said
[1:23:49] I'll see him with my own eyes
[1:23:51] he said I know my redeemer liveth when
[1:23:54] all the things that he had been through
[1:23:55] all the problems and all the confusion
[1:23:57] and all the disappointments that he had
[1:23:59] went through when God began to speak to
[1:24:02] job and he began to understand he began
[1:24:04] to reveal the word to him he said he had
[1:24:07] job had to had to receive a divine
[1:24:10] revelation and that's what it takes we
[1:24:12] have to have a divine revelation and
[1:24:15] when you receive that Revelation then
[1:24:16] God begins to express to you tell you
[1:24:18] the things that why things are the way
[1:24:20] they are
[1:24:21] you know we we want to do things the way
[1:24:24] we want to do it we want things to work
[1:24:25] out the way that we want them to work
[1:24:27] out
[1:24:28] but that's not God's plan
[1:24:31] many times you know we may suffer and
[1:24:35] and
[1:24:36] you know if we have loved ones that you
[1:24:39] know we want to
[1:24:40] see healed or or different things that
[1:24:42] happen in their lives
[1:24:46] and those things don't happen
[1:24:50] but you know
[1:24:51] all things work together for the good
[1:24:54] whatever whatever the situation is it
[1:24:56] may it may not be what we want it to be
[1:24:58] but you know what if God has it in
[1:25:01] control
[1:25:02] it'll work out for his honor and Glory
[1:25:06] and it'll brother said it'll be for our
[1:25:09] benefit it'll be for us
[1:25:12] many times we don't understand that
[1:25:15] but brother REM says you know one thing
[1:25:18] when these trials and tribulations and
[1:25:21] problems brother REM said they ask Heap
[1:25:23] don't last forever
[1:25:24] thank God the ash Heap doesn't last
[1:25:27] forever
[1:25:29] why because there's a Time Coming
[1:25:31] we may not understand all these things
[1:25:33] but we know that there's a time that
[1:25:35] it's all going to work out
[1:25:39] and we don't understand but God tells us
[1:25:41] just to be faithful
[1:25:44] just be faithful to what God has called
[1:25:46] you may not understand but just be
[1:25:48] faithful
[1:25:49] and all these things will work out in
[1:25:52] time
[1:25:53] Brethren said he said all made possible
[1:25:56] to us because there was one obedient in
[1:25:59] trial
[1:26:00] there was one who stood the test that
[1:26:02] was Jesus
[1:26:04] the one who was so obedient to the
[1:26:06] father to the father raised him up on
[1:26:08] Easter morning because it was not
[1:26:10] possible that he should be holding of
[1:26:12] death
[1:26:14] he said for I will not suffer my Holy
[1:26:16] One to see corruption
[1:26:18] neither will I leave his soul in hell
[1:26:20] for he was found faithful always doing
[1:26:22] that which pleased the father he said
[1:26:24] may we ever be faithful at the post of
[1:26:26] Duty no matter what our trials is and
[1:26:29] our troubles whatever may we be able to
[1:26:32] say always I know that all things work
