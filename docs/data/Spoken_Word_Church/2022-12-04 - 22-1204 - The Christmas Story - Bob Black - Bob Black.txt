========================================

normal Sunday school lesson and just talk about what this this Christmas season is really all about and uh just study on the Christmas story for a little bit oh God we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning Lord and I pray Lord that you're just bless the day and uh bless brother Wade as he's preparing oh God and bless our hearts Lord Jesus to receive and to be edified by your word this morning Lord we ask your blessing today in your name amen now Matthew chapter 1 and verse 18 says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privilege but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thou wife for that which is conceived in hers of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted as God with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bitten him and took unto him his wife and you are not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus now of course we know that's the the greatest gift that's ever been given to the world and this time of year uh you know all around the world people are giving gifts and let's just you know brother Brown said in the message he said Christmas now has changed the way we take Christmas if you ever studied it we are taking the Roman Catholic Church's conception of when Christmas was now I'm not going to read through all of these notes here but you can kind of skim it if you want to but the the uh the reason Christmas now is on December 25th is because the Romans used to celebrate this Festival of Soul Invictus their Sun God on on the December 25th and uh it said the cult of Soul Invictus was centered in Rome but it was followed across the Roman Empire Soul Invictus the god of the sun was one of the most important gods and he symbolized victory as he defeated darkness and Rose every morning Soul Invictus was the patron of Roman soldiers so you can see how Constantine when when he said he began when he decided to convert and said he had a spiritual uh experience he it would make a lot of political sense to just combine these two holidays the son of by the birth of the Son of God with the with the the the the date that they were combining um the date that they celebrated the rising of this this sun god Soul Invictus on December 25th brother William said actually Christ could not have been born on the 25th of December and be according with the scriptures because there's 30 foot of snow in Judea in that time so they it could not been Shepherds out on the hills and so forth they had been contrary to all nature he came like nature he came like a little lamb that's born in the spring last Springtime all the all the flowers are blooming and everything and that's when Christ came uh brother Raymond the pergaman church age he said now notice that Constantine gave special feasts unto the people they were the old Pagan Feast with new names taken from the church or in some cases Christian rights were taken an abuse with Pagan ceremonies he took the worship of the Sun God and changed it to the Son of God instead of celebrating on December 21st which is when they used to celebrate the Feast of the sun god they put it up to December 25th and called it the son of God's birthday but we know that he was born in April when life comes forth not in December now look at that if you want to see what Constantine looked like there it is that the church in Rome began formerly celebrating Christmas on December 25th and 336 during the reign of the emperor Constantine and Christmas didn't become a major christian Festival until the 9th century now there was this guy um this this this uh saying that the uh that the Catholics have venerated called Saint Nicholas of Myra that had a he he was a um you know I really he did a lot of good deeds and one of his most notable D's was he would go around and he he gave there was some some girl three sisters that they they were gonna have to turn to prostitution if they didn't get a dowry for a good husband so he uh around cover of night he gave him the uh the money to to be able to provide for him and did a lot of other things like that where he would give gifts uh in secret without anybody knowing so he did you know a lot of good things and so the Catholics uh you know how they like they like to venerate uh dead people and and give worship to Saints and so forth so they they would they had this Festival on December 6 every year where they would give gifts in honor of Saint Nicholas of Myra that's where Saint Nick comes from now the reason Martin Luther when he began to had that Awakening and the reformation and so forth he he he began to realize we don't need to be doing this let's shift the focus up of this man we want to shift it to Christ so he said cry he said Christ is where you get all your gifts from so let's give gifts on December 25th not December 6 and even today in Germany if you go and see where they'll say they they're getting gifts not from Saint Nicholas but from Chris Keane and Ken does the the German word for you know like a child like kindergarten so they call it Chris canned so the custom of giving to children at Christmas was propagated by Martin Luther as an alternative to the previous very popular gift custom on Saint Nicholas to focus the interest of the children to Christ so brother Brown said so as we This Time of the Season as we focus our thinking towards Christmas it's too bad that we have to allot it to a myth called Santa Claus and instead of the real Christmas that is supposed to be many little children in the land today know nothing more than Christmas Means a sleigh full of toys and some Mystic reindeers bouncing on the house to only learn later of this myth to even hurt their faith when it comes to know the true Christmas story that it had nothing to do with reindeers or a man smoking a pipe with fur around his coat how would it hurt your faith is because we want to tell the truth we want to tell our kids the truth and if they find out that their parents told them a lie um then it then then they begin to question the reality of everything else that they've been told in the in Divine Healing brother Brown said and the fact of all the error and everything there is about it there's something about it that the world tries to make it an Excellence you know but God still got a Christmas in it somewhere hasn't he he's your ass he's got something about it just the very names and the thoughts of the birth of the Lord Jesus Oh the world's put Santa Claus in his place sure but not to the Christian it's still a Christmas and aren't you glad this morning that we can do like Martha Martin Luther did and try to divert the people's attention back from Santa away from Santa Claus and away from Saint Nick and away from veneration of saints and and uh and even looking at the Soul Invictus and all those things that the Romans had put in and looked straight to Christ because that's that's what that's what it's all about is about Christ now now to get to the Christmas story Jesus said he said think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill so everything in Christ's life was to fulfill the word and the first thing the first thing about Jesus's birth did uh it fulfilled the scripture in Jeremiah that said my voice is heard in Roma Rachel weeping for her children now now if you look on this map you probably can't see it real good but just just there above Jerusalem and red is a little uh city right outside of Jerusalem called Rama now brother Brown said it had to be just at this time when this murderous King Herod nothing but a murderer killed all those little children that it might be fulfilled which was spoke of the Lord by the prophet saying in Rama Rachel weeping weeping for her children and they were not now you think about in Genesis I got some notes here that just say and Rachel died giving birth while on the road to Bethlehem in the midst of her suffering the Midwife tries to comfort her with the news that she is having another son and this way her child is both her cause of weeping and her hope for the future so we've got a story of of death but then there's hope something to look a promise to look to and Jeremiah's day when he wrote This Promise Rachel was weeping over her children once more because they were being led into captivity in Exile near that very same spot where she's buried but they were comforted with the promise that her children will return somebody's not happy once again her Offspring her both her cause of weeping and her hope for the future and in Matthew's day Rachel weeps yet again this time over the slaughter of all those children that a Herald was trying to kill because there was a child coming a child of Promise so in the midst of Sorrow There's Hope coming forth now Herod raise those taxi he raised those taxes raises taxes to to force Mary and Joseph back to Bethlehem where the the scripture in Micah chapter five two there's another scripture that's being fulfilled but thou Bethlehem and frata thou thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel whose goings forth have been from old from Everlasting uh in in Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 it says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph you think about think about all the grief that that little girl had to go through all the to being looked down on saying that she was living uh living in sin and and Joe the situation here that's unfolding that Joseph was it was a mature man and he was a widower he already had four kids and he was a just man when this situation unfolding a scripture is being fulfilled brother Adam said she told she must have told in this young virgin beautiful young Jewish maid she become we're all adults here as far as I can see she become to be mother and Joseph going with her noticed this no doubt after he was espoused to her he found out that she was to be mother now he was a just man the Bible said he was she must have told him of her innocence the lovely woman I can hear just as it were to say Joseph my beloved friend my beloved husband I am innocent of this and she must have told him of the visit with her and the great Archangel that the Archangel had come to her Gabriel and had visited her with these these great signs that he had told her about that what was going to happen and Joseph being a just man he kind of wondered you know now I know if she's caught in adultery the first thing is going to happen to her she's going to be stoned she cannot so to Joseph it seemed like that Mary was trying to get him to be her shield from the scoffers and scorners see Joseph was to be her Shield go ahead and marry her anyway anyhow and be her Shield but not to be a husband to her in the family of relation God has at all times all ages spoke to his people that the scripture says while he's thought on these things he thought on what his actions should be and what the situation was is this really true behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream Satan Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thou wife for that which is conceived in hers of the Holy Ghost God has at all times all ages spoke to his people and revealed himself by dreams now dreams are not an assurance every dream is not from God now there's many people that has dreams and they have all kinds of dreams and you go to bed at night and eat a big supper and go to bed and you might dream anything you might have a fever you might have all kinds of nightmares and so forth that isn't God but yet God does deal with people through dreams if you'll notice when you read this story of how specific God was when he when he gave this dream to Joseph there wasn't any and there wasn't any need for any interpreting he was very explicit with what was going on he knew he knew what God was trying to tell him a spiritual dream is interpreted rightly interpreted as the same as a vision and what is a vision a vision is the forecast of future events it foretells the thing before it happens and that's the way God always Vindicated whether it was true or not or whether the man that was in the Old Testament was supposed to be a prophet what he said come to pass then they knowed if this man said this and they kept constantly coming to pass now that man cannot just be laid hands on him or shook up and give a gift he is born with that gift born in him when he's born before he's born he pondered on these things it was so unusual he could hardly comprehend that how could those things be I think maybe if we meditate on these things this morning this is almost the same situation is unfolding now that what that that Joseph had a promise that Christ was going to be born that he was going to be born in a manger now there's a promise that Christ is going to be manifest in this day and you know we we can ponder about things how can these things be but when Christ when God comes down and reveals it to you then then you are willing to become a shield to the word you are willing to take on all the reproach and all the rejection and you're willing to take on everything everything that's necessary to see God's word fulfilled and brother Adam said he no doubt sat down prayed over it studied it in the scriptures how could these things be while he was studying the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream if you'll just yield yourself to God God has gotten many ways that he can reveal himself to you see he might not you might not be a prophet you might not be a teacher you might not be a Sunday school teacher you might not be a preacher but there's ways that God can reveal to himself to you you see isn't that interesting that while he was studying the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream whether it might be dreams it might be in some other way if you'll just submit yourself like Joseph did um somebody was sharing me recently they were listening to brother George Smith talk telling some folks about how if you want to be closer to God then then this and and you know we don't believe in making New Year's resolutions but I believe in putting a stake in the ground and saying I'm going to be I'm going to try to do better and brother George said if you want to next year you want to be closer to God and just just say ever every day I'm gonna I'm gonna just listen to 20 minutes of a sermon and just read one page of the church age book and just read one page out of your Bible and come back next year and see if you're not closer to God so you see while he was studying the angel of the Lord appeared to him and if you if we'll open ourselves to open ourselves up to God and and just submit submit ourselves like Joseph did then God will do something in our life now then God sent his Angel and revealed it his revelation of the dream to come to Joseph he knowed there was no mystery in it there was no mystery in it the angel came to him in a dream he saw the angel in his dream then when Joseph Rose from his sleep oh how his heart must have been full of newborn faith and when God in any way that he desires to do it reveals to you the question that is that's in your mind there's no more doubt there's no more question about it it's a revelation and everything everything about the gospel has to come by Revelation otherwise we're just probing at it like Joseph was probing at it is this child really something from God or not and we pray when we hunt is this message really true is this is this something that's really from the Lord but when God comes down and reveals it then then there's no mystery in it anymore and you have confidence in it you know it just like Joseph and you he knew he knew enough to have confidence to take on all their approach of Mary and protect her and be her Shield when a man can be revealed that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter how many Creeds try to turn it back you're glad to be a shield you're happy to be a shield let them say whatever you got a big Shield up there to knock the fiery darts off and that means they can say whatever they can say well all of these things that the naysayers say about the pictures and the pillar of fire and all sorts of things that they've on their websites but but you've got a revelation so you're glad to be a shield because you know you know the doctrine you know God has revealed it to you you're happy to be a shield you're you're a doormat whatever wants to be it doesn't matter it's been revealed to you by the Lord then when the king gave his commandment just when the Christ was being formed now let's take them just a moment just when the Christ was being formed all the government came against them and everything let's watch them carry them just a little bit before we close I can see Joseph say Mary darling that cruel King but she'd say listen to her remember the Holy Ghost told me that his name Shall be Called Jesus and he shall save his people from their sins now Joseph dear no matter what takes place and what the king says I am able I can sit up on the little mule at several miles up around these Rocky Mountains and so forth your brother Brown said in one place every Christian is going to have a positive confession to say that I'm able I'm able to to travel the hard over the Rocky Mountains and over the hard places and he said if we happen to need a little help there'll be many in the journey because we're not the only family there's others that suffer the same thing we have so there's others along the road and we can kind of go along with the rest of the crowd as they go up the hill and go up into Bethlehem or from Nazareth they come up across the mountain now we find out that he must have got the little donkey and fed him an extra bunch of hay and some Oaks that day because the little lady was pretty heavy so he sets her up on the little meal and puts a bag of water and a few little biscuits and gets the little donkey and gets his stick in the hand and up the road they start over the little mule is staggering and falling oh look where that little fellow is packing look at his burden what it is he's bearing the Christ to his birthplace and here this little woman sitting up on there in pain to be delivered holding it to the Mane of the little mule and speaking to him as she goes along the road now I hope maybe you can read you know the gospel is in layers and you can read that there's there's something that can be applied to us in this day that you know brother Ryan preached that message birth pain as you go along the road and you're packing the word and it's gonna come forth despite all the all the Staggering and falling and all the all the tribulations of life yet there's going to be a birth and that's that's what we're that's the that's the objective and brother Brown said finally it began to get dark Travelers along the road much more able to travel faster and they'd come on by and she had to breathe the dust to the rest of them upon horses and carriages and so forth that they could go over it because she had to travel real slow on the account of her condition what a cruel thing to send that mother up there in that condition but I can just imagine now and the little drama as they come up to the top of the hill Bethlehem sits in a kind of a valley and on the West Side of the Mountain of Bethlehem the mountain where the little Trail comes out up comes comes up the stars begin to come out and after a while he comes up to the top of the heel and once again they look over into the city where they were both born over in Bethlehem the lights of the city many was there places was crowded people on the outside sleeping on the ground out along in the fields and the question perhaps the first time then struck Joseph's mind what will I do if I can't find a place because that baby might be born tonight she's been in pain all day so now what if that baby is to be born tonight so the stars begin to come out you know in in the Bible there's prophecy there's there's promises that in Isaiah 60 that the Gentiles shall come to that light and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising the multitude of camels shall cover Thee the the dromedaries of median and IFA and all they from Sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall show forth the Praises of the Lord now that promise had to be fulfilled in Psalm 72 the kings of tarshus under the Isle shall bring presence the kings of Sheba and sheba shall offer gifts was the name given by the Babylonians the medes and the Persians and others to the wise men teachers priests Physicians astral in other words to some spiritual people that had had been listening to Daniel when he was when the Israelites went down into Babylon and they could have had heard that all these things of the Prophet that that Daniel had shared of the Prophecies of Jeremiah and all the other prophets that that was going to come the Messiah was coming so they were looking for him and when you look for him he's going to appear to those that look for him brother Brown said nobody saw the light that Paul saw the same thing it struck him down on the road up to Damascus but it was given to Paul nobody saw the holy ghost coming like a light out of Heaven A Dove but John saw but he saw what he bare record he saw it the rest of them didn't he did for he was looking for it the Mage I were looking for it and when you are looking for it when you are ready to receive the real Christmas present the real Christmas gift God's Christ's gift the Holy Spirit you're looking for it you'll see it it's a Heavenly light sit down from God out of Heaven to Bear record of Jesus Christ now they didn't take anybody else's word in the daytime it was Restless they said oh I just can't wait I don't know how much longer we'll go we'll probably go to Jerusalem or down to the holy lands Palestine because that's where the prophecy said that this one is to be born at so we'll find it sooner or later oh we could have that perseverance like they did say I'm I'm gonna find out for myself whether it's right to search it out in the like the bereans did to see see whether this message really is true if they're really if that promise of the Holy Ghost really is for me or not and and and to travel and do whatever I need to do to get it now you think about this wasn't just a little uh just a little Excursion with some some gas stations along the way where you could stop and get you some beef jerky and some some root beer or something this is a long trip it was 900 miles that you journeyed all the way from over there in Iraq and you can see the journey you think about how long will it take to go 900 miles years it would take years to go that owner on camels stopping along the way having to worry about people robbing you on on the way but but they were after something they were after a promise because they were looking for Christ appearing so it says in Matthew Chapter 2 and we'll stop after after this he said now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea and the days of Harry the king behold there came wise men for the east of Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded that the more Christ should be born The Magicians can go ahead and come forward and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privileged called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh aren't you glad this morning that we know the reason why we give gifts and why we try to help one another out and why we worship that we're not just believing in some vain Roman tradition of Soul Invictus or Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas but we can serve a living God God bless you [Applause]
