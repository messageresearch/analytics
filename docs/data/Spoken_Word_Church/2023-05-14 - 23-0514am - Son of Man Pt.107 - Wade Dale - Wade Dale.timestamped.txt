[31:45] so this lady wrote now listen to this
[31:49] have you ever noticed how the scripture
[31:51] in the scripture men always go up in the
[31:53] mountain to commune with God
[31:55] yet in the scriptures we hardly ever
[31:57] hear of women going to the mountain
[32:00] and we know why right
[32:03] because women were too busy
[32:06] keeping life going
[32:08] they couldn't abandon babies meals homes
[32:11] fires Gardens and a thousand
[32:13] responsibilities to make that climb into
[32:15] the mountain
[32:16] think about it
[32:18] God comes to the women
[32:21] I was complaining about this to a friend
[32:23] the other day saying that even as a
[32:25] modern woman I feel like I'm never free
[32:26] enough for my from my responsibilities
[32:29] never in a never in a quiet enough or
[32:32] holy enough spot to have that type of
[32:35] communion talking about going up
[32:37] the mountain that I want with God her
[32:40] response floored me she said that's why
[32:41] God comes to women men have to climb a
[32:44] mountain to see God
[32:45] but God comes to women wherever they are
[32:49] I have been pondering on her words for
[32:51] weeks and have searched my scriptures to
[32:53] see what shed was true God does indeed
[32:55] come to women where they are when they
[32:58] are doing their ordinary everyday work
[33:00] remember Mary Mark the different ones
[33:03] he meets him at the well
[33:05] they draw water for their families
[33:08] in their homes in their kitchens and in
[33:11] their Gardens
[33:12] he comes to them as they sit beside sick
[33:14] beds as they give birth
[33:17] care for the elderly
[33:19] and perform necessary mornings and
[33:22] burial rituals
[33:24] even the woman at the empty women at the
[33:27] empty tomb who were the first to witness
[33:28] Christ's Resurrection were only there
[33:31] because they were doing their womenly
[33:33] chore
[33:35] they didn't come there to see Jesus they
[33:37] came to what anoint him they came to do
[33:40] their job their Duty and he met him
[33:42] doing their Duty
[33:44] the chore of properly preparing Christ's
[33:46] body for burial and this seemingly
[33:48] mundane and ordinary task those women
[33:50] found themselves face to face
[33:53] with divinity
[33:55] so
[33:57] if you like me this woman writing it if
[33:59] you ever start to bemoan the fact that
[34:01] you don't have as much time to spend in
[34:02] the mountains with God as you would like
[34:05] remember God comes to you
[34:08] he knows where you are and the burdens
[34:11] that you carry
[34:12] he's he sees you
[34:15] and if we open our eyes and our hearts
[34:17] we will see him even in the most
[34:20] ordinary place
[34:21] and in the most ordinary things
[34:24] praise God
[34:30] this lady's name is Heather Farrell if
[34:34] you want to look her up that was quite
[34:36] profound
[34:38] to hear that
[34:39] from a sister's perspective and
[34:42] sometimes we get all
[34:44] you think you get wrapped up in things
[34:46] it's kind of like Mary and Martha you
[34:47] know they kind of got you know they got
[34:49] a little argument there the Lord you
[34:51] know I'm doing the cleaning and why
[34:52] ain't this one doing he said okay just
[34:54] hang on a minute she's doing her job
[34:56] you're doing yours in other words it
[34:58] made the tables may turn so same way
[35:01] with all of us sometimes we think we
[35:03] don't get to commune with God because
[35:04] we're we run downstairs and have to get
[35:06] the food ready and and like last night
[35:09] we got we had pizza and thanks everybody
[35:10] for coming to bible study it's not Bible
[35:13] studying it was questions and answers
[35:14] all right and we had a real good time
[35:16] real good time in the prayer service and
[35:18] we appreciate y'all coming and um
[35:21] and being a part of it
[35:23] I remember brother Louise is it in
[35:25] Florida today hey brother Stan prices
[35:28] they had a Minister's meeting so he met
[35:30] some people that come from Arizona or
[35:32] somewhere I think remember today we only
[35:35] have one service
[35:36] then we're going to have a baptism
[35:38] service we're going to baptize brother
[35:40] Luke and if anybody else wants to be
[35:42] baptized the water is warm and we will
[35:45] be able to do that as soon as the
[35:47] service is over we'll just continue on
[35:50] down there
[35:51] all right brother Bob will be speaking
[35:53] for us this Wednesday night
[35:57] he preached my sermon again today
[36:01] I like that that's the way I I don't it
[36:03] doesn't bother me that's the way God
[36:04] works
[36:05] you know I didn't call him he didn't
[36:07] call me to ask the subject was preaching
[36:09] on today but uh the Lord lay something
[36:12] on my heart last night about deity and
[36:14] we're going to talk about deity because
[36:15] that has everything to do with a statue
[36:17] of perfect man
[36:18] on the 20th which is next Saturday
[36:22] we have our youth service everybody's
[36:25] invited it's a regular service but it
[36:27] will be for the Youth we're expecting a
[36:29] good many people to come if anybody
[36:31] wants to open their home they can open
[36:33] their home and say I can you know I can
[36:35] take care of a few we got some coming
[36:36] from
[36:38] Macon and brother Robbie says he's
[36:41] probably going to try to get here and
[36:43] with his family and I told him we'd try
[36:45] to find him a place to stay so um I'll
[36:48] be coordinating that with all of y'all
[36:50] during the week and we're going to have
[36:53] a taco bar
[36:54] so I want these sisters to get with
[36:56] sister June and see about what you want
[36:59] to bring everybody knows what a taco bar
[37:02] is it's a it's a it's just it's got all
[37:04] the condiments and you make your own
[37:06] tacos you just walk up make your own not
[37:08] a walking taco like we had in Ohio it'd
[37:11] be a little too messy we'll just keep it
[37:12] as a taco bar so get with sister June
[37:15] and and that will be what we'll have
[37:18] next Saturday will start at three
[37:20] o'clock

[37:39] um in prayer that those things will come
[37:41] out they come out already so some of
[37:43] them have some

[37:50] that's next month but I want to announce
[37:52] it because I want to tell you something

[38:01] country boil we'll have something for
[38:02] the men and their and their children uh

[38:13] planned so brother Andre's always wanted
[38:16] us to get together as two churches and
[38:18] and put a meeting together
[38:20] so I want to propose to you these two
[38:24] dates because in July last year remember

[41:07] again
[41:12] this is not bad we got uh
[41:14] we got time to do things
[41:16] but we got one service so we're going to
[41:18] preach just a little while like I said
[41:19] before last night
[41:20] I was thinking about something and and
[41:23] the the word deity
[41:25] and we'll weave it into the statue of
[41:27] perfect man in just a few minutes so
[41:30] let's bow our heads I know we all have
[41:32] needs we all have things that's going on
[41:33] in our life remember brother Louise as
[41:35] he comes back home today and all the
[41:37] ones that are traveling oh good to have
[41:39] brother Aaron and his family back and
[41:42] it's always you know Bob and all them
[41:44] are going it's always a piece of the
[41:45] piece of the body's gone and we're glad
[41:47] when they get back hey man dear heavenly
[41:51] father Lord thank you for this day that
[41:52] you've given us
[41:54] It's A Mother's Day
[41:56] and Lord as you said through your
[41:58] prophet
[41:59] their sets or stands The Fifth Gospel
[42:03] something that will
[42:06] we as men can't be mothers
[42:09] we can't mother a child
[42:12] like a mother can
[42:14] a mother can can enter into things and
[42:17] and emotions and feelings that we as men
[42:20] can't
[42:22] and they enter in Lord as
[42:25] each other as the scripture says the
[42:28] Elder
[42:29] will teach the younger
[42:31] and father we pray that that you'll keep
[42:34] our elder sister strong
[42:37] so that they can teach the younger ones
[42:40] how to do the different things as we was
[42:43] talking about doing sowing and cooking
[42:44] and stuff like that of life but even
[42:48] in scripture and in shining their light
[42:53] to each one
[42:55] father just be with us now and further
[42:56] in this service we thank you for all
[42:58] things we thank you for the church that
[43:00] we can go to a a building with people in
[43:02] it because without the people here today
[43:04] we couldn't have a meeting but father
[43:07] they all brought their little lick of
[43:09] fire and now we're going to put them all
[43:10] together and we're going to hear from
[43:11] you Lord I pray that you would take over
[43:13] this service and you'd be the active
[43:15] participant you'll be the one that does
[43:17] the speaking and the hearing please
[43:19] reveal yourself to us today Lord let us
[43:22] grow stronger and better and higher
[43:25] and closer to you forgive us of our sins
[43:27] Lord we all had we all raised our hands
[43:30] there was a need behind each one
[43:32] Lord I pray that you'd meet each one of
[43:34] those needs father
[43:35] in the name of Jesus we ask amen all
[43:39] right let's read and you'll be seated in
[43:40] the beginning was the word where was
[43:41] with God and the Word was God
[43:43] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[43:45] among us and we beheld his glory the
[43:47] glory the only begotten of the father
[43:49] full of grace and truth II Peter 1 says
[43:53] besides this
[43:54] wait a minute I'll get you
[43:57] I forgot to uh
[44:00] make it go up here
[44:03] oh there we go hold on hold on
[44:07] that better
[44:08] okay let's go a little bit more than
[44:10] that
[44:11] have that
[44:13] okay for the ones in the back
[44:15] all right
[44:17] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[44:18] among us and we beheld his glory the
[44:20] glory of the only begotten of the father
[44:21] what full of grace
[44:23] and Truth II Peter 1.
[44:26] it says then besides this giving all
[44:28] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[44:30] divert your knowledge and the knowledge
[44:31] Temperance Temperance patience patience
[44:33] godliness and Godless brother kindness
[44:35] the brother kindness charity look at
[44:37] that scripture back in verse
[44:39] 5 because it's going to be important
[44:42] once we get a little bit further along
[44:43] in the pyramid teaching it's not a
[44:45] pyramid teaching it's teaching on the
[44:47] Statue of perfect man using the pyramid
[44:49] as a graph all right it says add to your
[44:53] faith
[44:54] so as we said many many times before
[44:57] faith is not an ad
[45:00] it's a birth
[45:02] all right faith is not an ad it's a
[45:04] birth because when we get to this
[45:06] brotherly kindness
[45:08] you're going to see that that it can't
[45:10] be that there's that that faith is an ad
[45:15] it's add to your faith so you're taking
[45:18] your faith and you're adding something
[45:19] to it and then we're going to look up at
[45:21] the top of the pyramid where it says
[45:22] Holy Spirit and we're going to see that
[45:24] there's an interval the time to just
[45:26] stop and relax and calm down and we'll
[45:28] look at that as we continue on you may
[45:30] be seated Lord that is blessing to the
[45:32] reading the word good to have each and
[45:33] every one of you here we got a full
[45:34] house today
[45:37] First Timothy 3 verse 16 says without
[45:40] controversy
[45:41] great is the mystery of godliness that's
[45:44] what we're going to talk about today
[45:45] we've got through we've got through
[45:47] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[45:50] we're at godliness all right godliness
[45:53] and we'll read that and I want to that's
[45:55] where we're going to weave in I want you
[45:57] to see who you already are not who
[45:59] you're going to be then I want you to
[46:01] see who you're going to be
[46:02] they're by with me I want you got to see
[46:04] who you are first to understand what
[46:07] you're going to be all right and without
[46:09] controversy great is the mystery of
[46:11] godliness God was manifested in the
[46:12] flesh justified in the spirit saint of
[46:15] angels preached into the Gentiles
[46:16] believed on in the world and received up
[46:19] into glory and that word controversy is
[46:21] without Strife without dispute
[46:24] without quarrel so there's no quarreling
[46:27] about what's going on today it's what
[46:29] we're speaking if we speak the word of
[46:31] God there should be no quarreling we
[46:32] should know the Plan of Redemption for
[46:34] those of you that are new that are not
[46:36] um they've not been here we believe that
[46:38] God had a plan
[46:40] and a purpose
[46:42] and he was going to see it achieved
[46:44] through a group of people
[46:46] not through himself because he wanted to
[46:49] be a father he wanted to be a savior he
[46:51] wanted to be a Healer and to do that he
[46:52] had to make us all right as we were
[46:55] talking last night one of the questions
[46:57] was was Adam the son of man and no Adam
[47:00] was not the son of man Adam couldn't be
[47:02] the son of man because the son of man
[47:04] was some a a person
[47:06] that I just read
[47:09] that came in human flesh through birth
[47:11] Adam didn't come through human flesh and
[47:14] birth he came through human flesh by
[47:17] creation so he can't be your Kinfolk
[47:19] can't be your brother sure he's part of
[47:23] the human race the beginning
[47:26] but he was not your savior he couldn't
[47:28] save anybody couldn't even save yourself
[47:30] but the son of man came to what seek and
[47:33] save those who are lost
[47:35] so he couldn't be the son of man but he
[47:37] was the son of God amen so that's the
[47:40] plan of redemption and we go through and
[47:42] we know that we know as as Christians
[47:45] especially in this church we believe in
[47:46] justification sanctification the baptism
[47:48] of the Holy Ghost and we were talking
[47:50] about that a little bit last night
[47:51] because there is a question in people's
[47:53] mind
[47:54] am I really born again is this really
[47:57] happening am I am I a child of God
[48:01] all right and what stage am I in in my
[48:04] journey well you just gotta listen you
[48:07] gotta go to school
[48:09] amen you gotta go school you got to find
[48:11] out you got to talk to God let him talk
[48:13] to you through what through a minister
[48:15] through uh listen to the tapes through
[48:18] through reading through all the
[48:19] different things that and praying amen
[48:25] amen
[48:26] I told him last night we got finished
[48:28] praying
[48:29] and went back went downstairs and I told
[48:32] him I said I don't know what you prayed
[48:33] about but I said for 45 minutes I was
[48:35] asking God to forgive me of the things
[48:36] I've done
[48:39] sorry I was a little selfish last night
[48:41] I prayed for y'all too for a little bit
[48:43] but I prayed because I'm going through
[48:45] some battle all right
[48:46] and I want God to help me
[48:49] all right
[48:50] I don't want to be selfish about it but
[48:51] I do want to slip in there just a little
[48:53] bit and say hey
[48:55] here am I Lord
[48:56] you know we don't holler loud enough I
[49:00] guess but the Plan of Redemption is
[49:02] justification sanctification baptism the
[49:03] holy ghost that puts you in the body of
[49:06] Christ that gives you the new birth or
[49:08] it gives you that faith
[49:12] what the faith of God
[49:14] and I'll and I'll show you a little bit
[49:16] a little bit um well in just a few
[49:18] minutes
[49:20] how that all works
[49:23] Romans 8 verse 29 says for whom he did
[49:25] for no I got a number one by that whom
[49:27] he did 4-0 as we were talking about last
[49:29] night we'll keep referring back if you
[49:31] all have been here last night all of you
[49:32] I wouldn't have to refer back like not
[49:34] so anyway I know you can't be here every
[49:36] time but that's okay but we had a good
[49:38] time last night we learned a lot
[49:41] but he foreign you he knew everything
[49:44] there's not one time God has ever been
[49:47] deceived
[49:49] or something happened that he didn't
[49:51] know
[49:52] we were talking about babies going to
[49:53] heaven and and you know what if you're
[49:55] gonna uh two born-again Believers and
[49:57] you got a little baby and you go into
[49:58] raptures the baby gets stuck here and
[50:00] the other baby goes somewhere
[50:02] now listen the baby's not bright
[50:05] you've got to be specific the baby can't
[50:09] be bride bride is born again
[50:14] right
[50:15] but God's not gonna leave him here
[50:22] apparently hey buddy good to see you man
[50:25] both of you both of y'all back here
[50:28] good to see you
[50:30] so whom he did who God's only one that
[50:32] can for no God the only one who can tell
[50:35] the end from the beginning as you were
[50:37] talking about last night I'm sorry I'm
[50:39] going to slow down a little bit
[50:41] eight billion people throw a piece of
[50:43] paper at me or something if I get too
[50:45] fast Brother Anderson is interpreting so
[50:48] we'll slow down just a little bit
[50:50] I asked you mother day I said you say
[50:52] everything I said he said
[50:56] he has to interpolate and that's okay
[51:00] that's all right Paul Paul priest
[51:02] sermons and um did y'all see that on
[51:05] Facebook the other day where where
[51:07] somebody wrote and said if Paul was here
[51:09] in the United States today
[51:10] we get a letter
[51:14] because remember we go the Corinthians
[51:16] and they got a letter they went to the
[51:17] Thessalonians they got a letter he went
[51:19] to the Romans they got a letter you know
[51:22] they all got a letter we'd get a letter
[51:24] if he was in America today
[51:27] so seven billion people at this moment
[51:30] now there is eight billion people in the
[51:31] world eight billion people God knows
[51:34] every thought they're thinking and going
[51:35] to think their whole term of Life on
[51:38] this Earth one man
[51:41] amen so why are we going to worry about
[51:44] well I just don't know if God can do
[51:46] this and I don't want to worry God
[51:48] he's never run out of memory all right
[51:53] he's the greatest computer that ever was
[51:55] there is no time when you say too full
[51:58] so he foreknew every bit of this every
[52:01] situation you went through going through
[52:03] or will go through he already knows it
[52:06] but remember he's not going to make you
[52:09] do it he's going to see you do it and
[52:11] see you make a choice
[52:13] because you do have a choice remember I
[52:16] told you about the brother the other day
[52:18] and I was watching him online and I just
[52:20] I couldn't believe that a message
[52:22] preacher would look you in the face and
[52:25] tell you you don't have a choice
[52:27] I'm sorry that's not Bible That's not
[52:30] the prophet's message you have a choice
[52:32] you were born with a choice you are a
[52:36] free moral agent until the day you pass
[52:38] away
[52:41] that gives you a god-like quality to
[52:44] choose or reject amen
[52:47] that puts you
[52:49] in a Godlike quality
[52:52] but he saw the choice you'd make he
[52:55] foreknew you
[52:56] therefore he could predetermine because
[52:58] predestinate is predetermined
[53:01] but he didn't predetermine see if if
[53:03] it's like the brother said that we just
[53:05] don't have a choice then it is exactly
[53:07] what brother Brown said God didn't do
[53:10] is put you in a tube and say all right
[53:11] this is where you're going to go no I
[53:13] Like It where where God knows he's so
[53:15] infinite he knows that if that if Monica
[53:18] and Bob would have never married he
[53:19] knows who Bob would have married
[53:21] and what kids they would have
[53:24] that's an infinite
[53:25] God we're finite we we we funnel him
[53:28] down
[53:29] he's not funneled down
[53:31] he's a God that knows everything but he
[53:34] did predetermine that he was going to
[53:37] have a bride yes he was going to have
[53:39] somebody conformed in His image
[53:41] he made sure that as we were talking
[53:43] about last night in Genesis 1 26.
[53:47] he made sure he was going to make
[53:49] someone in His image
[53:51] and in his lightness and they were going
[53:53] to have dominion over the Earth and they
[53:55] were going to multiply and replenish the
[53:57] Earth
[53:58] they were going to do what God Said
[54:01] now listen they did what God Said but
[54:05] they didn't do all what God Said
[54:08] God said multiplying replenish the Earth
[54:10] and never put him in flesh he meant
[54:12] spiritual multiplication
[54:14] Satan said oh
[54:16] I can get into human I can get into
[54:18] human race if I'll just tell them to do
[54:20] this because the animals are reproducing
[54:22] and all these other you know the Beast
[54:24] was reproducing come on somebody that's
[54:26] what he used brother Brown said to you
[54:28] the principles of life
[54:30] and that's the way he could get in was
[54:32] to get in Eve's womb of her mind first
[54:35] and then the act happened there is no
[54:38] way except for rape and drugging and all
[54:41] that there's no way for a for any of us
[54:44] to do what we do without thinking about
[54:45] it first
[54:48] well pray for me
[54:53] but he predestinated someone to be
[54:55] conformed so in Genesis 1 he said let us
[54:58] make man our own image
[55:00] and let them have dominion over the fish
[55:01] of the sea in the foul there and
[55:03] everything that creeps on there the
[55:04] creeps on the Earth
[55:06] so he made a man
[55:07] which was a spirit man first but he
[55:10] didn't want Spirit man he wanted a man
[55:12] in flesh
[55:13] so that's what he did in Genesis 2 7 he
[55:16] took that 126 man put it in the 2-7 man
[55:19] which was as brother Brown says a man
[55:22] standing in the garden with roots like
[55:25] his feet and then here's a man 16
[55:28] elements of the Earth
[55:31] amen
[55:34] and then he could commune with that man
[55:36] but remember as we were talking about
[55:38] last weekend well we've got a lot of
[55:40] comments about our vowel renewal last
[55:42] weekend I think we probably won't wait
[55:44] as long to do it again that won't wait
[55:46] 15 years I hope we're not here for 15
[55:48] years more praise the Lord anyhow sorry
[55:50] about that but I hope we're not brother
[55:53] boy to be like hey
[55:55] a hundred and something years old
[55:59] 85 95 okay
[56:02] and Joyce will be as old as you anyway
[56:03] so don't matter it's what Terrence said
[56:05] I'm just telling you what brother I'm
[56:06] saying
[56:09] but we but in devour news you you look
[56:11] and you see that that man God was lonely
[56:14] so he made man
[56:16] so man comes on the earth he commends
[56:19] with God but there's something inside of
[56:20] him there's a desire
[56:22] there's a desire for him to have
[56:24] Fellowship listen with his self
[56:30] he desired to have fellowship with God
[56:32] sure God would come down they would walk
[56:34] on cool today but there was something
[56:35] inside of Adam
[56:38] they said I need to get out
[56:40] to be able to communicate with whatever
[56:43] this is inside of me
[56:46] isn't that what happened
[56:50] So Adam he lays Adam down takes a rib
[56:53] forms a body for Eve out of that rib out
[56:57] of that 16 elements of the earth and
[56:59] then he puts pardon that Genesis 1 26
[57:01] the female part he puts it into who not
[57:05] Eve
[57:06] woman R Adam their name was Adam before
[57:09] the fall all right she wasn't Eve to
[57:11] laughter the fall happens everybody with
[57:13] me so you see the same way you and I
[57:15] don't have a name we're we're human
[57:17] beings we're all these different things
[57:18] but until you're born again you don't
[57:20] have a name
[57:21] like the name that you're going to get
[57:22] when you get born again amen
[57:25] but he made a group of people to be
[57:27] conformed to His Image so somebody's
[57:29] going to be that because listen
[57:31] that's his desire yes his desire
[57:35] was to communicate with Adam and then
[57:38] Eve and then all that got broke but he
[57:41] said I'll put enmity in other words as
[57:44] we're going to see here in just a little
[57:45] bit he had to come back in flesh himself
[57:49] and become deity
[57:51] engulfed
[57:53] by flesh
[57:55] and by with me
[57:57] I know y'all patient yourself because
[57:59] you're not amen and now so maybe another
[58:00] two hours from now you'll be amen
[58:03] praise the Lord moreover whom he don't
[58:06] groan
[58:08] moreover whom he did what predestinate
[58:14] then he also called
[58:16] all right so one he foreknew what you
[58:19] would do two
[58:21] he then made an earth put you on the
[58:24] earth predetermined what you was going
[58:26] to do buy your free moral agency
[58:29] by your choice
[58:32] then he called you
[58:34] mean your call but if you're chosen
[58:36] already called everybody
[58:40] see that's where people the message are
[58:42] so narrow-minded well they just called
[58:43] us because we had this great seed in us
[58:45] and that's what caught God calls every
[58:48] person because he's a righteous judge
[58:54] and God's going to tell you the day the
[58:58] hour and the minute that he come to you
[59:00] and said be my child
[59:03] and You're Gonna Know It and you're
[59:05] gonna walk away with your head down and
[59:07] you're going to hell
[59:09] sorry like we said last night
[59:12] there's not a black white dog
[59:14] you either got the seal it we're talking
[59:16] about the Seal of God and the sit in the
[59:18] mark of the beast because another
[59:18] question was what would the market be
[59:20] well the mark of the beast is being void
[59:22] of the mark of God or the Seal of God if
[59:25] you're sealed in God you can't get the
[59:26] mark of the beef
[59:28] praise Lord
[59:30] you can't be
[59:31] you can be deceived but you can't be
[59:34] taken that's right when he seals that
[59:36] boxcar it sealed until the day of your
[59:39] Redemption you're sealed in Satan's
[59:42] sealed out come on somebody deity is
[59:45] inside of you God has locked the door
[59:46] not you
[59:48] no I didn't shut the door of the Ark God
[59:50] shut the door of the Ark amen everybody
[59:53] with me now wake up a little bit we'll
[59:55] say Amen
[59:57] I'll help you pace yourself okay
[1:00:00] I'm the one doing the work up here y'all
[1:00:02] help me all right so he called whom he
[1:00:05] called he justified so if he called you
[1:00:07] and you said I want more of you I can't
[1:00:10] stand I'm sick and tired of being sick
[1:00:13] and tired
[1:00:14] I don't want no more of this as we were
[1:00:16] talking about last night why would you
[1:00:18] want your former life
[1:00:19] if you're a former life is better than
[1:00:21] the life you got now you don't have what
[1:00:23] you think you got
[1:00:26] can I say that one more time
[1:00:28] you don't have what you think you got if
[1:00:31] you want pieces of your former life
[1:00:35] I'm trying to get it out where I never
[1:00:38] remember a speck of it
[1:00:42] praise the Lord
[1:00:44] be called
[1:00:45] then be justified he did it
[1:00:48] and whom he justified wow
[1:00:51] he'd give you a glorified body
[1:00:54] because he's the one that's going to
[1:00:55] have to give it to you
[1:00:57] a glorified body
[1:01:00] sister
[1:01:01] I asked last night said brother Brown
[1:01:02] says no Divine Healing
[1:01:05] no Resurrection she wanted us to explain
[1:01:07] me to explain that
[1:01:09] well look at it
[1:01:11] do you know today as we speak today
[1:01:14] up in Gainesville Hospital biggest
[1:01:16] Hospital in the in the area
[1:01:18] there's probably several thousand people
[1:01:20] in that hospital in different stages of
[1:01:23] hurting and dying
[1:01:26] but God has sent a healing angel
[1:01:33] the doctors came they set an alarm but
[1:01:35] they can't make the bones grow back
[1:01:37] together
[1:01:38] they can perform open heart surgery but
[1:01:40] they can't start that heart back up
[1:01:42] oh yeah they do the paddle and all that
[1:01:44] stuff but God's in control
[1:01:47] and then they can sew you up
[1:01:50] and you'll never heal unless God heals
[1:01:53] you
[1:01:55] so God is healing people that don't even
[1:01:58] want don't even care about him he's
[1:02:00] healing me and you if you're 98.6
[1:02:03] degrees right now
[1:02:05] you're being healed
[1:02:07] as we said last night I read in a paper
[1:02:09] the other day that you you lose every 10
[1:02:11] years you lose after you get like 40 you
[1:02:14] lose 10 of your muscle mass
[1:02:17] no way to get rid of that because that's
[1:02:18] the curse but you can help it and do
[1:02:21] something about it you can put not put
[1:02:22] so much put fat around it
[1:02:24] well praise the Lord anyway
[1:02:27] I thought I'd bring that out but listen
[1:02:30] it's healing us right now
[1:02:32] so no
[1:02:37] the Divine Healing of God away from that
[1:02:40] hospital every person in that hospital
[1:02:43] will die within just a few moments
[1:02:47] you lose oxygen you lose the firing
[1:02:49] mechanism that's that's pumping your I
[1:02:52] we were talking about last night brother
[1:02:53] Dale's 83 years old he's 83 years old
[1:02:55] think about that in 365 days then think
[1:02:58] about how his heart has beat 74 to 80
[1:03:01] well with y'all him preaching y'all
[1:03:04] maybe a hundred
[1:03:05] a hundred beats per minute
[1:03:08] from the time of being a baby till now
[1:03:12] who did that
[1:03:14] baby God did that
[1:03:17] oh no my body your soul
[1:03:20] yeah your soul is your fire mechanism
[1:03:22] but who made your soul
[1:03:25] who keeps your soul inside your body
[1:03:29] the healing angel of God yes sorry to
[1:03:31] get off of that but
[1:03:33] that's what's going to be our glorified
[1:03:35] body is going to be that we don't
[1:03:37] deteriorate anymore
[1:03:39] we'll still be 98.6 degrees I believe I
[1:03:42] don't believe we're going to be a much
[1:03:43] cold people
[1:03:44] praise the Lord
[1:03:46] amen will be who we are but
[1:03:49] there will be no blood cell
[1:03:52] deteriorate
[1:03:54] and then keep deteriorating to keep
[1:03:56] deteriorating praise God that's what
[1:03:59] we're heading towards but it's all
[1:04:00] because of what Grace he's even
[1:04:02] extending Grace to those people in the
[1:04:03] hospital right now
[1:04:05] healing them right now without them even
[1:04:07] knowing it and don't care
[1:04:10] so now look the impersonation
[1:04:12] Christianity 1957 brother Brown said and
[1:04:15] you're on the basis of what
[1:04:16] free moral agency that is the ability
[1:04:21] for you to make a choice amen you can
[1:04:24] turn it down
[1:04:26] oh don't tell me you don't have a choice
[1:04:30] you can preach all you want to brother
[1:04:32] Brown never preached we didn't have a
[1:04:34] choice
[1:04:35] but people in the message say we don't
[1:04:37] have a choice
[1:04:39] error
[1:04:40] you can turn this down or you can accept
[1:04:43] it
[1:04:45] to turn it down is to be lost and remain
[1:04:48] potash and calcium and petroleum but to
[1:04:51] accept it and to have a white a new
[1:04:54] heart
[1:04:56] a new spirit
[1:04:58] and his Spirit yes part of the logos
[1:05:03] in you controlling your emotions
[1:05:07] and when he Coos through his word you
[1:05:09] coup back and say a man
[1:05:14] that's your answer to him
[1:05:16] your answer to him today is amen
[1:05:19] have faith
[1:05:21] 1958 someday way back before there was
[1:05:24] any light on the earth our bodies late
[1:05:25] in the dust listen our bodies laid in
[1:05:27] the dust not our soul
[1:05:29] our bodies laid in the dust
[1:05:31] we are made of dust potash calcium
[1:05:34] petroleum Cosmic light God sent forth
[1:05:37] the great Holy Spirit to brood over the
[1:05:38] Earth and as he brewed the little
[1:05:40] flowers began to come and birds flew
[1:05:42] animals came up from the earth and then
[1:05:45] came a man
[1:05:46] and he sinned and separated himself from
[1:05:49] the fellowship of his God and because of
[1:05:51] this horrible thing he was commanded by
[1:05:54] God to return back to the dust of the
[1:05:56] earth and if we don't take a body change
[1:05:57] we are going to return back to the dust
[1:06:00] of the Earth all right because that's
[1:06:02] God's law he just said it
[1:06:04] thus Thou Art thus your return
[1:06:07] but oh Lord God we are so glad that
[1:06:10] before he returns you have promised a
[1:06:13] redeemer
[1:06:15] and today since he has come and sent
[1:06:17] forth the Holy Spirit again and now he's
[1:06:19] still brooding over the Dust
[1:06:22] our bodies
[1:06:24] and if he raised me and brought me to
[1:06:28] what I am now without having a choice
[1:06:30] now if you stop right there
[1:06:33] brother Brown said you don't have a
[1:06:34] choice
[1:06:35] no you didn't have a choice to get here
[1:06:38] not one of you sat in this building like
[1:06:40] I said before I tell him last night you
[1:06:42] go in any Auditorium you go anywhere in
[1:06:44] the world and you sit down in in the
[1:06:46] airport and you see five or six thousand
[1:06:48] people in Atlanta back and forth they
[1:06:49] all came from the same thing
[1:06:52] they all came same way everybody
[1:06:56] came from an act between a man and a
[1:06:58] woman I don't care if it was done by a
[1:06:59] doctor with artificial and all this it
[1:07:01] was a man and a woman and they were born
[1:07:04] through a womb or come to a woman one of
[1:07:06] the two amen
[1:07:07] all right so but remember you didn't
[1:07:10] have a choice getting here
[1:07:12] but
[1:07:13] when you get here
[1:07:15] you get a choice
[1:07:17] because I read right here look
[1:07:19] he made me what I am now without having
[1:07:21] a choice how much more will he raise us
[1:07:24] from the dust of the earth after we've
[1:07:27] made a choice
[1:07:29] and he has brewed to us and we brewed
[1:07:32] back to him we love him
[1:07:36] all right a time of decision 1959 just
[1:07:39] as Eliza watch that sign on the girl
[1:07:41] you'll have to watch this sign of the
[1:07:42] church because Jesus said
[1:07:44] I don't care what man said I know men
[1:07:46] say these days and miracles has passed
[1:07:48] all this stuff is all passed and going
[1:07:50] by there's no more
[1:07:52] now you've got to make a choice
[1:07:55] Jesus said let every man's word be alive
[1:07:57] mine be true now you've got to make up
[1:08:00] your mind
[1:08:02] and you've got to make a choice
[1:08:05] does that sound like not making a choice
[1:08:08] look I want you to really read this
[1:08:11] quote
[1:08:13] and this may be your last time to make a
[1:08:16] choice
[1:08:18] tomorrow may be too late
[1:08:21] God might have chosen you watch this
[1:08:24] only a prophet could say this and make
[1:08:26] sense out of it God might have chose you
[1:08:29] to eternal life
[1:08:30] all right
[1:08:33] but if you don't make up your mind and
[1:08:36] accept it somebody else will take your
[1:08:39] place
[1:08:42] don't tell me you were born no special
[1:08:44] somebody
[1:08:45] you were born dead
[1:08:47] and you had to make a choice to receive
[1:08:49] eternal life if you didn't
[1:08:52] God's going to give it to somebody else
[1:08:54] somebody else will take your place
[1:08:57] wait a minute does everybody believe
[1:08:59] brother Brown was a prophet
[1:09:00] okay then we believe this quote right
[1:09:02] okay I just want to make sure I wasn't
[1:09:04] in another group
[1:09:05] second Samuel 22 verse 33 says God is my
[1:09:08] strength and power
[1:09:09] he maketh my way perfect now we're
[1:09:13] heading toward godliness all right
[1:09:15] Philippians 2 verse 15 that you may be
[1:09:18] what blameless harmless the sons of God
[1:09:22] without rebuke
[1:09:24] wow in the midst of a crooked and
[1:09:26] perverse Nation
[1:09:28] among whom you shine
[1:09:31] as lights in the world
[1:09:34] this is the darkest world ever been and
[1:09:36] you're a shining light in that Darkness
[1:09:38] Genesis 17 verse 1 says is when Abram
[1:09:41] was 90 years old and nine the Lord
[1:09:43] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[1:09:45] the almighty God walked before me and be
[1:09:48] thou
[1:09:49] perfect
[1:09:51] Abram had enough Faith to believe if God
[1:09:54] told him he was going to make him
[1:09:55] perfect God was going to have to do it
[1:09:59] but remember Abram made a mistake he
[1:10:01] went and he got a Hagar and he went and
[1:10:03] did this and he he was supposed to go by
[1:10:05] himself and he took lot with him he was
[1:10:07] supposed to have this child but now he
[1:10:09] didn't get the Revelation that it was
[1:10:10] through Sarah
[1:10:12] so he took Hagar so see he's making all
[1:10:14] kinds of mistakes but God what by
[1:10:16] foreknowledge he saw that Abraham would
[1:10:19] what endure and that he would have the
[1:10:21] child with Sarah all right same way with
[1:10:24] me and you now look perfect is one who
[1:10:27] lacks nothing in physical strength or
[1:10:28] beauty they're sound and wholesome
[1:10:31] that's what we're looking at the Statue
[1:10:32] of perfect man be therefore perfect even
[1:10:35] as your father in Heaven is perfect you
[1:10:36] know what Jesus said so Jesus was saying
[1:10:39] be thou sound or wholesome
[1:10:42] a quiet sort of person complete uh
[1:10:45] morally innocent having integrity
[1:10:49] one who is morally and ethnically pure
[1:10:51] that doesn't mean be therefore perfect
[1:10:53] and that God made Abram perfect and
[1:10:56] every day
[1:10:58] the sunshine
[1:11:01] the bills quit coming
[1:11:02] hello somebody
[1:11:04] my power bill just went up 40 50 a month
[1:11:07] I must be lost
[1:11:09] that's what people think no I don't mean
[1:11:11] nothing that means you need to turn your
[1:11:13] lights off
[1:11:14] keep sister Regina and
[1:11:17] okay anyway
[1:11:20] even in the Rapture even in the Rapture
[1:11:23] we're going to talk about y'all leaving
[1:11:24] the lights on in my house you and sister
[1:11:27] Trudy
[1:11:29] back there
[1:11:31] so anyway
[1:11:32] but that doesn't mean the brother Brown
[1:11:34] I love what he said though he said
[1:11:35] cloudy days didn't mean God was against
[1:11:37] you
[1:11:38] sunny days didn't mean it was for you
[1:11:40] either
[1:11:40] you can't the human things we were
[1:11:43] talking about last night the human
[1:11:44] things that we do are human things all
[1:11:48] right but remember what I told you what
[1:11:50] does the Holy Ghost do you're going to
[1:11:52] have problems you're going to have
[1:11:54] issues you're gonna have things in your
[1:11:56] life every day
[1:11:58] but with the Holy Ghost you will learn
[1:12:00] how to what suppress the fear yes
[1:12:03] yes cause you got something inside of
[1:12:05] you that's different from the world this
[1:12:09] world don't know what's going on they
[1:12:11] are fearful of everything
[1:12:14] that's why their heart
[1:12:16] is weak
[1:12:19] but if you're perfect you're morally and
[1:12:21] ethically pure
[1:12:23] if you have a problem you know how to
[1:12:25] handle it
[1:12:29] isn't that a great thing
[1:12:30] do we remember the time though when we
[1:12:32] were out floundering around the world
[1:12:33] and everything went went wrong where did
[1:12:35] we go we went to our intelligence hello
[1:12:38] somebody we went to our own intelligence
[1:12:41] our book
[1:12:43] you know a self-help book or you know
[1:12:46] let's go to psychiatrist it's okay if
[1:12:48] you go it's okay
[1:12:50] but you don't lean to that
[1:12:53] lean not to that of the world
[1:12:57] myself to God read the Bible
[1:12:59] and I will tell you what you are not
[1:13:01] what a Scots
[1:13:02] psychiatrist is going to tell you what
[1:13:04] you're going to be
[1:13:06] yeah God's already told you what you're
[1:13:07] going to be
[1:13:08] you're gonna be perfect established
[1:13:11] pure
[1:13:13] what Marley and ethically pure
[1:13:20] yeah I really appreciate it I'm going to
[1:13:21] give a star to who our star needs to go
[1:13:23] I appreciate
[1:13:25] the several weddings that we've seen
[1:13:28] the last few months including these
[1:13:30] sitting here and Lois and Lucas and Zach
[1:13:34] and Lily and and uh
[1:13:37] and like I said before
[1:13:41] purity
[1:13:47] something a lot of us can't brag about
[1:13:51] praise God they're some that can
[1:13:53] and praise God that there's somebody
[1:13:55] like Lois and Lucas were here last
[1:13:57] weekend
[1:13:58] that
[1:14:00] when I started to kiss they never kissed
[1:14:02] before it looked like two two-year-olds
[1:14:07] well praise the Lord I look at that as
[1:14:09] innocence now me that's very that's to
[1:14:11] me that's what God wants he wants you to
[1:14:13] be so innocent
[1:14:14] all right
[1:14:15] finally he got a peck on the cheek
[1:14:18] because they were trying to aim and you
[1:14:20] know it just ain't gonna happen
[1:14:22] but practice makes perfect I asked him
[1:14:24] the other week and I said y'all get that
[1:14:25] kissing thing down right they said we
[1:14:27] good
[1:14:30] but you know what that's the way with
[1:14:31] God
[1:14:32] when you get the new birth you're just a
[1:14:34] babe in Christ you're a new bride you
[1:14:36] don't know what's going on because
[1:14:37] you're innocent of that whether you've
[1:14:39] been scarred and marred in your human
[1:14:41] life but in the life of God if you've
[1:14:44] never been born again and then God burst
[1:14:46] you into the body of Christ you're a new
[1:14:48] Creator a creature a new creation you
[1:14:51] don't know about that you didn't know
[1:14:53] about all that
[1:14:55] but we do now we know we've come into
[1:14:57] purity
[1:14:59] he gave some Apostles prophets pastors
[1:15:01] teachers and evangelists
[1:15:03] for the perfecting
[1:15:05] of the Saints
[1:15:07] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:15:09] edifying
[1:15:10] of the body of Christ look till we all
[1:15:12] come into the unity of the faith
[1:15:14] and knowledge of the Son of God unto
[1:15:16] what a perfect man
[1:15:18] unto the measure of the stature that's
[1:15:20] what we're talking about stature of a
[1:15:21] perfect man of Christ
[1:15:23] that we hint for look that we hint for
[1:15:30] a b y'all got that kissing thing
[1:15:31] straightened out now like no we're still
[1:15:33] having problems
[1:15:34] there'd be an issue there no they had to
[1:15:36] straighten out they've been practicing
[1:15:39] that's what we need to do we need to
[1:15:41] practice with the Lord
[1:15:43] get our heart right do the things of our
[1:15:45] he's our lover
[1:15:47] we're married to him now there's a union
[1:15:51] that's undefiled
[1:15:55] well praise the Lord anyway that's what
[1:15:56] it is when you get born again you get
[1:15:58] married
[1:16:00] but you can't stand bride
[1:16:02] gotta be a wife
[1:16:06] that will henceforth be no more children
[1:16:08] tossed to and fro
[1:16:10] carried away with every wind of Doctrine
[1:16:12] by the slight of men and cutting
[1:16:14] craftedness whereby they lying weight to
[1:16:16] deceive as I said a couple of Sundays
[1:16:18] ago
[1:16:19] I don't want you to really think about
[1:16:21] this from that scripture you only really
[1:16:23] believe what you obey
[1:16:26] if you don't believe that church is
[1:16:28] important you ain't going to come and
[1:16:30] you're an unbeliever
[1:16:37] you don't believe what the Bible says
[1:16:39] we've got to start believing every word
[1:16:40] of the Bible not just the part see we
[1:16:42] like we like to uh we like our own
[1:16:45] favorite little quotes
[1:16:48] but why can't you take
[1:16:50] brother Dale used to bring us 30 and 40
[1:16:52] we're talking about the other day he'd
[1:16:53] bring us 30 and 40 quotes of service
[1:16:55] he covered that thing thoroughly he
[1:16:58] would he would take the ones that seemed
[1:16:59] like I said seem like contrary and make
[1:17:02] them fit the ones that we say is our
[1:17:04] Doctrine everybody with me on that all
[1:17:07] right we pick and choose what we want
[1:17:09] same way with the Bible well I'll serve
[1:17:11] you Lord I'll obey you because I believe
[1:17:13] this but I don't believe that all right
[1:17:15] when we come to Christianity we should
[1:17:18] believe the whole word of God not just
[1:17:20] part of it
[1:17:22] all right
[1:17:24] but if it's not your desire then that
[1:17:26] desire is not in you because I'll read
[1:17:28] here in just a few minutes brother Brown
[1:17:29] said if you've got the Holy Ghost you
[1:17:31] will do what the word says because it's
[1:17:33] the same person that wrote it is inside
[1:17:35] of you or he's not inside of you
[1:17:38] he's just anointing you oh
[1:17:43] because there's going to be somebody
[1:17:44] look carried away with every wind of
[1:17:46] Doctrine by the slide of men cunning
[1:17:48] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:17:49] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[1:17:52] May grow up into him and all things
[1:17:55] which is the head even Christ now that
[1:17:58] word perfecting means completely or
[1:18:01] complete Furnishing it doesn't mean that
[1:18:03] you're not going to stub your toe it's
[1:18:05] not going to mean that that tomorrow
[1:18:06] that I'm gonna walk in the dentist
[1:18:09] office and then five teeth that she's
[1:18:11] going to pull just automatically fall
[1:18:13] out
[1:18:14] I wish
[1:18:16] no they're attached to me and they're
[1:18:18] going to have to be pulled out because
[1:18:20] I'm a human
[1:18:21] all right
[1:18:22] by old age some of them's already come
[1:18:24] out
[1:18:25] that's why we're going to fix them but
[1:18:27] that doesn't mean one thing about you
[1:18:29] know if I if I go sit down tomorrow and
[1:18:32] she sticks that needle in my mouth
[1:18:35] and it hurts for a moment
[1:18:39] that don't mean I'm not a Christian oh
[1:18:40] bro wait you don't lost your
[1:18:42] Christianity you're hurting
[1:18:43] you know I lost your Christianity you
[1:18:45] can't get healed now I don't mean one
[1:18:46] thing nothing
[1:18:50] because you know what somebody get
[1:18:52] healed and not even be a child of God
[1:18:55] brother Brown says a prostitute can come
[1:18:57] to the platform get her healing and
[1:19:00] someone that's a child of God doesn't
[1:19:02] get their healing because they're
[1:19:03] thinking about I did this wrong I did
[1:19:05] that wrong that prostitute just walks to
[1:19:06] pray and says I believe what that man
[1:19:08] says
[1:19:09] so she gets her healing all right
[1:19:11] completely furnished or Furnishing or
[1:19:14] equipping in other words when something
[1:19:15] comes you know how to handle it
[1:19:18] when something comes your way there's a
[1:19:20] way that you can not get around it but
[1:19:23] get through it all right we don't try to
[1:19:25] go around things we go through them all
[1:19:27] right so now let's we come to Godliness
[1:19:30] let's look at this I want you to see
[1:19:31] something here
[1:19:32] that we didn't previously bring out but
[1:19:36] it's um it means Holiness reverence and
[1:19:39] respect piety towards God
[1:19:42] that is godliness all right and brother
[1:19:45] Brown tells us what to be like God all
[1:19:48] right
[1:19:49] so how are we going to be like God we
[1:19:51] got to have a pastor
[1:19:52] we gotta have a five-fold Ministry
[1:19:54] you can't press play and become perfect
[1:19:57] I am so sorry
[1:20:01] nobody gonna amen that
[1:20:04] listen that's a fallacy that is a that
[1:20:07] is a
[1:20:09] um
[1:20:10] evil spirit because it's not a spirit
[1:20:12] that comes from God
[1:20:14] all right
[1:20:16] and without controversy great is a
[1:20:19] mystery of godliness as we were talking
[1:20:20] about before God was manifesting the
[1:20:22] flesh oh by the way we know that 2000
[1:20:24] years ago Jesus was manifested in flesh
[1:20:26] what about today amen
[1:20:28] you are not wood
[1:20:34] and Bricks
[1:20:36] and Martyr
[1:20:37] God one time dwelled in that
[1:20:41] called a tabernacle
[1:20:43] he done away with that Tabernacle and
[1:20:45] now he's inside of me and you
[1:20:52] now let's read this real quick
[1:20:54] second Peter 1 verse three this is part
[1:20:56] of what we've been reading so I'm going
[1:20:57] to back up and read it according as his
[1:20:59] divine power hath given unto who
[1:21:03] all things that pertaining to life and
[1:21:06] godliness so they start you a perfect
[1:21:07] man this teaching of we've been a
[1:21:09] hundred and something sermons is I hope
[1:21:11] it's helped us even in life
[1:21:14] even to make our life better
[1:21:16] and even if it was just a little bit
[1:21:19] unto life and godliness
[1:21:22] grow up in God through the knowledge of
[1:21:25] him that had called us to glory and
[1:21:27] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:21:28] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:21:31] that by these
[1:21:32] you might be partakers of what
[1:21:35] there's only one divine nature that's
[1:21:38] God
[1:21:40] that's deity
[1:21:43] everybody with me
[1:21:45] oh that's deity that's something way up
[1:21:47] there by the way that's something he's
[1:21:49] deity that's God
[1:21:50] yep I know that but let's see what the
[1:21:53] prophet said about that
[1:21:55] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:21:57] the world through lust and besides this
[1:21:59] besides this divine nature
[1:22:02] giving all diligence ad and that's what
[1:22:04] we've been doing for 100 sermons we've
[1:22:06] been adding The Virtue add knowledge add
[1:22:08] Temperance add patience and add
[1:22:10] godliness and then we'll head to
[1:22:12] brotherly kindness so let's look and see
[1:22:14] what deity means a deity is something in
[1:22:19] other words Supernatural
[1:22:21] all right
[1:22:22] the shaping of Western Christianity all
[1:22:24] Western Christianity is shaped around a
[1:22:28] deity Now by with me all right Shake
[1:22:30] Yourself for a minute we're still got an
[1:22:32] hour to go
[1:22:35] I'm gonna get to a place all right the
[1:22:37] word deity means divine Adventure now
[1:22:40] hope back up here
[1:22:42] what God tell us we might be what
[1:22:45] partakers of the divine nature what is
[1:22:49] divine nature
[1:22:52] the word deity means divine nature I
[1:22:55] didn't come up with this I got it off
[1:22:56] the internet must be true
[1:22:59] it was coined by Saint Augustine a
[1:23:02] theologian whose writings were very
[1:23:04] influential in the shaping of the
[1:23:05] western Christianity deity comes from
[1:23:07] the Latin word for God deals all right
[1:23:10] the divine nature of deities is believed
[1:23:13] to be immortal goodness and powerfulness
[1:23:17] or it's a noun that says any
[1:23:19] supernatural being well listen we got to
[1:23:22] know who deity is
[1:23:24] I want you to listen to this it's going
[1:23:25] to be a long quote but I'm going to read
[1:23:26] it anyways everybody all right Shake
[1:23:28] Yourself
[1:23:29] he swore by himself now listen this is
[1:23:31] 1954. this is Brother Brown I'm
[1:23:33] preaching in the early part of his
[1:23:35] ministry the little corn that come up
[1:23:37] here now look stop just a minute what
[1:23:40] are we heading toward we're heading
[1:23:42] toward the seed that went in the ground
[1:23:45] to grow
[1:23:48] and become seed again
[1:23:50] he's coming after seed he's not coming
[1:23:53] after plants
[1:23:55] he's coming after himself he's coming
[1:23:57] after seed
[1:23:59] which is what maturity
[1:24:01] you don't eat corn when it's like this
[1:24:03] or even like this or even when it
[1:24:05] tassels
[1:24:06] you wait till it matures
[1:24:08] then you can eat corn and then you can
[1:24:10] take that corn and you can dry it out
[1:24:12] take that seed if it's if it's heirloom
[1:24:15] not this junk they got now but you can
[1:24:17] take that seed and next year you can put
[1:24:19] it in the ground and guess what it'll do
[1:24:20] it'll produce two or three years of corn
[1:24:23] all right that's what God is wanting to
[1:24:25] do now
[1:24:26] he's wanting us to come to the divine
[1:24:28] nature come to maturity so that we can
[1:24:30] produce more seed
[1:24:32] more of him
[1:24:34] so here's brother Brown's thought now in
[1:24:36] that thought listen
[1:24:38] the little corn that come up here the
[1:24:40] first thing the farmer looked and seen
[1:24:42] these little Sprouts sticking up
[1:24:43] wonderful he rejoiced after a while they
[1:24:46] got old and withered away and the corn
[1:24:48] went on
[1:24:50] in it the same life that was in this
[1:24:52] corn down here
[1:24:56] down here
[1:24:58] is the same life that's going to be up
[1:25:00] here it's just going to be more of it
[1:25:04] more mature in it the same life that was
[1:25:07] in this corn down here at the first
[1:25:08] stock is in it up here and then
[1:25:13] they just went on and on and on so is
[1:25:16] the church growing on that perfect day
[1:25:19] when Jesus shall come
[1:25:20] same Holy Spirit same thing just
[1:25:24] different dispensation what is our
[1:25:26] dispensation rapture
[1:25:29] body change getting out of here
[1:25:32] that's our dispensation we're not a
[1:25:35] dispensation of justification anymore
[1:25:39] full grain full corn full maturity
[1:25:44] that's a requirement all right to
[1:25:46] graduate it's a requirement part of the
[1:25:48] curriculum so if you're going to
[1:25:49] graduate in the end time
[1:25:51] Gotta Have It All right just different
[1:25:54] dispensation now in moving of this look
[1:25:57] take the heifers the goats everything
[1:25:58] must be three years old the three
[1:26:00] different dispensations
[1:26:01] fatherhood sonship Holy Spirit
[1:26:06] see three years everything was three
[1:26:09] years met father son Holy Spirit same
[1:26:11] God it was under that dispensation is
[1:26:14] under this dispensation under that
[1:26:16] dispensation and will always will be the
[1:26:19] same only one God three dispensations
[1:26:21] not three Gods three dispensations of
[1:26:24] the same God all right
[1:26:26] the same God was in the pillar of Fire
[1:26:29] was in Christ Jesus right the same one
[1:26:33] in Christ Jesus didn't go into you
[1:26:38] oh I'm sorry let's read that again the
[1:26:41] same one in Christ Jesus in you
[1:26:45] that's right God in you
[1:26:48] the hope of glory
[1:26:50] is that right the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:53] Spirit dwelling in the person now you
[1:26:55] become what sons of God
[1:26:58] when God condescended and overshadowed
[1:27:01] Virgin Mary he was alive and a life
[1:27:04] overshadowed and created a blood cell
[1:27:06] around itself anyone knows now that the
[1:27:10] blood cell comes from what comes from
[1:27:11] the male is that right the life lays in
[1:27:14] the blood cell and the blood cell is
[1:27:16] coming from the male not to female we
[1:27:18] know that all right there's where the
[1:27:20] life is is in the male sperm notice then
[1:27:24] God himself not a second person third
[1:27:27] person the person God himself came into
[1:27:31] the womb of Mary he went from this great
[1:27:34] God that brother Ralph tells us in in
[1:27:37] several sermons and we we we preach it
[1:27:39] where brother Brown says he covered all
[1:27:42] space time in eternity you couldn't
[1:27:44] comprehend this eternal God
[1:27:46] then you see a little Halo of light
[1:27:49] then you see a person standing there
[1:27:51] then you see a world coming into
[1:27:52] existence
[1:27:55] he went right back down
[1:27:58] to a cell that you can't see it's set
[1:28:00] with a microscope
[1:28:04] you think it's somebody different
[1:28:06] no
[1:28:08] that's what we were talking about last
[1:28:09] night I I just don't see where people
[1:28:11] can see that God that Jesus wasn't God
[1:28:13] to the River Jordan well he had to be
[1:28:14] somebody when he was born
[1:28:17] God God
[1:28:20] he was gone when he was born
[1:28:23] it was God when he died he said oh God
[1:28:25] can't die no you can't either
[1:28:28] the inside man came but the outside man
[1:28:30] sure can
[1:28:31] then God himself came into the womb of
[1:28:33] Mary and wrapped himself in a created
[1:28:36] blood cell
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:39] the reason we have eternal life that
[1:28:42] when that blood cell because of sin was
[1:28:44] pierced with a sword Yonder and broke in
[1:28:47] other words at Calvary it freed God
[1:28:49] Yonder and he broke open the blood cell
[1:28:52] and watched us
[1:28:55] and brought us into himself by the Holy
[1:28:58] Spirit I want you to know what the Holy
[1:28:59] Ghost is today I want you to really see
[1:29:01] one somebody was asked last night do you
[1:29:04] know if you got it well just let's just
[1:29:06] keep reading let's let brother random
[1:29:07] explain it all right there you are and
[1:29:10] now we are sons of God part of God
[1:29:14] not part of the second person of the
[1:29:16] Trinity not part of the third person of
[1:29:19] the Trinity you're part of the creator
[1:29:22] deity itself lives in every believer
[1:29:28] every man that's born of the spirit of
[1:29:31] God is a part of God
[1:29:33] no wonder he believes in the
[1:29:36] Supernatural
[1:29:38] see no wonder I can stand here and I
[1:29:41] could go up into every Hall at the
[1:29:44] hospital up there and say God Is A
[1:29:46] Healer I don't care whether they believe
[1:29:47] me or not
[1:29:48] I believe it
[1:29:50] yeah
[1:29:52] no wonder he can believe in anything
[1:29:54] why is it in him is a portion of God
[1:29:59] wrapped up in your moral body
[1:30:05] with their sin
[1:30:07] and everything else
[1:30:12] has created
[1:30:13] that body that's inside of you
[1:30:17] outside of me then now watch but down in
[1:30:19] there I want you to see this terminology
[1:30:23] some work of God Alone in regeneration
[1:30:28] you can't do it your mama can't do it
[1:30:30] your daddy can't do it I can't do it
[1:30:32] nobody can do it but God himself there's
[1:30:34] only way the only way that you're going
[1:30:36] to get born again is God himself
[1:30:39] comes down and cleans you up by regening
[1:30:42] you or giving you a regeneration
[1:30:47] give you another mom and a daddy
[1:30:49] hello somebody don't get quiet on me
[1:30:52] some work of God Alone in regen he does
[1:30:55] that for you
[1:30:56] he doesn't do it in a collective body
[1:31:00] and the quietness of your closet maybe
[1:31:02] he did it maybe he did it here maybe he
[1:31:04] did it in a camper somewhere
[1:31:06] right here
[1:31:08] motor home
[1:31:11] you got birth somewhere
[1:31:13] or either you're getting it or either
[1:31:15] you didn't get birthed at all
[1:31:18] but if you are at Birth today this is
[1:31:20] what God did
[1:31:22] some work of God alone and regeneration
[1:31:24] has come down through there what through
[1:31:26] this
[1:31:30] by the shedding of his blood and taking
[1:31:33] away that blood that was in there as a
[1:31:36] way set it aside
[1:31:40] set it aside
[1:31:41] got rid of it
[1:31:43] pushed it out of the way
[1:31:46] and entered into this sinful man and put
[1:31:50] in him a hope that he'd die for it's
[1:31:53] just as freely as he's standing there
[1:31:57] speak to him sure he believes him let's
[1:31:59] continue this long quote Jesus said
[1:32:00] these signs shall follow them that
[1:32:02] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:32:05] Devils speak with new tongues take up
[1:32:07] serpent drink deadly things or lay hands
[1:32:09] on the sick they shall recover this is
[1:32:11] not just for the preachers
[1:32:13] praise the Lord
[1:32:15] Jesus said that why he's become a part
[1:32:19] of him
[1:32:20] yes sir God's on the instance of deliver
[1:32:25] anything
[1:32:27] he'll make a way
[1:32:29] when there's no way
[1:32:31] he makes a way
[1:32:34] and any man that believes in Him
[1:32:36] believes the same thing
[1:32:39] listen if God never heals another person
[1:32:43] I still believe the Healer
[1:32:46] I mean we we want to just you know the
[1:32:49] Bible says lay hands on a sickness shall
[1:32:50] recover them we all we have all these
[1:32:52] promises yet when we say brother Michael
[1:32:54] does something you know he hurts his leg
[1:32:56] or something he walks up here he wobbles
[1:32:57] up here and you know we pray for him and
[1:32:58] we just as human beings we in our
[1:33:01] thought process
[1:33:03] it's like man
[1:33:04] he's gonna walk back through there and
[1:33:06] he's not going to limp
[1:33:08] he gets prayed for and here you go
[1:33:12] now what does that do to your faith
[1:33:15] it should never make it weaker
[1:33:19] because he said lay hands on a sick and
[1:33:21] they shall now we welcome
[1:33:24] every time
[1:33:25] everybody
[1:33:27] microwave Society here we are
[1:33:29] yeah no we're Crock-Pot Christians
[1:33:32] it's a slow thing
[1:33:36] and maybe any man that believes in Him
[1:33:38] believes the same thing he has to
[1:33:41] now look brother Brown's going to turn
[1:33:42] the screws as we always say he's going
[1:33:44] to tighten them up here right now
[1:33:46] he's a part of God
[1:33:47] he's an offspring of God he's a Son of
[1:33:50] God or a daughter of God and he can't do
[1:33:52] nothing else
[1:33:54] because God's right with him he's just a
[1:33:57] portion of God
[1:34:00] look everything that God was in a pillar
[1:34:03] of Fire
[1:34:04] he emptied into the sun
[1:34:06] Jesus Christ in him throughout the
[1:34:08] fullness of the godhead bodily is that
[1:34:10] right
[1:34:11] the Bible said that God g.o.d himself
[1:34:13] Jehovah the mighty one the Buckle of The
[1:34:15] Shield all his Redemptive names
[1:34:18] everything that he was he emptied into
[1:34:20] Christ Jesus
[1:34:22] yeah bye with me
[1:34:23] and Jesus Christ formed from a blood
[1:34:26] cell
[1:34:27] and the outside Shield of the cell
[1:34:30] itself which was billions times billions
[1:34:33] smaller than a human eye could see but
[1:34:35] that was the body of the Lord
[1:34:38] how about with me that's the the Natural
[1:34:40] Body of Jesus
[1:34:41] instead of that was God himself
[1:34:45] wrapped himself around the blood cell in
[1:34:47] orders to take his own blood spill his
[1:34:50] own blood or give it freely that we
[1:34:53] through the breaking of that blood cell
[1:34:55] to our mortal when it breaks and our
[1:34:59] life leads from here and goes out to the
[1:35:00] Redemption of the blood that God
[1:35:01] required we can be brought into that
[1:35:04] body and become a part of God himself as
[1:35:07] a son of God
[1:35:08] yeah bye with me
[1:35:09] brother if you can digest that it'll
[1:35:12] sure do you some good
[1:35:13] I wish I had some way just to show you
[1:35:16] what it is just think of god Jehovah
[1:35:18] look coming down into the womb of a
[1:35:19] woman
[1:35:20] this great big God that created
[1:35:22] everything
[1:35:24] he got into a sperm cell
[1:35:26] went into the womb of Mary
[1:35:30] he created the egg
[1:35:31] and sperm placed it in Mary by
[1:35:35] Immaculate Conception no no feelings or
[1:35:38] emotions of either one
[1:35:41] but that was God
[1:35:43] that was him making his own body
[1:35:45] man couldn't make him a body
[1:35:47] because it'd be sinful
[1:35:49] he made his own body
[1:35:51] but look folks he's making his own body
[1:35:52] now
[1:35:54] he's making his own body right now we
[1:35:56] take oh that's two thousand years ago
[1:35:57] listen that baby grew up
[1:36:00] went through trials and tribulations
[1:36:01] died for me and you came back on the
[1:36:04] dead Pentecost and I hope and believe is
[1:36:05] inside of us
[1:36:09] coming down into the womb of a woman
[1:36:11] overshadowed come down in the down to
[1:36:14] Spirit and he's in there what is he he's
[1:36:17] the Creator himself
[1:36:19] he made the very woman in the womb that
[1:36:22] he was in yes
[1:36:24] made that woman
[1:36:27] who Mary
[1:36:29] God made himself little came down and
[1:36:31] got into this blood cell and began to
[1:36:33] build something around him what was it
[1:36:36] see what caused this thing back there at
[1:36:38] the beginning blood blood life was in
[1:36:40] the blood and back there's what caused
[1:36:42] it in the beginning now take it away God
[1:36:44] himself has to come down and he made
[1:36:46] himself real little
[1:36:48] come into the womb of Mary and created
[1:36:50] it around himself look a wall
[1:36:53] human flesh a wall which was the blood
[1:36:56] cell no man known nothing about it
[1:36:58] created this blood cell that blood cell
[1:37:00] pushed to another another
[1:37:04] one and all the nerves and everything
[1:37:06] began to come together and God himself
[1:37:09] living in this making a tabernacle and
[1:37:11] he dwelt in Christ
[1:37:13] there's God walking around he said I am
[1:37:15] my father are one my father is in me he
[1:37:18] said show us now the father Philip said
[1:37:19] show me the father and it'll satisfy us
[1:37:21] Philip have I been so long with him and
[1:37:23] you don't know me he said when you see
[1:37:25] me you see the father
[1:37:28] when people see you in your daily walk
[1:37:30] do they see
[1:37:32] the father
[1:37:34] or your natural father
[1:37:36] and when you see me you see the father
[1:37:38] and why I say show me the father I am
[1:37:40] the father of one my father's living in
[1:37:43] me now it's not me that doeth the work
[1:37:45] just him that dwell within me that does
[1:37:46] the works oh my
[1:37:50] now listen listen that's what brother
[1:37:51] Brown said how can I tell a man what's
[1:37:53] wrong with him
[1:37:54] how can I tell him what his future will
[1:37:57] be in 10 years
[1:37:59] are what he was 40 years ago
[1:38:03] it isn't me Hallelujah
[1:38:06] it's him that lives in me
[1:38:09] that come down that through his blood
[1:38:11] brought me in fellowship with him
[1:38:14] hallelujah how could my hands do
[1:38:16] anything by Healing The Sick hasn't got
[1:38:19] a bit of power it's not me but it's him
[1:38:21] that dwells in here that does it
[1:38:25] he's pointing to somebody how can this
[1:38:27] man preach the gospel
[1:38:29] he can't preach no gospel there's
[1:38:31] nothing in him to do it with
[1:38:34] wow
[1:38:36] he's a sinner by Nature but God came
[1:38:39] down and dwelt in and made him a Son of
[1:38:41] God and he preached the gospel why does
[1:38:44] he believe the word because the very God
[1:38:47] that made the word is preaching right
[1:38:49] through him
[1:38:53] the very God that made the word that's
[1:38:55] why if you got the word inside of you
[1:38:56] you can't deny the word
[1:38:58] we were talking about last night if you
[1:39:01] deny the word of God which is now the
[1:39:03] message of the hour in its pure form if
[1:39:07] you turn that down and say it's it's not
[1:39:09] true it's false then there's just no
[1:39:11] hope for you folks you just didn't get
[1:39:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:39:15] but now listen you can also be in this
[1:39:18] message for 40 years and get a gold star
[1:39:20] and die and go to hell
[1:39:24] because the very God that made the word
[1:39:26] is preaching right through him
[1:39:29] how did I see it do you see it there it
[1:39:32] is the very God that wrote the word is
[1:39:35] in the man saying that's the truth
[1:39:39] that's what you're doing today some of
[1:39:41] you
[1:39:43] are saying amen
[1:39:45] because the guy that wrote what I'm
[1:39:47] telling you about is inside of you
[1:39:48] quickening
[1:39:50] and that's the process of saying amen
[1:39:55] that's the truth I don't care what
[1:39:57] anybody says that's the truth there it
[1:39:59] is God in the man look God and the man
[1:40:02] recognizes his own word
[1:40:05] that settled it God in here believe all
[1:40:10] things hope all things endure all things
[1:40:11] is that right all the scriptures
[1:40:13] inspired of God God wrote it when God
[1:40:16] comes in here God recognizes his own
[1:40:19] word and says sure that's the truth
[1:40:22] a believer
[1:40:24] now you go to doctoring it up somewhere
[1:40:26] that's between you and God but God
[1:40:29] recognizes his own word
[1:40:32] oh how that makes us feel God's inspired
[1:40:36] word listen to this Faith the substance
[1:40:38] the things hoped for 1951 and the Very
[1:40:40] God back there in the beginning that
[1:40:42] role the world the
[1:40:43] stars and made them from things which
[1:40:45] didn't appear or made them out of things
[1:40:47] that do appear
[1:40:48] and where did he get the material to
[1:40:50] make it he spoke it into existence by
[1:40:52] his word he said let there be and it was
[1:40:54] so watch deity
[1:40:58] and that a portion of that deity dwells
[1:41:01] in the heart of every born-again
[1:41:03] Christian
[1:41:06] that's my brother Brown could say you're
[1:41:07] a little creator
[1:41:09] then what did he say ask what you will
[1:41:12] it'll be given to you there you are
[1:41:14] deity fell on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:18] it's still falling now
[1:41:24] and men are regenerated made a new
[1:41:27] person sealed into the kingdom of God by
[1:41:29] the Holy Spirit The Life of Christ
[1:41:31] pressed into them
[1:41:33] all their drinking immoral habits and
[1:41:35] everything go out the love of God is
[1:41:38] like a notary public
[1:41:39] I happen to be one sister Rebecca is too
[1:41:41] takes a seal and what we do is we press
[1:41:44] the seal we we get certified number one
[1:41:46] then we make sure we're not criminals
[1:41:49] ourselves and we and we see put a seal
[1:41:51] on it that signifies that what that
[1:41:54] paper says that's what it is
[1:41:56] and then the person that signed it
[1:41:59] so now look it presses it until the
[1:42:03] inscription of the seal is pressed in
[1:42:06] the paper
[1:42:08] over the signature oh my when Christ
[1:42:11] signs your name on The Book of Life and
[1:42:13] the Holy Spirit presses it in there
[1:42:15] until the Life of Christ is formed in
[1:42:17] you becomes deity
[1:42:21] resurrection of Lazarus look deity I'm a
[1:42:24] part of Charles Brandon because I was
[1:42:26] born from Charles Brown or my daddy
[1:42:28] and I'm a part of him I've got a
[1:42:30] forehead like him my hair is like him
[1:42:32] I'm a small man like him I'm in the
[1:42:34] nature like him because he's my dad
[1:42:36] listen when cats get together they have
[1:42:38] what cats
[1:42:40] dogs get together they have dogs horses
[1:42:44] get together they have horses man and
[1:42:47] woman gets together they have humans
[1:42:50] when man
[1:42:52] gives itself to God and lets God in you
[1:42:56] become
[1:42:59] God
[1:43:04] and if we become in the spirit sons of
[1:43:06] God deity dwells in the man
[1:43:09] then you talk about blind eyes being
[1:43:11] open
[1:43:12] they said nothing impossible to God God
[1:43:14] said nothing impossible with you
[1:43:17] let me read that one more time they said
[1:43:20] nothing is impossible to God right
[1:43:22] that's what the Bible says God said
[1:43:25] there's nothing impossible with you if
[1:43:28] you'll believe not with God but you
[1:43:31] deities in man
[1:43:33] the very God that stood back in the
[1:43:35] mythical platform of the eternities and
[1:43:38] rolled worlds off of his hands and
[1:43:40] created these things give you the
[1:43:42] privilege to be a son
[1:43:44] and you're a part of him God dwells in
[1:43:47] mankind and him himself man himself is
[1:43:50] deity Hallelujah there you are it might
[1:43:53] choke you but study over it a little
[1:43:54] while
[1:43:55] he is God dwells in man and man becomes
[1:43:58] the Son of God not him and himself but
[1:44:00] the Holy Spirit that's in him is God
[1:44:02] the Creator lives in the creation oh my
[1:44:05] how I think of that then stand with an
[1:44:07] unwavering faith
[1:44:09] you got something today stand with an
[1:44:12] unwavering faith and ask what you will
[1:44:14] it'll be done unto you there he is God
[1:44:16] there he is
[1:44:18] inside of me and you
[1:44:23] and you know why
[1:44:24] if they hated him when he was on Earth
[1:44:26] deity in human flesh they're going to
[1:44:29] hate you
[1:44:31] this world is going to come to and and
[1:44:33] most of it listen anybody that's that's
[1:44:36] not born again is going to hate you
[1:44:38] eventually oh yeah they you're good
[1:44:42] you just strike them somewhere
[1:44:44] you know hit home somewhere preach the
[1:44:47] word to him
[1:44:48] tell them the truth
[1:44:51] you'll see Jesus told them the truth and
[1:44:53] they killed him for saying he was God
[1:44:56] they're going to kill me and you even
[1:44:58] our influence by saying oh you're some
[1:45:01] special God person Hallelujah
[1:45:04] let the world know
[1:45:07] that if God lives inside of this flesh
[1:45:09] it is deity
[1:45:12] it is God according to John 1 1 God was
[1:45:16] put in flesh
[1:45:18] and dwelt among the world
[1:45:20] you shall be hated of all men for my
[1:45:23] name's sake
[1:45:24] but he that endureth to the end
[1:45:26] shall be saved
[1:45:28] that word endureth means What Remain
[1:45:31] abide not recede or flee that's what we
[1:45:33] were talking about yesterday you know
[1:45:35] you see people come
[1:45:37] and and you hate it because you want you
[1:45:39] want everybody to see the word of God
[1:45:41] you want everybody to see you they want
[1:45:42] everybody to have what you got all right
[1:45:44] okay but you see some coming and you see
[1:45:46] them disappear well when they disappear
[1:45:52] something happened
[1:45:54] endureth means to remain abide not
[1:45:57] recede or flee
[1:46:00] start preaching the gospel real hard
[1:46:02] what happens
[1:46:04] people hit the door not because Janine
[1:46:06] just went out and Aaron come here
[1:46:08] walking in the family back there that I
[1:46:11] didn't mean that you understand you know
[1:46:13] what I'm talking about though
[1:46:14] I mean honestly you said you we're gonna
[1:46:16] have communion today we're not we had
[1:46:18] communion last Sunday but we're gonna
[1:46:19] have communion today everybody's

[1:46:32] why
[1:46:34] you tell me why you can call me you can
[1:46:37] you can call me whatever you want to
[1:46:38] call me but something's wrong in their
[1:46:40] life
[1:46:41] because that's an institution that God
[1:46:43] said all Christians should do
[1:46:46] right
[1:46:47] so don't get mad at me
[1:46:51] but you head out that back door then
[1:46:53] what there's something not right inside
[1:46:55] of you
[1:46:58] well let's get it right that's all I
[1:47:00] want I want to I don't I don't condemn
[1:47:02] them people I pray for them
[1:47:04] if you don't participate
[1:47:06] that's your business
[1:47:09] but you're showing just like water
[1:47:11] baptism just like today Luke's going to
[1:47:13] show the world
[1:47:16] I wish sin no I don't like CNN Fox could
[1:47:20] be here whatever I wouldn't care show
[1:47:22] the whole world that we're going to
[1:47:23] baptize our brother in the name of the
[1:47:25] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:47:27] his sin and he shall receive the gift of
[1:47:29] the Holy Ghost if he continues on
[1:47:30] everybody with me I'm not ashamed of
[1:47:33] that
[1:47:34] baptize them anywhere anytime I go up in
[1:47:36] them we'll go up to Northeast Georgia
[1:47:39] Medical Center and I'll baptize him in
[1:47:42] that new Fountain they got up there
[1:47:46] if you walk into North Tower it runs
[1:47:48] down the side of the wall you know it's
[1:47:49] going to be hard to get it but you can
[1:47:50] do it
[1:47:52] you can get them baptized I don't care
[1:47:53] don't mind
[1:47:55] but those who endured in the end in
[1:47:57] other words endure my teaching and
[1:47:59] endure my preaching and do it by
[1:48:00] preaching brother now enjoy it
[1:48:04] Aaron Louise I'm not going to discluding
[1:48:06] anybody
[1:48:08] you too Michael
[1:48:13] does a good job downstairs
[1:48:16] God's got a hold of that young man
[1:48:18] and I'm really proud of him
[1:48:20] I'll give you a rose now
[1:48:23] [Applause]
[1:48:29] but those who endure to the end
[1:48:32] the end to which all things relate the
[1:48:35] aim or the purpose
[1:48:38] those who endure to the end
[1:48:41] shall be saved
[1:48:44] when you receive a body change as
[1:48:46] brother Dale's always told us when you
[1:48:48] take a body change you can say I am
[1:48:51] truly born again
[1:48:55] but less endure
[1:48:57] let's endure to the end
[1:49:00] and that don't make now let when it says
[1:49:02] endure that don't mean flowery bed of
[1:49:04] ease that don't mean the bed is going to
[1:49:05] be soft that don't mean that that the
[1:49:07] Thorns are not going to stick your
[1:49:08] finger if you stick your hand in a rose
[1:49:10] bush
[1:49:12] okay
[1:49:15] but it does mean that
[1:49:17] you got something inside of you that can
[1:49:18] help take the edge off of that fear and
[1:49:21] off of that uncertainty this world is
[1:49:24] full of uncertainty and and and
[1:49:25] literally we don't know what's going to
[1:49:27] next we do I'm not like the world
[1:49:30] they've got the people that said over
[1:49:31] here and they say this is going to
[1:49:32] happen you know they ain't got the
[1:49:33] people over here that say this is going
[1:49:35] to happen we're going to go by you know
[1:49:36] we were going to all go to Bitcoin now
[1:49:38] bitcoin's gonna fell apart we're gonna
[1:49:40] go over to this one now this one fell
[1:49:41] apart well we're going to go to the
[1:49:43] Dollar well the Dollar's fixing to fall
[1:49:44] apart
[1:49:46] God will never
[1:49:48] Fall Apart
[1:49:50] so we can put our dependency that God if
[1:49:52] we put ourselves in Christ
[1:49:54] that he'll give us
[1:49:56] what we need let's read this real quick
[1:49:58] and then we'll close and we're not
[1:49:59] getting anywhere but we got to Godliness
[1:50:01] anyway but godliness is deity living
[1:50:04] inside of you and remember when you get
[1:50:06] born again that is deity living inside
[1:50:09] of you but you have taken that little
[1:50:12] baby and put a baby inside of you
[1:50:15] because you're a newborn what babe in
[1:50:18] Christ
[1:50:19] you got to grow you got what lay it out
[1:50:22] you got to teach it send it to school
[1:50:27] it'd be horrible if you took
[1:50:30] um somebody a baby and never let it
[1:50:32] never never let it go to school I know
[1:50:34] we homeschooling different things but
[1:50:35] I'm talking about just don't teach you
[1:50:36] nothing
[1:50:37] oh what kind of horrible thing would you
[1:50:40] have
[1:50:42] we got all these kids now that are young
[1:50:45] adults that's learning how to drive
[1:50:51] Levi do you have to give him a muscle
[1:50:53] car
[1:50:58] he goes that way towards Jefferson home
[1:51:00] that way
[1:51:01] we go don't we
[1:51:05] but you know what we all now listen and
[1:51:07] there's an example here we got Daddy God
[1:51:11] sure he's never worried
[1:51:13] but you're worried
[1:51:15] you're worried that you can't drive that
[1:51:17] car
[1:51:18] right
[1:51:19] how many of us have went to the drivers
[1:51:21] to to the to the driver's service to
[1:51:23] take your driver's test and you're like
[1:51:27] got this man
[1:51:32] Only You Marca
[1:51:37] okay
[1:51:38] but he drought he used to drive an Idaho
[1:51:40] where there's four people lives in the
[1:51:42] whole state so
[1:51:46] there's more there's more potatoes than
[1:51:47] there are people in that
[1:51:53] because we didn't know
[1:51:55] we it's but look we had studied
[1:51:58] and I'm gonna ask how many failed our
[1:52:00] tests the first time so
[1:52:03] but
[1:52:04] how many of you failed a test of life
[1:52:07] more than one time
[1:52:09] but you know what God's standing there
[1:52:10] going hey it's okay
[1:52:12] and then now
[1:52:14] you know insurance companies will tell
[1:52:16] you that number one men are worse
[1:52:20] drivers than women
[1:52:21] right
[1:52:24] that's what I said but
[1:52:29] you're sitting right back there
[1:52:32] on average
[1:52:34] why because we'd like to drive fast
[1:52:39] we like amen he said we like to you know
[1:52:42] take a thrill
[1:52:45] the girl's like I don't know if I want
[1:52:46] to do that or not so the insurance
[1:52:48] company says that we guys are our
[1:52:50] insurance is going to be higher because
[1:52:52] we're more prone to driving fast and
[1:52:55] having accidents and and all that stuff
[1:52:57] okay well same way with God
[1:53:00] he knows that we as human beings some of
[1:53:03] us are going to be train wrecks to begin
[1:53:05] with OR car wrecks but it does give us
[1:53:08] assurance
[1:53:11] not insurance he gives us assurance that
[1:53:14] if we make it through that trial
[1:53:16] that will get to be a better driver
[1:53:19] and we'll drive like
[1:53:21] 30 in a
[1:53:23] 70.
[1:53:26] as we get older
[1:53:28] but we're more cautious and that's what
[1:53:30] happens in the word of God we become
[1:53:31] more cautious and we become more
[1:53:34] um we become more you know I was taking
[1:53:36] a test
[1:53:38] to get my CDL this was back
[1:53:41] early 90s and um
[1:53:44] the guy from Fieldale was giving me the
[1:53:46] test and and with it would be easier
[1:53:48] because we knew them
[1:53:50] and so we're driving along and I turned
[1:53:53] down this road and the guy says okay I
[1:53:54] said what's the weight limit on this
[1:53:56] road
[1:53:58] I had studied
[1:54:00] I knew all my sign markers I knew how to
[1:54:05] look under the engine and find the
[1:54:07] manifold and find the uh the brakes and
[1:54:11] find because they're air brakes so you
[1:54:12] have air brakes and Ryan knows what I'm
[1:54:14] talking about
[1:54:15] you have all these different things you
[1:54:16] got to study
[1:54:18] I drove right past that sign
[1:54:21] never even paid attention to it but
[1:54:23] every road if you'll notice now every
[1:54:26] road there's a major road has a weight
[1:54:29] limit sign
[1:54:31] well you didn't know that that's why I'm
[1:54:33] preaching today because there's a lot of
[1:54:34] things you didn't know okay life lesson
[1:54:37] 473.
[1:54:39] there's a sign that says and it tells
[1:54:41] you that you can go down here if you're
[1:54:43] six wheel right on your right six wheel
[1:54:45] eight wheel ten wheel and it's got them
[1:54:48] out 25 000 pound gross weight limit 50
[1:54:51] 000 pound gross weight it's on it's on
[1:54:53] every Road
[1:54:54] I didn't know that until the dry until
[1:54:57] the instructor
[1:54:58] the Holy Ghost said hey you missed that
[1:55:00] sign
[1:55:02] you missed that sign
[1:55:03] you missed what that brother was
[1:55:05] preaching
[1:55:07] but you know what happened now
[1:55:09] even now 30 years later
[1:55:13] I can just about to tell you wherever
[1:55:15] sign is
[1:55:16] because as soon as I turned down the
[1:55:18] road I look to the right and there's
[1:55:19] that white sign that says the weight
[1:55:21] limit gross weight limit and all that
[1:55:23] stuff so anyway little life lesson but
[1:55:25] that's the way the Holy Ghost does me I
[1:55:26] don't know if he does you he'll let you
[1:55:28] take the test and he'll let you fail
[1:55:30] every once in a while but he'll he'll go
[1:55:32] hey
[1:55:33] read the sign it's on every road and
[1:55:36] it's important
[1:55:38] you seen those you've seen those things
[1:55:39] on YouTube where the truck's driving
[1:55:42] under a under a bridge
[1:55:45] oopsie
[1:55:47] it's supposed to be 14 and a half feet
[1:55:49] and they're like 15. that don't fit
[1:55:52] under a 14 and a half foot Bridge
[1:55:55] and the bed comes completely off
[1:55:58] all right he didn't read his sign
[1:56:00] because back about a mile before that
[1:56:02] there was a sign that said
[1:56:04] Bridge 14 and a half feet limit all
[1:56:07] right so let's get our sign right all of
[1:56:11] us the sign is now for us to go up that
[1:56:13] statue of perfect man add to these
[1:56:16] things add to your faith virtue
[1:56:18] knowledge tempers patience godliness
[1:56:19] you're moving right on up in the line
[1:56:21] let's read what the prophet says and
[1:56:23] then we'll stop fifthly add godliness oh
[1:56:25] my godliness to be added what does
[1:56:27] godliness mean I just told you about an
[1:56:29] hour's worth of that it means deity
[1:56:31] dwelling inside of you and letting it
[1:56:33] work yes knowing see you when you're
[1:56:36] born again you got deity inside of you
[1:56:38] uh you're a baby but you don't know how
[1:56:40] to walk
[1:56:41] you don't give a baby a checkbook you
[1:56:44] sure don't give a baby a credit card
[1:56:46] you ought not giving me 16.
[1:56:51] 20.
[1:56:56] 40.
[1:56:58] I'll get somebody man's in a minute
[1:57:04] what does godliness mean I looked up
[1:57:06] four or five dictionaries it just means
[1:57:08] to be like God
[1:57:09] it means to let that deity that's inside
[1:57:12] of you out and let it work
[1:57:15] he's asking you to have virtue which is
[1:57:18] strength he's asking you to have the
[1:57:20] knowledge of God to know that a preacher
[1:57:22] is telling you the truth or not telling
[1:57:23] you the truth
[1:57:25] some of y'all
[1:57:27] Sister Barbara did she send you all that
[1:57:29] WhatsApp that she was out there uh
[1:57:31] listening to a preacher out there and
[1:57:34] what you know what she said she said
[1:57:35] thank God for the ministry in this
[1:57:37] church
[1:57:38] because they were not telling the truth
[1:57:42] they were not telling the truth it was a
[1:57:44] Doctrine that's prevalent all over the
[1:57:45] all over the the uh
[1:57:48] message
[1:57:50] listen and we'll talk about that maybe
[1:57:52] one day we're going to have to when we
[1:57:54] get up to to The Headstone because the
[1:57:56] headstone message
[1:57:57] is the sharpening of the pencil it's the
[1:58:00] sharpening of the sword it's not that
[1:58:02] you don't have the sword you've got the
[1:58:03] sword from the beginning
[1:58:05] you just don't know how to use it
[1:58:07] brother Brown said then if you've got
[1:58:09] the sword he said it takes a strong hand
[1:58:11] of Faith to use it it doesn't matter if
[1:58:14] you got the prettiest longest sharpest
[1:58:17] sword if you don't know what you're
[1:58:18] doing you might cut yourself
[1:58:21] not the enemy but if you're trained to
[1:58:24] do the right thing make the Right Moves
[1:58:27] he said you can take it right straight
[1:58:29] to the heart of the enemy
[1:58:31] that's what we'll talk about later on
[1:58:32] because see that's a faith that's that's
[1:58:34] more than that Faith that's right here
[1:58:37] remember brother Brown said faith alone
[1:58:38] won't do it
[1:58:40] not just faith in everybody there's a
[1:58:42] lot of faith but we gotta have rapturing
[1:58:44] faith and we'll talk about that a little
[1:58:47] bit later on so to be like God he says
[1:58:51] oh no I can't do that brother Bramble
[1:58:53] yes you can
[1:58:54] you gotta let out what's inside of you
[1:58:56] let it work
[1:58:58] if you don't have it please don't sleep
[1:59:01] until you get it
[1:59:03] we're not guaranteed tomorrow we're not
[1:59:05] guaranteed the next two seconds
[1:59:10] all the virtue all the things that's in
[1:59:12] God is in you
[1:59:14] all the things
[1:59:16] be therefore p-e-r-f-e-c-t brother Brown
[1:59:19] said even as your father in Heaven
[1:59:21] is perfect
[1:59:22] so brother Brown is uh and you can see
[1:59:24] by by discernment you know he's
[1:59:26] preaching on virtue and he's you know
[1:59:29] knowledge
[1:59:31] he gets the temperance and he makes a
[1:59:33] couple of statements like well man
[1:59:34] that's gonna you know knock a lot of us
[1:59:35] off
[1:59:37] but when he gets to Godliness he starts
[1:59:39] feeling that the people are like we'll
[1:59:41] never be able to do this
[1:59:43] we'll never be able to get there that's
[1:59:45] my brother around had to Kate looks like
[1:59:46] he backs up
[1:59:48] and he says yes you can
[1:59:50] be there for p-e-r-f-e-c-t what's that
[1:59:53] perfect
[1:59:55] you get way up here now before you're
[1:59:57] asked to do that all these things has to
[2:00:00] be added first so he's telling them you
[2:00:01] got to add this first can't just jump up
[2:00:03] there you gotta add this first
[2:00:05] then when you get up here he's asking
[2:00:08] you all right let me put in my own words
[2:00:10] he's asking you to use what you've got
[2:00:14] he's asking you to use all that
[2:00:16] knowledge all that virtue all the things
[2:00:19] that God's given us Temperance patience
[2:00:21] he's asking you to put it together
[2:00:25] and realize your deity
[2:00:28] you're part of deity
[2:00:31] he's asked you now to be perfect
[2:00:33] godliness Sons and Daughters of God
[2:00:35] how many things I could say then he
[2:00:37] talks about turning to Ephesians let's
[2:00:39] read this
[2:00:42] a man that's born of God a Son of God
[2:00:44] has to have the nature of God
[2:00:47] he has to be like God
[2:00:49] he honors God
[2:00:51] he's part of the word of God
[2:00:54] and in this last days of this bride
[2:00:57] taking form now this is us the bride
[2:00:59] taking form
[2:01:01] just exactly the same power that he was
[2:01:03] at the beginning he has come through
[2:01:06] these organizations and so forth listen
[2:01:07] folks
[2:01:09] God was in the Baptist one day
[2:01:13] God was into Methodist one day he's not
[2:01:15] now
[2:01:18] uh they split all they want to
[2:01:20] there's some good people in there but
[2:01:22] the organization
[2:01:24] you see what it's doing now it's
[2:01:25] shutting churches down
[2:01:28] a whole church the whole uh all of
[2:01:31] Oklahoma pretty much 50 something
[2:01:32] churches pulled out of that whatever
[2:01:34] they're doing to let gay people preach
[2:01:36] and all that stuff
[2:01:37] then I read where in Pennsylvania
[2:01:40] the Methodist Church is saying oh no we
[2:01:42] own the buildings you all need to leave
[2:01:47] that's God
[2:01:49] that's the bride in the end time
[2:01:52] it's we have enough fighting with each
[2:01:54] other now
[2:01:57] there's ain't no fighting over that
[2:02:00] but but God came through these
[2:02:02] organizations but remember what brother
[2:02:03] Brown said they cabbage down in other
[2:02:05] words they said this is it
[2:02:07] God said look moving on this is it nope
[2:02:09] Moving on but listen this is it amen
[2:02:14] there can't be nothing else but that
[2:02:19] so we're at the end
[2:02:23] there's a Doctrine according to
[2:02:24] Godliness
[2:02:25] and I just proved it to you by being
[2:02:28] deity
[2:02:30] all right
[2:02:31] godliness with contentment is great gain
[2:02:34] you know if you if you say that what
[2:02:37] what is contentment
[2:02:39] now to me and you contentment is
[2:02:42] everything is going right
[2:02:45] every bill is paid your car
[2:02:49] doesn't skip
[2:02:51] the check engine light doesn't come on
[2:02:54] your tires just inflate on yourself on
[2:02:57] their own self
[2:02:59] we wished
[2:03:00] but what is godliness with contentment
[2:03:04] what is the word contentment a perfect
[2:03:06] condition of life in which no Aid or
[2:03:10] support is needed
[2:03:13] all right
[2:03:15] sufficiency of the necessities of life a
[2:03:19] mind contended with this lot
[2:03:23] now listen we're not supposed to that
[2:03:24] doesn't mean to sit down you're
[2:03:25] satisfied where you're at that means
[2:03:28] you're content where you're at right and
[2:03:31] I know we're not all as we were talking
[2:03:33] last night there is there is questions
[2:03:35] in our mind and and my sister asked she
[2:03:37] said well how do you know you got the
[2:03:39] new birth I said I asked him for it
[2:03:40] every day
[2:03:44] what brother Dale always tell us
[2:03:46] I'd rather seek God every day and say
[2:03:48] Lord give me the Holy Ghost and know
[2:03:51] that I got it
[2:03:53] then to just say well bless God I know I
[2:03:55] got it because I can understand the
[2:03:56] seals and I'm sitting in the church and
[2:03:58] I go to Lula and
[2:04:00] Oklahoma
[2:04:01] and realize when you get to the end you
[2:04:04] didn't have it
[2:04:05] all you had was an anointing
[2:04:08] that made you feel good
[2:04:10] hmm
[2:04:12] so seek him every day of the life
[2:04:15] every day of your life say God
[2:04:17] I want more of you
[2:04:21] I want more of you
[2:04:26] we talk about Christ was turned out
[2:04:30] the colonel the wheat
[2:04:31] see that's what we're looking at we're
[2:04:33] not looking at plants anymore everybody
[2:04:35] with me real quick all right just shake
[2:04:36] yourself just for a minute we're not
[2:04:38] plants all right because remember
[2:04:40] justification is two shoots right that's
[2:04:43] got life in it
[2:04:45] but it doesn't look like corn
[2:04:48] for those of you that's growing things
[2:04:49] you plant corn if it it's going to get
[2:04:53] about this high before it really doesn't
[2:04:54] look like grass
[2:04:56] hey man the only reason you know it's
[2:04:58] corn is you planted it in that row
[2:05:01] right but if you were to just walk out
[2:05:03] there and say what's that well it looks
[2:05:05] like grass to me start pulling it up
[2:05:07] no but I promise you once it matures and
[2:05:10] gets on up and it puts a character
[2:05:13] he puts on the character of what the
[2:05:15] seed is
[2:05:16] when he starts putting on the character
[2:05:18] somebody goes oh that's corn
[2:05:21] oh that's a Christian
[2:05:23] cause they act like it
[2:05:26] you don't see him on never mind you
[2:05:29] don't see him on Sunday doing something
[2:05:30] else
[2:05:32] laughs
[2:05:34] here's the word Christ himself himself
[2:05:36] that's the anointed word which shall
[2:05:37] come for the rest of his body the bride
[2:05:39] the anointed of the same water that
[2:05:41] watered the weed as we talked about also
[2:05:44] watered the tears anointed ones he's
[2:05:46] talking about anointed ones at 10 time
[2:05:49] but remember those who endure to the end
[2:05:52] shall see the corn
[2:05:54] those who endure to the end shall see
[2:05:55] the wheat
[2:05:56] you will see I'll promise you you go
[2:05:58] plant corn and if nothing else happens
[2:06:00] if you get enough water and you get
[2:06:02] enough fertilizer you will have a couple
[2:06:04] of ears of corn on that stalk
[2:06:06] all right you can't make it you can't
[2:06:08] change it all right only God can change
[2:06:11] it
[2:06:13] so he's talking about anointing ones
[2:06:14] only the word will separate them not the
[2:06:17] signs we'll talk about that last night
[2:06:19] now watch right here I'm gonna read this
[2:06:21] right here this will this will help uh
[2:06:23] the sister that um
[2:06:24] that asked that question last night
[2:06:27] they're anointed in their second realm
[2:06:30] all right so anointed ones are anointed
[2:06:32] in their second realm not in their soul
[2:06:34] all right
[2:06:35] now look
[2:06:37] today so confused about the evidence of
[2:06:40] the Holy Ghost and so forth
[2:06:42] Satan can impersonate any kind of gift
[2:06:45] that God's Got
[2:06:49] but he can't bring the word
[2:06:51] word by word
[2:06:56] he can bring some
[2:06:58] like I was telling you before
[2:07:00] went to Memorial Day meeting years and
[2:07:02] years ago and this brother was preaching
[2:07:04] on the Millennium and he was I mean I
[2:07:06] still preach stuff that he preached that
[2:07:08] he brought out that that I had not seen
[2:07:10] about the Millennium but he was sleeping
[2:07:11] with a 14 year old girl at that time
[2:07:13] every time he was doing that
[2:07:15] and got caught and got put in jail
[2:07:17] and he's back out now and if he repents
[2:07:20] that's okay but at the moment I thought
[2:07:24] he was weak
[2:07:26] because he was preaching the word
[2:07:30] but he fell
[2:07:32] somewhere he didn't preach at all
[2:07:34] but he cannot bring that word word by
[2:07:36] word there's where he failed in the
[2:07:38] Garden of Eden that's where he'll always
[2:07:41] fail talk about Satan
[2:07:43] then he's talking about the faults and
[2:07:44] only ones shout speaking tongues dance
[2:07:46] preach the gospel and still a devil
[2:07:55] look at this promise
[2:07:56] know that the Lord has set apart
[2:08:00] him that is Godly for himself
[2:08:04] he set us apart he did not us if you
[2:08:07] start blowing your own whistle
[2:08:10] yeah let God blow your whistle
[2:08:13] because he'll blow it at the right time
[2:08:15] the right moment everything will be just
[2:08:17] right when he Blows the Whistle because
[2:08:19] he said he would separate us he would
[2:08:21] set us aside right there's the promise
[2:08:23] all right everybody with me just for a
[2:08:25] minute now so Godly that word Godly
[2:08:27] means Theos
[2:08:29] it is like God or resemble him in any
[2:08:32] way just like I said about deity God's
[2:08:34] representative or vice or
[2:08:38] vast region of magistrates of judges
[2:08:44] you were made sorry after a Godly Manner
[2:08:46] and this is Corinthians but you might
[2:08:47] receive damage of us of nothing for
[2:08:49] Godly sorrow worketh repentance
[2:08:52] to Salvation not to be repented of but
[2:08:55] the sorrow of the world
[2:08:57] worketh death for behold this self same
[2:08:59] thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly
[2:09:02] sort what carefulness
[2:09:04] it wrought in you once you come up to
[2:09:07] the Statue perfect man when you come
[2:09:08] come up to Godliness there is a
[2:09:10] carefulness
[2:09:11] you're careful you don't jump into
[2:09:13] things like we read where brother Brown
[2:09:15] said scrap Heath from ministers people
[2:09:16] that want to go out past the program of
[2:09:18] God
[2:09:20] and they have a wreck
[2:09:22] if you'll stay in the program of God
[2:09:23] realize who you are and what you're
[2:09:25] doing here
[2:09:26] is that not a quote realize who you are
[2:09:28] not who I am now who brother Dale is
[2:09:30] realize who you are and what you're
[2:09:33] doing here
[2:09:34] you'll be in Invincible Army together we
[2:09:37] will be an invincible Army
[2:09:41] let's continue just for a second
[2:09:44] all that will live Godly in Christ shall
[2:09:47] suffer
[2:09:48] persecution
[2:09:51] what the Bible says
[2:09:55] but listen
[2:09:57] the Bible says that Moses
[2:10:00] Moses could have been the next Pharaoh
[2:10:02] he could have had he could have had
[2:10:04] grapes put in his mouth by the most PR
[2:10:06] the most beautiful women in the world
[2:10:08] until the day he died
[2:10:10] never have a one of nothing they'd fan
[2:10:13] him
[2:10:14] they'd feed him and he could have a
[2:10:16] harem of women
[2:10:17] he could have all he wanted
[2:10:20] the Bible said he forsook that
[2:10:23] he forsook that
[2:10:26] to be
[2:10:27] the one to lead them out of that
[2:10:30] wow what about me and you
[2:10:34] let's don't sell ourselves out for gold
[2:10:37] silver pearls a good job
[2:10:40] if your job takes you away from God get
[2:10:42] another one
[2:10:43] and all that will live Godly in Christ
[2:10:45] shall suffer persecution but evil men
[2:10:48] and seducers shall wax worse and worse
[2:10:50] deceiving and being deceived
[2:10:54] I'd rather suffer here
[2:10:57] and know I got eternal life
[2:10:59] then as the Bible tells have pleasure as
[2:11:03] Moses did of sin for a season
[2:11:06] listen I was telling them last night I'm
[2:11:08] 63 years old dad's 83.
[2:11:11] but I've only got about 20 good years
[2:11:14] left
[2:11:14] 20 or 25 good years and it's a boast
[2:11:19] some of y'all are older
[2:11:21] you got to think about that
[2:11:23] all right we need to get out of here and
[2:11:25] go up
[2:11:30] listen and what I'm saying I'm saying to
[2:11:32] you young people when I was 25 or 30
[2:11:34] years old I did I was
[2:11:38] I'd have probably said some words I
[2:11:39] shouldn't have said
[2:11:41] but I'd have said there's no way I was
[2:11:42] going to be old enough to draw Social
[2:11:43] Security
[2:11:45] start in September
[2:11:48] June 2.
[2:11:52] we've grown old together we didn't think
[2:11:55] about those things 44 years ago there's
[2:11:57] a lot of things we didn't think about
[2:11:58] but what are you saying by the way
[2:12:00] listen life is fleeting
[2:12:02] doesn't matter if you're allotted 90
[2:12:04] years or sister cleita you know getting
[2:12:06] in the into the late night or middle 90s
[2:12:09] you're not guaranteed to Mark kids
[2:12:11] there's a lot of good kids have passed
[2:12:13] away
[2:12:14] from one Sunday to the next Sunday
[2:12:17] we see them then we don't see them
[2:12:19] anymore you look in the paper and and
[2:12:21] you see all these young people dying
[2:12:24] um Cancers and car wrecks and stuff
[2:12:27] you're not guaranteed but I promise you
[2:12:28] one thing's for sure if you get born
[2:12:30] again you're guaranteed eternal life
[2:12:33] you're guaranteed that you will rise
[2:12:36] again
[2:12:38] and there'll be a Divine Healing on one
[2:12:40] day that your body your old body will
[2:12:42] never be able to get over
[2:12:46] whatever's inside of you is going to go
[2:12:48] get that old body that you lived in and
[2:12:51] it's going to change it completely into
[2:12:52] a brand new creation ain't gonna make it
[2:12:56] eternal
[2:12:57] that's not a fairy tale folks that's a
[2:12:59] promise so you can have whatever you
[2:13:01] want
[2:13:03] of this world take whatever you want to
[2:13:05] this world the High Life the high time
[2:13:07] I've been there
[2:13:10] it's not worth
[2:13:12] one second
[2:13:15] of what I got now
[2:13:17] not one second I wouldn't trade it
[2:13:20] would you those of you there's been
[2:13:22] that's a true would you trade it that's
[2:13:25] why I'm saying last night how could you
[2:13:27] even want to go back to something like
[2:13:29] that
[2:13:31] wow
[2:13:33] no thank you
[2:13:34] look the Lord knoweth how to deliver The
[2:13:37] Godly out of Temptation
[2:13:39] and to reserve the unjust into the day
[2:13:42] of judgment to be punished
[2:13:45] that's what I said
[2:13:46] a little bit of season folks if we're
[2:13:48] having to go through trials and
[2:13:49] tribulations right now you may think
[2:13:52] that you're going through and it's going
[2:13:53] to last all your life no it's not
[2:13:58] you go through a little piece of life
[2:14:02] and you come out on the other end but if
[2:14:05] you'll come out on the other end with
[2:14:06] God
[2:14:09] much better
[2:14:12] blessed is a man that walketh not in the
[2:14:15] Council of the ungodly
[2:14:17] nor standeth in the way of Sinners and
[2:14:20] our sitteth in the seed of the scornful
[2:14:22] but his Delight is in the law of the
[2:14:24] Lord and in his law doth he meditate
[2:14:27] day and night
[2:14:30] you remember back when you weren't born
[2:14:31] again though what'd you meditate on
[2:14:36] what I'm going to do tomorrow
[2:14:37] how much more money I can make
[2:14:40] brother John shaking his head how much
[2:14:42] more debt I can get in
[2:14:45] right I mean that's that's what that
[2:14:47] just took our whole life over
[2:14:49] but now now what
[2:14:51] and it is a real small part you got to
[2:14:54] worry about bills and stuff like that
[2:14:55] but it's all centered around God it's
[2:14:57] all centered around you believing that
[2:15:00] there's a higher there's a deity that's
[2:15:03] not living beside you it's living inside
[2:15:05] of you
[2:15:08] because The Godly are not so they're
[2:15:09] like chaff which the wind driveeth away
[2:15:11] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[2:15:14] the Judgment nor sent us in the
[2:15:15] congregation of the righteous for the
[2:15:17] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[2:15:18] but the way of the ungodly
[2:15:20] Shall Perish an ungodly means Wicked a
[2:15:23] criminal
[2:15:25] we're all criminals but guess what I had
[2:15:28] an advocate
[2:15:30] I had a judge
[2:15:32] I had a lawyer
[2:15:34] and I had all the witnesses
[2:15:38] they said I didn't do it
[2:15:41] because I went into God's Court one day
[2:15:43] and he said I didn't see him do it
[2:15:47] a judge can't do that do you know a
[2:15:48] judge and a jury can't say I saw that
[2:15:50] they have to depend on Witnesses right
[2:15:53] they have to depend on somebody to say I
[2:15:55] saw that and then they make an opinion
[2:15:57] on that they have to make an opinion on
[2:15:59] what they on here say listen I'm not
[2:16:01] making an opinion on hearsay this is
[2:16:04] what God say that's right so I'm gonna
[2:16:06] make I'm gonna form my opinion on what
[2:16:08] God say
[2:16:09] because it's a witness we all are
[2:16:11] witnesses
[2:16:12] I don't want to be a guilty one I don't
[2:16:14] want to be a criminal
[2:16:15] I don't want to be Wicked
[2:16:18] guilty of sin
[2:16:21] Romans 5 verse 5 says in due time Christ
[2:16:24] died for the ungodly thank God because
[2:16:26] we were ungodly at one time
[2:16:29] let's keep going on for a minute
[2:16:31] I want to read just one more thing
[2:16:33] before we go
[2:16:35] we talked about reconciliation last
[2:16:37] Sunday we'll talk about it again
[2:16:41] I'm gonna go just close your eyes makes
[2:16:43] people sick when you do that I'm sorry
[2:16:45] but I want to get down here to the end
[2:16:48] I want to read something to you in the
[2:16:50] seventh seal
[2:16:51] and then we'll get back to brotherly
[2:16:53] kindness because brother kindness is
[2:16:55] kind of a lengthy
[2:16:56] um a lengthy thought
[2:16:59] but we got to get to this and it's going
[2:17:01] to be something that's really going to
[2:17:02] help you and it's going to put
[2:17:03] everything together for those of you
[2:17:05] that's been through the hundred and
[2:17:06] something or those of you that's been
[2:17:07] through 10 or 15. this is the
[2:17:10] culmination is is we're going to come to
[2:17:11] a place that there is an interval
[2:17:15] and in that interval there something
[2:17:16] happens
[2:17:18] all right
[2:17:20] if something happens in that interval
[2:17:22] it's not just you know if you say we
[2:17:23] have an intermission or an interval that
[2:17:25] means that you know you stop the play or
[2:17:27] you stop the movie and you go get you
[2:17:29] something to drink or you go something's
[2:17:31] happening and you're not just sitting
[2:17:32] there asleep
[2:17:35] there's something going on
[2:17:37] so now notice this being one verse
[2:17:39] talking about he's on the seventh seed
[2:17:40] I'm going to read this real quick and
[2:17:41] then we'll stand our feet we'll sing a
[2:17:43] song If you have a need we'll worship
[2:17:45] for a little while and then we'll go to
[2:17:47] the baptismal pool it's ready to go all
[2:17:49] right and anybody wants to be baptized
[2:17:51] we've got plenty of towels
[2:17:52] we can help sisters brothers whatever
[2:17:55] needs to be if you need to change some
[2:17:57] of the sisters talk to a sister
[2:17:59] to where to go Brothers talk to a
[2:18:01] brother where to go all right
[2:18:04] now between the sixth and seventh seal
[2:18:06] something takes place
[2:18:09] see and how lovely that's placed just At
[2:18:12] Its Right Place between sixth and
[2:18:14] seventh chapter we'll get into that
[2:18:15] because if you read your Bible
[2:18:17] Revelations chapter 6 is what
[2:18:21] when the sale start am I with me take us
[2:18:24] out for a minute
[2:18:27] that's when it's that's when it says
[2:18:28] that in the first deal open and then it
[2:18:30] goes down to what goes down to number
[2:18:32] six and then it stops
[2:18:35] then the seventh chapter comes in
[2:18:39] there's an interval then in Revelations
[2:18:41] 8 1
[2:18:43] says that when the seventh seal open
[2:18:45] there was an interval all right if you
[2:18:48] look between Revelations 10
[2:18:50] um 10 6 7
[2:18:53] Revelations 10 listen Revelations 10 as
[2:18:56] an insertion and it's inserted
[2:18:59] read it you'll you'll get your trumpets
[2:19:01] your vowels will go to six and stop
[2:19:03] there'll be an interval or another
[2:19:05] chapter and then there'll be a seventh
[2:19:07] we'll get into that but this it's the
[2:19:09] same thing with right here because
[2:19:10] that's what's going to happen when you
[2:19:11] come to a place of that we come to a
[2:19:14] place of Brotherly kindness and we see
[2:19:15] that thing it says holy spirit there's
[2:19:17] your interval
[2:19:19] thereby with me now listen I want you to
[2:19:21] look real quick faith is not an ass so
[2:19:24] you don't go one two three four five six
[2:19:26] seven eight
[2:19:28] because brother Brown says seven
[2:19:30] there's seven ads
[2:19:32] so add to your faith which is not an ad
[2:19:35] add one two three four five six there's
[2:19:39] an interval and there's seven
[2:19:42] there's an answerable that you got to
[2:19:43] stop and just say hang on a man and you
[2:19:46] know what it is to me it's the
[2:19:46] Providence and grace of God because
[2:19:48] we've went through this you know it's
[2:19:50] kind of like
[2:19:51] it's kind of like you go through um
[2:19:53] school and you have like six or six
[2:19:55] periods or seven six periods and then
[2:19:57] you have a recess
[2:20:00] all right you have an elective
[2:20:03] something that you you kind of your mind
[2:20:05] just kind of you know back a
[2:20:06] little bit that's what I believe God's
[2:20:08] doing here he's like he's man we're
[2:20:10] we're striving one two three four five
[2:20:12] six
[2:20:16] take a breather
[2:20:18] I don't mean go quit going to church
[2:20:20] take a breather all right and that's
[2:20:23] what we look watch and we'll close right
[2:20:25] here now if you notice in the seventh
[2:20:27] chapter we notice between the sixth and
[2:20:29] seventh there's an interval an interval
[2:20:32] between the sixth and seventh chapter of
[2:20:34] the Book of Revelations
[2:20:36] and it's between the sixth and seventh
[2:20:38] seal that this interval is given now we
[2:20:41] want to notice this very important that
[2:20:44] we notice this little
[2:20:47] time
[2:20:49] I just want you to keep that stick that
[2:20:51] in the back of your head because we're
[2:20:52] going to get to it a little bit later on
[2:20:53] we're going to get to that interval
[2:20:55] because it is very very very very very
[2:20:58] very important
[2:21:00] number one it's important to get there
[2:21:02] right there's not an interval between
[2:21:05] one two and three four five six it's
[2:21:07] between six and seven
[2:21:09] there's a there's a time to just
[2:21:11] take a breather stop for a man God knows
[2:21:14] we're humans and we just sat there and
[2:21:16] we you know you sit there and you pound
[2:21:17] and you're pounding you pound your pound
[2:21:19] all right hang on a minute
[2:21:21] there's something we're gonna have to
[2:21:23] deal with in between there we got to
[2:21:25] deal with and understand that that holy
[2:21:27] spirit's the same as it is down here but
[2:21:29] it was something it's something we need
[2:21:31] up there
[2:21:32] we gotta have to continue on we had to
[2:21:36] have Revelations chapter 7 to continue
[2:21:39] with Revelation chapter eight
[2:21:42] everybody with me we had to have
[2:21:44] Revelations 10 inserted between 9 and
[2:21:48] 11.
[2:21:51] for the trumpets and then for the vowels
[2:21:53] and all the different ones you had one
[2:21:54] two three four five six and then there's
[2:21:55] an interval there's a stop point and it
[2:21:58] looks like it's covering something
[2:21:59] totally different but what it's doing is
[2:22:00] it's bridging everything together what
[2:22:02] this is doing right here it's bridging
[2:22:04] us together
[2:22:05] from going from a son of God Revelation
[2:22:08] into the son of man Revelation all right
[2:22:10] that's what we've been trying to get to
[2:22:12] for 100 something sermons so let's stand
[2:22:13] to our feet God bless you thank you for

[2:28:44] let's give the mothers another good hand
[2:28:49] thank you
[2:28:51] remember that when you turn to the Book
[2:28:53] of John and you get to finish reading
[2:28:54] the book of John start reading the book
[2:28:55] of Mama
[2:28:58] that's what's Prophet said if I read the
[2:29:00] book of Mama She's The Fifth Gospel
[2:29:03] all right and we're going when you get
[2:29:05] that we're going to go downstairs uh
[2:29:07] Luke's gonna be baptized anybody else
[2:29:09] wants to be baptized you just show up
[2:29:11] out there I'm going to change clothes
[2:29:12] here it'll take me a few minutes uh if
[2:29:14] the deacons would get the covers off and
[2:29:16] all that it's all ready to go uh it's
[2:29:18] all good and warm I had it on for a
[2:29:20] couple of days so it's good warm the
[2:29:21] water's good and warm and uh if it
[2:29:24] wasn't good and warm we're still going
[2:29:25] to baptize
[2:29:26] but uh we sure appreciate every person
[2:29:29] that's being baptized
[2:29:31] it's a show that they want to do
[2:29:33] something different than what they're
[2:29:35] doing all right I mean we really believe
[2:29:38] that if you'll repent and be baptized
[2:29:41] that God will fill you with the Holy
[2:29:42] Ghost
[2:29:43] that's the whole that's the ultimatum is
[2:29:45] to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[2:29:47] and so we're going to go through the
