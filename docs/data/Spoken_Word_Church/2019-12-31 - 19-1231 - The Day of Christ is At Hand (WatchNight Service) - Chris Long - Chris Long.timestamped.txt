[0:01] we're shining in the light of
[0:04] [Music]
[0:08] to power in love as we sing holy go
[0:18] so high and lived it
[0:22] oh
[0:23] you're shining in the light of your
[0:27] glory
[0:29] pour out your power
[0:33] as we see
[0:37] [Music]
[0:41] Oh
[0:41] [Music]
[0:53] Oh
[0:58] and I want to see
[1:05] amen
[1:07] ma I think we ought to just go home I
[1:11] don't mean to our homes I mean to our
[1:16] home beyond the sky me man I'm looking
[1:19] forward to it I'm looking forward to
[1:22] being with you all over there well we
[1:25] can't get there until we get it together
[1:27] over here and that's what we're
[1:29] endeavoring to do tonight to finish off
[1:32] the old year and enter into the new
[1:35] brother Samuel and I were talking before
[1:37] service and we were talking about when
[1:39] that last one comes in you realize that
[1:41] you could be here tonight
[1:43] you could already have given your heart
[1:45] to the Lord and if you haven't don't
[1:47] hesitate
[1:48] get it right but maybe God's just
[1:52] waiting for me or you to get to the
[1:55] stage of maturity where we have
[1:58] rapturing faith and I'll tell you what
[2:02] the saints that have gone on before us
[2:05] waiting on us
[2:07] shouting for him pulling on us because
[2:12] they realize that the resurrection lays
[2:15] within God's Word which lays within you
[2:19] and I so that resurrection is in us
[2:21] tonight
[2:22] you love him praise the Lord I don't
[2:25] need to introduce myself except maybe to
[2:27] those online my name's brother Chris
[2:29] long I am a friend and a part of your
[2:32] family and it's a pleasure it's a
[2:36] pleasure to be that I'll tell you that
[2:38] right now amen so could we just get
[2:42] right into it I see brother Samuel got
[2:45] me out here a little early so maybe I
[2:47] could go a little longer but
[2:50] anything I'm working on it you know the
[2:54] first time I preached somewhere this
[2:56] brother said brother you got a problem
[2:57] and I said what - help me brother what
[3:01] is it he said you preach too short he
[3:04] said where he come from it was 2 3 hours
[3:07] and they was just getting started well I
[3:09] said well I could probably do it but I
[3:11] hate to where everybody out
[3:13] I'd like to say just 5 words with
[3:16] understanding instead of 10,000 words
[3:19] without hey man so let's just open our
[3:23] Bibles I gave the brothers a title to
[3:26] the message it may seem like an odd
[3:28] title at first but I'm gonna come around
[3:30] to it if it's alright alright so let's
[3:33] go to Genesis 1:26
[3:35] probably a portion of it's probably the
[3:39] my favorite portion of scripture in
[3:41] Genesis because it pertains to you and
[3:44] me and there's a purpose behind it so
[3:46] let's start with that when you got it
[3:48] say Amen man I buy I brought a prop out
[3:54] you might think it's a seed
[3:57] took it out of an avocado I hate to have
[3:59] a kado
[4:01] but it's a seal
[4:05] I'll get to that in just a bit
[4:08] alright here we go and God said I like
[4:12] it already
[4:13] let us make man in our image after our
[4:18] likeness and let them have dominion over
[4:22] the fish of the sea over the fowl of the
[4:24] air and over the cattle and over all the
[4:26] earth and over every creeping thing that
[4:29] creepeth upon the earth so God created
[4:32] man in his own image
[4:34] we know that's a spirit man in the image
[4:37] of God created he him male and female
[4:40] created he them but we're not done
[4:45] there's a purpose behind and God said
[4:48] and that purpose is so that what he said
[4:52] could bring forth after its kind so he
[4:56] had to insert verse 28 and God blessed
[5:01] them who I like and God said unto them
[5:08] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[5:11] the earth and subdue it and have
[5:15] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[5:18] over the fowl of the air and over every
[5:19] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[5:24] let's pray father
[5:26] Lord Jesus were just here father 2:2 be
[5:30] able to be used by you to further your
[5:33] children into the kingdom Lord I want to
[5:37] go with them though tonight father so as
[5:39] I'm preaching to them you let me preach
[5:40] to myself Lord as if I was part of them
[5:43] and they were part of me and we're all
[5:45] part of you we love you we thank you
[5:48] Lord we'll be careful to always give you
[5:51] the praise the honor and the glory Lord
[5:52] if there be any sick amongst us father
[5:55] let the Holy Spirit right now father
[5:57] anoint their bodies and raise them up
[6:00] father and give them the unction to
[6:03] receive from you use my lips
[6:07] remove me father and use me anoint the
[6:12] ears of the hearers let the Holy Spirit
[6:16] be our filter in Jesus Christ's name we
[6:20] pray amen
[6:21] god bless you may be seated
[6:24] now I have taken several different
[6:26] approaches to this
[6:28] my wife's heard it four or five times
[6:30] but it's never the same God's Word has
[6:33] no beginning it'll never have an end so
[6:36] I say this to you as as some a friendly
[6:40] advice quit trying to figure it out
[6:43] we're a creature here on earth that as
[6:48] far as we know we had a beginning but
[6:52] the Word of God has begun to inform
[6:54] those of us who were in him before the
[6:59] foundation of the world
[7:00] that we had no beginning now it's tough
[7:03] it's hard because we see the calendar
[7:07] and the clock and and the days and the
[7:10] seasons and the years go by and and
[7:12] we're up and we're down and we're in and
[7:14] we're out
[7:16] well there was a purpose behind that the
[7:19] purpose behind that was so God could
[7:21] express his attributes did you realize
[7:24] that he wanted to express his attributes
[7:27] now it's interesting because you and I
[7:30] may be in our mental capacity no matter
[7:32] how mentally prowess we are and educated
[7:35] and smart how much we know science and
[7:37] math and and trigonometry and geometry
[7:40] and calculus and and all those things
[7:43] that that science bases their their
[7:46] their mindset on
[7:48] brothers and sisters we never going to
[7:50] figure God out what we need to do is get
[7:54] in
[7:55] fasten our seatbelts and go for a ride
[7:59] just don't get out and we're gonna find
[8:03] out I
[8:04] pray that the Lord will help me bring to
[8:07] you the way this has come about and
[8:11] because God is positive because his life
[8:15] because he's happiness he's joy because
[8:18] he's health because he's all the things
[8:20] that we perceive as good
[8:24] it's pretty hard for us to think about
[8:26] how that this plan that were now flowing
[8:31] through in the stream of life could
[8:34] possibly have come from god
[8:38] but God because he is those things had
[8:42] to permit a weakness he had to pre
[8:46] didn't he's not weak he had to permit a
[8:49] weakness he had to make things in such a
[8:51] way where there could be the possibility
[8:55] if all of the things fell into place
[8:58] which God is not like you and me he's
[9:01] not figuring this out as he goes
[9:03] okay
[9:05] but he's allowing you and me to figure
[9:08] it out as we go because he needs he
[9:10] wants he desires to express his
[9:13] attributes now I know this is this is me
[9:17] I want you to understand the way God
[9:19] uses me in me and me and and has me
[9:23] thinking about meditating on his word
[9:26] and so forth and and and to help you
[9:29] understand how I arrived at what I've
[9:32] got here in my notebook and what I'm
[9:34] gonna preach to you tonight it's it's
[9:36] like this for me then I emphasize that
[9:38] because it's not a doctrine
[9:41] all right it's me entering in to the
[9:45] meditation of God's Word and message and
[9:48] and okay lord help me here I would like
[9:52] to better understand this so is there
[9:55] something I'm a pretty simple guy I'm
[9:57] not highly educated I like to read and
[9:59] and study different things but you know
[10:02] I just barely got through school and
[10:03] sports was the thing that took me
[10:05] through it because I was bored I wasn't
[10:08] saved oh
[10:10] if I were saved when I was in school
[10:13] whoo
[10:16] but God had a plan
[10:18] I'm satisfied with that I'm very
[10:21] satisfied with he knew what he was doing
[10:24] all the time I've come to that
[10:26] conclusion but but God before the
[10:28] foundation of the world in his mind now
[10:30] now I
[10:34] think everybody in here has a mind
[10:39] and if you're not asleep
[10:42] you're probably thinking now you might
[10:46] be thinking what's he going to say
[10:49] you might be thinking hold on for
[10:54] you young people might be thinking about
[10:57] man I'd like to go home and mess around
[10:59] with my stuff
[11:01] give me my cell phone you know there's
[11:05] you don't realize it may be brothers and
[11:08] sisters but it's a reason for all this
[11:09] it's called distraction
[11:14] Satan
[11:17] he has a purpose
[11:20] now we realized that God has not got
[11:24] Satan on a bunch of strings holding him
[11:27] like a puppet because God has
[11:29] foreknowledge now we realize that
[11:31] prophecy
[11:33] prophecy is not God manipulating I want
[11:38] to make that I wanted to get that in
[11:39] prophecy is not God manipulating
[11:42] anything it's God giving you and I our
[11:45] choice as human beings and you and I
[11:47] making choices as human beings and God
[11:49] saying if you choose this this is what's
[11:52] gonna happen if you choose this this is
[11:54] what's gonna happen
[11:55] cuz he's made his free moral agents
[11:58] now that's pretty controversial I won't
[12:01] go into that tonight that'll take weeks
[12:03] months and years because it's by
[12:05] revelation
[12:08] a lot of people think predestination is
[12:11] God's got it all down there for me in
[12:14] the script all's I gotta do is remember
[12:16] the script you know don't forget my
[12:19] lines and
[12:20] Sam I don't I'm show some emotional
[12:25] expression or not
[12:28] and I'm in
[12:31] I'm gonna tell you what kind of God we
[12:33] serve
[12:33] he gave you the choice
[12:37] he gave me the choice I know it's hard
[12:41] to comprehend because we think well
[12:42] God's in control yes he's in control but
[12:45] he's the kind of God that when he makes
[12:48] something he knows what it's gonna do
[12:50] and how it's gonna think
[12:52] cuz think about it who made Satan
[12:55] where'd he come from
[12:58] see God brought him into existence and
[13:02] God said
[13:04] what would you like to do
[13:07] well I'd like to be God
[13:10] he said I'll tell you what he said
[13:14] I'll let you be everything I am
[13:19] except the Creator
[13:22] okay
[13:24] but that's just nod
[13:27] that's just ate at Satan's conscience
[13:31] well I said I wanted to be like God
[13:34] now he's gonna let me go
[13:37] 99.9 percent of the way and then not let
[13:41] me be God
[13:43] there's a reason for that yeah there's
[13:46] only one God
[13:49] there's not two or three or five or ten
[13:51] but you see God
[13:55] allowed Lucifer Satan to be elevated to
[13:58] such a high office that he became if you
[14:01] study your message in the message
[14:04] marriage and divorce he became God's
[14:07] right-hand man now a lot of people say
[14:10] well Satan's not a man we'll have you
[14:12] read your Bible I
[14:15] can take you into his ego to say is this
[14:18] the guy
[14:20] you mean this is the man that buffaloed
[14:22] all of us for all this time and mocking
[14:26] him
[14:27] but see God had a plan
[14:30] and God's plan
[14:34] allowed a
[14:36] weakness
[14:39] but I want you to see how this weakness
[14:42] operates before I go forward because God
[14:45] has has stated in the Bible God said let
[14:50] us make man
[14:53] now when he made that statement
[14:56] Lucifer was like I
[14:59] see my way in I see how I can be like
[15:04] God as a matter of fact the book of
[15:07] Thessalonians which you're gonna read
[15:08] out of pretty quickly says he thinks
[15:12] he's God
[15:14] because he saw while he was a covering
[15:18] cherub did you realize that in the type
[15:22] of the Ark of the Covenant that Lucifer
[15:25] was the right hand cherub
[15:29] and while he was saying holy holy holy
[15:35] under the Lord God Almighty he was
[15:37] studying God's Word oh
[15:42] let us make man
[15:44] he's going to open himself up Satan
[15:48] thinks
[15:51] for his children
[15:54] he said I see it I see how now I can
[16:01] enter in I can't be God I can't make
[16:04] myself God but if I could become a child
[16:08] of God he has no choice
[16:12] because then I would be his offspring
[16:18] think about it and his plan mandates
[16:22] three offices
[16:25] Father
[16:26] Son and Holy Ghost
[16:30] that's the office that Satan failed to
[16:35] implement into his plan in the beginning
[16:38] he said if I can become a son of God I
[16:41] can be like God
[16:45] but God said
[16:51] you can knock on that door
[16:53] you can enter in there
[16:56] but I got another of us and that's the
[17:00] office that I'm going to deal with
[17:03] mankind through and that's the Holy
[17:06] Spirit
[17:08] that's why it's so important to you are
[17:10] to you and I but after Satan began to
[17:14] study God's Word I mean he is the
[17:16] ultimate
[17:17] scientist he's the ultimate
[17:20] mathematician he's the ultimate now he's
[17:22] not God but I want you to remember
[17:25] something about these words that I'm
[17:27] using like education and academia and
[17:29] mathematics and science and so forth we
[17:32] realized that those things aren't bad
[17:34] unless you try to use them
[17:39] against the Word of God
[17:43] God is the supreme mathematician but
[17:48] remember something you cannot figure out
[17:50] God by mathematics
[17:53] you know I don't watch television like
[17:56] you think but I'll I'll find a
[17:58] documentary and and get it and put it in
[18:00] there and watch it and I and I and I
[18:03] happen to do a little bit of a research
[18:05] not making me smarter just interested in
[18:07] why brother Branham mentioned Einstein I
[18:12] mean brother Brandon went so far as to
[18:14] say if Einstein had a spiritual I'll say
[18:18] it like this new birth justification
[18:21] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and if
[18:23] it was the seed of God in the beginning
[18:26] he could have brought worlds into
[18:28] existence
[18:29] what a mathematician and then I see
[18:33] these New Age fellows coming up this
[18:35] Tyson de Grasse saying Einstein he was
[18:38] nothing but just a elementary math
[18:40] student shame on that man
[18:43] because he was the foundation of what
[18:46] this man's building on now I'm not
[18:48] against him I want you understand I just
[18:50] want you to see where I'm going
[18:54] God has no beginning
[18:59] how far can you go back
[19:04] God will have no end how far can you go
[19:09] forward
[19:10] see we have to we have to become we have
[19:14] to come to the understanding that you
[19:16] and I brothers and sisters you young
[19:18] people in here brothers and sisters old
[19:20] people doesn't matter
[19:22] we had no beginning and
[19:27] I know how automatically it's like
[19:32] come on
[19:35] stop trying to figure it out
[19:38] you'll never get anywhere I
[19:42] mean you'll get pages and pages of notes
[19:47] you'll have a massive brain
[19:50] but you'll be no closer to God
[19:53] because God
[19:55] put something into operation that is so
[20:00] simple
[20:02] that it's missed
[20:05] by the wise and the prudent
[20:08] it's called faith
[20:11] what is faith what if you look it up in
[20:14] the dictionary
[20:15] it reads like this paraphrasing it but
[20:18] you look it up
[20:20] something in which you believe
[20:25] it has no proof
[20:30] come on that doesn't even I mean come on
[20:34] brother prove it to me well let me sit
[20:36] let me go on now so before the
[20:39] foundation in the world in the mind of
[20:41] God God had
[20:44] attributes he wanted to express now his
[20:47] attribute are called his children is
[20:50] that right
[20:54] but we're also finding out that his
[20:56] attributes consist of healer
[21:02] is that one of his children
[21:05] watch now
[21:08] provider
[21:10] is that one of his children is that one
[21:12] of his attributes
[21:14] Savior
[21:18] but nothing was lost
[21:21] nothing had a need
[21:25] nothing was sick
[21:27] you with me now
[21:30] we're gonna have to journey by faith oh
[21:35] yeah we've got to lay the textbooks
[21:37] aside and now we got a journey about
[21:38] nothing was sick nothing was lost
[21:40] nothing had a need and on and on and on
[21:43] and so forth so so how did this all come
[21:47] about
[21:48] if you and I or I shouldn't even say if
[21:51] because you and I are his children his
[21:53] attributes how did we get sick how come
[21:57] we have needs why are we lost
[22:02] well the truth in the matter is we're
[22:04] not sick
[22:07] we're not lost
[22:10] I'll get there I know it's like huh
[22:13] why am I in this condition yeah because
[22:16] you're one of his attributes and what
[22:18] you desired in the mind of God
[22:22] was to be able to be used by your father
[22:26] God to fulfill his attributes so I say
[22:32] it like this brother say know not to
[22:33] throw you off but I say it like this
[22:35] because I'm gonna venture by faith right
[22:37] now and I'm gonna say would you say
[22:39] father well I have an attribute existing
[22:42] in me and it's just bubbling around in
[22:44] there and it is to be a savior
[22:49] hmm
[22:51] nothing's lost
[22:53] well I'll have to go to the dictionary
[22:55] dad and look that up
[22:59] look up the word Savior
[23:03] the word Savior requires
[23:06] something lost
[23:08] something not saved
[23:11] something unsaved
[23:14] so perhaps I'll use myself an example I
[23:17] think you could put yourself in here
[23:19] without any foreknowledge I
[23:23] say
[23:25] alright daddy you need to be a savior I
[23:30] need to be lost you
[23:33] want to be here I'll go
[23:37] I'll be sick
[23:39] all the time
[23:42] not realizing that we're fulfilling
[23:47] the plan of God
[23:53] can you imagine Lucifer
[23:56] he's going yeah I'll make him sick
[24:02] I'll figure out how to lose them that's
[24:06] right that's right
[24:09] I'll show them what it means to have a
[24:12] need
[24:13] and God's not like oh
[24:20] you know when God says anything he
[24:25] puts faith in his own word
[24:28] and it comes to pass
[24:30] so brothers sisters here you and are
[24:32] tonight New Year's Eve
[24:35] 2019 going into 2020 I got saved in 1978
[24:41] of August and I never thought I'd see
[24:45] the Christmas of
[24:47] 1978 I
[24:49] really believed that the rapture was
[24:52] going to take place the next day I
[24:58] want you to understand me I've never
[25:00] stopped believing I believe that we're
[25:04] in the rapture
[25:07] and because we can't figure God out
[25:10] mathematically we don't have to put a
[25:12] date on it you could but we don't have
[25:15] to why because we're sitting in heavenly
[25:17] places in Christ Jesus
[25:20] and time
[25:24] doesn't matter anymore
[25:27] can we get there that's where I want to
[25:31] go I want to become the fulfillment of
[25:35] revelations 10 and time shall be no more
[25:40] oh the clocks gonna still tick if I take
[25:42] it back into Genesis 1 and read to you
[25:44] the very first sentence and in the
[25:47] beginning
[25:51] that's time
[25:55] but that's time without a clock
[25:59] and then God began to bring his creation
[26:05] through the spoken word in the
[26:07] manifestation now we realize that the
[26:10] Prophet taught us it could have been
[26:12] millions and millions and trillions of
[26:14] years but if you're not a creature of
[26:16] time a day is a thousand years and a
[26:19] thousand years is a day I mean what's
[26:21] what's the big deal
[26:24] he's not growing old
[26:28] huh
[26:30] in the beginning time
[26:34] seven days in the book of Genesis it
[26:39] looks like time but you and I begin to
[26:41] become involved in the message of the
[26:45] hour which is what it is
[26:49] and we see that God informed a prophet
[26:53] that
[26:54] Adam and Eve did not live under the
[26:56] clock and calendar but there were nights
[26:59] and days
[27:00] until the fall
[27:04] now we got a problem because now we're
[27:09] growing older by the day and you young
[27:13] folks I'm gonna give you a fair warning
[27:16] I
[27:17] was young once
[27:19] I
[27:20] thought I was invincible
[27:23] but I'm paying for it dearly tonight
[27:27] my back hurts my shoulders hurt my arm
[27:30] hurts mine I got an artificial titanium
[27:33] knee
[27:34] it doesn't hurt but everything around it
[27:37] does
[27:39] I'm losing my hair faster than I can
[27:43] shampoo and comb it
[27:45] my face is sagging
[27:49] I'm getting old
[27:51] praise the Lord
[27:54] because he also said in order for me to
[27:58] carry out my plan I'm gonna need
[28:00] somebody to step into the element of
[28:02] time and calendar and clock
[28:06] that begin to decay
[28:11] but because we're attributes of his
[28:13] because we were in his mind before the
[28:15] foundation of the world there's
[28:17] something that tells us it's okay
[28:22] now I could bring out the word theophany
[28:26] but that's a whole different set of
[28:28] messages I want to try to get us around
[28:32] to where we're at tonight
[28:37] December the 31st
[28:41] 2019
[28:43] now you all realize that over there in
[28:46] the east they've already been shot
[28:50] it's already the new year over there
[28:53] but for us
[28:56] it's tonight
[28:58] you're still with me
[29:02] I'm gonna get the second Thessalonians
[29:04] in a minute but let me cover a couple
[29:06] things
[29:07] cuz I got time
[29:15] let us make man he says well can I ask
[29:19] y'all a question who's us there's only
[29:22] one God
[29:24] hey there's not - let us make man so I
[29:28] said well I
[29:31] understand but I want to break it down
[29:33] Lord for your people so I looked up the
[29:35] word us
[29:36] seems simple enough well the dictionary
[29:39] says this plural who more than one
[29:44] now there's only one God so God has
[29:48] allowed somebody to enter his arena
[29:52] you understand what I'm saying to come
[29:55] into his classroom and work so close to
[29:59] his side that he could say hey let us
[30:02] make man
[30:05] the word us is plural it's used to refer
[30:09] to the speaker
[30:13] and another person or group I
[30:21] want you to get this
[30:24] God isn't asking
[30:28] you and I to become his partner he's
[30:31] already made us his partner right ear he
[30:35] said and God said let us
[30:37] you see brothers and sisters it's used
[30:40] to refer to the speaker that's God
[30:44] because it says and God said and another
[30:48] person or group of people I wrote down
[30:53] brother Samuel 1st Corinthians 12:12
[30:55] through 20 a mystical body one body many
[31:00] members can I ask you a personal
[31:02] question tonight who wants to be in that
[31:08] number
[31:09] you're choosing right now if you haven't
[31:12] chosen already you're choosing right now
[31:14] and if you don't raise your hand it's
[31:16] okay with me but you've made the wrong
[31:18] choice
[31:20] I'm preaching to you this way so that
[31:23] you'll see there is a choice you can
[31:25] make it it'll change your life
[31:28] and you can become an elite member of us
[31:34] let us make man
[31:39] use the refer to the speaker and another
[31:41] person or group of people as the
[31:44] indirect object or direct object oh I
[31:48] like this look cuz I can understand it
[31:50] of a verb
[31:53] even you school children know what a
[31:55] verb is
[31:57] but if you don't all read it to you it's
[31:59] used to express
[32:02] action oh currents and
[32:06] mode of being oh when I saw that brother
[32:12] Sam I said that's it God has given you
[32:14] an R in the choice how by just entering
[32:18] in by faith to become part of us
[32:25] now let me let me let me I'm gonna just
[32:29] pull off right there I'm gonna go back
[32:30] to it but I want you to see how this
[32:32] works
[32:33] brothers in the back I'm sorry that I
[32:36] didn't give you this page number but I
[32:39] gave him this one
[32:42] Genesis 1 3 through 5 we all know in the
[32:46] Bible that God said
[32:48] let there be light
[32:51] is that right shall we hey if you got
[32:55] nothing
[32:56] don't fall asleep on me now they put it
[33:00] up there for you
[33:01] Genesis 1:3 and God said
[33:05] now I want everybody to understand
[33:07] something as I move forward the first
[33:09] thing that came into existence was not
[33:11] light
[33:14] it was sound
[33:17] and God said
[33:20] let there be light
[33:22] and the Bible says and there was light
[33:27] and God saw
[33:31] a lot
[33:32] that it was good and God
[33:35] had divided the light from the darkness
[33:38] and God called the light day in the
[33:42] darkness he called night and the evening
[33:43] in the morning were the first day now
[33:45] I'm going to refer to something the
[33:47] brother Bram said in the message God's
[33:49] Word calls for a total separation 121 or
[33:52] 64 he says God was going to use the
[33:56] earth
[33:59] you believe that
[34:02] listen careful now and it
[34:05] was in darkness
[34:08] God was going to use
[34:10] the earth and it was in darkness for the
[34:15] first 21 years and eight months of my
[34:19] life I was a piece of dirt
[34:23] that was in darkness
[34:30] he said God was going to use the earth
[34:33] and it was in total darkness the Spirit
[34:37] of God spoke out and said let there be
[34:40] light
[34:42] now well I was the earth he was going to
[34:45] use in total darkness as you were also
[34:47] we didn't have any concept of God said
[34:51] let there be light
[34:55] but he said it for a reason here's why
[34:58] he said you and I think oh he said it so
[35:02] that we could have the warm sun shine
[35:05] that is not the reason he said it he
[35:09] said it for this reason and he separated
[35:11] the light from the darkness and it's
[35:15] been doing that ever since
[35:18] separating his life from dargah primes
[35:21] the Lord so what he said let there be
[35:23] light and you began to receive it it
[35:26] began to separate the darkness from your
[35:29] life and bring light
[35:32] into you
[35:35] in other words he began to enlighten you
[35:38] so that you could become conscious and
[35:42] aware
[35:44] that he was doing it
[35:48] beautiful
[35:51] so what's this in the spoken word is the
[35:55] original seed at the bottom of page 70
[35:57] in this particular publication yeah I
[36:00] know I got notes all over it but that's
[36:01] okay and the pages are falling out but
[36:03] that's okay at the bottom of page 70 it
[36:05] says now the bride of Adam was a type of
[36:10] the second Adams bride
[36:13] now Adams bride Adams bride could not
[36:17] wait
[36:22] we're pretty anxious folks around here
[36:25] God had told Adam and Eve now remember
[36:29] something brothers and sisters God knew
[36:32] it was going to be Adam and Eve but the
[36:34] Bible doesn't say Adam and Eve it says
[36:36] let us make man
[36:42] God had told Adam and Eve through
[36:45] Genesis
[36:47] 1:26 and 27 and 8 multiply and replace
[36:51] the earth now remember something when
[36:53] God made this statement in Genesis 1:28
[36:57] he was talking to
[36:59] Spirit
[37:02] you see what brought me to this point
[37:04] brothers and sisters is we're not
[37:05] fighting flesh and blood stop it I'm
[37:09] telling myself - I'm preaching to myself
[37:10] brother stop it we're not fighting flesh
[37:14] and blood we're not fighting our parents
[37:16] or our children or our grandparents or
[37:18] our grandchildren we're not fighting our
[37:20] co-workers we're not fighting our pastor
[37:21] brothers and sisters in church we're not
[37:23] fighting all the people around the world
[37:25] that have opposing doctrines or the
[37:28] right doctors we're not fighting them
[37:32] right now we're fighting the Prince of
[37:34] the power of the air
[37:37] and I want you to understand tonight
[37:39] brothers and sense if I don't get
[37:40] anything else to you how this is working
[37:43] we are fighting him through the
[37:45] statement let us make man
[37:52] see because when he said let there be
[37:54] light
[37:55] then God said let us make man guess what
[37:58] it's been an on
[38:00] coming thing excuse me brother that's
[38:04] what brother Branham says in spoken word
[38:05] is the original see right here he says
[38:07] multiply and replace theirs it was an
[38:09] oncoming thing
[38:11] promise did you realize that
[38:14] did you realize when you read Genesis
[38:16] 1:26 seven and eight it's an oncoming
[38:19] thing it's a promise
[38:20] now remember something brothers and
[38:22] sisters God's not in a hurry
[38:26] we are
[38:28] and we gotta be careful
[38:31] because he got in hurry
[38:38] she knew what God said
[38:40] even even even even even the serpent man
[38:44] who's being used by the devil
[38:47] said hath God not set
[38:54] but he slipped one in there didn't he
[38:58] you know the word Satan means adversary
[39:02] comes from the word add
[39:06] verse
[39:08] now in the book of revelations chapter
[39:10] 22 it says do not add to or take away
[39:13] from is that right but if the plagues
[39:15] will be added to you and your name will
[39:17] be taken out of the book correct guess
[39:19] what guess how smart Satan is in one
[39:22] fell swoop using one word he not only
[39:24] added to the verse took away from it
[39:28] because he used a negative not
[39:31] he added one negative to God's Word and
[39:35] he not only added to by using it but
[39:37] they tucked away by using it
[39:40] that's how sharp it is brothers and
[39:43] sisters just put the wrong word in the
[39:47] wrong place and not only could you be
[39:49] adding to but you could be taking away
[39:52] from
[39:53] that's why the prophet of God warned us
[39:56] and warned us and warned to stay with
[39:59] the word now I want you to understand
[40:03] something when I say that phrase it
[40:06] doesn't necessarily mean stay with the
[40:09] letter because the letter killeth how
[40:12] come how are we to stay with the word
[40:14] and then the letter killeth because we
[40:16] will apply our intellectual conception
[40:19] to the letter but when it's the word
[40:22] it's made flesh
[40:26] that's John 1 verse 1 and verse 14 in
[40:30] the beginning was the word and the Word
[40:32] was with God and the Word was God
[40:34] I find it interesting that in John 1 he
[40:38] used was
[40:41] of course he always is but so that you
[40:45] and I can see how God's plan was conned
[40:48] and sending down
[40:51] in the beginning God was
[40:55] but now in verse 14 he's made flesh and
[40:59] dwelt among us
[41:02] did you realize he's in the building
[41:05] tonight
[41:06] because wherever two or three are
[41:09] gathered in my name and I know at least
[41:11] two or three of us were gathered in his
[41:13] name
[41:18] and if everybody left and there was only
[41:21] one believer left he could still gather
[41:25] in two or three because he's body spirit
[41:28] and soul
[41:30] now this sinful flesh needs some work
[41:34] but if you're born again of the Word of
[41:38] God and then the spirit of that word
[41:40] rises up and baptizes you there's at
[41:44] least two of you
[41:46] there's at least two of you in the
[41:48] congregation
[41:50] so brothers and sisters do you see that
[41:53] this was an oncoming thing a promise she
[41:55] was watching he says she was not his
[41:58] wife as yet because he had never lived
[42:03] with her the Bride of Christ is not his
[42:06] wife yet he says the wedding supper is
[42:10] to take place now I'll be very careful
[42:13] but I'll make sure that all of the
[42:15] adults and those mature younger people
[42:18] that are in here the reason why he used
[42:21] the phrase wife and not bride
[42:25] is because they had not consummated the
[42:29] relationship
[42:31] but she was his bride
[42:34] even with me all right let me move on
[42:39] put that over there
[42:41] praise the Lord
[42:44] okay so we realize that us
[42:49] let us make man
[42:52] used to refer to the speaker and another
[42:55] person or group of people as the
[42:56] indirect object or direct object of a
[42:59] verb
[43:01] well then it's quite plain to me brother
[43:04] Wade that what Adam what the spirit man
[43:09] was being intended to be used for was to
[43:13] become a noun a
[43:15] verb
[43:17] is of no use
[43:20] without her now and what is it not a
[43:24] person place or thing
[43:28] let us
[43:30] make man in our image
[43:34] so God is beginning to implement an
[43:37] institute his plan but remember
[43:39] something it's by faith
[43:42] we aren't gonna be able to go through
[43:45] the Bible and the message and chart it
[43:47] all down and say that's it I do this one
[43:50] more thing let me just add it just
[43:52] another ingredient I was telling my wife
[43:54] like this
[43:57] the Bible
[44:00] I've already said this job but I'm going
[44:03] to take it to another direction now this
[44:04] is the blueprint
[44:07] but in this analogy this
[44:11] represents the ingredients
[44:14] of the
[44:18] let's make a cake
[44:21] not so you can understand let's let's
[44:23] make a cake so what do we need to make a
[44:26] cake
[44:27] ingredients
[44:29] now once we've collected all the
[44:32] ingredients together
[44:35] there can be some ugly cakes coming out
[44:38] of here they can be 969 different cakes
[44:41] coming out of that same book
[44:43] denominations are called
[44:45] because without the recipe
[44:48] who knows what it's gonna come out like
[44:51] mostly wrong so the message of the hour
[44:54] is the recipe
[44:56] it tells us how much
[45:00] it tells us how to set the temperature
[45:03] and the preheat it tells us it tells us
[45:06] everything we need to know about the
[45:09] ingredients
[45:11] but guess what brothers and sisters we
[45:13] still need a verb
[45:17] somebody has gotta pick up the
[45:20] ingredients somebody has gotta look at
[45:22] the recipe and begin to employ
[45:25] begin to act begin to use those things
[45:30] that are at their disposal to do the
[45:33] work that's called for
[45:35] right now we're going to make a cake so
[45:37] I can tell you how this is working so
[45:40] throughout the history of the book of
[45:44] ingredients there have been all kinds of
[45:47] Baker's
[45:50] but we realize since the beginning of
[45:54] time Abraham had it right
[45:59] Isaac
[46:01] Jacob that became Israel so you see God
[46:05] knows how to take an ingredient and
[46:08] turn water into wine oh I don't have any
[46:11] of that on the Shelf you can fix that
[46:14] we don't have any wine here bring your
[46:17] water I'll change it oh
[46:20] I'll take the book
[46:23] and I'll show you how it's done
[46:26] but we still gotta bake the cake we
[46:28] still had we still got to mix it we got
[46:29] to put it in the bowl we got to put it
[46:30] together now how are we doing this
[46:33] my faith
[46:37] and we put it in the oven and we did it
[46:39] all done
[46:41] now brothers and sisters if you can stay
[46:44] with me this is where the Prophet came
[46:45] in
[46:47] I'm gonna tell you what the way that God
[46:50] deals with me that's all not a doctor
[46:52] but
[46:53] God decided it was time to
[46:56] bring the cake out of the oven
[47:00] and a prophet rises up God washed over
[47:04] him God kept him God protected him God
[47:07] made sure he didn't drink or smoke weed
[47:09] a file his body in any way
[47:12] do you and I have that privilege
[47:17] know
[47:21] how important does that make us
[47:26] huh you see in the Book of Daniel Daniel
[47:31] had an angel coming down and directing
[47:35] him and speaking to him and talking to
[47:37] him and showing him all the things and
[47:40] don't do this and do this and read this
[47:42] and don't read this and don't go there's
[47:44] kind of like the angels coming down to
[47:46] visit brother Branham he had it all
[47:48] right now nope nope nope nope let's
[47:49] scratch that out that's not the way it
[47:51] is here change this to over here this is
[47:53] the way I want you to say it write it
[47:55] down this way
[47:57] praise the Lord do you believe that all
[48:01] but meshach Shadrach and Abednego biddin
[48:05] ago did not have
[48:07] the angel of the Lord coming down and
[48:10] directing and redirecting
[48:14] they only had the word of Daniel
[48:18] see where we're at
[48:21] we don't have the angel the Lord coming
[48:24] down regularly saying oh don't turn left
[48:25] up don't turn right up go straight go
[48:27] back up and even if we did as I said the
[48:31] other day
[48:32] cuz I let's be honest is there anybody
[48:36] in the room or in the internet audience
[48:38] that would not like to have a visitation
[48:41] from the angel of the Lord I prayed for
[48:45] it I'll be honest with you
[48:47] so far
[48:51] he hasn't come the way he came to the
[48:53] Prophet
[48:55] but he came to the prophet and he told
[48:58] the Prophet to tell me and yo
[49:00] y'all got a theophany yeah
[49:04] okay
[49:05] but you're walking by faith why there's
[49:09] a place in the message where brother
[49:10] Branham said if this all in my ministry
[49:13] had to take place under my personal
[49:15] faith forget about it
[49:19] okay and he had great faith but what his
[49:24] faith and his confidence was resting in
[49:27] is that the angel of the Lord came down
[49:29] never lied to him so he began to
[49:33] increasingly lean on well you know I'm
[49:36] waiting for somebody I'd like to get
[49:39] this thing started but I'm waiting for
[49:42] somebody I want everybody in the room to
[49:44] understand that while brother Branham in
[49:47] himself was saying that waiting for the
[49:50] angel the Lord I want you to understand
[49:51] that the Almighty God is waiting for
[49:54] somebody
[49:57] let us
[49:59] we know he can do it he wants you and I
[50:03] to see if we can do it and that makes us
[50:07] his children you see when God sent
[50:10] Abraham up on the mountain with Isaac
[50:13] come on this is the omniscient
[50:16] omnipotent
[50:18] omnipresent God he knew that Abraham was
[50:23] gonna by his foreknowledge take Isaac up
[50:26] take the wood build the fire and raise
[50:29] the knife truth Fox
[50:33] that's not why God did it
[50:35] he wanted Abraham to see that Abraham
[50:38] would do it
[50:40] and when Abraham was pundit huh
[50:44] see see we think well who God stopped
[50:47] him yes he did because he knew Abraham
[50:50] was gonna finish it yeah
[50:53] that's what he wants from you let us
[50:56] make man that was Abraham's
[50:59] final
[51:03] act of faith that
[51:05] gave him the confidence that voice
[51:08] that's been talking to me all that time
[51:10] has me wandering around out here
[51:14] busting up my family my daddy's gone my
[51:17] nephew's gone
[51:19] they calling me crazy
[51:22] but now I know right now I know who I
[51:29] and brothers and sisters the reason that
[51:32] I minister the way I do is because I
[51:34] believe that God is expecting you and me
[51:39] to come to the conclusion of who you are
[51:42] and finish
[51:45] Genesis 1:26 and seven and eight but you
[51:49] see Lucifer because of the way that he
[51:51] thinks and God knew he let him look in
[51:54] there and live said I'm gonna get in
[51:57] there and I'm gonna put myself in there
[52:01] and then I can't be rejected cuz I'm his
[52:04] son
[52:07] there's a problem he didn't know the
[52:11] mind of God
[52:12] because in the crisis the mystery of God
[52:16] revealed brother branham informs it says
[52:18] God kept a few things
[52:21] back here in the back part of his mind
[52:25] now I asked you brothers and sisters
[52:28] what part of the mind of God were you in
[52:32] I'll tell you tonight because of the day
[52:35] we live in in the hour we live in and
[52:37] the signs of the times and the
[52:39] expectation of the scriptures that you
[52:41] and I are to fulfill we
[52:44] were in the back part
[52:47] of the mind of God
[52:52] you know he let Moses see us one time I
[52:58] want to see you he said okay I'll show
[53:01] you exactly what I look like
[53:03] that Moses saw the back part of the man
[53:06] because brothers and sisters what you
[53:09] and I represent now is seeing himself
[53:12] face to face
[53:15] he wouldn't let Moses see the front part
[53:18] because it wasn't the hour of Moses the
[53:21] very same reason why the prophets no
[53:23] longer hear like Moses he brought us up
[53:27] to the Jordan
[53:30] but Joshua
[53:34] is the Holy Ghost
[53:36] you see that's the part that Lucifer
[53:39] forgot about
[53:40] he said I want to be a son and you and I
[53:43] said we want to be the Holy Ghost
[53:45] because we're taught by the Prophet that
[53:47] the Holy Ghost and the spear of God are
[53:49] one and the same the others like the
[53:54] Holy Ghost is an office because of time
[53:56] I
[53:58] just love his word it's the best so let
[54:02] me turn a corner now that I've preached
[54:05] the back part of the message
[54:09] well I'd like to show you how we got
[54:11] here I'd like to show you what time it
[54:13] is because if the Bible will tell us
[54:17] what time it is I'm talking about right
[54:19] now I'm not talking about tomorrow I'm
[54:22] not talking about yesterday I'm talking
[54:24] about right now cuz he's that now God
[54:28] turn to second Thessalonians with me and
[54:31] let's move
[54:33] I'm watching the clock
[54:36] brother Samuel when you hold that finger
[54:39] up like that I'll know I'm done I
[54:46] guess that's an inside thing
[54:49] you got second Thessalonians chapter 2
[54:52] oh
[54:53] I haven't forgot about the seal yet
[54:56] it's coming
[55:01] now we beseech you
[55:05] brethren verse one by the coming I love
[55:10] this I want you to read it with me now
[55:12] we beseech you brethren Paul I mean the
[55:16] word beseech is like compel I mean gone
[55:22] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[55:25] and by our gathering together unto Him
[55:32] I'm pretty sure this was ad 54
[55:38] nearly 2000 years ago and Paul
[55:43] because he's a prophet
[55:46] it's not only looking ahead but he's
[55:49] warning the people of his day
[55:53] okay that she be not soon shaken in mind
[55:57] or
[55:58] be troubled
[56:00] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[56:06] letter as from us you know why Paul said
[56:09] that then it kind of looks like a
[56:12] contradiction of Paul but Paul said it
[56:15] because he wanted to emphasize that if
[56:18] an angel from heaven come and preach any
[56:21] other gospel than what he already
[56:23] preached don't believe him
[56:27] interesting interesting that you and I
[56:30] were talking about a letter that a man
[56:32] said he said he had brother he never had
[56:34] the letter
[56:35] because he couldn't produce it because
[56:38] of what Paul said let no man deceive you
[56:41] by any means I
[56:44] don't care what letter is he's backing
[56:49] as from us as that the day of Christ is
[56:54] at hand does anybody in the building use
[56:57] a Scofield Bible
[56:59] brother Wade what does it say for the
[57:02] phrase at hand
[57:10] you see the only reason that the King
[57:13] James translators put it like that
[57:16] is because they didn't have the
[57:17] revelation that Paul had you see Paul
[57:20] used now present but by saying that he
[57:24] would have thrown off the future
[57:26] generations of believers that were going
[57:28] to come because it's like maybe not
[57:31] present but the mess we're in
[57:36] but we've turned the corner
[57:39] we've turned the corner God sent us a
[57:44] prophet and he made sure to remind us
[57:49] quote after quote after quote that the
[57:54] coming of the Lord the coming of Christ
[57:57] it's right now it's now present and that
[58:01] was what his ministry was and that's
[58:03] what threw people off they said look at
[58:06] the madness so tremendous fillets being
[58:09] used oh he must be God
[58:13] couldn't be
[58:15] you know how I know that
[58:17] because he had to come under the
[58:19] atonement
[58:21] and God don't have to come under no
[58:24] atonement that's how we know Jesus
[58:27] Christ was God because he was the
[58:30] atonement that
[58:31] everybody else had to come under
[58:35] you say well what why to express his
[58:38] attribute
[58:41] you and I may be lost but the songwriter
[58:45] caught it under inspiration I was blind
[58:48] but now I see I once was lost but now
[58:50] I'm found I was sick but now I'm healed
[58:54] I
[58:56] love it God's Word is so tremendous
[59:00] the day of Christ is now present let no
[59:05] man deceive you by any means
[59:10] and believe me brothers
[59:13] every means that their disposal they are
[59:17] going to be used for
[59:21] that day
[59:26] shall not come
[59:30] except there
[59:32] come a falling away first and that man
[59:38] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[59:41] now I realize as in time message
[59:44] believers we're all
[59:47] repeating the Pope that's the Pope
[59:53] have you ever heard about the purple
[59:56] curtain
[59:58] it's who's behind it
[1:00:01] it's who's behind
[1:00:04] the purple curtain we're all looking at
[1:00:07] the purple curtain and it's there and it
[1:00:10] exists and it does have a figure that we
[1:00:14] know as the Pope that represents it
[1:00:17] but it's the devil behind a purple
[1:00:20] curtain that's you and I are aware of
[1:00:24] that we've been made aware of you with
[1:00:28] me but watch this I want you to
[1:00:31] understand but as this is happening
[1:00:33] right
[1:00:34] now
[1:00:36] there are people in here who are aware
[1:00:39] of it and if you're not I'll make you
[1:00:41] aware of it I don't have to call a
[1:00:42] single name because it doesn't matter
[1:00:44] let no man
[1:00:46] deceive you by
[1:00:48] any means for that day shall not come so
[1:00:52] here's the deal ooh it's an indicator
[1:00:55] it's like a scarecrow
[1:00:59] and
[1:01:00] any intelligent
[1:01:04] Raven crow
[1:01:08] Blackbird has figured out over time
[1:01:14] scarecrow praise the Lord
[1:01:17] the good stuff is behind the Scarecrow
[1:01:21] they walk right past it you can put up
[1:01:24] those owls at the gas station Oh turn
[1:01:27] their heads and the pigeons don't care
[1:01:33] put up a scarecrow and the crows show up
[1:01:38] check it out the good stuff is gonna be
[1:01:40] here in a little while
[1:01:41] we'll come back and check it in its
[1:01:45] season
[1:01:46] this brothers and sisters looks like a
[1:01:49] scarecrow it's not the prophet of God
[1:01:52] said when you see this coming to pass
[1:01:55] don't look down look up the redemption
[1:01:59] draws nigh
[1:02:00] it's time
[1:02:03] and we and you you and I have a lot of
[1:02:05] indicators but a lot of the indicators
[1:02:07] that you and I talked about in politics
[1:02:10] and in religion
[1:02:12] our
[1:02:14] indicators that happen after it's too
[1:02:18] late this is telling us now when you see
[1:02:22] this begin to happen and the word
[1:02:27] falling away brother wait is that
[1:02:32] sounds like an awful word
[1:02:35] apostasy maybe that's why King James
[1:02:38] Court didn't put it in there because
[1:02:40] they said well it just don't look that
[1:02:42] way to us so we'll say a falling away
[1:02:45] and the reason they put falling away in
[1:02:47] there is because at the time of King
[1:02:49] James court people were changed in
[1:02:51] religions like they were changing socks
[1:02:56] and they believed that they had the
[1:02:59] central church so if you didn't believe
[1:03:02] the way they believed they're falling
[1:03:05] away
[1:03:06] but here's how sharp the enemy has
[1:03:10] gotten over time you don't have to fall
[1:03:14] away from
[1:03:15] your religion
[1:03:20] you just have to fall away from the word
[1:03:25] in the center of it
[1:03:27] I'd like to say it like this for you
[1:03:30] Bible studies we had 12 tribes of Israel
[1:03:36] and in the middle of those twelve tried
[1:03:38] four on each side their standards and
[1:03:41] their banners and their followers we had
[1:03:44] the Ark of the Covenant inside of the
[1:03:48] Tabernacle in the wilderness is that
[1:03:50] right so let me ask you all a question
[1:03:52] did Israel not have the pure
[1:03:55] unadulterated Word of God
[1:03:57] sent by God written by the finger of God
[1:04:01] nobody is gonna could tell well people
[1:04:03] contested but we know as believers no
[1:04:06] that's that's truth brother and what was
[1:04:07] this wheel doing paying so little
[1:04:10] attention to the Ark of the Covenant
[1:04:15] who's who's whose position is hers whose
[1:04:19] word is more important than who's
[1:04:23] God said well they're not paying any
[1:04:25] attention to me so I'll let the Ark be
[1:04:27] stolen
[1:04:30] they don't really care see see the
[1:04:33] falling away
[1:04:35] really the falling away is to
[1:04:39] discontinue to pay attention to what's
[1:04:42] most important all right
[1:04:46] so brothers and sisters you don't have
[1:04:50] to go anywhere tonight to follow me
[1:04:51] because the word is not fall away its
[1:04:54] apostasy and here's what the word
[1:04:57] apostasy means so that I can bring you
[1:04:59] back around to let us make man you see
[1:05:02] Satan is doing everything he can to
[1:05:04] interfere with one thing
[1:05:07] only one
[1:05:11] the manifestation
[1:05:17] that's what he did in the Garden of Eden
[1:05:19] he interfered with the manifestation of
[1:05:23] the sons of God by entering in to the
[1:05:27] stream of God's sons lineage and now you
[1:05:32] and I are all sitting in here tonight me
[1:05:34] standing up before you with that
[1:05:39] the part we don't like the part that's
[1:05:43] getting old the part that's decaying the
[1:05:45] part that fusses and fumes the part that
[1:05:48] gets mad
[1:05:50] the part that gets frustrated the part
[1:05:52] that don't like this and don't like that
[1:05:58] let us make man
[1:06:00] God has given us the mandate God has
[1:06:04] given us the ingredients God has given
[1:06:06] us the recipe but let me tell you folks
[1:06:08] something making the cake is one thing I
[1:06:11] believe that's why God sent a prophet
[1:06:16] but the corn of wheat abideth law
[1:06:19] let's have fallen to the ground and die
[1:06:21] so more ingredients can come out of it
[1:06:24] so more cakes can come forth
[1:06:26] but here's the
[1:06:29] kicker
[1:06:32] not enough to make the cake
[1:06:37] somebody got to eat it
[1:06:39] somebody got to take a slice that's why
[1:06:42] Jesus said unless you eat the flesh and
[1:06:44] drink the blood of the son of man you
[1:06:45] haven't alive and they go what we got
[1:06:48] for cake
[1:06:49] yeah but I want you to eat it I want you
[1:06:52] to consume it I want you to take the
[1:06:54] Word of God that I represent as the son
[1:06:57] of God he's saying and I want you to
[1:06:59] consume it
[1:07:01] why
[1:07:04] what was the purpose brother Samuel to
[1:07:07] replenish
[1:07:09] you see brothers and sisters that's
[1:07:11] where the devil's holding us all up
[1:07:14] what is the original seed
[1:07:18] thank you so in order for every seed to
[1:07:21] bring forth after its kind what kind of
[1:07:25] seed will it bring for a spoken word
[1:07:28] that's the reason why you got people
[1:07:30] over here saying we're finished with the
[1:07:33] Prophet and you got people over saying
[1:07:35] it's only the Prophet
[1:07:37] because those two factions are places to
[1:07:42] fall
[1:07:43] and they in themselves become the
[1:07:46] definition of apostasy by definition no
[1:07:50] I'm not impugning
[1:07:52] anybody
[1:07:55] but I am gonna give you a slice
[1:08:00] of cake
[1:08:04] now present and apostasy we read the
[1:08:08] definition of apostasy out of the plain
[1:08:11] old dictionary that you go to Barnes and
[1:08:13] Nobles and get is an act of refusing to
[1:08:17] continue to follow obey or recognize a
[1:08:21] religious faith I didn't make it up
[1:08:25] and brothers and sisters I was preaching
[1:08:27] on this weeks ago
[1:08:30] when he came to my attention that people
[1:08:33] are falling left and right
[1:08:36] people are running off over there and
[1:08:38] saying the Prophet is God people are
[1:08:41] running off over here saying this word
[1:08:43] don't matter anymore
[1:08:46] apostasy
[1:08:48] failing to continue
[1:08:52] and they say well all's we needs the
[1:08:54] Holy Ghost well I'll tell you they ain't
[1:08:56] got it I'll tell you why I know they
[1:08:59] ain't got it because in what is the Holy
[1:09:01] Ghost paragraph 54 what did he coming
[1:09:04] you for what did he come in me for
[1:09:08] what's to continue the works of God and
[1:09:12] apostasy seems to fail to continue so if
[1:09:16] you fail to continue you have fallen
[1:09:19] away
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:27] and I believe as much as anybody on the
[1:09:32] planet of listening to the message I'd
[1:09:37] say tapes but nobody's got tapes anymore
[1:09:39] I'll just say the message I can say
[1:09:42] tapes you understand what I mean the
[1:09:44] message
[1:09:45] her brothers and sisters just listening
[1:09:48] to tapes is only staring at the cake
[1:09:53] you see because a corn of wheat abideth
[1:09:56] alone and I believe that what's on those
[1:09:58] tapes is the pure unadulterated kernel
[1:10:01] germ of God
[1:10:05] but guess what happens brothers and
[1:10:07] sisters it abides it alone unless
[1:10:11] it's taken in to the ground you remember
[1:10:14] the earth we talked about
[1:10:15] the earth he was going to use but it was
[1:10:18] in darkness take the seed in and let the
[1:10:22] light shine this little light of mine
[1:10:25] you know the way it starts out of
[1:10:27] sunlight sunlight in my soul today
[1:10:32] sunlight sunlight all along the way but
[1:10:37] after you get a long ways down the way
[1:10:41] it's this little light of mine I'm gonna
[1:10:45] let it shine
[1:10:46] why because GLAAD's
[1:10:49] spoken word
[1:10:51] requires
[1:10:53] something
[1:10:56] it requires
[1:10:58] the production
[1:11:01] of another spoken word because every
[1:11:06] seed brings forth after its kind so the
[1:11:09] spoken word of God doesn't stop
[1:11:14] it continues to bring forth after its
[1:11:19] kind and the end result brothers and
[1:11:22] sisters for you and me you may be
[1:11:24] listening to me shout at you and preach
[1:11:26] to you but the end result of what I'm
[1:11:28] telling you is if you say
[1:11:33] when you say and it comes to pass and
[1:11:37] you say well brother I've done that but
[1:11:38] but God's not a creature of time you and
[1:11:40] I are going hmm come on now I
[1:11:44] said it and it ain't come to pass so I
[1:11:48] must not be a believer because these
[1:11:51] signs follow them that believe right
[1:11:57] don't be deceived by the letter
[1:12:00] what you're interested in is the life
[1:12:03] that's the reason why I bought that
[1:12:05] brought this big old giant avocado seed
[1:12:07] up here is because
[1:12:09] there's life in this seed
[1:12:13] now I only know it's an avocado see
[1:12:15] because I took it out of one
[1:12:17] right did you realize that
[1:12:20] the spoken word
[1:12:24] is the original seat
[1:12:28] but this seed is not doing any good in
[1:12:32] this ziplock bag
[1:12:36] it's a matter of fact if I leave it in
[1:12:38] here long enough it'll rot and decay now
[1:12:41] watch this has anybody ever heard
[1:12:43] brother branham say that if you put too
[1:12:46] much powder in a 222 swift and you fired
[1:12:50] at the squirrel of the groundhog it just
[1:12:53] stares at you
[1:12:55] that's what the groundhogs do out well
[1:12:57] we Lambert
[1:12:59] prairie dogs they call him cousin but
[1:13:01] they bark then the squirrels chatter
[1:13:03] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:13:07] what happened too much powder and the
[1:13:11] bullet disintegrated before it got to
[1:13:14] the the game right he said where are you
[1:13:18] going with this oh but if you rent the
[1:13:20] rest of the story you'll find out that
[1:13:21] if you wait long enough it could be a
[1:13:23] million it could be a bin and it could
[1:13:24] be a trillion years I don't know how
[1:13:26] long it's gonna take but that will come
[1:13:27] back to be a bullet again he said light
[1:13:30] a piece of paper on fire and turned it
[1:13:32] into ash and gas and back into the air
[1:13:34] he says wait long enough and it'll
[1:13:36] become the seed of a tree it'll grow
[1:13:41] tall and strong and somebody will come
[1:13:44] and cut it down and put it in the meal
[1:13:47] and make a piece of paper right I
[1:13:51] believe that but what's that's not where
[1:13:54] it stops if I let this avocado seed rot
[1:13:59] in this baggie
[1:14:01] it's got life in it I
[1:14:04] don't know how long it'll take and I
[1:14:06] don't even have to question how God does
[1:14:08] it but guess what at some point the life
[1:14:10] that's in this seed will eventually
[1:14:13] become another avocado tree
[1:14:17] now we should be able to see that oh now
[1:14:20] let me take it to the next level
[1:14:23] how about the life of God
[1:14:26] they can refuse it they can abuse it
[1:14:32] but it's gonna find
[1:14:34] another seed to rest in and brothers and
[1:14:39] sisters don't be afraid that seed is a
[1:14:43] spoken word and God said let us make
[1:14:50] man did you realize that he's allowing
[1:14:52] you and me to come into his laboratory
[1:14:55] and become a child of God with those
[1:14:58] simple words
[1:15:01] how do we do it brother can you give me
[1:15:03] the formula yes I can faith cometh by
[1:15:06] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[1:15:08] you say well I I listen to the tapes all
[1:15:11] the time that's the problem you're
[1:15:12] listening you're not hearing
[1:15:14] I'm not making fun of anybody but I'll
[1:15:16] just be blunt
[1:15:18] you've heard the mantra press play and
[1:15:21] obey I believe in that the problem is
[1:15:25] hardly anybody's obey
[1:15:27] because if they obeyed what was being
[1:15:30] played they'd realize that Satan is
[1:15:33] trying to block us for becoming the
[1:15:35] manifestation of the sons of God found
[1:15:38] in Romans 8 I believe brother Branham
[1:15:40] was the manifestation of a son of God
[1:15:43] but that don't fulfill description
[1:15:45] because that's not what the scripture
[1:15:46] says the scripture says the sons and
[1:15:50] that includes you ladies
[1:15:52] daughters of God you realize that it's
[1:15:56] not a one-man operation
[1:15:58] listen if God wanted to remain a one-man
[1:16:01] operation he would have just stayed
[1:16:04] hello him
[1:16:07] but he wanted to express himself in the
[1:16:10] form of attributes which I believe are
[1:16:12] sitting in the room tonight one of them
[1:16:14] happens to be preaching to you I
[1:16:16] believe that I am an attribute of God
[1:16:19] how brother show us show us a sign
[1:16:23] you're looking at
[1:16:25] you're looking at the sign if you knew
[1:16:28] me before God called me you'd say ain't
[1:16:32] nobody ever gonna save that guy
[1:16:35] my wife knew me before I was saved
[1:16:40] well we both had to get saved
[1:16:44] and I say this with all honesty God
[1:16:47] knows my heart brothers and sisters
[1:16:50] please
[1:16:51] don't ever think that someone can't be
[1:16:55] saved
[1:16:57] because it's not a fight against flesh
[1:16:59] and blood but we realized by definition
[1:17:02] if somebody is going to
[1:17:05] work
[1:17:07] apostasy
[1:17:09] into their lives
[1:17:12] they need prayer all right they need a
[1:17:15] conversion all right you see because the
[1:17:18] Holy Ghost is to continue the works of
[1:17:20] God and apostasy is an act of refusing
[1:17:23] to continue it also means in the second
[1:17:26] definition
[1:17:27] abandonment I love this one brother
[1:17:29] Samuel it's so plain abandonment of a
[1:17:33] previous
[1:17:35] loyalty oh yeah I used to believe the
[1:17:38] message but I don't know anymore pastas
[1:17:43] don't try to figure it out don't try to
[1:17:46] reason it you see that's what the devil
[1:17:49] got Eve to do to interfere with the
[1:17:53] manifestation of the sons of God which
[1:17:56] would have been Adam's lineage then in
[1:17:59] Adams lineage was Jesus Christ that's
[1:18:03] why he's our elder
[1:18:05] brother
[1:18:07] now in the spoken word is the original
[1:18:11] seed brother Branham begins to explain
[1:18:14] to us how this transpires are you still
[1:18:18] with me
[1:18:19] brother Sam man held his finger up yet
[1:18:21] I'll just keep going
[1:18:22] I'm I
[1:18:25] want to be obedient
[1:18:30] you love it
[1:18:33] how about this
[1:18:39] continue did you know what the word
[1:18:41] continue means
[1:18:43] to fail to continue
[1:18:48] the word continue means to keep doing
[1:18:52] something
[1:18:54] in the same way I like this as before
[1:19:00] no not the old sinful man that we were
[1:19:03] but Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:19:05] today and forever to keep happening or
[1:19:10] existing to remain active
[1:19:13] to maintain
[1:19:16] without
[1:19:18] interruption
[1:19:20] so in this brother Samuel there's no
[1:19:22] sixth seal for the bride
[1:19:25] because she's been judged already
[1:19:27] she's been judged on Calvary we don't
[1:19:30] have to entertain the sixth seal which
[1:19:33] is an interruption of nature if we'll
[1:19:36] just continue
[1:19:39] now I realize that I'm preaching to
[1:19:43] people that go I
[1:19:45] don't know about that you know what
[1:19:48] brother I think you're off your rocker
[1:19:51] yes I am sure I am off my rocker
[1:19:56] wanting to eat the cake brother Samuel
[1:19:59] I'm I'm tired of staring at the cake I
[1:20:02] believe in the cake I know that it's
[1:20:05] ingredients where they came from I know
[1:20:07] who put all the recipe together and how
[1:20:10] it arrived yeah but now it's time
[1:20:14] to not only eat
[1:20:17] the cake
[1:20:19] but to become the ingredients which is
[1:20:24] the spoken word for you and me you see
[1:20:26] every seed brings forth after its kind
[1:20:29] that's the reason why brothers and
[1:20:31] sisters I see that the devil is trying
[1:20:33] to put it on to that he's trying to
[1:20:36] impugn and remove and desecrate the
[1:20:40] fivefold ministry
[1:20:41] why because God hath placed I didn't
[1:20:44] write it in the Bible look I'll be true
[1:20:46] totally honest with you even if I'm not
[1:20:49] one of God's chosen five full ministers
[1:20:52] I believe in him you know why I believe
[1:20:55] in them because it's for the perfecting
[1:20:58] of the Saints and Paul in Hebrews six
[1:21:01] says let us go on to perfection
[1:21:04] now brothers and sisters I'd like to say
[1:21:06] it like this if I was to show a hands
[1:21:09] and we got Ford Chevy and dodge and then
[1:21:11] some foreign truck drivers in here right
[1:21:15] none of them perfect they don't come and
[1:21:18] tell me your Ford is better than that
[1:21:20] brother Chevy and don't tell me your
[1:21:22] Dodge is better than that brothers Ford
[1:21:24] because that's not perfection
[1:21:27] the word perfection means maturity
[1:21:31] it doesn't mean you like blue and your
[1:21:35] neighbor painted their house red and it
[1:21:37] ain't perfect it is to your neighbor
[1:21:40] but how about maturity that's what we're
[1:21:44] looking for and the fivefold ministry
[1:21:46] that God hath placed is for the maturity
[1:21:50] of the saints what maturity do you and I
[1:21:53] need we need to become the grain the
[1:21:55] full grain the grain that bends down
[1:21:58] that God planted in the beginning and
[1:22:01] said let us make man
[1:22:05] that right Satan interfered with that
[1:22:08] and here's the deal the whole world
[1:22:13] Bible says in Romans the whole world the
[1:22:18] whole creation do you realize that takes
[1:22:21] in the universe and the galaxies and the
[1:22:23] stars and the moons and the sputnik's
[1:22:25] that are going out there brother Branham
[1:22:27] said at one day they're gonna find out
[1:22:30] they're just looking at the back of
[1:22:32] themselves I can't wait till it comes to
[1:22:33] the paper our 10 trillion dollar thing
[1:22:37] that we sent out there
[1:22:41] he's looking at the back of us what's
[1:22:43] the deal
[1:22:46] well just going on home with the message
[1:22:49] I believe it
[1:22:51] but see they don't see it the way you
[1:22:53] and I see it you and I are being put
[1:22:58] upon by the Word of God to become the
[1:23:00] manifestation of the sons of God which
[1:23:03] the whole creation is waiting for
[1:23:06] and I'm human like you I think I use it
[1:23:09] well what what brother if you're missing
[1:23:11] the mark what if it's what if it's a
[1:23:13] hundred years from now then we'll be
[1:23:15] waiting on them
[1:23:17] and the message we're preaching today is
[1:23:20] a stepping stone for them if this is not
[1:23:24] the hour but according to Thessalonians
[1:23:28] we're seeing it
[1:23:30] because in the Bible it says falling
[1:23:34] away but the prophet of God put
[1:23:36] emphasizing it like Paul said we beseech
[1:23:39] you he said great falling away
[1:23:42] he don't say that in the Bible but I
[1:23:44] believe it it don't even say in Matthew
[1:23:47] 24:24 that it would be so close that it
[1:23:50] would deceive the very elect but by
[1:23:52] revelation and because we believe God
[1:23:53] sent a prophet we receive it I receive
[1:23:57] it and then you then we ask ourselves
[1:23:58] Lord how is it possible I happen to know
[1:24:01] you're preaching on it right now brother
[1:24:02] Samuel
[1:24:04] the two spirits what two spirits there's
[1:24:08] only one Spirit of God yeah but it's
[1:24:11] what it anoints a
[1:24:14] lot of people think it's a false
[1:24:17] anointing no it's what it's anointing
[1:24:19] his false
[1:24:20] the seed
[1:24:25] playing his day that's why brother
[1:24:27] Branham couldn't see it for all those
[1:24:28] years
[1:24:29] went to his cave come out
[1:24:32] Hebrews six hmm have you ever read
[1:24:35] Hebrews six did you know that Hebrews 6
[1:24:38] is
[1:24:39] apostasy says it right in the margin of
[1:24:43] the Bible therefore leaving the
[1:24:46] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[1:24:49] us go on unto perfection
[1:24:52] come on don't you see why the devil is
[1:24:55] trying to stop God's placed fivefold
[1:24:58] ministry now not everybody that calls
[1:25:00] themselves apostles prophets pastors
[1:25:02] evangelists and teachers are such
[1:25:04] they may have a calling in their life
[1:25:05] but give some callings without
[1:25:07] repentance so they have a gift that's
[1:25:10] being used I want to tell you folks
[1:25:11] something especially you young people
[1:25:13] who love music those people are gifted
[1:25:15] to the max
[1:25:21] but no repentance
[1:25:25] and notice that they all think well not
[1:25:30] all of them we got some different ones
[1:25:33] now but most of them think they're
[1:25:34] serving God
[1:25:36] well in a sense they are
[1:25:40] because all life comes from God
[1:25:44] think about it Eve had King the son of
[1:25:50] perdition he was not God's son but Eve
[1:25:54] spoke truth when she said I've gotten a
[1:25:58] man from the Lord
[1:26:00] now you and I wouldn't be able to
[1:26:02] comprehend that without the recipe
[1:26:05] the recipe said look in the ingredients
[1:26:09] and you'll see that all life comes from
[1:26:13] God so an order for even Cain to be born
[1:26:18] it had to be because of the Word of God
[1:26:21] he just wasn't born by the Word of God
[1:26:27] you still with me
[1:26:29] see I'm not used to preaching this long
[1:26:31] but I'll keep going
[1:26:34] I'm used to being able to bring it in
[1:26:36] little bitty snippets
[1:26:38] is it time okay
[1:26:40] alright
[1:26:42] you love it I hope you're getting
[1:26:45] something out of this
[1:26:47] the foundation of repentance from dead
[1:26:50] works thank you and our fate toward God
[1:26:51] of the doctrine of baptism a haunt of
[1:26:54] hands and a resurrection of the Dead and
[1:26:56] of eternal judgment those really sound
[1:26:58] important because they are
[1:26:59] but you and I should have been moved
[1:27:02] past that by now it's going to be 2020
[1:27:06] at midnight tonight for you and I that's
[1:27:09] here in the state of Georgia and
[1:27:12] 2020 represents by science
[1:27:18] really really really good vision
[1:27:23] it's not perfect vision cuz I already
[1:27:25] had my wife and I knows a brother from
[1:27:27] Colombia was the typology as a brother
[1:27:28] it's gonna be 20/20 you know that's
[1:27:30] that's the prophets eyes looking down
[1:27:33] upon us cuz well I'm gonna be honest he
[1:27:35] believes in the return I
[1:27:37] said well I Got News for your brother if
[1:27:40] you read your message carefully you'll
[1:27:42] find out that the Prophet didn't have
[1:27:43] 20/20 vision
[1:27:46] here 2015
[1:27:50] something must have happened in 1977 huh
[1:27:53] brother Samuel something must have
[1:27:55] happened in 2050 you see what I'm saying
[1:27:57] brothers and sisters but God doesn't
[1:27:59] make you and I aware of it because he
[1:28:01] wants us to become the expression of his
[1:28:03] attributes and stop looking at the clock
[1:28:09] it's funny how that we're so weak that
[1:28:12] we cut a church you know I don't want to
[1:28:15] know the church mom I don't want to go
[1:28:16] to church dad it's like killing me get
[1:28:19] the phone out of your hand you got the
[1:28:21] thing there you know 20 hours of the day
[1:28:24] people driving down the road with their
[1:28:27] phones in their hand oh my wife's I hope
[1:28:29] there's somebody texting
[1:28:31] you get it beside him and sure enough
[1:28:34] they're texting and putting on their
[1:28:35] makeup at the same time while they're
[1:28:36] driving come on
[1:28:38] who's the sisters this is life
[1:28:42] but because life is invisible if I
[1:28:45] chopped open that seed of the avocado
[1:28:48] you're not going to see the life but if
[1:28:51] I plant that baby and I watch over it
[1:28:54] and I keep it you know what's really
[1:28:57] interesting about the parable of the
[1:28:58] sower in Matthew 13 did you realize that
[1:29:05] the seed is the word of God
[1:29:08] that's wild
[1:29:11] because in that parable we find out that
[1:29:14] it's not the seed that's the difference
[1:29:16] maker because there's lots of people
[1:29:18] following the Bible and the message it's
[1:29:20] the ground it falls in
[1:29:22] and you'll realize that each stage of
[1:29:26] the parable of the sower Matthew 13 you
[1:29:29] enter into and hopefully you come out of
[1:29:32] it until you become the good grind
[1:29:35] see now I realize all brick predestinate
[1:29:38] her brother on the good ground to begin
[1:29:39] with really the Bible says you were born
[1:29:41] in sin ship they're literally coming in
[1:29:42] the world speaking lies full of trouble
[1:29:43] in shorter days but I believe that
[1:29:45] little spirit that enter into that
[1:29:47] little body when you were born had
[1:29:49] something in it an element in it that
[1:29:52] God was tracking
[1:29:55] you didn't know it I didn't know it but
[1:30:00] one day and God said
[1:30:04] let us make man huh who was that are you
[1:30:10] kidding me I'm doing everything I can to
[1:30:12] make the greatest man on earth
[1:30:14] you see what I'm saying yeah I was a
[1:30:16] motocross racer I
[1:30:20] found out that you had to work hard
[1:30:23] brother you had to work on the bike you
[1:30:26] had to practice practice practice and if
[1:30:28] you had a gift or a talent you could win
[1:30:30] but guess what
[1:30:33] another Sunday I had to win in another
[1:30:35] Sunday I had to win on another Sunday I
[1:30:37] don't have another Sunday after a while
[1:30:39] I got to be like sis it man is this all
[1:30:41] the rest of life
[1:30:42] now I think I'm on top of my game and
[1:30:44] this is it
[1:30:45] know something inside of me and you
[1:30:49] that's the reason you're here tonight is
[1:30:51] calling you to a much much much higher
[1:30:55] higher higher life
[1:30:59] you've got it in you you're craving it
[1:31:02] whether you know it or not
[1:31:04] but the problem with the age we live in
[1:31:06] is distraction
[1:31:09] you see that's what God did or Saint
[1:31:12] excuse me that's what Satan did in the
[1:31:14] Garden of Eden was distracted Eve just
[1:31:17] long enough
[1:31:19] don't you think that's what he's doing
[1:31:21] to our young people today it's all a
[1:31:23] distraction
[1:31:24] I'm gonna tell you all something them
[1:31:26] cell phones are not gonna give you
[1:31:28] eternal life as a matter of fact if
[1:31:31] you're not careful they'll shorten your
[1:31:33] life
[1:31:33] [Applause]
[1:31:36] that's you know
[1:31:40] well I believe that brother Lewis
[1:31:44] I'm gonna wind up
[1:31:47] okay cuz you could just there's no
[1:31:50] stopping I
[1:31:53] remember an elderly man that's old now
[1:31:57] was a good preacher in his day but I
[1:31:58] heard him in the early 80s he said
[1:32:00] preaching the word like driving your car
[1:32:03] up a one-lane Mountain Road there's no
[1:32:05] place to get off you can't back up so
[1:32:09] you just got to continue till you get to
[1:32:11] the top I said that makes a lot of sense
[1:32:14] and I don't even know if I was a
[1:32:16] preacher back then
[1:32:17] do you love him
[1:32:20] please stand I mean we can see there's
[1:32:23] so much but it's it's okay I'll read one
[1:32:26] thing last thing to you to sum it up
[1:32:28] while the musicians are coming page 104
[1:32:32] of adoption part 4 in this particular
[1:32:36] publication tell me my brother
[1:32:39] tell me my sister
[1:32:43] when was the time that the sons of God
[1:32:46] was ever to be manifested outside of
[1:32:50] this time now
[1:32:52] when were there every time in the
[1:32:56] history those that manifest the time I
[1:33:00] love that to deliver all
[1:33:03] nature
[1:33:05] nature's the nature itself is groaning
[1:33:08] waiting for the time of the
[1:33:11] manifestation why before the atonement
[1:33:14] was made before the Holy Ghost was ever
[1:33:18] poured out before all the Old Testament
[1:33:22] on down there there couldn't have been
[1:33:24] manifestation but yet God said let us
[1:33:27] make man but there couldn't have been
[1:33:29] manifestation at that time
[1:33:32] I'll tell you why because light was busy
[1:33:36] looking for dark earth
[1:33:39] to separate the darkness from so then it
[1:33:42] could shine see that God put in that
[1:33:46] spirit
[1:33:48] it had to wait till this time now all
[1:33:51] things has been brought
[1:33:53] coming shaping up to a headstone to a
[1:33:57] manifestation of sons of God coming back
[1:34:00] and the Spirit of God coming into these
[1:34:04] man plural let us so perfectly until
[1:34:10] their ministry th e ir will be so close
[1:34:14] like Christ and the day of Christ is now
[1:34:18] present till it will join him and his
[1:34:21] church together

[3:23:28] good
[3:23:29] Lord his presence with it for all of you
[3:23:33] coming and being together and enjoyed
[3:23:35] all these people here and to the ones
[3:23:38] from Chile we have thoroughly enjoyed
[3:23:40] being with us with this thank you for
[3:23:42] coming
[3:23:44] always be a door open here that you can
[3:23:47] come in and fellowship with us and have
[3:23:50] a good time in the Lord shows us that's
[3:23:52] what we're trying to invest today amen
[3:23:54] we we've got about five minutes we've
[3:23:58] always just try to take the communion
[3:24:00] just as we finish over into the watch
[3:24:04] you know finish and into the next year
[3:24:06] well we just tell everybody we
[3:24:08] appreciate you appreciate this year
[3:24:10] we've had a good time it's been really a
[3:24:12] good year of fellowship and and all
[3:24:15] we've had a lot of good ministry brother
[3:24:17] and come through and preach for us this
[3:24:19] year and it's been great so you know we
[3:24:22] appreciate that that gives me a change
[3:24:24] these brothers taking over gives me a
[3:24:26] chance to kind of relax a little and not
[3:24:28] not have to be burdened because that's
[3:24:30] that's to do and I'm coughing like crazy
[3:24:32] now the reason I turned over that way do
[3:24:34] the communion I mean y'all wouldn't want
[3:24:37] me to break the bread okay it wouldn't
[3:24:39] bother me and I could stop hitting
[3:24:41] anything do whatever wouldn't bother me
[3:24:43] but some people you know in their mind I
[3:24:45] think well he's them coughing it you
[3:24:47] know maybe he coughed him on his peace
[3:24:48] when we wake up on that pick okay I will
[3:24:51] make those we just have it to the whole
[3:24:53] thing all right but we have had a good
[3:24:55] time we appreciate all of you that have
[3:24:58] been here with us this year we really
[3:25:00] would appreciate it we look forward to
[3:25:02] another year because I do always look
[3:25:05] forward to a new day a new thing a new
[3:25:08] coming a new new beginning because an
[3:25:11] end as I said when we look at the word
[3:25:13] in we think it means to stop it doesn't
[3:25:16] mean that the Bible says Christ is the
[3:25:21] end of the law for righteousness to them
[3:25:26] that believe it well how could it be
[3:25:27] this to stop for some end it's not to
[3:25:30] stop always when you see that word in
[3:25:33] look for a new beginning
[3:25:35] look for something to start instead of
[3:25:39] something to end that way you'll always
[3:25:42] be looking forward and seeing him and
[3:25:46] that way you can always rejoice in him
[3:25:48] and say thank you Lord for bringing me
[3:25:51] through all of this I thought it's been
[3:25:53] him it's been him all through every one
[3:25:55] of us our hearts and lives and things
[3:25:57] and a lot of things that's taken place
[3:25:59] in this year that you know this is an
[3:26:01] election year coming up who cares you
[3:26:05] know everybody argues over who's gonna
[3:26:06] be President the Bible says I put in
[3:26:09] Kings I take out Kings that solves that
[3:26:11] it ain't nothing to us I don't care
[3:26:14] where anybody voted or what not if God
[3:26:16] wants Hillary in the White House and
[3:26:19] nobody but one person votes you get it
[3:26:21] because that's God's work if he won't
[3:26:23] hurt our he'll be there that doesn't
[3:26:26] matter because it doesn't have anything
[3:26:28] to do with all of what we think you know
[3:26:31] the machines back there one fella
[3:26:33] remember had it they had it set up you
[3:26:36] push one button to push voting for this
[3:26:37] guy for president you'd automatically
[3:26:39] voting for the other one and they
[3:26:41] wouldn't do a thing about it they knew
[3:26:44] all about those it doesn't matter what
[3:26:46] does it matter who's gonna be President
[3:26:48] mm-hmm
[3:26:50] its sons and daughters of a living God
[3:26:53] making their selves ready
[3:26:56] to get out of this world
[3:26:58] I'm enjoying being it I've enjoyed
[3:27:01] myself be 80 years old in a I've enjoyed
[3:27:05] that it's been a wonderful time to me
[3:27:08] I don't want to go back I want to go far
[3:27:11] would if I get 10 more years praise God
[3:27:13] I get ten seconds praise God it doesn't
[3:27:16] make no difference with me because
[3:27:18] that's where I have no fear death loss a
[3:27:22] long time ago I got born again that
[3:27:26] solved that problem
[3:27:27] there was no such death to a Christian
[3:27:30] you can't die you just step over in
[3:27:34] another dimension and waiting on the
[3:27:36] rest of them waiting on everybody else
[3:27:38] to come along alright but we do
[3:27:40] appreciate everything and we just say to
[3:27:43] all of you you know we'll go down start
[3:27:46] after we finished the communion and
[3:27:48] we'll eat and fellowship together and
[3:27:51] there's plenty of food so don't go out
[3:27:52] to try to buy something or do something
[3:27:54] to stay and eat with us and and we'll
[3:27:56] have a good time fellowshipping and and
[3:27:58] all like that but be careful on your way
[3:28:00] home because they'll start out there and
[3:28:03] they're buying Hoople off in all the
[3:28:04] world they're drinking and running and
[3:28:07] doing but all we got to do is just rest
[3:28:09] in Christ so let's just think about that
[3:28:13] we'll pray we'll ask God to be with all
[3:28:16] it and then turn it over to wait and let
[3:28:17] him do the communion father we've had a
[3:28:21] wonderful time this year and we thank
[3:28:23] you sometimes it's been hard sometimes
[3:28:26] it's been rough but it was never to be
[3:28:29] nothing more than for our benefit that
[3:28:32] you Lord allowed us to see you and
[3:28:35] demand let you be made manifest among us
[3:28:37] in your love in your care and we pray

[3:28:48] home he and his wife that you'll give
[3:28:50] them a safe journey and that everything
[3:28:51] be all right because we want to do that
[3:28:54] and as we finish up here and ending our
[3:28:56] parts and the people on the way home

[3:30:12] right here hey man so god bless you
[3:30:14] let's turn on your Bibles if you want to
[3:30:16] follow along in first Corinthians 11
[3:30:19] verse 23 Paul speaking for I have
[3:30:22] received of the Lord that which also I
[3:30:24] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[3:30:26] the same night in which he was betrayed
[3:30:27] took bread and when he had given thanks
[3:30:30] he breaking us and take eat this is my
[3:30:32] body which is broken for you that's
[3:30:34] doing remembrance of me after the same
[3:30:37] manner also he took the cup when he had
[3:30:39] supped saying this cup is the New
[3:30:41] Testament it was starting a new
[3:30:42] beginning a new era the Old Testament
[3:30:45] was heading out in the new testament was
[3:30:46] coming in but it had to be in his blood
[3:30:49] because without the death of a testator
[3:30:50] there was no Testament to be enforced so
[3:30:53] he was getting ready to enforce the
[3:30:55] Testament this cup is the New Testament
[3:30:56] in my blood this do ye as oft as you
[3:30:59] drink it in remembrance of me but as
[3:31:01] often as you eat this bread and drink
[3:31:02] this cup you do show the Lord's death
[3:31:04] till he comes wherefore whosoever shall
[3:31:07] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[3:31:09] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[3:31:11] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[3:31:13] examine himself that's what we need to
[3:31:15] do tonight and so let him eat of that
[3:31:18] bread and drink of that cup for he that
[3:31:19] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[3:31:21] and drinketh damnation and to himself
[3:31:23] not discerning the Lord's body but this
[3:31:26] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[3:31:28] and many sleep for judge ourselves we
[3:31:31] should not be judged but when we are
[3:31:32] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[3:31:35] we should not be condemned with this
[3:31:37] world wherefore my brethren when you
[3:31:39] come together to eat tarry one for
[3:31:41] another and if any man hunger let him
[3:31:43] eat at home that you come not together
[3:31:45] unto condemnation and the rest of all I
[3:31:47] said in order when I come let's just
[3:31:49] have a moment of silent prayer
[3:31:52] property God told us to pray for your
[3:31:54] pastor

[3:37:10] good to have them with you - with us -
[3:37:12] and and
[3:37:14] brother sister Fleeman couldn't have you

[3:37:25] good have each and every one of you here
[3:37:26] this new year coming up if we've never
[3:37:28] been this way before right but you know
[3:37:31] that was a provision made in the Old
[3:37:32] Testament
[3:37:33] they told them I said you've never been
[3:37:35] in this way before it just followed the
[3:37:36] priests follow the leading leadership of
[3:37:38] the Lord follow and you'll he'll take
[3:37:41] her to the promised land I promise we'll
[3:37:43] get there he promised it bro Chris
[3:37:46] somebody's gonna make it and I'm just I
[3:37:49] tell her I'm just dumb enough believe
[3:37:51] that he's talking about me like you said
[3:37:53] at Genesis 1:26 man y'all know that's my
[3:37:57] favorite skip to the free zone it's up
[3:37:59] to us you're right free moral agency a
[3:38:06] man who loves the Lord man we're coming
[3:38:10] to a time now where
[3:38:13] you know brother Brown said one time he
[3:38:16] said it's later than you think well
[3:38:17] that's that was 60 years ago so it's
[3:38:21] late so we need to get our provisions
[3:38:23] ready
[3:38:25] get everything right with the Lord I
[3:38:28] think we're on the right track we're
[3:38:30] trying the best to get to get to youth
[3:38:32] to get together and get the older people
[3:38:34] together and we'll have them somebody

[3:39:43] good adversary but I'll promise you one
[3:39:45] thing
