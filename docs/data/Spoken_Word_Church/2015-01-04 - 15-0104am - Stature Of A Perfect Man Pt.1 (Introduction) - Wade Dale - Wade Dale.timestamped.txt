[7:54] since I've had anything and I'm trying
[7:56] to I'm trying to uh trust in the Lord
[8:00] and not be uh brother Dale and I were
[8:02] talking the other day we we can be it's
[8:04] like juel and I brother juel were
[8:06] talking he said it says call for the
[8:08] Elders of the church so you call
[8:09] somebody and have them come pray for you
[8:10] don't come in here sick you know call
[8:14] for the Elders of the
[8:15] church the Lord knew was going to have

[8:22] you so good to be in the house of the
[8:23] Lord you got your Bibles obviously we're
[8:24] going to go to Second Peter
[8:26] 1 and today we're just going to be
[8:29] this is just going to be an
[8:31] introduction uh to the statute of a
[8:33] perfect man I believe it's a very
[8:36] important
[8:39] subject uh hugely
[8:41] important um it's it's a requirement for
[8:46] graduation so it's a required subject so
[8:48] if it's a required subject you know we
[8:50] always hated English and we always I did
[8:52] I didn't like English I I love math and
[8:54] and all that but you still had to get
[8:56] through English to get a degree so to
[8:58] get your degree to get out of here
[9:00] you're going to have to go through this
[9:02] or you don't you can choose one or the
[9:04] other your choice you can choose whether
[9:06] you want to do it or whether you don't
[9:07] want to do it all right but it's
[9:09] requirement for
[9:10] graduation all right so second Peter 1 U
[9:14] I know brother Dale's already said but
[9:15] remember brother Luis he is uh over
[9:18] there doing his work and uh he'll be
[9:20] back on the 20th so keep him in your
[9:22] prayers you'll be gone for a few weeks
[9:24] and remember also myself I'll be gone uh
[9:27] to the Philippines the 25th of February
[9:29] to March the 17th so that'll be a a 3-
[9:33] week uh ordeal so just keep us in your
[9:36] prayers also Fellowship meetings coming
[9:38] up this month be at brother Homer long
[9:41] Gore It's will be on the 17th of January
[9:43] if anybody wants to go let us know not
[9:45] this coming weekend but the next weekend
[9:48] all right uh and also I'd like for you
[9:51] to read while during the week read the
[9:53] statue of a perfect man and blasphemous
[9:56] names because brother brandham continues
[9:58] the next week right the same thought
[10:01] that he had on Statue of a perfect man
[10:03] and also if you get a chance read the
[10:05] evening service of statue of a perfect
[10:07] man which is the guide of my life or a
[10:09] guide cuz really and
[10:12] truly the guide has to guide you through
[10:15] this humanly we can't make it through it
[10:17] humanly we won't make it through it okay
[10:20] so but with with God's help we'll make
[10:22] it through it so um we started in
[10:26] February of 2013 downstairs in the
[10:28] Sunday school class so it took that long
[10:29] for us to just to get to the holy spirit
[10:32] so we're going to try to cram it in in
[10:35] in January we uh covet your prayers for
[10:38] that so let's bow our heads and and talk
[10:40] to the author before we before we get
[10:42] started dear Lord Jesus we pray today
[10:44] Lord that you would sanctify us for this
[10:47] journey you told ones Lord that were
[10:50] going into the promised land to separate
[10:53] yourself and pray and get ready to go
[10:57] over or father we pray that
[11:00] we've tried to do that and we pray that
[11:03] the congregation will also do it whether
[11:06] we be at Faith virtue knowledge
[11:08] Temperance wherever it may be it really
[11:10] doesn't
[11:11] matter we're all one in you but father
[11:15] we want more of you we want to we want
[11:18] the ability for you to live with freedom
[11:22] through our life and not be bound by the
[11:25] things of the world or or the things
[11:27] that Satan brings to us
[11:30] father forgive us of our sins and our
[11:31] many mistakes and the things we do wrong
[11:34] bless the sick that are among us and the
[11:36] ones that are that are home Lord and and
[11:38] thank you for having the uh internet
[11:40] service there for them to watch but Lord
[11:43] we'd rather them be here father enjoying
[11:46] the word of the Lord but Lord as they
[11:48] are sick may you send your word today
[11:50] through the airwaves and heal the people
[11:52] because father you know no distance
[11:54] you're an eternal God that can go around
[11:57] the world in less than a split second
[11:59] Lord you're already there so we pray
[12:01] that you'll go to the ones that are sick
[12:03] Lord just raise them up for you father
[12:05] bless this day continue to be with us
[12:07] bless us through this service in Jesus
[12:09] name
[12:10] amen second Peter 1 verse
[12:14] one now this is
[12:17] Peter bringing something to
[12:20] us that was
[12:24] spoken in the first church
[12:27] age right now that ability to attain
[12:31] that has not been diminished over the
[12:34] ages but it has been lost in Creeds and
[12:38] man's
[12:39] ideas um because it was very much alive
[12:43] and I'm going to give you a few points
[12:45] to ponder this morning as far as an
[12:47] introduction because the from Faith to
[12:50] brotherly kindness there where the holy
[12:52] spirit is that's not something new that
[12:54] brother brandham brought to us that's
[12:56] right it was in the Bible amen it was
[12:59] taught in the first church age so it was
[13:01] in the first church age they had those
[13:03] virtues working in their life so it's
[13:05] not a new doctrine but it took a prophet
[13:08] to tie the loose ends up where that
[13:11] people had say oh you don't really need
[13:13] that or you don't really need this you
[13:14] don't really need that no brother randam
[13:16] comes back and he says okay this is what
[13:18] Peter said it's a requirement and this
[13:20] is what we have to do right all right
[13:22] it's a requirement like I said for
[13:23] graduation so let's just read it Simon
[13:25] Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus
[13:27] Christ now what I've got blue is
[13:29] something that that's what I want you to
[13:30] ponder on um during the series cuz we're
[13:34] going to read this every time the Lord
[13:37] willing I think to them that have
[13:39] obtained light precious Faith all right
[13:43] obtained they went and got it they don't
[13:47] they don't bring the eggs to your house
[13:48] anymore you got to go obtain them at the
[13:50] grocery store so you have to go obtain
[13:52] to them and I put myself in that
[13:54] category to them that have obtained like
[13:56] Precious Faith with us
[13:59] through the righteousness of God and our
[14:01] Savior Jesus Christ so it's not of our
[14:03] own righteousness Grace and peace be
[14:05] multiplied unto you through the
[14:06] knowledge of God and Jesus our lord
[14:09] according as his divine power hath given
[14:11] unto us and here's our gifts given to us
[14:15] all things that pertain unto life and
[14:17] godliness now I want you to see that I
[14:20] the Sunday school class downstairs I
[14:21] think it really hit one day when I read
[14:23] this early in the in the uh study it
[14:27] pertains to life and godliness
[14:29] so this is going to be everyday life
[14:32] amen and the godliness in that life all
[14:36] right it's easy to be Godly
[14:40] here it's not easy to be Godly Monday
[14:43] morning at
[14:45] 7:00 okay but if you'll do these things
[14:48] we'll see through the knowledge of him
[14:51] that has called us to glory and virtue
[14:53] whereby are given so these gifts are
[14:55] given unto us exceeding great and
[14:57] precious promises that by these you
[14:59] might be partakers now he's going to
[15:01] give you something of the divine nature
[15:04] having escaped the corruption that is in
[15:05] the world through lust now what is the
[15:07] divine nature of God Genesis 1:26 and 27
[15:10] is the divine nature of God Jesus Christ
[15:12] was the divine nature of God the nature
[15:15] that Jesus had is exactly the nature
[15:17] that God had or he's a separate person
[15:19] all right so the same nature Jesus had
[15:22] is the same nature God has cuz it's the
[15:24] same
[15:25] being and besides this see there's where
[15:27] we'll talk about this in a minute but
[15:29] let me read it and let you sit down and
[15:30] besides this in other words besides
[15:32] verse 1-5 you got to do something else
[15:36] and besides this divine
[15:38] nature giving all
[15:41] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[15:44] virtue knowledge into knowledge
[15:46] Temperance into Temperance patience into
[15:48] patience godliness into godliness
[15:50] brotherly kindness and brotherly
[15:51] kindness charity right for if there's
[15:54] that little word that's huge if these
[15:57] things be in you comma and abound right
[16:02] abound means overflow not just get a
[16:05] piece of all right abound means to
[16:07] overflow you go into a full Buffet your
[16:10] plates full all right they make you all
[16:14] right these things will make you that
[16:15] you will neither be Barren nor
[16:16] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[16:18] Jesus Christ but he that lath these
[16:21] things is
[16:24] blind okay and cannot see a far off and
[16:28] ha for for gotten that he was purged
[16:29] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[16:32] Brethren give diligence look at all
[16:34] these things abounding in diligence he's
[16:36] you got to strive listen folks these are
[16:38] overcoming they're are character
[16:39] developments that's not just something
[16:41] that's given to you because you're a
[16:43] message believer give diligence to make
[16:45] your calling and election sure for if
[16:49] you do these things let me read let's
[16:51] read that together for if ye do these
[16:55] things ye shall never fall
[16:59] you want to not ever fall do those
[17:01] things Lord bless the word and you be
[17:05] seated but I want to as an introduction
[17:07] we you know we all read these scriptures
[17:09] and I told them that in Sunday school
[17:10] class I didn't it was not a this was not
[17:13] a um a time for them to uh lay out or be
[17:17] asleep we need some amens from the ones
[17:20] that's already heard this amen there you
[17:23] go getting started out
[17:25] well but I want to bring this to you
[17:27] this morning
[17:28] just as an
[17:30] introduction and a brother told me one
[17:32] time at the last ministers meeting and
[17:35] it's really stuck with me he said and
[17:37] he's preaching on a statue of a perfect
[17:38] man there in South Carolina Brother
[17:39] David belon he said this statue of a
[17:42] perfect man is the centerpiece of this
[17:45] message now what's a centerpiece a
[17:48] centerpiece of a table is what attracts
[17:50] you to the table you've look you've went
[17:53] to Banquets or or weddings you have a
[17:56] centerpiece that centerpiece is your
[17:59] first attraction to get you to come and
[18:01] see what's on the table so that's what
[18:03] the stature of a perfect man is it's not
[18:05] something that you can get around it's a
[18:07] requirement all right amen and it's also
[18:10] a subject that's ill taught and it's not
[18:12] taught much around the message I have
[18:14] not heard one person preach on it except
[18:16] brother Dale and a few others to take a
[18:18] series on the Statue of a perfect man
[18:20] and preach on the virtues I wonder you
[18:23] can't preach on something you don't know
[18:25] right so I I wonder about some preachers
[18:28] that uh maybe don't know uh how to get
[18:32] up there because you know what Peter was
[18:34] not Peter was not talking uh in a second
[18:38] person uh Peter was not looking at a
[18:41] secondhand Revelation when he said add
[18:42] to your faith virtue and your virtue
[18:44] knowledge cuz he had those things
[18:46] because remember he was walking to the
[18:48] gate beautiful and he said Silver and
[18:49] Gold Have I None but such as I have what
[18:53] virtue came out of that man and he
[18:55] didn't have to go get it from a bishop
[18:56] or he didn't have to go get it from
[18:58] anyone else he it was already in him all
[19:01] right so it's as we said before a few
[19:04] points it's the centerpiece of this
[19:06] message without the statute of a perfect
[19:08] man taught in the correct order you
[19:10] cannot come to adoption right one more
[19:14] time you cannot come to
[19:16] adoption routing around the stature of a
[19:19] perfect man exactly all right you must
[19:22] come through these virtues these virtues
[19:24] must be birthed into your life they must
[19:27] be a part of your life and and as we go
[19:30] through this we're going to bring some
[19:31] charts out but uh just for reference
[19:34] points though look at that statue of a
[19:35] perfect man now that's not like a gas
[19:39] tank you don't fill up with faith and
[19:42] then stop and then fill up with virtue
[19:44] and stop and then fill up with knowledge
[19:46] those are only reference
[19:49] points in a picture I wish you could
[19:52] take all that out take all the lines out
[19:55] and turn them up this way because you
[19:56] need Faith all the way up virt all the
[19:58] way up knowledge all the way up
[20:00] Temperance all the way up but there is a
[20:01] time in your life where God will show
[20:04] you where you're at right cuz he'll put
[20:09] somebody in front of you to see how your
[20:10] Temperance
[20:12] isly I told him downstairs Temperance
[20:15] and patience they go
[20:17] together but look what they're right at
[20:19] though they're right before godliness so
[20:21] if we break through with those virtues
[20:23] maybe we can start adding a little
[20:25] godliness but remember this requires
[20:29] study though right brother brandham
[20:31] studied on this subject for 30 years
[20:33] before he preached it right and he come
[20:35] to a position where he could bring it to
[20:37] the people and bringing it to the people
[20:40] it requires study because if you'll keep
[20:42] on going like I said the next Sunday he
[20:44] preached on it
[20:46] again he was preaching Blasphemous names
[20:49] but he brought right back in the Statue
[20:51] of a perfect man and then the week
[20:54] before he talked about it and then a
[20:56] couple of months later he continued to
[20:59] talk about adding to your faith and all
[21:01] those things I'll right up to the
[21:04] opening of the seals which we're going
[21:06] to look at that today and that's what
[21:07] I'm saying I'm going to put it's going
[21:08] to be an introduction we're not going to
[21:09] talk about virtues today we're just
[21:11] going to talk through the scriptures and
[21:13] through the prophet's message about
[21:16] where all these things come from out of
[21:18] the word of God so let's turn to
[21:20] Ephesians 4 and begin there because I
[21:23] believe that Paul picked up the same
[21:27] thought as Peter I believe I believe
[21:29] Paul was at the faith of the fathers
[21:31] Paul had these virtues working in his
[21:33] life so Paul having these virtues
[21:35] working in his life he could explain
[21:37] them but he may have not have explained
[21:39] them in a in the same way as Peter Peter
[21:44] was giv you a requirement add to your
[21:47] faith virtue virtue knowledge and and he
[21:50] come to a spot and he really didn't tell
[21:53] you how he just knew that he just saw
[21:55] that you had a to get the divine nature
[21:57] of God you had to get the new birth you
[21:59] had to get these things in your life but
[22:01] then Paul comes around being a prophet
[22:03] and he tells you how to get
[22:05] them okay Paul comes along a little bit
[22:08] later and explains how to get them and
[22:11] you're not going to get them any other
[22:12] way than this all right verse
[22:16] 11 and he gave some Apostles some
[22:19] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[22:21] and
[22:22] teachers problem is like brother juel
[22:24] said they keep crossing their gift they
[22:27] need to keep their gift in order
[22:28] everybody needs to keep their gift in
[22:30] line because like I was telling him I
[22:33] said you you're an evangelist you you
[22:35] preach to
[22:38] people a teacher really doesn't preach
[22:41] to people he preaches to the older in
[22:45] the Lord and the pastors and the elders
[22:48] reason being is you can only get so much
[22:50] as a teacher you can only get so much in
[22:52] an hour or an hour and a half or
[22:53] whatever right but if you can get the
[22:55] preacher to see what you see
[22:58] right right then he's going to live with
[23:01] you for 365 days he's going to take the
[23:04] Revelation that he gets he's going to
[23:06] break it down to you we're just so
[23:08] fortunate that that that brother Dale
[23:10] doesn't have to go everywhere to get his
[23:12] Revelation and God brings Revelation to
[23:13] him through all of us through the
[23:15] five-fold ministry and um and we get to
[23:18] get
[23:19] it
[23:20] firsthand so but verse 12 says for the
[23:23] perfecting of the Saints so here's what
[23:26] Paul's telling us this is how you going
[23:28] to get the statue of a perfect man for
[23:30] the perfecting of the Saints for the
[23:32] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[23:34] the body of Christ right till what till
[23:37] we all come in the unity of the faith
[23:40] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[23:42] unto a perfect man now that's what we're
[23:44] preaching on the stature of a perfect
[23:46] man not a statue a statue is is
[23:49] immovable right a statue cannot move a
[23:52] statue cannot do you any good you just
[23:54] look at it and say that's
[23:55] pretty all right but a stature is growth
[23:59] or height development so we're growing
[24:01] up in God till we all come to the unity
[24:03] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[24:05] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[24:08] measure see there's your
[24:09] measure measure of the stature of the
[24:12] fullness of Christ that we henceforth be
[24:16] no more children
[24:18] amen okay you can't be a child and be
[24:21] there where brotherly kindness is you
[24:24] can be a baby at Faith but you can't be
[24:27] a baby at brother L kindness right all
[24:30] right cuz you've grown up Paul said I
[24:32] the things I done as a child i' done as
[24:35] a child but I left them and I went on to
[24:38] other
[24:40] things that we henceforth be no more
[24:43] children see be no more children tossed
[24:45] to and fro carried about with every wind
[24:48] of
[24:49] Doctrine by the slight of men and
[24:52] cunning crafts whereby they lie and wait
[24:55] to deceive but speaking with truth and
[24:58] love
[25:00] amen okay may grow
[25:04] up into him in all things so what's
[25:07] Peter Paul doing Paul's taking what
[25:08] Peter said and he's telling you how to
[25:10] get it and what's going to happen when
[25:11] you get it okay but speaking the truth
[25:14] and love may grow up into him in all
[25:16] things which is the head there where it
[25:19] says love even Christ all right from
[25:22] whom the whole body fitly joined
[25:26] together and we're going to get into
[25:27] that not today but later on fitly joined
[25:30] together and compacted Glory it's not
[25:33] just that we're going to put the
[25:34] building together we're going to pack
[25:36] that thing in just like The Pyramid in
[25:38] Egypt where you can't put a razor blade
[25:40] through those stones to cut them it's
[25:43] going to be so compacted together by
[25:45] that which every joint Supply Apostles
[25:48] prophets pastors teachers evangelist Ley
[25:49] Elders deacons that's why that you know
[25:52] that's why that that's what he's saying
[25:54] watch this according to the effectual
[25:56] working in the measure of every
[25:58] part maketh increase of the body unto
[26:02] the edifying of itself in love so it's
[26:05] for the body it's for the edification of
[26:07] the
[26:08] body alone it's not for anything else
[26:10] it's for the body of Christ no one else
[26:12] this is not to the outside world this is
[26:13] kind of like marriage and divorce it's
[26:16] not for the outside world it's not
[26:17] something you can teach a novice how to
[26:21] receive these things right because
[26:23] number one I said many times the ill
[26:26] teaching in the message is a lot of
[26:28] people teach that you got to that you
[26:29] got to get all these virtues before you
[26:31] get born again because brother random
[26:34] talks about the holy spirit being where
[26:35] it is well how you going to get the
[26:39] divine nature of God as Peter was
[26:41] talking about how you going to get the
[26:42] divine nature of God exactly without
[26:44] having God in you first and then receive
[26:48] these virtues all right it's kind of
[26:49] like a an analogy I was thinking about
[26:51] the other day it's like a car you know
[26:54] it's like you buy a brand new car and
[26:55] you went from Donnie brought an a model
[26:57] to the house a to the house the other
[27:00] day very
[27:02] simple gear shift
[27:05] blinker it got a horn on it no blinker
[27:08] oh I'm sorry blinkers is
[27:12] this but now you take that that's still
[27:14] a
[27:16] car but now you take Dad's car that's
[27:18] got you know that that tells you when
[27:20] the when the tires
[27:22] low right now they're both cars one's
[27:26] just a little more advanced in the other
[27:27] one but you know what Donnie can get in
[27:30] the a model and he can get in the Tahoe
[27:32] and he can drive both of them but
[27:34] there's a lot more to that Tahoe than
[27:36] just driving it down the road right
[27:38] everybody get this say Amen if you don't
[27:40] say oh me some of you just sit there
[27:43] like you're not even here in this
[27:45] building bless your heart I feel for you
[27:49] but you got all these things like a
[27:51] computer you know we got a computer that
[27:53] you get a brand new computer and how
[27:54] many of you use everything in that
[27:56] computer
[27:58] Josh does but he's skilled in what he's
[28:01] doing if you're skilled in what you're
[28:03] doing you can use all the things same
[28:06] way with a new birth with a new birth
[28:08] you get all the bells and whistles and
[28:11] gadgets that you need you can still
[28:13] drive the car you can still come to
[28:16] church and be a good Christian and
[28:17] you're born again and you're going to
[28:19] heaven and you're in the bride but
[28:21] there's a lot more to that car right
[28:25] that you haven't started messing with
[28:28] right but with somebody that puts you in
[28:30] a class that'll teach you how to use
[28:32] those
[28:33] things why is the reason that you don't
[28:35] if you never fool with electricity in
[28:37] your life why why is it that you won't
[28:39] even open
[28:41] that see that fourth those four plugs
[28:44] over there I wouldn't open that why I'm
[28:46] scared of it I'm afraid I'll stick my
[28:49] finger or the screwdriver in the wrong
[28:52] place right but now what about a master
[28:56] electrician
[28:57] just like ty shoes he'll go over there
[29:00] open that up move the wires never get
[29:02] never get electrocuted never turn the
[29:03] thing off I'd have to make sure the main
[29:06] was off out here in the on the parking
[29:08] lot cuz I'm afraid of electricity I hate
[29:11] that jolt and Daddy can just stick his
[29:13] fingers in there and just you know it's
[29:15] Wonder his hair's not kinky many times
[29:17] he's been shocked but if you know what
[29:19] you're doing you understand what I'm
[29:22] saying if you've been taught well if God
[29:24] has taught us then these virtues are
[29:26] added as we study we must study to show
[29:31] our self approved we must study it's
[29:33] required study I'll read it in just a
[29:36] minute where brother BR said these
[29:37] things are a requirement but remember it
[29:39] all begins with a desire if your desire
[29:42] is just to get in that Tahoe and drive
[29:44] it like you do the a model and turn the
[29:46] you know just pull it in drive and turn
[29:48] turn signals and mash the gas you know
[29:51] what you're going to get where you're
[29:52] going may not be as comfortable but
[29:55] you're going to get where you're going
[29:56] but why why not now that God's give us
[29:58] this great word in the end time with no
[30:02] limitations and and and we don't study
[30:05] and we don't you know we do things that
[30:07] that are wrong and it's like you know
[30:09] many times you brother Dale said it one
[30:13] person one person with unconfessed sin
[30:16] in the congregation makes the whole
[30:17] congregation it's a canker right it's a
[30:19] soar you should never I mean like uh and
[30:22] and I apologize if I've done anything
[30:24] last year to any of you brothers and
[30:26] sisters I apologize to today sincerely
[30:28] apologize and and forgive me if I've
[30:30] hurt your feelings or and I know I have
[30:32] so I you can just start shaking your
[30:35] head if I open my mouth most of the time
[30:37] I do but I got to get on up there toward
[30:40] godliness and brotherly kindness maybe a
[30:42] little bit more have a little more
[30:45] patience with you but just forgive me
[30:47] and you ought to do that you ought to
[30:48] keep yourself clean if you play an
[30:49] instrument If You Preach behind here if
[30:51] you're a deacon you better keep yourself
[30:54] clean cuz you're the canker that's
[30:55] killing the church right
[30:58] that's
[30:59] right you're the caner that's killing
[31:01] the church if you're not prayed
[31:05] up ready for the
[31:07] service and you know how the devil is
[31:09] though he'll make sure you have problems
[31:10] before you get here oh
[31:13] yeah but remember one
[31:16] thing these virtues and this whole
[31:20] message is an overcoming you have to
[31:24] overcome and I know a lot of y'all at
[31:26] home are sick but you know what the
[31:29] Overcomers come to
[31:32] church the Overcomers come to church cuz
[31:35] you had to overcome getting your kids
[31:37] ready getting this ready getting dinner
[31:39] ready for today you had to overcome
[31:41] something and I know you have to stay
[31:43] home sometimes I know that but but my
[31:46] people some of you don't come back for
[31:47] second service I can't understand that
[31:49] you can cut wood all day you can watch
[31:51] football all day but you can't come to
[31:53] church two services for God not for me
[31:55] not for brother Dale but for God
[31:59] the Bible still says forsake not
[32:01] assembling yourself together you know
[32:02] what you're doing you're hurting your
[32:03] influence with the church and you're
[32:05] hurting yourself so just deal with it
[32:08] but
[32:09] this statute of a perfect man begins
[32:12] with a desire right even a desire and
[32:16] and and let let me say this
[32:20] delicately even though you may think
[32:22] you're up there where the love part is
[32:24] or the Holy Spirit part is or the
[32:25] brotherly kindness part is we still need
[32:27] to hear these things we still need
[32:30] that's what I said I I don't like those
[32:31] lines there I'd rather turn them up or
[32:33] either do away with them and just put
[32:35] all those virtues uh moving about in
[32:39] that stature because that's not a that's
[32:41] just a um uh a graph or a chart there
[32:47] should be a person standing there Jesus
[32:49] Christ and all those virtues working in
[32:52] and out of his life and then then if
[32:53] we're the body then where are we
[32:55] supposed to be we're supposed to be in
[32:56] that body
[32:58] part but let me read that one more time
[33:00] Ephesians 4:16 For Whom the whole body
[33:03] fitly joined together and compacted by
[33:06] that which every joint supplies
[33:08] according to the effectual working in
[33:10] the measure of every part you're all
[33:13] important everybody's important maketh
[33:16] increase of the body unto the edifying
[33:18] of itself in love amen the stronger
[33:21] supposed to help the weak we're all
[33:22] supposed to do that cuz I may be weak in
[33:25] something that you're strong in you may
[33:27] be strong in something I'm weak in or
[33:28] vice versa you know back and forth so we
[33:30] need to help each other but we still
[33:32] must keep oursel clean by the word of
[33:36] God and then let God guide us through
[33:37] these virtues because uh as I was saying
[33:41] last night I think to somebody God knows
[33:44] where you're going to get
[33:46] to but you don't right not yet it's a
[33:51] journey if we knew the end from the
[33:53] beginning we'd be we'd be
[33:54] Almighty and you know what it'd probably
[33:56] scare to death if we knew the very day
[33:59] something was going to happen so thank
[34:01] God we don't we live day to day we live
[34:05] hour by hour but we live with the intent
[34:09] of getting to church on Wednesday night
[34:10] getting to church on Sunday you know
[34:12] doing the things of God you it's
[34:14] important it's important listen if it's
[34:17] important for for somebody like sister
[34:19] Trudy to come to church Drive 4 hours
[34:22] you know how many people she's going to
[34:23] condemn on that day for not coming to
[34:25] church at least 5 minutes from here 15
[34:27] minutes from here an hour from
[34:29] here because remember what you show out
[34:32] don't care what you got up here like
[34:34] brother J was saying I don't care what
[34:35] you got up here if you don't show it out
[34:38] here what good is it sermon coming from
[34:42] here is wonderful I've known people that
[34:44] could that's got Revelation like you
[34:46] wouldn't believe there's one brother
[34:47] that long time ago and he was caught in
[34:49] adultery with a young girl and all this
[34:51] things but that guy could preach the
[34:52] house down the message of the hour for
[34:56] years preached just preached wonderful
[35:00] messages whole time laying in the bed of
[35:03] adultery with a 14y old girl and a
[35:05] 30-year-old girl and finally got caught
[35:07] and was you know punished for that but
[35:09] still you got to remember one thing it's
[35:11] the life that's going to come down to
[35:13] for the the the life is the last thing
[35:15] it's going to come to that your life is
[35:17] going to speak louder words than
[35:19] anything that comes from your mouth amen
[35:22] well I got quiet but that's okay it's
[35:25] the truth anyhow
[35:27] amen it's the truth it's what it's the
[35:30] it's our cuz remember 90% of the time we
[35:33] live in the world we're not of the world
[35:37] if you're born again now if you're not
[35:38] born again you still are of the world
[35:40] and you do the things of the world and
[35:41] that's the reason you don't do the
[35:43] things that are right but if the spirit
[35:45] of God's in you why if the spirit of
[35:47] God's in me that says I have to be here
[35:49] not just because I hold an office I have
[35:52] to be at church to get this is my
[35:53] filling station this is where I get that
[35:56] fuel
[35:57] to go up that statue of a perfect man
[35:59] and you can't get it any other way I'm
[36:01] sorry but God knew that that's what we
[36:03] needed because he knows where every one
[36:05] of us is going to stop he's not going to
[36:08] uh you know you see the scripture there
[36:10] where he says don't cast your Pearls
[36:11] Before Swine God's not going to throw
[36:13] something out there knowing that you're
[36:14] not going to use
[36:15] it right he's going to know where you're
[36:18] going to be but I'm going to the very
[36:20] last quote that I read maybe this
[36:22] afternoon is going to lay it every bit
[36:25] back in our lap
[36:27] brother Brown makes one outstanding
[36:29] statement I I believe it's in
[36:32] uh maybe in Blasphemous names no it's in
[36:36] the Statue of perfect man it's going to
[36:37] lay it right back in our lap and it's up
[36:40] to us we're still a free moral agent
[36:42] after you're born again you are still a
[36:43] free moral agent you still have the
[36:46] right to accept or reject or to do what
[36:49] God asked you to do or not do what God
[36:51] asked you to do I I don't uh you know I
[36:54] I don't play words when it comes to that
[36:56] so let's let's go now to
[36:59] Zechariah Chapter
[37:02] 6 and verse 12 they'll have these up on
[37:05] here so we can we can get them pretty
[37:07] quick so I don't have
[37:10] to spend a lot of time looking and it's
[37:12] always on the internet the notes
[37:14] are Zechariah 6 and speak unto him
[37:17] saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts
[37:19] saying behold the man whose name is the
[37:22] branch right and he shall grow up out of
[37:25] his place and he shall be build the
[37:27] temple of God now that's your basis cuz
[37:30] who was the branch Jesus Christ so
[37:33] there's the one that he grew up the
[37:35] Bible said Jesus grew in Grace and
[37:37] knowledge and favor with man now it
[37:39] wasn't that he had to receive the Holy
[37:42] Ghost he was the Holy Ghost but he grew
[37:44] in his Humanity in Grace and knowledge
[37:47] all right and favor with man so he had a
[37:50] growth development he had a time where
[37:51] God gave him a place on a mountain to
[37:54] where he uh and we'll read it right here
[37:56] in just just a minute but remember one
[37:58] thing we we're laying an introduction so
[38:01] we're going to kind of come back off a
[38:02] little bit and look at that and see that
[38:04] now as a mountain because we're going to
[38:07] take this and by the help of God we're
[38:10] going to take this and show that that
[38:12] that has to be revealed in your new
[38:17] birth and through your life but that's
[38:19] also the pattern of the city we're going
[38:22] to live in
[38:25] sure amen
[38:27] the future home brother vom comes right
[38:29] back around and brings the pyramid right
[38:31] back in a pyramid shaped mountain now
[38:34] it's not going to look straight like
[38:36] that it's going to have valleys and all
[38:37] things in it but it's going to be so
[38:39] huge but it's going to be a pyramid
[38:41] mountain and who's going to be inside
[38:44] that pyramid City everybody that comes
[38:47] through faith virtue knowledge
[38:48] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[38:50] kindness amen and the love of God is
[38:53] going to be right there on the top where
[38:55] you see in Revelations we'll read it at
[38:57] the very end where the what the throne
[38:59] sits at the top and it can you can see
[39:01] it all the way around now there's no way
[39:02] to see it all the way around unless that
[39:04] thing sitting right on top of that
[39:05] mountain cuz that's the headstone that's
[39:07] Jesus Christ amen so this this types all
[39:10] the way through the all the way through
[39:13] the the message of the hour and all the
[39:14] way through the Bible it types all the
[39:16] way from from Genesis to Revelation
[39:18] because remember Moses had to go up onto
[39:22] a
[39:25] mountain he met God in the plane sure
[39:28] but he had to go to the mountain to get
[39:30] his commission he had to go to that
[39:32] mountain to get the Ten Commandments
[39:35] Jesus had to go up on a mountain to
[39:38] receive his adoption brother brandham
[39:40] had to go to Sunset Mountain he had to
[39:42] get on a mountain in other words it was
[39:44] sure it was symbolic but God must like
[39:47] to meet somebody on the mountain
[39:49] right he must cuz it's where he meets
[39:52] him he meets he's met all the Great Men
[39:53] on on a mountain somewhere all right so
[39:56] let's turn turn to Zechariah
[39:58] 4 and let's see and and use this little
[40:03] um truth
[40:05] here that I believe it'll help
[40:08] you because sure we're going to work on
[40:11] faith virtu knowledge temp SP God
[40:13] brotherly kindness that but there's
[40:15] there's the framework we got to deal we
[40:17] got to work on the framework we got to
[40:18] get the foundation right then we got to
[40:19] work on the framework of you know you
[40:21] say well why do I have to have these
[40:23] things well number one they're
[40:25] requirement they're in the
[40:27] amen number two I just told you Paul
[40:29] told you how to get them all right so he
[40:31] had you have to listen to Apostles
[40:33] prophets Pastor teachers evangelist and
[40:35] study to make yourself approved all
[40:37] right so but watch what's going on here
[40:39] with Zachariah now this man at zerubabel
[40:42] was an actual
[40:44] person he rebuilt the city of Jerusalem
[40:48] after the after the Captivity he come
[40:50] out of jerus he come into Jerusalem
[40:53] rebuilt the city so let's watch in Ze
[40:56] arah who art thou oh great Mountain okay
[41:00] but now watch what's going to happen
[41:01] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[41:04] plane now what's a plane level down at
[41:07] the bottom got to start down at the
[41:09] bottom you can't start at the
[41:10] mountain he's building the great
[41:13] Mountain but he's putting you on a plane
[41:16] everybody's going to be right on that
[41:18] level you know if you're born again
[41:19] you're right there at Faith not up or
[41:21] down or whatever all right who art thou
[41:25] oh great Mountain before or zerubabel
[41:27] Thou shalt become a
[41:29] plain but watch what he's going to do
[41:32] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[41:34] Now where's The Headstone The Headstone
[41:36] is not down here headstone up here he's
[41:39] going to bring forth The
[41:42] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[41:44] Grace Grace unto it so obviously it's
[41:47] going to be grace that we get this all
[41:50] right moreover the word of the Lord came
[41:53] unto me saying the hands of zerubabel
[41:55] have laid the the foundation of this
[41:57] house his hands also shall finish it so
[42:02] the one that started is the one that's
[42:03] going to finish it all right the author
[42:06] and finisher of our faith so you say
[42:08] well zerubabel would type brother
[42:09] Brandon well you got to go to God first
[42:12] it types Jesus Christ first amen all
[42:14] right cuz remember Jesus Christ built
[42:17] that mountain and then man tore it
[42:19] down then zerubabel came and rebuilt it
[42:23] okay the prophet of God in the end time
[42:24] brought a message to rebuild that statue
[42:26] of a perfect man
[42:29] amen the hands of Jer zerubabel have
[42:31] laid the foundation of this house his
[42:34] hands also shall finish it and thou
[42:37] shalt know that the Lord of hosts has
[42:40] sent me unto
[42:42] you for who hath despised the day of
[42:45] small things for they shall rejoice and
[42:48] shall see the
[42:50] plumet now some of you old older ones
[42:53] Gary you you use a plum Bob I'm sure he
[42:57] has a plummet plummet is according to
[43:00] the definition in the Bible is a level a
[43:03] leveling
[43:04] device okay right but also it's a
[43:08] squaring
[43:10] device cuz when that cities built for
[43:14] square remember this pyramid is not
[43:16] three-
[43:18] sided it has four
[43:21] sides justification sanctification
[43:23] baptism Holy Ghost and the word the word
[43:25] had to come in end time sure it's got
[43:27] three sides here but it's a foursided
[43:29] pyramid because the city was built Four
[43:32] Square not three Square Four Square so
[43:34] it's got four corners to it
[43:37] right I didn't know if you knew that or
[43:39] not some people think well no it's just
[43:41] three no it's four square all right but
[43:43] shall see the plummet well the plummet
[43:45] or Plum Bob that we used I've used them
[43:47] a long time ago helping Dad it's a
[43:49] string with a heavy piece on the end of
[43:52] it with a with a stick or or actually
[43:55] it's made out of Brass A lot of them
[43:56] were and they came down to a point well
[43:58] when you got it exactly right you'd pop
[44:00] it in the ground and that was your
[44:02] corner and it was level and straight
[44:05] well that's what zerubabel was coming to
[44:06] do
[44:08] zerubabel in the hands of zerubabel with
[44:11] those seven so it wasn't just him there
[44:14] was seven others that help him built it
[44:16] but type you see Jesus Christ and the
[44:18] Seven Church age Messengers they are the
[44:20] eyes of the Lord right which run to and
[44:22] fro through the whole earth or you can
[44:24] take zerubabel and those
[44:28] seven cuz remember there's seven ads
[44:30] right all right really cuz you add to
[44:33] your faith 1 2 3 4 5 six seven right
[44:38] everybody got that amen add to your
[44:40] faith virt you all the way up to Pyramid
[44:43] all right so you shall see the plummet
[44:45] in the hand of
[44:48] zerubabel and those seven they are the
[44:50] eyes of the Lord which run to and fro
[44:53] through the whole earth all right let's
[44:55] go to
[44:57] Isaiah 28 and
[45:07] 16 got it therefore thus sayith the Lord
[45:11] God behold I lay in Zion for a
[45:14] foundation a stone right now what is a
[45:18] stone in the Bible Revelation right all
[45:21] right Upon This Rock upon this
[45:24] Revelation uh we were talking you know
[45:26] earlier uh the brother brought out in
[45:29] the um at the watch Night Service uh
[45:33] most people don't realize that that
[45:36] Peter didn't answer what Jesus said
[45:40] right there in there in in the in where
[45:43] he read it where who do I who do you say
[45:46] I the son of man am right he said there
[45:49] are the Christ the son of the Living God
[45:52] it was the son of God Revelation not the
[45:55] son of man revelation
[45:56] right cuz the son of mar Revelation was
[45:59] hidden but God said I'll build my church
[46:03] on that Foundation or that
[46:06] Revelation which is the Son of God
[46:08] remember he died Ro he died son of man
[46:11] Rose Son of God he was Son of God
[46:13] through seven Church ages all right the
[46:16] son of man Revelation did not come back
[46:18] until the end time when that headstone
[46:20] left when he ascended he took that cap
[46:23] with him amen we're going to see it in a
[46:25] minute and he took that cap with him and
[46:27] it didn't come back until the end time
[46:29] amen that's the way we see it here
[46:31] that's just the way I see
[46:33] it but the foundation was what Peter
[46:36] said he said Upon This Rock or
[46:37] Foundation I'll build my church so he
[46:40] built the church on the revelation of
[46:42] the Son of God Amen not the son of man
[46:45] the Son of God all right which is God
[46:48] Spirit God all right which is the Holy
[46:50] Ghost down through seven Church ages all
[46:52] right does everybody understand that say
[46:53] amen amen all right so now where were we
[46:58] Isaiah 28:16 therefore thus sayith the
[47:01] Lord God behold I lay in Z for a
[47:05] foundation a stone a tried Stone a
[47:08] precious
[47:09] Cornerstone a sure Foundation he that
[47:13] believeth shall not make haste all right
[47:15] so there's a promise there he that
[47:17] believeth shall not make haste so now
[47:19] let's put the chart up the first chart
[47:22] and we're going to look and and kind of
[47:24] piece this thing together for you cuz
[47:27] there's a lot said about headstone
[47:28] there's a lot said about Cornerstone
[47:29] there's a lot said about this and that
[47:30] and the other so let's just kind of as
[47:32] we said as an introduction if we don't
[47:34] get finished I like this if we don't get
[47:36] finished we'll start again this
[47:38] afternoon okay we listen for for purpose
[47:42] of of leaving the church ages and the
[47:44] church age Messengers
[47:46] off because we're not going to deal with
[47:48] that you should know who the first
[47:50] church age messenger and what the and
[47:52] what the Ephesus and irenius Smyrna and
[47:54] all through that we're dealing with with
[47:56] us the Statue of a perfect man are the
[47:58] virtues so this is the statue of a
[48:00] perfect man this
[48:03] is Jesus Christ the fullness cuz
[48:06] remember he was the fullness of the
[48:08] godhead bodly right father son holy
[48:11] ghost He was all of it this was every
[48:12] bit God right here when he was standing
[48:14] on Earth that pyramid was standing on
[48:16] the Earth right amen that pyramid in its
[48:20] fullness was standing on the earth in a
[48:22] man called Jesus Christ the son of man
[48:25] right all right so we see that now we
[48:27] start here you got Foundation zerubabel
[48:30] laid the foundation and built the
[48:32] building all right Jesus Christ laid the
[48:35] foundation foundation of the Apostles
[48:38] and Prophets who Jesus Christ we'll read
[48:40] it in a minute being the Chief
[48:42] Cornerstone so now when but let's go
[48:44] back here now this is the fullness this
[48:46] is what should be now in the end time
[48:50] amen but take that
[48:54] away watch this
[48:58] that's what we have right through the
[49:01] church agents this is what we have right
[49:04] that all right this is what we have
[49:05] right here right The Headstone was
[49:09] rejected thrown out thrown out of the
[49:12] church he was thrown out of everything
[49:14] but now remember coming up through all
[49:17] the church ages they had some of these
[49:19] virtues it wasn't they just stayed down
[49:22] here at Faith Martin Luther didn't just
[49:23] have faith Martin Luther had to have
[49:25] virtue so people could draw off of the
[49:27] message that he was preaching and
[49:29] receive strength from that message right
[49:32] so he had certain parts of these but not
[49:35] the fullness right the faith of the
[49:37] fathers had been had been man's ideas
[49:41] had eroded this
[49:44] statue statue cuz that's what you're
[49:46] looking at a statue but it's the stature
[49:48] is the growth development but they took
[49:50] that man Jesus Christ and they ate the
[49:52] effects you can't eat the word down you
[49:54] eat the effects of the word right it was
[49:56] the effects of the word that they ate
[49:58] down Through the Ages The Headstone was
[50:00] rejected brother Bram said gone no way
[50:03] for man to get it back so there's no way
[50:05] for the completeness like we were
[50:07] talking
[50:09] before the true token brother BR you
[50:12] know the token didn't come to the end
[50:13] time well they had the token in the
[50:15] first church Age The Tokens of baptism
[50:17] of the Holy Ghost and I was telling
[50:19] somebody the other day and I think it
[50:20] really helped them maybe it was
[50:21] downstairs because remember what's the
[50:24] token the token was the blood that was
[50:27] applied on the doorpost that if you were
[50:30] inside that house you were protected
[50:33] right right exactly right now in the end
[50:36] time the true token was the man hanging
[50:40] at
[50:41] Calvary and brother Brown said the bride
[50:43] is the blood by the spirit we're not
[50:45] just the ones that's being protected by
[50:46] the blood we are the blood right right
[50:50] right amen by the spirit not the literal
[50:53] blood but the Blood by the spirit the
[50:55] spirit that we have Was the Same Spirit
[50:57] that was hanging on Calvary amen right
[51:00] Same Spirit we have the same spirit that
[51:02] was hanging on Calvary that shed his
[51:05] blood so that we can have not just our
[51:08] sins covered see that covered them in
[51:12] Egypt that covered what was behind that
[51:15] door that's not what God
[51:18] wanted right he wanted that Holy Ghost
[51:21] Veil like brother William was he wanted
[51:22] that Holy Ghost Veil back on the people
[51:25] not just covering the people blood of
[51:27] bulls and goats covered sin that's right
[51:30] blood of Jesus Christ takes that sin
[51:32] away right and then we become the blood
[51:35] by the spirit because we have been
[51:36] washed in his blood amen that's the only
[51:39] reason we can stay clean is that we have
[51:42] become the blood glory amen so that puts
[51:45] it back in real order when you bring the
[51:47] headstone back you've brought the blood
[51:49] back you brought everything back or the
[51:51] blood by the spirit not the literal
[51:53] blood right literal blood of Jesus is
[51:55] down still here still on the earth
[51:56] laying somewhere right all right cuz it
[51:58] broke down chemically down in the in the
[52:00] earth it wasn't that literal blood that
[52:02] saved you anyway right it was Faith In
[52:06] The Blood amen right faith in what he
[52:09] done so you go right back down to here
[52:11] you go back down to Faith so down
[52:13] through the church ages that's what it
[52:15] looks like but now as we read here in
[52:20] Ephesians or in Isaiah I lay in z a
[52:24] foundation a Stone a trid stone a
[52:26] precious Cornerstone of sure
[52:29] Foundation now what happened was watch
[52:31] and we're going to go to Ephesians 2 and
[52:33] 19 but don't don't go away from it yet
[52:36] what happened is he went
[52:37] away but remember he came right back on
[52:40] the day of Pentecost that same headstone
[52:43] came on the day of Pentecost but in the
[52:46] form that they could understand amen
[52:49] down in the church a down in the first
[52:51] church age all right so now let's go to
[52:53] Ephesians 2:19
[52:56] now
[52:57] therefore ye Are No More Strangers but
[53:00] fellow citizens with the Saints and of
[53:02] the household of God and are built upon
[53:05] the foundation of the Apostles and
[53:07] Prophets Jesus Christ
[53:10] himself being the Chief Cornerstone
[53:12] that's right in whom all the building
[53:16] Hey listen without a foundation and
[53:18] without a
[53:21] corner remember brother Brown said it's
[53:23] it's it's easy to make a straight line
[53:25] I can hand straight line but when you
[53:28] get into a corner to get that corner
[53:30] straight you got to have zerubabel with
[53:31] that plummet right to make everything
[53:34] where it'll square up because if you
[53:36] don't you'll get over there to the other
[53:37] end and you'll be off right every which
[53:40] way all right in whom all the building
[53:42] fitly framed together now there's the
[53:45] frame framed together
[53:47] groweth groweth that's an ongoing thing
[53:50] groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord
[53:53] and whom ye also are builded together
[53:57] for in habitation of God through the
[54:00] spirit amen so The Headstone has now
[54:03] become the Cornerstone all right put
[54:04] that up put the next one up just for
[54:07] illustration purposes and it's really
[54:09] neat to see that it
[54:12] is the head's down at the corner
[54:16] now everybody see that right is that
[54:19] okay that's what he means by being the
[54:21] Cornerstone he was the head he was the
[54:24] head a little pyramid in itself he was
[54:27] the head but now he's become the corner
[54:30] the one that laid the foundation it's
[54:32] the same love that you get at faith that
[54:34] you get up here it's not a different
[54:36] love it's a different level right or a
[54:39] different manifestation of that love all
[54:41] right so you got down here that's the
[54:43] Chief Cornerstone but now what he's
[54:45] going to do is in the end time he's not
[54:47] going to come from away from that and
[54:49] make that a circle or a square no but
[54:52] he's going to come right back up here to
[54:54] where he was amen amen and there then
[54:58] you say the the true token or the token
[55:00] came at the end time all right which was
[55:03] not just that we were covered by the
[55:05] blood that but that we are the blood by
[55:07] the spirit of God 1 Peter 2 and 1 now
[55:11] Peter continues now this is First Peter
[55:13] 2 and one the first one he written
[55:14] before wrote before he wrote the uh
[55:17] second
[55:20] Peter wherefore laying aside all malice
[55:23] and all G and hypocrisies and envies and
[55:27] all evil
[55:28] speaking as newborn babes desire the
[55:32] sincere me milk of the word that you may
[55:35] grow thereby so Peter brought him right
[55:38] back down to the
[55:39] foundation if so
[55:42] be that word if so be that you have
[55:45] tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom
[55:48] coming as into a living
[55:51] Stone disallowed indeed of men right
[55:55] headstone was rejected
[55:57] right of men disallowed indeed of men
[56:01] but chosen of God in Precious ye also as
[56:05] Lively stones are built up a spiritual
[56:09] house un holy priesthood to offer up
[56:12] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[56:16] by Jesus Christ wherefore also as also
[56:20] it is contained in the scripture behold
[56:23] I lay in Zion we read in Isaiah a Chief
[56:25] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[56:29] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[56:34] it's going to clear up a lot of things
[56:37] amen this statue of a perfect man to me
[56:39] if it's taught well and taught right it
[56:41] clears up a lot of things amen right
[56:45] unto you therefore which believe he is
[56:47] precious but unto them which be
[56:50] disobedient the stone which the builders
[56:53] disallowed the same as made head of the
[56:57] corner back back down there to the be to
[56:59] the beginning but watch what it becomes
[57:02] if you don't get into that
[57:05] stone okay that's what I've always said
[57:08] about the light a light can do two
[57:11] things a light can light your path or it
[57:13] can blind you right if you become the
[57:17] light as he is the light if you become
[57:18] the flashlight you can never have your
[57:20] light put out you can never be blinded
[57:23] if you become the flashlight right cuz
[57:25] the light's always in front of you but
[57:27] if you are not part of that and you're
[57:28] looking back into the light you're going
[57:30] to be blinded a stone of stumbling a
[57:33] rock of offense and even to them which
[57:36] stumble at the word amen ex that's what
[57:41] we see now in the end time and all down
[57:43] through they there's been there's been
[57:45] people come and go all through church
[57:46] ages this ain't something new that
[57:48] people are leaving the message no they
[57:51] left Luther's message they left Wesley's
[57:53] message they left Pentecost they left
[57:54] all different messages this is not
[57:56] something new the same devil just a
[57:58] different name right all right the
[58:01] people are dead and gone on but the
[58:02] devil he just had die he just came and
[58:03] jumped over in somebody else right A
[58:06] Stone of stumbling a rock of offence so
[58:08] in other words if we don't get into this
[58:10] if we don't get into this it actually is
[58:13] a stumbling Stone it is a rock of
[58:14] offense all right even to them which
[58:17] stumble at the word being
[58:21] disobedient now come on being disob
[58:26] obedient where unto also they were
[58:29] appointed right but ye are a chosen
[58:33] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[58:36] nation A peculiar people that you should
[58:40] show see where I got that show
[58:44] forth show it you got to show it
[58:48] outwardly show forth the praise of him
[58:51] who ha called you out of Darkness into
[58:54] his Marv marous light which in times
[58:56] past were not a people but are now the
[58:59] people of God there was one time that we
[59:02] were the people of the
[59:03] devil whatever you think about yourself
[59:06] you once were the devil's property amen
[59:09] but now you're the people of God right
[59:12] which had not obtained Mercy but now
[59:15] have
[59:16] obtained Mercy all right so we come to
[59:20] this place to where the stone can be a
[59:23] stone that is like
[59:26] um Dave Ramy made this analogy which I
[59:29] really enjoyed uh he said that a
[59:32] brick and I've told you many times
[59:34] before but some new ones here A brick is
[59:36] aoral you know you have moral and
[59:39] immoral right you have morals and you
[59:42] have
[59:43] immorality there's something in
[59:45] between it's called
[59:48] amoral a brick is aoral money is
[59:53] aoral money has no morals a gun is a
[59:56] moral a gun has no morals a gun doesn't
[59:58] arbitrarily shoot
[1:00:00] you it takes a hand of somebody to use
[1:00:03] it same way with a brick a brick is
[1:00:05] aoral you can take that brick and throw
[1:00:08] it through that window and cause a crime
[1:00:10] and be put in jail or you can take that
[1:00:12] same brick and build a hospital to house
[1:00:15] children that are sick so the brick is
[1:00:17] it's it's all in the hands of the user
[1:00:20] same thing with money money can be a sin
[1:00:23] or or a curse or it can be a blessing
[1:00:25] one of the two it's what you do with it
[1:00:27] same thing with these virtues same thing
[1:00:29] with God glory you stand with a choice
[1:00:35] to use what God's give you or not use
[1:00:37] what God give you
[1:00:40] okay I want us all to be
[1:00:43] skillful and have have not just the
[1:00:45] knowledge of the truth but let that
[1:00:47] truth flow through us and and I've seen
[1:00:50] in the Sunday school class and and not
[1:00:52] bragging on myself at all but in that
[1:00:54] Sunday school class seeing people be
[1:00:57] enlightened seeing people
[1:01:00] grow um seeing people become more aware
[1:01:04] at least if if if we sometimes as
[1:01:06] ministers we just try to make you
[1:01:08] aware we can't help you right we can
[1:01:13] guide you right but we can't help you
[1:01:17] right cuz I can say look the best way to
[1:01:19] go to Gainesville is right down here and
[1:01:20] go get on the interstate and somebody
[1:01:22] says no it's not you get out here and
[1:01:24] that's all Road well you can get to
[1:01:25] gangel the same way but you're going to
[1:01:26] get there 10 minutes quicker going that
[1:01:27] way than this way but you know what you
[1:01:29] got to choose which way you go same way
[1:01:32] with God we still as free moral agents
[1:01:34] up to the day we our bodies change we
[1:01:36] are free moral agents we make a choice
[1:01:40] whether to do the things of God or not
[1:01:42] and we get the promises or we get the
[1:01:44] woes one of the
[1:01:45] two amen we get the promises or the wo
[1:01:48] one of the two all right it's what we
[1:01:51] decide but we are now the people of God
[1:01:53] now let's go to
[1:01:55] Galatians
[1:02:03] 3
[1:02:07] 21 and we're going to let this is what
[1:02:09] we were reading last night in Sunday
[1:02:11] School in the Bible study and we we kind
[1:02:13] of got off of it a little bit cuz I said
[1:02:14] I'm going to cover it today but we
[1:02:16] starting in Galatians 3 and we're going
[1:02:18] to read right through Galatians
[1:02:20] 4 because this is what this is what's
[1:02:22] going to happen this is from our new
[1:02:25] birth and and how that God's going to
[1:02:27] raise us up Galatians 3:21 is the law
[1:02:30] then against the promises of
[1:02:32] God God
[1:02:35] forbid for if there had been a law given
[1:02:38] which could have given life very verily
[1:02:41] righteousness should have been by the
[1:02:43] law remember law was not life the way
[1:02:47] man took it you hear what I said the way
[1:02:50] man took it it was death because it was
[1:02:53] dos and don'ts all right but it's the
[1:02:55] way man took it that way but the
[1:02:57] scripture ha concluded all under
[1:03:02] sin pretty good isn't it none good know
[1:03:05] not
[1:03:06] one so if you think you were born with
[1:03:08] some Eternal something in you and your
[1:03:10] neighbor wasn't then God's a respect
[1:03:12] your persons and that scripture's dead I
[1:03:14] just like to see that we're all C we're
[1:03:16] all sin until God comes to me that's
[1:03:20] righteousness that's judgment that's
[1:03:22] everything uh that's pure of God
[1:03:25] is that he did not arbitrarily pick me
[1:03:29] over my neighbor just CU he wanted to
[1:03:33] cuz remember we come back to free moral
[1:03:35] agency we come back to our free moral
[1:03:38] ability to choose or to reject now God
[1:03:41] knowing we would choose he had it for us
[1:03:46] there where you call it seed or whatever
[1:03:48] I I just I just think we all born in sin
[1:03:51] we all born
[1:03:53] dead then God come that's right then the
[1:03:56] life of God
[1:03:58] come but the scripture ha concluded all
[1:04:01] under sin that the promise of faith of
[1:04:04] Jesus Christ might be given to what them
[1:04:08] that believe so there's a group that's
[1:04:11] going to believe and he's got it there
[1:04:12] for them to believe all right everybody
[1:04:15] all right say amen amen all right but
[1:04:18] before Faith
[1:04:20] came we were kept under the law dos and
[1:04:24] don't
[1:04:24] right we were kept under the law shut up
[1:04:28] unto the faith which should afterwards
[1:04:32] be revealed right all right wherefore
[1:04:36] the law was our school Master that's
[1:04:38] what we talking about last night back in
[1:04:41] the old times you had a school master or
[1:04:43] they used to call him a school mm it was
[1:04:46] the old woman or the old C you the a man
[1:04:49] that was not your
[1:04:51] teacher he was the school master right
[1:04:54] he was the head
[1:04:57] Deacon he was the one that kept you in
[1:05:00] line yeah if you got out of line the
[1:05:03] teacher would either send him to you
[1:05:04] kind of like the principal of today the
[1:05:06] the the the teacher would send them to
[1:05:08] the principal
[1:05:12] well the wherefore the law was our
[1:05:14] school Master to bring us unto Christ
[1:05:18] but it couldn't get us in Christ okay
[1:05:21] cuz it wasn't the teacher cuz we're
[1:05:23] going to cover that in just a minute
[1:05:25] okay so the law like I said the here's
[1:05:28] the law the law is out
[1:05:31] here right dos and
[1:05:33] don'ts do this don't do that even in
[1:05:35] justification and sanctification it is
[1:05:38] dos and don'ts
[1:05:40] right was for me it's got to be for you
[1:05:42] same thing we all become lawgivers when
[1:05:46] we become religious right but when we
[1:05:48] get born again we try to pick up a
[1:05:50] little bit of Grace but before Faith
[1:05:53] came we were kept under the the law shut
[1:05:54] up un the faith that would be afterward
[1:05:56] be revealed wherefore the law was our
[1:05:58] school Master to bring us unto Christ
[1:06:02] that we might be justified by faith
[1:06:07] right but after that faith has come
[1:06:10] we're no longer under School
[1:06:13] Master it's When Faith
[1:06:16] Comes we're no longer under School
[1:06:19] Master right no longer under School
[1:06:23] master for ye are the children of God by
[1:06:26] faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you
[1:06:30] has been baptized into Christ have put
[1:06:31] on Christ now remember Paul watch He's
[1:06:35] continuing this thought that's why I
[1:06:36] want to continue to read this there's
[1:06:37] neither Jew or Greek Bond or free male
[1:06:40] or female for you are all one in Jesus
[1:06:42] or Christ Jesus and if ye be Christ then
[1:06:45] are you Abraham's seed and heirs
[1:06:47] according to the promise there's your
[1:06:50] new
[1:06:51] birth now I say that the heir aans 4:1
[1:06:54] continue the thought keep going
[1:06:58] 4:1 now I say that the heir as long as
[1:07:02] he is a child dith nothing from a
[1:07:05] servant though he be Lord of all now
[1:07:08] once you get born again right here at
[1:07:10] Faith you are a son and daughter of God
[1:07:13] Amen you are in the Kingdom you are a
[1:07:17] bride you are the elect lady you are
[1:07:21] Eternal in your soul
[1:07:25] right there's a lot of things goes with
[1:07:27] that just getting in the
[1:07:31] Kingdom but I say that the heir as long
[1:07:33] as he's a child now
[1:07:36] look what did the prodal son do he was a
[1:07:39] son he was an heir he went out and
[1:07:44] privilously spent his money and did all
[1:07:47] the things of the world
[1:07:49] right he didn't obtain this he was a son
[1:07:53] but he did but remember he came
[1:07:56] back all right he came back and he was
[1:08:00] restored amen but watch that the heir as
[1:08:04] long as he's a child differeth nothing
[1:08:07] from a servant right though he be Lord
[1:08:09] of
[1:08:11] all but is under
[1:08:14] tutors and
[1:08:16] governors until the time appointed of
[1:08:19] the father
[1:08:21] amen even so we when we were children
[1:08:25] were in bondage under the
[1:08:27] elements of the world that's right
[1:08:31] okay but when the fullness of the time
[1:08:35] was
[1:08:36] come God sent forth his son made of a
[1:08:39] woman made under the law to redeem them
[1:08:42] that were under the law that we might
[1:08:43] receive the adoption of sons now
[1:08:46] remember down here we receive the spirit
[1:08:49] of adoption Romans
[1:08:51] 8 right Romans 8 we receive the the
[1:08:53] spirit of adoption we're in line we're
[1:08:55] in air right we're in line to be adopted
[1:09:00] all right not an adoption like today
[1:09:02] that's different from adoption back then
[1:09:04] adoption today of today is of course
[1:09:07] many different things but the adoption
[1:09:09] in the Old Testament was you took a son
[1:09:12] and like brother brandom Illustrated he
[1:09:14] said he said here's the father of course
[1:09:17] the trinitarians love this here's the
[1:09:19] father setting up in the Kingdom and The
[1:09:20] Holy Ghost comes to him and said why two
[1:09:22] of them but the holy ghost would come
[1:09:24] he's given an illustration he just given
[1:09:27] an illustration so that we can
[1:09:28] understand it okay it's an
[1:09:30] illustration the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:09:32] tells the father oh dick Addison you
[1:09:35] ought to see him he's doing well I don't
[1:09:37] think the father don't see that it's an
[1:09:39] illustration right right but now oh look
[1:09:42] at wayale he's over there he's doing
[1:09:44] things bad you know father's you know
[1:09:47] that's why the scripture says you can
[1:09:49] grieve the Holy Spirit even though you
[1:09:50] have the Holy Spirit you can grieve it
[1:09:53] you can grieve it so bad you'll not get
[1:09:54] those virtues not all of them anyway
[1:09:57] right but you still are a child of God
[1:09:59] you say well what do I need then I'm I'm
[1:10:01] Eternal what I need anything see if you
[1:10:03] got that attitude I don't think you are
[1:10:04] right
[1:10:06] right I don't think you are if you got
[1:10:08] that if I'm if I become if I
[1:10:13] realized just just let me let me give
[1:10:16] you an analysis here if I was if I found
[1:10:19] out today that I was the son of Bill
[1:10:22] Gates now I know what Dad said but let
[1:10:25] me use this analogy if I found out I was
[1:10:27] the very direct son of Bill Gates I'd
[1:10:29] want some
[1:10:31] money cuz he is my
[1:10:34] daddy right but same way with God here
[1:10:38] we come down through the world and we're
[1:10:39] the Father the devil I mean the devil's
[1:10:41] our daddy right Devil's our
[1:10:44] daddy then one day we
[1:10:47] realize come to an altar give our heart
[1:10:50] to God and we realize that that Kingdom
[1:10:52] has changed right
[1:10:55] that Kingdom has changed and now it
[1:10:56] takes on a different look right well let
[1:10:59] me tell you something just as you wanted
[1:11:01] everything that the devil had when you
[1:11:03] was doing his bidding I want everything
[1:11:06] that the Eternal God has everything
[1:11:09] without
[1:11:11] limitation I mean we wanted to drink and
[1:11:14] smoke and do the things of the world we
[1:11:15] wanted to do that don't tell me you
[1:11:17] didn't whing around with women and all
[1:11:19] the different things we wanted to do
[1:11:20] that or we wouldn't have done it but now
[1:11:23] that we we come to a place where God has
[1:11:25] took that nature
[1:11:27] out give us a new
[1:11:29] nature his nature Glory we got a kingdom
[1:11:34] now that's full of promises right we got
[1:11:36] a kingdom now that that not even the
[1:11:40] great Apostle
[1:11:42] Paul could teach and put it together
[1:11:46] even like you and I can
[1:11:49] today amen I heard a preacher one time
[1:11:52] preach that Paul had everything we had I
[1:11:54] don't agree with that I don't agree with
[1:11:57] that cuz Paul didn't have that statue of
[1:11:59] a perfect man with the headstone he
[1:12:01] didn't have a son of man Revelation
[1:12:02] right the son of man Revelation is only
[1:12:05] people to us in the end time to change
[1:12:08] our bodies that's what the son of man
[1:12:10] Revelation because remember the Son of
[1:12:12] God doesn't need a body
[1:12:16] change right son of God's God Amen Son
[1:12:20] of God don't need a body change the son
[1:12:22] of man needed a body Chang and he got
[1:12:25] one because the Son of God was in that
[1:12:28] son of man and he yielded himself to
[1:12:31] that
[1:12:33] personen what's the difference between
[1:12:35] me and you right if we're hes Romans 8
[1:12:38] says we're HS and join HS with Christ
[1:12:40] that doesn't mean he's up here we're
[1:12:41] down here that means join HS whatever
[1:12:43] he's got we can get
[1:12:47] amen but is under tutors and governors
[1:12:49] until the time appointed of the father
[1:12:52] even so we we were children were in
[1:12:54] bondage of the elements of the world but
[1:12:56] when the fullness of the time was come
[1:12:59] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:13:01] made under the law to redeem them that
[1:13:04] were under the law that we might receive
[1:13:06] the adoption of sons and because ye are
[1:13:10] Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of
[1:13:13] his son into your hearts crying Daddy
[1:13:16] Daddy all
[1:13:18] right wherefore Thou Art no more a
[1:13:21] servant but a son son and if a son then
[1:13:25] an heir of God through Christ an heir of
[1:13:30] God through Christ so if if if Jesus
[1:13:33] Christ had got eternal life and Jesus
[1:13:36] Christ was these virtues if you have
[1:13:37] Jesus Christ in you then it will make
[1:13:39] you the Bible says it will make
[1:13:41] you that you will neither be baren or
[1:13:43] unfruitful all right so we're going to
[1:13:45] read one quote and then we're going to
[1:13:46] stop I kind of Promise myself I try not
[1:13:48] to go about an hour and 10 minutes this

[1:15:32] precious Faith through us with us
[1:15:34] through the righteousness of God and our
[1:15:36] Savior Jesus Christ he's reading the
[1:15:37] scripture now he's going to comment I

[1:15:42] my whole subject this morning is based
[1:15:44] on faith see let me read that again

[1:15:57] saying that I have obtained this faith
[1:15:59] and I'm addressing this to them that has
[1:16:02] obtained that light precious faith I
[1:16:05] want it's not to the outside world GL
[1:16:09] this is to the church see those that are
[1:16:11] in Christ am all right Grace and peace
[1:16:15] be multiplied unto you through the
[1:16:16] knowledge of God through through of
[1:16:18] Jesus Christ Our Lord now he's this he's

[1:16:21] scripture according to his divine power
[1:16:24] has given unto us all things his divine
[1:16:26] power now has given unto us all things
[1:16:27] that pertain unto life godliness through
[1:16:29] the knowledge of him that's called us to
[1:16:31] glory and virtue whereby are we given
[1:16:33] unto given unto us exceeding great and
[1:16:36] precious promises that by these he and
[1:16:38] he comments these promises all right
[1:16:40] down here these promises we might be
[1:16:42] partakers of the divine nature now let's
[1:16:45] go on to paragraph
[1:16:46] 36 now let that soak in real deep now
[1:16:49] not preaching this morning we just
[1:16:51] teaching this lesson divine div nature
[1:16:53] see that's his lesson is divine nature
[1:16:55] that is the divine nature of God by the
[1:16:57] way let me read that fourth verse again
[1:17:00] so you won't miss it whereby we are
[1:17:01] given whereby are given unto us
[1:17:04] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:17:06] that by these these promises we might be
[1:17:08] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:17:10] escaped the corruption that is in the
[1:17:11] world through lust see the world we've
[1:17:14] escaped that now he's addressing this to
[1:17:17] the church that's why we're here this
[1:17:20] morning is to find out what is the way
[1:17:24] Glory what is God's requirement right
[1:17:28] there's not a person in here that loves
[1:17:30] God but wants to become more like Christ
[1:17:33] now it's laid out here
[1:17:36] amen every Christian I'm an old veteran
[1:17:39] look at brother and sister kid they're
[1:17:40] probably the oldest in the building but
[1:17:41] if I ask them what's in your heart's
[1:17:42] desire it'd be closer to God when you
[1:17:45] learn of Christ there's something about
[1:17:47] him that's so loving you just try to get
[1:17:51] right into him amen so that's what I
[1:17:53] mean about desire if if we have a desire
[1:17:57] God will fill it amen if if we have a
[1:17:59] desire just to come to church
[1:18:01] and brother juel and I were talking
[1:18:03] about something the other day and we
[1:18:04] were talking about a social gospel and
[1:18:05] that's exactly what's happening around
[1:18:06] the message people are just preaching a
[1:18:08] social gospel come to church just like
[1:18:10] the denominations and sing two or three
[1:18:12] songs and or what more not saying what
[1:18:15] we do I'm saying what they they go they
[1:18:17] have the doxology they sing a few songs
[1:18:19] they have this they say the preacher
[1:18:20] gets up he talks for 15 minutes and they
[1:18:22] go home
[1:18:28] ain't much what we don't do what we
[1:18:31] do this is given to us to move
[1:18:36] with to move up in God with let's stand
[1:18:40] if your desire is to move up with God
[1:18:43] because this whole thing begins with a
[1:18:45] desire where that you want to be
[1:18:49] fruitful and abound and all those great
[1:18:52] things divine nature come on musicians
[1:18:55] if you want that then God's here to give
[1:18:57] it to youen but if you want to just be
[1:19:00] somebody just sits in church and just
[1:19:02] you know says amen every once in a while
[1:19:04] and you know you can be that but you're
[1:19:08] not going to be
[1:19:09] fruitful God wants somebody he can use
[1:19:12] and I'll promise you one thing let me
[1:19:14] nail this down real good you will not
[1:19:16] take a body change if you do not have
[1:19:18] these virtues working in your life amen
[1:19:21] you will not take a body change if you
[1:19:24] do not have these virtues working in
[1:19:25] your life you are headed to a
[1:19:28] grave that's to all of us if you don't
[1:19:31] have those virtues working in your life
[1:19:34] you're headed to a grave
[1:19:37] right think about that amen so are those
[1:19:41] a requirement right absolutely they're a
[1:19:43] requirement to me it's life and death
[1:19:46] right it's a life and death requirement
[1:19:48] but you know what God never gives a man
[1:19:51] a requirement that that he doesn't make
[1:19:53] a way to get out of
[1:19:56] that woe part of the
[1:19:58] requirement God never does that he's
[1:20:00] never give anybody and says well that's
[1:20:03] just it you're done you're finished no
[1:20:07] he says he well word
[1:20:10] if if you believe in
[1:20:13] me you'll have everlasting life let's
[1:20:16] power our
[1:20:19] heads de heavenly father thank you Lord
