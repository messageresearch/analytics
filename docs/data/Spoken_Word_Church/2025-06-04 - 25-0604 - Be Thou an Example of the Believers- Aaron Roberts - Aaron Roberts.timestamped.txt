[0:00] Amen.
[0:02] And just appreciate the Lord. And if you
[0:04] have your Bibles tonight, we're going to
[0:06] turn to First Timothy chapter
[0:09] 4. And begin verse 12. Very familiar
[0:14] scripture. And uh just uh let's just all
[0:18] bow our heads and before we read the
[0:21] scripture tonight. Heavenly Father, we
[0:23] thank you for this day, Lord. We thank
[0:24] you all your blessings. We just pray
[0:26] that you just come amongst us tonight,
[0:28] Lord. speak to to our hearts, Lord. Just
[0:30] give us what we have need of today,
[0:32] Lord. Give us today our daily bread.
[0:35] Lord, just bless each one that's here,
[0:37] the ones that couldn't be here tonight,
[0:38] Lord Jesus. Whatever the needs are,
[0:40] Lord, we know that you are the answer to
[0:42] whatever we have need of, Lord. Lord, we
[0:44] just commit ourselves to you. And Lord,
[0:47] just have your will and wait with us in
[0:48] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[0:52] Amen. 1 Timothy chapter 4 beginning at
[0:54] verse 12 says, "Let no man despise thy
[0:56] youth, but be thou an example of the
[0:58] believers in word, in
[1:01] conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
[1:04] faith, in purity."
[1:06] He says, "Till I come, give attendance
[1:08] to reading, to exhortation, to
[1:11] doctrine, and neglect not the spirit
[1:13] that is in thee, which was given thee by
[1:16] prophecy, which with the
[1:18] land own of the hands of the
[1:23] preser. Meditate upon these things, give
[1:26] thyself holy to them, that thy profiting
[1:28] may appear to
[1:30] all. Take heed unto thyself and unto thy
[1:34] doctrine. Continue them. For in doing
[1:36] this, thou shalt both save thyself and
[1:39] them that hear thee. Amen. God bless you
[1:42] tonight. You may be seated. And
[1:45] uh I want to speak on be thou an example
[1:50] of the believers.
[1:57] And you know you look here in the
[1:59] scripture and Paul's writing to Timothy
[2:03] this young Christian as young minister
[2:07] and you know no doubt Timothy might have
[2:11] faced
[2:12] some problems and you know
[2:17] uh pressure
[2:20] um you know probably looked over him and
[2:24] uh didn't regard him as as somebody that
[2:28] he was in the position that God had
[2:29] called him to. And you know he and
[2:32] here's here's Paul telling him but be an
[2:34] example of the believers. And you know
[2:36] one of the first things that you know
[2:38] when he was speaking you know don't
[2:41] don't look at the things that are around
[2:43] you whatever that's happened to you but
[2:45] he said be an example of a believer. And
[2:47] one of the things that always struck me
[2:49] about reading this scripture is Paul
[2:51] never tells Timothy to look at him. He
[2:53] says be be an example of the believers,
[2:55] don't be an example of me. Don't try to
[2:58] copy me. Don't try to try to do what I
[3:00] do. Don't you know this this is not
[3:02] cloning. This is this is you know Paul
[3:04] was who he was. Timothy was who he is.
[3:07] And you be who you are but you be who
[3:09] you are in Christ. And he said, "But be
[3:11] an example of Christ, but be an example
[3:13] of the believers." Because of the
[3:15] different believers that you've seen,
[3:17] the the ones that have carried the
[3:18] faith, the ones that are upholding the
[3:20] faith, said, "You be an example of
[3:22] them." And you know, Brother Ram, you
[3:24] know, we are to be an example to
[3:27] everybody. We are we are to be an
[3:28] example, you know, we're to be examples
[3:30] to the world, to the to the youth, you
[3:34] know, we're supposed to be an example to
[3:35] each other, to everybody around us.
[3:38] We're supposed to be an example. All
[3:39] right. And you know, and
[3:43] and it it it it behooves us to be in in
[3:46] the hour which the day and hour we live
[3:49] where we're at right now. You know, it's
[3:51] not time to play games or anything like
[3:53] that. But, you know, we we need to be
[3:54] totally sold out on who God is. Excuse
[3:58] me. And what we're doing and what we
[4:01] believe. Amen. Today, today is the day
[4:04] of salvation. And we don't have we don't
[4:06] have another day because you know not
[4:07] none of us this this afternoon are
[4:09] promised tomorrow. None of us are
[4:11] promised in the morning. We're not even
[4:13] promised tonight because right now is
[4:16] the day of checking up. We don't have we
[4:18] don't have another second, another
[4:19] minute because we don't know when God's
[4:21] going to call for us. But you know what?
[4:22] We've always got to be ready at all time
[4:25] and everything. And
[4:29] we need to be an example
[4:32] of of what we believe. We need to
[4:34] manifest what we believe and we ought to
[4:36] live what we believe. Brother Brandham
[4:38] said, you know, he said because he said,
[4:39] I'd rather you live me a sermon than
[4:41] preach me one because you know what? If
[4:43] you're going to if you're going to have
[4:44] it, he said because that's a better
[4:46] evidence of being a Christian is if you
[4:48] live if you live what you believe, don't
[4:50] don't preach it, just live it because
[4:53] that's what because he said, you know,
[4:54] each one of us can be a preacher by we
[4:56] call because we're going to preach the
[4:58] gospel through our lives. We're going to
[4:59] manifest who we are and we've got to
[5:01] live a sermon. He said, that's what we
[5:03] do. He said, "Our actions show what we
[5:05] are." And so if we if we actually be
[5:07] believe to be Christians, if we're going
[5:09] to be a Christian, and if this is what
[5:10] we believe, then you know what? It's
[5:12] time to manifest what we are. Because
[5:14] you know what? It's it's time to lay
[5:15] aside every sin and every weight and
[5:18] everything that will will discourage you
[5:21] and take you off course and lay aside
[5:23] every weight that'll so easily beset us
[5:25] and run the race set before us. That we
[5:28] should just continue to run. And no
[5:30] matter how hard the trials get or know
[5:31] how things come or or go our way, you
[5:33] know what? We are to run and run with
[5:35] with confidence and run with faith and
[5:38] run with vigor and run with zeal because
[5:40] you know we shouldn't be stopped by
[5:41] anything. We shouldn't should because if
[5:43] we see the day and hour which we live
[5:45] then thank God because I do believe that
[5:47] the coming of the Lord is closer today
[5:49] than it ever has been. Then if it's
[5:51] closer today than it was yesterday, then
[5:53] it's something that we ought to have
[5:54] more confidence in what we're doing
[5:56] today than we did yesterday. that we
[5:58] ought to be sold out more today to the
[6:00] word of God than we were yesterday. And
[6:02] you know, we we should lay aside all
[6:04] these things and not worry about these
[6:06] things because if we're not totally sold
[6:08] out to the word of God, then we need to
[6:09] get in the altar and pray because we
[6:10] need to get ready because today is the
[6:13] day that you've got to get ready. If
[6:15] you're not ready to go because you know
[6:17] there's there's many people that you
[6:19] know they because Satan is working
[6:21] today. He is on the rampage. And one
[6:23] thing he wants to do is he wants to rock
[6:25] you to sleep. He just wants everybody to
[6:27] just think everything's okay and you can
[6:29] just have have your your you're just
[6:31] easy living. You know, any any dead fish
[6:34] can float downstream, but it takes a
[6:36] really life one that's going to fight to
[6:38] fight upstream to get to the place that
[6:40] we got to go to. And if you're going to
[6:42] fight, you got to go and know where
[6:43] you're going. Because if you know where
[6:45] you're going, then you know what? You've
[6:47] got to know how to get there. And let me
[6:48] tell you, he said Jesus said, "I am the
[6:50] way, the truth, and the life." And he
[6:52] said, "No one can come to me but by but
[6:54] the father. Nobody can come but this way
[6:56] but by me. Your only way that you're
[6:58] going to get there is by me. And he he
[7:01] sent us the way, showed us the way, and
[7:03] told us how we're going to come. And
[7:04] we've got to know who we are and where
[7:06] we're going and how to get there. And
[7:09] and today is the day. And brother Brown
[7:11] was talking in the message why. And he
[7:14] was talking about Paul and
[7:17] Timothy said talking about stirring up
[7:19] the gift that he had in his
[7:22] life. and said he said he was he was
[7:26] speaking of of the of the gift that
[7:28] Timothy had in his life and he was
[7:30] talking about it come through his
[7:31] grandmother Lois and and he he was
[7:34] speaking of paying Levi paying tithe to
[7:37] Melzdc through
[7:40] Abraham and so he was talking how how
[7:42] this is a generational thing and he says
[7:44] brother Brand was talking about see it
[7:46] was accounted to Levi to paying Melzdc
[7:50] tithe because of his great-grandfather
[7:52] it was accounted to him for paying ti
[7:54] and brother Bram says your life will
[7:56] impress your children he said you have
[7:58] in influenced your children by the
[8:00] example you set before them and I think
[8:02] it's a good thing that we put every
[8:04] effort we can before our children as
[8:06] godly parents he said make an example be
[8:09] an example so if you look here he was
[8:12] talking about our lives and the things
[8:14] that we ought to be doing well first off
[8:16] it takes to have parents that
[8:20] are living the right kind of life.
[8:23] They're living the kind of life in front
[8:25] of their children. And brother Brown
[8:27] continues because you know the the first
[8:30] example that you're going to have as a
[8:32] as a child, the first example we have is
[8:34] our parents. The biggest example that we
[8:36] have is our parents. You know, brother
[8:38] Ramb talked about the fifth gospel being
[8:40] mom.
[8:42] You know that's you're going to you're
[8:44] going to have a moream more influence
[8:47] upon your children than anybody else.
[8:49] And you know, we you know, because today
[8:51] that we the hour which we live, we see
[8:53] it and it started way back. But you
[8:55] know, you see all these people, they're
[8:56] expecting somebody else to raise their
[8:58] children. There's some they're waiting
[8:59] for somebody else to solve all their
[9:01] problems. But you know what? It takes it
[9:03] takes it takes place in the home. It the
[9:07] life that's lived in the home is what is
[9:09] the example that that they need. And you
[9:11] know, because you see a lot of things
[9:14] that have went on and brother Brandon
[9:16] was talking about, you know, the the
[9:18] condition that the world is in
[9:22] today. He was talking about, you know,
[9:24] the condition that the world has gotten
[9:26] into today. And we see the condition.
[9:28] This was back in the in the 50s and 60s,
[9:30] but he was talking about how terrible it
[9:32] was. And, you know, he was talking about
[9:34] how, you know, the the women and the the
[9:36] immoral condition that the women were
[9:39] in. And he he was talking about he the
[9:41] condition that the world had gotten into
[9:42] because he said this is America's God.
[9:44] It's a woman and you know she can send
[9:46] more men to hell than all the bootleg
[9:48] joints in the in the country. But you
[9:50] know, but that's he said but the devil
[9:52] knows what he's doing. He said he's he's
[9:54] he knows that in the beginning he said
[9:57] that's the reason he chose the woman. He
[9:59] said now the woman is redeemed and she
[10:01] can be a sister and godly. But brother
[10:03] what we need today is some real good
[10:05] oldfashioned God sent Holy Ghostborn
[10:07] mothers to raise children. Right? He
[10:10] said, "Talk about juvenile delinquency.
[10:12] It's parent delinquency is where it lays
[10:14] out." He said, "That's exactly right."
[10:17] And so, you know, it it start it starts
[10:18] in the home. It starts with mom, but
[10:21] then continuing on, Brother Benham said
[10:23] that he said the problem has been is
[10:25] because the people that are standing
[10:27] behind the pullpit, he said the
[10:28] preachers have let down on the word. And
[10:30] he said that he said we he said he said
[10:33] let me he said, "Brother, let me tell
[10:34] you something." Hey, I said I say if the
[10:37] preacher behind the pulpit would have
[10:39] stayed with the old-fashioned gospel and
[10:42] God kept the thing straight, we wouldn't
[10:44] have so much of this juvenile
[10:46] delinquency and everything else that we
[10:48] have got today and the trouble we got.
[10:50] God still looks down upon that. And he
[10:53] said and see he said how can you preach
[10:55] divine healing and the power of God when
[10:58] you associate with such as that? You
[11:00] can't do it. He said oil and water won't
[11:02] mix. He and he said because he was
[11:05] talking about he said, "Well, brother
[11:06] Bam, you're trying to be a legalist." He
[11:08] said, "I'm not trying to be a legalist."
[11:09] He said, "I'm preaching the gospel." He
[11:11] said, "I'm not taking sides." He said,
[11:13] "I'm preaching what the gospels is
[11:15] because this is what the truth is." And
[11:17] so, you know, he was talking about what
[11:18] we need is is good old-fashioned homes.
[11:21] And he said, "That's where the problem
[11:22] is." Is because brother Rand was
[11:24] speaking to the young people uh one
[11:26] time, you know, he's talking about, you
[11:26] know, the mother, he said, "You people,
[11:28] you know, you're going to raise up.
[11:29] You're going to be the fathers and
[11:30] mothers of the next generation that's
[11:32] coming on." And you know what you do
[11:34] today is going to have an influence on
[11:35] the next generation. What takes place,
[11:37] the kind of live life that you live, how
[11:39] your children are going to be and the
[11:41] things that you let slide. But you know,
[11:44] we need to have a fervor, a zeal in
[11:46] front of our children that we need to be
[11:47] totally sold out to not allow Satan to
[11:50] have one foothold, one toe hold on
[11:53] anything in our lives. We need to make
[11:54] sure that he is totally cleared out.
[11:59] I don't I don't want the devil to have
[12:00] any kind of hold on me. I don't want him
[12:02] to have any kind of hold on my family. I
[12:04] don't want to have anything. But, you
[12:05] know, but you've got to set the example
[12:07] and you've got to hold hold the word up.
[12:08] You got to have the standard there. And
[12:10] whether anybody likes it or not, that's
[12:12] that's immaterial. That's not that
[12:14] doesn't matter. Because you know what?
[12:16] I'm going to hold the standard. I'm I
[12:18] say this is wrong and that's right. And
[12:20] that's what it's that's way going to be,
[12:24] you know, because because being a parent
[12:26] is not a popularity contest. You're not
[12:28] going to be popular with your with your
[12:30] decisions. But you know what? But the
[12:31] only thing is is you've got to answer to
[12:33] God for the but for the for the choices
[12:35] that you made and the rules that you
[12:37] make and the standards you set. God's
[12:39] going to require you an answer of you.
[12:41] And the thing is is the person that he
[12:43] requires an answer from is the head of
[12:45] the house.
[12:47] Because you know the thing is is
[12:49] everybody talks about women and I'm just
[12:53] going to preach today and and I I'm just
[12:55] going to preach and if it falls the
[12:57] chips fall where they may, I'm just
[12:58] going to get this off my heart today.
[13:00] But let me tell you something, you know,
[13:01] ever, you know, because you see women
[13:02] today and they're and they're like,
[13:03] "Well, you know, my wife my husband's
[13:06] the head of the house and I'm I'm the
[13:08] wife and you know, and and he's going to
[13:10] answer for me." Yeah, Brother Brandon
[13:11] did say, "But you the thing is is you
[13:13] know, I I just going to say this, but
[13:16] let me tell you something. If a if a if
[13:18] a god-ent man stands up, if a husband
[13:20] stands up and sets the standard and
[13:22] tells you what the standard is, if you
[13:24] go out and do whatever you want to, then
[13:25] you the wife answers for that because
[13:28] you know what? when the standard has
[13:29] been set because let me tell you
[13:31] something when Christ set the standard
[13:33] for in the church then you know what you
[13:35] have to be under headship and if you're
[13:37] out from under headship then you answer
[13:39] for it because the sin stays upon your
[13:42] head the only place that that Eve could
[13:45] have been fortified was behind the word
[13:48] when she stood behind the word see if
[13:50] she had been behind her headship which
[13:53] was Adam which was God who give her Adam
[13:56] if she' have stayed there instead of
[13:58] listening to some ro Tommy rot she would
[14:01] have been fortified behind the word
[14:05] and see the problem is everybody wants
[14:07] to live because what did brother
[14:08] Brandham say he said in the last days he
[14:10] said there'd be seven women latch on to
[14:12] one man and say let us eat our own food
[14:15] wear on our apparel do our own thing but
[14:17] let us be called by your name
[14:20] what is it people want to be called
[14:22] Christian but they don't want to live
[14:24] the life they don't want to hold the
[14:26] standard they don't want to believe what
[14:27] the word says, but it takes living the
[14:30] life. It takes towing the line.
[14:34] See, you got to know what the word is,
[14:36] and you've got to hold the line. Amen.
[14:38] You can't just do whatever you want to.
[14:44] He said, "God, give us oldfashioned,
[14:47] born again, sainted, godly homes,
[14:49] juvenile delinquency, we be no more." It
[14:52] isn't juvenile delinquency, it's parent
[14:54] delinquency. Yes, sir. He said they had
[14:57] the old woodshed and the big hickory
[14:59] lamb laying over the door. He said
[15:01] that's discipline in our home. See, the
[15:04] problem is is nobody knows what
[15:05] discipline is anymore.
[15:09] You know, because the problem is is, you
[15:11] know, everybody wants to read Dr. Spock
[15:13] and and Dr. Dobson and Dr. Seuss and who
[15:16] everybody else and you know and they
[15:18] always want to find some kind of try try
[15:20] to find some kind of psychology you know
[15:23] because they think you know we're going
[15:24] to have well you know because you know
[15:25] what you're going to mess up their
[15:27] psyche if you paddle their rear ends.
[15:31] Well you know y'all don't have to say
[15:34] amen. I'm going to preach anyway. But
[15:35] you know the thing is but you know but
[15:37] you know the problem is you know what
[15:38] God ra God started this thing. He wrote
[15:41] it in the word and you know what he
[15:42] started and you know what he raised many
[15:44] people but by by doing the right thing
[15:48] and the Bible tells us you know if you
[15:50] get a if you get something after them
[15:51] and you paddle their rearing said they
[15:53] won't die. That's right
[15:56] because you know what it's correction.
[15:58] It ain't it because you know if you go
[15:59] at it with malice
[16:02] or vengeance you know because you're not
[16:04] doing it correctly
[16:06] because you know what God doesn't
[16:08] correct us that way
[16:11] and you know and you know sometimes you
[16:12] know it makes your blood boil.
[16:17] Okay I'm going to preach today I'm going
[16:19] to preach I'm I'm going to tell you it
[16:20] makes my blood boil. Yes.
[16:24] The Bible says, "Lay hands suddenly on
[16:26] on no man." Well, you know, I just feel
[16:28] like going,
[16:33] but you know what it it does. I mean,
[16:35] but you know what? Because no matter
[16:37] what you do, you you it'll drive you up
[16:41] to you will try to tell them and talk to
[16:42] them. And you know what? Sometimes
[16:44] that's what it takes. You got to get a
[16:46] hold of them
[16:48] because they will they're gonna go
[16:50] straight. They're gonna do their
[16:51] whatever they want to and the only way
[16:52] that you gonna stop them, the only way
[16:53] you gonna turn them around is sometimes
[16:55] you got to get, as brother Brandham
[16:56] said, you got to give them some of that
[16:57] posterior protoplasmic stimulation.
[17:00] That's right.
[17:02] Sometimes you got to get a hold of
[17:04] because you know what? Their brains are
[17:05] not up here anymore.
[17:08] They got to have a reset
[17:10] button. And sometimes that's what it
[17:12] takes. But you know what? People don't
[17:13] don't have that anymore. And the problem
[17:16] is is like, you know, I suffered through
[17:18] that as a as the saying is, you know, I
[17:20] suffered through that growing up, you
[17:22] know, where my parents battled me and
[17:24] you know what I ended up with? I ended
[17:25] up with a whole lot of respect for my
[17:27] elders. I started I had a lot of respect
[17:29] for those that were in charge over me.
[17:33] And the problem is is nobody has any
[17:35] respect for anybody because they didn't
[17:36] have to go through that.
[17:39] Because you got you got kids that are
[17:41] less than 10 years old and they run the
[17:43] house.
[17:46] They get to they get to make all the
[17:47] decisions.
[17:53] And we and and people wonder what
[17:55] happened. Well, you know, this was way
[17:56] back in the 50s and 60s. Everybody
[17:58] started writing books. You know, we have
[18:00] to, you know, we got to pet them and we
[18:02] got to do this. And now, now we got
[18:05] people that are stand up that's got more
[18:07] letters behind their name than, you
[18:09] know, half the alphabet back there. you
[18:12] know, all these PhDs and all kinds of
[18:14] different, you know, they they've spent
[18:16] their entire life in some kind of
[18:18] institution and some kind of educational
[18:21] system. You know, they went to these
[18:22] great universities and had all this
[18:24] training and then they stand up and want
[18:26] to tell you that you need to ask your
[18:28] baby if it's okay to change their
[18:34] diaper. Just like brother Brandham out
[18:36] there talking about, you know, with
[18:38] Junior Dear, we're in we're in a high
[18:40] class society. We're we're one of the
[18:42] modern families. Son, we're going to
[18:44] give you this little bell. We're going
[18:45] to set it next to your crib and when you
[18:47] need anything, Brother Bam tells a story
[18:50] about, "Look, Junior, if you need
[18:51] anything, you just ring the bell and
[18:52] your mama will come in there and take
[18:54] care of your needs." He said, "But
[18:56] that's not the way God provided. That's
[18:58] not the that wasn't God's provided way.
[19:00] That was the way nature because if the
[19:02] baby needs something, it's going to cry
[19:04] out for it. And that's the only way it
[19:06] knows how to get it somebody's attention
[19:08] that it needs something is to cry out.
[19:10] And he said that's exactly the way it
[19:12] same would be. You're not you can't have
[19:14] some dry eye confession. You can't have
[19:16] some shaken hands and try to come to
[19:19] some mental condition, some middle idea,
[19:21] the middle conception of this how it's
[19:23] going to be. It's going to take a new
[19:25] birth and it's going to take a dying out
[19:27] to you and a rebirth by Jesus Christ.
[19:30] It's not because you know it doesn't
[19:32] change. Everybody wants to change how
[19:33] the new birth is preached and what the
[19:36] what the new birth is. Well, you know
[19:37] what? It's the same thing that took
[19:38] place from the beginning again from from
[19:40] Acts two all the way to today. It's the
[19:42] exact same thing. It's the exact same
[19:44] formula. And the only way that you come
[19:47] is the same way they came.
[19:50] It's a birth of the word.
[19:54] See, we need we need
[19:56] that. He said, brother Ram says, "Oh, we
[19:59] shouldn't hear that kind of stuff." He
[20:01] said, "You should hear it." That's
[20:02] right. Amen. He said, "You don't let God
[20:05] in that private life. You won't let him
[20:07] in those little sails, little cell of
[20:10] yours on the
[20:12] inside." See, we just want to come to a
[20:14] certain place, but you know, we just we
[20:15] just want to we we we have our
[20:18] little defenses set up. We're just going
[20:22] to allow we're just going to allow God
[20:23] into certain areas. And we've got we've
[20:25] got our preconceived ideas how far we're
[20:27] going to allow God to
[20:29] move because, you know, we don't we
[20:31] don't mind the Lord working on these
[20:33] areas, but not not over here now. We
[20:35] don't we don't want you messing with
[20:36] this, you
[20:37] know, and everybody's got their own
[20:40] little ideas about, you know, how how
[20:42] everything's going to be. Well, I I
[20:44] don't mess with that now. Well, you know
[20:46] what? If you're going if he's going to
[20:48] be the Lord of your life, then, you
[20:50] know, he's going to have he's going to
[20:50] be in every aspect of your life. the
[20:53] ones that make you the most
[20:54] uncomfortable,
[20:56] the ones that you have the most hidden
[20:58] from everybody. Because the one thing is
[21:00] is you can you can hide so much of your
[21:03] life from from your your parents. You
[21:06] can hide it from your wife. You can hide
[21:08] it from the pastor. You can hide it from
[21:10] so many people. How much of your life is
[21:13] covered by so many things? You can hide
[21:15] so much. But the one thing you can't
[21:17] hide is is who you are before God.
[21:20] You're not going to hide anything from
[21:22] God. God's going to know it all.
[21:25] And you know, because then all of a
[21:26] sudden, God begins to deal with you in
[21:28] the areas where you need help. And lots
[21:30] of times that's where you've got all
[21:31] these defenses set up. Well, I don't
[21:33] want anybody dealing with this. I don't
[21:34] want to deal with Well, you know, that's
[21:35] the problem that you have because you
[21:37] can't grow any further than that. That's
[21:39] where that's where because if you're
[21:41] hiding something, if you've got
[21:43] something fortified because of what took
[21:45] place in your life, what whatever your
[21:48] um you know, brother was talking about
[21:50] the the young man and you know, he had
[21:53] this you know uh you know
[21:58] um inherited traits and you know the
[22:01] different things and you know and you
[22:02] know he couldn't get beyond all of that
[22:04] because that's the way that's what he
[22:06] inherited through through his family and
[22:08] you know they all had this they all had
[22:10] this same attitude the same way and you
[22:12] know he was talking about um somebody in
[22:14] the family his mom or somebody you know
[22:16] said you know you just go down the
[22:17] street and they won't even talk to you
[22:19] and you know they just got this add you
[22:21] know and it's just like you know he's
[22:22] stubborn he's got this spirit on him
[22:24] well he just inherited that well the
[22:26] problem was is that's you know it wasn't
[22:28] as brother Ram said you know that's just
[22:30] life's grabag you get all these
[22:32] different things and you don't get to
[22:33] pick on me but guess what you have to
[22:35] deal with them and God begins to deal
[22:37] with you in these And you have to figure
[22:39] out, you know, are you going to actually
[22:40] allow God to work in your life and
[22:42] deliver you from these things or are you
[22:43] just going to carry them on? Because a
[22:46] lot of times things that happen in our
[22:47] lives. Well, we can't we can't control
[22:49] those things because they come. But
[22:51] guess what we can do? We can't overcome
[22:53] them. We don't have to give s allow
[22:55] Satan to have a towhold in our lives
[22:58] because all of a sudden because these
[23:00] things are these seeds that are sown in
[23:01] our lives that we don't have a control
[23:03] over because of what things happen. But
[23:05] let me tell you what, if you can allow
[23:07] them things, you can root all those
[23:08] things up and get them out of your life.
[23:10] You can because he's here to to relieve
[23:13] you from all those things. You know,
[23:15] there's people that that have, you know,
[23:17] because they they've had they've dealt
[23:18] with abuse and a lot of different things
[23:20] in their life growing up because of the
[23:22] hardships that they had to go through.
[23:24] You know, just like brother Bram talking
[23:25] about having having anger issues and and
[23:28] all that and out there trying to tell
[23:29] him, "Well, just breathe and and tie the
[23:32] little knots in the rope.
[23:36] He was so mad he couldn't even his
[23:38] fingers wouldn't work. You know, he's up
[23:39] there trying to tie knots. You
[23:41] know, was it like two or three of them
[23:43] things? That thing is gone. He's
[23:48] why? Because you know, you're not going
[23:49] to have some kind of psychology thing.
[23:52] You know, mind over matter.
[23:56] Well, if you don't mind, it don't
[23:58] matter. Well, guess what? It does
[24:01] because there's somewhere down on the
[24:03] inside of you because that old man, that
[24:05] old nature is still there. And you know
[24:07] what? And the devil knows where that
[24:09] punch is coming. And he gets right
[24:10] inside where you where you actually
[24:12] live. And you think, well, I'm okay with
[24:14] this. I'm okay with But you know what?
[24:16] The devil will be sitting there going
[24:20] on your one nerve
[24:26] going and everybody's like, "Well, I'm
[24:29] okay." No, the devil knows how to
[24:37] and lots of times it's your family.
[24:40] He knows he knows he knows how to work.
[24:43] He been deal dealing with humans for a
[24:45] long time. That's right.
[24:47] It's it's exact. He knows exactly how to
[24:50] what what what makes you tick and
[24:52] everything about you. And he knows how
[24:53] to get in there and you know and your
[24:56] children that I mean and your spouse,
[25:00] your wife, your husband, I mean they're
[25:02] they're a master at at getting on your
[25:04] bad side and you are a master at getting
[25:08] on your on your wife or husband's
[25:11] nerves.
[25:14] Well, y'all can say amen if you want to.
[25:16] It's the truth. Oh,
[25:20] me. But I know we don't we don't think
[25:23] about that, but it's
[25:26] true. You know, that's like that's like
[25:29] I go to work and you know, thank God one
[25:31] of these days there won't be any
[25:34] jobs. We'll be free of that. Thank the
[25:37] Lord we don't have to get up go to
[25:40] work because you know and it's like the
[25:44] the Lord will send you people because
[25:46] you know the Lord knows what you need
[25:50] and he he knows you need
[25:52] patience and temperance and godliness
[25:56] and he he sends you co-workers that you
[25:59] spend more hours sometimes more hours in
[26:01] a day with them than you do at
[26:05] home.
[26:07] Excuse me. And they
[26:10] uh like I I you know I have to hold on
[26:14] to the scripture sometimes. You know,
[26:16] all things work together for the
[26:18] good. All things work together for good.
[26:21] I don't know what the good is. I don't
[26:24] see the good, but I know that's what the
[26:26] scripture says.
[26:28] You have co-workers and they and they
[26:30] just h
[26:35] You know, they he said he said he
[26:37] wouldn't he wouldn't put more on you
[26:38] than you could bear, but he'd make a way
[26:39] of escape.
[26:41] Well, you know, I think the Lord I was
[26:43] like, I have to go on the roof sometimes
[26:44] and I I I need y'all to stay here. I'm
[26:47] going there.
[26:51] I understand like Moses like y'all stay
[26:53] here. I'm going up on the mountain. I'm
[26:54] going on the mountain. Talk to the Lord.
[26:56] Y'all stay down
[26:58] here. You know, we got to go someplace
[27:00] else. You know, we got to find that that
[27:02] brook cherth like Elijah did. Go down
[27:04] there and stay and let the ravens feed
[27:06] you. You got to find a place to get away
[27:09] sometimes because things things might go
[27:11] south on you.
[27:13] But you know, God sends all these things
[27:15] and you wonder why you have to go
[27:16] through these things, but it's working
[27:17] for your good. All these things happen
[27:21] and and he knows. See, Satan knows what
[27:23] what how to how to reach you, how to get
[27:25] to you, get on your nerves, and you your
[27:28] last nerve will be shot. And then you
[27:30] know something else will happen and and
[27:32] you like I don't know how I'm going to
[27:33] make it.
[27:36] But you know the thing is is the Lord
[27:38] wants you to realize hey you got to
[27:40] trust in me.
[27:43] You know so many times we we face so
[27:45] many trials and and and situations and
[27:48] you know what after a while if you
[27:50] commit it to the Lord then after a while
[27:52] you you come to find out you know what
[27:54] that doesn't bother you as much as it
[27:57] did before.
[27:59] The Lord will bring you through that all
[28:00] of a sudden you you know because you
[28:02] begin to see things and and many times
[28:06] when when we go through situations in
[28:08] our lives when things happen we begin to
[28:11] deal with these things and then all of a
[28:12] sudden you know God begins to show you
[28:14] that person because you know that's one
[28:17] thing brother Ram was talking about in
[28:18] the statue of a perfect man you begin to
[28:20] see how your brother deals with these
[28:21] things you understand where he's coming
[28:23] from and you begin to see these people
[28:25] and you know sometimes it's you have to
[28:27] step back because you see somebody and
[28:29] they're coming at you or or different
[28:32] things happening, but you know, you have
[28:33] to realize, you know, how would how
[28:35] would Jesus handle this, you know, how
[28:37] how can you express Christ to this
[28:40] person, you know, because you know, then
[28:42] you'll begin to see, hey, you know what?
[28:44] I I need I need to see how how God would
[28:47] handle this sit. Well, Lord, what what
[28:49] do I need to do? And sometimes, you
[28:51] know, they they're looking for because
[28:53] they're coming at
[28:54] you mean evil way. But you know what?
[28:57] You don't return evil for evil, but you
[29:00] return good for evil.
[29:04] Because you know what? The world is
[29:05] looking for Jesus Christ. There's a lot
[29:08] of professors out there. There's a lot
[29:10] of people that talk about it. But the
[29:12] problem is is the world is looking for
[29:14] the manifestation of it. They're looking
[29:16] to see Jesus Christ. Can you show Jesus
[29:20] Christ? Do when the world looks at you,
[29:22] do they see Jesus Christ?
[29:26] Because there's a lot of people, you
[29:27] know, uh I was talking to a man the
[29:30] other day and you know, you quote
[29:33] certain just simple things out of the
[29:35] scripture and they look at you like,
[29:37] "What?" It's like, "Well, do you know
[29:39] John
[29:40] 3:16?" That's about that's about about
[29:42] their extent of the
[29:45] Bible. I I asked one of them the other
[29:47] day. We we were talking. I was like,
[29:49] "What's what's I mean, tell me what
[29:50] Genesis 1:1
[29:52] is. Do you know what Genesis
[29:55] 1:1?" And he was like, "Is that in the
[29:58] beginning was the
[30:00] word?" No, that's the beginning of one
[30:03] of the
[30:05] books. And you're getting there. It's in
[30:07] the beginning. That's right.
[30:09] In the beginning,
[30:12] God and he was like created. Oh, the
[30:17] heaven and
[30:20] earth. Well, how how in the world do you
[30:22] plan on getting closer to God and know
[30:24] anything about God if you don't do you
[30:27] believe do you believe this this is the
[30:28] word of God?
[30:30] Do you believe this is the word of God?
[30:33] Do you believe this is inspired of God?
[30:35] Do you believe this came from God and it
[30:38] came to you?
[30:41] Well, then here's an here's an idea. If
[30:42] you want to know more about God, you
[30:45] can't find it on Tik Tok. You can't find
[30:47] it on YouTube.
[30:50] Now, you can find a lot of other stuff
[30:51] on
[30:52] there and you can't you can't find it
[30:55] watching movies. There's a because you
[30:58] know what? when you sit around, you're
[30:59] watching
[31:00] uh hunting videos and and you're
[31:03] watching all this other stuff and they
[31:05] can tell you more about what what uh NFL
[31:09] players are doing what and when and and
[31:11] knowing, you know, more about what the
[31:12] Atlanta Braves are doing and all kinds
[31:14] of stuff like that, which I mean, if you
[31:16] want to watch, that's that's fine. But
[31:18] the problem is is you can't get close to
[31:20] God knowing what the what the batting
[31:22] average of all the Atlanta Brave players
[31:24] are. If you're if you're spending all
[31:26] your time, all you can talk about is the
[31:28] Georgia Bulldogs. The Georgia Bulldogs.
[31:30] Well, you know what? You can't find God
[31:31] on on the Georgia because he's not on
[31:34] the roster. And I'm just going to tell
[31:36] you right now, I'm sorry. I know it's
[31:38] going to break some of y'all's hearts,
[31:39] but he's not on the roster.
[31:44] But the problem is, if you there's one
[31:46] place that you're going to find God and
[31:48] not just coming to church and sitting on
[31:49] a pew and looking at the walls, it going
[31:51] to get you closer to God. That's right.
[31:53] But there's one thing he sent. He sent
[31:55] He said he sent his word. He sent his
[31:58] word to him. And if you want to know
[31:59] what where God's at, God's in his word.
[32:01] And if you don't ever get in the word,
[32:02] then how you ever going to change? How
[32:04] are you going to know God? Because you
[32:05] can't just look at and have some
[32:07] preacher tell you what the what the
[32:09] Bible says. Well, just come pay your
[32:11] tithe and get baptized and you think
[32:13] that's the end of it.
[32:18] That's no relationship with God
[32:21] when you don't even know what the Bible
[32:23] says. But you know the world well you
[32:25] just come church and you we just we just
[32:27] love the
[32:28] Lord and you don't even know don't even
[32:30] know the first thing about God.
[32:34] And it's like well how do you how are
[32:35] you going to know? Well you know what I
[32:37] well I tried to read the Bible and you
[32:39] know what it's it's just too
[32:42] hard. Well, you know what? Here, you
[32:44] just keep reading. And I'll give you
[32:46] another I'll give you another tip. You
[32:48] begin to read the Bible and then you
[32:50] pray. That's right. And you know what?
[32:53] And and don't and don't just just give
[32:55] me, you know, just some kind of quick
[32:58] now lay me down to sleep kind of prayer.
[33:00] But you need to go in there and meditate
[33:01] on what it says and and think about what
[33:04] it says and pray to God so that God
[33:06] begins to speak to you. Because all of a
[33:09] sudden when somebody starts talking
[33:10] about something then if you don't
[33:12] understand God will send somebody along
[33:14] your path and they'll come across your
[33:16] path and begin to speak on things
[33:18] because you know I was I was speaking to
[33:20] this man and all of a sudden he was like
[33:22] that's in the
[33:23] Bible. Yeah. It's amazing what you find
[33:26] if you read the
[33:29] Bible because you know I mean you can
[33:32] spend your time reading all these novels
[33:35] and and all kinds of stuff and you know
[33:37] you know pe people dug way down in the
[33:40] ground and they they've dug everything
[33:41] up and you know they're trying to tell
[33:43] us about aliens and and all kinds of
[33:45] stuff and you know all the things that
[33:49] the the government's doing
[33:51] and you know people they spend they
[33:54] spend their entire lives times wrapped
[33:56] up in conspiracy
[33:59] theories and what what what the
[34:02] government's trying to hide from us and
[34:04] all this thing and all and all the crazy
[34:06] things that's went on and you know
[34:07] what's what what's going on at Area 51
[34:10] and and all these type things and it's
[34:12] like listen guess what I'm going to tell
[34:13] you something you know what because and
[34:16] and I may be getting off my subject but
[34:18] I'm just trying to I'm just trying to
[34:19] lay a foundation here but when you see
[34:21] these things you know what all this
[34:22] stuff is going away Yes. All of all of
[34:25] this is going to pass away. The only
[34:27] thing that's coming is because he said
[34:29] he's coming back. And guess what? You're
[34:32] either going to go with him or you're
[34:33] going to have to go face a white throne
[34:34] judgment. There is a day coming when
[34:37] you're not going to live any longer. And
[34:39] all the things that you see, your bank
[34:41] account won't be around anymore.
[34:44] Your 40k won't 401k won't matter to you.
[34:47] It won't mean a thing to you. You can't
[34:50] do anything with it. But there's one
[34:52] thing that's going to you're going to
[34:54] have to take this word and you're going
[34:55] to have to give an account for it
[34:58] because God sent his word and somebody's
[35:00] crossed your path and told you, you know
[35:01] what, you need to repent and somebody's
[35:03] told you you need to read the word of
[35:04] God. Well, you know what? Then you've
[35:05] got to do something with that because
[35:07] you have Jesus on your hands. Yes, sir.
[35:13] And so you see that because that is that
[35:16] is our our commission to go into the
[35:19] world and preach the gospel to minister
[35:22] to those and tell these people, you know
[35:23] what, there is a way out because it's
[35:25] not going to last very long.
[35:29] This this earth will not stand the way
[35:31] it is right now. There is a day coming
[35:33] and it's going to be all over with. Yes,
[35:36] sir. I tell people, listen, there is a
[35:39] an elect bride. There's an elect body of
[35:42] Jesus Christ. And one of these days,
[35:43] he's coming to take his own out of here.
[35:45] And you better be ready to go. You
[35:47] better know that you know that you know
[35:48] that you're ready to get out of here.
[35:50] And let me tell you, when when the when
[35:52] the bride is gone, there's a wrath being
[35:54] poured out that that your mind can't
[35:56] comprehend what's going to take place.
[35:59] And you tell these people, listen, you
[36:01] got to get
[36:02] ready. You better know there because you
[36:05] know what? There ain't there ain't a
[36:07] second arc coming.
[36:11] There is a one there's one way out and
[36:13] that's Jesus Christ. And after that
[36:14] you're going to have to give an account.
[36:18] God don't have no second way
[36:22] out. No
[36:24] uh left behind strategy.
[36:29] There's one way out and that's through
[36:30] Jesus Christ.
[36:33] You can't you can't come up with it is
[36:36] you better you better know that you have
[36:38] received that token that life that that
[36:41] that
[36:42] forgiveness through Jesus Christ and you
[36:44] better know that your sins are forgiven
[36:47] and that you are under the blood
[36:52] because the other any other
[36:54] way is not going to work.
[37:00] Brother Ram says here they said the
[37:02] devil has a pattern of everything God
[37:04] has
[37:05] real. Bab the Babylon was made a pattern
[37:08] of heaven all the natural. See just
[37:10] exactly there is a real genuine
[37:12] Christian filled with the Holy Ghost.
[37:14] There is a lot of hypocrites that just
[37:17] act like it. He said the hypocrite only
[37:20] declares that the real person to stand
[37:22] out bright and shiny, doesn't it? All
[37:24] the false and bogus things only declare
[37:26] the real. See, most everybody, you know,
[37:29] they're they're looking for something
[37:31] that's real. Well, you know what?
[37:32] Because everybody because when you start
[37:34] to see these things, and I was speaking
[37:36] to the young people, too. When you see
[37:38] the things in the world, Satan has has
[37:40] so many things out in front of you to
[37:41] show you all these things, the first
[37:43] thing he wants to do is show you the
[37:46] bogus. But you know what? If there's if
[37:48] there is a counterfeit dollar bill, then
[37:50] you know what? There's a genuine
[37:51] somewhere. He said, "As long as there's
[37:53] a counterfeit, there's a real one." Is
[37:55] that right? As long as you can see an
[37:57] act of the devil, just remember he's
[37:59] impersonating something of God, a real
[38:01] one somewhere. See, that's right. Just
[38:04] remember when you see that, that's what
[38:06] it is.
[38:08] So, we have to see that we have to have
[38:11] this to be the example. But you see
[38:13] these things that God is showing us
[38:16] these things. And the devil's going to
[38:18] have his pattern. He's going to have his
[38:19] way to come. And you're you're going to
[38:21] have to see that the devil's going to
[38:23] come against you with everything that he
[38:24] has. But you got to understand God has
[38:27] brought the word to you. And you you go
[38:30] out there and you tell people, listen,
[38:31] you got to be ready to go.
[38:38] And you know, you don't have to try to
[38:39] it's like you you tell people, you don't
[38:41] have to try to explain everything to
[38:42] them. You don't got to tell the whole
[38:43] Bible to them.
[38:45] But the one thing is you got to you got
[38:47] to repent.
[38:49] You got you got to accept Jesus Christ
[38:50] as your savior. You got to realize that
[38:52] you're lost and there ain't no other way
[38:54] to make it. And you go out there and you
[38:56] tell people, you know what, because when
[38:58] when you read the scripture and it says
[39:00] to be baptized in the name of the
[39:02] father, son, the holy ghost, tell me
[39:04] what the name is.
[39:07] You go and ask somebody, what's what's
[39:08] your name?
[39:16] It don't take it ain't rocket science.
[39:19] You ask somebody what what's your name?
[39:21] They tell you what their name is. Well,
[39:22] you know what? What's the what's the
[39:23] name in the Bible?
[39:26] What's what's the what's the one name
[39:28] that's given under heaven?
[39:31] What what what everything that we do in
[39:32] word or deed is only to be done in one
[39:34] name.
[39:36] When Jesus told them to baptize in the
[39:38] name of the father, son, the holy ghost,
[39:40] then on the day of Pentecost when the
[39:41] holy ghost fell and quicken the word to
[39:43] them and they went out to preach the
[39:45] gospel, proclaim the gospel to the
[39:47] world, what did ge what did Peter say
[39:50] that that went out there? What did Peter
[39:51] and the 11 when they walked out there
[39:52] and began to proclaim the scripture.
[39:54] What did they do? They baptized in the
[39:56] name of Jesus Christ. There's only one
[39:58] name that you can be saved in is in
[40:00] Jesus Christ. Only one you can be
[40:02] baptized in is Jesus Christ. But
[40:04] whatever you're asking for, there's only
[40:05] one name that has deliverance in it, and
[40:07] that's the name of Jesus Christ. And
[40:09] that's the only thing that we have is
[40:11] the name of Jesus Christ. And that's the
[40:12] name we ought to be called of.
[40:16] We should be called business Jesus
[40:17] Christ.
[40:20] You don't have to tell the whole world,
[40:22] but you know, there's people that go out
[40:23] there and they can't see that. And some
[40:25] people, some people, they begin to see
[40:27] that and they realize it. And you know
[40:29] what? They allow the devil to steal that
[40:30] away from them.
[40:32] They hold on to that. But you know what?
[40:34] They never go any further than that.
[40:37] Why? Because they, well, you know what?
[40:39] Uncle Bob says such and such and and
[40:42] granny said this and so and so said that
[40:44] and the preacher said this and you know
[40:46] and everybody else says this and that
[40:48] and you know, but what does the Bible
[40:50] say? What does the Bible say? Then take
[40:53] it right back to the scripture. Then
[40:54] that's where you stand. That's exactly
[40:56] where you got to put your foundation.
[40:57] What does what does the word when God
[40:59] begins to deal with your heart? What
[41:01] does he tell you?
[41:04] You got to deal with it. You got to
[41:06] answer for that.
[41:09] See, it's a See, the same Holy Ghost
[41:11] that fell on the day of Pentecost is the
[41:13] same Holy Ghost that is today.
[41:17] He said, Brother Ram says, "I admit it's
[41:18] been on tramped on, made fun of,
[41:21] misinterpreted, misrepresented, and
[41:23] everything else like that." That's only
[41:25] the that's only the devil counterfeiting
[41:28] counterfeiting. But there is a real
[41:30] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[41:32] brings the same results that it did on
[41:34] the day of Pentecost. That's
[41:37] right. Yeah. Everybody wants to run it
[41:40] all down and discount what was said, but
[41:42] you know, it's still the same. And if
[41:44] you put your trust and and have an open
[41:46] mind and pray to God that he begins to
[41:48] deal with you, then then you can see
[41:50] that God's going to lead you right down
[41:51] what the scripture says.
[41:55] See, the thing is is, you know, I I know
[42:00] where I stand and I and you've got to
[42:02] have the same experience. You got to
[42:04] know what the scripture says and know
[42:05] where you're standing and what the truth
[42:07] is for your day.
[42:10] You know, because you know, it does it
[42:11] doesn't matter how many people try to
[42:12] tell me that this message is wrong or
[42:15] you know, brother Brandham was wrong, he
[42:17] was fake, he was a false prophet,
[42:18] whatever. It doesn't matter how much
[42:20] they try to tell me all those things.
[42:21] You know what? It still doesn't change
[42:23] the fact that I still believe it. And if
[42:25] I, you know, because if if I'm lost and
[42:27] eternally lost because of that, then
[42:29] guess what? That's where I've sealed
[42:30] I've put my faith and that's where I'm
[42:33] sealed at. And I'm not moving from that
[42:35] because that's what God has put me to.
[42:37] But you know what? I began to see
[42:38] through the scripture, the opening of
[42:40] the word to see the day and hour which
[42:42] we live because everybody says, "Well, I
[42:44] don't see this and I don't see that."
[42:46] Well, I'm sorry because the more I look
[42:47] into the scripture, the more I can see
[42:49] the types and the shadows match up
[42:51] perfectly exactly with the ministry of
[42:54] brother Brandham and the day and hour in
[42:55] which we live.
[43:01] See, I I it just it just it just show I
[43:04] see I just see it. Amen. I mean I I I
[43:07] can I can see the day and hour which we
[43:09] live. can see the the the
[43:11] the you look at the the the government
[43:15] the the everything that's going on all
[43:17] around the world
[43:19] and brother Brandham stand there and he
[43:21] prophesying and telling us what was
[43:23] going to take place and we began to see
[43:25] those things exactly as brother Brandham
[43:27] told us they coming to pass today sir
[43:32] I don't know I don't know about you it
[43:33] doesn't shake my faith it encourages me
[43:36] it it it lifts me up it strengthens me
[43:43] say brother Ram
[43:44] said he was speaking of the young people
[43:48] talking about the day and and the hour
[43:50] and he said see talking about the young
[43:51] the young people he said do you realize
[43:53] the things that you're doing he said if
[43:55] there is another generation your
[43:57] children will be but judged for what you
[43:59] do he said haven't you got any respect
[44:02] or
[44:04] decency see they're out wearing all
[44:06] kinds of immoral stuff and everything
[44:07] like that he said God said he'd visit
[44:09] the iniquity of the parents upon the
[44:12] children and their children to three and
[44:15] four
[44:16] generations. Now, he was talking about
[44:18] the condition that the world is in from
[44:20] that time to this day to see the
[44:22] condition that the families have been in
[44:25] and why we need to hold up the standard
[44:26] because we've seen it how it's just
[44:28] declined and declined and declined and
[44:30] declined. But let me tell you what, the
[44:31] standard, the word of God didn't change.
[44:33] The standard of God didn't change. The
[44:35] standard is still the same. But he
[44:37] brother continues on. He said, "But did
[44:39] you realize, my brother, every time you
[44:41] do that which is right, that'll be
[44:44] visited upon your children."
[44:48] And he continues on here and he says,
[44:50] "See, and Levi, who received tithe, paid
[44:53] tithe, for he was yet in the loins of
[44:55] Abraham when he met Melzdc, and Abraham
[44:58] was his great-grandfather. And Levi was
[45:00] in the loins of Abraham." The Bible said
[45:02] he paid tithe to Melzdc. He said, '
[45:05] Don't let nobody tell you that any kind
[45:08] of move in the world can ever interfere
[45:10] with God's great cog. She's moving right
[45:13] on. He said, "It was planned back there
[45:15] in the beginning, there ain't ain't a
[45:18] devils or enough devils that can
[45:20] interfere with his program." So, let me
[45:22] tell you something. When God sent you to
[45:25] uphold the standard, let me tell you
[45:26] something. the blessings will be upon
[45:28] your family because you uphold the
[45:30] standards because of what you walk the
[45:32] what the the word says do you do that
[45:35] and as you go through that you know what
[45:37] then the blessings will be upon your
[45:38] family if you want the if you want the
[45:40] blessings of God then you know what then
[45:41] you follow what the word has to say
[45:45] and the thing is when you when you begin
[45:47] to follow what the word says when you
[45:49] begin to do the things that the word
[45:50] says then what it say there ain't enough
[45:52] devils in hell that's going to stop the
[45:54] plan of God there's not enough devils in
[45:57] hell that can stop what God is doing.
[45:59] What God is doing in your life, no
[46:01] matter how much it looks bad, no matter
[46:03] how much things it looks like it's not
[46:05] going to happen. Let me tell you
[46:06] something. If you follow what God says,
[46:09] if you put your trust in God, then you
[46:11] know what? It's going to come to pass.
[46:15] Because if you don't put your trust,
[46:17] how's it ever going to come to pass?
[46:20] You know, because you know, like brother
[46:21] said, you know, if you if you knew that
[46:23] you were going to be shot in the
[46:24] morning, you know, you know, you got are
[46:26] you going to fear? Are you going to have
[46:27] faith?
[46:32] He said, well, you know, if we fear
[46:34] nothing's going to change, but you know,
[46:35] if I have faith, there's something I
[46:37] change.
[46:38] But if the word says that that there
[46:40] will if we follow according to the
[46:42] scripture, then you know what? It
[46:44] changes things. Amen. There is a way of
[46:46] deliverance and it'll come out the way
[46:48] because if he promised it, if it's in
[46:50] the scripture and and it is promised to
[46:52] us, then if we are children and heirs of
[46:54] God, then you know what? Then it's ours
[46:56] to claim it.
[47:01] And no matter if we have the bigger the
[47:03] the bigger the the test, the bigger the
[47:05] problem, the bigger the trial, then the
[47:07] greater the testimony, the greater the
[47:09] blessing that's going to come.
[47:12] You know, that's the reason I I really
[47:13] enjoy when brother Ryan was speaking,
[47:16] you know, going going through all the
[47:18] things that they they went through, him
[47:19] and Sister Gabby went through and you
[47:21] know, when when the de when the doctors
[47:23] are telling you, you know, when the
[47:25] devil's playing in your mind and the
[47:26] doctor's telling you you can't make it,
[47:27] your daughter can't make it, all these
[47:29] things, all they can see, all of the you
[47:30] know what you look at the promises of
[47:32] God and let me tell you something. If if
[47:34] he if he made it, if he done it one time
[47:36] for one person, then you know what? you
[47:38] meet on the same ground with the same
[47:40] faith and he'll do it again.
[47:47] Some, you know, you think about, well,
[47:49] you know, you you think about some
[47:52] illiterate woman down there in
[47:55] Memphis that didn't have anything. But
[47:58] you know what? She had faith in what God
[48:00] said. She had an experience with God to
[48:02] have her an her faith anchored in the
[48:04] word of God. And standing there
[48:08] She might have never had nothing in her
[48:09] life. She might have never mounted
[48:11] anything. But you know what? She had
[48:12] faith in God that she could ground a
[48:15] plane. When she found out who she was
[48:17] and she had faith and she could claim
[48:19] what God had given her, then you know
[48:21] what? She could ground that plane. And
[48:23] she said, "I'm the Shinomite woman."
[48:25] Said, "But where's your Elijah?"
[48:30] When she got down on her knees, you know
[48:31] what? She got desperate with God cuz she
[48:33] got an answer. And the problem is is
[48:36] many times in our lives, the problem is
[48:38] the reason we don't have a breakthrough
[48:39] is we give up too easy because we've
[48:41] allowed the devil to sway us one way or
[48:43] the other because we've allowed doubt
[48:45] and and dismay and all these other
[48:47] things get in our way. But you know
[48:48] what? You stay right there and hold on
[48:50] because just like that woman, she held
[48:53] on. She was out there and standing there
[48:56] praying all night till she got an answer
[48:58] from God.
[49:00] She didn't know what was going to take
[49:01] place. She didn't know what was going to
[49:02] take place. But you know what? She knew
[49:04] God had given her an answer. And she saw
[49:06] that dream that brother Brandham was
[49:08] coming down her way.
[49:11] Here's here's brother Brandham. He
[49:12] didn't even know what was going to take
[49:13] place. He didn't know what was going to
[49:14] take. What? What? Why? Why? God, Lord,
[49:17] I'm just following you. I don't know why
[49:18] I'm out this way.
[49:21] He just going along. I'm just following
[49:23] the leading of the Lord. The Holy
[49:25] Spirit's leading me down this road.
[49:27] Walking miles. He said, "Well, I guess I
[49:30] don't know when I'm going to get home.
[49:33] plane's probably already gone by
[49:36] now. But you know what? He he wasn't
[49:38] worried about what's going to happen
[49:43] next. See, people say, "Well, you know,
[49:46] I I would I would like to be led of the
[49:48] Lord, but you know what? I I I would I
[49:51] would I would like the leading of the
[49:53] Lord and and and to be able to do
[49:54] things." And it's like, well, you know,
[49:56] I don't have the finances for this and I
[49:57] don't have the education for this and I
[49:59] don't have the time to do this and I
[50:01] don't have this and this is a problem
[50:03] and that's a
[50:05] problem. But you know what, John? Just
[50:07] like brother Brandon out there, you
[50:08] know, just walking along. I'm one of
[50:10] them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that
[50:14] I can say I'm one of them. Well, I'm
[50:16] being led by the spirit. Amen. I'm not
[50:19] I'm not trying to answer trying to
[50:20] figure out all the questions. All I know
[50:22] is I'm being led of the spirit.
[50:25] just give all that over to the Lord and
[50:27] say, "Lord, I don't know. I'm just going
[50:28] to keep
[50:29] walking. I'm just going to keep walking
[50:32] and I don't know where I'm going." All
[50:33] of a sudden, he passed by this black
[50:35] lady standing out there by the fence wet
[50:37] from the dew because you'd been out
[50:38] there all night.
[50:41] And she's standing there and saying,
[50:42] "Good morning,
[50:45] Parson." And he's like, "Good morning,
[50:47] auntie." And just keep and then like,
[50:48] "How'd you know I was a parson? I've
[50:50] been waiting on you.
[50:53] See, her faith moved a plane, moved the
[50:57] prophet. Brother Brandon didn't, you
[50:59] know, God didn't tell Brother Brandon
[51:00] what was going on. Hey, listen. You go
[51:03] 20 miles this way. And when you get down
[51:05] there where the big oak tree is and just
[51:07] look over to the left, there's a black
[51:09] lady standing there with a man's shirt
[51:11] tied on her head standing by the fence.
[51:13] She's got a son that's
[51:17] dying. He didn't know nothing.
[51:22] But you know what? He walked by faith.
[51:25] He knew the leading of the
[51:27] Lord. And so many times we, you know,
[51:30] because when the when the the Lord wants
[51:32] to use us, many times we we get up here,
[51:36] you know what? It's it's going to be an
[51:38] utter failure, brother. We It ain't
[51:40] going it ain't going to matter to
[51:41] Hillbeans. It ain't going it ain't going
[51:43] to touch nobody. No, nobody's going to
[51:45] get blessed by this. And you know and
[51:46] it's you know what and sometimes when we
[51:49] spend our our time you know talking the
[51:51] devil's language and you know and don't
[51:53] realize not realizing you know what if
[51:54] we just get sold out to God can use us
[52:00] you know I don't I don't you know I
[52:01] don't I don't I don't expect to travel
[52:03] the world and do things but you know
[52:04] what I believe that I if I can touch one
[52:06] person then you know what that and all
[52:10] the rest of it is immaterial. It doesn't
[52:12] it doesn't matter if I can just reach
[52:13] one soul. If there's one that that I
[52:15] that can account to my to my life to my
[52:19] if I've touched one person, if I
[52:20] encourage one person, you know, then it
[52:22] makes it all worthwhile.
[52:26] You know, because you know what? God
[52:27] God's not going to ask us how much we
[52:29] done and how much money we raised and
[52:31] all these kind of things. Hey, all he's
[52:32] going to ask us is one question. Are you
[52:34] faithful? Have you were you faithful to
[52:36] the calling that God give you? Or have
[52:38] you been faithful to what God give you?
[52:43] are you faithful?
[52:47] It's not how big it is or how little
[52:53] is. I don't care if anybody ever knows
[52:56] my name or anything like
[52:58] that, but I want I want to be faithful
[53:01] to the call of God. I want I want to do
[53:04] everything that I can. whether it's
[53:06] like, well, I don't know how this is
[53:07] going to work out, how that's going to
[53:08] work out. God takes care of all that.
[53:13] Here's this little black lady down there
[53:16] in
[53:19] Memphis. But she got her answer.
[53:24] Here's brother Brad. He didn't know
[53:25] where he was going or what was going to
[53:26] take place. But you know what? God used
[53:28] him.
[53:31] Now, he could he could have been
[53:32] standing behind some pull pit calling
[53:34] people out. He could have had a prayer
[53:35] line of thousands of
[53:37] people. But you know what? There was one
[53:40] that cried
[53:42] out that had a desperate
[53:45] call that she she reached God by her
[53:49] faith. And you
[53:51] know, the prophet came to her house
[53:56] and was well with God all things are
[53:59] possible.
[54:02] Well, you
[54:04] know, see, we try to limit
[54:07] God. The devil wants Well, you know, he
[54:10] might do it for somebody else, but I
[54:12] don't know about you.
[54:18] See, if he said whosoever
[54:22] will, if if it's un if it's to the least
[54:25] of in the kingdom, if all the blessings
[54:28] of God, if all the promises of God are
[54:31] to the least in the kingdom, then guess
[54:33] what? If you're in the kingdom, they're
[54:35] yours.
[54:36] Then you then they belong to you.
[54:39] Then you claim what God gave
[54:46] you. See, We see that how the the world
[54:50] has gotten into this condition. Brother
[54:52] Ram is talking about the he says the
[54:54] churches see you just can't go to some
[54:57] church and and follow some kind of
[54:59] program or or anything like that. You
[55:01] got to know Christ for yourself. You got
[55:02] to have an experience for yourself.
[55:05] This is from the message of baptism of
[55:07] the Holy Spirit. Brother speaking and he
[55:08] was talking about the churches. He said
[55:10] he said see the churches have adopted
[55:12] this program. He was listening to some
[55:14] program on the radio. He said, "We're
[55:16] the program of teaching their children
[55:18] modern
[55:19] drinking." He said, "What kind of bunch
[55:21] of idiots are you going to
[55:24] produce?" He said, "Why is it?" Because
[55:28] their mammy and papy at home knows no
[55:30] more about God than a hot and does about
[55:32] an Egyptian knight. Abstain from the
[55:35] whole thing.
[55:38] See, and everybody goes to churches and
[55:40] you know and and it's it's the most
[55:43] ridiculous
[55:45] mess and but you know that that that's
[55:47] the whole thing. Just go to church. Our
[55:50] church does this and our church does
[55:52] that. And you know what I've I've seen
[55:54] I've seen I mean the light shows and the
[55:58] music. I mean when I went to a rock
[56:00] concert that's what that was. that
[56:04] I mean sometimes they go to church and
[56:06] they and the music gets so cranked up
[56:08] it's like do they pass out
[56:13] earplugs and well we're worshiping the
[56:17] Lord. How do you know? You know people
[56:20] I've seen people go and and they they
[56:21] start listening to this music and man
[56:23] they don't have they have no idea what
[56:25] the words
[56:27] are. I was listening to this group one
[56:30] time and these people and this dude
[56:31] jumped up.
[56:34] Yeah. Man, he got he got all in this
[56:36] music. Yeah. And then later on realized
[56:39] it was a Christian song. He's like,
[56:44] "Oh, why?" Because the music is rock
[56:47] music.
[56:49] And what was the spirit behind it?
[56:52] It's the same spirit that was inside of
[56:54] him that was that stirred him up. is the
[56:57] same spirit that he was feeding on.
[56:59] That's right.
[57:02] It's the exact same thing. And he was
[57:03] out there enjoying himself till he found
[57:05] out, oh, it's talking about
[57:11] God. Well, you
[57:13] know, you let the let the devil into
[57:16] church and you know, it's just some kind
[57:18] of free-for-all and everybody think,
[57:21] well, you know, this is this is this is
[57:22] this is how we worship God.
[57:27] God God's not in in that
[57:31] because you know what it's like when you
[57:33] because you know you you go to church
[57:35] and you and you lay aside the scripture,
[57:37] you lay aside the
[57:39] Bible and you you know we just we just
[57:42] we just think good thoughts and we just
[57:44] love the Lord and we just come here and
[57:47] we can we can sing and raise our
[57:50] hands and when you begin to talk about
[57:53] living a Christian
[57:55] life. What's what's a Christian life?
[57:58] It's the same kind of life that God
[58:00] lived, that Jesus Christ lived.
[58:04] See, when you come to church and he,
[58:07] brother, I'm talking about having have
[58:09] an experience with God. He said, you
[58:10] know, people come to church, he said
[58:12] their whole they're so
[58:13] hard-hearted. He said they don't shed a
[58:15] tear. He said the spirit, he said
[58:17] they're just so indifferent. He said
[58:19] it's the spirit of the age that they
[58:21] live in.
[58:23] So what is it? Men's hearts failing,
[58:25] perplexed of times. He said, "Natural
[58:28] effects gone from people. Natural
[58:30] affections gone from people." He said,
[58:32] "The love of God seems to pull
[58:35] away." And everybody's like, "Well, you
[58:37] know, we just we just come to church and
[58:39] but you know, there there's no there's
[58:40] no love of of
[58:43] God. There there's there's no movement.
[58:46] They don't they don't have any they well
[58:48] we just come to church and we just we
[58:50] just just go through the motions
[58:53] and you know you see people that that
[58:55] come to church and they just have
[58:57] somebody come up and you know we we talk
[58:59] about some kind of little moral code and
[59:01] you know just you know just just do
[59:03] right and you know you know you know
[59:05] just just help your neighbor and and all
[59:08] these type things and and not realize
[59:10] you know what it takes a death
[59:14] and you it's you dying out to yourself.
[59:18] It's not it's not some kind of
[59:19] psychology where we're just going to
[59:21] change. We're going to change our
[59:24] outlook.
[59:26] No, it's let this mind be in you that
[59:30] was also in Christ
[59:33] Jesus. Where the old man dies in Jesus
[59:36] Christ. It's no longer I that live now,
[59:39] but it's Christ that lives in us.
[59:42] See, we have to get past beyond all of
[59:44] that.
[59:47] See, everybody wants to just see how how
[59:49] things
[59:50] are th this just modern kind of way of
[59:54] living and it's just you know I believe
[59:56] it was uh brother Ernie Villinoeva
[59:59] talking about you know you know you know
[1:00:01] there's you know just these colorless
[1:00:03] dreams and smooth knees and and all
[1:00:06] these type things it's just you know
[1:00:08] just just floating along but you know
[1:00:11] brother Ram talk about you know how do
[1:00:12] you measure a
[1:00:14] hand. Not how big he is, not how strong
[1:00:17] he is. He said, "But but by the re the
[1:00:21] wrinkles in his trousers from being on
[1:00:24] his
[1:00:26] knees." How do you How do you Because
[1:00:28] somebody that spent their time praying
[1:00:31] that have prayed through, that's how you
[1:00:33] can tell somebody that's a
[1:00:36] Christian and you know, and it's just
[1:00:38] like, well, you know, they they they
[1:00:39] want they want the things of the world.
[1:00:41] They want to have they want to have a
[1:00:42] nice
[1:00:43] life. Well, you're not promised a nice
[1:00:46] life
[1:00:49] because you know what? All that all that
[1:00:51] live in Christ are going to suffer
[1:00:53] persecution. All that live godly
[1:00:57] because you know what? He didn't he
[1:00:59] didn't promise us anything on this side
[1:01:00] of the
[1:01:01] earth. He didn't promise us no flowery
[1:01:04] bread of ease. Nothing nothing could go
[1:01:06] right. But you know what? We're laying
[1:01:07] up treasures that are beyond here.
[1:01:11] The scripture tells us all these things
[1:01:13] that we see, they're temporal. But the
[1:01:15] things that we're laying up, the things
[1:01:16] that we don't see, he said they are
[1:01:18] eternal. So there's a certain thing that
[1:01:20] we're coming to that you got to get
[1:01:22] beyond all these things to get to a
[1:01:24] place that that is eternal to know what
[1:01:26] eternal life
[1:01:28] is. We're going to move beyond all these
[1:01:31] things, this realm, because it's all
[1:01:33] going to pass away.
[1:01:37] So, I'm going to go back here in First
[1:01:43] Timothy. He said, ' Let no man despise
[1:01:46] thy youth, but be an example of the
[1:01:50] believer. And the words here before I
[1:01:53] close, I want to just touch on this.
[1:01:58] It
[1:02:00] says in co in word, in conversation, in
[1:02:04] charity, in spirit, in faith, and in
[1:02:09] purity, you begin to look into the
[1:02:11] scripture. I just want to, you know,
[1:02:13] look at a few things tonight because I I
[1:02:16] want you to
[1:02:18] understand that, you know, you you got
[1:02:20] to you got to come to this place and
[1:02:22] know what a believer is. And you got to
[1:02:23] be a
[1:02:24] believer. And you got you got to come to
[1:02:27] this
[1:02:28] place and you know and it and it's us to
[1:02:32] show that example to show Jesus Christ
[1:02:34] to the
[1:02:35] world and it says in
[1:02:38] word you know the the things that we say
[1:02:42] we've got to we've got to have the the
[1:02:44] word and know how to you know because
[1:02:46] you know the scripture tells us that
[1:02:50] life and death is in the power of the
[1:02:53] tongue. the things that we say we can we
[1:02:56] can we can have an effect on people. We
[1:02:59] influence people by the things that we
[1:03:02] say and you know the scripture says that
[1:03:04] that let everything that we say be
[1:03:06] seasoned with
[1:03:09] salt. You know let let no evil
[1:03:12] communication come out of your
[1:03:14] mouth. You know you have to know what
[1:03:17] you're saying and know how to say it.
[1:03:20] And sometimes the best thing is no don't
[1:03:22] say anything at all.
[1:03:24] Sometimes you don't have to apologize
[1:03:26] for the things you don't say.
[1:03:32] Sometimes we get in trouble for and we
[1:03:33] have to apologize because we didn't say
[1:03:35] something because we should have said
[1:03:37] something and we didn't say
[1:03:39] something. when the Lord begins to speak
[1:03:41] to us and tell us we need to do
[1:03:44] things and you see you see the condition
[1:03:46] that the world is in
[1:03:49] today and and and people today they say
[1:03:54] things and and especially with social
[1:03:56] media they get out and they say things
[1:03:59] on social media and they don't think
[1:04:01] there's any consequences to it.
[1:04:07] You know, I was watching a video the
[1:04:08] other day. This man And you know, they
[1:04:10] they they arrested him and brought him
[1:04:12] back to Florida from some other state.
[1:04:15] And you know, he threatened he
[1:04:16] threatened one of the sheriffs in some
[1:04:19] county in Florida and they went up there
[1:04:22] and arrested him, brought him back. As
[1:04:24] soon as he got off the plane, he's in
[1:04:25] handcuffs and the sheriff met him
[1:04:28] there. Said, "Mr. So and so, I'm the
[1:04:30] sheriff of this town. I'm so and so. I'm
[1:04:32] the one that you
[1:04:34] threatened." He said, "We got a place
[1:04:36] for you over here.
[1:04:38] we got you a room over
[1:04:40] here. And the deputies hauled him off to
[1:04:43] jail. And he
[1:04:48] was well, guess what? Your words,
[1:04:51] they'll justify you or they'll condemn
[1:04:54] you.
[1:04:56] You'll you'll have you have to watch
[1:04:58] what you say
[1:05:01] because you know what brother brother
[1:05:02] Ram said even the scripture tells you
[1:05:04] you know we are supposed to say what God
[1:05:07] says to confess what it says to say the
[1:05:10] same thing
[1:05:13] and you
[1:05:15] know when you talk about young people
[1:05:18] because this
[1:05:21] is some of it you know it's geared
[1:05:24] toward the young people. But it it the
[1:05:26] the main part of this is to us the
[1:05:30] adults to
[1:05:33] parents because you know what and and we
[1:05:37] we had an incident some some time back
[1:05:40] but you
[1:05:42] know you know and when I found out about
[1:05:46] it it was it was my son
[1:05:55] And you know, and I and and we we had a
[1:05:57] we had a meeting, brother Wade and the
[1:06:01] other people, and I'm not going to get
[1:06:02] into all that, but we had a meeting. And
[1:06:05] you know what? You you you have to
[1:06:07] realize the things that you say has an
[1:06:09] effect on somebody.
[1:06:11] And one of the biggest things that we
[1:06:13] face in this world today that young
[1:06:14] people face today is bullying.
[1:06:20] You think it's funny because you can say
[1:06:22] something and sometimes you can say
[1:06:24] something on the phone or social media
[1:06:26] or you can just laugh it off because
[1:06:28] somebody else
[1:06:30] laughs. But you know what? When you say
[1:06:32] something like that, it has an effect on
[1:06:36] somebody because you know what? You
[1:06:38] wouldn't want somebody to say that to
[1:06:44] you, you know, and it and it it hurts
[1:06:56] me because, you know, I stop and and and
[1:06:59] look at look at a young girl in this
[1:07:01] church and when when something is said
[1:07:02] and somebody just thinks it's it's
[1:07:05] inconsequential, it did it meant
[1:07:06] something to her, it meant something to
[1:07:13] me. And that's the reason, you know, we
[1:07:16] have to be we have to be mindful of
[1:07:17] these things because the things that we
[1:07:21] say, you're sewing a
[1:07:25] seed. You can't sew a seed and then pray
[1:07:27] for a crop failure.
[1:07:32] the so you sow a seed and brother Ram
[1:07:34] said you sow one little seed and you'll
[1:07:36] reap a wash tub full of
[1:07:42] it that's the reason that one you
[1:07:46] know I appreciate brother Dale for one
[1:07:50] thing well there's many things but
[1:07:52] there's one thing that really stands out
[1:07:53] to me brother Dale said one time he said
[1:07:57] that he said if I done anything to you
[1:08:00] whether I done wrong or not. He said,
[1:08:01] "If you if you tell me I I need to
[1:08:03] apologize to you or you say that I done
[1:08:05] something wrong," he said, "I'll
[1:08:06] apologize to you whether I done it wrong
[1:08:08] or
[1:08:11] not." He said, "You come to me and say
[1:08:13] you such, you know, you offended me or
[1:08:15] whatever." He said, "I'll apologize
[1:08:18] whether I'm in the wrong or not."
[1:08:22] And I, you know, it takes it takes a
[1:08:24] real it takes a real man to do that. It
[1:08:25] takes a real Christian to do that.
[1:08:29] And I you know what and and I and I
[1:08:31] don't mind being the one to stand up
[1:08:33] here and if it and if it's me then you
[1:08:35] know what I'm the one I'm the one that
[1:08:36] handles it and I'll
[1:08:40] apologize. I don't mind calling people
[1:08:43] on the
[1:08:44] phone. I don't mind apologizing to
[1:08:49] people. Because you know what I you
[1:08:51] because I don't want I don't want
[1:08:52] anything to hinder me and I don't want
[1:08:54] anything to hinder you.
[1:08:57] I don't want anything to hinder this
[1:08:58] church
[1:09:01] because you know what you know he said
[1:09:02] he said one little unconfessed sin in
[1:09:05] this church he said can cause this
[1:09:06] church to bitterly fail.
[1:09:09] He said your
[1:09:13] conduct you know it's like well it's not
[1:09:15] just it's not just hindering the next
[1:09:16] service it can hinder the the growth of
[1:09:19] this church.
[1:09:22] And he said, "And you'll answer for
[1:09:26] it." And so that's the reason why I
[1:09:29] don't I don't want just let anything
[1:09:31] slide. I I want I want to be exactly
[1:09:35] what we need to
[1:09:38] be. Uproot all these
[1:09:43] things, you know. So when we look at
[1:09:46] these things in the by our
[1:09:49] words, we also have the scripture tells
[1:09:51] us in Peter, we need to know and give an
[1:09:55] answer when we are asked of the hope
[1:09:58] that lies within us.
[1:10:00] We need to be studied and and to be
[1:10:02] sanctified to know these things and how
[1:10:05] how to give an answer to the things that
[1:10:07] when when we're asked of these things to
[1:10:09] give an answer what what is inside of us
[1:10:12] and the hope and the and the revelation
[1:10:14] that we have to give an answer to
[1:10:16] it because you know what the the world
[1:10:19] is not is
[1:10:20] not everybody's going to accept it. You
[1:10:22] can you can talk till you're blue in the
[1:10:24] face. But you know what? That's not
[1:10:25] going to change
[1:10:28] me. But I do know what this why I
[1:10:31] believe the way I do and what I
[1:10:35] believe. And the scripture says in word
[1:10:38] and in
[1:10:39] conversation. The scripture says, "Let
[1:10:41] your conversation be without
[1:10:43] covetousness and be content with such
[1:10:45] things as ye have. For he that hath
[1:10:47] said, I will never leave thee, nor
[1:10:48] forsake thee."
[1:10:51] See our conversation is not in in the
[1:10:54] scripture our conversation is not
[1:10:56] conversation it's our life it's if you
[1:10:59] look up the word conversation it means
[1:11:01] the manner of life the way of
[1:11:03] living see the things that you he said
[1:11:06] you know if if we love the world or the
[1:11:08] things of the world the love of God's
[1:11:09] not in
[1:11:10] you can't you can't live like the world
[1:11:13] and be a part of God because we're
[1:11:16] supposed to be separate from the
[1:11:19] And you know and the and the problem is
[1:11:21] sometimes and I I want to look at this
[1:11:24] because you know people people you know
[1:11:27] it it's you can't look at somebody
[1:11:30] else. You know I I I tell young people
[1:11:32] sometimes you know just because somebody
[1:11:34] else says that's
[1:11:36] okay. And there may not be anything
[1:11:38] wrong with
[1:11:40] it but I but I want you to have your own
[1:11:43] convictions.
[1:11:47] You know, just because somebody does a
[1:11:48] certain thing, that don't mean it's
[1:11:50] wrong. But you need to have your own
[1:11:53] convictions in your own life and say,
[1:11:54] "Well, you know what? It may be okay to
[1:11:56] do that or may, you know, but I'm not
[1:11:58] going to do it
[1:12:00] because you know what? I'm not
[1:12:01] comfortable with that.
[1:12:04] And then it's okay to do
[1:12:07] that." You know, Paul was talking about
[1:12:09] in the scripture, we're talking about
[1:12:10] people eating meat or not eating meat.
[1:12:13] Well, you know what? If you do a certain
[1:12:14] thing or you don't do a certain thing,
[1:12:16] then it's
[1:12:17] okay. There's not it's not sinful. But
[1:12:21] if you think it's not it's no not okay
[1:12:23] to do this, then don't do it.
[1:12:26] But have your own convictions on
[1:12:29] it. And if somebody ridicules you of it,
[1:12:31] then that's okay. You know, just pray
[1:12:33] for them.
[1:12:37] But don't be but don't ever get to the
[1:12:38] place where you know you're lock you're
[1:12:40] walking lock step because you know well
[1:12:42] everybody in the church does such and
[1:12:45] such come up you know just you you have
[1:12:48] to see these things for yourself. The
[1:12:50] scripture the scripture tells us you
[1:12:52] know to work out our own salvation with
[1:12:54] fear and trembling.
[1:12:56] You got to come up with your own your
[1:12:57] own set of convictions
[1:13:02] and you know and and and because you you
[1:13:04] have to figure out what what is right
[1:13:06] for
[1:13:07] you. You know there's there's certain
[1:13:10] people you know that that after they
[1:13:11] took you know in the in the past you
[1:13:13] know people that taken communion on on
[1:13:15] Sundays you know they would take the
[1:13:17] communion people wouldn't eat for the
[1:13:19] rest of the
[1:13:20] day. And some pe some people believe
[1:13:22] that you know they they eat the Lord's
[1:13:24] supper and after that they don't take
[1:13:25] food for the rest of the
[1:13:28] day. You know that's the reason
[1:13:30] sometimes you know they always made it
[1:13:32] the second service of the day which not
[1:13:35] like we do here but you know I mean but
[1:13:36] in certain people you know they would
[1:13:38] have that conviction they didn't
[1:13:40] eat. Well just because somebody believes
[1:13:43] that or somebody eats after they take
[1:13:45] the Lord's supper then that there's not
[1:13:47] there's not a sin in that.
[1:13:49] But if you have a conviction then follow
[1:13:52] what's on what's your heart because you
[1:13:54] have to come to the place is it against
[1:13:55] the
[1:13:57] word is it but if it's not against the
[1:13:59] word but you don't feel like you feel
[1:14:01] like doing this then then don't do it
[1:14:05] and just because someone else doesn't do
[1:14:07] that you know just like Paul said you
[1:14:08] know I wouldn't eat meat in front of a
[1:14:10] brother that didn't eat meat because I
[1:14:12] wouldn't do it because I didn't want to
[1:14:14] offend
[1:14:15] him but he said you know it's not like
[1:14:18] he wouldn't give up eating meat
[1:14:22] But you know if if it but if it was to
[1:14:24] edify somebody then I wouldn't do it. So
[1:14:27] you have to look at those things to
[1:14:29] understand how how we are supposed to
[1:14:31] process these things about how our life
[1:14:33] is to be to be sensitive to the Holy
[1:14:36] Spirit in the way we live our
[1:14:39] lives and you know and you know because
[1:14:41] there's a lot of people in the world the
[1:14:42] way they live it's you know they live in
[1:14:45] a world of
[1:14:46] legalism and they've not been delivered
[1:14:48] of it
[1:14:50] and all you can do is pray for them
[1:14:53] and just because somebody believes a
[1:14:55] certain way or does a certain way you
[1:14:57] know, then you just pray for them and
[1:14:58] just love them
[1:15:01] anyway. But, you know, you just, you
[1:15:03] know, and if and if somebody wants to
[1:15:05] draw you outside their circle, just like
[1:15:06] brother Brandham said, well, you can't
[1:15:08] draw me out cuz I draw my circle bigger.
[1:15:11] I draw you right back in.
[1:15:15] He said in charity, that's our that's a
[1:15:18] love for one another. The same love that
[1:15:21] he loved us with, we love that. We see
[1:15:23] we express that to one
[1:15:24] another because the same agape love that
[1:15:27] we've received is the same one that we
[1:15:28] show to each
[1:15:30] other. And you know one of the one of
[1:15:32] the aspects of of of this love that he
[1:15:35] showed for one that he said you know God
[1:15:37] showed us love we are ought to love one
[1:15:40] another he said you know how can how can
[1:15:42] you say that I love God and hate your
[1:15:45] brother. He said, 'You know, because how
[1:15:47] can you love your brother whom you have
[1:15:49] seen, you love your God whom you have
[1:15:52] not
[1:15:54] seen. So, you know, if you have if you
[1:15:57] have a place where you get to the place
[1:15:58] where you don't love one another, if
[1:16:00] you've got a all against
[1:16:02] somebody, then like brother R said, you
[1:16:04] know, get rid of that root of
[1:16:05] bitterness, you got to dig it out. You
[1:16:06] got to get rid of it. And he said, and
[1:16:08] whack something that much closer
[1:16:10] together. And the and the same love and
[1:16:13] the and the one thing that you got to
[1:16:14] realize is when you when you love the
[1:16:17] the aspect of agape love is it's it's
[1:16:21] sacrificial there because you know if
[1:16:24] you if you want to if you want to be
[1:16:25] show Jesus Christ you know the love of
[1:16:28] then you it's a
[1:16:31] sacrifice. He loved he loved you and I
[1:16:34] and paid the ultimate sacrifice.
[1:16:37] And it's the same way with you and I. If
[1:16:39] we're going to show the world Jesus
[1:16:41] Christ, it's about our
[1:16:45] sacrifice, how much do we love one
[1:16:50] another? Just like brother Brown talking
[1:16:52] about, you know, when you when you see
[1:16:53] one
[1:16:54] hurting and it's just
[1:16:57] like we all hurt. We we when one was
[1:17:02] blessed, we all rejoice. When one's
[1:17:04] rejoicing, we're all rejoicing. But if
[1:17:05] there's one hurting, then we all hurt.
[1:17:10] And it and you know because there's
[1:17:11] there's no there's no highs and there's
[1:17:13] no lows. There's no big eyes and little
[1:17:15] U's. We're all the same.
[1:17:19] We're all we're all important. We're all
[1:17:22] precious in the body of Christ.
[1:17:26] He said in
[1:17:30] spirit. Second Corinthians tells us to
[1:17:32] cast down imaginations and every high
[1:17:34] thing that exaltth itself against the
[1:17:35] knowledge of God.
[1:17:38] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:17:40] the obedience of Christ.
[1:17:44] He says in
[1:17:46] faith says faith is synonymous with
[1:17:49] trust or belief in the conviction of
[1:17:51] truth of anything and scripture usually
[1:17:53] speaks of believe respecting man's
[1:17:55] relationship to God and divine things
[1:17:57] generally with the included idea of
[1:18:00] trust and holy fervor born of faith and
[1:18:03] joined with it.
[1:18:07] See, you have to take these things that
[1:18:09] are given and have
[1:18:11] faith because he said without faith,
[1:18:14] it's impossible to please
[1:18:17] God. And faith is a
[1:18:21] revelation. and having having that faith
[1:18:24] to put trust in what God
[1:18:27] says and
[1:18:29] understanding that he said, you know,
[1:18:32] we're supposed to honor those that are
[1:18:35] in power over us that God has placed
[1:18:38] over us to honor those, give double
[1:18:41] honor to those and trust those because
[1:18:44] you know, how can you have faith in God
[1:18:46] when you can't have faith in your
[1:18:48] brother?
[1:18:50] If God called a man to stand in the
[1:18:54] place, then how to be a pastor, how can
[1:18:59] you know how how can you put faith in
[1:19:00] God and you can't have trust in a
[1:19:03] man? Because you know what? If if I'm
[1:19:06] looking at the flesh, we can't we can't
[1:19:09] trust in flesh. But you know, I realize
[1:19:10] that there's there's God there. There's
[1:19:13] God behind the flesh. There's God behind
[1:19:16] the flesh.
[1:19:20] And so we can have confidence in our
[1:19:22] brothers and our sisters. Why? Because
[1:19:23] we're all called of God.
[1:19:27] That's the reason I read I don't
[1:19:28] understand people, you know. Well, I I'm
[1:19:31] just I'm just going to push
[1:19:33] play, you know, and you know, we don't,
[1:19:36] you know, we're trying to do away with
[1:19:38] with the five-fold ministry. You know,
[1:19:41] we just we're just going to listen to
[1:19:42] the
[1:19:43] prophet. Well, you know what? God called
[1:19:45] men all the way down from the beginning.
[1:19:47] And he had had men come and speak. Had
[1:19:51] prophets all the way down through the
[1:19:52] scripture. Had men that were called to
[1:19:54] begin to speak. Had called a five-fold
[1:19:57] ministry all down all the way down
[1:19:59] through the church
[1:20:00] ages. And he gets down to the end. And
[1:20:03] you know what? Got that much confidence
[1:20:06] in
[1:20:08] him. It's like, well, well, God, God was
[1:20:11] able to do it all the way till he got to
[1:20:13] the end and then all of a sudden he
[1:20:14] tripped and stumbled and all of a sudden
[1:20:16] we can't we can't we can't put
[1:20:18] confidence in the five-fold
[1:20:24] ministry. Well, it's I mean, it's it's
[1:20:27] that ridiculous.
[1:20:31] But we got confidence in one
[1:20:33] another because you know what I realize?
[1:20:36] I I got confidence in my brothers and
[1:20:38] sisters because you know what? I realize
[1:20:39] if you fall, then guess what? It's my
[1:20:41] job to pray for you to get back up, to
[1:20:44] restore you. And I got confidence that
[1:20:46] you'll get back
[1:20:49] up, that I believe that you'll continue
[1:20:52] on.
[1:20:54] And I got confidence that if I fall,
[1:20:56] then you y'all will be praying for me.
[1:21:00] I got confidence in you
[1:21:04] because I believe I believe God's in
[1:21:06] this body of believers working
[1:21:09] And he said
[1:21:15] impurity. Second Corinthians says, "For
[1:21:17] I'm jealous over you over God with a
[1:21:19] godly jealousy, for I've espoused you to
[1:21:22] one husband that you that I may present
[1:21:24] to you present you as a chase virgin to
[1:21:27] Christ."
[1:21:29] said, "Beloved, now we are the sons of
[1:21:31] God, and it does not yet appear what we
[1:21:34] shall be, but we know that when he shall
[1:21:36] appear, we shall be like him, for we
[1:21:40] shall see him as he is." And every man
[1:21:42] that hath hope in him purifith himself
[1:21:46] even as he is pure. Because we put our
[1:21:49] confidence in him, that we are sons of
[1:21:51] God, then you know what? That we are
[1:21:52] pure through him. That we are purified
[1:21:55] through him through the word.
[1:21:58] And I want to read one more portion of
[1:22:00] scripture. I'll have let's stand let's
[1:22:02] have the musicians come. I want to read
[1:22:03] one more portion of scripture before I
[1:22:05] finish tonight. But this is this is
[1:22:08] Ephesians 4 beginning verse 22. And I'm
[1:22:11] just going to run through this real
[1:22:13] quick. I know y'all starting to get
[1:22:15] tired. So, but I just want to share this
[1:22:17] with you. Verse 22 says that he put off
[1:22:21] that ye put off concerning the former
[1:22:23] con conversation the old man which is
[1:22:26] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[1:22:29] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:22:31] mind that ye put on the new man which
[1:22:35] after God is created in righteousness
[1:22:37] and true holiness. Wherefore putting
[1:22:40] away lying speak every man truth to his
[1:22:42] neighbor for we are members one of
[1:22:44] another. Be ye angry and sin not. Let
[1:22:48] not the sun go down upon your wrath.
[1:22:50] Neither give place to the devil. Let him
[1:22:53] that stole steal no more, but rather let
[1:22:55] him labor, working with his hands the
[1:22:57] thing which is good, that he may have
[1:23:00] that he may have to give to him that
[1:23:02] needeth.
[1:23:04] He said, "Let no corrupt communication
[1:23:07] proceed out of your mouth, but that
[1:23:09] which is good to the use of edifying,
[1:23:12] that it may minister grace unto the
[1:23:14] hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit
[1:23:17] of God, whereby you are sealed until the
[1:23:19] day of redemption. Let all bitterness
[1:23:22] and wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:23:24] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:23:26] malice. and be ye kind one to another,
[1:23:29] tender-hearted, forgiving one another,
[1:23:31] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[1:23:34] forgiven you. Now, I want to I want to I
[1:23:37] just want to share you something with
[1:23:38] you. The first the first verse says,
[1:23:42] "Putting off the concerning the old the
[1:23:45] former conversation, the old
[1:23:49] man." Well, first Timothy says in
[1:23:53] conversation, the first verse, verse 22,
[1:23:56] put off the conversation of the former,
[1:23:59] the old man. He said, "And be renewed in
[1:24:02] the spirit of your mind in spirit." Yes.
[1:24:05] Amen. He says, "And then put on the new
[1:24:09] man which is after God is created in
[1:24:11] righteous and true holiness in spirit."
[1:24:13] He said, "Whereby put away lying, speak
[1:24:15] the truth to the neighbor is which in
[1:24:18] word." He said, "And be angry and sin
[1:24:21] not. Not let the sun go down on your
[1:24:24] wrath." That's in conversation. That's
[1:24:25] the way you live your life. He said,
[1:24:28] "Neither give place to the devil."
[1:24:30] That's in spirit.
[1:24:33] Because the place the devil wants to
[1:24:34] work is in your mind.
[1:24:37] The devil works in the spiritual
[1:24:39] realm. So that's in
[1:24:42] spirit. He said, "And then he that
[1:24:44] stole, let him steal no more." That's
[1:24:46] that's your way of life. That's
[1:24:47] conversation. He said, "Let no evil, let
[1:24:50] corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:24:52] your mouth." That's your words. He said,
[1:24:55] "Enrieve not the Holy Spirit of God."
[1:24:57] That's in spirit. He said, "Let all
[1:24:59] bitterness and
[1:25:00] wrath and anger and clamor be put away
[1:25:04] from you." That's purity.
[1:25:07] And he said, "And be ye kind one to
[1:25:09] another, tend to heart at forgiving one
[1:25:11] another, even as God for Christ's sake
[1:25:13] has forgiven you." And that's in
[1:25:15] charity.
[1:25:17] So, here's Paul writing in Ephesians 4.
[1:25:19] And every one of those scriptures covers
[1:25:21] everything that Paul talks about in 1
[1:25:25] Timothy. Every one of those. And he and
[1:25:27] it's a one passage of scripture. And he
[1:25:29] covered every single one of
[1:25:36] those. And I want you
[1:25:39] to see that.
[1:25:42] Yes. I I want to be closer to God than
[1:25:44] I've ever been. Amen.
[1:25:48] And I I want to be an example to the
[1:25:50] believer of the believers to the young
[1:25:52] people.
[1:25:56] Be thou an example of the believers.
[1:25:58] Yes. Amen. I want I want the young
[1:26:01] people to see Jesus Christ. And I want
[1:26:04] you to have a testimony that people can
[1:26:05] see Jesus Christ in you. Just because
[1:26:09] you're
[1:26:09] young, I want the world to see Jesus
[1:26:12] Christ in you.
[1:26:14] But I want you to see Jesus Christ in us
[1:26:18] in my words and my
[1:26:20] conversation and my faith and my charity
[1:26:24] and my purity. I want you to see Jesus
[1:26:26] Christ in every part of my life. Yes.
[1:26:29] And if there's some part of my life that
[1:26:31] doesn't match up to that, it doesn't
[1:26:33] meet the standard, I want God to work on
[1:26:35] my life. Amen. I don't I don't want
[1:26:38] another day where where there's there's
[1:26:41] some kind of issue and and I don't want
[1:26:42] it just hidden behind some door. I want
[1:26:44] all the doors
[1:26:46] open. I want God to have his will and
[1:26:48] way with us. Amen. Let's all bow our
[1:26:51] heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank
[1:26:54] you for this night, Lord. I know it's
[1:26:56] kind of lengthy tonight, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:59] But Lord, what's been on my heart to say
[1:27:03] and Lord, I I want you
[1:27:07] to just mold us into your image, Lord
[1:27:10] Jesus. If there's anything in our lives,
[1:27:12] Lord, that's not pleasing, Lord Jesus.
[1:27:15] Yes. Lord, I want you to work on my
[1:27:18] life, Lord. I see the hour in which we
[1:27:21] live.
[1:27:22] Lord, we see that we see that the the
[1:27:25] condition the world's in. Lord, we know
[1:27:27] that, Father, the the your coming is not
[1:27:31] too far away, Lord Jesus. Yes. Father, I
[1:27:34] pray that you help us tonight, Lord, to
[1:27:36] to be ready and Lord, lay aside every
[1:27:38] weight and every sin that would so be
[1:27:40] easily beset us, Lord. Lord, to just
[1:27:43] come and and mold us into your image,
[1:27:45] Lord Jesus. Lord, we thank you for your
[1:27:47] word, Lord, as it's come to us.
[1:27:50] Lord, we can see ourselves and sometimes
[1:27:52] we look into the mirror of your word,
[1:27:53] Lord Jesus, and see things that we don't
[1:27:56] like about ourselves,
[1:28:00] Lord. Lord, but we know that the Holy
[1:28:03] Spirit is here to work in our lives,
[1:28:06] Lord, to change these
[1:28:07] things, Lord. We like to have miracles
[1:28:10] take place in our lives, but sometimes
[1:28:12] it's a it's a daily it's a dayto-day
[1:28:15] walk with you, Lord. It's a it it's a
[1:28:17] daily grind,
[1:28:21] Lord. It's a daily overcoming. It's a
[1:28:22] daily dying
[1:28:25] out. And Lord, that's what we're asking
[1:28:28] for, Lord. Lord, you give us strength,
[1:28:30] Lord, by your word, Lord. We are
[1:28:32] strengthened, Lord. We're more than
[1:28:34] conquerors through you to overcome all
[1:28:36] these
[1:28:37] things, Lord. We don't understand why
[1:28:39] the battles are the way they are, the
[1:28:40] things we face, Lord, but we know that
[1:28:42] they all work for our good. Amen.
[1:28:47] And Lord, we just commit ourselves to
[1:28:48] you in the name of Jesus Christ. Father,
[1:28:52] I pray for each one that's here tonight,
[1:28:54] Lord. Whatever the needs may be, Lord,
[1:28:55] whatever the desire is in their heart.
[1:28:58] Lord, when we look into the
[1:29:00] word, Lord, may you will we be molded
[1:29:03] into your image,
[1:29:05] Lord. The prophet said we've been
[1:29:08] invited to be molded into your image,
[1:29:11] Lord. Lord, you've called us to this
[1:29:14] place, Lord. And we just want to
[1:29:15] continue to to walk in in the word that
[1:29:18] you've given us in the in the the light
[1:29:20] of the word, Lord
[1:29:22] Jesus. Lord, as this as the honing time
[1:29:25] has come down, Lord, as the word comes
[1:29:27] in, Lord, it it removes all the things
[1:29:30] of of us, Lord Jesus, of our our human
[1:29:34] humanity, Lord Jesus, everything that's
[1:29:36] contrary to the word, Lord Jesus.
[1:29:40] Lord, that we be molded into your image,
[1:29:42] Lord Jesus. That the world can see Jesus
[1:29:45] Christ. Lord, that we can be pleasing to
[1:29:47] you in everything that we do and say,
[1:29:50] Lord Jesus, we commit ourselves into
[1:29:52] your hands, Lord. Father, we just want
[1:29:54] you to have your will and way with us,
[1:29:56] Lord. Bless the ones that are not here
[1:29:57] tonight, Lord. The ones that are sick,
[1:29:58] whatever the needs are, Lord. Father, we
[1:30:00] just believe that you'll minister to
[1:30:02] each one. Meet the needs, Lord Jesus. as
[1:30:06] we continue to hold them up, Lord, as
[1:30:08] the as the devil has his has his little
[1:30:12] plans and his his way to attack us, Lord
[1:30:16] Jesus, because but we realize it's only
[1:30:18] permitted of you for these things to
[1:30:19] take place, Lord Jesus. But we still
[1:30:22] claim our our healing. We still claim
[1:30:24] our deliverance, Lord. We still claim
[1:30:26] our our families, Lord Jesus. Whatever
[1:30:29] whatever has come against us, Lord
[1:30:31] Jesus, we still believe that you are are
[1:30:34] the answer, Lord Jesus. You're still in
[1:30:36] control. And Lord, we just believe what
[1:30:38] whatever no matter how it comes, Lord
[1:30:41] Jesus, Lord, what whatever it looks
[1:30:43] like, God. We know that you're the same
[1:30:46] yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, we
[1:30:48] we've strengthened in the word, Lord, to
[1:30:52] hold on, to continue to fight the
[1:30:53] battle. Lord, we get weary
[1:30:55] sometimes, but Lord, you said that our
[1:30:58] youth is renewed like the eagle through
[1:31:01] your word. Lord Jesus, we are renewed in
[1:31:04] strength and
[1:31:07] zeal. Lord, I I pray for each one
[1:31:09] tonight, Lord Jesus, whatever the needs
[1:31:11] are, Lord, just give them their desire
[1:31:13] of their hearts, but we commit ourselves
[1:31:16] in the name of Jesus Christ to you.
[1:31:19] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight.
