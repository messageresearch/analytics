um good morning everyone good morning praise the Lord and thank him that we're able to come together again to worship amen and so thank you this morning we're going to read from Psalm 111 verses 1 through 10. and again let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this privilege and opportunity you're given us Lord to come together to worship father we pray that while we're here together that our hearts will be United God in your holy word Lord we ask you just to guide us and lead us each day Lord things that we like Father we pray that we can find them here Lord reaction to strengthen us that we have pure love and understanding Lord of your word Lord that we can look among others Lord and if we see things that we think is not right but let us pray and help them Father and to help each one of us Lord and all things that we do God and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen psalm 111. praise ye the Lord I will praise the Lord with my whole heart in the Assembly of the upright and in the congregation his work is Honorable and glorious his righteousness endureth forever he has given me unto them that fear Him He will ever be mindful of his Covenant The Works of his hands are Verity and judgment all his Commandments are sure he sent Redemption unto his people he has commanded his Covenant forever holy and reverent in his name the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do his Commandments his Praises endureth forever thank you God amen pour out your power and love amenities pour out your power and love is that your desire holy holy holy and I want to see you amen and amen and amen is that your desire then he'll make a way good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scriptures turn them up where we've been reading in Revelations 1. then we'll go to Genesis 1 and then we'll go to Genesis 2. Revelations 1 Genesis 1 and Revelation and Genesis 2. we had a real good time last night at the Bible study you know and if you want to listen to it we have the tapes available but we're still in the Book of Romans but we did get over into at least a seventh chapter last night and trying to finish it up you know the Paul where Paula things I would not I do not know and all of the things are in in the scripture that had a good time remember the fellowship meeting now will be the third Saturday 3 30. remember brother Matthew Bray will be preaching that and at least the morning service following on Sundays or remember those things and uh if you need a place to stay or whatever make sure you talk to somebody or whatever for the uh you know the time of of doing that to where we can you don't have to drive back home and I remember brother now remember brother Gibby he's down at his brothers remember him and remember his brother also that's about all the announcements I think that we have seemed like but anyhow Genesis 1 Revelation 1 Genesis 1 and then Genesis 2. the heavenly father we thank you for this day in your grace and your love thank you for all things because you give them to us freely Lord then we just thank you and we ask you to just help us we know we're not worthy to receive anything from you but yet you made us worthy so there's where the thing is that as long as we rest in you just have your way be with us today in the service and bless remember the sick among us and just come and and Deliver Us Lord from destruction heave our bodies and help us to walk in you God each and every one of us and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations that Wade was doing great I think they said 600 I believe they said was in a meeting last night so he's doing great in moving along you know yeah Revelations 1 12. says and I turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle all right let's go over to revela to Genesis 1 now and read you know 26 and 27 and then we'll go to Genesis 2. and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth an over ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him or it's the male and female created he them all right if we get this far we'll go over to Genesis 2 and 4. these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and ever planted a field before it was in the Earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to Reign upon the Earth and there was no man to till the ground but there went out of mist upon the Earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living Soul that's going down and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed amen you may be seated Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now you don't try to blow your nose or do anything for me today I'm having enough trouble all right I have to do that so if it takes it we puff and puff all right but now we've been talking now for quite a while about how real is God you know and I hope that we have uh been able to plant enough thoughts and ideas about God in his ways and his doing and you know to be able to comprehend in how real he is and remember if we are if we were created of him then he would have to be a whole lot greater than we are because he brought us into being we didn't bring him into being but to bring it down that he's real that he's not like the wind just blowing the Bible says he's Spirit that's fine because then he goes on the prophet to explain that he's a spiritual being he's not just like the wind so it's not to just say well he's just a spirit just floating about and had no form or no no doings you know because the wind has no form to it like it's just blowing and going but he's he is uh even so much a being that he is not omnipresent in the way that we use the word omnipresent because omnipresent means to be ever present and he's not that away because he's a being all right now we've been through those things trying to cover how real that God really is and I hope that I put in enough this is about probably 10 messages at least on that point alone to try to get us to follow the line and see how real and what what we've been trying to talk about all right then we read here in Genesis that this great creator that great God the one that we talked about as being the the all-sufficient one the all things and and how that uh he was so much a being until he was counted to be as a person because you wouldn't count just a spirit as a wind blowing to be a person you would you would try to keep it more or less just floating around but he's real but we've been on it now a couple of services tying together the two of man God coming into being that we can comprehend him and then man coming into being so that we can comprehend what we are he said well we know what we are well that's good you know but do we really know what we are you know can you explain it as job would say you remember that The Book of Job he may he job was a very smart man but God questioned him a good bit about it you know in saying where were you when this happened what was this what was that you know he was uh he kept trying to emphasize that we really don't know what's going on where were we when the foundation of the world was laid what was the doing see we wouldn't we we can't comprehend those things But as God begins to unfold himself to you and I then we would begin to understand who we are and what we're doing and and you know the things of Life all right and we've come over to the point of talking about that you know God was the first creation not that God created himself neither did he create another person or another Identity or anything to come into being as a second person so it's really just human terminologies because that's all we can use to express but it's really talking about him coming in to understanding to the human mind that where we can comprehend a little bit about God and His doings all right and then we came down to where that it would would be that mankind then is we're going to try to pick up today and move a little bit is how real are you that's been our thought a couple of services really how real are you or what is the real you know if it's true about the the point that we can and I believe it is that uh you know you can't destroy the soul but you can destroy the body so then the Soul is more real than the body all right because it will live on after the body is annihilated you know as far as could be blown Smithereens and find nothing of it you know but yet still the soul of mankind will live on somewhere all right so the soul is the real you brother random says on you must be born again he said what is the soul he says it's you you are a soul all right now then what we want to do now for a while is talk about at least a couple of services about how real that is and to think about it and then to get away from the point of us just being some form of this or that or the other or you know we're we're the highest form of animal right in physical creation right but in spiritual creation we are in the image of God all right now I want to deal with that quite at length to make sure that you understand what I'm saying it's not that I'm trying to convince you of it because there would be no way for me to do that anyway I cannot convince you and I cannot reveal it to you I can only speak of the things and let God then speak to you and you know reveal himself to you all right now I want to kind of make it a split condition this morning so bear with me and I'll try to to make sure you know which side I'm split on all right you know which side I'm talking about but see when you read that it says it that Man was created in the image of God all right now we'll get to it in a little bit to prove more about it as a point but that is not the making of mankind I'll prove that in a minute by just a simple little statement the Lord willing but I want you to think about it I want you to think about that even as we'll read Even in our fallen estate you know Fallen condition of mankind that it's amazing what he is because he's he's in a realm of above the animals that the animals cannot reason and do I know you can teach your dog to talk but I will ask you and see I like to say these things uh I'm not a smart alec maybe not smart but an elik or something about it but I like to make statements for you will think now you take a baby it's brought into the world you don't have to go every day to that baby and say hey baby hey baby say this say daddy say mama it helps right okay fine but you know after a while if you just leave the baby alone you know it'll start talking right but you got a dog or a cat or something you got to constantly pound them about say this or do this or do that and I'll reward you to do that and I'll do that see because that animal can't think it works off a reaction from you you know and you say okay now now horse I'm going to touch you with my right hand well it doesn't know anything about right hand it'll never know anything about right hand it just knows which one you raise but the baby after so long it finds out this is the right hand you know by hearing interacting I know that but get the point what I'm saying you don't have to train a baby necessarily to talk it learns to talk because it's listening to you all right but that animal is listening to you all the time and it don't train him all right well because he doesn't have a soul you've got to make him repetitive repetitively repetitively repetitive and keep it going but think of that just as a point of understanding we know that an animal does not have a soul but a human being he has a soul or is a soul is a better way to say because that's his point of what he is but now think with me about the point that we're trying to make man he's he's an amazing thing you just think about what we've went in our lifetime when we when I started as a child you know we went within just a few years you just make outlandish leaps in intelligence you know and no matter if you think how smart your computer is remember the computer was designed by someone smarter than the computer the computer can't think you say yes it does no you give it five choices it's going to answer one of them it's not thinking it has no ability to do that all right it gives you choices and things to go with it but remember no matter how smart you think that computer really is somebody made it and the person that made it is smarter than that and that's why kind of like man does you know I remember reading one time they say about you know when they go to Michael uh down at the house and send it and the things you know and they go to make a law well by the time they get the law finished somebody sitting there has already figured out how to break that legally and get by with it right because that's the mankind all right but now think about it let's think in two ways now first off let's think about just mankind just people mankind is created in the image of God in the bases that he's a little creator he can do things he cannot create but he can take what he has and change it and use it and make it work now not because he's a Christian but because he is a person a being a soul as we would call it a life all right and it's really you know let's see what does it say in Genesis uh that something to the degree that he had to put him out of the garden uh you know because no the the imagination of man's heart mind is continually evil see it keeps on going and going and and doing but that's what I want you to think about and we got a couple of quotes that I want you to to use you know and I want to stay with that point to where that we can follow it but go ahead and pull up number one which is questions and answers in 1954. so let's think about just this man now your mind is supposed to be staying with me as to think about just mankind all right just human just humans all over the world there's seven billion something human beings and all of them to be a human being it takes you to have a body a spirit and a soul to make the human being because that's the the point of it but look what he's just saying he's talking about in the beginning that God made man in his own image is that right then what is God he's a spirit man and we come on down we got through to going through if God made Man In His Image what kind of a man did he make then a spirit man but in Genesis 2 there was no man to till the soul and God made Man Out of the Dust of the Earth not in His image because his flesh man's not made in His image it's in the animal image right come on but in the image of animal life and he put the spirit of man in this animal man here and he became a living Soul all right pull it on up to a point that we want to get to but he's got a soul he's talking about the dumb brute beast and all that they don't have a soul he's talking about man having a soul he's got a soul of God in him what makes him immortal and he can invent look what he can do he's on almost on the equal with God because he's the son of God even in his Fallen estate he's wonderful all right even in his Fallen estate it's wonderful all right he goes on into speaking of the in the message Fellowship I'll just quote these he can build a better house a better way of living better clothes even in his Fallen estate he's still the son of God Fallen why because God is his creator right it don't matter who it is Mama and Daddy might get a body but it takes somebody else to get the soul in the spirit all right now so then he once he he goes on to the inside and saying he gives him attributes to do something to bring himself back to a place trying to where something inside of him tells him that he come from so no matter what about Mankind that mankind you know you go through the to the jungles of Africa you'd go to the North Pole you go to where you want to go where there's no Harley human civilization and a lot of it but yet still those people are worshiping that worship a totem pole they worship an animal they'll worship one because they know that they came from somewhere all right so then man in himself is a marvelous thing all right just a natural man human mankind all around the world look what he's come up with in the past 100 years see I mean I'm I'm 74 and in 50 years of my lifetime say the first 50. it went from so that would be about 1990. see it went from a horse and buggy to an astronaut within a 50-year period and look what it's done since then see no wonder it says its imagination of man's mind or heart you know is continually evil it's it's something within him but in one respect he's wanting to try to get back where he come from it's a prophet said because he realizes there's got to be a creator you know no matter what you want to say you say well there's atheists that don't believe in a God that's idiots all right now you tell me any other word to call them because if you don't believe I mean if you believe you're a human being then you come from somewhere I don't care what you want to run it back to as a pollywog or a frog or or whatever or or to bring it back to energy and this happened and that happened we're worded all of that come from no matter what we say or do it's going to run right back to the point that there has to be a Creator so if you don't believe that there is a God you must believe that you're that God well what's going to happen when you disappear does the world end because you you know you don't believe in it all right well see think about that that mankind in his worst estate he still has that image part of him that contacts him with the Creator you know all right now that's part one okay but it said two parts but part two this man that we talk of in Genesis 1 26 and 27 is not mankind do you want me to go ahead and say it now or do you want to wait a while and think about how dumb I am and try to run it out or do you want to you want to just get to Point up front all right we'll put the point up front had you ever thought about this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27 was male and female right right you agree with that right I wish you had them because you trap Yourself by agreeing with it all right now you tell me Manning it is natural estate as man and woman um when I come into the world I didn't come into the world with male and female they may be some twists and perked up things or problems but Naturally Speaking all right Peggy wasn't in me right all right see if anything we came in the woman's side because we were in our mothers right but I still don't make us that one does it you understand what I'm getting at so I like to look at things like that I was you know writing notes and then then I just sit back and I read over those notes and I read over and I'll read them and I change them and I move them and that's why they their brothers will look they'll see they'll be scratched out places and things on my notes that I move that up to here and nobody don't follow me in my cut and tape anyway but but then after a while I get a thought and I thought oh Lord thank you now was any of you in your beginning male and female was your wife in you right well see that's where people get all these things you know when they think about these soul mateings and all of this you know and there's doctrines of that idea evidently must be a lot of them in the message because it sure is a lot of polygamy in the message people but do you understand my point mankind was not created male and female I said mankind right is that enough to solve the problem I'll quote that I've got it circled a good many times throughout the message to repeat it for you to think about it but this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27 and over into verse 28. he is a very special man because he is created male and female he's created as we'll get to it later in the message not today that brother Branham said Eve was in Adam and theophany in the original creation of do it and said Eve was in Adam in the physical all right so then the 126 man is not just the creating of mankind because if it was then worse you may on female part today and I agree that some that act like look like male and act like female I go along with you but it still don't work but do you see my point even in his Fallen estate he is in the image of God because of being a person a human being a soul you know real and uh but then when you come to the creation there of Genesis 1 26. 27 then that must not be just all mankind that must be a special creation or else you've run aground all right let's read what the prophet had to say about this on questions and answer go ahead with number four no questions and answers in 1962. and look what he says he's talking about and Eve and now you know the wife and everything now notice in Genesis 1 21 God created the whales in the sea he done everything and made the creation made man in his own image made man not a man whole man all of them in his own image see and after the image of God created he them male and female created him both like that all right now you can take that quote and make it say what you want it to say can you read it put it back up and let's look at it you can make that quote say what you want to make it say and that's the smartness of mankind with the ability but with the thought we just brought up to the point that all mankind could not be created male and female right Now read that with the thought made man in his own image made man not a man whole man all of them in His image as I said you can read that you can read that and say that God made man made man not a man he made whole man all of them in his own image you can read it but we're thinking about about be in the image of God because of the point of the male and female that this man was made now you've got to come back and think all right so we didn't make mankind in His image he made a man made man not a man he made a special person right there all right we know that this is in reality the creation of Adam that we'll get to it later that brother Branham said Eve was in Adam and theophany we'll get to that and try to divide it into a message but the main thing we want to do is look at it that let's just don't look at it then at all mankind in the image of God let's get down to find out who this is that he created all right so we can bring it to Adam for an example do you notice in the word I said Adam then you can be used as an example because he's the beginning of the creation of God in the natural part of mankind you know the first one all right now but this man has got to be a special man all right and if it's true the quotes that we read from the prophet that God is real that God is trying to condescend downward and that his first creation was himself not meaning that he created himself but meaning in Breaking that word down to understand that it means he simply came into being right not a creation right God who created who you remember the quotes we gave where the Prophet said people think multitudes think that God created Jesus and Jesus created everything else he said that's not true but we do know by the Bible of John 1 Hebrews 1 Colossians 1 Ephesians 2 3 and 9 that Jesus Christ is the creator and we know when we used it there this past weekend about or this yeah about the uh man coming into being as being in the image of God and whatever God was that's what man would be or you're just trying to make something to look like you're using the word image as to something to look like well brother Brandon said Jesus was then very image of God now did you just look like him but then he turns around and what he says he said that he was either God or the biggest deceiver of this ever been all right so now if man is created in the image of that man that created him then with this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27 and going into verse 28 of course it goes into the two and would that be another person a separate person or the same person now brother Dale you're getting a little bit too close because you're talking a lot about making us be God well I thought that's what the Bible said that it was God's whom the word come to you know now we've got the quotient the prophet don't worry about it don't get run off and think well boy you're really messing up brother random said Adam was not the god of the of the heavens he was the god of the Earth we are not to be the god of Heaven he's the god of Heaven we are the god of the Earth and brother Brown said I long to see the time that these Sons and Daughters would come to realize that they're the gods of the Earth are you trying to control the heavens and the biggest part I'm not trying to control except one thing that's this part that you're looking at that ought to be my concern all right now so we covered stage one or thought one that human mankind because of who he is and the way he was brought into being that he's a wonderful person and constantly creating you know taking what we got putting it together making it going and doing building better houses building better cars and building you know Donnie likes to ride in his little way model but even he wouldn't want to take that 30-hour trip we took to Texas a couple of years ago in that little away model I don't think so you know I'd rather be up here a little bit more modern especially I want the air conditioning to work you know all right but see then that man being there would be all it's all right to talk about him as being in the image of God all right but it's really not speaking of him because like I said now if he's created in the image of this man the Bible emphatically States about four times three or four between 16 17 and 18. that this man was created male and female right and Mankind's not made that way so this is not the creation of just mankind this is the creation or coming into being of God in another form called a son because that Son of God was back before the foundation of the world what was he the Son of God was the Creator God that's even what Peter said see that we talk about there where he said Thou Art the Christ now he didn't just stop there he defined who he was speaking of and what Jesus was he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now the Bible doesn't call him God the son right that don't work because that goes into the wrong thing Peter was that Jesus was the one who created all things the Christ the son of the Living God not another person remember God came himself right he didn't send a son he came himself because if he sent a son that would be eternal sonships and we don't believe in that all right do you understand then this man must be something special of Genesis 1 26 and 27. and how that that man that was Dire that even Naturally Speaking Eve was in Adam right amen all right but I go back to the point now and I keep making it Peggy wasn't in me now that's uh now there's only one man that can be what you want to talk about and that's the man Christ Jesus because remember now go ahead and jump down a little bit let's pick up number eight if you will brother which is demonology Physical Realm 1953. but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image Spirit of man not a man in his own image right because the man this physical was made an image of animals all right but man in his own image see then he made them male and female before he'd ever had a man in the dust of the Earth wish we had a chance to explain that so then this man you're talking about was male and female in his original creation before the foundation of the world are you with me this soul that we talk about this being that we talk about in in in Genesis 1 is not the physical creation of a body we know better than that right because we know that that Genesis 1 was a spiritual creation and we know that Genesis 2 is the physical creation all right Even Adam himself was made a very special person because even the point of the physical part you know in physical part Eve was in Adam right right took a rib made Eve now flesh of Flesh bone a bone you know he was a very special Creation in the beginning because he would be the beginning creation all right So Adam came here with Eve in him brother Brown says Jesus came here with us in him and we surely want to talk about that as a spiritual creation right not a physical but think about it think about what you're saying so this man that was created in the image of God is not a physical creation it is the spiritual creation which to me then means the same is that Jesus that God didn't create Jesus and Jesus create everything else Jesus was almighty God and back there when it came forth that's to create Torah remember it was like a little child playing before the father's door we gave those the other day and bringing it down and getting it to a point to see that Christ the word the logos feet word then is the creator all right all right and that's not a second person right right either Jesus was God made manifest or you and I have really got things messed up we better go find us a good Catholic and kiss the Pope's toe and forget the whole thing you say well you shouldn't make it like that well what's the difference you're gonna go find your good Baptist they just as messed up as the rest of them a good methodists or a good Pentecostal why not just go all the way back and kiss the old post hole and say Bud take care of this we don't believe that do we no we don't believe that well then we shouldn't believe a lot of the other things that we do and it shouldn't be confusing when we start talking about this that the condescending of God that he was coming down to the point of where he started to create and to do the things and that would be the the son of God the Creator well then Adam now let's bring up we'll get to quote in a little bit some was God's created son Jesus Was His only begotten son all right showing that Jesus the Christ not the flesh man would be the man that would create the Genesis 1 26 and 27 man or would be him in another form I think it's about time we rub out a little bit of our thoughts you know and say well you know you just look like you're getting a little bit too deep if you want your sugar tits go back where you come from and that's not sarcastic that's truth if that's what you want and that's what you want to follow I have no problems no building didn't get full by me going out and drumming up people on the side of the road to try to get them to come to church right but if you want to stay here and listen then let's talk about some things that have some understanding to it instead of whether we should wear pantyhose or whether we should wear two-toned shoes or you know let's get on with something to eat I love beans and taters I sure do I was raised on them but I also love a good steak but I don't want steak all the time I'm honest I'd prefer the beans and taters over the steak if you're going to try to make me on a a one-time you know that's all you're gonna get to eat well I wouldn't I'd take the beans and taters and let you have a steak because I wouldn't want your steak every day all right I love the simple things of God that we talk about but I think that there's nothing in God that's not simple right I think that's where our problem is we think it's deep but you know what it is because somebody brought out something that's contrary to your thinking now come on don't raise your hand don't smile but how many of you was thinking about that Genesis 1 26 would be basically all man but then I come up and say well now wait a minute if it's all manned then all we got to do is get that female out of that man see that my wife should have come out of me I said well that's silly now you're the one that's silly because of your thinking but then when you get exposed you get all upset remember the other day what I was saying if you got that true Holy Ghost Inside of there you ain't going to argue with what I'm saying if it's truth but there's going to be this body in this Spirit part of us is going to reveal until that inside man says shut up he's right it can't be no other way see then things starts lining up all right because your souls were made up before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image Spirit of man not a man in his own image but man in his own image what a special man that he made to be what and he made them male and female before he ever had a man in the dust of the Earth so the soul of man was created before the world ever begun now um I don't know where to go into that this morning with it or later this evening but uh because I don't want to put out too much in their thinking you think I do but I try to that's why I tear up a lot of notes and a lot of paper it goes in the trash can and I redo and go again because I try to think like you think and I try to think on the basis of humanity of how that we think and I try to think about how that I can use that to contact the end part of the inward part of you instead of your body you know because that would would do but just think of just stay with me and think about it think about this man this made in Genesis 1 26 and 27. that he was made before the world now don't get all involved in predestinations and pre-existences and and things like that that's why I said I didn't know where to bring that in don't get all tied up in those things just stay with me of what I'm thinking about that this man would be a special creation and it wouldn't be a physical creation it would be a spiritual creation and it wouldn't be a creation as much as it would be that God is expanding himself God is constantly going out like Aaron was over there and there Wednesday night when you talk about Infinity if you cut it in half you still got Infinity okay and see the longer that God goes to me the more will be unfolding even when we get there it'll just be constant unfolding of the word of God and we won't have these carnal Minds to deal with all right but you see then this man that was created in Genesis 1 he was put in the man of Genesis 2. correct all right and you know what is we'll get to it later the prophet said he was lonely and a reason or Lonesome if you you don't let don't run in lonely you won't find it run in launch some if you're going to study on your computer that he was lonesome you know why he had no help me physically Eve within him at that time but once he had already been placed over there into flesh Eve was still in theophany now you better start realizing this man that you're talking about in Genesis 1 26 and 27 is the theophany man now get away from all of that but brother Dale my theophany is up yonder I hear it calling me but Rhino said on who this melted dick when you got born again you heard from it well did you hear from it up there remember there's no two eternities so when it says we have one in Heavens eternal support safe you see it's demanding that we try to use these Cranium caps that we call a brain because that's the one I got to talk to but I'm trying to speak to the one that's inside of you I'm trying to talk about salvation and what's doing and we don't believe in pre-existence of Souls that's a Mormon Doctrine but I do believe in pre-existence of God right I do believe in pre-existence of him and his being don't you so whatever he would be is pre-existence and brother random will state what you always was eternal now we know for certain this not the body we know for a certainty it's not the spirit so then he's got to be speaking of the inward part of us called the soul all right but just remember also on who is this male chastity that you bypassed your theophany we'll get to that we're going along but I want you to think with me how real is your god and then how real are you do we even consider how real we are do you realize that brother Branham said that if it wasn't for the bar that God was holding that you would create a world and go live on it paraphrasing it it's close you know that he said if you take it whether Aaron talking about Wednesday night the word of God upon your lips and speak is deity speaking you realize those quotes well is that just a thought coming from up yonder somewhere or is it coming from within which one is it when brother Brandon would say thus saith the Lord or even I say you know to you was that way up yonder I remind you that he said brother said Moses got the thought he said first it was a thought he said then Moses got to thought he said it's not word yet he said because Moses has got to speak it all right we're going to have to speak a lot of things in in our lives whether you believe it or not or believe you can do it you know I don't understand though how come we don't trying to illustrate a little bit last night the brother was telling that that he loved music in his early life you know and that those things bother you know but you know what I thought about and I told him I said you used to you didn't have anything inside of you fighting about that you just all music you know you just all the world but I said ain't it a wonderful or opponent of trying to bring into wonderful thing that you could finally realize that there's something inside of you don't want to do that let's say something inside of you that don't want to follow that music and that inside of us that don't want to follow that music may take a whole lot of these virtues to be able to get us to the place that we don't jump around and move a little bit when the music comes right so we're just talking about salvation well do you see what the prophet is saying not the physical man wasn't created before the foundation of the world but this soul that he's speaking of here and that my watch because I've got it in my notes for later you say well with all mankind created before the world in the mind of God there's the defining of the difference in a point all man before the world God in his mind knew every person that would ever be born is that true and he could write their names in the lounge book or leave them out on the last book right because that was in his mind but that was in his mind of what would happen when mankind got here right right but what about the group of people that job was asked a question where Were You When The Morning Star signed together and the sons of God shouted for joy brother Brown said that's for the foundation of the world when they saw the Plan of Salvation now you're getting the only one I got in pre-existence this man of 126 and 27 is a special man if you want no problems to cover it that's the Christ that's the logos that's the great words we use theophanes and all of the things that we try to follow you know this man here was created before the world but remember when he would say you always was eternal he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal and over in the Little John's it says that this person cannot sin because the seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin but then he turns around and says we sin every day now you got Mass confusion no you don't if you got it right that seed cannot sin he talking about me and you talking about that seed ain't no way that seed can sin because that seed is Christ you didn't come into the world with eternal life that's what we'll get to later Adam was the first one and he come into the world standing there and he breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul what was he before he breathed into his nostrils you see we we try to take a lot of things but we need a lot of understanding don't we but if I can confuse you enough to get you to study then I've done my job just as well as it is if I've tried my best because that's that's the way I'm doing the happy brother brother there you're trying to confuse us no listening I said if I can do that if I can confuse you then there's one thing about it you don't know what the truth is right if I can take away his brother Al said why don't you go direct brother down get him let him talk you out of what you believe if I can talk you out of what you believe then you got a very flimsy belief but think about it this man of 126 and 27 is not a physical man we know that because he put into the two seven which is a physical man right right and while he's in this spiritual creation he's both male and female right now we want to put it over in flesh as male and female now according to the Bible and according to the prophet according to what I just read here about what he says is your souls were made up before the foundation of world when God created man in his own image Spirit of man not a man in his own image but man in his own image and then he made them male and female before he ever had a man in the dust of the Earth so this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27 is both male and female right now if that wasn't true folks remember I don't throw off on the sisters but I do try to preach the truth remember sisters you have no hope whatsoever except for the man that you're under so you better have a head somewhere and that's what we're talking about because well I've never been married or anything within your father's your head until you get married and then your husband's your head then something goes wrong to argue that's going to turn to God to be your head no I'd turn to start with no he can't turn to start with because he's put all them other things in the coin I didn't do that he did he put that you're under your father that's the Bible he puts her under your husband that's Bible but then when you come to the point that you don't have one see then you can go to God right but you won't throw off on the others because you'll realize it's true all right now listen according to Ezekiel 18 4 the Bible says behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul incentive shall die Peter of souls you know the two Soul Doctrine Satan give you a soul and this that and what Satan can't give you a soul he can't create he can pervert but he can't create I mean only God can create because All Souls no matter whether it's Christians or or lost All Souls belong to God now he didn't give them to you wrong he gives every baby a choice of free moral agency but I told you about my brother he said God can't blame me for being wrong he made me wrong I said no he didn't make you wrong you got 12 years College which you can't got common sense she didn't make you wrong he made you perfect you went wrong because of the condition and the life you lived so you can't blame God for saying we're blame Mom and Daddy well okay if you don't got a drink because my Mom and Daddy drank that's a flimsy excuse but it made and made it it made a a a a a gene in me I'd done been through all of that they try to prove this that and the other I done told you where I stand you say well homosexuality is a gene as well no it's a hereditary trait of where you live and what's going on it's a simple fact of you close your eyes and don't use them after a while they'll go away is that right they found animals out in in the dark parts of the ocean and has no eyeballs why because they don't need them I can't help but being an alcoholic my daddy was an alcoholic and I know now you get into drugs you got a lot more to deal with but that still is not the answer you can't lay back on that my daddy would I come in the world of drug you know if you get born again he'll take care of the druggie now as a human being that may be true that you'll follow that but if you're born again it'll take care of those times remember no longer can it be said that the fathers are ate grapes in the children's teeth were on edge that is in the Bible you know all right but listen this man that was created there was not the physical man it was the man in the image of God all right what is God then this would be the son of God right right and that's why in the only one in the Old Testament that had eternal life was Adam and Eve we don't want to put that in there because we still want her to be a dog meat see then Jesus Christ when he came he didn't just have eternal life it wasn't imparted to him he was eternal life it was imparted to Adam to have what he had so this man that we're talking about this Genesis 1 26 27 but was created before the world not just in the mind of God wait a minute you're getting too close well I like to ride the edge this man was brother Branham says it now we'll get to it it's on Blasphemous names he said especially into Adam he breathed the breath of eternal life what did he do with Adam he put Genesis 1 into Genesis 2. is that sensible and he said especially into Adam eternal life he says but I didn't I didn't think nobody could be Eternal until Christ came remember this is the creation and the creation always Begins full grown except the Lord Jesus which had to be to all man all things and then he would have to be a baby and come forth to be that but remember still he was the beginning of the creation of God remember he didn't become Eternal on the River Jordan that's what they're saying he was just a man till then and then he become Eternal and then Eternal left him and then he died of man well if he did you know how no savior that's plain sins but are you listening what was made what was back there before the world go ahead with number nine we bypassed a few quotes we can get back to them when we need them but look what your Prophet has to say on the modern events made clear by prophecy increases 65. but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ I wish you would one day take a dictionary and look up Gene and look up germ I may be wrong in it but I think it's right it's the gene first where's the nurse is at around here somewhere got a couple of them it's Gene first I think right because that's due and then it turns into a germ because that's later on it has to developed to be a germ and if you study the prophet's message from Gene and germ form you might learn a lot all right because it means stages of development see it's Gene germ seed right all right but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world oh you believe in pre-existence I believe in pre-existence of that soul which is the soul of God I do that I always believe that God's eternal a soul of God that was in God before the foundation World remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ reconcile the world to himself do you believe that look he was in Christ then if you were in God a gene a word a attribute from the beginning then you walk with him here on Earth you talk with him on Earth you suffered with him on Earth you died with him at Calvary and you Rose with him again and now you're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus communing with him the word as it feeds upon feeds into your soul that man shall live by every word that proceedeth okay we want to go with this don't we just leave it right there we want to go with this we want to believe we was in Christ and we walk and we've done all these things but we don't want to believe we was up here in him now that's who I'm talking about I ain't talking about a bunch of little Souls running around up in heaven I don't believe that that's Mormon Doctrine to pre-existence if we were a part of God before the foundation of the world then we're part of God now we just remember now we've got to cover it that you bypassed what you should have been and come into World lost and we receive eternal life here no I always always Eternal well why is your face red you know why is that Spirit getting all upset in you yeah but I got where the Prophet said it he said we always was eternal yeah read before and after if you have eternal life you always was eternal what the life eternal life but there was a time we didn't have it you know that right around him said on birth pain he said it was so hard to get those religious Pharisees to realize they were Sinners or lost now this is his words that he could die for him you know the hardest thing that I've had in my life as to try to minister to people is to try to get people to realize they're lost little you know you're saved because I've got another statement to make behind that one okay because if you're saved you cannot deny the word right you see why Reed did that's not me saying it you got to admit that I do tell you where the Prophet said this and I invite you to go find things different and coming let's talk about it from the shine prophet's message and let's talk about it but let's don't get in our own philosophies you know let's get in the Bible in the prophet's message and just see what it says random one time he said what he said you start your eternal life right here at the altar well that was back in 59 before he he really seen what it should have been in 63 and oh you're beautiful that's that mind that man that's created that has the ability to think to reason to do and I realized talking to you that's why it's hard sometimes to put up quotes I've thought about putting it up one line at the time because see a lot of you are reading down here and I'm up here or a lot of you I'm down here and you're still up here am I right okay I got a couple of rides let me get one more quote and we'll quit all right go ahead with number nine there wait a minute let's see we got 10. where he walked with him and talked with him let's get one more which is 1960 the queen be number 11 brush and look what your Prophet had to say about the Queen of Sheba 1960. e75 wrote it on up to the other you read in between there see for what I'm doing dry and when the the life that was in the animal that died the animal could not come back and be a spirit with the human being because it was animal life without a soul but when Jesus died it was a soul of God now you tell me your God didn't die go ahead argue all you want to do and when the cell that was broke it Sanctified a church that the Holy Ghost would come and live in it then it's God above us God With Us is God in us who was Jesus God almighty right did he have a soul there's a couple of quotes beyond our the Bible speaks of the Soul the Bible speaks and said in my soul is troubled the the the Redemption we talked about last week the things that are and then when you come on down we brought it to the prophet where he was saying what that he said in body he was you know I'll get these in repeating the seed and said in body he was a man was sitting Soul he and he was God he said in body he was a man he said in spirit he was God all right so when that baby was born there was the body the spirit the soul the body of creation not by mankind with the soul wouldn't of creation and neither was it an impartation as Adam had to be he was God see you don't think about him being Body Spirit and soul do you you don't think about Jesus as being Body Spirit and soul remember that's what he was and that's what you are his soul went to hell right he sold his theophany his person of his being you remember that quote went to hell the spirit went back to God who gave it the body went in the grave and his soul went to hell was it a spirit floating around and going down into hell where those people were there in there so that's why brother Branham will use Soul as theophany for the sinner because it's simply the word theophany means a body of deity or whatever your deity is whatever your leading is this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27 was a very special creation because it was really an impartation on God it was God not just being over there and you know he that part that went out is that man that was standing there we went through those over and over and over a part of God I I don't see how you talk about a part of God just remembered my statements is any part of God is God any water out of the ocean is the same chemical of the ocean is counted on volume and just remember we the prophets that are part of God see months and months and months and I've been driving all these things hoping that you'd listen and I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but how many of you went back and listened to some of these tapes how many has even heard what you missed I go back and listen to my own messages when I get a chance I do I love to do it I sit there and cry know how great I am but how great God he is that can reveal himself to mankind through a prophet to bring us a message for us to see God I thought that was what our whole thing was to be in here come on musician I thought that was what we wish to be here you know I I thought we was to be here to learn of God yeah but you just confused I didn't confuse you honey you was confused already I just exposed your confusion put it out in the open to let you see that you're confused I didn't make you that but just remember one thing your body and your spirit May argue with me about a lot of things but if you're born again that inside man ain't going to argue about the word it's going to stay with the word here regardless let's stand what do we got brother 333 just a minute and then we'll go 3 333 333 anybody have a need the altar's open all right Jesus silver and gold think about it I'd rather have Jesus than anything away oh I'd Rather Have Jesus Lord Jesus our brothers got an opportunity to talk about a job we know he needs one but we just asking now to go make it manifest let him see whether it's you or not let him understand and be guided by your love in Jesus name you know that reminds me of something happened in my life a lot of you know about it I was offered a job one time of being an insurance salesman we owned back at that time I wasn't making very much money it was very you know they offered me everything in the world to try to make it right or that I could be an insurance salesman and you know I wasn't even uh born-again believer but I asked God I said let this thing be one way or the other and you showed me in this where you want me to do the man sat down and he said what you gonna do Sam I said I'll move down because I would get a whole County come on so I'd move down there and the first thing I do I'd find me a good church to join because back then I was a good Baptist and I saw find me a good church is on he said Sam said join the First Baptist well see he was right mentally speaking he said calls in the First Baptist is where all the people is at with the money go to that First Baptist well that was right that was exactly right I walked out of there and I said Lord I will not take that job because I'd ask him to tell me and I saw what it meant it didn't mean for me to stay the same as I was and just move on it meant to move into some kind of worldly event for her you know and I knew I wasn't going to do that trust him I'd rather relaxed you heard our brother he had physical needs you touch him but he has a spiritual need here Lord about his mother-in-law and he's standing here Farm we send this prayer clock Lord that this chemotherapy thing that they do we know it had horrible side effects but we ask you father to change it to where it was we believe that as well as anything else in Jesus name amen be true I'd Rather Have Jesus you dismissed remember the service this afternoon Lord Jesus just bless everybody take care of everybody foreign foreign
