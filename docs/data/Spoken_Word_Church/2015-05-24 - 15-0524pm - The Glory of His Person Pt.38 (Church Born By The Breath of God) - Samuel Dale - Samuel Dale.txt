TRANSCRIPT
========================================
cause I'm holding through the promise where two or three agree God's gonna do the same you and me but I believe it is while they supposed thank you on the top of Mount Zion is reached the city all that City on Mount Zion blow up Pilgrim yet I love these things when I reached that City only all that cities Messiah foreign service you know and don't have something the Lord gives it to you right what a blessing Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of my heart in the Eyes of My Heart amen I want to see you to see you shining in the light of your glory amen pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy amen shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy amen holy holy holy you are a holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen and amen and amen you want to see him then just look into the word and you'll find him amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scriptures turn where we were reading this morning Revelations 1 and then we'll go to Ezekiel 37. the Valley of the dry bones remember now the announcements that brother Bob will we preaching the Lord willingness come in Wednesday and then the Bible study will be on the uh first Saturday in uh June and in remember the announcements of the Father's Day to Gathering and the sisters together and remember that and remember brother Vernon will be here the weekend the Fourth of July expecting a real good time and a celebration time in the Lord man so let's just be much in prayer for those things remember those that are not with us because of being sick and the different things and the ones that are traveling and everybody's going about the country now so we get their travelings done in their vacations times and and all having a good time we appreciate all of that because we we do like to see people go visit and do things and just then come back and we all can Fellowship together right amen so let's let's see Ezekiel 37 right Revelations 1 Ezekiel 37. Lord Jesus we love you we thank you Father for all things we just ask you Lord that you would just come today and speak to our hearts that you'd give understanding to each and every one of us that we may walk in the light of Your Love because that's our desire and that's our thoughts what is it for the world what is it or anything out there that's worth anything it's all fastly going away but yet we know that your word is forever settled and we'll keep unfolding And We Praise Your Great Name God each one remember the sick ones Among Us and father remember the the ones that are traveling take care of everybody give a safe journey let your love be with each and every one and guide each one in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 I mean one and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch for the Golden Girl now remember I told you that we are preaching this scripture but we're using other things so you know you might wind up in but or to pay attention to the things that we're reading in the scripture because see now we're talking about when in missing the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man well then we're going to Ezekiel all right so I would pay attention we made one of these days say well I'm finished with that and we'll go on you know but it says his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow in his eyes where's the flame of fire and his feet like undefined rice if they burned in a furnace in his voice as the sound of many Waters and we'll go to Ezekiel 34. he's talking about the Valley of the dry bones so he says in verse streak and these bones live and he said uh he said I know us verse 4 he says and again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh you dry bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and I will lay sin you upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and Boulder shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when I beheld low this in you and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet and exceeding great Army so you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now to try to you know back up on her message this morning because we this is we'll put it in two parts but we titled the first part this morning Breath of God because that was what we were talking about and then we will put this one apart as Church born by the Breath of God because that's what we're talking about getting into this evening but did you follow me this morning to make sure because I don't want you to misunderstand so you can you try to make something hard for make people to see it and then they back away like I said I preached one day here for about an hour and a half on manifestation of the spirit and a brother went home to eat lunch with me and first thing he said you don't believe in manifestation do you and I've spent an hour and a half trying to show what I was talking about but see that's it's just what you get your mind locked and you know and then you'll wind up losing the entire point or thought of what somebody is saying so that's why I keep over it a lot of times over and over it so don't get in your mind that I'm not saying that God can like that and do things you know I'm not trying to emphasize that my point is emphasizing that whether he breathes he still has to speak that it's not just that he breathed he said something you remember there in John and we were talking about it and said you know and he breathed upon the disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost well see he said something the main thing is there's something to be said like I said about a a baby dog it'll come out it'll whine whine and do a little bark but he can't talk but then a baby it comes out you know and a baby and and it'll cry you don't have to teach a baby to cry it'll do it and take care of that but then you've got to teach it how to talk all right so then there's something about the vocal cords of mankind and the animal world that will work to a degree as the air flows across to make sounds and other things you know utter utter things and uh but what about something that can a human being that can talk see then if you really understand what I'm getting at it's the deeper meaning part of you that's doing the talking it's just like I said you don't see with your eyes all right you see from the inner part of your being and if God would ever allow you to do that he did me one time that he allowed me to walk back in my mind in my eyeballs and they just went like a telescope back and I seen a person as they were as he was looking at them I didn't see him with a condemnation that I had about that person I could see how he saw him you know because that was something that was related to me all right so then the the what causes you to be able to speak words would have to be something in a deeper meaning a part of you than to just be the spirit of mankind it would have to deal with your soul your being of what you are and and the person that's within you not somebody standing inside of you see that's what we think we get our minds old so many carnal thoughts and all until we miss the whole truth but what has been in our point that what you're born by the Breath of God is that what we want to get into the afternoon and begin to see and the God then did he breathe upon him see the wind that was coming in the uh Upper Room the wind that you know the Bible remember there was a great wind doing but that wasn't the new birth it was when that Lake of Fire set on each one of them and then that was where the word Was Made Alive and it wasn't just a wind blowing to make alive brother Joe uh brought it to my attention I'm glad to hear what other people think you know and uh he gave me a point that like in in Acts 2 and 2 uh it talks about the wind and you know look that up that means Breath of God would you look up the others and it'll just mean wind blowing it's only like I believe it was two he said in the Bible that relates to the Breath of God when you're using the word wind so then see look at it and try to see what I'm talking about more than the words that I use because I don't have that education I'm sorry I don't I try to put it as best as I can to help you to understand but see I believe you are born by the word that has been planted in you by someone you know that you heard the word even if it was reading the Bible you heard the word someone put that there and that goes within you and it becomes part of that inward being that we call a soul being a part of us and then when the Holy Spirit quickens that word it makes that word alive right around and said the Holy Ghost is in there waiting on you to bring him the word but he said when he brought when you bring him the word he can make it alive all right but what if we don't bring him the word you know what if we try to bring him everything else or what if we try to bring him incorrect word you know perverted word the seed word of mankind ideas of doctrines and opinions that's why it's so important the prophet said of the word that was planted all right and if he was so uh you know so set on that as being serious about it why shouldn't we be well brother Dale you don't have to make it so God can just do what he wants to that's right he can just leave us sitting in our little pity Patty hold and just go on off and let us go and be justified in doing it because we are the ones that pull ourselves back in those holes and and doings in the things of Life all right now so what is the New Birth the birth of the word the words you've held it becomes in that inner being of that soul that we are and that Soul as I told you it takes remember the message the other day we've been our soul has been molding all of our life because soul is what you are person being heart whatever you want to call the wording that's what you are but it's that character that nature that doings it has been being molded within us all of our lives and you know that's where God begins to work because he doesn't work on the body he doesn't work on the spirit that's where it couldn't be understood if you worked on the body and the spirit then Abraham and them had it because Abraham walked with God you know Abraham was called a friend of God David in his worst things was called a man after God's Own Heart that's right but see there was no way to get that that word in their soul to be made alive they're understanding that remember this morning their understanding of a certain way or whatever God wanted to reveal for the time and the doings that could be done all right so the disciples remember he opened their understanding we read it there in Luke he opened their understanding of the word he breathed on them John is putting the two together John and Luke would be saying the same that in Luke it says he opened her understanding and told him to go away to Pentecost he breathed on them in John 20 and said receive ye the Holy Ghost but that was a promise they couldn't get it right then because Jesus had not been crucified and not been glorified all right so there was no way for that to take place it had to wait until he could come inside to where it would be an under an inside teacher to understand the word of God all right see then in doing that we see that it is truly the birth of the word the birth of what we hear all right we believe too that what we're saying at the end there that what that the seed comes through the body it does in the natural it comes to the body to the you know the the quickening of the egg of the female that she produces that brings the body all right but it comes through spiritual multiplication is what we're doing right now I mean the preaching of the Gospel is spiritual multiplication it's planting of the seed and that that's why I've tried even to tell you the natural part you look at it and you see why so many preachers run off after polygamies and different things because they're dealing with the word of God that is a seed and the first thing you know it just goes from one seed to another seed to another seed and the first thing you know they're off into polygamy why because it's sowing a seed preaching the gospel is sowing the seed all right but see what are we talking about he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost a promise go to the upper room and wait a promise all right one day that promise was fulfilled on the death Pentecost where the holy ghost coming all right then we went back to Ezekiel that we just read and Ezekiel gives you the same layout for the for the Jews coming the Israelite as what we receive the coming because you know it had been eaten away in the Gentile dispensation we covered it go to to Restoration of the Bride tree where it was four messengers of death Cancun Locust caterpillar they ate the bride down all right then it started back in Luther's justification Wesley sanctification Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost but then the word all right then you can see where everything is perfectly in order in that way don't do away with none of these believe it Luther's message was right Wesley's message was right the Pentecostal message was right it wasn't just gifts but that's what everybody well Luther didn't know nothing but oh you got it all well where'd you get it if you don't have something put a foundation home hey the prophets built the body right but you know what they put it on a foundation of Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph right the Patriarchs then the prophets could build the body without the foundation where are you going to set it all right so then we take Luther Wesley Pentecost justification sanctification the baptism on the Holy Ghost that's why I said it so tricky right in that form until people will lose what you're saying because there's only three stages to life right justifications same case of baptism of the Holy Ghost water and blood spirit all right but then when you come to Restoration you go to four stages because you come to Azusa Street Pentecost right which Mary represented that because she was a carrier of the word but see Jesus wasn't a carrier amen and we're supposed to come to a position in the last days to not be carriers of the word but to be the word not to just talk about the word or even sympathize brother random said with it we are to be the word well all right now that's why that we ended up talking about it we'll drop back a little bit but try to move up where I don't lose you someone click on and don't don't hear what we're saying all right there had to be a prophet sent because where are you going to get Ezekiel in order if a prophet is not to come in the last days remember to Ezekiel what was it son of man prophesy if son of man hadn't spoke to the wind the wind would have blowed bone wouldn't have come to Bone had it not been because of the word of Ezekiel all right what did the prophet is trying to explain you had the Israelites the Jew all right and you had the Samaritan which would Hive to you and I Gentile and Jesus went to both of them you remember the woman at the Wells he was a Samaritan but he never carried the Messiah Ministry to the Gentiles now come on get your Bible and read it show me where he did so he never went the prophet said to the Gentiles that Peter opened the door to the Gentiles in the book of Acts yes but never did they receive the Messiah Ministry because that is the ministry of this on a man that's why Jesus was called that see he had the resurrection Ministry he had the Messiah Ministry all right son of man okay then that son of man see could speak and that's what he was doing in John 20. he was speaking to them not breathing you know I don't know what he said because he just blowed now you know what he's saying the Bible said he said receive ye the Holy Ghost all right Ezekiel was told to prophesy but you know what he was told you say what I'm telling you to say right right and he prophesied under the wind and attack you know it wouldn't have come that's the restoration of Israel right Ezekiel the Valley of the dry bones Israel will be restored one day back to the position they're supposed to be but they will never get to come back into sonship as the bride of Christ he is that will come back in as servants to the bride but they receive the same message that we do which is this message but it'll be through two prophets to them there won't be just this Prophet taken over to Israel and they get converted they they don't go with it they go with a live Ministry remember it would have been very dangerous had he went to Israel with a mosaic sign that he had because that Israelite was trained to believe that and see that's why he didn't get to go wrong people all right but see here in the end time he was to be to you and I his whole message that's what I I love the message see to me the message is the voice of God speaking to you and I why don't you listen to the message like that you might get encouraged to listen sometime you got plenty of time to do everything else oh whatever I just brother Dale I just don't have a time like you we used to listen to tape so much until the neighbors kids would be up playing one of them was saying here a while back talking away he said yep I used to be up there said we'd be in there playing I said they'd be in there have a tape playing they'd be the kids would be in the other room playing we'd be playing a tape now I'm not to the point of saying you got to play them 24 hours a day there's people that do that brother used to come here a good bit I won't call his name but they said that's the way they done one of the brothers in the family you know what they played tapes 24 hours a day in their home that's all right I ain't saying a word about it I'm just saying you don't have to do it that way but you ought to know more about that and your kids ought to know about Jesus Christ and brother Branham instead of the world and all that's on TVs and all this on videos and all its own other things they ought to know more about that than they do about those things all right and we're responsible remember what we let them little Minds listen to is our responsibility all right but you see if you see it that way you'll see one God had to send us a prophet amen see there had to be a prophet sitting the last day because it see that's why I brought around him then he could come with the son of man part speaking and how the resurrection Ministry the discernments the gifts the signs and wonders would work in a man's life why because he was coming back as to be what a son of man that the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ was coming down and speaking through him to you and I amen why wouldn't you want to hear your husband speaking to you right you don't think about the message like that that's my God that's my husband I ain't talking about the the man that divorce is being used I'm talking about the word he's bringing remember it ain't you talking about it's the word that's being brought unto us why wouldn't we be concerned with hearing what our husband would have to say maybe we don't care that much about the husband okay put it in there and forget it but listen see if it had not have been trying to back up a little this morning but yet moving on just a little bit into the thought the Lord Jesus went to the Jews and went to the Samaritans but he didn't go to the Gentiles all right that would be left until the last days to where God would come in the last days and bring the message to you and I now if it's true what I've tried to emphasize all the since I heard the message that I don't believe anybody's ever been born again and didn't hear the word first now if you show me how you can do that then I'll just quit preaching because ain't no need of it Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by what I want a red and Playboy I played I mean I read I I read the news and I read that and you know I really got a revelation from Reading there I'm sure you did you might not want to tell nobody what it is because it might be embarrassing right but what about it if the new birth is the birth of the word why wouldn't we want to hear the word why would we not be interested in hearing the word because to me that's God breathing unto you and I am if you understand the emphasis I'm trying to make instead of the I'm talking about a message that we hear right not just a wind blowing but that's all everybody can do they don't want to talk about the message go you know that brother Branham on so and so and so and so so and so everybody tell you that to the letter can't you where brother random was standing the wind was blowing his pants was moving the curtains was moving I believe in that thank God I believe in it but where did that convert anybody but you don't want to hear about well I I know what the new birth is well that's what you're doing you're waiting on some kind of moving of the Wind you're waiting on some sign or some wonder that you can put it on and say that's my evidence and brother Dale Tires away every one of them by preaching that it's just the opening of the word it's not to shout and it's not the crime it's not the those are After Effects I've never done away with none of that I believe in those emotional things but put Christ first and then the emotions come second may I quote brother random don't jump too high but you can't walk straight when you come down right that's right so what is it then Jesus said receive ye the Holy Ghost but they didn't get it right there they had to wait to The Upper Room experience came which now let me put it this way you remember he was seen as the Bible said of over 500 Brethren acts of Resurrection but 120 dogs made it up a room 380 didn't make it so evidently 380 didn't hold on to the word right yet they seen the great things and I'm not going to say they didn't have their understanding open of the word as to who they were I mean who he was gonna see one of these days the Jews their understanding going to be open that's right to who this Messiah really is you know they're going to see the Christ then they're going to know the word of God of the Old Testament is right and the New Testament is perfect to bring that same Christ to them in the way it would come all right as I said this morning not that we're going to take this message over there you know look this message has been in Israel since back in the 60s brother Perry green and then was in the the you know this this Brothers you know I'm not throwing those stones I'm just saying like it is all right the brothers that came here said there ain't no message Church in Israel anyone over there and starting one well thank God all right but brother Perry green and him had this message on the news media with pictures of brother branham's the fire and what he was saying about Israel back in the 60s or 70s right in there at one time were head of the uh some kind of a dry good something or material under this the people that went from Tucson over there it was a great group of people over there right you're Brother Ray he's been around long enough to know it they were over there they know this message one thing I appreciate about what that that uh Rabbi Richmond either said it or the the guy that was in Israel with one or the other I'm thinking it was the God but he said we put the Bible on the desk of the children you're probably said and said we teach them from your Bible in the United States you can't even bring a Bible to school I know I'm still too old and too sad I know I still say when they bombed that Tower and the next day they had all them great big senators and great big Gods wanted to make themselves look something standing out in front of the Temple of the temp temple Australia what else or which one it was and they were singing and praying the order arrested every one of them bro why they broke the law they were the ones that said we can't pray in school nor everyone been arrested I know I don't sit too good that's all right would you tell me if that ain't true but listen Church can you see why we had to have a prophet it wasn't just that we well we believe in a prophet coming you know well what do y'all believe different to us well we believe this we all just believe a prophet comes I don't believe a prophet just come listen to what I'm saying I believe God sent a prophet I believe that's Ezekiel I believe that's all of it all of that Bible spoke that there'd be a man coming in last days they would have the word of God it wouldn't make the man nothing it didn't make Moses anything because of what he done and things but the word would never been brought to us Gentiles what do you mean brother we had the Bible we've had the Bible and and you talk like that we don't have nothing they never said that why would you come up with that idea I believe it Luther's justification I believe in Wesley's sanctification the truth of it now I believe it in baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in the Methodist the Presbyterian the one that says neptunus isn't the fourness isn't I believe all of them had word don't deny any of them you better remember that the church from the start out of the of the day of Pentecost was a Catholic Church oh it was yeah because it was a universal the word back dire was Catholic meant Universal he didn't mean Roman it became Roman later it was Universal it's what your Prophet saying now he said they say well the Catholic church was written he said that's exactly right I'm an original Catholic but oh no we don't like that talking do we but listen he opened the understanding of their scriptures so that they would have something that the Holy Ghost could come upon maybe that's where the 380 didn't make it maybe they're understanding I said well I go I ain't said it they didn't do it but I ain't saying they did so maybe they didn't get their understanding open you know sometimes somebody has to talk to you a little bit about it to get your understanding open and then God can reveal it but what about trying to open understanding of mankind to us instead of the word of God maybe that's enough backup to get you to understand what I'm meaning to the fact that Ezekiel is saying to Israel the same as it is in John it is in Luke it is in the Bible that he would open an understanding of their scriptures to them and then he would send the Holy Ghost upon them and that would start the church in every new birth ever since then would have to come from the word being planted first and the Holy Spirit quickening the word or making it alive all right and that would make every Church age with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that would make every individual with the same what we've all got this thing what was I emphasizing there the other day we've all got the same evidence no matter what age you see and where it is it's got the same evidence what's going to be the evidence of the Holy Ghost to Israel same thing whether the spirit of God in you agrees with the word right that's the same evidence everybody gets the same all right now but has our has our man I'm trying to get a point now to watch and then we'll move up as our understanding of the scriptures been opened enough until God could speak to us and our understanding been opened enough that we could receive a message from God now what if you're trinitarian sitting out under a tree and all you've ever been taught is trinitarianism all you ever believed was three gods and things and God dropped down and he said I'm one my name's one well now you wouldn't understand what he's talking about right you'd probably accuse it as being the devil that was talking to you right because you'd say I don't understand that so if nothing else to do at Lula Georgia I have tried for 50 years almost to our understanding to be open of the scriptures because that's all I can do I cannot give you the Holy Ghost random couldn't give you the Holy Ghost and Jesus said even my own life didn't reveal it it takes a holy ghost to reveal the word but if I can be the one to be used to plant the seed all right that's between you and God okay now what have we dealt on I'm trying to tie something together the word will come out in a minute in the way you'll see it what have we been trying to talk about not that man has a soul but that's what he is a being he's a person that's the real you it's the soul that's within you we're not true with all of that but we'll you know we'll keep on moving and that Soul within you according to the prophet on the message oh souls in prison paragraph 36 which is number nine if they want to get to it and pull that up I mean excuse me number eight number eight and we're gonna pull that up before we do seven because I had to move the message a little and what does he say okay there's where you know he's talking about how that it wasn't the body died with it and the nature of your spirit is dead and the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world okay now watch anything begin has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin in your life did begin when you were born what when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living Soul then you begin then right so whenever babies born see up here he's defining the other here he's defining that sure in your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the Breath of Life every baby's ever born in the world had to have the Breath of Life breathing into their nostrils right that's why there's a lot stillborns why you think God don't know do you think their souls setting up in cubby holes somewhere that didn't get to be delivered Down to Earth because God forgot about some a stillborn baby that's not no no life it's when it's born don't you think God knew yet there's a life there yet there's wiggling muscles there's all kind of things taking place don't you think God knows whether that soul is going to receive life or not so when you're naturally born he breathes the breath of life into your nostrils and you become a living soul I can even show you and I believe it where brother Branham says that you become a living Soul at the age of accountability see I try to study a lot of things but I try not to bring so much because I know that I bring a whole lot and I get you confused and reading into right around and said when you reach the age of accountability then it's when you become a living soul you know why you have just raised up to a point to your accountable then before then you were a living soul as a baby but not held accountable all right you don't have to wait at the end he ain't explaining you got to wait till then become a living soul he's just expressing it that that you know to me that when you come up to that age of accountability then you start being responsible for the things of life and the doings and you're becoming into a living stage accountable to God through your own life huh we see you become a living soul when you're born into the world but see remember now Adam was a little different because Adam received eternal life when he breathed into his nostrils and he become a living Soul he had an eternal life we don't get eternal life when he breathes into our nostrils as a baby now let me say if I can find it it's on anointed one at the end time or in north at not where he says that our life is permitted of God permitted all right God permitted our life to come because of the Fallen conditions so he permits every baby that's in the world their life to come into them as a living soul there was a lot of bit a lot of difference about Adam because Adam started off full grown and fully doings and all in it and then God breathed into his nostrils and he become an eternal person with God because he breathed into him eternal life let's take a few quotes because I want to get this to be able to do it go back to number seven now which is uh should be paragraph 184 through 187 of blasphemius names all right now here are your Jehovah Witness in their book it says it's a breath that you breathe it's a soul now he's explaining that he doesn't agree with that the breath you breathe all right now to express the difference of word that you'll see he's explaining it is what I said this morning and say it again why is not words coming off of my vocal cords because I'm just breathing but by being a soul within me that's not within the animal I can use my vocal cords to form words because remember sinner or Saint we're in the image of God right so we can use our vocal cords to talk to one another Communications all right so watch what he's saying now see the breath that you breathe is not soul till you understand the breath you breathe is not the soul soul Jesus didn't go he spoke to him he spoke from his inner being out to bring the word to them follow him now in your your time your see if you've done that then uh time you'd be one kind of a soul next time you'd be somebody else see we'd be breathing every time I'd breathe out you breathe in my soul will be going to you and yours and me no that's not it get it straight that's not the way it goes next time you're somebody else let's breathe that soul look where you'd be now the breath is wind and wind is what you breathe into your nostrils now they take the scripture from back and God breathed breath into the nostrils and he became a living Soul now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of a breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of life into him see what kind of a breath he was a breathing living man well then if that be so then every animal is a living Soul because they breathe the human soul and our soul and all together then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient see so brother the argument don't stand but what get did God did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he became a living Soul who into Adam right a soul that can't die now I've explained we don't all get that now that was him but Jesus got it Adam got it coach Adam is the first Adam and Jesus is the second Adam the first Adam was the living Soul the second Adam was The Lord Of Glory that's the scripture all right so Jesus when he was born he just didn't get a natural life he would hit that soul that came into him was eternal life all right so it with Adam then he become a living Soul a soul that can't die now watch we're going to get into honey Plum to our elbows notice breathe the breath of life into his nostrils and he become an eternal Soul because God breathed not what nature done so he now what's he defining nature is what brings life into you all right comes from God with his nature but what God did breathe the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul you said what Adam died but remember Adam had a redeemer because already in his nostrils had become the breath of Eternal of the Eternal God how could Adam be lost and you become a living Soul he was the son of God not his breath as the African word I don't know what the Greek word for it is right now but the African word they call it a Moya which means the wind an unseen Force animals breathe the more your Sinners breathe the more you then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul breathe into us by breath why would you struggle for eternal life it backs first brother it just don't do but God especially upon Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power With God all right now he breathed into Adam eternal life all right he breathed into Jesus Christ eternal life but the rest of us all come natural-born people with the Breath of Life permitted of God to come that we would be alive and be a living soul but then when you're born again he breathes the breath of eternal life into your soul right and you become an eternal person with God right born by the Breath of God all right what about it look at number nine paragraph 235-237 the blasphemus 9. let me let me read 234 I forgot to pull this one off and have it somewhere all right now I didn't give him this so we'll wait till we get down to it but it'll tie us together paragraph 232 we're jumping to 235 so remember that if they want to roll it backwards I don't know how where they can handle that but watch right around and says church is the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God oh did you get it congregation says amen the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathes breath into the nostril spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul did you know the Pentecostals are the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God it's the only day of Pentecost is the Breath of God breathe into the soul of those people all right bring it on down see where it now what is it Church born to the Breath of God now watch him he's going all the way till he takes it all the way up the pyramid when this stature was molded itself up there in condition God breathed breathed breaths upon them receive ye the Holy Ghost then you're a Son of God now watch him you could join anything you want to then well I've had people throw that in my mouth I mean my faith well the rest said you can join any church you want to you ain't never had nobody to throw that at you right around and said you go anywhere you want to I said right exactly right agree with what he said but you just don't know the rest of what he's saying he said what's the rest what he said let's what he said was you just let your light shine and said they'll throw you out so go anywhere you want to in this message today let alone a denominations go anywhere you where you want to would just let your light shine and you're going to be excommunicated so we don't worry about the quotes right but what's he making the statement he's not saying you can join anything you want to right he's telling you that you ain't going to want to join nothing else is that to what he's saying well you won't join something for her I was born into the family then you are a son of God see when this stature is molded up so he's doing the same thing here that I've done with you take the new birth here preach it come up here to The Headstone and preach about the new birth you see what he's doing the new birth come on a dead Pentecost Peter and them wrote in this word the Breath of God and it was put in letter form right right but remember the prophet said The Headstone didn't come back to her I've had that argument by a lot of people too in the message what do you mean headstone didn't come I mean just what the prophet said he said The Headstone didn't come back there why there was no church molded into a place where it could be done the closest was was the day of Pentecost but immediately they started falling down and I know I've had them here to argue with me about it but around said the real true bride even went to nicaea I've had them to argue with me hear about that about I said the true bride didn't go according to brother Randleman says it to you they said no the true bride stayed away well that one what the prophet said now I'm sorry the prophet said the true bride went down to was there on Azusa Street I mean they're on excuse me their own nicaea and I know the rest of the quotes that goes with it because when they saw that they would write they left 325 A.D when the true bride seen that they wouldn't write I know the rest of the message they left and I see her I agree they left I see you but now they don't listen to the rest of the words that he said but they picked up the doctrine and wrote it out with them there were no argument at nazia 325 A.D over whether there was one God or three Gods there was no argument about that read it to me I want you to read me the history I've read it it's reading a no the argument was whether or not Jesus was God or a like substance that was the Aries and at the finale ever who the two guys there's two names are that they argued it one of them believed that Jesus was almighty God true God the same substance the other one believed that he was a like substance which made it a demon god a second God and if you will get the original nician Creed and read it the original niceean Creed says we believe in one true and living God and Jesus as the very person see I've read them things but how many people so and so said it wasn't well go get the book and read it read the original and I see and Creed because at that time they were still good people but that guy with a big old name he had planted his seed that it took 300 years that many many more um meetings but by 606 he had already planted his inroad so much until they come out with come out with it and started bringing out the trinitarian idea and isn't it amazing that what they started back there was that Jesus was an alike substance isn't it amazing the day that the split in the message right now is what the biggest split that's come over all of these years has been what Jesus wasn't God he was a light God he's the son of God but I'd agree with that if you know what you're talking about because me a Son of God is God made manifest in another form but that ain't what they're teaching they're teaching that he was just a man until River Jordan did he become God and that left him and he died well then you don't have a savior to die for you you see why I holler at those things so much because it won't work and you don't want it I don't like it that way and I always tell you that I try it with my new birth to see if it's right or not because my new birth go all the way back to to The Upper Room and believe in the same God all the way down now if you change God's in between her there's something wrong with your new birth it's not original I want mine to be a regional I want it to stay with the truth but look what the prophet was bringing he said after this is molded up into this when that headstone comes it'll come because somebody brought us the word now I'm going to tell you what I've said all these years and not emphasize it a whole lot I'm not looking for a headstone to come I'm looking for a manifestation yes a quickening yes a baptism to fill every fiber of our being yes but this message is the headstone if not you got to have another Prophet to come speak to us that's right now do you understand where I stand if this message is not the Breath of God being breathed upon the Bride of Jesus Christ through what the prophet has brought us from God himself then you've got to have another Prophet to the Gentiles that's right so I guess that's what all these preachers want they want to be that one because they're real quick to straighten out this one aren't they the ones that brought us into the message I'm not talking just here I'm talking to an example the ones that started us brought us into the message taught us the message now they've turned against the message we'll see if you turn against the message you got to have another Prophet to come because come on if the church is born by the of God if on the day of Pentecost that that Holy Ghost came and quickened the word that the Lord Jesus for three and a half years had planted into them and write it to life to ask for his resurrection he opened their understanding of the scriptures about himself and what was to take place and then the Holy Ghost had somewhere to fall because that's why it took this Prophet you know what he said he said it took him 30 something years to preach the statue of perfect man it's in the book the statue of perfect man and he said he took him 30 something years I can show you if you want to go back to the Intervale 1956 where he was talking about a living moving instrumentality of Jesus Christ walking in you on two feet and using your voice to speak Etc but yet one day it was fully made known because those disciples had that statue of a perfect man up to where it's called Holy Spirit right but they didn't have the headstone well now what's the headstone going to be some other God some other something is it polygamy that's what everybody thinks it what kind of a Doctrine is it is this message this prophet's message never begun in 47. from 47 to 63 was restoring the faith of the same God that had already spoke that Peter and him had spoke he was going back and restoring that to understanding to each one of us go to the Rapture message that's just one he said this message began in the seals all of those years he said was just preparation getting ready to bring his message that's why I differ with the people that said he was wrong before the sea was broken right after him if he was wrong then why did God come and open the seals to him well it opened it doesn't get him straight down oh that's wonderful especially when you think you're the one that tried to straighten him out you see church God had to send us a prophet and his message begun with the opening of the word that was God breathing on us what are you looking for brother Dale in the headstone well nice brother so and so out younger he he's a young guy he's gotten the message well he's got signs and wonders following him I told you and you don't like it out there especially and wrote a random pieced off they had a man picked out that they went to check him out some of the well-known of the message went to check the man out to see if that could be a Reincarnation of another Ministry come on and only one Gentile prophet he brought his message and he passed on he spoke to us he breathed to us the only way we can be born again is to let that message come in with us I'm not talking about born again down here that's fine you can get born again down here in a Baptist Church but you ain't gonna stay there why because if it's the holy ghost that you've got you ain't going to stay there you're going to come out of that and come to the message and search until you find the real message I'm not throwing stones but I ask you a question why a lot of you come here well you think it's the only place they never said that ain't never taught no joke but I do believe we try to stay with the truth at least we've tried all right you show me somewhere else if they got more truth in what we got we'll just shut down and go you don't think I believe that I like to swap places with you for one month and let you be me and let me be you I'd like to see what you turn out to be because of what you have to fight and what you have to do and things to try to bring the truth not arguing about it just telling it like it is amen but you see church I'm not looking for The Headstone to come I forgot that a long time ago how many of you remembers probably 20 30 years ago when I stood right here one day and said I'm not looking for the rapture the order scene is faces I said I thought the Rapture started on death Pentecost you mean they're not going to be in the rapture I thought that Peter or Paul explained it that we were resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I thought Dave was going to be part of the rapture well then we're part of the rapture we just the father man of it that's right I told you I quit looking for the coming of the Lord you remember brother random made this statement he said I'm not looking for his coming I'm saying he's here you remember that well how long has it been 1982 ending up in 83 right about dark close to the sealed when and I preached a message and said I'm not looking for the coming of the Lord I'm saying he's here is that a new thought a new idea A New Concept or something's come up I've taught the new birth ever since I've been in the message Church born by the Breath of God Ezekiel feet to them bones and they'll come forth not the wind that went Blowing by made them live he was the voice of the man that called life in to them or we'll call life into Israel he spoke it back there as a promise somewhat five six thousand years later five years a full year a four thousand it'll finally take place but it'll take place because Ezekiel said it brother random said they will be a rapture now have you ever noticed him saying that I've tried to emphasize that go to the Rapture message and listen to it he said there'll be a Rapture it has been spoken now let it come to pass now what's he meaning could it be that he's saying that without him bringing that message there would have been no possibility of a Rapture ever coming I believe it I believe he spoke it but I believe somebody's got to be it Jesus said receive you the Holy Ghost it was a while before they done it but he wasn't talking about himself because he was a holy ghost but a few days later they received that experience the word he had said to unto them had become alive I thought we believed it said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be revealed as he declared unto his servants the prophets I thought this message was the final message to the final age that we wasn't looking for another message to come we weren't looking for another messenger we would believe in the message but then we've done heard the voice of God that's right why would I want to listen to anything else why would I want to be concerned about anything else in the restoration of the Bride tree I ask you to go read that or listen to it and hear how he talks about how that he breathe that fourth stage which is the word that how he breathes on them but see that's where everybody's looking for something to happen one of these days some bro somebody one of these days you want to hear the voice of God turn on a tape listen to it why would you want to hear anything else why would you want to go after all of the things of of the guys you know like Benny Hinn that can walk right out in midair or has done it well the great things that happened to a lot of the ministry why would you want to go after something like that but why is everybody looking for some new thing that's why I don't look for new things I look back to see and find out what's already been because according to my Bible he's Hebrews 13 8 which means whatever he was he's always been and always will be the same yesterday today and forever are you looking for another message to come brother Dale no sir I'm not looking for another Messenger to come I'm looking at the message this man has brought and he has already breathed upon us God through that man because remember now as I'm closing that it wasn't Ezekiel that was breathing on him right but Ezekiel was prophesying breathing upon them but he was breathing The Word of Promise of these things will take place and it'll be a manifestation this Prophet has already spoken the things and brought it to her that God has used his voice to breathe upon us can I end it by saying one time if the birth of the word is true and I believe it even though the word can be spoken it is no good until the life of the word comes into the word just because brother random brought the message as I said he brought the message Jesus brought the message and Jesus opened their understanding of the message I didn't give him the new birth you see because I believe the prophet he said they'll come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll fill ever fiber of our being and take us into rapture when that stature stands there molded together in the image of God not as just one individual but the entire man body of Christ around the world then God can open our understanding and reveal it to us born by the Breath of God he breathed into Adam and he received eternal life why can't he Breathe Here as this is build up an enemies out why cannot this be him breathing on us to make us eternal to make these old bodies eternal to bring us to a raptured condition you're going to find out when you get there like that it's been your journey the whole time it's been your journey that God has been bringing you through not just to jump up oh we're ready to go look at him well we got it a little boy here it is just settle down and be what you are come on musicians like I told you about a certain incident happened in a church one time and I'm not against shouting I wish everybody would understand the words that I say but those people were coming down that line and they were shouting like everything and those brothers were shaking them and calling over them and crying over them and all but the next night the same people was coming right back by and they was crying and praying over them but I was in the line and I'd just stop them and say well let's just settle down here a minute now and let's get the Lord on our mind you know and what you need and the things and let's pray well I won't call the name that's none of the business but this certain brother was standing there and he kept looking over and he kept watching me and he's saying that the line going from here to there was shouting and stopping but the line from here from where that was at after the stopping it was going that way and they was really rejoicing the next night we were in the prayer line he was standing here and I was standing here and I was listening to him he wasn't screaming and hollering as he did the night before he was talking he said let's just settle down here a little bit and think about what you need because God is the Healer and let's pray and believe that God is the Healer we see you wouldn't listen into what I said you think I'm cold and dry I don't believe in it I said the line from where I was at when it was quickened got to rejoicing because they knew what had happened they were rejoicing over something that had took place the others were rejoicing just because somebody else was there and I'm sorry I believe in shouting I believe in crying and worshiping but I believe sometimes you need to sit down and listen may I quote brother Branham he said a lot of times we're praying on paraphrase it's close but he said we do all the talking he said we need to just sit down and listen and let him talk to us we do all the Talking we don't do listening prior I thought was a communication between us and God I thought he was to speak and we was to hear I didn't know that we were to do all I was listening looking while ago with a quote where he was talking about how that we we do all of the hulking you know we want to tell God how to do things right we want to tell him how to do things well now Lord you needed it no no I asked him Lord I don't tell him Lord you need to heal Brother Gary between me and him I asked him to touch Brother Gary to heal him I asked him to make his word manifest I don't tell him what he needs to do ask him to fulfill his word what about you maybe we need to get to ask him sometime instead of trying to order him to do something well brought it in I've never ordered the Lord to do nothing have you ever just talked and told him said Lord you need to save my family you need to save my kids well you know it's true that's a good but maybe you need to say sometimes Lord I've committed them into your hands for you to do whatever is necessary to bring them in and then when they get sick oh look now what if you loosed him to God and he started dealing with them and let the devil get a hold of him I thought we were supposed to be that we left our hands off yeah but they're dying you mean to tell me you don't know how God can run his business you're trying to tell God how to do his business I've always been this way I've always believed one thing brother Maloney's sister he had seen I mean she had seen me and your situation that happened that most of you here heard me say that when I prayed for sister Maloney I turned around and looked out a window and I knew she'd never be healed I couldn't tell her I couldn't tell him there was no need of it what good would it have done I believe she was assigned I believe she's all right brother Maloney's sister heard that she used to ask me every time I'd go up you heard anything about brother Maloney is he going to live or is he going to die Sister Gone ain't told me well he told you about sister-in-one he told me but he ain't told me nothing on this case I said so I've got to pray for him to be all right and believe he's all right the day he dies call me and tell him he's dead and I'll quit praying but until that takes place I pray for his healing well now she calls Sam Jesse passed on he said all right we quit praying now you don't believe that God can let you go down to the last Split Second and raise you back up I will remind you that in brother Brown's Ministries about seven times the dead was raised so that went on past the last moment didn't it and then he come on the scene let's quit trying to tell God what to do and start talking to him but the best thing to do is thank him for it won't you do that instead of instead of any boots about the kids and start thanking him and say thank you Lord thank you Lord for saving them thank you Lord for saying it gets worse you say Thank You Lord it gets worse than thank you Lord they get sick he say thank you Lord foreign that fits only in a place where you've experienced it yourself understand what do we got 604 wraps if we never meet again and if to God I'll see you the Rapture I'll see you in the Rapture I'll see you at that blessed savior we'll live and Reign forever I'll see you in the Rapture some sweetness now we all know the story but to remind you brother and sister Anderson wanted a child years ago not to more than that on back but they were not able to have a child the Lord had spoke to me about it and I just didn't say nothing because if he tells you what do you I want to be first I want you to know I said that first now that ain't nothing but an exalted Spirit it ain't the Holy Spirit so I just waited he sure would have been good to told them might have but he might have hindered them too brother my brother Forney came and he preached one night and I had told him that they were seeking a child we had discussed that a little bit I didn't tell him the Lord had spoke to me about it I just said we're believing it he walked right down the aisle and walked right up to him and said God's going to give you that child well we got a little picture in office said the child that Faith brought well I believe it there she is little Sarah all right now little Sarah wants a brother or sister amen he said well I don't know where Sabra does or not all right let's see brother and sister Anderson they want another child and they've got plans to go through and doctors again all the time but let's just pray and say I want to give him this prayer cloth for them together to keep unless to believe it and Sarah to believe it right Sarah okay see my little sweetheart she give me sugar you couldn't see her on the camera she's just laughing all right listen they want another child so let's believe it okay well we're not concerned we just praying together they want to church to pray with them about another child all right so let's just commit it to the hands of the Lord and believe it he hasn't spoke to me to tell them that they can have a child they're going to have a child if he tells me I'll tell him but I want to believe the word what they want what they desire right father we hold the hands here of our brother and sister and you know that one time they we're childish yet you gave him a child now they want another child Lord so we just ask you father to come on the scene manifest yourself and touch the bodies to make it whatever that would have to be done or needed and we believe in medical science we thank you for them Lord we do what they say they say take this take that we do it as long as it's not a hindrance to anything wrong we do it that we just commit to our brother and sister to you and they're Desiring a child and we desire with them and by faith we believe that you will give us the answer to what we have need of we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen okay today and catches waiting right away so get ready I'll see you in the Rapture song singing into one another's you're leaving and remember him Lord I'll see you in the rapture I'll see you in the Rapture I are at that meeting
