========================================

good morning boys and girls morning you're on God's time okay today we're going to talk about parenting so take one of these and pass it around y this is the first thing when brother W asked me teach Sunday school this is the first thing that came to mind I prayed and ask the Lord to lead me I had studied on other things because I knew eventually my time might come so had other things more kind of prepared but this this is what the Lord I think laid on my heart to talk about not parenting so much our children but God parenting us about yous like it should have a few extra I think yeah we could we used to but it is on okay well what I started thinking about was like I said how that God is our parent and the way that we parent our children you can see and think about and understand how God Parents us can everybody hear me yes okay I've got this microphone on but it's not boosting me at all I'm I'm okay don't get low just stay up can um let's open with a word of prayer our heavenly father we thank you for the opportunity to gather today in Your Name Lord and we pray that everything that is said and done today during the service and during the Sunday schools that have all be For Your Glory and Honor we pray just unfold your word to us Lord give us understanding of you and just help me to step aside and allow you to speak what you've uh given me through me Lord just use my lips I praying we love you and thank you for all your many blessings and thank you that you are our father and for the realization of that in Jesus name amen all right starting with number one on our on my notes God is our father we all know that God is the father or progenitor of all mankind but especially of we who are born again now that's that statement I'm what I'm saying is that God by creation you know he created all of us so we're all his children in that respect but specifically when we're born again we begin to know God as our father and I did I couldn't find any scriptures or quotes to back that up I'm just saying that by creation you know we are all the children of God so uh Part B scripture tells us that things of God can be understood by the things that we see Romans 1:20 y'all don't have to turn that I'll just read itang second okay for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse so we see the creation is a reflection of the Creator and in this case you know we see God in nature we see God in the pyramids and we see him in the Zodiac when God when from Elohim came out the logos and brother Bram said he saw the logos as or you could uh picture him as being you know like a child playing before the father's doorstep he began creating began unfolding and everything he made is just a reflection of him and so that we can see him so we have some understanding of what he is and I think that's why God put us here in these relationships that we're in in marriage and in uh fatherhood and you know parenting so that we can see a reflection of God by those things we can understand why he does what he does by me having kids now I can understand why God does the things he does to me does that make sense okay and God helps us to see him I skipped one one part here I'm going to go back to number one to elaborate on God as our father we know that God as Elohim he desired to have a family he wanted to condescend and wanted to be understood he wanted to be worshiped and he wanted to uh to have a family uh God's provider approach to Divine Fellowship 1966 brother bam said God loves to fellowship with his creature in the Garden of Eden we are told that when a man walked in the uprightness of God God came down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with his children Adam and Eve he came down and fellowship with them I think of when I'm at work I'm all the time thinking about my children I can't wait to get home and fellowship with them and anytime I'm feeling lonely I'm alone 80% of the day you know driving and when I feel lonely I just start thinking about my kids or my wife and just the you know their little mannerisms and the cute things they do and it just cheers me up I think God was that way before the world he he saw us he knew what we would be before he created us and he desired to have fellowship with us he wanted to bring bring us into full manifestation so he could have fellowship with us uh so again I'll say uh Part B there I'll finish reading that when we understand God attributes better when we observe our relationships and life and like I mentioned briefly marriage me being a husband now when I look at my wife I can see how God will look at his bride and how God desired before he you know before I had a bride I desired to have a bride I was lonely I wanted a companion and I can see how God will do all that he does all that he has done to get a bride you know he'll go to just any measure to get a bride and how that um and then she just the opposite she can see she's a bride she can see how that God uh longs to or how that a bride would long to have a a bridegroom to fellowship with and to and to protect her and provide for and care for and all those things so we see these relationships we see that little piece of God we can understand a little bit better that part of God number two good parenting techniques now these are just four things a b c and d those are four things that I thought of that I've seen in my experience and both uh being raised as a child and then and then raising children and then more importantly my spiritual walk and being raised as a child of God I see these things that these four things now these were not all the things I mean and at the end we'll have a group discussion and y'all can mention some more of these if y'all can think of any but these are four ones that I've thought of just from my own experience and I don't have a lot of scriptures to back up some of these it's nothing more than just my experience coming in to be born again coming into the bride or into the body our day nourishing when a baby is born we parents nourish him by feeding him clothing him and providing for him in every way he may need it we quote unquote baby him during this time in his life okay so in a sense God also does this for newborn babies in Christ he pours out blessings we nearly can't contain fills us with the Holy Spirit clothes us with his righteousness reveals truths to us one after another Etc and again that was my experience when I came to the message um most of you know my story I was going to North Hall High School I was a Baptist raise a Baptist and um uh Sister Amy brother Joe's daughter uh she and I crossed paths and she and I dated for a while and she came to church with me at Corinth Baptist Church in Gainesville for a while couple of times I mean and then after a while uh she she said well now I'll come to church with you why can't you come to church with me so I said okay well I mean I really didn't want to I was really hesitant to but at some point along the way uh I think it was uh that meeting that brother jail hosted in 2002 brother a bisc preach there some of yall remember that that was my first time in a message service I came to that because I thought well it's outside of the church you know and I was afraid to come here I thought everybody's just going to surround me and and you know uh indoctrinate me and I just I didn't want to be surrounded that way so I mean I'd be outnumbered so I thought well gean Mountain Center nice open place I can get out whatever you know so well I'm more comfortable in that environment so I went there and I was amazed and what I saw I mean people standing up shouting and Amen brother and right up under the preacher yelling at the preacher I thought what are y'all doing I was like brother man this is a good church man so uh he first saw things like that but eventually though because I saw everything was kind of okay yall are all pretty tame I said well I'll start coming to church there for a little while and see and the Lord began to catch me catch my attention and get a hold of and it began to show me things and from there it started just one thing after another for the first few years I guess it was just constantly unfolding things you know and the simple things the milk of the word the one God water baptism and all these really simplistic things that well now we look at as simple but back then I was just appalled and I said Lord this is amazing and where was I when I was reading my Bible before as a Baptist I was reading my Bible every day as a 15-year-old Baptist kid up till I was 17 at this time I read over these things over and over again never saw and and the serpent seed and all those things so for a while when we come to the New Birth God babies us and he keeps Ching Little Things to just you know help us to grow but just it's just milk it's just simple things we can't handle the strong meat work and then really can't contain oh let's see now Part B training as he gets older a child is weaned from the breast and given solid food he begins to take on more responsibility and becomes more independent begins to learn the word no you're not told that as an infant and it seems like to me when I came into the message you know everything when I was a baby in Christ everything I asked for seemed like God gave it to me you know for a time there it seemed like just constantly uh the answer was yes or the answer was you know he was always just giving me these things and revealing the word to me one thing after another but at some point when you mature you have to start to learn the word no God answer sometimes is no when we reach this stage as Christians we begin to eat more strong meat of the word and many of the blessings of God that want flutter Our Lives seem to cease God no longer babies us he wants us to become mature adult Christians seasoned in the gospel so I guess I'll go ahead and read a few of these notes here now this is a question I've asked about in the Bible study some of yall this last Bible study I I asked brother Dell I pretty well knew what his answer was going to be I just kind of wanted to get some more insight and maybe understanding about why is it that for that short few first few years y'all remember I had a ton of questions you know for the first few years coming into the message I I just asked one after another 10 questions at every Bible study and now I study more than I did then and I don't have many questions and it's not because I know everything it's just I think what's happening is then I was getting the milk of the work and just you know little things here and there just constantly left and right Revelation but now getting into more strong me it takes a while to chew you know sometimes things come Progressive and slow and it just seems almost like you're just dried up but really you're making yourself available to God you're praying reading your Bible and studying listening to sermons come to church and making yourself totally available but yet where's the blessings that want to flow well that's one thing I can say is that uh maybe I'm not getting the milk of the work now I'm getting strong meat and it comes slowly and progressively that's how brother Dale brings it slow in progression and that's the way we need it as as we're maturing so uh in separation from unbelief uh 5502 28 brother Bram said sometimes God gives you trials did you ever know that give you some child training or get you all fixed up sometimes like that just to see what you'll do about it and then Jehovah Gyra 57039 in the evening how God loves to test his people these aren't on yall SNES by the way this is something how God loves to test his people every child that comes to God must be tested child trained no exceptions everyone so there's no excuses that we all have to face that we all have to go through child training and maybe tonight you're sick oh excuse me and maybe tonight that you're sick in other words he's saying the reason you're sick maybe is just to have a little child training just a little testing don't be discouraged God's on the throne he knows all things if we're truly born of the spirit of God everything's working together for our good he's going to make everything right he promised he would he swore he would and he's got to keep that word he's kept it now for thousands of years on to every believer would you be be an exception no sir we're no exception now watch him now okay y'all can go ahead and turn to Hebrews 5 and just stay there I guess through the rest of the Sunday school I'll have so I'll have other scriptures to read but just a verse here and there so just stay on Hebrews 5 and while you're turning there uh you must be born again 61 12:31 the morning service what do you do where a baby as soon as it's born wash him is that right and as soon as a man has DED has died to himself and is born of God he's Washed by the Water of the word amen if it says Jesus name you say Jesus name says You must be born again you say the same thing every what God says you're washed by that water of the word amen now you're ready now for life you're ready to be started out now now you're born a new born in the family of God with a new parent that's what we're talking about parenting you you can't be born without having a parent so if you're born in the Brotherhood of a church that's what you got if you're born in a Creed there you are but if you're born in God conceived in his word you got a new parent that's God ready to make his word known Among Us with you speak it through you oh a new parent that parent is God he's ready to take his word now that he's already spoke and lay it in you and make it come to life see now you have your training now you're ready you're ready to go into training now child training that's the hard part when you think you ought to do this and the word Cuts you around and shows you something else why they believe that over that don't make any difference what they believe here's what God said you must be about the father's business now you're getting born again now you're getting right getting straightened out you have a new parent okay I'm going to read Proverbs 22:6 but stay on Hebrews right now we all know it is train up a child in the way he should go when he is old he'll not depart from it now my child training early on as a Baptist uh my mom and dad never really I don't remember them ever sitting me down and praying with me and reading we did do Family Bible readings but I don't think they ever really pray with me at night and things but my grandma my dad's mom she's always stood out of my mind because she sat down with me and my sister she'd have us each Pi a Bible story we'd read it every night we'd pray and like Dave Ramsey says more is caught than taught does that make sense in other words you teach your kids to read their Bible but if you don't they'll do what you do they will do what you say you know so more caught than taught so I would see my grandma read and pray in addition to her praying with us and that stuck with me and several years later I went astray from it this was when I was four or five but she did this with us and then 7 8 9 10 11 around there I I strayed from it for a while I didn't read my Bible today as a little kid of course but then around 12 13 years old I began to want to know more about God and I started reading my Bible and praying so see you train up a child and God does the same with us in our early Christian experience he trains us up and he and and the way to go so that we will not depart from it and uh Hebrews 57 uh who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications was strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death and was heard and that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered you know God in flesh learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him and then skip down to verse 12 for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belong to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil okay and then just I guess continue to stay on Hebrews I think I've got yeah I've got another turn to Hebrews 12 if you want to turn there I'm going to read another scripture uh from James chapter 4 this is back in reference to God telling us no again um you lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask a this that you may consume it upon your dust sometimes I think when we ask God for things and the answer is no we just don't want to take that we think either well it's I think the devil tells us this he tells me anyway that well I must have not had enough Faith well no the answer just might be no you know sometimes we just have to accept that when we ask God for things sometimes the answer is no and we just have to live with it so and it could be that we're asking them is we're asking maybe for the wrong thing okay so now part C down to chasing on your notes the most difficult part of parenting for both the parent and the child is chastening the child often does not understand why he has to be punished and he may feel betrayed or unloved by the parent however just the opposite is true we actually chasen our children out of love that's the reason we do it good parents must chasen their children or they will never learn to be obedient and disciplined God Chas chastens every child that comes to him he rebukes us and chastens us out of love now stay on Hebrews 12 but I'm going to read something else here Proverbs 23 withhold not correction from the child if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell he that uh Proverbs 13:24 he that speaketh excuse me he that spareth his Rod hateth his son but he that loveth him Chase him the time and Proverbs 22:15 foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of Correction shall drive it far from you now Hebrews 12 verse 5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and sorth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye without chastisement where of all are partakers uh then are all bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather in be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verely for a few days Chas us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present time seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward it yith the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby okay and then Part D leading throughout his entire childhood a child must be led he lacks experience and if not directed by a parent he will go astray in the same way we must be directed by God for our adversary's entire purpose is to see that we go astray thankfully God is Sovereign and all powerful and he knows how to lead us along okay y'all can turn to this one if you want to U oh no I'm sorry it's just one verse Psalm 37:23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way and then Psalm 9111 for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against the stone okay uh let's see and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies uh 1961 to 12 in the evening and they let's see but you know it sometimes God lets it get that way to try you you can never Abraham would have never possessed the Gate of the enemy until he was tried first and you'll never possess the Gate of the enemy until you go through the trials some through the water some through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood God leads his children see you must be first tried oh then the illegitimate falls in the trial but the true child of God stands true he knows where possession lays he knows where he's standing he knows what's happened to him he knows that he's pass from Death unto life and he knows that God answers prayer and then uh God hiding himself in Simplicity and 1963 or 3:17 in the morning is uh because that man was was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself a man was made to rely completely upon God as the reason we're liking un to Lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit's supposed to lead us so man is made that way and God made all of his works so simple that the simple could understand it and God makes himself simple with the simple in order to be understood by the simple okay all right and I wanted to read these verses of this song Let's see you're in a whole another dimension I guess teaching Sunday school cuz time FES uh I'll just read this real quick God leads us along everybody knows this song in Shady Green pasture so rich and so sweet God leads his dear Children Al where the waters cool flow leads the wees wey ones be God leads his dear Children Al sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright God leads his dear children along sometimes in the valley and darkest of night God leads his dear children alone through sorrow though Sorrows befall us and Satan oppose God leads his dear children alone through Grace we can conquer defeat all our foes God leads his dear children along away from the m and away from the clay God leads us their children alone away up in glory eternity's day God leads us their children alone some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood some through great sorrow but God gives us s in the night season and all the day long if you ever heard me sing you know why I didn't sing that I just wanted to read it because it kept going through my mind as I Was preparing this message about parenting God leads us we're his children and quickly number three the group discussion what experiences in your life can you think of where God expressed his fatherhood attribute to you if you have another one to add to these four that I thought of or and I'll say this as an example this is kind of what I'm looking for back when I played rock and roll music I was a drummer in a rock band and uh obviously rock and roll music we know was wrong well I didn't know that I thought it was really pleasing to the Lord because we were playing Christian rock so brother Aaron preached Christian rock is a Croc and I thought well I I didn't like brother Aon during that time and but the Lord began to convict me and one day uh I was convicted this is just shortly after I started coming here I wasn't coming here very long and was still playing with that rock band and the Lord convicted me and I stopped right in the middle of her performance and walked backstage I said I I can't do this anymore all the band came out there with me and I said I just it was only in front of five or 10 people it wasn't a big deal but uh that's the last ever played with but what happened is God chastised me he convicted me at first and said just put it down and I he knew I was too young to understand it just like I do with Ula we don't let her play with the electrical socket we know she'll get hurt she she wants to play with the electrical socket though so we just stop her and years to come she'll learn why it was wrong and years later I began to understand that there's a lustful demon associated with rock and roll music and many other wrong things associated with it so now I see what's wrong but at the time God just told me leave it alone so and I had to listen so uh does anybody have a something to add that something in your own experience where you've seen God expressed as a father Yes um I think protection from danger specifically protection from danger it was soon after I uh I I I had turned to the Lord and Tom and I were driving on 120 from marett to Rosell and a pickup truck on the other side of the road hit a concrete bridge Rail and a chunk of that came into Tomas radiator and 3 in above that would have been in his neck you know the truck somehow I didn't see it went over our car as we went under it and he slid along the right hand side and turned over in the creek but it didn't hit us at all and I when I after I after it all happened I realized Satan was trying to destroy me right there because he had his gun stained against someone coming to the Lord yeah and um it was his his absolute protection that kept us all alive yeah God's obligated to his children he protects us because we're his children so anybody else just like we give everything that TR our kid that they need God suppli all our needs all our wants and he protect she saying I mean I drive all the time Jack KN on getting on 85 285 and I bar had KN room please by so yeah little things that he does for us sometimes we don't thank him but we just thank him for everything that he does for us exactly reminds me of that brother brother Brenham said you fought your way here in church and when he was asked that was nothing I mean he just drove to church and he didn't see what would have taken place God protected him I got rear ended twice on the highway coming to church and and no not today but I mean when I was living in Atlanta and I was coming to church and got rear rended twice and got out of my car and there's not a a m a mark on I mean you know and I called on and I said well I'm probably going to be L I just got reared and I was just shaking and and I get I I'm in the media and in that little Aspire that you read and I thought oh my God you know it's got to be bashed in I get out and walk to the back of the car and not a scratch on the bumper and me the car hit me and knocked me into the Medan so I was like okay and so I cracked it up and car stopped and let me back on the highway and I made Church all time it was just like no I could believe it we have nothing to be afraid of cuz God's angels are always prot us we need to remember that with coming don't forget your camera fire did just hit stop on that thing over there
