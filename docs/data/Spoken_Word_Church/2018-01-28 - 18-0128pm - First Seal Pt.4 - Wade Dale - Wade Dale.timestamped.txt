[32:59] I'll be going to the Philippines Lewis
[33:02] and Christine I'm not going to be able
[33:03] to go been in prayer for the past week
[33:07] and I just really never felt comfortable
[33:10] with it's not that I don't feel
[33:12] comfortable with Jim going with me but
[33:14] I've just never felt comfortable with
[33:16] her going over there with me and taking
[33:19] that much of the money out because
[33:21] there's a brother already paid for her
[33:22] ticket to go the the money was there but
[33:26] but we're going to leave her here and
[33:28] and I've got a two-week agenda that's
[33:32] pretty full so I don't want to be
[33:34] dragging her around but I've been
[33:35] praying all week and finally I think
[33:37] Wednesday night the Lord spoke to him
[33:38] and told me that that she needs to stay
[33:40] here at this time so I hate that but
[33:43] they'll fit the Lord's will I want her
[33:45] to stay here and in that way he won't
[33:47] have to it's a rough trip 20 something
[33:50] mile flight two weeks not knowing you
[33:53] know I mean she'd be just as home with
[33:55] anywhere else but still traveling and
[33:57] all those things like that so so just
[33:58] keeps any prayers I'll be the only ones
[34:00] going now so well but we do have an
[34:02] agenda brother royal sent me a message
[34:04] that they're already there at Mount
[34:07] Pinatubo doing a mission work they're
[34:10] saying now that the church is going to
[34:13] have to be bigger because they already
[34:14] have over a hundred people wanting to
[34:16] accept the message and be baptized so
[34:18] where they're going to try to raise some
[34:21] more funds about another two or three
[34:23] thousand dollars to finish the building
[34:25] but a structure will be thin
[34:26] by March the 31st so we'll be able to go
[34:29] and dedicate it so dedicate it for you
[34:31] guys because um the funds all come from
[34:34] you but if you got anything else that
[34:36] you want to give feel free to give it a
[34:40] sister release or myself whichever way
[34:41] you want to do it so let's go to the
[34:43] Lord in prayer revelation 6 verse 1 and
[34:47] 2
[34:48] definitely father we thank you for this
[34:50] day Lord that we can gather enough house
[34:54] where it's comfortable and we have a
[34:57] roof over a head Lord we think many
[35:00] times of the people in the early ages
[35:02] that met in homes and stables and closed
[35:05] in places that were not very comfortable
[35:08] but the Word of God was in great power
[35:09] and the Word of God went forth in a new
[35:13] church or a new body was being built
[35:17] called the Bride of Christ in the New
[35:20] Testament and they didn't worry about
[35:21] whether it was too cold or too hot or if
[35:24] they had enough to eat or if it was
[35:25] comfortable they just wanted to hear
[35:27] from you lord
[35:27] I pray that we have that same attitude
[35:30] that we want to hear from you Lord and
[35:32] not let any external things happen you
[35:35] take over this service Lord you'd be the
[35:37] active participant the one doing the
[35:39] speaking one doing their hearing Lord
[35:41] healed the sick save the lost be with
[35:43] the ones that are on the highways be
[35:46] with sister Janet Lord if she's up there
[35:47] in the hospital just touch the hands of
[35:49] the of the doctors Lord him she'll be
[35:52] fine with that procedure tomorrow
[35:54] brother Daugherty and all the ones that
[35:56] are not with us Lord with president
[35:57] should be with them just blessed Lord
[35:59] the missionaries on the foreign fields
[36:01] we always pray Lord that you'll give
[36:03] them fruit for the labor Lord and bless
[36:06] them and keep them safe forgive us of
[36:08] our sins Lord we're totally unworthy to
[36:10] be standing here but you've made us
[36:12] worthy through the blood of Jesus Christ
[36:14] just be with us now take care of us in
[36:16] Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6
[36:20] verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened
[36:22] one of the seals and I heard it was the
[36:24] noise of thunder one of the four beasts
[36:26] saying come and see and I saw him behold
[36:29] a white horse and he that sat on him out
[36:31] of bow and a crown was given unto him
[36:32] and he went forth conquering and to
[36:34] conquer you may be seated in the Lord I
[36:37] just blessing to the reading of the word
[36:39] we're gonna get this nice new thing out
[36:42] here and I get that oh I got it yeah I
[36:47] got it I won't have to the leg ain't
[36:48] sticking out so I can get this one see

[37:13] and now I have broke it y'all think I'm
[37:22] kidding I need a knife and I don't know
[37:33] what there we go
[37:34] Hey look at that that's pretty fun this
[37:39] one's different than the other one this
[37:41] one should last at least the two
[37:42] services look at that tada now I have to
[37:50] run up here and good to see brother
[37:54] David back with us today how you doing
[37:56] man
[37:56] good to see you good to see you all
[38:01] right do there and that cute you don't
[38:06] see that I know T said y'all can't
[38:08] hardly see it in the back but blessed is
[38:11] he that didn't see and believe so you in
[38:15] the back here in the back you believe
[38:17] what you can't see a scripture all right
[38:22] so now let's start and begin will
[38:25] overview this in a minute but let's put
[38:27] back number 1 on the board from the
[38:30] sixth seal and let's kind of get a
[38:31] background again I hope last Sunday was
[38:34] was was a help that showed you the the
[38:38] seal was like Bob was talking about will
[38:41] and I never said it but it's exactly
[38:43] what it is there's twins and everything
[38:45] there's twins it's just you got Cain and
[38:48] Abel you got guarding the devil you got
[38:51] you know you got Esau and Jacob
[38:53] and then you've got Jesus and Judas and
[38:55] now you've got the church in the bride
[38:58] and then you've got the church in the
[39:00] bride you got to you've got twins and
[39:03] every every revival so here we go
[39:07] and let's just look at this real quick
[39:09] number one brother I'm sending the sixth
[39:11] seal and Isaiah let's take this Isaiah
[39:14] the prophet seemed this sixth seal open
[39:16] and spoke of it that's whether it's
[39:18] important or not well the whole thing
[39:21] the whole plan of redemption weighs
[39:23] under those seals the whole book now
[39:25] watch he says lays under those seals all
[39:28] right so it lays under the seal the seal
[39:31] being what we were talking about last
[39:33] Sunday this is the seal this is one had
[39:36] it sealed up that what that Christ that
[39:40] many men even the prophet of God in the
[39:42] first part of their ministry this was
[39:45] all the Holy Ghost in the first part and
[39:49] many many commentaries this you know it
[39:52] says the white horse is the purity of
[39:54] God and it's the Holy Ghost and it's a
[39:56] bow shooting the Cupid's arrows and you
[39:58] know how brother bottom explained all
[39:59] that crammed in then we come up and see
[40:02] when the seal broke we we saw it was
[40:03] totally opposite totally opposite none
[40:08] of this has anything to do with God this
[40:12] is not Christ this is not Christ this is
[40:15] not Christ this is not Christ but as we
[40:18] were talking about last Sunday that to
[40:22] have a white horse rider you had to have
[40:25] in the first three church ages you had
[40:28] to have a righteous church
[40:32] as Bob was saying this morning's under
[40:34] schooner he's doing a good job there
[40:36] with birth pains because it's showing
[40:37] two births there but you got to see the
[40:40] opposite there is no way that Satan has
[40:43] ever originated anything he always has
[40:48] to wait on God now why would you want to
[40:51] follow somebody that followed somebody
[40:56] why would you want to follow somebody
[40:58] that follow somebody we want to follow
[41:01] Christ amen we want to follow the
[41:04] originator because this is not original
[41:08] this is a copy off of the original as we
[41:12] showed here that Satan had a bow in
[41:14] allows but God's got the sword of his
[41:17] word amen and he give it to me in you
[41:20] amen and this sword of the word like we
[41:23] were talking about last Sunday this sort
[41:25] of the word had no denominational idea
[41:28] in it whatsoever
[41:29] now there were sayings we're gonna talk
[41:32] about that in just a little while there
[41:34] were little things that were already
[41:35] coming as Paul says in Thessalonians he
[41:38] said he said the one who's now working
[41:41] in other words he was excuse me he was
[41:43] working there now remember we crown him
[41:46] King of Kings Satan put that crown on
[41:49] his head cuz the Bible said the crown
[41:50] was given all right and then he went
[41:53] forth conquering in to conquer and what
[41:55] did he conquer he started out with a
[41:56] little saying now look the way God
[42:01] starts out Satan copies right we got
[42:06] that down so we see that God has went
[42:09] out and in the first three Church ages
[42:13] watch how he works because you see the
[42:15] plan of redemption and now Lord you
[42:18] ought to be able to see the plan of
[42:19] redemption all the way back to Adam and
[42:23] Eve and even before the fall
[42:27] like that was saying this morning I you
[42:29] know you don't think the planes like
[42:31] that but but Adam never went through a
[42:34] justified condition he never went to a
[42:38] sanctifying condition
[42:40] he was just imparted to baptism of the
[42:42] Holy Ghost he was given the Holy Ghost
[42:44] all right to be the first son but now as
[42:49] we have fell this is what we're going to
[42:53] look at the mystery of iniquity the man
[42:55] you have to get this because when we
[42:57] fail that brought a whole new meaning to
[43:02] what God was doing now not what God's
[43:04] doing listen God never changes we change
[43:07] so God never changes his his plan was
[43:10] the same all along man his times plan
[43:14] never changed his plans stayed the same
[43:17] it's just what we did is we adjusted to
[43:20] it but watch what happened Satan did the
[43:22] same thing he saw a white righteous
[43:25] church walk out with a with the power
[43:28] and anointing of the Holy Ghost doing
[43:31] the work and Satan said I think I'll
[43:33] just slide in there and get I'm not
[43:36] going to go to the bar I'm not gonna
[43:39] bring more prostitution I'm going to
[43:42] bring more church members I'm gonna get
[43:46] on a seemingly a white horse now
[43:51] remember these are symbols you'll never
[43:54] see Satan riding a white horse you got
[43:57] that but John saw in symbolic remember
[44:00] we read it last Sunday and sympathies
[44:02] are all symbols to show me in you
[44:04] something all right excuse me I've got
[44:09] me some water so looked up so there must
[44:14] be a plan of redemption now when we get
[44:15] into this mystery of iniquity is
[44:17] something that really help me is the
[44:20] problem
[44:22] and if you'll look 263 times the Bible
[44:27] talks about iniquity 240 of them are in
[44:31] the Old Testament so almost 3/4 of them
[44:35] are in the Old Testament they're talking
[44:36] about iniquity there's not so much
[44:38] iniquity brought out in the New
[44:40] Testament why because we're going to see
[44:43] today I hope just by reading the Bible
[44:45] that that we got trapped because of
[44:50] Adam's iniquity and then so what happens
[44:55] is as we still and you do too and I do
[44:57] too we still think that things got us so
[45:00] bound we can't get out of it that's the
[45:03] mystery of iniquity
[45:05] because we're going to read it the
[45:08] mystery of iniquity is it's worth hung
[45:10] into this thing right here because
[45:13] remember there was no iniquity and Adam
[45:15] soul atom soul was this perfect just God
[45:18] and if you're born again today your soul
[45:21] is just as perfect as God it's not
[45:23] doesn't have iniquity iniquities not
[45:25] found in us in our soul ok but well now
[45:31] what are we working on redemption of the
[45:34] body redemption on the outside guy
[45:38] getting that getting the spirit realm to
[45:41] where we don't just talk about iniquity
[45:47] being done away with there's a
[45:49] difference in talking about something
[45:50] being done away with and you know what
[45:53] something's been done away with a man
[45:54] like when many times when we come up to
[45:57] the to the new birth and we're going to
[45:58] talk about justification next Sunday and
[46:01] in a way that that mirrors what you did
[46:06] in the first part but remember I can
[46:08] remember the things I used to do I
[46:12] didn't do it anymore I had no desire to
[46:14] do that but I knew it wasn't born again
[46:16] because it always kept leaning back
[46:19] toward that why because that thing
[46:20] inside of me was still there a man that
[46:24] mystery of iniquity was still working
[46:27] because remember your iniquity was found
[46:30] in who Satan
[46:31] so he's the author of iniquity he's the
[46:34] number one guy when it
[46:35] to that because remember he was how in
[46:38] the world can you stand and look at the
[46:40] man that created you and think you're
[46:43] better than him how can you do that well
[46:47] so that's what Satan did he said you I
[46:50] didn't bring it but in Hezekiah's
[46:52] since you were made perfect until
[46:56] iniquity was found in you hey man
[47:00] God made him perfect God didn't make him
[47:03] so Satan he brings iniquity out and
[47:05] God's hates it so much though well we
[47:08] will read it in the Old Testament but
[47:12] that iniquities got to be done away with
[47:15] and there's only one way that an equity
[47:18] can be done away with him we're going to
[47:20] read it here in a little while but let's
[47:22] go to the next one where we pulled up
[47:24] last Sunday where it says Redemption
[47:26] Redemption Redemption I want you to keep
[47:27] that plan of redemption breaking in the
[47:31] seals is not necessarily for the soul
[47:32] the soul is redeemed by the new birth
[47:35] the shed blood of Jesus Christ at
[47:37] Calvary but we'll bring full fellowship
[47:40] and I want to put back into
[47:43] manifestation because remember before
[47:45] the fall Adam had full complete
[47:47] fellowship with God there was no
[47:49] iniquity found in Adam at that time
[47:53] Satan had to come in and help that
[47:55] develop in Adam but not in Adam soul
[47:59] okay cuz remember there's only in that
[48:08] inside man faith or doubt not gray area
[48:13] in between but now in that second room
[48:15] you can have memory reason conscious
[48:17] affection imagination Satan can work
[48:19] through all five God can work through
[48:21] all five man and that's our problem
[48:23] because this body there's nothing wrong
[48:25] with this body now we're really we were
[48:27] born in sin shaping an iniquity we'll
[48:28] read that in a minute David knew that
[48:31] but
[48:33] we gotta have an out there's got to be
[48:37] an out or we're just going to keep like
[48:39] bob says with death is not shame by no
[48:43] means but I want to go on to perfection
[48:46] and I want to cross over that pass that
[48:50] I'm 58 now I'm getting closer all right
[48:58] let's go to the next one number two
[49:01] first steal we read these last Sunday
[49:04] but I just want to kind of read these
[49:04] and then we'll get on the mystery of
[49:07] iniquity all right number two the first
[49:08] seal Jeffersonville Indiana at the end
[49:10] of the pen coughs the blades we're
[49:11] supposed to receive according to the
[49:13] word god help us to not to show you
[49:14] through here that we are to see hey
[49:17] Bobby can you see that
[49:19] good that's Sunday school class he's got
[49:23] letters about that high
[49:25] poor old sister treating McMillan if
[49:28] she'd have been a giraffe she still
[49:29] would have been like she's trying to
[49:30] read and I was trying to read to you
[49:32] make big fonts so we can see there's
[49:38] that mystery of iniquity thank you we
[49:42] are to see we are to see receive a
[49:44] messenger that will take all those loose
[49:46] ends out there and reveal the whole
[49:48] secret of God for the rapture of the
[49:50] church listen we should put all of our
[49:53] dependency listen not on what william
[49:56] brown said on paper but what he has give
[50:01] us is the entire Word of God back the
[50:04] way it should have been when Jesus was
[50:07] standing on the earth hey man no one
[50:10] else could do that but God Himself
[50:11] through a man amen but he give it to us
[50:16] to carry it on and then and then there's
[50:20] coming for seven mysterious thunders
[50:22] there's not even written at all in other
[50:24] words remember there's not one two three
[50:26] four five like the the seals it's
[50:28] revelation 6:1 and the first seal is and
[50:31] the second seal is and the third all the
[50:33] way down there's no scripture that says
[50:35] and the first under is and the second
[50:37] Thunder has got it but it has to be in
[50:39] the entire Bible that's why I say these
[50:42] thunders have to be something about
[50:45] Redemption
[50:46] because Redemption starts in Genesis and
[50:49] it ends in Revelation the whole thing
[50:53] we're going to read it
[50:55] look what Israel did to God Israel turn
[51:00] from God God said if you'll follow my
[51:03] statutes and my judgments so he said
[51:04] you'll never have a problem next king
[51:06] popped up he starts putting idols up
[51:08] next king comes up he takes the temple
[51:11] down next King comes up he puts the
[51:13] Groves up and he's put golden calves up
[51:15] he starts putting this up and gods like
[51:17] what's the deal you're committing
[51:22] iniquity that's why you see David in the
[51:24] Book of Psalms iniquities used two
[51:26] hundred times because he knew what that
[51:28] was
[51:29] and then there's coming for seven
[51:31] mysterious thunders there's not even
[51:33] written at all that's right and I
[51:35] believe that through these seven
[51:36] thunders will be revealed in the last
[51:38] days in order to get the bride together
[51:40] for right during faith because what we
[51:43] got right now we wouldn't be able to do
[51:45] that right there's something we've got
[51:47] to step further hey man so we got a step
[51:50] further than what we have been stepping
[51:52] down through the church ages down to the
[51:55] church ages a church age messenger would
[51:58] come he would get the revelation that
[52:00] God give him he would bring it to the
[52:01] people and what would happen messenger
[52:04] will come at the end of the age he'd
[52:05] bring his message of what would go great
[52:07] for a while but all of a sudden what
[52:08] would happen he start curving down Satan
[52:13] would start injecting more and more and
[52:15] more and what happened brother Branham
[52:17] says about the time they all
[52:18] denominating died god what there's a
[52:21] porter standing here he brings a message
[52:23] to the next age lifts them up out of
[52:25] that church age brings a message of a
[52:28] spiritual war starch that's what's
[52:31] happening now we're not we're not
[52:33] fighting
[52:34] we're not fighting North Korea we're
[52:37] fighting demons and then and if there
[52:40] was no demons North Korea would be a
[52:42] nice place to live right so we're
[52:48] fighting demons are not fighting people
[52:52] all right let's go to number three
[52:57] revelations chapter five number two see
[53:00] what it's doing it's these seals opening
[53:01] up just begin to reveal the what the
[53:04] plan of redemption how he did it
[53:08] it's all over now just about just about
[53:10] finishing up so we're at the end time so
[53:13] that's why the things are being revealed
[53:15] now look like I said last Sunday if
[53:17] you'll remember there has to be
[53:19] something already there to be reveal you
[53:26] can't reveal nothing because there's
[53:28] nothing there to reveal and then so
[53:31] there's got to be something that has
[53:33] been hid it's there it's in here it's in
[53:42] here but it's got to be revealed it's
[53:47] already there that's my brother Brown
[53:48] they said oh you can write a 23rd
[53:50] chapter of Revelations he said sounds
[53:52] good but what would that be doing they'd
[53:55] be adding to what God's already wrote
[53:57] and said it is finished this is the it
[53:58] it's done all right so it's got to be
[54:00] contained in the Bible it's got to be
[54:05] contained in the Bible that's like the
[54:08] Daniel 70 weeks you know people can go
[54:11] all all the quotes and all the all the
[54:15] things and it sounds you know I say to
[54:17] you it sounds like brother Branham is
[54:18] contrary but the Bible is real plain
[54:23] seventy weeks are determined all right
[54:27] there's a one week period one week equal
[54:31] seven years there's a seven there's a 62
[54:34] which is 69 now they ain't no halves in
[54:37] there right the Bible says what and he
[54:40] shall make a covenant with many for one
[54:42] week
[54:43] that's not three and a half years and
[54:46] when who is he he is not God because God
[54:50] don't make a covenant and break it so
[54:52] it's got to be this Antichrist that
[54:54] we're talking about and he shall make a
[54:56] covenant with many for one week now we
[54:59] do have to go back to the prophets
[55:00] message and realize you and I are not
[55:03] here when that Sun when this first seal
[55:06] opens in this I got it my nose and it's
[55:09] normal in its natural form we're not
[55:12] here and then collects the Israel
[55:15] revelation 6 it goes to them right and
[55:17] the man of sin sitting in temple of God
[55:20] we don't see that so who's that he he
[55:23] the Antichrist shall make a covenant
[55:25] with many for one week now help me add 7
[55:28] plus 62 is what thank you 69 I'm glad
[55:35] you said that some of these others that
[55:36] they were but that's 69 no halves no
[55:41] quarters 69 and Christ was cut off
[55:46] what so then the Gentile bride could fit
[55:49] in 2,000 years then when we leave he
[55:53] shall make a covenant with many for how
[55:55] long one week so that's what we left
[55:59] after the rapture I don't care what
[56:00] anybody says that's the Bible face final
[56:05] resting places in that word people and
[56:07] brother branham being a word prophet he
[56:09] could not say anything different than
[56:11] that and man we're just not
[56:13] understanding what he is saying like
[56:16] brother Dale was talking about this
[56:17] morning he read a quote that seemed like
[56:19] in the same quote he was not contrary
[56:23] but come out at a different angle and
[56:26] that's okay if we come out at a
[56:27] different angle but it was the same
[56:29] thing once you got finished and that's
[56:31] the same thing with Daniel 7 weeks you
[56:33] can take all the quotes you can take all
[56:34] the things you want to but the Bible
[56:36] says there's a seven week to 62 week and
[56:38] one week that's 70 weeks not no halves
[56:42] in there anywhere because people in the
[56:45] message say that that we've only got
[56:47] three and a half years of Daniel seventy
[56:48] weeks which that's not true according to
[56:49] the Bible according the prophets message
[56:51] so but now that mystery of iniquity of
[56:54] iniquity is working we think all that
[56:57] mystery of iniquity is in denomination
[57:02] come on people it's out yonder in them
[57:07] denomination now why would he be out
[57:11] there when the perfection is in here
[57:15] I thought it was so close I didn't think
[57:20] it was so far away that's why I see
[57:25] Satan's not going to get us with a
[57:27] father son Holy Ghost baptism he's not
[57:29] going to get us with an eternal hell to
[57:33] me that's that's already wrote off that
[57:36] mystery has already been made known it's
[57:39] the mystery that's right here in this
[57:41] church and in here because let's read
[57:48] now 2nd Thessalonians does everybody
[57:53] okay to this remember we had a we had a
[57:55] white righteous church on the earth at
[57:57] the same time that Satan has brought his
[58:01] sayings started out as a little saying
[58:04] serene theist you know he says well
[58:06] Jesus was a like substance of god that
[58:09] was in Irina's this time that was in the
[58:10] Second Age so it wasn't far after
[58:12] Jesus's death did that that the people
[58:14] are already going well he wasn't God
[58:17] till till the River Jordan until God
[58:19] came down on him and well we understand
[58:21] that but but some people don't see
[58:24] that's another thing
[58:25] uess know what you're doing you're
[58:27] making you're making a second person
[58:30] when you do that and then so there's
[58:33] another mystery that to me is being made
[58:35] known through this message of the hour
[58:38] there's clarity we know that this is
[58:42] Adam is divided there's the true and the
[58:45] false but the real mystery is is where
[58:49] is that that's the real mystery is where
[58:53] it's at done all right there man now
[59:00] remember before we read this let me read
[59:03] you a few things around here remember it
[59:06] takes revelation to break the seal it
[59:11] takes a revelation God has to speak to
[59:13] you knock the brother Dale sure he's got
[59:15] to give it to the minister first but
[59:18] he's got to come to you amen
[59:21] all right what it's so what
[59:24] hello he's now closest thing is if it's
[59:28] not revealed to you it's the same
[59:30] because look God never revealed that
[59:33] saying that they said that there was an
[59:35] eternal hell
[59:37] God can't reveal that but somebody
[59:42] revealed it so much til they took it his
[59:44] doctrine father son Holy Ghost baptism
[59:46] it started as a saying God never told
[59:49] people to be baptized name father son
[59:50] holy go so it had to be Satan and his
[59:53] saying not the first church age that was
[59:57] a pure Church that had a revelation of
[1:00:01] one true and living God we're gonna see
[1:00:03] this seal is gonna wind up to that to
[1:00:05] see one true and living God amen
[1:00:08] all right to see that mystery of
[1:00:10] iniquity hey look if you can do this see
[1:00:13] what's happening now is we're working
[1:00:15] real close you know here's the devil and
[1:00:19] here's God but brother Brian said here
[1:00:22] goes a white horse rider riding away but
[1:00:25] he's taking what that mystery of
[1:00:27] iniquity is being made known so there's
[1:00:29] a separation one day Judas had to
[1:00:34] separate from Christ there had to be a
[1:00:37] separation something happened Jacob and
[1:00:40] Esau grew up in the same house came out
[1:00:42] of the same womb ate at the same table
[1:00:44] had the same righteous mother and father
[1:00:47] but one day what happened they had to
[1:00:50] separate right Cain and Abel Cain's
[1:00:53] problem was he went out from the
[1:00:55] presence of God so the Bible says in
[1:00:57] Genesis that was Cain's problem if he
[1:00:59] would have stayed there God could have
[1:01:02] helped him but he went out what he
[1:01:04] separated amen
[1:01:07] so when you see the separation you have
[1:01:09] the true and the false
[1:01:11] and that's what you and I need to see is
[1:01:14] the true and the false
[1:01:16] that all right so the revelation is what
[1:01:20] breaks to see them not any man except
[1:01:22] Christ all right so the voice of God
[1:01:27] which is the Thunder will read that in a
[1:01:30] couple of Sunday's from them it's going
[1:01:34] to not just tell me
[1:01:36] it's going to tell you not a private
[1:01:42] thing it is to you individually but what
[1:01:46] I'm saying is once it's given out once
[1:01:49] the profit stood that day and said here
[1:01:52] stands a land with the book of hand
[1:01:53] there goes wild horse rider see there
[1:01:55] God has already started doing the
[1:01:57] separating amen
[1:01:59] the man watch what brother brown Christ
[1:02:01] is revealed in his own word like brother
[1:02:02] Devon said read the titles of these
[1:02:04] sermons right souls in prison now my
[1:02:08] anointed ones at the end time man he
[1:02:10] knew that how to preach anointed ones
[1:02:12] because there had been a separation all
[1:02:15] right that okay say ma'am because
[1:02:18] remember we must know that this to me
[1:02:21] the seals is to show us what was what he
[1:02:26] is and what is to come
[1:02:28] it shows us the history of the church
[1:02:31] which is good it tells us what's going
[1:02:34] on right now and it's telling us what's
[1:02:36] going on even when we get out of here
[1:02:38] and man cuz this is all going to happen
[1:02:40] when we get out of here the man of sin
[1:02:42] is going to be sitting in the temple of
[1:02:43] God showing himself to be as God
[1:02:45] literally in a man
[1:02:47] but God's got it literally literally in
[1:02:52] case our become in me and you incarnate
[1:03:02] in us so then Satan says I see how to do
[1:03:06] it now he's waiting on us the very thing
[1:03:12] Satan thinks he's got God went for it's
[1:03:15] what US that's so vile iniquity sin
[1:03:19] Laden we can't get nothing right have a
[1:03:22] carnal mind we can't even think good
[1:03:24] thoughts every once in a while and
[1:03:27] Satan's going and that's God going to
[1:03:29] use that because he can't get a
[1:03:34] revelation of the true Word of God he
[1:03:38] sees what happens that he isn't you know
[1:03:40] like I said God's never had an aha
[1:03:41] moment you know when you go look let me
[1:03:43] go huh you know get cramps goes and cuts
[1:03:45] tough you know he goes uh-huh I didn't
[1:03:48] cut that right no see God don't have
[1:03:50] aha moment but Satan has him all the
[1:03:52] time Tango's aha that's how that happens
[1:03:55] why because he's not an originator he's
[1:04:00] a copycat man I don't want to follow a
[1:04:03] copycat do you but now remember our
[1:04:08] revelation must not be a saying it must
[1:04:13] be something that resides inside of you
[1:04:16] and I that's our problem brother branham
[1:04:21] said Samuel Dale said wait downstairs
[1:04:29] keep going Donny Regan's they said they
[1:04:32] said they said what what God say
[1:04:36] now if God and the man is one you better
[1:04:41] let you do it go that's the way God is
[1:04:43] gonna talk to you cuz listen I don't
[1:04:46] know about you but that's two things I
[1:04:47] have to deal with Garden the devil I'm
[1:04:52] stuck in there somewhere in between
[1:04:53] right I don't have to worry about like I
[1:04:58] said we don't worry about principalities
[1:04:59] and powers and what's coming up and all
[1:05:01] the moons that are doing this and global
[1:05:04] warming and one of the word about that
[1:05:06] step for you better be worried about you
[1:05:09] global warming ain't gonna be nothing
[1:05:11] when you're sitting in hell you gonna
[1:05:13] think global warming okay
[1:05:16] and nothing compared to if you go to the
[1:05:19] wrong place so let's go to heaven where
[1:05:21] the temperature is always gonna be the
[1:05:22] same and you know what it'll be it'll be
[1:05:25] to your liking Joyce it'll be hot but
[1:05:27] it'll be cool for me I have to walk up
[1:05:31] rejoicing shake your hand like this are
[1:05:34] you you don't have to wear sweater up
[1:05:36] three sweaters I promise you know and an
[1:05:41] overcoat thank you thank you then it's
[1:05:44] still freeze but you see what we're
[1:05:47] heading toward we're heading towards
[1:05:48] perfection and perfection is what
[1:05:50] perfection is what God God didn't put in
[1:05:54] there weighed their lights dick Addison
[1:05:56] light but you know what it's all in
[1:05:58] there
[1:06:00] whatever you desire that city is going
[1:06:03] to be built by what's in that Bible and
[1:06:06] it's gonna come from your desire ain't
[1:06:10] know what the property God said he said
[1:06:12] he's gonna build that city upon what you
[1:06:14] desire the desire of his bride so
[1:06:19] where's that gonna come from you
[1:06:21] it's gonna come from you so now let's
[1:06:29] read this and let's remember now as we
[1:06:35] go through this keep that word
[1:06:37] justification in your mind because we're
[1:06:40] getting there we're starting on
[1:06:41] Redemption right we start knowing on the
[1:06:43] mystery of iniquity but we're also going
[1:06:46] to be looking at Redemption and
[1:06:49] justification okay because remember
[1:06:52] those who has justified he's already
[1:06:54] glorified now that's not the
[1:06:55] justification when you become when you
[1:06:59] come up to the altar and say God forgive
[1:07:01] me of my sins well he does he's just to
[1:07:04] forgive you but you must go on to the
[1:07:07] sanctified condition then you must go on
[1:07:09] to the new birth of the baptism of the
[1:07:11] holy ghost then that justification will
[1:07:14] truly lead you to glorification amen but
[1:07:18] not just justification in its small self
[1:07:22] but now this justification that we're
[1:07:25] going to talk about when that mystery of
[1:07:27] iniquity is dirt away with that to me
[1:07:30] that's when I saw we see this cycle of
[1:07:33] death and we see this cycle of iniquity
[1:07:35] and how Satan beats us to death but I
[1:07:37] want you to see when we read this we're
[1:07:39] going to read the Bible today probably
[1:07:40] about ten scripture and I want you to
[1:07:43] see what God says to them before he went
[1:07:47] to Calvary before his blood was shed 2nd
[1:07:53] Thessalonians 2 verse 1 says now we
[1:07:55] beseech you brethren by the coming of
[1:07:58] our Lord Jesus Christ and by our
[1:07:59] gathering together unto Him that should
[1:08:02] be not soon shaken in mind or be
[1:08:04] troubled neither by spirit nor by word
[1:08:06] nor by letter as from us as that the day
[1:08:08] of Christ is at hand now watch brother
[1:08:11] branham's tells us
[1:08:12] he says what Paul's doing is trying to
[1:08:14] tell the Thessalonians that God's not
[1:08:16] coming right at that moment he's not
[1:08:20] coming right then
[1:08:21] all right because watch what's got
[1:08:22] there's things gonna happen he says let
[1:08:25] no man now look it has come from a
[1:08:27] spirit the spirit which is a saying look
[1:08:30] you can't see a say right now when they
[1:08:35] make it a doctor and that's when they
[1:08:36] write it down on piece paper
[1:08:37] all right Aidid is something you do but
[1:08:40] when somebody just talks it's the same
[1:08:43] it's a spirit something you can't see
[1:08:46] but it's very powerful let no man
[1:08:49] deceive you by any means for that day
[1:08:53] shall not come what the day of Christ
[1:08:56] that day the day of Christ is at hand
[1:08:58] let no man deceive you by any means for
[1:09:00] that day shall not come except there
[1:09:02] come a falling away first now look in
[1:09:06] its in its infancy it happened in every
[1:09:08] Church age that's it in its infancy
[1:09:11] potentially it was heading toward
[1:09:14] something you ever heard that word
[1:09:15] potential okay a lot okay you gonna hear
[1:09:19] it some more because potentially that's
[1:09:22] what happened in every Church age there
[1:09:23] wasn't falling away and but they didn't
[1:09:26] know what that man's name was that man
[1:09:28] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[1:09:31] because what they do they went some
[1:09:35] accepted that doctrine and they went on
[1:09:37] in the denomination some accepted the
[1:09:40] message of Paul irena smarten Colombian
[1:09:43] all the way down and what will they died
[1:09:45] in faith they died in the faith that
[1:09:48] Paul preached and then it became their
[1:09:51] faith and then when it started dwindling
[1:09:53] down a falling away came what God raised
[1:09:57] up Iranians to bring a message then a
[1:10:00] people took that message and not only
[1:10:02] listened to it became that message amen
[1:10:06] so we see the type down through the
[1:10:08] church ages but that man of sin I'll
[1:10:10] promise you he was sitting there he was
[1:10:13] right there in the church with them cuz
[1:10:15] every time they'd get a revelation
[1:10:17] Satan would say okay let's denominator
[1:10:19] that sounds real good
[1:10:21] don't it just don't it just you know
[1:10:23] icicles down you down your back makes
[1:10:25] you feel good
[1:10:26] let's denominator on that and some of
[1:10:29] the people says okay we'll make a
[1:10:30] Lutheran doctrine out of it
[1:10:33] we'll make a Wesleyan or a Methodist
[1:10:35] doctrine out of it but what did the
[1:10:37] property guard say now God moved on they
[1:10:41] stayed and God moved on well that was
[1:10:42] the separation that mystery of iniquity
[1:10:45] was still working that rider was still
[1:10:48] in there working as seemingly the right
[1:10:52] thing to do and at the time you know the
[1:10:56] Baptist were right for their time
[1:10:59] Methodists were right for their time but
[1:11:02] remember you can't take a Lutheran
[1:11:04] doctrine and sit here and that's just
[1:11:08] become Lutheran's I said the Lutheran
[1:11:11] doctrine that they stopped on the just
[1:11:15] shall live by faith let's go have a beer
[1:11:17] and smoke some well a few years we'll be
[1:11:20] smoking weed if it keeps going man
[1:11:23] California and all Colorado Lord of
[1:11:26] Mercy you talk about insanity now it's
[1:11:29] legal that you know what that's them
[1:11:35] though I mean they're gonna do what
[1:11:37] they're gonna do and you and I are going
[1:11:38] to be right here but that man of sin
[1:11:40] it's not in that smoking the weed
[1:11:41] drinking the beer he's in the church
[1:11:43] because where they got that doctrine was
[1:11:46] was in the church they got it from
[1:11:49] Martin Luther they got it from John
[1:11:51] Wesley they got it from the Pentecost
[1:11:53] and they got it from brother Branham if
[1:11:55] it's not true I said they got it not him
[1:12:00] listen brother Brown brought us a pure
[1:12:02] word of God what's all this junk doing
[1:12:03] out here it's that same horse rider
[1:12:05] it's that same rider except now it's not
[1:12:08] just one it's four of them it's all of
[1:12:11] them
[1:12:13] right if it's going to take all four
[1:12:17] horse riders I mean combat beasts to get
[1:12:21] us out of here
[1:12:21] guess where they're riding it up guess
[1:12:23] who's riding in opposition it's those
[1:12:25] four horse riders were talking about but
[1:12:27] he started off as a pure white church to
[1:12:29] get us what to get us close to get us
[1:12:32] involved to get us real close while it's
[1:12:34] okay you think what you want to like Bob
[1:12:36] was telling me this morning
[1:12:37] now that the Pentecostals and
[1:12:39] Episcopalians and the Catholics are all
[1:12:41] getting together unity and diversity
[1:12:45] let's say that again unity in diversity
[1:12:48] you see how insane that is but that's
[1:12:52] going to bring them all together I've
[1:12:54] got written in my nose down here to last
[1:12:55] but I'll tell you now listen God is a
[1:12:57] segregationist God is a segregation was
[1:13:02] he told Israel he said do not marry
[1:13:05] those Gentiles and I'll bless you they
[1:13:10] went round and married them hey man I
[1:13:12] got right down here to bottom
[1:13:16] all these doctrines God wanted us
[1:13:20] separated you don't want us to be a
[1:13:25] Baptist denomination now we have Baptist
[1:13:28] truth predestination and things like
[1:13:31] that we have us part of the truth that
[1:13:32] come from those churches and man
[1:13:34] listen brother Brown didn't come up with
[1:13:36] these words like theophany and lo Goss
[1:13:38] that was way before him look in your
[1:13:42] Scofield Bible Scofield was before my
[1:13:44] brother Branham came and he's talking
[1:13:46] about logos and the off and he and all
[1:13:48] these things now now but then you look
[1:13:50] at Scofield and he says the trinity is
[1:13:53] laced throughout the Bible we'll see you
[1:13:55] can take that and dump it out cuz that
[1:13:56] was a wild rider that was one riding
[1:13:58] through but there was truth in there
[1:14:00] that what you and I have got to see the
[1:14:02] separation and only the revealed Word of
[1:14:07] God is going to show the separation all
[1:14:08] right let no man deceive you by any
[1:14:10] means that for that day shall not come
[1:14:12] except there come a falling away first
[1:14:14] and that man of sin be revealed so in
[1:14:16] other words to you and I he's going to
[1:14:19] be totally so revealed to we're not
[1:14:21] going to be anywhere near him
[1:14:23] segregationist we're gonna segregate
[1:14:26] from that alright the son of perdition
[1:14:29] who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[1:14:32] all that is called God or that is
[1:14:36] worshipped so that he as God sitteth in
[1:14:40] the temple of God he's made his way into
[1:14:42] the very temple of God showing himself
[1:14:46] not to be like God showing himself that
[1:14:49] He is God remember ye not that when I
[1:14:55] was yet with you I told you these things
[1:14:57] that's been 2000 years ago when Paul
[1:15:00] said that and now you know what
[1:15:02] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[1:15:05] his time no words Paul said now you know
[1:15:07] why that the rapture is not gonna take
[1:15:08] place in my church age because this
[1:15:10] man's got to be what he's got to make
[1:15:12] his ride he's got to what there's got to
[1:15:15] be the word that goes forth and then
[1:15:17] there's got to be this guy this fellow
[1:15:19] that's gonna ride with him but there's
[1:15:21] going to be a separation somewhere and
[1:15:23] there'll be a great falling away and we
[1:15:26] see now like I said before in in small
[1:15:28] form there was a fall
[1:15:29] we never aged but look they were falling
[1:15:32] away a lot of times from part truth Hey
[1:15:34] where people are falling away now from
[1:15:36] the truth the purest truth that ever
[1:15:40] hits the face of the earth and people
[1:15:41] are saying oh he was wrong here he was
[1:15:43] wrong here he was it and now you know
[1:15:47] what withholdeth that he might be
[1:15:48] revealed in his time now this is the
[1:15:50] time all right
[1:15:54] the true revelation of who we are is
[1:15:58] going to change our body that's this
[1:15:59] time for the mystery of iniquity
[1:16:03] now Nick what is what a hideous sin we
[1:16:06] know that it's it's has several meanings
[1:16:08] that's knowing to do good and not doing
[1:16:10] it or knowing not to do good and you do
[1:16:13] the bad part you got the good sitting
[1:16:16] right here and you said no I'm not gonna
[1:16:17] do that one to this see that's a hideous
[1:16:20] sin
[1:16:20] that's why Eve wasn't she wasn't part of
[1:16:23] that iniquity she didn't know no better
[1:16:27] Adam knew better
[1:16:29] he was the word for the day and he knew
[1:16:31] if he turned that down and went with her
[1:16:34] what would happen that he would sell the
[1:16:36] human race out because I read it right
[1:16:38] here a little while because of items
[1:16:40] iniquity for the mystery of iniquity
[1:16:45] doth already work so okay it's already
[1:16:48] beginning Paul said only he never only
[1:16:51] took a profit to tell us who that he was
[1:16:55] because it's not a capital H it's a
[1:16:58] little age but he said God it's only he
[1:17:02] who now letteth will wear what God's
[1:17:05] gonna let this thing go on until he he
[1:17:08] said the bride the church be taken out
[1:17:11] of the way so now it's gonna happen
[1:17:13] until we be taken out of the way then
[1:17:16] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[1:17:19] what the son of perdition the one that's
[1:17:21] going to stand in the temple of God and
[1:17:23] say I am God he's gonna go to Israel I
[1:17:27] am God
[1:17:31] I've come and he's going to take his
[1:17:35] little Gentile self and walk in that
[1:17:37] temple and him 144,000 are not gonna
[1:17:40] like that cuz they're gonna say hey wait
[1:17:44] a minute
[1:17:44] you're no we know who you are see how
[1:17:48] see how gods come up and he's brought a
[1:17:50] people to a place like you and I were
[1:17:52] already gone so he's brought us to what
[1:17:55] to the apex the heads come down on the
[1:17:58] body he's changed us took us out of here
[1:18:01] drop drop back down to Israel and here
[1:18:03] stand Satan again in the highest form
[1:18:07] he's ever been he's fixing to take over
[1:18:10] the world by religion and then that
[1:18:15] wicked shall be revealed whom the Lord
[1:18:17] shall consume with the spirit of his
[1:18:18] mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:18:20] brightness of his coming even him whose
[1:18:22] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:18:24] with all power signs and lying wonders
[1:18:27] look he's not a defenseless guy all
[1:18:31] power and signs and lying wonders that's
[1:18:34] why it's going to be a battle between
[1:18:35] two prophets and the Pope or whatever
[1:18:38] you want to say the man of sin and with
[1:18:42] all deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[1:18:44] them that perish because they received
[1:18:46] not now look they didn't receive they
[1:18:49] didn't receive not the truth
[1:18:52] they were seeing not the love of the
[1:18:55] truth that they might be saved so
[1:18:58] there's an out see I'm looking for an
[1:19:02] out I'm not looking for a I'm not
[1:19:04] looking for a back door but I'm looking
[1:19:06] for an out because I'm caught I'm caught
[1:19:09] in this you're caught in this we're
[1:19:12] looking for a way that God's already
[1:19:13] destroyed and we're gonna read it in
[1:19:15] just a little while it's always been in
[1:19:16] the Bible and for this cause God shall
[1:19:19] send them strong delusion that they
[1:19:22] should believe a lie now remember
[1:19:25] brother Browne said deal I the one Satan
[1:19:30] told Eve right all right so now let's
[1:19:33] read I want to read these we're gonna
[1:19:34] read scripture now because we're gonna
[1:19:36] take it from the Bible now look in the
[1:19:39] hebrew lexicon let's see what let's see
[1:19:43] what that word iniquity means now we
[1:19:45] know it comes from perversity depravity
[1:19:49] and but look at this right here see it
[1:19:53] word out there guilt guilt and guilt and
[1:19:58] guilt
[1:20:00] so iniquity is we were guilty and man we
[1:20:04] were guilty couldn't get out from under
[1:20:07] it we can't get out from under it cousin
[1:20:12] tells us we're guilty we're guilty we're
[1:20:14] guilty we're guilty but there is a way
[1:20:18] out I don't say at 53 verse 4 now we're
[1:20:20] gonna read all scriptures I got a few
[1:20:23] quotes maybe at the end but we may not
[1:20:25] read them let's read these and let's
[1:20:27] break them down a little bit because
[1:20:28] remember the mystery of iniquity is
[1:20:31] working in the people it's keeping us
[1:20:34] under something that we don't think we
[1:20:37] can get out of why we we put people in
[1:20:42] the ground this past year have we it's
[1:20:45] still working
[1:20:48] surely he has borne our griefs now this
[1:20:50] is I you know who this is this is Christ
[1:20:51] I wanted to bring this one first so this
[1:20:53] is the whole originator of everything
[1:20:55] how we got from under this yet we did
[1:20:58] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[1:21:00] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:21:02] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:21:06] iniquity remember he had no iniquity no
[1:21:09] iniquity was found in him amen
[1:21:12] but there's plenty of us the
[1:21:15] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:21:17] and with His stripes we were healed all
[1:21:19] we like sheep have gone astray we have
[1:21:22] turned every one to his own way and the
[1:21:25] LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[1:21:28] all so whatever iniquity we have we
[1:21:33] don't have it anymore if you'll believe
[1:21:37] that because where is it it's laid on
[1:21:42] him we don't believe what the Bible says
[1:21:44] the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[1:21:48] of us all then all rights a man
[1:21:54] all right look at Titus Titus 2 verse 11
[1:21:58] for the grace of God that bringeth
[1:22:00] salvation has appeared to all men
[1:22:01] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[1:22:05] worldly lusts we should live soberly
[1:22:06] righteously godly in this present world
[1:22:11] looking for that blessed hope and the
[1:22:13] glorious appearing of the Great God and
[1:22:15] our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself
[1:22:17] for us that he might redeem we have
[1:22:21] heard that word Redemption that he might
[1:22:24] redeem us from all iniquity so where's
[1:22:29] our inequity where we piling this onus
[1:22:31] for why we're doing it now guilty guilty
[1:22:37] guilty might redeem us from all iniquity
[1:22:42] and purify unto himself a peculiar in
[1:22:48] other words let me say I separated
[1:22:50] people zealous of good works who gave
[1:22:55] himself for us that he might redeem us
[1:22:57] from all iniquity so we were caught we
[1:23:02] were caught in this mystery of iniquity
[1:23:05] amen but there's a way out not just from
[1:23:11] your soul all of you Micah 7 they shall
[1:23:25] lick the dust like a serpent they shall
[1:23:27] move out of their holes like worms of
[1:23:29] the earth that shall be afraid of the
[1:23:31] Lord our God and shall fear because of
[1:23:33] thee who is a god like unto thee that
[1:23:37] pardon if iniquity we had it but he's
[1:23:42] fixing to annihilate it do away with it
[1:23:45] what does pardon pardon when you write
[1:23:47] to pardon
[1:23:48] remember once you accept it you're not
[1:23:51] guilty right you're not guilty they
[1:23:55] can't ever bring it back up even in a
[1:23:58] court of law the the natural court of
[1:24:01] the law you can't ever bring that back
[1:24:03] up you kill 10 more people and they'd
[1:24:06] never bring it back up if you've been
[1:24:08] pardoned so what about a god they can
[1:24:13] pardon that pardon if iniquity and pass
[1:24:17] this by the transgression of the remnant
[1:24:20] of his heritage now who's he talking
[1:24:22] about you and I he retained this not his
[1:24:27] anger forever because he delighteth in
[1:24:30] mercy he will turn again he will have
[1:24:35] compassion horton so my preach on that
[1:24:37] the other day he say sympathy it's
[1:24:44] compassion upon us and he will subdue
[1:24:47] our iniquities
[1:24:51] and that will cast all their sins into
[1:24:55] the depths of the sea that's where you
[1:25:00] get the scripture he put my sins in the
[1:25:03] depths of the sea right there
[1:25:08] Psalms 51 now here's a man that knows
[1:25:14] about iniquity
[1:25:15] because Psalm 51 look at your footnote
[1:25:18] with Scofield to the chief musician a
[1:25:20] psalm of David when Nathan the prophet
[1:25:22] came unto him after he had gone into
[1:25:24] Bathsheba remember he goes in and
[1:25:26] commits adultery and he's getting ready
[1:25:28] to father a an unwed child and have his
[1:25:32] best friend kill right have mercy upon
[1:25:35] me O God according to thy
[1:25:37] loving-kindness according unto the
[1:25:39] multitude of thy tender mercies blot out
[1:25:41] my transgressions wash me thoroughly
[1:25:46] from mine iniquity and cleanse me from
[1:25:51] my sin for I acknowledge there's the
[1:25:56] thing he repented I acknowledge my
[1:26:00] transgressions and my sin is ever before
[1:26:04] me against thee thee only have I sinned
[1:26:09] he didn't sin against Betsy but he
[1:26:11] didn't sin against your riah uh yeah
[1:26:14] I'll get you out your sin against then
[1:26:15] he said against God writes what he said
[1:26:20] against the the only have I sinned in
[1:26:22] other words I knew better and I did it
[1:26:24] anyway
[1:26:25] that's iniquity that thou mightest be
[1:26:30] what jequan me against then the only
[1:26:33] have I sinned and done this evil in my
[1:26:35] sight
[1:26:35] that thou mightest be justified when
[1:26:38] thou speakest and be clear when thou
[1:26:41] judgest he knows God's going to judge
[1:26:43] him be saying God behold I was shapen in
[1:26:48] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[1:26:50] conceive me behold thou desirous truth
[1:26:55] in the inward man parts and in the
[1:26:57] hidden part thou shalt make me to know
[1:27:00] wisdom he's telling God that he's going
[1:27:03] to redeem him
[1:27:05] Rock behold thou desires truth in the
[1:27:08] inward parts and in the hidden part thou
[1:27:11] shalt make me to know wisdom purge me
[1:27:15] with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me
[1:27:19] and I shall be whiter than snow how do
[1:27:23] you think Satan's getting his anointing
[1:27:25] watch you see how God is doing this but
[1:27:29] you see this guy over here he's riding
[1:27:31] right there with him
[1:27:33] purge me with hyssop and I shall be
[1:27:35] clean wash me and I shall be whiter than
[1:27:36] snow make me to hear joy and gladness
[1:27:39] that the bones which thou has broken may
[1:27:41] rejoice hide thy face from my sins and
[1:27:45] blot out all my iniquities
[1:27:48] he's telling God I've repented and you
[1:27:53] being a just God you got to hide your
[1:27:57] face from my sins and blot out my
[1:27:59] iniquities I've done what I told you I
[1:28:01] was gonna do I repented I mean what else
[1:28:04] can we do listen folks if it's penance
[1:28:09] we're trying to do then let's just start
[1:28:11] beating each other out you know y'all
[1:28:13] beat me and I'll beat ya'll and we'll
[1:28:16] just beat each other to death we'll just
[1:28:18] have a bunch of dead people hellbound if
[1:28:21] we don't get right but you see what look
[1:28:24] honestly you see what the Catholic
[1:28:26] Church gets their doctrines is that if
[1:28:30] we can do something to appease God
[1:28:33] instead of just what Martin Luther comes
[1:28:35] out and he says the just shall live by
[1:28:38] faith not by those peanuts not by
[1:28:44] crawling on the on the ground because
[1:28:47] look David tried that to remember before
[1:28:49] before the baby died he laid out on the
[1:28:52] stones he drug yourself on the stones
[1:28:54] way cried all night
[1:28:59] hide thy face from my sins and bought
[1:29:02] out mine iniquity I hope this is helping
[1:29:03] you because look this is already in here
[1:29:05] that this is done don't put David in
[1:29:08] there I'm the same way I'm a murderer a
[1:29:10] liar thief and whoremonger I was I have
[1:29:14] that in my past but if God put it in a
[1:29:17] civics forgetfulness he's gonna go what
[1:29:23] sins they were to write a song about
[1:29:25] that what sins are you talking about
[1:29:30] right Aaron you write a few verses in
[1:29:33] that tape all right let's go to the next
[1:29:35] one Psalm 32:1 through to psalm of David
[1:29:40] my skill blessed is he whose
[1:29:41] transgression is forgiven whose sin is
[1:29:44] covered
[1:29:45] blessed is the man to whom the lord
[1:29:48] imputeth not iniquity and in whose
[1:29:53] spirit there is no guile goodness
[1:29:56] gracious
[1:29:57] psalm 32:5 i acknowledge my sin unto
[1:30:01] thee and my iniquity have I not hid so
[1:30:06] you can't hide this man's hiding we're
[1:30:13] just to be an open book but there's a
[1:30:18] way out I said I will confess my
[1:30:22] transgressions unto the Lord and thou
[1:30:24] forgave us the iniquity of my sin what's
[1:30:28] our problem he's talking to a bank slim
[1:30:32] prophet in the Old Testament
[1:30:36] remember what brother Brown says that
[1:30:38] Jesus raised on the on the prophecy of a
[1:30:41] backslidden prophet David said they'll
[1:30:42] not leave my soul in hey Lord leave I'm
[1:30:44] just telling you what the brother Graham
[1:30:45] said but X is the backslidden
[1:30:47] whoremonger and king that he what he is
[1:30:51] telling us what God's already said what
[1:30:54] God's already done that's why I believe
[1:30:57] that David is the apple of God's eye
[1:31:02] David was a human man but God knew if he
[1:31:05] could ever get in David soul he would be
[1:31:07] probably the most perfect person to ever
[1:31:08] live because of the way his attitude was
[1:31:11] toward God
[1:31:12] member brother Brent said our attitude
[1:31:14] alright so some thirty to five now let's
[1:31:18] go to Psalms 119 132 to 133 look down
[1:31:22] upon me and be merciful unto me as thou
[1:31:25] uses to do unto those that love thy name
[1:31:28] order my steps in that word and let not
[1:31:32] any iniquity have dominion over me
[1:31:36] none alright you think well I want you
[1:31:40] to tell me about the first seal we're
[1:31:42] talking about redemption what is this
[1:31:46] it's how God is look I'm gonna read you
[1:31:49] in a minute how God's gonna redeem
[1:31:51] Israel he promised them look they're
[1:31:53] sitting over there today the the
[1:31:56] Orthodox Jew saying God loves us God
[1:32:00] said he would bring us by God said we'd
[1:32:02] have this land God said don't send up
[1:32:05] there not knowing that God's already
[1:32:07] turned away from them but why can't you
[1:32:10] and I take the revelation that God has
[1:32:13] went and give us the same thing surely
[1:32:19] what goes to Israel's got to come to us
[1:32:25] they get land we get gone proverbs 16:6
[1:32:33] now how is iniquity purged now look that
[1:32:38] word purged that's what's happening in
[1:32:41] the seals God is purging us now when we
[1:32:45] were doing foreclosed home there would
[1:32:48] be water in the lines and they would
[1:32:50] want that water purged it was there we
[1:32:52] knew it was there but they didn't want
[1:32:54] it to free so we would what put pressure
[1:32:57] we'd take a we'd take a air compressor
[1:33:01] hook it up to the lines and we would
[1:33:03] purge our bloat we knew it was in there
[1:33:07] thereby getting this illustration we
[1:33:09] knew the water was in there but it had
[1:33:12] there was a way I hope you see this this
[1:33:15] is there's got to be a way to get out
[1:33:17] there's a way for that water to get all
[1:33:19] the way out turn some pressure and let
[1:33:23] it blow that line until all you see is
[1:33:25] air
[1:33:26] all you hear is air you don't see any
[1:33:27] water coming out my mercy and truth
[1:33:31] iniquity is purged and by the fear of
[1:33:35] the Lord men depart from evil that all
[1:33:38] right say ma'am Isaiah 6 verse 5 what's
[1:33:43] going to purchase mercy and truth not
[1:33:45] mercy and error or not condemnation and
[1:33:49] error mercy and truth I was there 6
[1:33:52] verse 5 then I said woe is me for I am
[1:33:54] undone this is me because I'm a man of
[1:33:57] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[1:33:59] a people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[1:34:01] have seen the king the Lord of hosts now
[1:34:04] who is this that says Isaiah in the
[1:34:06] temple all right then flew one of the
[1:34:08] seraphim's unto me having a live coal in
[1:34:11] his hand which he had taken with the
[1:34:13] tongs from off the altar and he laid it
[1:34:16] upon my mouth and said lo this has
[1:34:19] touched my lips and dine iniquity it's
[1:34:21] taken away and I since first I'm just
[1:34:28] reading you what the Lord said the coal
[1:34:32] fire put on the lips of Isaiah this have
[1:34:37] touched our lips and on iniquity is
[1:34:39] taken away and our sin purged Daniel
[1:34:44] 9:24 very familiar what's what he's
[1:34:46] going to do do you ever realize this
[1:34:48] seventy weeks are determined upon thy
[1:34:50] people and upon thy holy city to do six
[1:34:53] things now we're going to take this
[1:34:55] maybe at the very end another year from
[1:34:57] now if the rapture don't they please
[1:34:58] we're going to take these six things and
[1:35:01] we're going to put them in the six seals
[1:35:03] because remember six seals finishes
[1:35:04] Redemption not seven six six seals
[1:35:07] finishes Redemption so six the six fold
[1:35:11] purpose finishes the redemption of
[1:35:13] Israel that all right say ma'am
[1:35:15] all right seventy weeks are determined
[1:35:17] upon thy people upon my holy city to do
[1:35:19] one finish the transgression what finish
[1:35:22] it you can't burn somebody that's that's
[1:35:25] dirty make an end of sins end
[1:35:31] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:35:37] remember what he said he said the people
[1:35:40] said let his blood be on us and our
[1:35:42] children and for petrol perpetual
[1:35:43] generations that's what's happened but
[1:35:45] there's going to be a reconciling time
[1:35:47] there's going to be a time he's gonna
[1:35:48] reconcile their iniquity not remember it
[1:35:51] no more
[1:35:52] bringing everlasting righteousness seal
[1:35:54] up the vision and prophecy prophesying
[1:35:56] anoint the most holy
[1:35:57] let's go to Jeremiah 31 now watch
[1:36:03] remember remember who Jeremiah was
[1:36:05] Jeremiah was a prophet that was during
[1:36:09] the time that Israel was coming back
[1:36:11] home restoring everything getting
[1:36:14] everything coming back up watch but this
[1:36:16] shall be the Covenant that I will make
[1:36:17] with the house of Israel after those
[1:36:20] days saith the Lord I will put my law in
[1:36:22] their inward parts and write it in their
[1:36:25] hearts and will be their God and they
[1:36:28] shall be my people and they shall teach
[1:36:31] no more every man is neighbor and every
[1:36:33] man his brother saying know the Lord
[1:36:35] watch for they shall all know me in
[1:36:40] other words they're going to be an out
[1:36:41] spreading of the Holy Ghost there's
[1:36:43] going to be an out spreading of God that
[1:36:46] they're not gonna have to go to the
[1:36:48] temple to get that's what he's saying
[1:36:50] right here alright so put us in here now
[1:36:54] this is to us for they shall all know me
[1:36:58] from the least of them unto the greatest
[1:37:01] of them saith the Lord for I will
[1:37:03] forgive their iniquity and I will
[1:37:07] remember their sin no more that God's a
[1:37:11] liar if he can't got the law he can't do
[1:37:15] that but I don't think is because if he
[1:37:17] wrote it in the Bible he's able to do it
[1:37:20] and he's already done it I believe we
[1:37:22] just got to realize it Jeremiah 33 verse
[1:37:25] 7 and I will cause the captivity of
[1:37:28] Judah and the captivity of Israel to
[1:37:31] return and we'll build them as at the
[1:37:35] first no restoration Redemption he's
[1:37:37] bringing a bite and I will cleanse them
[1:37:40] from all their iniquity whereby they
[1:37:45] sin against me and I will pardon all
[1:37:49] their iniquities whereby they have
[1:37:52] sinned and whereby they have
[1:37:53] transgressed against me
[1:37:55] pretty clean people he's took their sin
[1:37:58] away he's took their iniquity away and
[1:38:01] that's Israel what about us spiritual
[1:38:07] Israel all right let's go to Jeremiah 50
[1:38:11] and in those days and in that time saith
[1:38:17] the Lord the iniquity of Israel shall be
[1:38:22] sought for and there shall be none in
[1:38:29] other words Satan's gonna say don't you
[1:38:34] remember you told them not he said I
[1:38:39] don't let us in there I say no you say
[1:38:44] it that way you didn't hear me right I
[1:38:45] said look I said the iniquity of Israel
[1:38:47] shall be sought for and there shall be
[1:38:48] none and the sins of Judah and they
[1:38:53] shall not be found for I will pardon
[1:38:56] them whom I reserved Ezra 9 and after
[1:39:04] the watch now remember as remember he
[1:39:07] was the blushing prophet and watch him
[1:39:10] talk about Israel and I highlighted this
[1:39:13] cuz I want you to put this is exactly in
[1:39:16] the age that we're living in
[1:39:18] all right cuz it's at the evening
[1:39:21] sacrifice now why would it be at the
[1:39:23] evening sacrifice if it wasn't any in
[1:39:24] time the evening time and that the
[1:39:27] evening sacrifice I rose up from my
[1:39:29] heaviness and have rent my Garmin and my
[1:39:32] mantle
[1:39:35] and I fell upon my knees and spread out
[1:39:37] my hands into the Lord my god
[1:39:40] an ice and said oh my god I am ashamed
[1:39:43] and blush to lift up my face to thee my
[1:39:48] god now there's a prophet that seeing
[1:39:51] the iniquity of Israel turning against
[1:39:55] God putting up idols left the homeland
[1:39:57] tore everything down and Ezra and
[1:40:00] Nehemiah ng them are trying to hurt him
[1:40:02] back into the Promised Land right all
[1:40:04] right just think about that you see
[1:40:05] sometimes you have to put yourself in
[1:40:07] Ezra's place he was blessing good I
[1:40:10] don't know I can't even I can't even
[1:40:12] talk to you anymore because but watch
[1:40:14] what God said and said oh my god I am
[1:40:18] ashamed and blush to lift up my face to
[1:40:20] thee my god for our iniquities are
[1:40:22] increased over our head and our
[1:40:25] trespasses grown up unto the heavens
[1:40:28] looks like a total impossibility that
[1:40:30] we're ever going to get back since the
[1:40:34] days of our fathers have we been in a
[1:40:36] great trespass unto this day
[1:40:40] now I say from the beginning of the
[1:40:43] church ages because really in the church
[1:40:47] ages remember there was no doctrinal
[1:40:49] issues until the church age has started
[1:40:51] because remember Satan inject itself
[1:40:53] into the church age right because there
[1:40:57] was no look because look come back to
[1:40:58] here there was no doctrine in these
[1:41:00] first three Church ages the doctrine
[1:41:03] started developing in these ages
[1:41:09] since the days of our fathers have we
[1:41:11] been in a great trespass until this day
[1:41:14] and for our iniquities have we our Kings
[1:41:19] our preachers our preachers been
[1:41:26] delivered into the hands of the kings of
[1:41:28] the lands money whipping women
[1:41:31] popularity to the sword to captive into
[1:41:34] a spoil and to confusion of face as it
[1:41:38] is this day same thing right here
[1:41:41] Ezra could sit in free could be here
[1:41:44] five minutes and he'd go I said that
[1:41:46] about 5,000 years ago you're sitting in
[1:41:49] the same place but watch and now for a
[1:41:52] little space Grace has been showed from
[1:41:57] the Lord our God about how to kick and
[1:42:00] fit when I sitting there reading this
[1:42:01] one this was one of the last ones and I
[1:42:02] thought man this is you and I to leave
[1:42:06] us a remnant to escape to give us a nail
[1:42:11] in this holy place that our God may what
[1:42:14] give us revelation lighten our eyes and
[1:42:19] give us a little reviving in our bondage
[1:42:22] man let's read some 103 I guess it
[1:42:28] didn't excite you like it didn't me but
[1:42:31] to me I see the redemption to now
[1:42:33] through all every scripture you read you
[1:42:36] see Redemption that's all you want to
[1:42:38] see his Redemption how God's going to
[1:42:41] redeem Israel redeem us redeem the world
[1:42:43] everything's got to be redeemed because
[1:42:45] we were caught in this mystery of
[1:42:47] iniquity with no way out
[1:42:51] because the member ffetzer if it's a
[1:42:53] mystery it's been hit if it's been
[1:42:55] hidden you can't figure out how to get
[1:42:57] out of it but since these sails have
[1:43:00] opened what brother Brown say the Bible
[1:43:02] became a brand new book now I'm not
[1:43:03] telling you brother Brant read these
[1:43:05] same scriptures and thought the same way
[1:43:06] I did but I'll guarantee you he saw
[1:43:08] redemption in every scripture that he
[1:43:10] read a psalm of David blessed the Lord O
[1:43:13] my soul and all that is within me he
[1:43:17] ought to write a song about them bless
[1:43:19] His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul
[1:43:22] and forget not all his benefits who
[1:43:27] forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[1:43:31] healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth
[1:43:35] thy life from destruction think about
[1:43:38] this who crown a--they with
[1:43:40] loving-kindness he's not talking about
[1:43:42] this crown right here he's talking about
[1:43:45] who crown us them with loving-kindness
[1:43:47] and tender mercies who satisfies thy
[1:43:51] mouth with good things so that thy youth
[1:43:54] is renewed like the Eagle body
[1:44:01] body change last thing who satisfies thy
[1:44:05] mouth with good things out of thy mouth
[1:44:07] with for what rivers of living water so
[1:44:10] that thy youth is renewed like the Eagle
[1:44:14] this is redemption redemption redemption
[1:44:19] there is no way we could have got out
[1:44:21] had they not we have not been able to
[1:44:24] see the separation of that wild horse
[1:44:28] rider riding off now remember he keeps
[1:44:30] riding on that old God gets off of one
[1:44:33] and he jumps on another one and we're
[1:44:36] going to get in there in a little while
[1:44:37] but next Sunday
[1:44:38] we want to talk about justification
[1:44:42] because you ought to see now there was a
[1:44:46] group of people justified in the Bible
[1:44:48] amen and I'm included in that group
[1:44:53] sure Israel my even Eve's going to be
[1:44:57] restored even eating is going to be
[1:44:59] restored how they'll be restored
[1:45:01] iniquity is going to be destroyed
[1:45:07] and housing will be destroyed by
[1:45:11] revelation of something previously hid
[1:45:15] and now being made known let's stand our
[1:45:20] feet
[1:45:22] Amen something previously hid that's
[1:45:25] been right here in this Bible that we
[1:45:30] keep reading and reading and we swear
[1:45:34] that they put another chapter in
[1:45:36] something because we never read that
[1:45:38] before all these things if he's if he
[1:45:51] did that to a backslidden Israel what
[1:45:54] about you and I folks listens where what
[1:45:59] that Old Testament talked about where
[1:46:02] watch that blessing prophet he wasn't
[1:46:05] talking to Israel he was talking to me
[1:46:07] and you thank your brother
[1:46:09] he went dogging Israel surely was a
[1:46:11] prophet to Israel but in the evening
[1:46:14] sacrifice in the latter part of the day
[1:46:17] that's us the day of the Lord were at
[1:46:22] the end time were at the evening
[1:46:24] sacrifice Elijah at the evening
[1:46:27] sacrifice all those that they evening
[1:46:30] sacrifice this is the evening time later
[1:46:37] than you think
[1:46:38] amen but that mystery of iniquity how to
[1:46:43] destroy it is written right here
[1:46:46] but it took a prophet to open our eyes
[1:46:48] so that we could see you see because
[1:46:53] look he never read any of them scripture
[1:46:55] he broke the seal a prophet has to get
[1:46:58] it straight from God listen there's
[1:47:00] nobody can correct William Branham it's
[1:47:02] God and brother Branham and all of us
[1:47:04] minions down here below and I'm telling
[1:47:07] you we we ain't got to this spot in the
[1:47:09] word yet you got it but there was nobody
[1:47:11] between God and brother Branham nobody
[1:47:13] he got it straight from God and he give
[1:47:16] it to us and look at the mess we're in
[1:47:19] the mystery of iniquity still works
[1:47:23] until he what he be taken out of the way
[1:47:27] till you and I are takin out of the way
[1:47:29] listen we're stopping Israel's
[1:47:31] Redemption there's look honestly there's
[1:47:35] no progression over there of the word
[1:47:37] now there's the old timers there's the
[1:47:41] Orthodox Jew that keep reading the Torah
[1:47:43] and keep reading the Torah and keep
[1:47:45] reading remember they don't have Matthew
[1:47:47] Mark Luke and John and I they don't late
[1:47:49] that didn't happen sure they study it
[1:47:51] for commentaries but that didn't happen
[1:47:53] they're looking to Ezra they're looking
[1:47:56] to Jeremiah's promises that I will Joel
[1:48:00] I will restore they're saying oh that's
[1:48:02] us but remember God already left that
[1:48:08] now it's us you and I or the bride of
[1:48:13] Jesus Christ they had their time they
[1:48:16] had their time they had their
[1:48:17] opportunity but remember they didn't
[1:48:21] know how to get out and you and I know
[1:48:22] how to get out you and I know how to get
[1:48:25] out of this mess because of what God's
[1:48:27] already brought us let's sing a song if

[1:51:09] you believe God sent Elijah to you he
[1:51:15] sent you Elijah to tell you these things
[1:51:19] now remember he's the porter that stands
[1:51:22] and opens the door he was the Eleazar
[1:51:25] that that that got Rebecca and Isaac
[1:51:28] together but remember he ain't going to
[1:51:32] tent three's a crowd amen
[1:51:37] but he told Rebecca so much about Isaac
[1:51:42] till she didn't have an Instagram photo
[1:51:45] of him but when she got close enough she
[1:51:49] saw a characteristic like she had been
[1:51:51] told
[1:51:54] Eliezer preached for 1,100 sermons to
[1:51:59] tell them what their eyes is going to be
[1:52:02] when they see him and when she got up
[1:52:05] she lighted off the camel she didn't
[1:52:07] just get off and go now she knew who he
[1:52:10] was by the LEDs are they told her about
[1:52:14] everything about his characteristic and
[1:52:17] she absolutely knew who he was but you
[1:52:22] know what's wonderful brother Branham
[1:52:24] was a little bit different in that
[1:52:26] because he was he le s AR but he was
[1:52:30] also Rebecca

[1:52:35] he was the one that introduced and he's
[1:52:38] the one that even was introduced to talk
[1:52:41] to but he was part of the bride so he
[1:52:45] did get to go into ten but not as
[1:52:47] Ellie's are he went in his wife the
[1:52:50] bride of Jesus Christ

[1:53:08] something with it he knew Abraham would
[1:53:11] talk to his generation he knew you and I
[1:53:14] would talk to the people tell him the
[1:53:17] truth
[1:53:18] not a lot cuz the lies that mystery of
[1:53:22] iniquity that's a lie at first still had
[1:53:28] to open and when he did it pulled back
[1:53:31] the pages of heaven and let man see
[1:53:34] things they'd never seen before
