always see amen god bless you tonight you can be seated for a minute i'm not going to sing so y'all can have your seats appreciate the lord and all of his blessings on us i uh i want to give a little of a bit of a testimony and actually a couple of testimonies let's take a few minutes and tell you about some things and i'll give you a little update i uh a few weeks ago uh the end of last month i asked for prayer for a little boy named nahum meisters or our neighbors or we went to school with his mom richard and i did when we were years ago in north carolina and uh he's palm sunday name had a he was on a swing that was on a limb and the limb broke and hit him in the head and he had severe brain trauma and you know he was in bad shape and uh they had to life flight him to charlotte and uh just the the lord just moved on the scene for him and that's nahum and his mom her name's sunshine and then there's another picture of him brother joe's got that's him but when they thought when they got him to charlotte they got him to the children's hospital in charlotte the doctors were trying to prepare sunshine and her husband todd for the fact that nahum may not make it and so it's just been a burden on my heart but i just want to thank the lord to not he's doing better he is as you can see he's he's awake now he's uh still got a long way to go but uh sunshine and if if y'all want to y'all can see i got some of the posts on my facebook page if you want to see it sunshine's got all the on her facebook page but uh it was it was you know when things like this happen you start to wonder why you know why this happened and you know where's god in all of this and you know you know uh you try to have faith in god and it's like whether you know all everything's stacked against you but the thing is is god is a very present help in the time of trouble his name's nahum and is his mom said the lord gave her a scripture nahum 1 7 says the lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him that's what struck me is it's nahum 1 7. he's six years old and if you go from one to seven that's six numbers and seven is the number of completions so i believe he's gonna be okay just just give you a few run down they had to life flight him out to charlotte and one of the paramedics came by saw sunshine and told her said we didn't think we was going to be able to fly that day because the storm was coming in and we only had a 20-minute window to get the helicopter off the ground and said we didn't think we'd ever get off the ground but the lord held a storm off so they got in the air and uh there was a she tells the story about that one of the paramedics was a combat medic in either iraq or afghanistan and was uh was on the scene and she had been contemplating cutting back the number of hours that she worked and she hadn't and she just couldn't figure out why she just wasn't comfortable with that but she said that day she said i realized she said if i hadn't if i had cut my hours back she said i wouldn't been there that day when nahin got hurt and so you know you look at things like that god's always got people he always works everything out perfect but she was uh she'd been talking to him and they took him off all of the sedation and he hadn't opened his eyes or responded in any way and she was just in there talking to him and singing to him and everything and one day he opened his eyes and she was talking to him and he turned his head toward her and so she knew that he was there later on she said that they were talking to him the doctors were giving him the prognosis and what his treatment was going to be later on and she said i was in there holding his hand and the doctors were talking to me and she said i realized that i wasn't holding his hand he was holding my hand so she knew something the lord was working on him and and so when she told him what had happened after he had his eyes open one day she was talking to him he'll realize she told him what was going on he began to cry and he began to get fearful and she said that was the first time that she had a response from him that he like a like a six-year-old would he was scared of what was going what was taking place and she said she realized that he's there with her but he's in and out a lot and but he's been able to open his mouth and follow some commands at different times and they were cleaning his mouth out one day and said his head fell forward and she put it put her hand on his head and he was trying to raise his head back up so he's he's conscious some to know what was going on but it's just every little thing like that you just praise god for so and uh you know we went to school with them and then there's many other ones that did too so uh what amazes me and what blesses me is every time i go in there and we see all the updates is how many message believers because she went to school with message believers going to christian school she taught in a christian school and she taught message believers and their children and everything so there's a lot of message believers and so there's been a lot of the bride of jesus christ been praying for nahum and so just thank the lord you know god puts us in in a pathway and we don't know why but you know there were people talking about sunshine and what a blessing she had been and everything and the other day i was thinking you know the bible says cast your bread upon the waters and it'll it'll return to you so we never know why we cross people's paths but you know sometimes god has a greater plan we don't see but i thank the lord for him touching him and y'all just continue to pray for him and we just believe that one day he'll be old so and i about a year and a half to two years ago i had a as a man at work he's a good christian man but uh he come to me one day and asked me said i won't talk to you for a minute i said sure so we were off and he began to talk to me about some things that was going on in the plant and he said i he said i didn't just ask anybody he said i asked people that i had confidence in their prayers and he said i want you to pray about it so i did so we started praying i got prayer claws and i took them to work put them in the plant for the last two and a half you know year and a half two years we hadn't seen anything change it just seemed like that but i want to thank the lord today that the last few weeks we've really started seeing changes take place things started changing and you know it's just you you ever you know we talk about it in different times we you say you look at things and you wonder you know you pray for things and then when things happen you're shocked that they happen and sometimes when they when they happen you know because you see something and it's been so long that you've been waiting on this that you that you're actually thinking you know this april fools or you know it's like you know it's a shock to you it's like am i really seeing this but to begin to see the things that's taken place and it's just amazing how god works and you know you just stand faithful and i had i totally it was so i i talked about you know praying and praying and this morning i was on the roof working on some stuff and the lord reminded me he said do you remember those prayer claws you put out in here and i had totally forgot about all of them until that moment the lord brought it back to me said you put those prayer clothes there since you've been waiting so i thank the lord and uh i also told brother bob i've been been waiting on getting uh getting a promotion for a while and getting getting a pay raise and it's uh it made it halfway through the process and it never got any further and it's been they've been dragging their feet for a while and everybody's like well you know we've been trying to we've been trying to help you out trying to get it's like you know i didn't worry about it anymore i just put it in the hands of the lord and i just want to thank the lord it finally did come through they finally quit dragging their feet but you know it comes in god's time not in our time so so i just want to thank the lord for that tonight those all blessings come from him amen so let's all stand and sleep and we're going to go to psalms 34. back when we were what we were looking at before psalms 34 verse 1 and i want to talk about as we talked about last time it was talking about eating so we're going to be talking about eating again so we're going to talk about taste and see that the lord is good because the lord is good you know sometimes we don't know why things go but you know god works it out perfectly in his in his time amen so let's all bow our heads we'll just speak to the author and then we'll read the scripture our heavenly father we thank you for this time lord to be in your house again lord we're just so thankful lord for all that you've done for us father we see how you work and lord sometimes we it takes a while and we sometimes we wonder why it takes so long or what's going on but you but your prophet told us lord that sight and time was a bit of a hindrance that that was had to the plan of god and you know we get our we get so worried about things but if we just have simple childlike faith and put our trust in you lord and just leave it in your hands lord we know that you will work it out and father we just pray tonight that you come and lord speak to us tonight through your word and we just pray that you bless the reading of the word lord and everything that is said father just give me the words to speak to the people lord let it not be my thoughts lord let it be your thoughts and father we just pray that you touch each one that has a need here tonight father for the ones that are watching in lord the ones i'll be watching later lord for each one lord for your bride around the world there's many that have needs lord that need touch and the body and lord need financial help and all the different ones lord i just pray that you minister to each one lord you know what they have need of and just bless in a special way bless our service tonight lead us in god us and all things that we ask in the name of jesus christ amen amen psalms 34 verse 1 says i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad well magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto me and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the lord is in the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them that fear him amen so god bless you tonight that's the end amen amen y'all have your seats god bless you amen but uh last time we were speaking on talking about the scripture we were last time talking about the uh began to talk about the manna that fell in the wilderness and how god gave to the people what they had need of and it was perfect for their time and you know even though it was it was perfect and it was exactly what they needed you know the people began to murmur and complain about it you know there was a there was a conditions on what they had to do to to to harvest or or reap the the manna that fell every day and you know they couldn't hold it over but they had to go out every morning and get it and you know and it becomes such a a common thing but it was a a supernatural event that took place in their lives and you know they began to murmur and complain to moses about what was taking place and you know god was blessing them but they didn't see it as a blessing but you know god told moses to tell aaron and he went out and told aaron he said you take up an omer of this manna and he said you put it in in the holies of holies there with the ark of the covenant and he said you know you you store this up and it was a memorial it was a covenant unto the people and that every generation beyond that every priest that came to the came to into the priesthood was able to eat of that original manna and so they were able to go in and that manna was in there in the manna as in the beginning the manna would rot if they if they tried to hold it over but when it came into the shekinah glory in there with the ark of the covenant then it lasted forever and it never did cease and it never it never rotted and it never went out but it was always full of of the of manna that was in there and so every time that they would go in there they were able to get exactly what they had need of and you know when you when you look at the ark of the covenant you know it's called the ark of the testament and you know it was a testimony because in the scripture god tells moses he says no this will be a covenant this is going to be a testimony to the people see the people were the ones that broke god's word they didn't believe god it wasn't that god wasn't faithful to them they weren't faithful to what he believed and you know when you go back into the scripture and you and you read the scripture that you know they were the ones that god told them what to do and how to do it and you know and he told them that when you're coming up and you're on this journey he said you know you follow what what i tell you to do and what moses is going to tell you to do and you know but they began to get lacks and they began to get cold and what was going to take what was taking place and they wanted to do their own thing and they couldn't ever get egypt out of their mind and out of their view but they never could get in view what god had in store for them and you know here they are when when god began to talk and and you know they were afraid because moses had spent so much time in the mountain getting the law and god was speaking to moses and and giving the word and they were so laxin and their in their uh behavior and their and their doings that they didn't even care that you know they began to worship idols and you know they had the golden calf and began to act just like all the people that were around them and just began to act like you know so like worldly and everything and they didn't even care about what god was doing that god was trying to lead them and in the midst of all that you know moses got mad and he took the he took the tablets and he broke the you know he broke them on the our of the uh golden calf and you know then he had him crush it and then you know you added it to the water and made them drink it you know because and then god took him back on the mountain and he gave him another writing of the law and he brought the other law down to him and you know and then he put that in the ark of the covenant and that ark when it stayed in the ark of the covenant see that was a testimony why because every single time that they looked upon the law those tablets that laid in there that was a rebuke to the people because the original ones were broke because they were out worshiping idols and so here they are they had this one and then when when they when they were in the wilderness and they lacked food and they were you know worried about how they were going to get through and what god was going to do to them and how god was going to take care of them and they were so regarding regarding god how that how they just were so disrespectful and didn't have faith in what god was trying to do for him and not honoring god and their in their their uh work and conduct everything that they've done and here they are god was trying to feed on manna and they and they failed to believe what god had to do you know every time even when they needed water everything that they had need of god met their needs and he took that omer and he put it in the ark of the covenant and that was because it was a testimony against them it was a testimony that god was faithful to them but it was a testimony to them it was rebuked to them because they did not believe and when he took when he took aaron's rod it was because they did not believe that god had called aaron and the levites to be the priest and to the position that they were in that they did not respect and believe what god had told them and so he made the test and he told him he said okay that's fine he said each man each tribe has a rod and they were supposed to put it in the shekinah glory and he said then what it'll prove to you why because each tribe had to bring their own stick they had to bring their own rod and he said you have to write your name on it and so they placed it in the in the holy of holies in there and then god came down and he he manifested and so he uh he uh chose showing the people which one that he had chosen was that it was aaron that he had received him and so he uh caused the rod to bloom and bring forth almonds to prove to the people that that was god's choice because each one of them had brought a dead rod in there and there was no life in it why because they had handled it they knew what that it was dead they knew what it was they put their name on it so they knew that it was dead and there was no no you know it wasn't some kind of cheap magician's trick but it had to be the supernatural take place and it budded and it blossomed and it brought forth those almonds and you know what when it was stayed in the in the ark of the covenant you know what it never did lose its almonds it never did lose the blooms all of that stayed right there why because it was a rebuke to the people but it was a testimony to god to the people that god was true to what he said he was going to do and every time that the people wanted to come against god you know he always rose up and he always tried to show to the people and prove to the people what he was going to do when every time they asked him he was always faithful to them he never was against them they were always against him they couldn't keep their mind on on the right thing and they couldn't keep their eye on the journey and they're overcoming because they were so tied up with all the things that was taking place all around them but so so when all of this took place then when god when they come to kalish barnea then it come to the final judgment they had to come up and make a decision whether they were going to go over or not and when all that god had done through you know taking care of them and nobody was sick and their clothes didn't wear out and all the things that god had done through them and they show god showed them all the way through how faithful he was and he made a witness to them with the with the pillar of fire and the cloud and everything that took place the brazen serpent everything that took place god was faithful to them and they failed to believe what he had to say and so when it come to that place then judgment came on them why because that was all god could do god can only bring you so far and then you face judgment and so that's what happened they come to a place that when they when they gave up then that's all god can do he said he told him he said your carcasses will rot out here in the wilderness he said but your children he said your little ones who you think will be a prey he said they will rise up and go in and take the land so he rebuked them but you know he he brought them all the way and he tried to show them what exactly what was what he was trying to do and he was faithful to him the whole way and brothers and sisters god is faithful to us he's always been faithful to us but the problem is is do we believe do we have our s are our minds set do we have our hearts that do are we completely sold out to what god has done have we so completely sold out to god's plan so each time as we were talking last time each time the priest came to age and was able to enter in to the priesthood then he was able to go back in there and eat that eat a part of that original manna you know what a what a wonderful time that you know when this man was able and and had went through all of his training and all the things that he had went through in his life he come to this place and then he was able to take part of this supernatural this this amazing thing that was there that that you know you know because many times you know it was just something hey we talked about these things and and we've heard about these things but you know all of a sudden it become psyched it became is really a reality to him that he was able not only to sin but he was able to taste that and you know and then you know begin to put into your mind those all of our ancestors they were back there and god brought them out to us through a strong hand and he brought them through all these miracles and he brought them all this way and you know what they failed to believe they failed to come in and they are eating that be able to eat that manna what a wonderful thing that to be able to eat that but you know brother brother brown talked about you know that in time you know when when jesus came and died and the veil was rent then we know that that the access was open it was not just to just to the priests back then as as the veil was closed and everything was shut off but when the veil was written too then there was access to everyone because through the through the new birth and the the body of christ as we come into the body of christ then we all have access to that and so when you enter into that then there's always access to that manna that word of god is always available and so it was just so not like back then where you could only come at a certain time or whatever but now it's day night whenever and we can come boldly before the throne and we always have access to the word because now we've all became priests and kings before god that we could all have access and so now we all can partake of this manna so the word of god has been open to us that we all are able to partake of this man this supernatural word that god has blessed us with but like he said you couldn't hold over you can't hold over you know because you know there was a message that was in the past and every every ages had it has had its message and god has blessed each one but you know when it come to our day then you know god has opened up everything in our day you know you know the opening of the word is coming our day and you know you know so many people as you know they've probed and and and tried to understand things and you know they they could only see just a portion because god had allotted a portion to each one but praise god in our day god has opened the word to us that we can see what god has done in the past and we understand these things but we understand what god has done in our day that god has opened up the full word that we're we're not we're not trying to trying to figure things out or or trying to have guests work or you know trying to take educated guesses or anything but you know we've heard god speaking our day and you know what he began to answer the questions that were in the scripture that were hidden all the way through the ages and that other ones could only probe at or they could only look at it but you know then god began to open these things up and now we can see that that the full revelation has come in our day but the thing is it's the same thing the manna has fallen but the problem is is do the people want to come and receive see the the manna has fallen so the word of god has been opened but the problem is is you he can only put the manna out there but the problem is is do you want to receive it you've got to come and receive from it and then we begin to talk about you know receiving the word you know when when the angel told john he said come and go eat the book and he said you know he said give me the book so you know he had to go up there and he had to tell to take the book from the angel but had to tell him i'm going to take the book give me the book but he just couldn't take the book he had to eat the book he had to become the book so when he began to eat the book then he began to work inside of him so the thing is brother sisters that's what we have to do we have to eat the word we have to take on the word receive the word to become the word and you become the word as you receive the word and so this is our day to receive the word not just to say that god sent a prophet in our day and god has opened these things but the thing is is when when we have you know 11 1200 sermons and and we have we have it in every kind of form of media that you can think of and you know people still don't want to take time to listen and you know everybody you know and it's just like you you can't just cherry pick what you want you know we just don't have we don't because when he said you had to eat the whole book then you know it wasn't just we're going to leave it a little bit out here we're going to trim the crust off for whatever you know we're going to eat this so what no we got to take the whole book we got to take all of it and so you know we we can look in and try to you know uh take our portion and and you know try to put a little slant on it this way or that way but you know what that's not ever gonna that will only produce death the only thing that's gonna produce life he said man shall not live by bread alone he said but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and so it's every word that god has spoken in our day and that's the only thing that's going to bring you eternal life because you know many people you know they just want to take what they want and they just want to leave the rest of it but let me tell you brothers and sisters if you're going to leave something behind you'll be left behind you will not make it through because if you plan on going in a rapture you better make sure that you have all of it you have all of it that you have walked in everything that god has told you to walk in and it showed in the light god has showed you because you know what everybody thinks we're in a race against somebody else we're not in a race against anybody brothers and sisters you've got to be faithful i have to be faithful to what god called me i can't be anybody else you can't be anybody else but we've got to be faithful to the call gifts and callings are without repentance but the calling that we've received in our day we have to be faithful to that calling god has called us and so i'm not trying to be somebody else and i don't want anybody else to and god help anybody try to be me but let's be let's just be what god called us to that's be i don't want to be nobody else i want to be what god's called me to be let's be let's be faithful you know so many people so many people you know they spend all their time looking at other people they're looking around and they're saying well you know you know what about this one or what about that one and you know it's it's we get our eyes so many on so many other things you know as paul said you know laying aside all those weights and the sin that so easily beset us let us run this race god has called us to a race to run but so many people have got their eyes on everything else their their peripheral vision is so full of things that they don't realize what are you actually focused on what are you focused on then we need to focus on what god has called us to let's be faithful to that we need we need to be faithful we need to because god didn't call us to be in every every place and and and do all these things god called us to be one place you know how do you plan on being if god called us to be soldiers if you're if you're a soldier in the army of god if god's called you to a place you know tell me anywhere brother donnie was in in service and i don't i don't know anybody else in here was served but i know brother donnie was but you know when they assign you to a place they assign you to one place and you got one leader and you ain't and they ain't got nobody that just you know they're they're a hopscotch runny you know easter bunny running all over the place jumping from here to wall you know everything no they got one place to be you've got one place and you and you that's that's your place that you you're in this cr you know company or platoon or whatever and you're you're assigned to this division or whatever and you're you're you've got so everybody when they come looking for you they know exactly where you're at why because they just follow the line in the hierarchy and that's oh they're they're they know exactly where you are well see the thing is is everybody wants to be wishy-washy and they and they want to run here and there and do all you know how is it how are you supposed to be in the army of god when you know when you don't it don't even make sense he's like you know everybody well you know i ain't happy in this church i'm going over here ain't happy in this church i go over there i ain't happy there i'm over there you know there's bounce around here yonder everybody what church are they in this week or wherever they at and it's like well you know what now i don't even go to church at all we're in the mystical body of christ so we're just we're just going to sit at home you know it's how how is that because all through the scripture there is always a divine order well you know there's always then how is it that you know well i don't i don't have to fit in i mean even the prophet said that brother neville was his pastor talking about brother neville brother neville you know well i'm not going to sit under nobody you know there's i'm sorry to tell you but you know there's no lone rangers in the gospel everybody wants to be you know they want to be all on their own and you know they're going to do it their own way well you know what you you're just playing games you're not you're not actually because you know what there's a divine order because you know what everybody has to have headship and so if you're going to if you're going to be and grow because you watch people there's always they they people can know the quotes and that you know you can have all the pictures you can you can be full ahead knowledge but the problem is somewhere the way light's going to cross your path and you know what you're going to turn the word down because people struggle with that to understand you know what i have to have a pastor unless you're a pastor you've got to have a pastor that's the only way that you're going gonna make it i'm sorry i'm sorry everybody thinks they're gonna be superman and they can do whatever they want to you know they got it all figured out no you don't there's a divine order to how these things gonna take place and you know what because he said the scripture tells us ephesians 4 tells us that it's going to take a five-fold ministry that it's going to take a 5-0 ministry for the perfecting of the saints and without a pastor and without a five-fold ministry to perfect you i don't care what you say you can stand up and say well the holy ghost is going to perfect me well it's going to take you because let me tell you brothers and sisters if you don't have confidence in man then how are you going to trust what god is saying people talk about oh i have faith to move mountains i have faith i have all the all kinds of faith i can do but you know what you don't have faith to believe that god can speak through another human man you're like he can speak through the human flesh you don't believe that the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost that that fell as cloven tongues upon 120 and peter and then began to come out and speak the word and begin to point back to what was spoken by the prophet joel and began to express all the way through exactly what jesus told them that would take place then you don't believe that that same holy ghost can speak through a man today because you know what we're just going to stand back and we're just going to play and we're just going to get behind our little shield and stand back here and we're going to say well i'm just going to listen to the prophet well you know what there's part of what the prophet had to say that you don't have to we just move that to the side i'm i'm sorry but you know it's it's sad because you know people do not realize what what god has blessed them with in this hour and people do not want to receive that because all they want to do is point back and say would you see that brother over there he failed that brother over there he preached false doctrine that brother over there he done this and that's all they want to do they just want to look at scarecrows but you know when you want to point them back to some brother that stood behind the pulpit and has preached the word and god has ever had to step back and make corrections of what he had to say and he's always stood there and been faithful for 40 years nobody wants to listen to that because you know what they don't they don't have any confidence in that oh no he's just he's just intellectual or he's just this but you know what they don't want to say hey you know what god has been faithful and spoken to somebody and you know then they you know that's you know they just want to duck their head and you know no i don't i don't look i don't talk about them but let me tell you something you know what this is this is a late hour and you've got to have confidence in what god has said and you know the the prophet never contradicted what this bible had to say this this book right here is what's going to get you through and you know what brother branham didn't come up with his own ideas brother madam didn't just come up with something out of some fairy tale or whatever but you know what he the angel of the lord began to speak to him and the lord showed him what was in this book right here and he began to open it up the problem is is you and i've got to get in the same spirit we've got to get into the same anointing that that he was under that he can come and speak to us so we can receive exactly what he spoke because many people they said well i you know brother battle was confused here and he was wrong here and he got this all mixed up whatever the problem is is they're not under the same anointing they're not because if you're born again if you receive the new birth then the the anointing that you have the the life that's inside of you that came on the day of pentecost that takes up residence inside of you then you know then you know what i can have confidence in that right you know i can have you know because if it's the same life it's the same life that lived in jesus and if he takes up residence in me then you know what i don't put faith in flesh i'm not putting faith in this flesh i'm not putting faith in flesh i have a fivefold ministry a man why because god resides there and there's a gift been placed in there an eternal predestinated gift that's been placed in there for god to speak to us and you know then i can trust that god spoke because you know what if they had an eternal predestinated gift of a man that came that was born in 1906 or 1909 in kentucky and everybody talks about well you know we've had god in our day that stood in flesh they came and was born in the log cabin in 1909 little man then he came and he had very little education he come out of the backwoods and all these things and we look at his life and everybody talks about the things but you know god had us had a supernatural gift in this man's life and he began to speak and he began to confound all of the intellectuals of the day and he began to take the things that came out of the scripture that was preached so many years that people's been preaching and looking at and he began to bring these things out and he went right back to the scripture went right back to the old testament and he began to bring those things right out of the old testament and just like paul when paul was there and went back on the back side of the desert was back there and he studied all of those years he began to study the old testament but when the holy ghost came then he began to read the book a brand new book and he began to see those things that were written in the old testament and he began to bring them through and he began to show that jesus christ was all through the old testament and he began to show jesus christ in our day well then when brother branham came he went right back to the old testament he picked up the old testament showed paul exactly what paul preached was exactly what was in the old testament so when he went beyond the curtain of time and he came back he said i preached exactly what paul preached why because he started in the same place that paul did and he just came all the way through and when he came in our day and began to preach exactly what paul preached why because he began to open up the word because it was the same foundation that was in the beginning and he began to build on that so if it's if it's the same if it's the same one again it's the same one today well i can have confidence in there but see the problem is is people people don't don't receive the new birth they don't they don't get to the place where they they can have confidence in god because you know if you have the same spirit that he had then you he said he will lead you and guide you into all truth so we can have confidence in what god said all the way through the bible from genesis to revelation but the problem is is we've got to dig into that we've got we've got to search and and lay before god until he gives it to us many people you know they're just they're just hunting quotes but the problem is it's just like i was thinking the other day know you see people they get so tied up and and all these things and you know they've read all these things oh i've read that oh i've read that i've read that but you know i was thinking about years ago i i read the message the masterpiece and it's been i don't know 25 26 i don't know exactly how many years it's been a long time but i just i just and it's the first time i can remember hear this that's happening to me i i just finished reading the message the masterpiece and i was watching a video somebody had had loaned me and it was brother harold hildebrand preaching and he was actually preaching the message the masterpiece and he began to preach and he began to open things and say things and i was like i don't remember reading that i don't remember and it was so amazing because i went got the book while i was watching the video i stopped and it was like oh yeah and i began to read and all of a sudden all these things that i had read you know all of a sudden i'd missed these things and things all of a sudden then all of a sudden it become clear there were things that began to open up it's like well i didn't i mean you read it but it didn't become a reality it didn't all of a sudden it was like wow that that stands out but because you begin to see things but it takes the holy ghost to do that and if he was like oh no i'm just going to get it all on my own you know but i can tell by my own experience how god has blessed me through the fivefold ministry so amen but god wants us god has called us to a place god wants us to get into the word but you know god has given us men to lead us and i thank god because god has given me and you know everybody has to find their own place you've got to find who because brother brown said god give you a pastor that'll lead you and guide you you've got to find a place that's right for you you've got to find your place so you know i i i found my place i ain't worried about nobody else y'all got y'all got to find your own place you know i'm i'm i'm here and i'm brother dale's problem so amen so amen praise the lord well you know brother dale said one time years ago he said you know you know they uh you know if he's in the army he said they always give the really toughest sergeant he'd always give them the ones that were the toughest to deal with right it's always the tough nuts and all the problem they give them the hardest well praise the lord he got it that's all right we're going to make it that's right lord knew i needed more rapture and faith than the rest of you so god put me in the right place to get more rapture in faith so but god's called us to this place god wants us to get into the word god wants us to be the word god wants us to find our place and god wants wants to reveal himself to us but the thing is is you've got to you've got to have that desire you've got to have that place you've got to get in there and and and feed on the word that th that the word that you can become the word and as he said you know you've got to go out there and you've got to get that manna but god's given us the manner but are you going to eat the man are you going are you going to eat the book because god has called us on a path god called us on our journey to a certain place that god wants us to be you know as we were talking last time you know when when we're talking about elijah and you know the widow woman and you know how how the condition that the widow woman had gotten into and you know here was elijah sitting by the brook and the ravens were feeding him and he was drinking from the from the uh brook cherith as he sat there and you know he was enjoying himself and having a quiet time and she was down there struggling in the town trying to figure out how she's going to feed her and her son and they would you know just become to get so worried and all these problems but you know she didn't realize that god had had a plan god had already provided for her but you know what she didn't realize that the the way that had been provided she just didn't see it and then and god tells elijah when he's sitting out there he said i've prepared a widow woman to sustain you that she couldn't even sustain herself she was all con worried and confused and all these things but you know god god had his prophet setting up there and just relaxing and and going through until the brook dried up and then god sent him down there to her and he began to speak the word to him and when he began to speak the word to her here she was in the midst of a famine and all these things that was going on and he said give me a drink and you know she was and she was willing to give him a drink of water and a famine and she'd be and she was willing and then he said well make me a cake and that stopped her in her tracks but you know he told her said you know she because she said listen we're going to die we're going we're going to starve to death i'm going to make this a little bit no no listen i want you to listen make me a little cake first and if you follow what i if you believe what i have to say to you says you'll never want glory right the the meal will never run out the crew will never go dry amen and you know she went out there and she made that little bit for him and you know what she was able to sustain them in that time just by following the simple instructions that that elijah had that god had already provided and brothers and sister god has already provided for you and me he's already provided everything that you have need of in this earthly journey but the problem is we don't want to let go we want to try to figure out things on our own or we want to have some kind of control on our own and not realizing that you know what none of it belongs to us you know i i think i think of the the the prodigal son you know the prodigal son when he went out there and you know and and he had he must had a pretty good living you know with everything that he had and you know and he decided hey you know what i'm grown i got the answers i'm gonna do my own thing and he's like then he told his dad he said give me my portion i want mine give me mine i got this i'm ready to go make my own living ready to go do my own thing you know and you know no no doubt it broke the father's heart to do that but that's what he wanted you know the father knowing what was going to take place because if you if you're not if you're not equipped to to handle the situation you're going to miserably fail and so you know he took on he took on his living and then he went out and he said you know he he lived you know riotous living he spent all that he had why because he had no plan he hadn't had no had no uh foundation he had not had no purpose in what he was trying to do he just he's just like today in the in the world that we live in in this generation it's just hey we're gonna do whatever feels good we're just gonna we're just gonna we're just gonna meet our our needs whatever whatever satisfies whatever tickles my funny bone or whatever you know that's all we're gonna do oh yeah and i have no and i have no plan but the next thing you know it sees the worst place that a jewish boy could be is down by a pig pen right down there with a bunch of hogs and trying to feed them and said that he would find they eat from the husk that would that the uh pigs were given he said but no man would give to him here he was you know come from all this had a great father had a great background you know had a good home and everything no no i got to do my own thing and then he ends up in a mess and then he's down there starving and trying to figure out how the world he's going to do and he said you know i got to go back home i got to go back to my you know he said my father's servants are at home and they got bread and and some despair and he said you know they're not going hungry but i'm down here dying i'm the son of this man and here i am dying right and his servants are better off than i am and he said you know he came to himself and realized the condition that he was in and he's like well i'm gonna go back to my father and brothers and sisters we look at the day that we live in and people wonder why things are the condition that people are in and you know i'm on metal a little bit if y'all don't mind and i thank you very much but uh you know we live we live in the condition and people wonder why that they live in that they're in the condition that they're in and you know you know i just want to meddle for a little bit but you know people wonder why they they can't get ahead people people work and you know and you know as wade was talking about the other day being being the boss and you know trying to have employees and take care of things well you know what if you gotta if you've got an employee that don't do what they're supposed to do you know what they soon find themselves on the street you're not going to have them around because you don't need them and you know what brothers and sisters the bible tells us that we are stewards what is a steward a steward is somebody that has something that takes care of something they don't own it they take care of it they manage it the bible tells us the blessing of the lord it maketh rich it has it has no adds no sorrow to it but you know we got people out there that that you know they wonder why they can't get ahead in life why because they don't follow god's plan when you know when when god has blessed us and you know i was listening to somebody the other day and they were talking about you know people's like man i wish i had a million dollars you know what brother wayne i wish i had a million dollars i wish i had a million dollars man what i could do if i had a million dollars and you know what people don't realize they've already had a million dollars if you sit down and take with the money that you've made over the last 20 years you've already had a million dollars some people have actually had more than a million dollars over the last 20 years and they ain't got two nickels to run together right and they wonder why they ain't got anything well you know but one of the problems that people have is they rob god you know what you don't pay tithes then guess what you know you can't have any blessings he said prove me and see he said oh and i'll tell you something else i got i got that and this is what the bible says so you have to you have to deal with that the bible says to bring your ties into the storehouse it never says send them it says to bring your tithes into the storehouse not send them that's what the bible says the bible says to bring your tithes into the storehouse brain not sinned but you know there's a lot of churches you know they like to have their website and everybody just you just swipe your debit card online you can send it i might step on some toes i might get hurt after that but it's still the truth i said what the bible says i don't know y'all handle that however you want to but people don't pay their tithes people don't people don't believe in giving to god and the problem is is they get their eyes on man well i'm not i'm not going to give money to him you know what you know if you're giving money to if you if you've got your mind on the man it's like well i'm not going to give my money to brother dale then you know what you're not getting the blessings of god because you're not applying the word right because it's giving to god not to a man if you think well i'm going to give it to brother so-and-so or so brother so-and-so or whoever you give it to if you want to send it to jeffersonville or whoever they plan on sending their money to the problem is if you're not giving it to god it's wrong so we got to we've got to have our mind because you know the problem is is people are so bound by things that that are in their mind and not realizing that you know god is in control of all of it it's god's not yours people want to love some of money and not realize that you know you know how you know talk about brother wade here you know having a business well if wade had a business and you know you had and you know you had somebody that was working for you and they were managing three people and they couldn't manage three people and they couldn't figure out how to get everything done you wouldn't give them 12 people to manage would you no no yeah they'd be gone well some people you know lord give me a million dollars and i'll show you that it won't ruin me the god's gave you a half a million dollars over the last 15 years and it's ruined you right now and people and people wonder why and yeah you know and it's the same way in the gospel now you know you look at you look at the the scripture when it when it comes to money well you know what we're just going we're just going to live high and mighty and you know what and the problem is is it leads to a destruction but it's the same way with the gospel the problem is is people want to you know hey i just i just want to come and hear the pastor i'm just going to hear come you know what i'm not going to pray and i'm not going to read and i'm not going to do anything on my own i just want you to give it to me brother dale and brother wade brother bob brother elise i'm just going to come and i'm going to let y'all give it to me and i don't have to do any study i don't have to read i don't do anything i'm just going to come and i'm going to soak it up right yep come on well let me tell you brothers and sisters you know what if it would be so simple if we could just learn by osmosis we could just we just you know i would just make a bed of the message books i just make a pill all the message books and i could just sleep i just wrap myself in the message yeah yeah put a message back on each ear and just but i mean that's what you know it's just so simple because i would just have to lay down this one yeah but you know it's a battle it's a struggle you know you know if it was just so easy well you know what if it was just so easy you know brother wade we could just take the bible we just tear pages out of it and just say we're going to eat the book if it was that simple but it's not but god gave us away how do you how do you get closer to god he said to pray and read your bible we need to be listening to the word if we get into the word then you know what the word gets into us god can have communication with us but the problem is is if we don't ever do that how do we expect to grow how do we ever expect to get anywhere with god [Applause] god god has blessed us but sometimes we don't we we get our soul mind so wrapped up and we don't even realize what god's blessed us with you know you know you you listen to people come on we listen to people like dave ramsey and you know and you know i don't i you know i i listen to people you know i think i got it bad sometimes you realize you know what i ain't got nothing no it's it's like man the conditions people are in amen but you know god has given us away and it's and it's so simple and it's it and it's so simple and you know what people struggle with it and and it's so simple because you know what brother like if somebody was dying if you had somebody that was dying and you told them say listen you're not gonna make it and this is what you're gonna have to do you're gonna die and if you plan on living beyond this point this is what you're going to have to do and this is your plan and we'll give you the prescription and here's here's the things you got to do well you know what if you if you were concerned about your health if you're concerned about living then you know what it would it wouldn't matter you know what i i i got money i was like oh well the doctor wants me to juice well you know what by george i'm learning how to juice and if the lord wants me to or the doctor wants me to take this stuff over here that that's you know cost a thousand dollars an ounce or whatever then you know what i'm i'm getting it even if the insurance don't pay if it's gonna get me well i'm going to take it and there's people that sell their houses and their cars and everything else to get what they need to make it why because life is precious to them and you know what there's nothing going to stop them from taking what god you know what the doctor tells them but you know the problem is is when when god gives you a prescription let me tell you this world is not going to last we're you know we're we don't know how much longer we have but you know like brother brown i'm talking about uh california he's like all that lays under here is a honeycomb and he said he said the judgment of god is resting out there and he didn't know how much longer it would be he said it's like that scientist said he said it's not if it's going to happen he said it when it's going to happen and let me tell you some brother sisters there's a rapture coming one day and it's a true thing it's going to happen and you know what none of us are promised tomorrow young people you're not promised tonight you don't know when you're going to be and you think you can ride on mama and daddy's coattail or somebody else's cocktail listen you get to a certain age you're going to come to the age of accountability god's going to speak to your heart and you're going to have to give an answer to god i can't answer for you brother dale can't answer for your mom and daddy can't answer for you you'll have to give an answer for yourself and let me tell you something brother scissors to to be lacks in the hour that we live in and and you know because you know we can get wrapped up in so many things but you know we've got to be to the place where we stand up and we we get desperate on what's going on and how we're how we're conducting ourselves to be ready in this hour god has blessed us but god has called us to a holy calling god has called us to a place that we we fulfill the word of god that god has called us to but the thing i want to tell you some of the brothers and sisters tonight god has said he he said he said taste and see that the lord is good he wants you to try him he wants you to prove him why because he's there and he wants to pray he wants to show you what he's got but the thing is is are you going to go in there and accept it you're going to take him at his word are you going to do what god wants you to do and and fight the battle and whatever it takes you do what god wants you to do and you me because god will give you exactly what you have need of he makes the condition as brother luis was preaching some time back you know when peter was there he said lord if that's you he said then bid me to come well you know what he he you know he didn't he didn't say well listen peter i want you to do this you may you may you may have prom though no he didn't he didn't give him nothing else but he told him to come that's all he told him he said lord in fact you bid me to come well he didn't give him no condition he said come and you know it's so simple it's the same way god does he tell you if you're going to take the lord i need healing in my body and you know i'm so tired of being sick and tired and whatever i whatever i'm i'm facing and you know i've got these aches and these pains and all these other things well you know what god is still the healer and the thing is that you've got to you've got to drive your stake down and make your claim and make your testimony sure and and so you know whatever god has done that but you know what you've got to take him at his word then you stand up and you confess what god said and you know every time the devil comes at you i ain't got time to listen to that get behind me saying i got time listen to that amen i'm i'm healed that's the reason i like singing that song i am healed i am whole from the top of my head to the souls to the tip of my toes he said isaiah 53 5 says we are and if we are then i am why because he said it first peter 2 24 says we were and if we were then i am why because he said it then all i got to do is believe that you know that whatever i have need of then god will meet my needs but you know the thing is is i've got to claim what god has done and say lord what do i need to do because god will lead you along the way and you know so many times people get to a certain place and they don't know where else to go yeah it's like it's like they're between a rock and a hard place well the good thing is is god's error in the rock and the hard place because that's where god wants you to be because many times god can get your attention now you you get to the place that god wants you to be it's like we make it well lord i made a mistake lord i made a mess of this thing well you know what that ain't the time to give up you know now's the time just like just like the prodigal son when you're sitting down there and and down there with the pig pen guess what the lord's speaking to you now it's time to wake up come to yourselves you go turn around you're just like well you know everything's a mess i don't know what to go well you know what it takes a journey of one step when we come to the place that we realize then we go from there we don't spend all our time worried about what took place in the past or trying to figure these things out we need to move forward with god god's calling us to a place we need to move on with god amen the scripture tells us i love that scripture said this man this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him from all of his troubles i mean you know when you cry out to god when you have a need and you need something then you know where to go to to get your answer god can give you the answer exactly what you have need of god is here to meet your need but do you are you actually going for it because the manna is here god the manna has fallen god has given everything that you have need of is here in the word but the thing is is do you take the prescription have you raised up and accepted what god has given you right amen let's let's stand because you know it's so amazing you know because you know if if i had if i had a million dollars if somebody gave me a million dollars you know what i you know i got a million dollars you know some people get excited about that you know hey i got you know look what i got look what the lord blessed me i got a million dollars you know i got a million dollars i'd have i'd have you know generous i believe it's like the joy of the lord is my strength the joy of the lord is my strength yeah well let me tell you what they don't sound like too much like joy but but you know it's just like i was talking about one time you know you you drive up to up south carolina you go down to athens you got people going down you go down to clemson boy got

there but let me tell you something people come to church and not realize the the god of all heaven the god of all creation that fills all time space and eternity comes to me that's on on sundays and on wednesdays and and speak through our brothers and you know these and speak to the the message that god has sent and you know what people have so they don't even realize what god has done and he's like well you know it's just wade that's just bro louise and and you know not realizing god has come to meet you you know no wonder when you know when we sing the song we are standing on holy ground do we actually believe that or is that just words you know we are standing in his presence if you believe that he's here tonight then you're in his presence and he is here to meet your need he come to meet you because he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name i'm there in the midst so if you've got a need if you've got a question if you've got a concern whatever it is he's here but you know what the thing is it breaks the father's heart when you leave out that door and you don't get your need met but you know what god is here to meet your need but the problem is have you come to receive from him you know when the when the woman with the issue of blood was she came she you know she didn't even have a word to stand on there's no place in the scripture says if you touch the savior's garment you get healed but you know what she believed inside of herself that you know what she no now she had heard and seen the things that jesus had done she didn't even have to have him touch her she didn't even have to touch him all she had to do was touch the hem of his garment when she got to the place that she was so desperate when she desired so much that everything else was gone and the only thing that she had between life and death was him she got to the place she said if i can but touch the hem of his garments brothers and sisters a child of god doesn't have to go that far his desire is for you and for you to have all things it's his pleasure to give you the kingdom brothers and sisters let's be faithful in what god has called us to let's be faithful in what god has called us to that's the reason i'm i love i love that quote it's one it's probably one of my favorite quotes in the whole whole message i i love it and it's that lady that had the bible and her son you know was sending those mess those little postcards and she just thought they were pretty pictures and she just stacked them in her bible starving to death had needs charity was trying to take care of her trying to figure out everything but it took somebody to come and show her what laid in the bible and when they began to show her all that she had need of laid right there in the scripture but she didn't see it you know what god has come in our day to show us what we have need of ladies right here in the scripture whatever you have need of like lord i want to be closer to you lord you know because the word for a body change lays in the word it's right here god called called a group of people that would come and not taste death paul said those that we that are alive and remain behold i show you a mission we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed then you know brother brown said you know it's been spoken the word the word the rapture came and he began to speak then told the scripture now let it be fulfilled right he preached the rapture to show us that the rapture was here it's not you know everybody had it all confused and everything but you know he began to show god has descended right amen the show god is here and not real you know because the word has come and now we've received the word that we can go into into a rapture the word has come for a body change but brothers and sisters that we have to receive that and believe that so god bless you tonight let's all stand we can receive the word that we have need of i'm ready to get out of here thank you lord all

you to the exact place you know when the lord resp spoke to me years ago on genesis 12 talking about abraham and and leaving it leaving your father's house and going out and he said he said i'm going to take you to a place and he said those that bless you will be blessed and those that curse you will be cursed and you know i didn't fully understand what god was trying to tell me at that time but

take you the right the exact spot where i was sitting in my truck when the lord spoke to me about that i can take i can take you to the exact place when i was praying for brother dick that time and i can take you the exact spot where i was at when i was in the truck and god told me brother dick he said lazarus was dead four days and brother dick hadn't made it that far when brother dick was fighting cancer you know i was so burdened by that and you know it was like you know what that's right i don't have to i'm not i don't have to worry i don't have to fear about it why because then god had in control you know because i think that's all god wanted me to do you know god gave that burden to me but you know what i gave it back you know because i thank the lord brother dick's gonna be fine but you know i can take you to that exact spot where god spoke to me where god has spoke to me at different times in my life and gave me answers to things and showed me things that were in the word and all of a sudden i could take you those exact i know exactly where i was at and you know what and god wants you to have that same spot you know because you can go right back to the god give
