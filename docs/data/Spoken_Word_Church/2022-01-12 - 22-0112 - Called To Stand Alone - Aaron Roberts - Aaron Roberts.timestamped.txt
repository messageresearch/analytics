[19:06] to begin at first
[19:08] 26 and uh just titled this called to
[19:12] stand alone
[19:14] and uh i was
[19:17] i was talking to the
[19:20] i got to speak brother boyd's sunday
[19:21] school class sunday and kind of
[19:24] come some things come to me and
[19:27] just won't speak on that uh verse 26
[19:30] says and david spake to the men
[19:32] that stood by him saying what shall be
[19:34] done to the man that killeth this
[19:36] philistine and taketh away the reproach
[19:38] from israel for who is this
[19:40] uncircumcised philistine that he should
[19:42] divide defy the armies of the living god
[19:46] and the people answered him after this
[19:48] men are saying so shall it be done to
[19:50] the man that killeth him
[19:53] and elia his eldest brother heard when
[19:56] he spake unto the men and elijah's
[19:59] anger was kindled against david and he
[20:01] said why camest thou down hither
[20:04] and with whom hast thou left those few
[20:06] sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride
[20:09] and the naughtiness of thine heart for
[20:11] thou art come down that thou mighty see
[20:14] the battle
[20:15] and david said what have i done now now
[20:18] done
[20:19] is there not a cause
[20:22] and he turned from him toward another
[20:24] and spake after the same manner and the
[20:26] people answered him again after the
[20:28] former manner
[20:30] and when when the words were heard which
[20:33] david spake they rehearsed them before
[20:36] saul and he sent for him and david said
[20:38] to saul let no man's heart fail because
[20:40] of him thy servant will go and fight
[20:44] with this philistine
[20:46] and saul said to david
[20:48] thou art not able to go against this
[20:50] philistine to fight with him
[20:53] for thou art but a youth and he a man of
[20:56] war from his youth
[20:59] amen so god bless you not you may be
[21:00] seated
[21:04] and
[21:05] i was speaking
[21:09] i was speaking to the young people
[21:12] in the sunday school class and
[21:14] i was i was talking about where
[21:18] you know paul was writing to timothy
[21:21] and he said let no man despise thy youth
[21:23] but be thou an example of the believer
[21:25] and you know i was talking about david
[21:28] david david had a real encouraging
[21:30] report
[21:32] but you know david had had an experience
[21:36] david had david had a
[21:39] a relationship david had
[21:42] um
[21:44] he had a walk with god he knew who he
[21:46] was
[21:47] and so when he went out there
[21:49] david had a testimony
[21:52] and you know and and we we go back into
[21:55] into the scripture here and and you you
[21:58] i you know
[21:59] many people have read this scripture and
[22:01] many people have preached on it but i i
[22:02] just love i just love the the types and
[22:05] and all the things that are in this
[22:06] whole chapter and
[22:08] you know i was i was talking
[22:11] uh sunday the sunday school class you
[22:13] know you see how
[22:14] you know the the the philistines had
[22:18] gathered on one side of this uh valley
[22:20] on the mountain and and israel had come
[22:22] out and they had set everything in a ray
[22:24] and you know you they look like they
[22:27] were ready to fight
[22:30] because they had everything i mean they
[22:31] played the part i mean they've done the
[22:32] part because they come out and brought
[22:34] everything and set it everything in
[22:35] order
[22:36] just like they were going to battle
[22:38] but as soon as goliath come out there
[22:40] nobody wanted to fight him
[22:43] but he you know he had he had come and
[22:45] and made his boats before him
[22:48] and you know here they they come down
[22:50] into this valley and set everything up
[22:52] and everybody was so afraid of what they
[22:54] had seen in front of it
[22:57] and you know
[22:58] and how all this great massive army had
[23:00] come but they had just had one person
[23:03] and that and goliath was the only one
[23:04] that come and boasted
[23:07] and challenged them
[23:09] and so you know and and you and you
[23:12] start to see how how this all plays out
[23:14] and
[23:15] um
[23:15] i was reading on this and what was so
[23:18] interesting was i was i was reading on
[23:19] this and the next thing you know i was
[23:21] listening to brother branham and he
[23:22] started talking about the same thing and
[23:24] i was i was listening to a part of a
[23:26] sermon from another brother and he was
[23:28] preaching on the same thing it was like
[23:29] well i think i think that maybe what the
[23:31] lord wants me to talk about tonight
[23:32] because it just seemed like everywhere i
[23:34] turned it was it was covering the same
[23:36] thing and
[23:37] and uh this is from this is from the the
[23:39] message jehovah jireh 1964
[23:43] and brother branham says now just take a
[23:46] look at yourself in god's mirror
[23:49] and just see if you can identify
[23:50] yourself tonight
[23:52] if you had been living in the days of
[23:54] noah in the time of the flood what side
[23:56] would you be identified with
[23:58] if you was living in the days of moses
[24:01] what side would you have been on if you
[24:04] had lived in the days of christ when all
[24:06] the churches was against him he had to
[24:08] stand alone out there and the things he
[24:11] did
[24:12] only thing was god was with him that's
[24:14] the only thing
[24:16] even all of his disciples nearly walked
[24:18] away from him
[24:19] but what side just your presence state
[24:22] now
[24:23] where would you
[24:25] what side would you be on
[24:27] what side would you be on right now when
[24:30] you see him again right amongst us
[24:35] and i tell you
[24:37] that done something for me
[24:40] because you know sometimes we fail to
[24:41] realize that god is amongst us god is
[24:44] with us god is in us but he said what
[24:46] side would you be on
[24:48] but you know you know because god has
[24:51] called us to stand for the word
[24:54] and you have to stand and you sometimes
[24:55] you have to stand by yourself
[24:58] and he said now he is here and he can
[25:00] turn on the light in your heart just
[25:02] fill your life with the holy spirit and
[25:05] then he says how many of here with heads
[25:06] bowed hearts you pray for me
[25:10] so how many and because if you don't
[25:13] have that peace if you don't have that
[25:14] deep settled peace if you're not in that
[25:16] place then you know what it's time to
[25:18] today is the day of salvation today is
[25:20] get to that place
[25:22] but let me tell you if you if you have a
[25:24] question in your heart if you've got a
[25:26] challenge if you're facing something
[25:27] tonight
[25:29] greater is he that's in us than he
[25:30] that's in the world
[25:34] and you know it just it just struck me
[25:36] because when you begin to see this this
[25:38] man in this situation
[25:41] and the part of this story you know
[25:43] because we know all the things that had
[25:45] went through and and we know that the
[25:47] the greatest man that israel had at the
[25:50] time was saul and and saul was a head
[25:52] and shoulders above everybody else and
[25:54] he should have been in in a great
[25:55] position to fight this man and and
[25:58] everything but you know he didn't he was
[26:00] brother ma'am said he was a coward
[26:04] but what struck me was you know here's
[26:06] here's this man
[26:08] this little boy
[26:11] that had a testimony
[26:13] that had known and you know what it was
[26:15] it wasn't what nobody else nobody else
[26:17] knew what david had been through
[26:20] nobody else had known what kind of
[26:22] experience he had but you know what
[26:23] david knew where he was standing
[26:26] david knew what his experience was
[26:29] i know where i'm standing
[26:32] because when they went out there and
[26:34] when he heard
[26:36] brother madam said the worst mistake
[26:37] goliath ever done was say that in front
[26:39] of david
[26:42] why because david david knew who he was
[26:44] and david knew because god had done
[26:46] something for david
[26:49] and we know that we know that david had
[26:51] been called
[26:52] and had been anointed king
[26:56] when everybody else had overlooked him
[26:59] when he come to the place when he come
[27:01] when
[27:02] samuel had come to jesse's house to
[27:04] anoint a king the last one had almost
[27:07] forgotten about
[27:09] was the man after god's own heart
[27:13] the the least at least in the whole
[27:15] family
[27:16] the least in the whole king in the whole
[27:18] and his whole father's house
[27:21] but he was the one that god called why
[27:22] because god knew what kind of man david
[27:25] was
[27:27] and he began to you know and then he
[27:29] began to go and he began to no no doubt
[27:32] david had had known the word and he had
[27:34] and he had a relationship with god
[27:36] because he he saw god
[27:40] and god's soul what kind of man he was
[27:42] and what kind of man he would be
[27:43] and then when when he began to walk in
[27:46] in these things and you know standing on
[27:48] the backside of the desert doing other
[27:49] jobs that probably nobody else wanted to
[27:51] do because he was the youngest
[27:54] but you know what he he had time to
[27:56] fellowship with god
[27:58] he had he had time to look at nature and
[28:01] see all these things and and have a
[28:03] relationship with god and and for god to
[28:06] speak to him
[28:07] and you know you know so so if he just
[28:10] had a little bit of just these few sheep
[28:12] to take care of in the backside of the
[28:13] wilderness you know what god was able to
[28:15] use that to mold his character to mold
[28:18] him through experience into the place
[28:20] that he ought to be
[28:22] and so many times we look at we look at
[28:24] situations in our lives and we wonder
[28:26] why things happen the way they do well
[28:29] lots of times we don't we don't
[28:30] appreciate the things that take place
[28:33] the way things happen in our lives
[28:40] you know i always like this
[28:43] when you when you think about the the
[28:44] children of israel when they went out to
[28:46] battle and here they are standing on on
[28:48] the mountaintops but you know brother
[28:50] brother brandon said you know everybody
[28:52] loves to have a mountaintop experience
[28:54] but he said real growth takes place in
[28:56] the valley and he said you know that's
[28:58] where david ended up david had to go
[29:00] through the valley
[29:01] he had to be in the valley because
[29:03] that's where the battle took place you
[29:05] can you can have you can have your
[29:06] mountaintops and stand up there and
[29:08] everything looked great
[29:10] but you know what nobody nobody got
[29:11] anything done up there
[29:14] but you know he was he was out there in
[29:16] the back side of the desert
[29:18] probably nobody knew where he was at or
[29:20] really cared
[29:22] but you know what he was he was having
[29:24] fellowship with god
[29:27] when when a lion came and and the bear
[29:30] came well you know what he didn't he
[29:32] knew how to fight
[29:34] why because he when he because his
[29:37] testimony was it wasn't in his ability
[29:39] to do that
[29:42] let me tell you what i mean when you
[29:44] when you look at those things because i
[29:45] tell you what as big as i am you know
[29:47] what i wouldn't want to be in his shoes
[29:52] i tell you what there's a lot there's a
[29:54] lot of guns that i own that i wouldn't
[29:56] want to be holding and trying to shoot
[29:58] one of them
[30:01] because you know when he said he had a
[30:03] hold of that line he said i had him by
[30:05] by the head
[30:07] he had him by the mane
[30:08] when he slew him
[30:11] that's a little bit too close for
[30:13] comfort for me
[30:16] but you know he said but he said god
[30:19] laid them in his hand
[30:22] so when he came forth he said he said
[30:25] god put that bear in my hands
[30:29] now you know everybody talks about the
[30:31] wonderful davie crockett
[30:33] and everybody talking about david
[30:34] crockett killing a bear when he was only
[30:36] three well you know what that's folklore
[30:38] and here's saying fantasy
[30:41] but you know what let me tell you i can
[30:42] take you to the scripture where a young
[30:44] boy had a bear put in his hands and he
[30:47] got slow but you know everybody can sing
[30:49] about everything else about everything
[30:50] but they won't they don't know anything
[30:52] about david
[30:54] brother brown said you know everybody
[30:56] knows about matt dillon and and davey
[30:58] crockett and all the rest of them but
[31:00] they don't know who is in the scripture
[31:04] you know we could see somebody that god
[31:05] took a young boy
[31:07] that was that was ready looking and he
[31:09] wasn't wasn't the the maybe not the most
[31:12] educated wasn't the best looking wasn't
[31:14] the tallest
[31:15] but you know he didn't have a whole lot
[31:17] going for him but he had one thing he
[31:18] knew who god was and god knew who he was
[31:21] he had a relationship with god
[31:24] and then all of a sudden when it came
[31:25] time that he was watching over those few
[31:27] sheep yet he had an experience with god
[31:30] that he knew that when those animals
[31:32] came in and they were only doing what
[31:34] they were called to do
[31:38] a bear is only going to kill lambs and
[31:40] they're going to cure sheep one because
[31:42] that's their nature
[31:44] and the bears the same way they come in
[31:46] they're going to do the same thing
[31:49] but you know what they were put in in
[31:51] david's hands and david slew both of
[31:53] them
[31:55] and then you know then when he began to
[31:57] speak to these people when he began to
[31:59] speak to the children of israel
[32:01] when goliath came in the camp
[32:03] and he began to speak to him and
[32:05] challenge them
[32:08] then listen
[32:09] i need somebody to come and fight me we
[32:11] don't all have to fight
[32:14] and he said he said that's the way that
[32:16] that's the way david that's the way the
[32:18] devil is
[32:20] when he thinks you've got what he thinks
[32:22] he likes it when he thinks he's got the
[32:24] situation the way he wants it
[32:27] he's going to come out and he's going to
[32:29] boast and he's going to brag and he's
[32:30] going to lay this challenge out there
[32:39] but see that's the way brother said
[32:40] that's the way satan is he like he likes
[32:42] to lay that challenge out there and
[32:43] everything everything looks the same
[32:45] everything looks that so well for him
[32:48] and yeah and it it done exactly what he
[32:50] wanted it to do he wanted them to be
[32:52] afraid
[32:53] he wanted them to be to fear what was
[32:56] going to take place
[32:58] and it starts at and it starts at the
[33:00] very top
[33:02] at the very top of this whole situation
[33:04] was saul and saul was a coward
[33:06] well you know what when he was a coward
[33:08] then you know what it just creates
[33:09] cowards
[33:12] when you when you when you have
[33:13] leadership that doesn't have a backbone
[33:15] then you know what then the church
[33:17] doesn't have a backbone either well you
[33:19] know because you you see when you have
[33:21] when you have a preacher that will
[33:22] compromise when you have when you have a
[33:25] leader that will compromise then you
[33:26] know what then everything else falls
[33:28] apart
[33:29] why because that's the reason why it's
[33:31] so important for us as as laity that
[33:35] it's us is our job to support the
[33:37] five-fold ministry this is our it's our
[33:41] job to uphold the pastor
[33:43] why because it's his job to shepherd but
[33:46] he's got to lead but you know what we've
[33:48] got to get behind him we've got to be
[33:49] able to support him and lift him up why
[33:52] because he's got a job to do
[33:55] [Applause]
[33:58] well because you've got to get behind
[33:59] him but you've got to you've got to find
[34:01] a pastor that's god called and has a has
[34:04] a vision of what's supposed to take
[34:05] place and has a has a way to go and
[34:08] knows what's going to take place
[34:10] and when you have that then but see saul
[34:12] didn't have that
[34:15] brother branham said saul had a lot of
[34:16] theology on how to fight but he never
[34:18] had an experience
[34:21] so he he had a lot of ideas had a lot of
[34:24] thoughts but when it came to put it in
[34:25] practice he never done any of it
[34:28] so he had to go find one little boy that
[34:31] that had that you know was still wet
[34:33] behind the ears so to speak but he had
[34:35] an experience and he had something that
[34:37] he could draw on and tell those people
[34:39] about that's right
[34:42] but he went out there and you know and
[34:43] when he heard goliath speak
[34:46] when he heard goliath calling out and
[34:48] challenging them
[34:50] well you know what that was just more
[34:52] than david could handle
[34:55] david they was like oh no he said oh he
[34:57] said is there not a cause
[35:01] and it's like why is it that every every
[35:04] god called
[35:06] soldier in this army is just standing
[35:08] here looking at this guy
[35:11] what is it because every one of you have
[35:14] been called into this army you have been
[35:16] equipped
[35:18] to be and that's the reason he said why
[35:20] is he that he has defied the armies of
[35:22] the living god
[35:24] why because he knew what i mean
[35:27] this is the battle this it never was
[35:30] israel's battle
[35:32] it never was israel's battle god never
[35:34] called them he said it's always when
[35:36] they followed his plan it was always the
[35:39] lord's the battle is the lord's
[35:42] and so when he called him into this
[35:44] battle he's like why is it that y'all
[35:45] cannot raise up and fight this man
[35:50] why because when it just just fear
[35:52] breeds fear absolutely amen
[35:55] and uncertainty and doubt breeds
[35:57] uncertainty and doubt
[36:00] but you know what he wasn't in that camp
[36:03] he was not under that that headship
[36:06] so to speak why because he had his own
[36:08] experience
[36:12] and so when he went down there to see
[36:14] that
[36:18] he was so fired up
[36:20] so to speak you know because i mean
[36:22] something kindled inside of david when
[36:24] he heard those challenges
[36:27] and then he began to speak and he's like
[36:30] is there not a cause he said you know he
[36:32] want to know more about it you know
[36:34] what's going to take place if somebody
[36:35] can defeat this man
[36:39] so what so what it what is what is the
[36:43] you know no doubt there had to be some
[36:44] sort of after this challenge was made no
[36:46] doubt somebody had to offer you know
[36:48] saul had to offer him something
[36:52] you know i mean you know so what i mean
[36:53] you know if you don't if you're not
[36:55] motivated by the word if you're not made
[36:57] if you're not motivated something's
[36:58] going to motivate you
[37:01] but you know none of that
[37:02] hey
[37:03] there wasn't enough money in the kingdom
[37:04] going going to get some of them to go
[37:06] out there and fight goliath
[37:09] but it did that didn't matter to david
[37:10] david knew who was on his side
[37:13] it wasn't it wasn't because when david
[37:15] realized that he had made those
[37:17] challenges to to the living god he made
[37:19] him to he it wasn't just the army it was
[37:21] to the living god
[37:23] he had defied god he had challenged god
[37:27] and so when they when they came forth
[37:29] you know he's like nobody's going to
[37:31] raise up
[37:33] but you know his brother comes out there
[37:35] and tells him a liability comes out and
[37:37] you know it's like well you're only here
[37:39] because you know
[37:40] you're just you're just naughty
[37:43] you know you're you're jo you're just
[37:44] playing hooky and you're just
[37:46] mischievous and you know you're not
[37:48] doing what you ought to be because you
[37:49] ought to be down there taking care of
[37:50] them sheep that dad told you to take
[37:52] care of and you don't need to be down
[37:54] here
[37:55] and he's like well you know my dad sent
[37:57] me down here with gifts and to check on
[37:58] y'all
[38:00] but you know he didn't say that no no no
[38:03] you're just down here because it's all
[38:05] your pride
[38:07] it's all about you
[38:10] no it wasn't about david
[38:13] david realized it was all about god
[38:16] it's all about serving god
[38:19] it's all about standing for the word
[38:22] that's what it was all about but nobody
[38:25] saw that but then here comes david
[38:26] trying to talk to him
[38:28] is there not a cause is there no any
[38:30] reason why to rise up and fight
[38:33] is there nothing inside of you that's
[38:35] kindled by what this man says
[38:38] amen
[38:39] no
[38:41] no we're we're we're staying over here
[38:43] we're waiting we're waiting don't kings
[38:45] all
[38:47] we're waiting on and see what this other
[38:48] one does or this one does
[38:50] well you know what you don't have to
[38:51] wait and see what everybody else does
[38:55] you know people come to church and they
[38:56] won't clap their hands but they're going
[38:58] to wait to see if somebody else claps
[38:59] their hands
[39:01] wait wait if somebody else stands up
[39:05] you know if so if somebody else does you
[39:07] know it's like you know you have
[39:09] you know blessed the heart sometimes
[39:11] wait and and
[39:13] guilty too
[39:16] but you know sometimes sometimes
[39:17] sometimes well
[39:19] lots of times uh if if i'm i'm trying to
[39:22] think and i'm writing stuff down
[39:23] sometimes i don't say amen but i try
[39:25] to say amen but you know there's a lot
[39:27] of times people don't people don't say
[39:28] amen it's like you know it's like
[39:30] but i mean you know
[39:31] the other the other night
[39:33] the other night when that when the ball
[39:36] game was going on
[39:38] you know let me tell you when people
[39:39] when the ball game was going on there's
[39:41] a lot of folks that got excited
[39:45] and there's a lot of people that got
[39:46] upset
[39:48] but you know what people wasn't just
[39:50] sitting there
[39:51] looking at the screen
[39:55] there's a lot of people sit on the edge
[39:56] of their seat
[39:59] one because it was something excited and
[40:00] one because it was something that
[40:02] stirred something up inside of them
[40:06] but when but when the devil comes
[40:07] against your family
[40:10] when the devil comes against your house
[40:11] when the devil comes against your health
[40:14] when it goes when the devil comes in and
[40:16] then you're just going to well i'm just
[40:17] going to take a seat back
[40:19] no
[40:22] no david was like no no no no no no no
[40:25] let me tell you something
[40:28] because david realized you know what i'm
[40:30] i'm i'm the hands that that god has
[40:32] these are god's hands
[40:34] and these are god's
[40:36] feet why because i've been anointed for
[40:39] something
[40:41] that's right
[40:42] and you know so if i've been anointed
[40:44] god's called me to this then you know
[40:46] what i can i'm gonna take up for god
[40:49] why because god has done something for
[40:50] me
[40:53] and so when he come out there and he
[40:54] began to speak to all of them and nobody
[40:56] would agree with him
[40:59] and a whole and a whole crowd a whole
[41:01] army all these people are all standing
[41:03] around
[41:05] and not just soldiers but but all the
[41:07] support people that were with him with
[41:09] the army all of those people that were
[41:11] there and he couldn't find a single
[41:12] person that would agree with him
[41:16] oh no no no no no
[41:18] not us
[41:20] no
[41:22] why everybody had to get out there and
[41:24] they were all showing that they had a
[41:25] yellow streak a half a mile long
[41:27] oh no no no no
[41:29] we're not getting involved in this
[41:32] but you know what he was so adamant at
[41:34] what he believed and what god has showed
[41:37] him and it experienced that he had been
[41:39] through he was so adamant about it that
[41:41] you know what everybody was started
[41:43] listening to david and they finally went
[41:45] and told saul we got this crazy kid in
[41:47] the camp
[41:50] and he's down here thinking he's gonna
[41:52] whip this fella yeah right
[41:55] and then you know then all of a sudden
[41:56] they said well bring it so i want to
[41:57] meet this guy
[42:00] and he's like well don't let everybody
[42:02] you know get all upset and their hearts
[42:04] fail don't worry about everybody fearing
[42:06] and and everything don't worry about it
[42:08] because you know what i'll take care of
[42:10] it
[42:12] you know no no listen listen you can't
[42:14] do this david
[42:17] now that that has to be that has to be a
[42:19] very a hard position to be in
[42:23] when no i mean when you're standing and
[42:25] you know because god has called us and
[42:27] god calls us and what puts us in hard
[42:29] positions and hard times to see how
[42:31] you're going to stand how you're going
[42:32] to react
[42:34] would you stand there like david david's
[42:35] standing there and he was he was the
[42:37] only one that's going to stand up for
[42:39] what the word said
[42:42] oh no no david listen listen you're just
[42:44] a little boy
[42:48] you got a lot of growing up to do
[42:51] but just fell out here
[42:54] he's just massive
[42:56] just huge
[42:58] i mean look how big he is
[43:02] and like you got no you got no chance
[43:04] against this guy
[43:08] i mean he's he's just so look david how
[43:10] big this guy is
[43:13] it's like well they don't you know they
[43:14] didn't phase david
[43:17] you know because when when he began to
[43:19] look at these things he was just like
[43:21] when when elisha was standing there on
[43:22] the mountain he was speaking to hazy you
[43:24] know he stood there and said you know
[43:26] i'm not worried about the army that's
[43:27] gathered all around me so why because
[43:29] there's more of it with us than they are
[43:30] with them
[43:34] hey guys stand there going
[43:39] who's he talking to
[43:43] then he said lord open this boy's eyes
[43:46] and then he realized there's a hole
[43:48] there's a whole
[43:49] mountain full
[43:52] the heaven the host the angels everybody
[43:54] the army it was all gathered around them
[43:58] well elisha elisha didn't know i should
[44:01] knew he didn't have to fight this battle
[44:03] it's the battle was the lord's
[44:06] he knew where he was standing
[44:09] so when david walked out there david
[44:11] knew where he was standing david knew
[44:13] what god had called him to do
[44:15] and so when he walked out there and he
[44:17] stood there and he said listen
[44:20] i know you i know you think that that
[44:22] i'm wet behind the ears and i and i
[44:23] can't do anything but let me tell you
[44:25] something
[44:26] i know what i'm where i'm standing
[44:29] i know what i've been through
[44:31] i know what i come from
[44:33] i know what every step of the way
[44:37] let me let me tell you something king
[44:39] saul i was there on the back side of the
[44:41] desert there wasn't nobody else
[44:43] it was me and this sheep
[44:46] but let me tell you something the spirit
[44:48] of the lord came down
[44:50] you know it's just like you know driving
[44:52] riding in a pickup truck and uh and the
[44:54] angel of the lord you know the spirit of
[44:56] the lord comes into the truck with you
[44:58] and then all of a sudden you realize hey
[44:59] you know what i ain't by myself anymore
[45:02] it's just like sitting on a loading dock
[45:04] or laying on a loading dock somewhere
[45:05] and all of a sudden you know what you
[45:07] realize you ain't by yourself anymore
[45:11] wherever wherever you at when you're out
[45:12] in the like brother luis was out there
[45:14] in the water and all of a sudden you
[45:15] know he was getting rolled out there and
[45:16] you know he called out all of a sudden
[45:18] something come up behind him and pushed
[45:20] him back up on the shoulder
[45:22] all of a sudden you realize hey i'm not
[45:23] alone
[45:25] sometimes we fail to realize what's that
[45:27] what's around us what's inside of us
[45:29] he said he said the angels of the lord
[45:31] encountered about those that fear him so
[45:34] he didn't you know david knew who he was
[45:36] and he knew where he was standing and he
[45:38] began to tell saul he said listen king
[45:40] saul he said when i was on the backside
[45:42] of the desert and he said i know this
[45:44] lion came in in the lion no doubt was
[45:47] bigger than he was but you know what he
[45:49] said the lord laid him in my hand and i
[45:51] slew him
[45:52] and he said i was still out there
[45:53] praising the lord and just living on the
[45:56] backside of the desert all by myself and
[45:58] he said and the bear came amen and you
[46:00] know what i didn't worry about the bear
[46:02] why because i knew who i was and i knew
[46:04] who my lord was and he laid him in my
[46:06] hand and i slew him and that was it
[46:09] and he said let me tell you he said the
[46:10] same one that came and met me when i
[46:13] slew the bear and when i slew the lion
[46:15] he said the same one he said because he
[46:17] said those were only following the
[46:19] natural elements of the world and what
[46:22] the what their desire what they were
[46:23] created for
[46:26] but let me tell you something
[46:28] this one he's defied god
[46:33] and now all i got to do is stand
[46:37] i'm going to stand for him
[46:40] and i'm just going to stand in the way
[46:41] and then he's going to come because all
[46:43] i got to do is be willing
[46:47] and he said the same one that slew
[46:48] though that slew the lion and slew the
[46:51] bear he said he's going to slay this un
[46:54] un circumcised philistine
[47:01] but you know in all and all that was
[47:03] said and done and all the things that
[47:04] they came about and all of that you know
[47:06] what saul saw what saul wasn't happy
[47:08] with that
[47:09] so
[47:10] i wasn't uh he couldn't he couldn't go
[47:12] along with that you know they just
[47:14] didn't satisfy him
[47:17] he's like no no no no no listen david

[48:01] thing that set on david

[49:34] stand with the doctor so he can talk and
[49:36] look at you for five minutes talk to you
[49:38] send you a bill and walk back out of the
[49:39] room and haven't done anything for you
[49:43] write you a little piece of paper and
[49:44] hand it to you so here go fill that and
[49:46] take them
[49:48] but it's the same thing no no no no no
[49:50] no god never laid that on us
[49:54] david walked out there and said listen i
[49:55] ain't never proved any of this
[49:58] i never i never fought anything never
[50:01] had to fight a battle where i had to
[50:02] carry your sword and your shield and
[50:05] your helmet i never had to deal with any
[50:07] of that
[50:08] but let me tell you what god has done
[50:10] for me
[50:11] god equipped me with a little slingshot
[50:14] and i have proved this
[50:17] and i know this works
[50:19] and brother branham said this little
[50:21] slingshot is deadly
[50:23] i know what this thing will do so you
[50:26] know what he just shook all that other
[50:27] stuff off and told him said you can keep
[50:28] it because you know what i've seen what
[50:30] it proved what it does what the end
[50:32] result of all of that is and but i tell
[50:35] you what the end result of what i got
[50:38] i know what the end result of this will
[50:39] do why because i'm overcome
[50:42] i've had an experience of an overcoming
[50:44] so that's what i'm going to hold on to
[50:48] i'm not going to hold on to any of your
[50:49] ideas i'm not going to hold on to any of
[50:51] these the things that you've got why
[50:53] because people people want to come and
[50:55] play church and and all these things but
[50:56] you know what he never gets them
[50:57] anywhere
[51:01] but what we need to have we need to have
[51:03] an old-fashioned
[51:05] x2 experience where we know where that
[51:08] we stand and know what god who god is
[51:11] and actually know that we are standing
[51:13] on the words
[51:14] [Music]
[51:16] what god has called us to
[51:21] that's do
[51:26] because you know many times people want
[51:28] to sing i'm one of them i'm one of them
[51:30] but you know the thing is it comes a
[51:32] time not just to be singing or saying it
[51:34] but it comes time to prove it
[51:37] it comes time that you've got to stand
[51:39] and prove who you are
[51:41] and david come out there and there he
[51:43] was standing there and he began to prove
[51:45] who he was
[51:47] he said no
[51:49] and so dave you know saul finally just
[51:51] told david listen you you go about your
[51:53] own business you you do that
[51:57] well because he had to shake all that
[51:58] off
[52:01] and many times you know that's the way
[52:02] it has to be you got to stand out there
[52:04] all by not only you have to argue with
[52:06] people no not argue but you know you've
[52:07] got to state your case just like david
[52:09] did he let him he let everybody know
[52:11] where he was at but no doubt everybody
[52:13] stood there watch david
[52:15] as he walked out
[52:16] there
[52:18] this boy's getting it
[52:21] yeah
[52:23] this is just gonna be bad
[52:26] and it's just like you know everybody
[52:27] talks about you know watching a car
[52:29] wreck you know you know it's gonna be
[52:30] bad but you can't take your eyes off of
[52:32] it
[52:34] but you know it didn't it didn't faze
[52:36] david
[52:37] it didn't faze him at all
[52:41] because he knew who he was and he knew
[52:43] who what god had called him
[52:45] so when he began to walk out there you
[52:46] know he didn't have to worry about it
[52:49] he knew where he was standing
[52:53] so he just went he just went on about
[52:54] his business
[52:56] to do the thing that god called him to
[52:57] do
[53:02] so brother brown was speaking
[53:05] and he's all about you know we've got to
[53:08] come to a place and and you know what we
[53:10] see that
[53:12] he was about people being
[53:14] uh full of the fighting theology and and
[53:17] all these things but you know you got
[53:18] you got to come to a place where you you
[53:21] got to put god to the test
[53:24] and you know he began to talk about
[53:25] these things and and he said you know he
[53:27] said there has to be a need there has to
[53:30] be a crisis in your life
[53:32] you've got to come to a place where
[53:33] where you meet god and god and you show
[53:36] show god who you are and where you're
[53:38] standing
[53:39] just like david did and he said brother
[53:41] said he said if there ever was a crisis
[53:43] it's now
[53:45] why because now now's the time why
[53:47] because the devil's on the on the on the
[53:49] rampage
[53:51] we see all these things that are coming
[53:53] about
[53:56] but then now now is the time that you
[53:58] prove who god is
[54:00] [Music]
[54:02] you know and a lot of people they they
[54:04] they get tired and they get weary and
[54:06] and you know you know people get
[54:09] you know they begin to almost like lose
[54:11] their faith and and you know they begin
[54:13] to you know just get run down with
[54:14] things and and you know and the thing is
[54:16] and now's the time
[54:19] and all in all the times that you that
[54:21] you have that you're facing all these
[54:23] things
[54:24] now's the time to put god to the test
[54:26] and do it and take god at his word and
[54:29] put god to the test and show that he'll
[54:31] come on the scene
[54:35] because you know many times you know
[54:37] brother speaking and talking about in
[54:38] the coming in the people coming in the
[54:40] prayer lines
[54:42] you know he said you know people come in
[54:44] and you know and they don't even come in
[54:46] the right mental attitude
[54:48] to come into the prayer line
[54:51] and he said he said he said
[54:52] born again christian people will come in
[54:54] he said don't miss their healing
[54:56] but he said he said you get some
[54:58] prostitute off the street can come in
[55:00] and get healed
[55:02] well because she knows how to approach
[55:04] god
[55:06] anyone when people come in and they and
[55:08] they're standing there and and you know
[55:10] brother branham began to in the in under
[55:12] discernment he began to speak to these
[55:14] people and he was standing there and he
[55:15] said
[55:17] he said you didn't realize that you had
[55:18] that much faith
[55:21] and he began to call him out and tell
[55:22] him said you were just praying
[55:24] lord speak have that man speak to me
[55:27] but he said you didn't realize you had
[55:28] that much faith
[55:30] and lots of times he'd tell people hey
[55:31] just call him by name and tell them that
[55:33] you know you're already healed
[55:35] that's right it's already left you
[55:37] right amen
[55:38] well but but see they're they're out
[55:41] there praying for something to take
[55:42] place and then brother madam begins to
[55:43] identify to them hey you know you're
[55:45] already healed
[55:46] it's already gone it's already left you
[55:49] and they don't even realize that they're
[55:50] free
[55:52] that that's already that's that has
[55:54] there's been a change there they don't
[55:56] even realize that until brother brandon
[55:58] begins to speak on that
[56:00] we see all the you know all these things
[56:02] brought around and began to speak
[56:04] about all these things and you know all
[56:06] the things that
[56:08] have has taken place and
[56:10] uh i just wonder i just want to read a
[56:13] couple of quotes here
[56:16] and this is from jesus christ the same
[56:18] yesterday today and forever
[56:20] this is number three brothers and he
[56:22] says in this time jesus had done done
[56:25] great things in in these early days in
[56:27] his early ministry he was misunderstood
[56:30] as most everyone
[56:33] so you know there's going to be times
[56:35] when you're when you're misunderstood
[56:38] he said did you ever come to think of it
[56:40] that most men who ever do anything great
[56:43] for the kingdom of god stand alone
[56:46] did you ever think of it
[56:47] you have to stand by yourself jesus
[56:49] stood alone and all down through the
[56:51] ages other men who stood alone
[56:54] vinnie sankey calvin knox even abraham
[56:57] lincoln that's right stood alone men who
[56:58] do great things meant a vision men of
[57:01] spiritual understanding stand alone
[57:04] he said i think that's because that
[57:06] jesus had to stand alone himself
[57:08] he said now the principle is being here
[57:11] trying to help you
[57:12] and only the only way that i know
[57:14] christian friends to help you is to get
[57:16] your faith
[57:18] the best that i can by the word of god
[57:21] centered on the will of god for you
[57:24] see if you can only see that it's god's
[57:28] will to do these things for you
[57:31] it's god's will to save you
[57:33] to save you all it's god's will to heal
[57:36] you all and he will certainly lead you
[57:38] into deeper depths and higher heights if
[57:41] you'll just trust him
[57:43] he said don't be satisfied with your
[57:44] fire built here from last night
[57:47] let's build it a little farther up the
[57:49] road tonight
[57:50] never build it in the same place you
[57:52] can't stand still he said you're either
[57:54] backsliding or you're going forward
[57:57] so when he began to speak if we're going
[57:59] to do great things for god then you know
[58:00] what we've got to be moving on
[58:03] and we've got to and many times you're
[58:04] going to be standing alone
[58:06] and god has called us his place to stand
[58:08] alone
[58:10] but god but god has a place for you
[58:13] amen and he and it i love that where he
[58:15] said he said i want you to get your
[58:17] faith centered on what the will of god
[58:19] is for you
[58:20] that's the best thing that somebody can
[58:22] do is show you what the will of god is
[58:24] for your life
[58:26] and many times it's it's you know we can
[58:28] speak we can speak the word but it takes
[58:30] god to speak to you to put you where you
[58:32] need to be to answer your specific
[58:34] question
[58:36] now i can't i can't just call somebody's
[58:38] name and tell them what they have need
[58:39] of but but i can tell you what i can
[58:42] stand here tonight and be a and be in a
[58:43] vessel that god can speak through to
[58:46] speak to you and whatever you have need
[58:48] of will speak to whatever your situation
[58:50] is
[58:51] well because there's many times that
[58:53] somebody they'll be preaching on
[58:54] something that's totally different than
[58:56] what but god will speak to me in a way
[58:59] well because the spirit moves
[59:01] and and the veil's broke and all of a
[59:03] sudden something takes place and even
[59:05] when he reveals his word it'll be
[59:06] totally off to the subject of what
[59:08] they're preaching on but some that will
[59:10] be quickened by that the lord will speak
[59:12] to you and give you what you have needed
[59:17] and someone you know when we come to the
[59:19] house of god and we and we gather and we
[59:21] listen
[59:22] then you know it's not just you know the
[59:25] devil wants to stand in your way
[59:29] the devil wants to try to hinder you and
[59:30] all in every aspect of that
[59:39] well we see
[59:41] brother branham was speaking here this
[59:42] is this is from the message the
[59:44] ever-present water from the rock
[59:48] and this is number four and and brother
[59:50] ram says he said you see many times
[59:52] people thinks
[59:53] that
[59:54] a prophetic gift that god just says i'll
[59:57] pick you up right here and set you down
[59:59] here
[1:00:01] now you just go right over here and
[1:00:05] and says
[1:00:07] and he doesn't tell you
[1:00:09] and he doesn't tell you all those things
[1:00:11] if he did then what overcoming faith did
[1:00:14] you have
[1:00:16] see see
[1:00:17] he lets you stand alone more than
[1:00:19] anybody else see
[1:00:21] you all can come to me and ask for
[1:00:23] certain things and he's never failed yet
[1:00:26] but what he gives you the answer
[1:00:29] right
[1:00:31] that's right yeah
[1:00:32] i can go ask him for things for myself
[1:00:35] and many times he just leaves me alone
[1:00:37] see
[1:00:38] just let me go ahead and walk into it i
[1:00:42] have things now that i have to solve out
[1:00:44] myself and decisions i have to make
[1:00:46] and this is such a vital one till i
[1:00:49] cannot exactly make it until i'm sure
[1:00:51] that it's him speaking to me
[1:00:54] and and he won't give me a vision
[1:00:56] he just lets me alone so i'm just
[1:00:58] setting as an orphan like this morning i
[1:01:01] don't know which way to turn so i have
[1:01:03] committed it to the lord
[1:01:07] so when you think uh this prophetic gift
[1:01:09] that brother branham had you know it
[1:01:11] wasn't for him
[1:01:14] you know because when when even even
[1:01:16] when they had the car accident
[1:01:19] and you know when when he was laying
[1:01:20] there and you know the the testimony has
[1:01:22] been that you know he couldn't pray for
[1:01:24] himself
[1:01:26] when billy paul got to him but you know
[1:01:28] what he could reach back through the
[1:01:29] window and he said get give me mama's
[1:01:31] hand
[1:01:32] and he got to hold a sister meet his
[1:01:34] hand and he could pray for her
[1:01:36] but it didn't but it wasn't for him
[1:01:39] and when he came see it was it wasn't
[1:01:41] for him why because if the lord just
[1:01:43] told him to be a zombie right he just
[1:01:46] and just you know walk this way walk
[1:01:49] that way
[1:01:51] you know just like just like people
[1:01:52] think you know predestination you know
[1:01:54] you just you know you don't have any
[1:01:56] control you don't have any say
[1:02:01] it's just like you know
[1:02:03] it's like
[1:02:04] it's time a predestination of the days
[1:02:06] like you know what's so funny he's like
[1:02:07] it's like you know all of a sudden your
[1:02:08] legs start moving you start walking he's
[1:02:09] like well i don't know what i'm doing
[1:02:11] i'm just walking this way you know then
[1:02:12] your arms start moving it's like what is
[1:02:14] it i don't know
[1:02:17] but that's how people look at it it's
[1:02:18] like you know you just you know you're
[1:02:20] just i'm just i'm being loud of the lord
[1:02:22] it's like well i don't even think you
[1:02:23] know just i just get up move
[1:02:27] no
[1:02:28] he knows what your what your desire is
[1:02:30] he knows the things that you're going to
[1:02:32] do
[1:02:34] and that works into his perfect plan
[1:02:40] so you know it's not it's not like you
[1:02:42] know we're just you know he's he's a
[1:02:44] puppet master and he's just moving all
[1:02:45] the strings and we're just going right
[1:02:47] along with it
[1:02:49] no
[1:02:49] god has a choice for you to make it
[1:02:53] believe that so if if i have a desire
[1:02:56] and if i have then god knows what desire
[1:02:58] i was you know and the decisions i would
[1:03:00] make he would know the mistakes i made
[1:03:03] and you know what he he would know that
[1:03:05] ahead of time so you know what none of
[1:03:06] that ever took him by surprise
[1:03:10] so you know you know what all these
[1:03:12] things that he knew what was going to
[1:03:13] take place in the end he knew the
[1:03:15] beginning from there so he knew how all
[1:03:17] of it would take place
[1:03:19] so then that there is an overcoming
[1:03:22] absolutely
[1:03:24] and so many times you know you know when
[1:03:26] when you walk with god you know he he
[1:03:28] leaves you just like brother man said
[1:03:29] it's just like an orphan he puts you in
[1:03:31] places that you're going to decide
[1:03:32] whether you're going to what you're
[1:03:34] going to do and he's going to see what
[1:03:35] you'll do
[1:03:38] see just like joke he knew he knew who
[1:03:40] job was because he he spoke to satan and
[1:03:43] told him said have you considered my
[1:03:45] servant job he knew what kind of person
[1:03:46] job was but he wanted to show job who he
[1:03:48] was all right
[1:03:50] all the way through the scripture
[1:03:52] everybody you'll see somebody as brother
[1:03:54] said all these people are standing alone
[1:03:56] right i was listening and brother i was
[1:04:00] speaking i was listening and he was
[1:04:01] speaking on daniel you know and daniel
[1:04:03] being out there you know daniel knew
[1:04:05] that when they made the decree that he
[1:04:07] couldn't pray to his god
[1:04:09] you know it didn't stop daniel
[1:04:11] brotherham said that daniel went right
[1:04:13] then and went and got in the in the
[1:04:15] window and opened it up and prayed just
[1:04:16] like he did every other time
[1:04:18] well because he wasn't he wasn't afraid
[1:04:20] of what the men's law said
[1:04:23] and you know what he identified quickly
[1:04:26] he went right on the wrist right that
[1:04:28] that second he wanted him to know where
[1:04:29] i was standing
[1:04:32] well you know what you tell me i can't i
[1:04:34] can't pray to my god well guess what
[1:04:35] i'll show you
[1:04:37] i'm not changing i'm not changing for
[1:04:39] you or anybody else why because i know
[1:04:40] who's the living god
[1:04:43] i know who god is and i know what what
[1:04:45] he's what he's capable of
[1:04:47] and what he's done for me
[1:04:49] and i know that y'all are only doing
[1:04:50] this to get back at me to try to hinder
[1:04:53] me because they didn't like daniel
[1:04:57] it's always he always got those ones
[1:04:59] everybody's got to be jealous of
[1:05:00] somebody else why because that but
[1:05:01] that's satan's plan
[1:05:03] right
[1:05:05] i mean you know that's that's one of the
[1:05:08] most terrible things that you see people
[1:05:10] get so eat up with jealousy
[1:05:13] one of one another and they just and you
[1:05:15] know
[1:05:16] it's just like they they talk about you
[1:05:17] know carrying grudges and and having
[1:05:20] having jealousy and all these type
[1:05:22] things you know it's just like they say
[1:05:24] it's like drinking poison
[1:05:26] and expecting the other person to die
[1:05:30] you try you're trying to get back at
[1:05:32] somebody by carrying a grudge
[1:05:36] you know i told that story years ago
[1:05:37] about about that teacher that had all
[1:05:39] those kids and she wanted to teach them
[1:05:40] a lesson so she had a bunch of potatoes
[1:05:42] and a bunch of sacks
[1:05:44] and she took them out there and she told
[1:05:46] them said listen i want you all to write
[1:05:47] down every grievance that you have
[1:05:50] every grudge every problem everything
[1:05:52] that you've got against somebody
[1:05:53] everything that you the resentment
[1:05:55] whatever you got she said i want you to
[1:05:56] write it on a potato and put it in a
[1:05:58] sack
[1:06:00] and she said i want you to carry them
[1:06:01] sacks around with you day in day out
[1:06:04] sleep with them everywhere you go when
[1:06:05] you come to school you better have them
[1:06:09] so you know what they started carrying
[1:06:10] them potatoes around all the time well
[1:06:12] you know what after a while them tata
[1:06:14] started rotting
[1:06:16] but you know what she still made them
[1:06:18] carry them potatoes
[1:06:20] and then all of a sudden not only that
[1:06:22] you know here they go and they start to
[1:06:23] stink and next thing you know they're
[1:06:24] starting to stop those drips start
[1:06:26] coming out of them bags
[1:06:30] but you know here they are toting them
[1:06:31] sacks around everywhere they go come to
[1:06:34] school can you imagine the school room
[1:06:35] and everybody setting them things down
[1:06:37] and whoo
[1:06:39] but you know what it taught them a
[1:06:41] lesson because she said see that's what
[1:06:43] happens when you carry downward grudges
[1:06:45] when you're carrying this resentment and
[1:06:47] you don't get rid of it
[1:06:49] one because you you said you you saw how
[1:06:51] how much you hated carrying these sacks
[1:06:53] around and you how much know how much
[1:06:56] nasty mess they are and the smell and
[1:06:58] all that and it's the same way with you
[1:06:59] carrying a grudge
[1:07:02] well because it's something that's going
[1:07:03] to stand in your way that's going to
[1:07:05] hinder you from going on with god and
[1:07:08] you're growing and everything else
[1:07:09] because you know and nobody wants to be
[1:07:11] around you
[1:07:14] if somebody come around carrying a you
[1:07:15] know
[1:07:16] a sack of rotten potatoes how many
[1:07:18] people want to come up to them
[1:07:20] so you can stand right over there
[1:07:23] and then take a step back
[1:07:26] we don't want to we don't you know and
[1:07:28] it's the same way
[1:07:31] but you know what if you can
[1:07:34] get in the spirit of god
[1:07:37] you know if you if you if you become
[1:07:39] under that the spirit of god you know
[1:07:42] you know and you know because
[1:07:44] you you can you can be born again and
[1:07:46] still have and still carry a grudge and
[1:07:48] you you can be born again and still be
[1:07:50] you know still
[1:07:52] make your life make your life miserable
[1:07:53] you make everybody else miserable too
[1:07:56] but you know what you can be an
[1:07:57] overcomer and have and have a sweet
[1:08:00] disposition about you right now where
[1:08:02] people just can't wait to get around you
[1:08:07] but you know that that's your choice
[1:08:08] what kind of what kind of life you're
[1:08:10] going to live what kind of fruits you're
[1:08:12] going to produce
[1:08:13] that's totally up to you but but you
[1:08:15] have to make that decision right
[1:08:21] so
[1:08:22] we see when when all these things were
[1:08:24] coming
[1:08:26] you know when
[1:08:27] david when he went out there
[1:08:30] you know he went down into that valley
[1:08:32] to fight
[1:08:33] fight goliath
[1:08:35] and everybody else was watching him to
[1:08:37] see what he's going to do
[1:08:38] and he walks out there
[1:08:40] and he walks down into that valley down
[1:08:42] to that creek
[1:08:43] that little stream and he gets those
[1:08:45] rocks up
[1:08:46] and here he comes you know carrying
[1:08:47] those rocks puts them in his bag and he
[1:08:50] goes out there
[1:08:52] well then all of a sudden you know
[1:08:53] goliath becomes incredulous that they
[1:08:55] said this is all you're going to send me
[1:08:59] i've been doing this for 40 days
[1:09:01] day and night i've been coming out here
[1:09:02] calling for somebody and y'all gonna
[1:09:04] send me this little
[1:09:05] shrimp
[1:09:07] you're gonna send me this little twerp
[1:09:08] out here and that's what you that
[1:09:11] y'all that's all you're gonna send me
[1:09:14] and he's like you know i'm just gonna
[1:09:15] stick you on the end of my spirit i'm
[1:09:16] gonna stick you up and feed you to the
[1:09:17] birds
[1:09:20] you know he was like he just couldn't
[1:09:21] believe that all you said all this army
[1:09:23] in a ray you've done all this and this
[1:09:25] is the best you got that's all you're
[1:09:26] going to do
[1:09:29] and no no doubt goliath every time he
[1:09:31] come out there he looked at him you know
[1:09:32] he saw the fear in their eyes
[1:09:36] because you know that they just fed his
[1:09:38] ego oh
[1:09:40] just kept going and all of a sudden when
[1:09:42] he came out there dave was like listen
[1:09:44] i want to tell you something
[1:09:46] you come at me and you find
[1:09:49] military armor and all this stuff and
[1:09:51] your spear and your sword and all this
[1:09:53] kind of stuff and i'm tired of listening
[1:09:55] to your mouth but i've heard it all but
[1:09:58] let me tell you something you come with
[1:10:00] at me and all your training all that
[1:10:02] kind of stuff but i've got somebody i'm
[1:10:04] going to tell you about i'm coming in
[1:10:05] the name of the lord of the god of
[1:10:08] israel
[1:10:10] and this is his army and i'm coming in
[1:10:13] his in his
[1:10:14] stead and i am anointed of god
[1:10:19] and i'm going to stand before you
[1:10:21] and i'm going to tell you something i've
[1:10:23] heard you talk but that's the last time
[1:10:25] you're going to be talking because i
[1:10:27] want you to know something today i'm
[1:10:29] going to take your head off
[1:10:32] and then you know all this is going to
[1:10:33] be over with right soon
[1:10:36] you know and glad that you know he was i
[1:10:38] mean he was just beside himself with
[1:10:40] what was going to take place
[1:10:42] that he couldn't believe this little guy
[1:10:43] was telling him this
[1:10:46] but you know david went out there and he
[1:10:48] had to pick that stone and put in that
[1:10:50] sling then you know what he didn't worry
[1:10:52] about where he was slinging it right man
[1:10:54] that's right you know because i i i with
[1:10:58] everything that was within me it didn't
[1:10:59] matter where david slowed that slung
[1:11:01] that rock all he had to do was throw it
[1:11:03] right
[1:11:04] that's all he had to do was put it in
[1:11:05] there and sling that thing around and
[1:11:06] sing it why because the
[1:11:08] the lord took a hold of that rock and
[1:11:10] put it exactly where it needed to go and
[1:11:13] it didn't matter if he threw it
[1:11:14] backwards or straight up in the air it
[1:11:16] would have ended up exactly where god
[1:11:18] wanted it to end
[1:11:20] but i'm sure david went out there and
[1:11:22] slung that thing around and he and he
[1:11:23] let it go why because there was
[1:11:25] something that stirred up inside of him
[1:11:27] and no doubt he probably got his arm all
[1:11:29] wound up and he was really doing
[1:11:30] something
[1:11:32] he came out there and he slung that rock
[1:11:35] out
[1:11:36] he let it go
[1:11:38] and it went exactly where it was
[1:11:40] supposed to go
[1:11:42] and all of a sudden goliath's standing
[1:11:43] there and you know
[1:11:44] what kind of what kind of deal do you
[1:11:46] think when you when you're
[1:11:48] nine foot tall ten foot tall however
[1:11:50] tall he was
[1:11:52] you know this great big massive man and
[1:11:53] you see this guy will come out there
[1:11:55] slinging a rock at you
[1:11:57] i got a helmet that's an inch thick
[1:12:03] and you're thinking about all the things
[1:12:04] that goes through his mind about you
[1:12:06] know what all this stuff that he's
[1:12:08] standing there thinking about and then
[1:12:10] all of a sudden the last thing that goes
[1:12:11] through glass mind is david's rock
[1:12:19] but i mean he stood there but you know
[1:12:21] what david done exactly what he said he
[1:12:23] was going to do why because he knew who
[1:12:25] he was and when he went out there he did
[1:12:28] exactly what he was going to do and then
[1:12:29] all of a sudden then he went out there
[1:12:31] and he pulled that goliath sword and he
[1:12:33] cut his head off
[1:12:36] and then all of a sudden when he raised
[1:12:38] that when he raised goliath's head up
[1:12:42] and he stood there and he stood on back
[1:12:44] of glass back and he stood and shoulder
[1:12:46] showed everybody here's your here's your
[1:12:48] champion
[1:12:51] here's here's the man that gives you all
[1:12:53] of your your faith
[1:12:55] and gives you all your strength and
[1:12:57] everything
[1:12:59] here he is
[1:13:01] oh yeah as long as goliath was out there
[1:13:02] you know it's like i can handle this
[1:13:05] then all of a sudden when goliath is
[1:13:07] dead
[1:13:09] then all of a sudden it changes that's
[1:13:11] right
[1:13:11] then everybody gets their running shoes
[1:13:13] on and they can't run fast enough
[1:13:16] then all of a sudden when this takes
[1:13:18] place then all of a sudden then then you
[1:13:20] see that the the army of israel's like
[1:13:24] did i just see what i thought i saw
[1:13:27] then all of a sudden they they began to
[1:13:28] get faith
[1:13:30] and rise up and next thing you know they
[1:13:31] start chasing the philistines
[1:13:35] you know they and they go to war and
[1:13:37] they begin to chase them and they and
[1:13:38] they chased and they killed them
[1:13:40] they kept chasing them and chasing them
[1:13:41] chasing them until they destroyed them
[1:13:48] and so it's the same way
[1:13:50] god just needs one person
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:55] and it may be you know because we want
[1:13:57] to you know if if a church is going to
[1:13:59] fail if a church is going to succeed
[1:14:01] then it takes the body together
[1:14:03] and you know many times we say well you
[1:14:05] know it's going to be it's going to be
[1:14:06] brother wade it's going to be brother
[1:14:07] bob or whatever no it may be you
[1:14:10] it may be me
[1:14:13] you know maybe maybe the reason why we
[1:14:14] hadn't got to the place that we need to
[1:14:16] be is because each one of us does not
[1:14:18] receive got to the place where we need
[1:14:19] to be
[1:14:21] when we come we all we all have a part
[1:14:23] to play
[1:14:26] you know there's there's no big eyes in
[1:14:28] little use but each one of us has a part
[1:14:30] to play each one of us has a job that
[1:14:32] we're called to do
[1:14:34] that's right
[1:14:35] and if it's going if we're going to be
[1:14:37] successful if the church is going to be
[1:14:39] successful then it takes everybody
[1:14:44] we don't you know because well you know
[1:14:46] i'm just i'm just insignificant well you
[1:14:47] know what
[1:14:49] there's a lot of insignificant parts
[1:14:51] in the body
[1:14:54] and you know and and paul said you know
[1:14:56] even even the uncomplete parts you know
[1:14:58] every every part has a has a function
[1:15:00] and you know because you know no nobody
[1:15:02] nobody wants to do without one little
[1:15:04] part right
[1:15:06] right
[1:15:07] because you know you if you you think
[1:15:09] about just little tiny things
[1:15:12] i mean you know even even if you you get
[1:15:14] something as small as a splinter
[1:15:16] oh yeah you get a splinter in your
[1:15:18] finger
[1:15:20] and you know and and and you know it
[1:15:23] just it just festers and man you just
[1:15:25] mess with that thing and oh my goodness
[1:15:28] and then and how many have you ever had
[1:15:31] a paper cut
[1:15:34] you don't know you have a paper cut till
[1:15:35] you get something in it and all of a
[1:15:36] sudden you feel like you're going to go
[1:15:37] through the roof
[1:15:41] you work you're working in chemicals and
[1:15:43] stuff and you have alcohol different
[1:15:44] things to hit it and then
[1:15:47] it'll it'll stop your whole body
[1:15:51] and it's just and you say well you know
[1:15:52] that's that's insignificant well you
[1:15:54] know what it all plays a part
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:57] and we all we all have that little part
[1:15:59] to play
[1:16:01] but god called us
[1:16:03] to do this to to fulfill the part that
[1:16:06] god called us to
[1:16:09] whatever whatever it is god called you
[1:16:11] to do
[1:16:12] then that's that's we
[1:16:14] be faithful in what god has called you
[1:16:16] to
[1:16:18] god god called us
[1:16:22] into into this body
[1:16:26] and you know and and and jesus had to
[1:16:29] walk alone and all the rest of them and
[1:16:30] you will too
[1:16:33] but you know the thing is is is many
[1:16:34] times it we you look back in and and
[1:16:37] times and and all through the scripture
[1:16:39] and and that's what god wanted he wanted
[1:16:41] one person to believe him
[1:16:46] when you have one person to believe and
[1:16:48] believe the impossible
[1:16:51] god has called you to the empire from
[1:16:53] because you know when you realize where
[1:16:55] you came from
[1:17:00] before the back part of god's mind
[1:17:02] before there was ever anything amen you
[1:17:05] were a part of him amen
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:08] amen
[1:17:10] when you when you look back before there
[1:17:11] was there was anything
[1:17:14] god saw you as an overcomer
[1:17:17] amen that's right
[1:17:19] and then we come down here and we wonder
[1:17:22] if god's going to bless us
[1:17:24] we wonder if god's going to heal us
[1:17:27] if god's going to save our children
[1:17:34] when we don't when we realize where we
[1:17:36] came from and what god and god called us
[1:17:41] and then god called you to believe the
[1:17:43] impossible
[1:17:44] but with god all things are possible
[1:17:48] when you when you you think of mary when
[1:17:51] mary went out there and that was married
[1:17:52] she was standing out there and and
[1:17:55] all the times that she had heard heard
[1:17:57] the priests talk about a virgin shall
[1:17:59] conceive the pro the great prophet
[1:18:01] isaiah speaking of the great things
[1:18:03] that's going to take place that we're
[1:18:04] going to receive a messiah
[1:18:08] why because it was spoken of in the
[1:18:09] scripture
[1:18:12] all the way from genesis all the way
[1:18:13] through each one of them began to speak
[1:18:14] of what was going to take place and when
[1:18:16] they began to see these things that was
[1:18:18] going to take place and then they hear
[1:18:20] all these things and then you know
[1:18:21] everybody says wonder when it's going to
[1:18:22] take place when is it going to take
[1:18:24] place
[1:18:26] but you know what it came a time when it
[1:18:29] when when the angel came to mary
[1:18:33] you know mary didn't marry didn't fit
[1:18:35] the mold for the for the one that the
[1:18:36] messiah was going to come to
[1:18:39] but you know what she fit the mold for
[1:18:40] what god wanted her to do
[1:18:42] that she was going to bring forth the
[1:18:44] same that she was going to fulfill that
[1:18:46] word and let me tell you something
[1:18:48] brothers and sisters brother brother
[1:18:49] random said you know he said the bride
[1:18:51] is just like he was
[1:18:54] that christ he came
[1:18:57] and he was
[1:18:58] stood alone rejected of men but you know
[1:19:01] the bride is the same way
[1:19:03] the bride is called but you know what
[1:19:05] god called you
[1:19:07] god called you to this day to this hour
[1:19:10] to this age to be an overcomer in this
[1:19:12] age he knew where he was going to be
[1:19:14] standing and knew what you was going to
[1:19:15] overcome that you were going to stand
[1:19:18] and do what kind of battles you were
[1:19:19] going to face but you know what he made
[1:19:21] a way for you to overcome he's already
[1:19:23] sent his word and he said he sent his
[1:19:25] word and he and he healed him and he
[1:19:27] delivered them from their destruction
[1:19:30] he made you an overcomer he made you
[1:19:31] more than an overcomer and he brought
[1:19:33] you into this age to be an overcomer to
[1:19:35] fulfill the word of god why because he
[1:19:38] saw in the mind of god what would take
[1:19:39] place
[1:19:41] why because you're going to stand alone
[1:19:42] but brother said the bride would stand
[1:19:44] on the word she would stand alone on the
[1:19:47] word she's called to stand she's called
[1:19:50] to speak
[1:19:51] it's her job one because she god has
[1:19:53] called us to this hour it's our job to
[1:19:56] stand and speak
[1:19:58] well because he came and spoke and he
[1:20:00] said he said the things that i do
[1:20:03] when he began to speak he said he said
[1:20:05] the things that i do shall you do also
[1:20:08] amen well then you know what it was it
[1:20:10] wasn't just speaking to the five-fold
[1:20:12] ministry he just wasn't speaking to the
[1:20:14] pastors he wants me but the thing that
[1:20:17] he done what did he do he began to walk
[1:20:20] in the word that he saw of himself when
[1:20:22] he began to look into the word and he
[1:20:23] began to proclaim the word
[1:20:25] when he began to see the and open up the
[1:20:27] scriptures and said this day this
[1:20:30] scripture is fulfilled well because he
[1:20:32] has anointed me to preach the gospel he
[1:20:35] has anointed me to do these things and
[1:20:37] brothers and sisters that's exactly what
[1:20:39] god has done in this day he's anointed
[1:20:40] the bride to overcome to fulfill the
[1:20:42] word to stand to declare the word to
[1:20:45] this age that like he said he said this
[1:20:48] this eve would stand and declare to the
[1:20:50] world that she won't fall like the last
[1:20:52] one did the first one when she stood
[1:20:55] there and compromised on the word this
[1:20:57] eve is not going to do that brothers and
[1:20:58] sisters that's telling us that we won't
[1:21:00] compromise on the word that we won't
[1:21:02] fall
[1:21:04] but god called us to that place
[1:21:07] many times we said we can have the devil
[1:21:09] stand on it and stand on our shoulders
[1:21:10] and talk in our ear until we just get
[1:21:12] tired of it but let me tell you
[1:21:13] something brother sisters god give us
[1:21:15] enhancements right right
[1:21:17] then the
[1:21:18] brothers and sisters we got to stand up
[1:21:20] and take it and believe it
[1:21:22] i don't have to i don't have to listen
[1:21:24] to the devil's rotten lies
[1:21:26] i don't have to put up with him
[1:21:31] one because you know just like just like
[1:21:33] jesus
[1:21:35] he took by the word and he began to
[1:21:38] speak and he said it is written
[1:21:40] and he tells satan to get behind me amen
[1:21:44] and brothers and sisters is the same way
[1:21:45] with you and i hey man
[1:21:52] sometimes you think you're standing all
[1:21:53] alone
[1:21:54] and it's like well you know
[1:21:56] there ain't nobody here but me
[1:22:00] brother brown said when you think you're
[1:22:01] all alone you know what
[1:22:03] the lord's there it's you and god
[1:22:06] he said on this journey he said there's
[1:22:08] no there's no extra room
[1:22:10] it's just you and god
[1:22:13] and you've got to make that
[1:22:14] determination for yourself
[1:22:16] we've got to i've got to make that
[1:22:18] decision for myself whether i'm going to
[1:22:20] walk in and be an overcomer
[1:22:24] if i'm going to overcome if i'm going to
[1:22:25] walk in what god has called me to
[1:22:28] i don't have you know because if if i
[1:22:31] try to if i just sit down and think of
[1:22:33] myself as of being what god called me to
[1:22:36] be you know what i would i would just
[1:22:37] absolutely just like abraham i'd laugh
[1:22:43] because if you know if you look at why
[1:22:45] because you you're not supposed to look
[1:22:46] at yourself
[1:22:49] you're supposed to look at the word the
[1:22:52] word is spoke
[1:22:53] let's see what the word says about us
[1:22:58] just like david when he stood out there
[1:23:01] he walked out there and stood
[1:23:03] and knew who he was
[1:23:06] let's know who we are
[1:23:07] god has called us to tell you who you
[1:23:09] are to speak to you
[1:23:11] to let us know
[1:23:13] that's right
[1:23:14] you're the beloved
[1:23:17] amen to to realize the apple of his eye
[1:23:22] to know what god has done for you and
[1:23:24] brought you to this place
[1:23:28] and you know and all the all the time
[1:23:30] all your journey all the things that
[1:23:31] god's done for you and then he's like
[1:23:32] well you get to the end it's like well
[1:23:33] you know i'm going to leave you on your
[1:23:34] own
[1:23:36] right
[1:23:37] no
[1:23:38] god will be with you that's right that's
[1:23:40] right
[1:23:42] let's all stand and the musicians come
[1:23:44] god has called you to a place
[1:23:48] yeah god puts us in places that we don't
[1:23:50] like to be
[1:23:56] [Music]
[1:23:58] hard battles and trials and stuff but
[1:24:00] you know what
[1:24:02] every time every time you have a a trial
[1:24:05] a battle a temptation whatever comes
[1:24:08] your way he said he gonna make a way
[1:24:11] he gonna he has a way made
[1:24:13] for you to get through
[1:24:16] many times we don't know which way we're
[1:24:18] supposed to go what what the answer is
[1:24:21] but you know what i'm going to put my
[1:24:22] trust in him
[1:24:25] i i you know i don't i don't know what
[1:24:27] the future holds but i know who holds
[1:24:28] the future i know what's going to take
[1:24:31] place
[1:24:33] you know many many times my brother said
[1:24:35] you see things happen you're
[1:24:37] misunderstood
[1:24:39] you don't understand you don't
[1:24:40] understand yourself
[1:24:42] but he understands
[1:24:46] he understands
[1:24:48] i'm so glad that somebody that cares and
[1:24:51] understands
