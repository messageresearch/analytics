witness you were that um we had a sister told my my wife I've never seen love Express I'm bad at quoting so I'm probably going to get the quote the statement all messed up but uh something to that effect I've never seen love Express like the way that you know you could see she looked around and saw all the people from our church working and and staying late and and helping out and all the all the things that had gone into it and you could see it it made an effect on on her and uh and that was there was a young man there too that uh he I just say I'm not going to say names for nothing but he'd been struggling with seeing you know all the all the Hypocrites and stuff that around the message and I think um it really made an effect on him to see something genuine in the people of our church and uh he yeah so I I pass out I'm throwing roses tonight we sure do appreciate everything that that went into it and and uh it just I I can't I just cannot express the appreciation and everything that that our family has to all of you so tonight I'm gonna read from John chapter 20 and just take a little topic um might be a short sermon I know I when I say that you know uh but uh uh just talk about Jesus the gardener Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word tonight Lord Jesus Lord each of us are coming with different needs tonight Lord God we know Lord there's just it seems like a constant stream of prayer requests and needs Lord Jesus but Lord we have a God that's here that can answer every need that can meet every need Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll move among us tonight Lord as we open the doors of our heart Lord Jesus to the Lord to just give you free reign to do what you will Lord Jesus Lord to plant your word in our hearts Lord Jesus to make it live Lord we ask Lord that you'll just feel at Liberty tonight Lord God to make the words that are spoken becoming a living reality in our hearts Lord Jesus to address the situations in our lives Lord we just ask your blessing upon the word now as is spoken in your name amen so John chapter 20 and uh and starting in verse 1 and going down to about verse 15 says the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark under the Sepulcher and seeth the stone taken away from the Sepulcher then she runeth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the Sepulcher and we know not where they have laid him Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the Sepulcher so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter and came first to the Sepulcher and he's stooping down and looking inside the linen clothes lying yet when he not in then come of psalmouth Peter following him and went into the Sepulcher and see if the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself then went in also that other disciple which came first to the Sepulcher and he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must Rise Again from the dead then the disciples went away again under their own home but Mary stood without a disciple weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the Sepulcher and see if two angels in whites sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet were the body of Jesus had lean and they say unto her woman why we bestow she saith unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus Jesus saith unto her woman while weepest thou whom seeketh thou she's supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away the Lord had his Blessing to the word you may be seated I I think you know when the problem of God if we could just kind of start meditating on on this scene as it opens up to us to think about how that God uh he in his in his foreknowledge and the way he just planned this scene out he had Jesus Jesus bird was buried in uh there in in a in a garden tomb not just a tomb but a garden tomb so that when when uh he rose from the grave that this little scene could play out and you think about what that Garden tomb must have looked like it was it wasn't just some dreary looking little place but flowers all over around and things planted and things blooming and and uh and so Barry she she was she was looking for the gardener she thought Jesus was the gardener and you know Jesus was not that Gardener not that Gardener of that of that Garden but maybe just take a little topic for tonight just to kind of study it out that he he is a gardener and and you know Isaac Watts was a songwriter in the 1600s and and Charles Spurgeon uh referred to a lot of his songs and he had a little song that went like this we are garden walled around Chosen and made peculiar ground a little spot enclosed by Grace out of the world's wide Wilderness now if you take that thought and kind of think about how the God has pulled us out of all of the our our spot in life are our natural spot and pulled us in and planted us into a garden and where where we can flourish and put put us in the ground and and uh like one little scripture will say in the Bible that he he'll dig around and and put dung their fertilizer and and get you all situated so that you can grow real good and he's got us walled in around so that we're protected and and and he's he's taking care of us and that's what a gardener does is he makes sure that the plants and everything is are growing right now so here we are sitting in this building and if you think of us that brother Brown would refer to the Saints a lot of times as flowers you know how you don't mix up flowers you want to be happy the way that you are the kind of flower that God has made made you you don't want to try to say well I don't like the way the flower that I am so I'm just going to mix everything up you want to because God is God is he's made us a flower he's made us a garden and now you you think now really sometimes we make the gospel so complicated and so hard to understand but God has made it he made it in a way that using all these analogies and things of of planting something in the ground and uh something coming up that you could go take this gospel into the deepest darkest jungle and preach the Seven Seals now this is my conviction you could preach the Seven Seals and you could preach the most seems like the most complicated doctrines just talking about plants growing in the field and I believe that that's what God the way that God wrote the Bible was so that the simple you don't have to have a great big mind a great PhD or something to understand it it's something that you can just go out in the field and and and listen to maybe like John John Wesley would be standing out in the middle of a field and start talking about nature watch the sun rise and the sunset watch the leaves fall off the tree in the fall and they'll come back the next year and you know there's got to be a resurrection because life goes down and it comes back up everything that you can see in nature so we see as we're looking at we're looking at God's Guard we're talking about God's Garden you can see that you can see these deep things expressed in in what God is laid out for us to be able to understand even in the Song of Solomon it says Thou that dwellest in the gardens now you think about this is the way that the shulamite woman referred to to Solomon or the bride referring to to God thou that dwelleth in the gardens that God is is that's where he makes his Abode because he's he wants to he wants to make sure that this crop comes up right he wants to make sure that you have everything that you need to flourish thou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken to thy voice calls me to hear it so he's walking in the garden and he and we want to hear his voice now Isaiah listen to this now it says now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his Vineyard that sounds like it comes from the song with Solomon did but it's coming from Isaiah Isaiah chapter five my beloved my will well beloved half a Vineyard and a very fruitful Hill and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choices Vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a wine preserion and he looked at it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes The Vineyard of the lord of the hosts is the house of Israel and the men of Judah his Pleasant plan so who's the vineyard of the Lord is the house of the House of Israel and this now is the the the the true seed of Israel right here the seed the uh that I'm looking at and the men of Judah his Pleasant plan so you are his garden you are the Lord's garden now now Gardner is a person who tends and and cultivates a garden as a Pastime or for a living it's somebody that goes through the garden and make sure that it's it's doing right in the Bible doesn't really refer to a gardener as a gardener the Bible refers to a gardener as as a husbandman so when you read the Bible it says it's talking about when it says husband man it's talking about a gardener and and this Gardener now in Matthew Chapter 13 it says he the soweth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed or the children of the Kingdom so this Gardener that we're talking about is that somebody he's going around sowing he's trying to plant something in the ground and what he's sowing he's sowing the Bible says the field is the world a good seed are the children of the Kingdom now James I'm gonna run through some scriptures kind of faster and then we'll kind of get into the to the meat of this and maybe not be too long tonight as I as I warned you James chapter 5 7 says be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain so now what's the gardener doing the gardener knows that sometimes it takes a while for that crop to come up you plant that seed down in the ground and you've tried to find some good ground to plant it in and and then you wait and you're patient the husbandman The Gardener is waiting for the precious fruit of the earth now he planted something down in the very beginning and he waited and waited down through seven Church ages for it to come up in the mature and now he's finally seeing the fruits of all of his all of his all of his sacrifice all of what he did there on the cross he's seeing the whole plan being fulfilled of course you know when you when the whole plan is is is is done and completed you can take the whole seal off and see what God has done but the gardener what's the gardener doing he's waiting for the fruit maybe I could express this afternoon known it that God wants to see you bear fruit God if God is The Gardener of your life he wants to give you everything that you have need of he wants to give you he wants to plant the right thing and the ground of your heart he wants to plant the right thing in you and he wants to give you the right or the right nourishment and the right Reign and and dig around you and put fertilizer there so that you have everything you need to grow up now in Luke Chapter 13 it says there's a parable that Jesus said and it's a parable that we Overlook a lot of times he says he spake also this Parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard and he came and saw fruit there on and found none then said he under the dresser of his Vineyard behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why come birth at the ground Now isn't that how a lot of times we look at it well maybe we'll look at our own life for the life of our family or something and say Well they're never going to come to church they're never they're never going to get their bear fruit and and this this dresser this person was saying to the dresser of the vineyard to The Gardener he's saying why don't you just cut this thing down and the gardener he answered and he said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut down so let I want to say this afternoon let God work with the tree a little bit before giving up on it let God work with that fig tree a little bit before giving up on it but let God work with that with your children a little bit before giving on it up on it and saying well just cut it down that person in the church that seems like they're not doing what they're supposed to do or whatever let the gardener have at it and that's what the gardener is supposed he's got his pruning shears in his hand when we come to church that's what we come to church for to get to get the things cut off of our life that that are causing us that are hindering us to be able to develop fruit right if we'll just be patient and wait on the Lord The Gardener will have his perfect work than us that you see none of that fruit none of the fruit would come without first planting the seed none of that fruit would come none of the fruit that we see here would come would have ever come without first planting the seed and so we go back to our original story there Jesus coming up out of the ground John chapter 12 says verily verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die at abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it under life eternal so you've got a pattern there all down to the scripture of planning you see God wants to plant his word in you but first his word was planted in the ground and it rose on Easter morning and the reason the purpose for why it was planted in the ground was so it could be planted and you the original sea the original life the original word of God that was with God before the foundation of the world was planted in the Earth was planted in death so that you you could have life and that original life was called a seed the seed this seed which is Christ that seed was planted in the ground in Galatians chapter 3 verse 16 it says now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and deceased them as a many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ in Isaiah 53 verse 10 it says yet it pleased the Lord to Bruce him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days in the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he was the word he was the original Life The Original Seed he was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and brother random said in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said every spoken word of God is the Original Seed I see you oh if you if we could kind of grasp that this morning that when that word was planted that's that word it had it had there had to be it had to produce something when it was planted in the ground it had to rise for to produce life to give life and when that word of God is planted in your heart it's going to produce something if it's planted in good ground if it's planting and ground it's going to produce oh what a promise we've got lay in there this afternoon that if the word if you receive the word of God and it's planted in the good ground of your heart it is going to produce life and I see this afternoon we're not just talking about denominational ideas or on callal ideas or our own thoughts about what's right and wrong but if we take what's laying here in the Bible and receive it in the way that God wants us to receive it it is going to come up and produce something it's going to actually produce the Life of Christ in us because that's what's planted the original word was planted in the ground and cross the word the original word rose up from the ground and when it's planted in your heart the original word will rise up in your life and produce itself again brother Adam said every spoken word of God is the Original Seed God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the Original Seed it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again as long as you see stay with that original see why because that original C is the word of God it's God himself in letter form and when you receive it in your heart it comes off the page into a spiritual a spiritual life manifesting God himself that's what the gardener is trying to do he's trying to sow the word plant the seed plant the seed in your life and he's looking for good ground to do it the Bible says that he said I am the resurrection of the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live that means his lead Christ did that you will do also Healing The Sick and raising the dead because the Life of Christ is manifested in you God is a Master Gardener a master husbandman a master a Master Gardener is somebody that knows every in and out of what to do how to cast out Devils how to how to give nourishment to the plant what to cut off when and where what kind of bug is good or bad a Master Gardener know what knows what's right for his church if the church is the garden that first corn of wheat was planted in the earth's Earth so that you could have a life in Genesis chapter 2 verse 8 and 9 it says that the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden see God's all about Gardens and and verse 9 out of the ground may the Lord God to grow every tree because he's a Gardener He's a Master Gardener a husbandman and he made out of the ground to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the side and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil an every believer every believer in Christ is connected to his planning and death because he was planning so that we can have life through him in John chapter 15 he said I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman my father is the gardener every branch of me that beareth not fruit he'd taketh away in every branch that bearth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clinging through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the sin the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so there's we've got a principle of Life laying there that if you plant a seed in good ground and you water it it will produce if you plant a seed in good ground and water it it is God is going to produce now all through the scripture we've got this this story of God's Garden we've got Gardens All Through the Bible you can read about seeds the Tree of Life the tree planted by the rivers of water the Fig Tree and the bride tree there's Vines and trees and rain there's rain that Elijah said there that rain ain't going to fall until I call for it and then the rain fell after he got everything in order again after he killed all the priests of Baal and Baal is we'll get into later is a is a rain God a fertility God and they will worship in the rain God and when when when when when when Elijah killed all the priests of Baal then the rain fell from the real God the wheat and the tares and all the little foxes that spoil the vine that get in there and mess up the garden that you've got to take care of because the little the little foxes the little things of Life are the things that we've got to get rid of and there's grafting and there's husbandmen and laborers and there's you that are part of God's garden and Satan's scheme all this time is to keep the garden from growing Satan's scheme is to keep that Garden from what's Satan trying to do he this even this afternoon he's trying to keep you from from hearing the word because he wants to mess up mess he wants to make your heart Stony he wants to let make Thorns grow up so that the word can't be planted he wants to get your mind off on something else gets you distracted he wants to make you think maybe that the preacher don't know what he's talking about or the people in church or this or that and get you distracted this way or that way because the devil is trying to keep the the word of God from being planted in you that what's the devil well the devil's tactic is to introduce something else so that you know hybridization from the very beginning if we'll talk about hybridization you take like a grapefruit and a tangerine and hybridize them together and then you've got a tangelo which can never go back to a grapefruit it can never go back to a tangerine because it's not either one of those things now it's a tangelo you've mixed it all together and so you take the word of God and mix it with something else you'll you'll never be able to reproduce the life Life of Christ it'll never be able to produce the Life of Christ because you've taken it now now see we a lot of times we'll we'll start thinking about like major doctrines and stuff but you can just you can you you take the the raw word of God and mix in with there some lie of the devil that you can't get the the Holy Ghost is not for you or I can't get my healing I've been dealing so long with my predicament or whatever that and now you've mixed it up with something that it won't produce but if you let the word of God be sowed into your heart into good ground it's going to produce and you see what you see as we grow up the stature of the perfect man that's what God is trying to teach to us as our faith is home and and as our as we begin as word precepts upon precept is piled we begin to our mind like brother boy he's been preaching on our mind is actually renewed to begin to realize that these things are possible that all things are possible to them that believe we're early on maybe in our journey we begin to stumble at things and we we maybe we even stumble that whether we were truly born again and the devil would battle at us about those things but then you begin to realize that these things that we really do have a power in the church that we really do have the power of love and forgiveness and that God really is moving in your life and and there really is something and you see all that hybridization is being taken out as we become in Oneness with God Oneness with God is what we're after not one not one that's a Oneness with God will produce Oneness with one another if we'll just get one with if we'll look at Christ if we'll love Christ in the way that we should we'll we'll start loving one another the way that we should also the hybridization is what the devil the devil wants to keep you from believing to think to think that you're you're fine just the way you are I was reading a quote the other day where brother Brown said that's what the devil's tactic is to think that to make you think that whatever wherever you are you'll find the way you are the young people to think that you can post stuff on Tinder and go looking at websites and all kinds of stuff and that you're fine the way you are old people as well that you're fine because that's what the devil's lie is to to make you think well I'm good I'm I'm okay just the way that I am to think it really or to think that it don't really matter what you believe but it does matter because what you believe is what's sown into your heart and what's sown into your heart if it's the original sea the original life is going to produce what you allow to take root in your life is what will grow and manifest oh you see why it's so important to be careful of what you look at and what you listen to and you you start you start listening to some podcast that's got a bunch of weird ideas about what gender people are and all that kind of stuff and before long you you'll start thinking along those lines what you what you what you allow to take root in your life is what will grow and manifest that's why you say it matters it matters what you believe you start you maybe sometimes you come to church and you think well we're just being too critical but no because it matters what's sown in your heart I don't want any weeds or Thorns growing in my ground I want to get all the stones rooted out I want to get all the Thorns rooted out because because it matters now you see you look at Cain's life that hybridized life that that came he wanted to be a a he was like a good a good message believer he was he was at church all the time he was he was worshiping but he he his eye his the way that his when when Abel presented the word to him the true revelation of the hour he said no I don't want that you're going to have to come my way here take that my way of the highway my way is good enough you could take it or leave it and and so Cain was rejected Balaam Balaam that hybridized his hybrid way of thinking was to take his own ideas his own thoughts to say that we're we're just all the same you see why ministers hit on that so much that we're not all the same what makes us different from the rest of the world is what we believe what we believe sets us apart and makes us different what it's Christ that makes us different we're not all the same like Balaam would have you believe we're all the same no there's something that makes us different and a hybrid product what's the difference between a hybrid and and the real the real has life and the hybrid does not have life in it a hybrid product has no life it ain't no good president said it makes a better looking ear but it ain't got no life in it that's the way it makes a better looking church but no life in it hybrid that's right you see the truth the original truth the original life has life in it the Original Seed brings the original life that's where the life comes from because it's that it's that original life the lie that Cain believed was his own works and the fruits the field were sufficient but the truth that Abel believed was that he needed a blood sacrifice and that was life in what Abel believed now see if the life matters if the life matters then the seed matters the seed matters the seed brings a life so it matters what you believe God is still looking for some good planting ground to plant his word somebody that knows that it matters what you believe somebody that's ready to open up their heart to receive God's word no matter what the cost because the Bible says in First Peter chapter 1 verse 23 it says being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever that's actually how we're born again by receiving the word by that word being planted in your life come on now y'all y'all if y'all if y'all agree with this y'all put a little bit y'all making me feel like I I don't y'all don't believe what I'm saying here we're born by the word of God we're not born by so many corruptable words well Incorruptible man's ideas or anything but we're born by the by The Incorruptible word of God now here's here's the meat and potatoes this afternoon that I kind of want to get into is that when Jesus Jesus told this Parable and see how a lot of these deep things that Jesus simplified them down so that we can understand and Jesus told this Parable that about the sower went forth to sow and there was different kinds of ground that the seed went into and then first of all that that he he told about this scenario this situation where the the seed fell by the wayside and the birds of the the of the air came and picked it up plucked it and plucked it away and and so the seed didn't get a chance to root in the ground now what's he talking about in all these Parables I I think we know we we've got the background well we've heard this over and over but what he's what's he talking about he's talking about you he's talking about your ground that he wants to sow his word he's he's the gardener that wants to sow his word in your ground so now it depends whether the word of God takes root and actually manifests it all depends on the ground the ground is the problem the ground is the thing that if we can if we can get our ground tilled up and softened up and so that it's good ground and so now it's going to produce so I want to know what good ground is don't you want to know what good ground is this afternoon because I want the word of God to be produced in my life I want to have the right attitude I want to have the right mindset for the word of God to be able to take root in my life so that it can produce so that others can see Christ in me now now so we've got all these examples of the birds the fowls of the air coming and picking up the seed that fell by the wayside and the others that fell on this Stony ground and the sun just just burn it up because it couldn't take root down enough to get moisture and others where the the Thorns that all these things grew up around and just choked it out now see this this afternoon don't get all drawn up on me now you don't want the orange to choke out the life do you we want to get all the stone out of our if we can get the stone out of our out of our ground and get the Thorns take care of the thorn rip up those thorns stool get rooted and really get a good foothold so that when so that when the rain comes and the storms and the sleet and the snow that you've got you're rooted and it don't bother you anymore because you know what you believe that's what this Parable is talking about a Christian that has received the word so strongly so open themselves up to where God can do something with him now Jesus said he said these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard that for talking about the whether whether uh whether the seed is cast by the wayside it falls by the wayside and it and the birds of the air come and pick it up he said these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard when you've heard it then Here Comes Satan immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts Here Comes Satan as soon as you hear the word as soon as the words preached Here Comes Satan to say well the cloud was really caused by a missile and all of a sudden Here Comes The Devil to take put some idea in your head and Away you go and you stop listening to the word and now now you you the word can't take root in your ground because there's the devil to tell you that well we don't have any newspaper records of exactly how many people fell off the bridge and see these are examples now but let's apply it to your life Here Comes The Devil to tell you well like like that little girl that was healed and brother around his meeting and she was actually healed of being deaf and she went home and started listening to her family and her family told her well I don't think you really got her your healing and what was that doing that was the devil coming to take away that word that had been sown in her heart and now she lost her healing because there was the devil to take it away Here Comes The Devil to tell you well I don't think you can really get the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't think that church has it I don't some people in brother branham's campaign lost their healing well there was a lot of people in brother Baron's campaign that kept their healing listen you know there's so many things to look at like like the the young man that I was talking about at the wedding this Sunday that had looked at so many Hypocrites over the ages but listen that well there's a lot of Hypocrites and a lot of weird stuff that there is a genuine and I that's I was telling my wife the other day that's one of my missions in life is I want to represent this message in a way that's not weird I think the message has been there's so much been so much weird stuff around the message and I heard one preacher preaching on it like this he said that you know the the gospel is for broken people and so it's going to attract a lot of broken people but let's not look at the Brokenness but let's look at what God can do to those broken lives that God can pack somebody up and transform you do you get so looking at all the Hypocrites and all the trash and all the weird stuff going on but there is a real genuine Holy Ghost Field bride that's being transformed by the word that she has received in the good ground of her heart you know all these things that people look at but you know all those nine Visions all the all the different Visions was it seven seven nine how many however many it was the egg-shaped car all those things are coming to pass a nation that's won run by a woman a woman's Nation surely you can look around and see that prophecy is being fulfilled all the things about the Maginot Line and watch Russia not the USSR but Russia watch Russia and now Russia her name was changed from the USSR to Russia to fulfill what brother Brown spoke about all those years ago see the devil the devil will come along and when the word is sown if it's so if it's not sown in good ground the devil will come and try to snatch it away don't let the devil snatch it away maybe tonight they're sitting for somebody sitting here maybe it's for somebody listening in online you know the devil will come along and he'll he'll tell you all kind of he'll say you well you know better than the preacher you're more spiritual than anyone here and boy that's something that'll snatch that seat away you're more Spirit you got a better better this better that better experience you have a greater understanding he'll tell you all kinds of stuff oh that don't that don't apply to you that don't apply to you you're fine but let's see you got to have that good ground because the good ground ground that ain't Stony ground without all the Thorns Grime without the where the devil can't snatch it away where you just let it take root it's going to produce oh brother Bob this is simple but you know the gospel is simple not simple not not the gospel the gospel is simple enough that anybody can receive it and anybody can be changed what's that what's Satan's motive Satan's motive is to discredit the word when the word is preached in truth and in power there's Satan standing right there to come along and say well well I don't think brother Branham was real honest I I I went on believe the sign today and I was looking at all their lists of all their nonsense and stuff that they they said what it is is the devil trying to discredit what God has said that brother Branham was Dishonored that was the most honest man you could he even told the IRS guy that I told I stepped out of my house and and and told my wife to say that I wasn't there and he said well now I really believe you because you were so so honest enough to come and tell me all of these things about the cloud and the bridge and the devil will even try to discredit your testimony you come out you go home and say well I've been healed I feel like I've been come back from a camp meeting and say that God did something to me and there'll be somebody waiting for you when you get back from Camp to say well I don't think you really got it you just were emotional there's somebody somebody that the devil will work through around every corner to discredit your healing to discredit your salvation now you let that word of God take root in your heart enough where nothing could take it away that's what God wants to that word to sink down into that good ground where God can do something with you with a husbandman can be in the world that's what the devil's job is to discredit the preachers to discredit your pastor to discredit your friends to discredit even your good intentions you try to do something good and the devil will be right around the corner to say well well you were trying to do that out of spite or something oh don't you remember the story when David come up upon the scene where they were their Goliath was making his big boast and all of his brothers were standing there to say oh you're just full of mischief you're coming up here just to stir up trouble David wasn't there to stir up trouble but they were that it was the devil trying to discredit his good intentions the devil will even discredit the things you can see with your eyes and hear with your ears he will discredit that you can see a picture of the pillar of fire that was taken by the enemies of this gospel he will try to discredit that and say that it ain't real Satan will do anything he can to keep that seed from being planted you see because if that seed is planted and if it takes root it is going to produce what it's going to produce it's going to produce like Christ when he was planting in the ground he rose up in Victory and power and when it's planted in your life it will rise up in Victory and power the same way because it's the word that's sown in your heart not some man's ideas but it's the word it's the word of God that we believe it's the word of God that we preach it's the word of God that we've heard and received into our hearts thank you the Bible says Jesus said when he was telling that parable of the of the of the the rich man and Lazarus he said unto him well this is Lazarus that told the rich man he said it down down in in the grave he said if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will you that will they be persuaded the one rose from the dead that's a description of somebody where the Devil comes and snatches that seed away because even if you saw like they saw Lazarus sitting there at the table with Jesus but yet they would not believe and I was reading this in the scripture today even the Pharisees actually conspired to kill Lazarus because so many people were believing Jesus could you imagine a situation where man's Hearts would get so hard that they would actually see God's word manifested before them and want to kill the proof of it they wanted to kill Lazarus because they knew that people were being converted because of his presence well I want to say to you this afternoon don't let Satan keep you from believing this word is true this gospel is true and it will produce what it says it will oh now the Bible talks about Jesus talked about the when when the word is sown when the seed is sown on Stony ground and he said these are they likewise which are sown on Stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness so get real happy about it but but it can't take root they have no root in themselves and so endure but for a Time afterward when Affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake immediately they are offended now say see they hurt they hear the good news real and it makes them real excited at first but then then Hard Times come and a lot of times hard times don't really come from maybe from your people you work with so much sometimes hard times come from the people that you go to church with and I I think sometimes that ain't really priests preached too much but that's the truth isn't it sometimes sometimes hard things come hard things offenses might come from a preacher offenses might come from a deacon offenses might come from the people that you live with and sometimes sometimes people people will say stuff at church that's a little bit mean or whatever what are you going to do then if you're not rooted and grounded then what are you going to do you're going to say where you started the race well then off you go listen now I I didn't see that at the beginning of my Christian journey and if it's the beginning of yours maybe you won't see it either you look back down the life life's Road and and see all the ones that have just got so offended it's something that was said listen this gospel is not something that needs to be presented to you in a certain way it might be presented one way it might be presented by old Gruff Peter one way or it might be presented on the silver platter to the other but if it's not always presented on a nice gold platter under a little a little thing where they pull it off with or on a on a satin pillar then you can't say well that's not the word of God it's still a word of God even if it's presented from a donkey's mouth like it was when to Balaam even if it's presented to you from a donkey's mouth it's still the word of God somebody that's where the word is sown on Stony ground see what is it is talking about it's talking about people it's talking about us the this is a parable of us not of out there in the field somewhere the quick starter like that like that rabbit that that can't finish the race somebody that's real excited about church but without that stay in power no endurance because they're not rooted no root and when persecution arise persecutions arise immediately they are what offended or is that forgotten beat attitude that keeps coming up blessed are those that are not offended in me you got to be rooted you got to be rooted so you can stand on your own I I think sometimes that fail we fail to understand that God wants us to stand on our own now what that means though in practice now what that means is if somebody says something rough to you you don't just fly off the handle but you're rooted and you know you know what you know what you're here for you know you're predestinated you're ordained to fulfill the word of God and you don't just go run it off somewhere oh you oh offense such a such a strong thing that Jesus even dealt with in the scripture you you think about even that scenario in the Bible when that little woman was was there washing Jesus's feet and she had went through all the naysayers and all the critics to sit to get down at Jesus's feet and begin to wash it and people mocking her and saying well don't Jesus know who that is and and there was a man Judas over to the side that looked at that scene play out and he started getting offended he started to think well I know better than Jesus he said the Bible says that he says why was not this ointment sold for 300 Pence and given to the poor he started judging that scene now see a lot of times it looks like in our from your from a natural perspective that that would make sense that that you'd want to give to the poor that you want to have a cake line and all those kind of things but but Jesus Judas didn't understand he didn't understand what was happening there and it wasn't long before Judas killed the very thing that he claimed to love because he was offended because he got offended you see that that Stony heart when I see Stones sewn on that Stony ground you start getting Afflicted and you feel like something's something's wrong and you feel like what it what it does just like it did with Judas is you start you start hating the preacher now I'm telling you you start but why why why do people hate the preacher why do people get upset at the preachers because they're preaching something that's trying to line up their life to try to correct their life and they'll start something within them is is causing them to to not like the preacher something within them is like you shouldn't have said it like that you shouldn't have done it like that but what about what about Jesus and that woman washing his feet Judah said it shouldn't have been done like that but and he had a good point maybe that ointment that ointment I read in one place would have been about like like twenty thousand dollars of today's money twenty thousand dollars and that woman she broke that glass and washed Jesus's feet with it haha we get so offended about things we're we're eager to hear we're eager to hear things you know you know brother Ryan was he compared it to like a hot house a hot house plan is a plant that it's not rooted in the ground you gotta you gotta constantly move it from one place to the other so he can get when it's raining and sleeting outside you got to move it into that Greenhouse that hot house plan so that it can be in a nice little spot you got to move it over here and move it over there do it and the hot that little plant might say well am I supposed to deal with this am I supposed to just tolerate this and that might be a question we're asking today am I supposed to just let stuff go and the answer is yes am I supposed to just let stuff go when things go wrong yes I'm supposed to just let it go brother Brown said well the hot house plant will say well I'll never go again this is all there is to it oh my no wonder you can't hold that sword of Faith no wonder you compromise on the words you go somewhere where you can hear some kind of a little sisified something put together because that's what a hot house plant wants the hot house plant doesn't want that good nourishment where it's you're digging up around them and digging up all the stone and all the thorns and everything but you see the Stony ground the Stony ground is a problem with your ground it's a problem with the ground offenses and trials and tests will come but what will you do when they do will you give up will you throw in the towel or you will you be rooted and grounded and stay the course I Stony ground is the problem but let God speak to your heart this afternoon soften up your heart to his word there's a promise in Ezekiel chapter 36 that stonly heart can be softened up made a heart of Flesh yield yourself to him don't be critical don't be skeptical somebody come to church somebody be all critical and everything you're going to get what you expect like brother Adam said don't be hardened to the preacher don't don't want the preacher to struggle but desire to receive from God because your heart you won't you want to have a heart that can receive that word in the good ground into good ground let me just say something here listen you can we I think sometimes we battle so much with offenses and things and we think we think we almost normalize being offended but listen you can come to a place where it don't bother you and God wants you to come to a place where it don't bother you God wants you to come to a place where listen it listen I remember when I started preaching I used to preach about how you need to I was thinking about this one of my very first sermons was you got to come to a place where somebody looks you in the face and says I don't think you got the Holy Ghost and it doesn't bother you he you got to come to that place where somebody if somebody says something rude it doesn't bother you now it gets real quiet here I feel like I feel like it does when brother Louise was preaching well listen I hope I hope I hope you love me bye I thought I thought this was going to be a real uplifting sermon and y'all [Laughter] the Bible says and these which are sown among Thorns such as hear the words and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it become unfruitful now if somebody you think about this now somebody wants to be a good Christian sitting out there and they're hear the word but then all these cares and all these other things begin to begin to grow why because what you what you what you allow to plant in your ground those Thorns have a seed too and you've allowed it to get in your ground and begin to grow up around and choke it out all that all them romance novels you listening to and all that stuff you listen to and all the false preaching and all the and all the wrong ideas that you've allowed to root in your mind and in your heart and what it is somebody looking for a reason to not believe what somebody that's Desiring to be a Christian without being changed I want to be Christian but I still want all these things in the world I still want to I still want to go out and and and Gamble and and I'm I'm skirting around some stuff so I'm so I won't be too rude loving the world more than God loving the when you love the world more than God my my listen my when you say well I I would go to church but now my family is going to be real offended if I go to church so I I'd rather just I I want to I want to make sure that I give more precedence to my family and everything they're having this special event and every other Sunday is having a special event so I'm gonna go over there my family's doing something I want to show them my love and win them over to Christ but that's not how you show the love of Christ you show the love of Christ by by obeying his word and doing what his word says putting God first is that what Jesus said when he was telling all these Parables about he said that all these people were invited to a feast invited to to come and gather and one said well I bought a piece of ground and I must need to go see it I pray they have me excused I bought a piece of ground over here and after I bought it I got to go check it out all these excuses all these reasons all these Thorns that are growing up excuses reasons to not let it is preventing that seed of the word from growing and taking root in you I bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray that he had me excused I bought five yoga oxen and I gotta go see these rather than go to the feast I got to go take care of this over here I've married a wife and therefore I cannot come a thorn a thorn that pokes and hurts and and it when you hear the word of God being preached and but yet it's poking at you my friends won't like me if I live like that I'll be embarrassed if I get up and raise my hands I'll be embarrassed if I say if I if I say Amen I'll be I I can't that thorn that's poking you I can't go to church on Sunday because we got this special event that only happens every now and again and I got to do this because my family wants me to do it and I got to show them love what about God the first commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy Soul that's the first commandment above every other commandment to put God first above everything else above everything else when you want to be popular so you don't you want to you want to dress like the world and live like the world that's that thorn creeping in you want to you go to school and everybody's dressing a certain way and you think well I got to be I got to dip my toe into those worldly Waters that's that thorn creeping in thorns and Pricks are the problems the problem of a heart that's not right so let's get rid of all those Thorns the prickly thoughts and desires all the lust of anything contrary to the world let's get rid of it let's root it all out so that the word of God can be planted in our heart what's all these Thorns all these video games and romance novels and even housework if there's anything that can keep you from the word of God or from doing what God wants you to do from church and from your prayer life which sometimes we even let family interfere with our prayer life we're let with we'll let to think that we would let birthdays and anniversaries interfere with our prayer life and without with our time with God all those Thorns that are creeping in so that the word of God cannot be planted in your heart because it's a heart problem you would rather go to the birthday party or the anniversary party or something than to to go where you're supposed to go what you allow in your field will slowly take over brother right now I was reading this this message where he he was preaching away and he said he said is somebody up in the balcony would say I wonder if he discerned that there was somebody up in the balcony that had a problem he said brother Brown I once had the victory I once was a Godly person but somehow another the wees and the thorns and things has choked me down I'm not where I ought to be I know I'm not pray for me brother Branham now he was asking that asking that to the congregation and and I could repeat those words tonight and ask you that if there's all these storms and things that have encroached on your life to where you know that you're not where you need to be then then maybe tonight that you could just reach out to God by faith and say God forgive me I from now on I want to change I want to be different I want something different in my life I want to get all those storms and all that Stony ground cleared up because I want to have a good ground in my heart where the word of God can take root and be planted and reproduce and that's where the Bible says in Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 8 but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit summon 100fold some 64 some 30-fold in the good ground now that's the kind of ground that we want to be tonight isn't it the kind of ground that can produce fruit there's a promise that if the seed falls into good ground it will bring forth forward I want you to take that home with you tonight and as you're driving home let that Echo around in that space in your skull that there is a promise that if that seed falls into good ground it will bring forth it will bring forth if it falls into good ground so let me be good ground how many wants to bring forth tonight you want to bring forth then be good ground if there's something wrong in my life say oh God take out take out everything that's wrong in my life because I want to be the kind of good ground brother I'm sitting now the seed you people here who are farmers every seed will produce if it's in the right kind of ground and every Divine promise of God in the Bible will produce if it's met in the right kind of a heart it'll produce the promise now every means every every don't mean some but every promise in the Bible will produce if it falls into good ground oh this this might be a simple sermon tonight but it's a rich sermon because it's a promise there that you can lay claim to tonight that if you'll just open up the door of your heart and let that word of God sink down in there and begin to take root and say I believe how do you do that I believe it I believe it despite everything that I see I believe it despite everything that I hear or feel because I'm not looking to my circumstances but I'm looking to the Unseen I'm looking to a real that cannot be discerned by my natural eye I'm looking to the promises of God and that will produce it will produce because it's a promise brother ever said if you have need of Salvation believe that he saved you and accept his sacrificial death and you shall receive what you've asked for if you're in need of Salvation tonight if you'll believe it then you will receive it if you're weary and gloomy and feel like that everyone's against you come unto me all ye that labor in her heavy laden and I will give you rest that's a seed accepted and if you're sick he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we're healed accept it it's a seed we'll produce the whole do you see what that seed is that Original Seed was Christ the sea that was the seed that was with God in John 1 1 and that sea was manifested in flesh and planted in the ground and rose again every word that we preach and every word that we hear was sown by the son of man that means that every word that we're hearing is part of that Original Seed what I'm preaching to you tonight is not just something that I'm making up on the fly but it's the word of God and if you receive it you are receiving God himself let it take root in you and it will reproduce and be born in you that's what what is the seed in Acts chapter 2 it says the promise is to you and to your children to those way off as many as the Lord will call and that's a sea that if you receive it you can receive that promise and James chapter 5 verse 15 it says the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him that's a seed that if you'll take let it take root in your heart tonight right now your sins can be forgiven you if you will believe it oh you think well I've gone too far I've done something too bad I I I I I I need to do Penance and all these things what you need to do is accept what God has already done for you and believe it and let it take root in your life let it take root and make good ground and accept your deliverance the Bible says in James 5 16 the effect sexual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now there's a seed that if we'll take to our prayer chamber something will happen if you go to your prayer chamber and believe that your prayer will do something something will produce in Isaiah 53 it says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed there is something that I can receive for myself and believe and it will produce what will it produce deliverance from my iniquities forgiveness of my sins it will produce healing in my body it'll produce a body change Psalm chapter 103 says oh my soul forget not all his benefits now that's a scripture we quote a lot of times why because we forget we forget what we've got access to that you've got benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases plant I want that seed to be planted in your heart tonight and it will produce will it produce at all your iniquities will be forgiven all your diseases will be healed if you can believe if you can believe it will reproduce Psalm chapter 92 said those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God they shall bring forth fruit and old age they shall be fat and flourishing who's going to flourish those that that Gardener has planted if he's planted you and rooted you'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water those that are planted are going to produce whether when the word if you're when the word is planted in you you got to die to all your ideas for life to be born brother said you have to die you have to die before you can be reborn any seed has to die before it's regenerated again unless it dies it abides alone a man has got to die to his own thinking he's got to die to the thinking of anything but God's word had come his way that's God's ground so if we can die to our pride if we can lay aside all of our pride and lay aside all of our Envy oh if we can lay aside our pride I think that's that holds us back from receiving so many blessings Pride manifests itself in kind of weird forms sometimes sometimes we'll be so prideful that we don't want to admit that there's something wrong in our family or in our children's lives and our pride will try to cover that up and try to try to have this appearance that everything's good but I I want to encourage you just lay your pride on the Altar and just I remember when my kids were going through I've done many things wrong but one thing I did write was I used to tell these ministers and you could testify of it when you preach you feel that Liberty to preach on my kids because we listen if you lay your pride lay your pride down lay your pride on the altars where you're not you're not trying to keep somebody from from preaching something that will help your family lay your pride down so that when you go when you go home from A good sermon that you're not saying well I don't know if he said it right or whatever lay aside all your Envy lay aside all your jealousy you've got to die to yourself and die to the way that you think it should be you don't want to be a Judas that kills the very thing that you say that you love lay aside all of your criticism lay aside everything so that you'll have nothing left but good ground that the word can be received and be born in lay aside every week that so easily besets us don't worry about what your neighbor's thinking about be concerned with what God thinks if you're concerned with what God thanks and everything will work itself out oh and we could just forget about what our neighbor thinks forget about what your neighbor thinks about how you praise God or how you raise your hand forget about what your neighbor thinks take what the son of man sowed and receive it into your heart if we could just die you know Jesus when he heard about Lazarus he waited for four days so he could be good and dead so that he could come forth and be a living testimony and sit there beside him at that feast and everybody would look at him and see that God's word was true but he had to wait till he was dead he waited till Lazarus was dead Elijah to that widow woman and she had to she had to die to her own ideas when Elijah said you first you're gonna make make some food for me if she wouldn't have done that would she have received her blessing but she died to her own thinking and and she she first fed Elijah the last little bit that she had because she was willing to die if we can be willing to till up the ground and break up that ground and Grub out all the greenbriars and all the stickers and all the thorns and all the roots of bitterness it'll bring down the holy spirit in our lives and we can get serious with God because why is the ground that matters the ground that matters the ground is the thing that matters you're actually growing up from the Earth you were predestinated to fulfill his word so keep your Vineyard eat the right food like brother Aaron was preaching on the other night and look at the right thing he's entertaining the right things because it matters what you allow to take root in your life be planted in Christ and you'll grow up like a tree the Bible says in Psalm chapter 1 he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away what kind of chaff can we see examples of in the Bible that Cain Cain that was just like his life was blown away to nothing because he was fine with being around the message but he didn't want to receive the word that Abel had Balaam that liked religion but he didn't want to receive he didn't want to recognize that the pillar of fire was in that camp of the Israelites a lot that liked being real close to the to the world but not enough he liked he liked the message he liked Abraham's message but not enough to leave the world Judas that he liked being happy and half out second Timothy says having a form of godliness but denying the power of the world and what is your power this afternoon the power is the word if you'll accept the seed of the word as so let it be sown into your heart you're that good ground like Abel that wanted the word and Moses and Abraham that were the word for their day and when the seed is planted what is ever ever a good Gardener do when the seed is planted what are you going to do you're going to water it yeah when that seed is planted the rain will fall okay and I'm closing here in just a few minutes Elijah that story of Elijah that we were telling earlier he destroyed the priest of the of of Baal and destroyed destroyed all the those priests about the Bale Baal what he was bail was this they believed that he was the fertility God and uh since we're a mixed audience I try to try to be a little bit vague with this but the rain would actually uh bail with the fertility God would cause the rain to fall on the Earth and the Earth would receive the rain in in an act we'll say it like that and the result of the ACT would be the fruit of the earth coming up all the all the the Harvest coming up and you see what they were what they were worshiping they were worshiping this fertility God that caused the skies to open up and Reign now see Elijah came forth and he tore he he killed all those all those Priests of Baal and and he first thing Elijah did and and in First Kings chapter 17 was he says rain's not going to come until I call for it not when Baal calls for it not when all these priests are bail that say they can do something but when I call for her and Elijah came through and he cleared all those he killed all the priests of Baal and he erected He restored that altar of the Living God just like the word is being the Elijah and this day was sent to restore the word that we believe and after he rebuilt the altar then he looked up and he saw a little cloud like a like the size of a man's Fist and it started getting bigger and he said there's a sound of abundance of rain and you see what happens when you receive the word of God in your heart the rain is going to fall and it's going to Quicken it brother said the preaching of the word brings his presence the working of Miracles brings his presence the preaching of the Gospel the word is what brings his presence now sometimes we say well I wonder if God's going to be with us tonight but if the word is here God is going to be here because there's a promise the promises that God God is always with his word the preaching of the Gospel unlocks the Holy Ghost to the Jews in Acts chapter 2. and on the preaching of the Gospel is what did that when Peter came out and he began to preach the preaching of the Gospel is what unlocked the Holy Ghost to the Samaritans in Acts chapter 8 and this would unlock the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles in Acts chapter 10. and it will do the same today whosoever will let him come if the word will sink into your heart the rain will water him there's a promise laying there in the Bible of Joel chapter 2 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the
