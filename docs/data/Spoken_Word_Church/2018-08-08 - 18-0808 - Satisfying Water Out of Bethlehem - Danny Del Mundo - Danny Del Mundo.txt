every time there's opportunity he gives me the privilege to stand behind the podium and you know it's not that easy you know because the bottom said the pastors are the most suspicious people amen and so we have great respect for him and we also appreciate what you're doing the support you're doing for the mission works and we're always praying for you and of course my precious brother my friend but there by the way amen we're looking forward for his next visit to the Philippines amen along with sister Jude Lord willing amen so go straight to the reading of the word and probably in between we also would like to share you some of the things that are going on in the mission field amen so let's read in 2nd samuel chapter 23 14 to 17 I believe this is very much familiar with each and every one where the word is always familiar with the bride for the bride amen and we had nothing to preach except the word of the hour Amen so turn your Bibles with me on 2nd Samuel chapter 23 we read from verse 14 it says and David longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three mighty men break through the host of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink there off but poured it out and to the Lord and he said be it far from me O Lord that I should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men let's pray dear Heavenly Father we thank you we give you all the glory and the honor and Lord you just speak once again through these lips of your little servant and made this be a little encouragement Lord for each and every one and thank you for your blood that continuously giving us wide access for your revealed word amen we thank you in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise the lord god bless you you may be seated amen so before I proceed on to the the preaching of the word we just want to acquaint you once again with the things that the Lord is doing of course in the Philippines the work of the Lord is still widely doing good by God's grace and with that more than 7,100 Islands Amen is in itself a mission field and also outside the Philippines we're doing a lot of mission works and before I been active in the Muslim country of Indonesia but things are now doing good and the ministers there are doing their own portion in in missions and that's that's our main purpose you know Bella Branham said get the natives save and let the native preach to some people and so Indonesia is for the Indonesian but we just want to try to do a little encouragement to the ministry and when I was there starting in 2003 and the first time I was there and then we did some exposition in starting in 2004 and just recently last February I was there and they requested that we got there all the local ministers in Indonesia and I was really I was really surprised because more than 30 ministers have been gathered in that three days of meetings along with some other local assembly fellowships and so before I was going to Indonesia at least two or three times a year but now I do it once a year because Myanmar has opened widely and in my previous trip there I was able to baptize another pastor and a portion of his congregation and if you remember when I was here two or three years ago there's a bishop in the denomination who who 30 churches under his ministry I brought my wife there and she was able to to see there's a Bible School in the church compound and he showed me the map where there are 30 stars and he said these stars represent the 30 churches that the Lord has given me for my 20 years of ministry and last November last year we gathered all this ministry ministers three from each church one pastor the assistant pastor and at least one worker plus the local ministers and we were able to gather by God's grace more than a hundred ministers under him of course 30 churches and they are they are in in deep desire to know more about this message and that's Bishop his name is pastor Tom boy he said anytime you come over here but the Danny my my my pulpit my church is open to you and in fact at that time I was about to baptize six individuals but we have no place and we just we just discuss about baptism and he said if you have no place to to baptize my baptismal pool here is open and you can you can use my baptismal pool and my wife was there and I was surprised when I asked him because I have already shared with them about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because we all we already had two meetings there and I was able to present the message of restoration you know and when you touch on the message of restoration of course initially the initial move of the restoration you touched on the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they have heard it already the students had heard it and I asked him well pastor you know I have you have heard what I what I taught about baptism i baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so if and he said if you baptize I will let my students go down and they will they will they will assist you in baptism so your students will hear that the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said I have no problem with that if it is it if it is scriptural then I will just accept it so last time I was there he said please pray for me because the organization is already pressuring me and because you know I have accepted a minister from the Philippines that does not belong to our community you know and he was being questioned but he said if they couldn't continue on questioning me then that's the reason for me to go out of the organization so just please pray for that brother he ceases he's kinda old and we were looking for but there are actually three pastors under him who are directly communicating with me and directly inviting me to minister to their congregation but I'm still praying for that because I I'm thinking if I go directly to his outreaches it will not do good to him and you know he would think that we are proselyting his guru no so so I said you just wait and let's see what what the bishop will will do in the next meetings so I have not yet presented the prophet but I have already shared the five comings of Elijah and of course it's still Elijah there the fourth one so so by God's grace we were able to share them the urgency and the necessity of having the prophet in the last day so we're praying that next time if we if I got there and I'm praying to be there in October so we will see even because we have already discussed the first four seals and the peep and the six so when you I said it's not yet because it's seven seals you know in the seventh seal there's half-hour silence and so that will be next so you cannot share the 17 without sharing the seven star seven star messenger so so we just follow the leading of the Lord and then the the recent development also in Japan right now we are doing good by God's grace and we have put together our efforts last last January of this year brother Craig birth Timothy prove it and also George winters in in the church we agreed when I was here last year we agreed to to gather all the Japanese believers in one place and they're actually working in Gifu where there's pew believers there and it's too far so we agreed to hold it in Tokyo area where I where I operate for the past few years and as I was telling with brother Samuel there's a couple who used to be missionaries in the organization and now they have embraced the message they have accepted the Prophet and he said he is really the Prophet and now they are very instrumental in bringing in more Japanese people actually the previous Japanese believers I found out that most of them are Chinese that moved into Japan but when my wife and I were there visiting a widow and a daughter which we were staying in their home so I have to bring sister Isabella with me and at that time the Lord gave me two souls a mother and his son and then this son married that young young the daughter of that Widow and they got married and they and still now they are holding on to this message so and they're pure Japanese so now we are praying that we are going to to find a place to gather them because every time we hold meetings we just rent function holes so by God Lord willing we will be able to make it there once again and as we commit ourselves you know because but the Vanna made mention about Japan and he was not able to do to get there amen so we just keep everything in the into the hand of the Lord and we just committed and we believe that the Lord amen what he is supposed to do ayman so spray for us and so we just want to talk about the simple thought this evening about the satisfying water out of Bethlehem amen so now in this scripture that we have read we see that David verse 15 said David longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate so it was just a longing it was just a wish because David realized that Bethlehem at that time was not under his control it was under the control of the Philistines and they say it says in verse 14 that David was then hold and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem so they had they had full control and so in reality David could just wish even and he was not expecting to actually drink out of that water because the reality is its although it's not it's not impossible because the three mighty men were able to cut through and they were able to get water and in fact they were able to bring it to David amen and David in fact did not did not bring it because he said I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to to drink this kind of water but not just literally the water but the act of these three mighty men putting themselves putting their lives at risk is something a sacrifice amen that that David could not could not take aim and I don't deserve such kind of service amen and and so we could understand why brother Branham said you know that was that was Christ in David amen because there's something you know so in in in some messages but random describe Bethlehem we know that Bethlehem means it's it's the house of God spread right it's the house of God spread but also in the same message in paragraph 119 brother Branham said but Bethlehem is the water seat of the province - so it's not just a place of the house of God's bread but literally it is also a place for a special water but Bethlehem is the water seat of the province - there was no water like Bethlehem had David used to think when I take my ship and start out of mourning and go by that old well and drink oh how cool and how sweet and how it quenches the thirst amen and now his trots going yet anointed oh if only I had a drink of water and he screamed out in his despair or if someone would bring me a drink again from that old well yonder at Bethlehem after dreaming up all his childhood days and the victories and see him in the place where his setting her between the friars his scream oh if someone could bring me water from Bethlehem so it was a deep longing and you know sometimes it happens to us you know we're longing for something but we know it won't be possible it won't be it won't be available amen and we could we could only wish we could only think and that was the situation up David amen and Berman said you know David was dreaming of all his childhood days and perhaps you know that well has a lot of thing for David to remember you know and maybe he was when he wrote that song as the deer hunted for water you know he he might have taken the inspiration in that in that well you know maybe while while pastoring his his sheep you know here comes the blood the bleeding deer and you know but one said when when the deer is wounded when he went when the deer is fighting for its life the only thing that he could he could do is to run and he will he will not stop running until he find water amen and so that's is that some kind of an inspiration well David was able to write that song as the deer panteth poured water in it and so without the knowledge of David without the knowledge of David we come to realize that these three mighty warriors they said three of his mighty warriors pulled their swords sleep upon the cam and cut their way 25 miles David in there going no doubt wondered where they are what they have done where did they go - did they know their job had ice in their lives they right in the jaws of death through a 25 mile line laying in ambush everywhere and the swords a flickering and the shields of blasting but their men their brother that they believed that would be king decide a drink amen and so they did this for the King you know and these three mighty men no question about their bravery about their courage about you know their their men of valor and you know these are some kind of special force special team you know in the Philippines we have the SAP special Action Force of course we have the the sills sill Navy SEALs here you know they're special team and they are very they have so much in them you know and probably these three mighty men they're they have different kinds of specialties maybe one of them is a it's a sniper one is good in close combat you know and so the sniper will be just staying in in a higher place when the two come in and cut through and he just you know even and probably the other one he he has the the container of water is the water boy yeah so he's the water boy but he's still part of the team amen so it's the same thing when we go to mission works amen we are everybody is different but we're part of the team you know we cannot be the same in everything amen but all our talents are being used by God and God is a God of variety amen but the most important thing is to be able to accomplish what is supposed to be accomplished amen and it doesn't also matter where the credit goes a man because what we do just like these three mighty men amen this is not for their own glory but this is something to serve their king amen so it's the same thing that we're doing here here were there amen and everyone is doing his part we accomplished the same thing we also being converted and because we're working as a team Amen it is credited to us and it gives glory to the Lord amen so so that's why he said now o you Bethlehem dwellers in the same message hallelujah I call for men warriors who was not afraid I don't care if there's eight hundred standing on one side and ten thousand on the other I want warriors who will come with me and cut a hole through this line of unbelieving Philistines the world council has got garrison around the Word of God trying to make it Creed's and feed the people there's a well there's a fountain open in the house of David Bethlehem for sin and uncleanliness brothers sin is unbelief in his world amen so now with the denominations have put up you know high walls and fences just to take control amen but we believe we will not stop even speak about the endtime evangelism and we will not stop evangelizing we will not stop doing mission works I mean as long as there is opportunity because the reason why we are still here is that there still souls gender that need to hear this message of the hour to bring them into the fold amen and we need to work together for this purpose amen so just so I said I want warriors who will come with me amen and before we we came to to the States I invited one of the new converts in the message his is probably five to six hours south of Manila and this this pastor his name is rod Alvarez he also belongs to a a prominent organization but we were able to hold the mr. Expo in their group and then he was the first one to step up and he decided to be baptized also along with some of his congregation and he said now bastard I need I need prayers because now the the churches where I am you know where I still belong to them I still join with the fellowship but it looks like little by little you know I feel being there's some some kind of bit because they know that I was already baptized and he said our organization will is going to have a mass baptism and they had the meeting and and he said to what baptism you're going to to to baptize you know and they said they will still baptized in the name of the Father Son and the Holy Spirit and and he said so if that's the way you're going to baptize after all this thing because he already shared you know all these things and he or he he has already read the church age book and he cleared also that brother branham is the prophet and now he said his wife was testifying when when they were in her place prior to his preaching and and his his wife said you know every time we had they have a ministers meeting in the organization and every time he stands and he share his thoughts about the words that that but the scriptures that they're talking about and he is although he is not coating brother branham but he is coating what is what what the prophet has said about those scriptures and everybody's being astonished everybody is you know appreciate what he's saying amen and there are only some ministers that are inviting him to preach for their churches so that's why we really believe that there is really that this message is really the truth amen but even then they feel some some kind of pressure and so last time he said you know we need we need prayers because now I really feel some kind of pressure and he said should I should I leave the organization now and I said don't leave yes stay with them and you know Barry's opportunity you know he just shared them what what so you just keep on studying about this message and so until they're the ones to kick you out you know that's the time you have to leave and last time they actually was their church Thanksgiving and it was the first church Thanksgiving that he invited a minister he was inviting me but we have already flown here but I endorsed my assistant pastor in the church and and he spoke last Sunday so it was the first time that he invited a minister not with from within the organization so he is really standing up and he's really declaring what he is now standing for so we we pray for him because this brother is also influential is also active in pioneering works and he is also establishing many churches so through him we believe that we can expand you know we can still reach more people amen so in continuation he said now like brother Branham said that was that was Christ in David and brother branham he spoke here in God's always find their places he said in product in paragraph 32 he said David said far be that I drink it and he poured it upon the ground as a drink offering to the Lord what a beautiful type of the same thing of this John 3:16 tonight naman God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and then in 33 and what did Christ do the light that he had to live eternally he poured it upon the ground from his veins his natural life upon the ground as a sin offering for us and how the Gentiles they men of honor men great men taking the sword and standing there and cutting their way through to get a fresh drink of water for Christ our David which is very unpopular today so that was a a prophetic act of David when he poured down that water that speaks of Christ Villa Branham said you know and David longed for that water and yet when that water was in front of him of court he accepted it but he didn't drink it not because Birmingham it was not mean Amen but he was portraying a future event amen so that when he when he poured that water into the ground he deprived himself of something he was longing because he realized the sacrifice of these three warriors amen he David in that in so much humility he poured that water I don't deserve this amen only the Lord this this kind of service Amon and so he deprived himself and this spoke bellman so this speaks of Jesus Christ himself because he had eternal he had that life in him amen he was God made flesh here on earth even the blood that was in him but when I'm said was not the blood of a Jew it neither it was a blood of the Gentile it was God's blood amen because that blood was to be poured down into the into Calvary amen for our Redemption amen and what did he do he said he deprived himself a man he was in glory his you know he is the Almighty a man but he went down a man depriving himself of all the glorious thing he had to to obtain but you know he'd applied himself he poured his blood amen and that was the blood you know that he said that he had to live eternally yet he poured it upon the ground from his veins that is natural and like a natural life to the ground as a sin offering for us hallelujah so as they be deprived himself it was the future manifestation of what the Lord did 2,000 years ago and now you see in the scriptures there are many things many many occasions or events in the Bible where the bride is always connected with the well amen we remember we remember Eleazer when when Abraham designated Elisha to find the bride for Isaac and Alisa didn't know who that woman is but he knew what kind of a woman his Lord Abraham was desiring for his son Isaac because the servant always knows the desire of his Lord amen and so when when after crossing the the the vast desert you know in so ELISA asked for a sign and he sign and the sign we know that the sign that he asked was whoever will give him drink and not only him but the best with him amen and and so where was he he was in front of the well and so a we saw that in the in Genesis I believe that's in Genesis chapter 24 were you know there of course there were many other women it was not only Rebecca who was there and probably other women offered water to to Elissa to drink and he was waiting for some more drinks were poor the the camels with him you know but no one so they may be beautiful they may be appealing amen but that's not the sign he was looking for amen until there's a woman amen and we know that that's Rebecca and without even asking and after giving him water you know and Rebecca look at those camels and he went up and down you know quite a number of times going back and forth amen and until those those beasts were satisfied amen it was not just few you know going down those stairs because the well at that time were not we're not just the well that we have right now you know they they understand they they dig big holes and then they put stairs on the side that you can go down and carry this this vessel of water so it was not easy but that's the kind of service so what represents Rebecca was the kind of service and that was the one Elisha was looking because the bride the wife amen amen is designed to serve hallelujah just like those warriors they were designed to serve of course they had they were designed to fight but that is in service for the king and his kingdom so Rebecca amen and and so there was no second thought well ELISA that this is the bride for his Lord I saw a man and the good thing there we know that one of the beasts one of the camels that that Rebecca gave water to a man was the same beast that brought her to his to her husband Isaac amen so the same thing in the New Testament there was a woman and he was also in beside the well a man does in John chapter 4 and in John chapter 4 you see it's the same sign he said can you give me drink just like King David oh how I long I could drink what a lot of Bethlehem but Jesus asked the woman he said can you give me drink and the woman was so surprised how come you're here you're dealing with me I'm a Samaritan and you're a Jew amen so the first encounter she understood he was just a mere Jew amen but in the process of their conversation Jesus said well whoever drinks water up did out of this well he will be thirsty again amen but he said out of the water that I'm going to give a man out of him shall flow rivers shall flow rivers of water amen so this is a different kind of water and the woman became thirsty you know that's the good sign of the bride when when she hears the word she feels thirsty she wants more amen and she will be she will she loves for it hallelujah and this is and this design that that woman although in her condition you know we know the situation but she had five men in and she had still no husband a male and she had six already and the man Jesus was the seventh man he said I perceived that you are a prophet because this is the first time they met and and and he knew already what kind of situation he was she was a man and so then the woman later on she realized that he was not only a prophet but he was the Messiah amen and so what happened to the woman he became also the well amen so she ran to the city and you know when when just like in the book of Revelation whoever thirsts come amen and whoever will you know will come and if you are able to to drink a mint then you will now be willing to give out water also amen and and so in the process of their conversation so the woman realized he was the Messiah amen and now this woman got converted something happened to her and now it changed her life he mainly changed her life amen now another scripture in John in let's see in Genesis chapter 26 if you can follow with me let's read in Genesis chapter 26 alright here's in verse verse 12 he said this is I said I then Isaac sowed in the land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the Lord blessed him and the man works great and went forward and grew until he became very great for he had possession of flux and possession of herds and great store observance and the Philistines envied him and 15 for all the whales which his father servants had did in the days of Abraham his father the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth ayman so during the time of Abraham he was able to dig wells and this means that Abraham dig provided sweet water they had spring in them but you know this Jill jealous Philistines you know this is this is what happened when I went when people became become jealous jealousy is is such a treacherous attitude you know and and people who are who have this kind of attitude you know if they don't have it they don't want others also to help it amen and so what they did with the the AP with the wealth of Abraham they filled it with with dirt they covered amen but one day in verse 17 Isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of juror and he said Isaac dig again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them amen so it's the same thing with the message that we have right now it's it's not something new but when I'm said it's always there only it is covered amen only it is veiled because there are Philistines and these are the the dominica light and spirit Balaam is even Jezebel spirit in the church amen amen and because of the Cleaves and dogmas the the eyes of the people were being covered and with that as here the whales are being covered also amen but praise God in the last days and this is what have happened today this is not something new in it but our eyes are just open and there is something in us which is the seed of God amen that is able to respond and we realize Amen that there is something into it now aye sir a man realize it's the same piece of land it's the same piece of property that his father Abraham a man had in his day and he knew he knew that the words are just in there being covered and the only thing that David had to do was to dig it again because the spring underneath will not will not disappear it's always there it's always there only it is covered ayman and so he said the nice up serpents dig in the valley and from there a well of springing water and the herd men of gara did stripe with Isaac's headman saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well asset because they strobe with him amen and you know as it means contention in verse 21 and they did another well and strop or duck also and he called the name of it Sydnor which means strife and then in verse 22 and he removed from thence and big another whale and you know God is perfect in 3 amen and he removed from thence and digged another world and for that destroyed not and he called the name of betray Habad and he said for now the Lord had made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land Amen now it's the same thing there are many people you know the people who did in this message but the only thing that they can find is contention right Amen they find scriptures they plant coat asian amen and the only thing they do is to find somebody to argue with hallelujah amen and then the second the second group is that they did and they could and I so called it Sydnor because it's try even now the same thing also there are many churches today they could not fellowship because they could not they could not agree at some point with something Amen but there are people who are able to dig deeper amen who are able to dig further Amen that they say you know now he said under that went deeper and Hiromu Pontins and dig another well and for that destroyed now amen we did this message not to argue with anyone we did this message not to to abstract the vision Amen but in the tournament with the planter and then any coal that that will remove all and he said for now the Lord had not room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land Amen so there are people amen who who studied this message take this message that to argue not to have division whatsoever but to find a place to be proposed hallelujah amen and I believe I'm looking for a bunch of people who have digged this well a big dis message amen and become fruitful hallelujah amen so now the message speak to the rock let me coated he said it says a great spring or well there and I like what brother Branham said many little wells a perfect type of the church the church he said is the judgment seat where heaven is the great judgment seat of God and the little words represent the little churches all out and judgment begins at the house of God amen and this is what I see amen when Isaac did these whales again amen we have a deacon in the church and his job is to to dig wells and to make artesian well and we have no we have no modern gadgets they have no modern gadgets there but I don't know what they have but you know they just cut a branch a little branch of a certain tree and and then he holds it and I don't know sometimes it move down and when it moves down that points that in that place there is spring underneath and so when when they and they will start to to to put hole and put the pipe you know and then little by little you know when when they did when they got through amen underneath then suddenly there's water in it amen now there are many peoples in the world amen we belong to some other organization I was born a Catholic raised a Catholic even taught in a Catholic school for a year amen you see but I found out just like what butter burns and there are little churches they're little individuals and they are wells it's an every one of us that are here are wells we are well designed to produce to provide water to provide sweet water amen but because of our natural birth amen something happened and the things that we have learned before this world for a long time were not working because the spiritual Philistines put that into it by our natural birth this world could not produce the sweet water it just provides the water because jazz like that water it was Jacob's Well that's what Jesus said whoever drinks out of this water he will be thirsty again and notice that it was even named after Jacob it was named after Israel amen so Jacob is unconverted so whoever drinks of that well will be thirsty again there is no conversion and but God amen the Lord Jesus has provided that water amen and you know the what do they do what what have happened to us because of this message because of this world amen and you know it you know if there is there is an old artesian well you know I you might have that here before amen in the Philippines we have some acid that in in in especially in the provinces but if for a long time you don't use it the water will the water level will go down and it will be hard for you to pump it you know but there is one thing that when we were young what we do we get picture a picture of water a pail and then we pour water down and then we pump and then we listen so we pour water again and then we pump it and then we listen and then we hear something and then little by little there is some some kind of a pressure a power that's holding it and then little by little the water is coming out you know the water is coming out and the first water that will come out you know it's dark it's dirty it's rusty later on it's sandy you know and then and then it becomes clearer and clearer and you know it becomes clearer and clearer as you pump it amen so it's the same thing the first time we heard this message amen it looks like Jesus said the water that I did that I give amen out of the end shall flow rivers of water because you need to drink from it first so that this water once it touched the water down low amen it will serve as Amanda that it will pump it up in and it will produce and you know the pressing when we received this message what comes out of our mouths what comes out you know we we start to repair we start to confess our sins amen because those are the rest those are the decks being down there for a long time amen so but when you drink of this water when we have this message of justification amen we start to realize amen that we are sons and daughters of God and the moment we confess our sins and then things are coming out but little by little lemon out of justification sanctification comes in and then and then the baptism of the holy spirit it becomes clearer and clearer and clearer and now you're not just drinking but you're giving drink also because I love you shalt know amen what you drink this water loop of the message of the hour am a little by little with all these things of the negative things all this bitterness all this they were the things that the spirit the Spirit of Palestine had had aborted amen once this come out hallelujah amen out of you shall flow rivers not just drop but rivers of living water amen hallelujah now in the message broken sister he said in John chapter 7 37 to 38 he said Jesus said in the last days of the Feast of the tabernacle What did he say if any man thirst let him come to me and drink right in a bunch of theologians if any man thirst let him come to me and drink or the scripture has said adobe's innermost being shall flow rivers of living water there's the living fountain the fountain that the people has forsaken today for the Creed they are per se caen the fountain of living water let me introduce you to him and I'm closing he said he to me is that fronting that say beggars like and the child when they were dying in the wilderness I believe is the rock in a certainty to his that rock in a weary land he is the shelter in the time of storm Zakaria 13 he is the fountain that's open in the house of David for sin I believe him to be that and then in some 36 verse 9 he is David's Fountain of Life he is the still waters of David and the green pastures he's the water by the Brookside for David in Genesis 17 he's Abraham's nursing blessed el-shaddai but when his life was gone from him a man a man of a hundred years old how will this thing be I am bought my wife is old how can these things be he said I am el shaddai now L is the the garden and the Shahada is breast and shad is plural which means I am the breasted God like a baby that splatting and it seek and it strength is gone from it lean upon the mother's bosom and nurse it strength back sure when it's nursing it isn't fretting no more at the mother's breast it's satisfied while it's getting its strength amen now that s the well of living water now in press Corinthians chapter 10 in verse 20 said moreover brethren I would not that you should be ignorant Paul said how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ amen is a d'autre that follows the people of Israel Paul said that was Christ it followed them wherever they go it followed them whenever they need water to drink their the thirsty it satisfied their thirst wherever they go and he said that rock was Christ meaning anytime they need him anytime they need water to drink it provides water for them amen you know and at this point we just want to to change the thought because in Matthew chapter 27 in verse 33 it says and when they were come unto a place called Golgotha that is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink amen and what a situation you know imagine you're very thirsty and you're looking for water to satisfy your thirst and somebody gives you vinegar yeah or something bitter yeah amen it doesn't it's not good amen it's worse but this happened to the Lord 2,000 years ago and that was the thing you know he the Lord was being placed in such a situation he was dying physically the life was you know was about to leave that body of flesh and at the brink of there you feel thirsty because brother Burnham said thirst is a sign of death that's why God he said place some some kind of a thirst in a man so that he knows his dying you know when when you feel thirst that means you're dying you need to satisfy that thirst to keep yourself alive right and so Jesus was asking for water so that reminds us of David David was not dying but he wanted to drink what up early who do work probably of meetings planning now he got thirsty and he said oh I love how I love how I wish I could drink out of that water from that layer there's many water available in his palace but he was thirsting for that water in Bali because he knew how sweet it was it's not after for any kind of water it's always available water is always available for David but there's a time that he was really longing for that water now in this same manner 2,000 years ago that rock was Christ amen whatever they do remember Moses he heard the truck once because he was just you know helped to speak to that rock and the water will just break out it doesn't he didn't have to to hit that rock now just be but because of the head the congregation his temper came in and he hit that rock and that rock was Christ amen but the thing is although Moses did not speak but instead he heard that rock although that rock was offended but still give water many times in our lives we disappoint him as a as a as a man I disappoint God once in a while even Paul said I die daily I passed like daily many Paul realized how he was consistently offending God but God is not rough but although beyond despite of all these hurt things every time any time we need we seek God but I need healing Lord I'm in the midst of struggles I need your help good thirsting for something but God set aside the offense that we do against him and then he provides satisfying water to provide for our thirst amen but at this point in time it's a different story because now he is the one that is needing water is the one that is asking give me water David I love to drink that water out of Bethlehem now this son of David speaking 2,000 years ago I need water I love to drink that water and he's seeking for that water out of Bethlehem amen and so but instead they gave him vinegar mingled with God and what a mingled with God it was better it was terribly sour amen now 2,000 years after loud the CNH came amen his thirsty yeah he's looking for water and it's looking for Bethlehem hallelujah a nice nap this not just a literal bedlam is looking for now because Barbara said these little Bethlehem's these little wells are the churches the little churches the little that the individuals the believers because in us is a well of living water we just have to realize we are dug Bethlehem today hallelujah and so he is bursting for this water and he wants this water to come Tobias Bethlehem and Reese's Bethlehem today not the denomination is not looking for water coming out of Baptists trails not from any Pentecostal Wells not from the Catholic Wells their wells are good their words are very appealing attractive to the eyes of all the people amen but these are broken sisters but we have the bridegroom today looking for that word he is thirsty and there must be a Bethlehem today to Sweetwater amen we just come out this little badly not Baptist we're not against the people in those wells amen but we we know what we're saying but the bride today is that living well and he identified that bride he wants to drink the Lord is thirsting and that's why he said in the loudest in the same church he doesn't want a lukewarm water that lukewarm water coming out of this various well I mean it doesn't taste good it doesn't even smell good no sweet sour amen in another smelling item for the Lord it's not after that no matter how good their cups are amen but today it's the bride which is the Bethlehem of the Lord Jesus Christ and he is looking for that water but only his Bethlehem only the bride today can produce and how can we do that just like that illustration that old well amen you need to pour in something into it so that it can reach spring deep down amen and so that sweet water out of Bethlehem needs a pouring from the message of the app so that's why we need to drink and drink hallelujah and when we started to drink amen and when it reach down there to the spring which is our heart where our soul is a mint suddenly something squeaking there something strike there and it opens up amen and little by little all this things all this stuff came out amen and he said brother Brennan again let me let me coat this he just illustrated at one time when he was he was a great game warden let me just read it I remember when I used to was the State game warden of Indian I used to go by in Harrison County a certain well a spring I was it was always bubbling up and just so it looked like it was the most happiest thing whether the snow was on the ground ice was froze how cold it was it's still bubble where the old man made pants and tongues with frogs and everything was out there froze over solid and that goes to show that any denomination threw a little lack of spirit or a little change of atmosphere will freeze over but God's artesian well he's the same yesterday today and forever it keeps all the things bubbled out of it and shoved out of it and there is none in there to begin with the minute it gets into it it will push it out of the way that thing was bubbling up like that and I said sat down there one day I thought I believe I'll talk to that spring just for a moment I took off my hat and I said what are you so happy about what are you babbling so about maybe it's because the dish drink from you once in a while if he could have spa can hit up said no I said maybe it's because that I drink from you now that isn't there I said well what's making you so pure so clean what is it bubbling that makes you bubble full of joy all the time and nothing can freeze you over you're spurting up in the air and there is nothing clean water if it could have spoken to me you know what that well would have said he'd have said brother branham it isn't me bubbling it's something behind me bubbling me and that's the way it is that's a poor word but you know what it about I mean and that's the way it's with a born-again experience you cannot contain it it's a well of water within you bubbling up into everlasting life see there is something about it that you have nothing to do with the magnet hands may freeze and then begging for revival and everything but a man that's under that fountain living in that fountain it's day and night no you don't have to wait on local drains and local rebels you're full of it I'll give it unto him a fountain of life in him bubbling under something in a best fresh every day pure and clean it's the unadulterated Word of God in your heart and not vindicating itself speaking for itself I don't care whether it's raining whether it's snowing what kind of weather this you are still happy because the Holy Spirit is in there bubbling up it's the hidden power amen oh it's secret it's within a theme and that's why believers that we believers should be the most happiest people living here on earth and sometimes people get sick but you know what makes them see is just that they're just so sad amen you know sadness brings loneliness and then later on it becomes it gives you more sickness in it now it gives up itself freely to whomsoever will drink and use its substance now you don't have to pick out saying well now I just have to go to the Methodist Church because I'm a method for a revival I'll have to go over here but I have to go a Pentecostal because I'm a Pentecostal revivalist I'm telling you when you got that well of water springing up that fountain when you're drinking by there there is no difference you give to anything that comes by you're willing to give hope of life to a Catholic to a Protestant to a Jew to an atheist or whatever it is you really really got something in you that's doing it hallelujah so we're here where we become the fountain because the fount we receive here he's the fountain of living water but very spring inside us amen the whoever comes to us whoever Easterns when they approach us they become satisfied people approach you they're discouraged but they leave you the tender but they become encouraged because they were able to drink from you amen he is the main source amen but we are also found we are also Springs of water that we can give waters to do those who are in need hallelujah Amen and so that's why in Revelation chapter 22 verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely Amen hallelujah so the same thing as you've made mentioned that woman at the well she ran to the city and brought in more people that were able to drink amen there was a man there were men Paul and Silas they were able to drink out of this fountain of life amen Paul used to drink from that water from the denomination from the seminary he was in amen but that water he drank a mint made him to persecute the believers and even persecuted Jesus because he was drinking from another source I mean but the moment he met that source and at the moment he started to drink out of the fountain of life his life changed even the people he was surrounded with with with with other group of people this this that the same people he was persecuting now he became one with them and all of them were drinking from the same counting and because they were drinking from the same fountain it produced the same kind of life in them hallelujah steepened because he was able to drink from that source hallelujah Jesus the source when he was right there at the cross of Calvary he said Father forgive them for they know not what they do amen and Stephen was able to drink from that source he must've found it but that steepened drank from and sleeper said when he was persecuted what sleep and said Amen Lord don't discount against them it produced the same light it produced the same reaction upon any any action hallelujah why because he was able to drink from that source amen and so the same thing Paul and Silas amen the Paul was able to drink from that fountain from that source and now it changed his ways it changed the world coming out from his mouth hallelujah he was one with the people because they were drinking from the same source now I will happily between drinking from the same source we will be preaching the same thing hallelujah and so now we will be producing the same kind of life Paul and Silas they were caught amen they did that react they were beaten almost to death and then later on they were imprisoned but they were so they they had so much in them they become also the spring the source in the rivers of water were flowing from them that at the middle of the night amen when they when they they woke up that spring kept bubbling it kept on pumping them and they could not contain themselves behind em beyond those paints those rooms that they had the bruises it didn't stop them because there's something in them that kept bubbling hallelujah come on Paul let's worship the Lord come on Silas I was waiting for you so why because there is something in them even in any kind of circumstances any in any kind of situation if there is a spring in us it will keep pumping and bubbling hallelujah amen and the bubble will come out and we cannot get rid of it hallelujah and so they they worship they praise they pray amen and what happened there's a thirsty vessel there this is thirsty vessel there a mate what shall I do amen and from him there are other thirsty vessels turn another well even the guard of the jail who who almost committed suicide amen they were there but because he heard and because he witnessed the way Paul and Silas Lee after amen it was wide open but they remained there they stayed there because there is a vessel there is a spring that needs to be watered amen and then later on you know what happened it didn't stop there amen you in your house even his family amen later on was father they were also vessels they were also wells and they only needed a man part of that water from the source amen so it's the same thing just like you know another thing in the book of Revelation we know he said that there is a voice of many waters you know the Bible said in Revelation speak there is the voice of many waters and Birmingham said also he pointed to another scripture he said it the voice of many waters is the multigon amen and this was being lent this verse was being lined up amen in Revelation chapter 19 rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready so you know when you at times which they do this you know and when you are when people wants to have some kind of rest you know they did the you know when you're beside the still waters you know this was vertical this the the sound that this water the flow of the river you know it gives some kind of resting condition amen and so sometimes people they make this artificial sound also like a flowing river it does good to amen and we put that thing and you know just like a man you know resting and and he is hearing this kind of sound like a flowing river it's like in the book of the book of Revelation it is the voice of many waters it's the great multitude and with this voice of many waters the bride amen so the Lord is just resting and this bubbling sound from our hearts even just like the the water coming out of the bride today amen is good to hear by the bridegroom himself it's the voice of many waters because the the the channel's the channels are being open and so these waters are just coming out freely and it's a good thing to hear by the breakroom our worship our prayers are like flowing rivers voice of many waters amen in Revelation chapter 4 rotation he said alright here was voices oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of live voices he said this was Jeffersonville but I believe he's saying this to the bride did the whole world thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity and defiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that standard against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just a sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that rose him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil hallelujah in sweetness and holiness and purity and defiled lives you know today there's so much hatred you read newspaper so much hatred you know bla against why sometimes black against black or white against watching so much bitterness the world is full a bit full of negativism amen he cannot drink from it but the bride will always produce sweetness it's always sweetness rice the mystery of God revealed if the brother you think is a little wrong or the sisters say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness Springer because it will affect him and it will take the cry out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the tabernacle here it will kill the Spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it will do everything don't you do that hallelujah so God is he's desiring his thirsting he's longing he wish like David how I longed I could drink out of the water of Bethlehem and may we be little Bethlehem's provide sweet water remember what we do amen what we ever we say whatever we think amen these are waters amen and with us last scripture that we read this in Matthew chapter 26 this another woman here in verse 7 there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this race for this island might have been solved for much and given to the poor when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me now this is service for ye have the poor always with you but me have not always for in that she had poured disappointment on my body she did it for my birria verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman had done be told for a memorial of her now remember number one this woman although she was a sinner but she was able to discern the time that Jesus said she did it for my birria amen she did this kind of service for my birria but today there's another woman which is the bride of Jesus Christ which is doing a service not for his burial hidden it happened already 2000 years ago but we're doing a service today not to bury the Lord Napoli's Burien but this is poured the body change amen the service that we do is not for the burial but for the resurrection but the wrap for the coming rapture amen and so we represent we are being represented by this woman 2000 years ago amen now remember water was also involved also it would not because water is just a kind of service and that water that the Warriors gave to them it was just a form of service to the king amen now at this point the water was also represented not to be dread but a service because Simon invited Jesus but he was not welcome because if he was welcomed that he was able to give him water amen not to drink not just to drink but also to was his feet but no one gave him water to drink neither to wash his feet amen and so Jesus was longing for a service but this kind of woman a woman the moment she realized nobody gave water nobody wash the feet of Jesus and you know what the what words what was the next thing she ran to the to the store and bought and and got you know and I would like to believe that the money she had in her was not a good money amen but in this case it was God is always on top of every situation he knew that woman from the start he knew who she was he knew what kind of life she had he knew what kind of money she had in possession amen so this woman needs to be washed and only forgiveness can wash her amen and so that situation made the bad money in her was to be in exchange of something for service to the Lord and now she no longer had that money and what she had was an alabaster box with the precious ointment amen and he and she poured it upon his head because she recognized Jesus as her amen it's the same thing that we do we recognize our head today we give juice service to our head which is Jesus Christ amen and so down low and then little by little you know and and he knelt down and there was no water available amen but when when he when she knelt down and that precious ointment was flowing down just like a run you know from his head to the beard to the garment down to the foot amen and she could not even look up to see the face of the Lord but she was repenting she was confessing she was bowing amen and then suddenly Jesus called Simon what can you say what do you think who will rejoice more the one who was more there or the one who was little and for both of them are okay who will rejoice more and Simon knew what Jesus was telling about and also that woman fell it was rebuilt or what Jesus was saying that means it was a signal that her sins were forgiven and faith cometh by hearing and then that thing fell into his heart and as if he was the woman for a long time was able to drink because all her life she heard was accusation you're a bad woman you're an adulteress sure you're a dirty woman you don't deserve to live everything that she heard but for the first time she heard something from her head imminent that fell into his heart and it looks like a water to that dried artesian well and it dropped into the channel suddenly I could imagine just like that artesian and there was a deep what you call the groaning even there was a deep cry and a cry from Medan are to be repented heart Hindman and suddenly all the channels even came open wide open and those channels little by little hallelujah from her eyes flow rivers of water even and it was not just a small amount of water that came out of her over eyes amen and those those tears did not come from somewhere it comes from her heart Heymann and she was able to ask the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ amen out of that Anissa and brother Branham said the only decent part of that woman was her long hair amen and of course he's repented heart amen and so now out of that came the water in wash the feet of the Lord Jesus and that was the Atmos service that the Lord was able to receive he was thirsty he came to the temple one thing wanting to drink no one wants to give him water because they want to give their own water just like the broken cisterns they rejected the fountain of living water and then they dig their own sister he was rejected same thing two thousand years ago two thousand years after that a man in this age many churches many denominations organization big organization rejected the message of the hour which is the source but you should be glad tonight ayman that you open your heart and this water flow truly down to your heart and all the channels came or wide open and it's giving service to the Lord is giving sweetness amen and it's one thing desiring that's the voice of many waters that is hearing our service amen in the Old Testament he is always following Israel giving water giving water he still does this is provides water today that we need whenever we need it he will provide it amen but on the other end we have to realize he's like David how long I could drink out of that water of Bethlehem may we be that Bethlehem tonight amen that out of our mouth October hearts comes comes out sweetness happiness rejoicing gratitude hallelujah and when we worship it satisfies our Lord it satisfies our King hallelujah praise the Lord can we worship Him tonight Amen thank you Lord Jesus amen as I invite you to stand up amen in prayer hallelujah before we sing song as a worship amen let's just bow our
