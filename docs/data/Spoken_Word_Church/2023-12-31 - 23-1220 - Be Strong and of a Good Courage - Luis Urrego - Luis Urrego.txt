go ahead and go to the word this morning uh this evening and uh you know I'm not good about preliminaries and things so let's just go ahead and go to the word and U and uh let's just bow our heads this evening our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity that we have to come together Lord uh this evening father it may be cold outside Lord but father God you're you're the one that gives us the warmth Lord and warmth father spiritual warmth Lord father God if our soul is right and and and eternal internally bound Lord God lord Jesus the outside elements don't matter father God because Lord we're safe under your wings father and so Lord Jesus we just ask that you would have your way with us this evening help us to receive something from your word father God that would give us courage Lord that would encourage us father to move forward Lord Jesus we're here father God uh embarking another year ahead of us if it Be Your Will Lord and father God we just ask father God that you would help us Lord to prepare ourselves Lord Jesus for father we don't know what's ahead but Lord you you do Lord and if we could just put confidence in you and put our trust in you father God then Lord everything else will take care of itself father God we love you and we ask father for forgiveness for our sins and cleanse us Lord from all of our iniquities and we pray Lord that you'd be with those that are sick this evening we remember brother Aaron Lord and pray that you would just touch his body Lord and strengthen him Lord God I certainly understand Lord how he's feeling and I just ask that you would just bless him Lord and strengthen his body Lord and and also Lord you just continue to be with brother Dell as well Lord God and continue to be with Nanny there Lord Jesus and we just ask that you would just have Special Touch for our brother Lord God we ask we commit our ourselves now into you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord Jesus let's go to Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 1 and uh very familiar scripture but I want to I want to and I did not give him these scriptures so I do apologize back there but that's why we should have our Bibles that's right always have your Bibles don't depend on that thing all the time it's like brother Chris Long says I want to hear Pages turn what happened to that sound because we two2 dependent on those screens sorry it starts with a rebuke [Laughter] already um so let's Joshua chapter 1 says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake Thee I want you to just put your name in that in that scripture right there I will not forsake sister June I will not forsake brother Wade I will not forsake Brother Don I will not forsake sister Susan I will not forsake brother George put yourself in that scripture amen cuz that wasn't just for Joshua it was for you personally amen do you believe that the all the word of God is for you amen it's not wasn't just for the Israelites or for or or some sort of historical thing that we just oh look at it's you know something history but it's something personal to you and then when you put yourself in that scripture amen it it it it brings new life to it you see because God is an everpresent God Amen he's a god of now not just the god of yesterday and not just a god of the future but he's a god of now amen and he wants he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble amen praise God and then I I want to finish here with this scripture and then you you can have your seats it says be strong and of good courage verse 6 For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to to give them amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening amen continuing here on verse seven only be thou strong and very courageous he tells him again only be thou strong and very courageous amen that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth amen but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for even Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success verse n have I not commanded thee so he he's he's telling them again and I think this is about the third time he said have I not commanded thee be strong and of good courage amen Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest amen so then that's the that's the key verse I wanted to finish off there with so have not I commanded thee be strong and of good couragement amen amen yeah I believe it's what God wants us to have amen amen and this this applies to not just only in Good Times amen but it applies in the bad times as well that's when courage really shines amen that's when it really pays to Have Courage amen and so if I want if I just wanted to give it a little title tonight is be strong and of good courage amen be strong and of good courage amen we want to welcome our visitors here tonight God bless you brother good to have you with us amen um and so we just appreciate uh appreciate what the Lord gives us amen through his word amen amen so we notice here that in in Joshua Joshua was already an older man when God told him to do this amen he he he we know that he he was with Moses walking with Moses and following Moses following his message amen and he came to a point amen that it was time for him to lead the children of Israel forward amen and and and so I'm sure that for Joshua it was a scary task but he had seen what God did through Moses amen and so as as as as God was with Moses Joshua knew that he had to be with with him as well if he was to take the children of Israel over to the promised land right because why God had already made the promise and so the promise was for them and God he knew that God was one that cannot lie right so if God made the promise to them many years ago then God was going to fulfill that promise and it was about that time it was it was that promise was about to be fulfilled and Joshua didn't have any any doubt whatsoever that God was able to fulfill his promise amen it's just like us Amen in this hour I believe that we're we're we're in the end time in this I I don't know how you feel about it I I I you know the world is is going insane amen amen and and and and and we are in it we we feel the the the the the the uh it's it's an anointing that's upon it's that's upon the hour that if you don't know that we are living in those times amen then you're not seeing things the way right you love this world too much amen we should be preparing to go out get out of here amen and it's just like Joshua right here he he was preparing himself and the people were preparing in himself themselves for something because it was time for God's promise to be fulfilled just like it's time for his promise to be fulfilled in your life amen he promised us a body change we're on the we're on the verge of seeing that amen he promised us that he we would see our loved ones amen resurrected those that have gone before us amen we know that that's in the scripture that's got to be fulfilled cuz it hasn't been fulfilled yet amen we're on the cusp of that amen things are shaping up around the world things are things are are shaping up Amen to get you to the point amen where you're going to see your loved ones amen and from then on we we're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling and eye and meet him in the air praise the Lord that's not a story that's in the word and if you believe the word amen God can't lie he's going to fulfill his word amen because he as he promised Abraham many years back amen the he he was going to be with Joshua amen as they crossed over to the to the to the promised land so is it going to be for us when we cross over into that into that Promised Land we know that we're in the promised land amen the promised land is this word the life in the Holy Ghost amen this message that we believe amen praise God but Joshua was an older man know they say that that that that uh the you know Colonel Sanders was the he built KFC when he was an when he was an older man and look at the empire that it is now and some and some will fight you if you know I I prefer KFC over Popeyes and Popeyes over KFC you know but when the man is whatever you want you know chicken is chicken to me it's just depends on how it's fried that's that's that's what I'm more concerned about what kind of oil is being used but anyways um but that that that that man built that that restaurant when he was an older man you see and so now sometimes we think that that Lord the Lord can't use us now that we're older but but you know what God God likes for there to be some maturity there amen God likes for there to be some some some maturity but we know that in the scriptures there's also young people that were used as well look at little David and and and and and Mary when she had God used her as a teenager to uh uh to give her the promise to fulfill something that was not even what had not even happened in the world before for a virgin to conceive that had never happened before and it was strange but it happened in Mary's life and she was only about 16 or 17 years old so you see God can use whatever he wants to use or whoever how how old they are it's just if they're if they're willing vessels am amen and Joshua was a willing vessel amen and that's what we want to be just willing vessels now the word courage this is what it means it means it's the ability to act on what we know is right and good amen and also to dare to do what we should or must all right in the hour that we're living in many people um we know that there's a lot of people that show and they act like they're showing courage right but in reality many don't even know what they believe they don't understand what they stand for therefore they fall for anything and when you don't have a goal when when you don't understand what you believe in this hour amen you are susceptible to fall for whatever comes at you it's a sad situation amen because there our young people and and even us adults if we're not careful we're bombarded by every angle Satan has got extra guns pointed at at the believer in this hour more than any other time amen because we have access to all kinds of information now and so one day we feel good with this particular type of information and and we get to binging on that right oh man oh this is this is good this is this is new and then finally we just get bored of that and and we go to the next thing to B joh oh man yeah I love like oh man this is this is great this is awesome no nothing can can beat this but again that that eventually gets old so then you go to the next thing and you're not getting satisfaction because it has if definitely if it has nothing to do with the word of God it does not bring you satisfaction it brings you temporal pleasure yeah and it brings you information but it doesn't give you that full satisfaction that you really desire that every man is really Desiring see each and every one of us was born with a thirst how many believe that you were born with a thirst for God right but Satan has come in and perverted that in your life and he'll pervert it with basketball and he'll pervert it with video games and he'll pervert it with with hentai and Anime he'll pervert it with with with uh anything right and it doesn't and it doesn't fulfill your your life brother he'll he'll he'll he'll he'll he'll come in with you with cars but Brother Don you know that doesn't fulfill that's right actually actually probably makes you frustrated more [Laughter] sometimes he'll he'll try to give you anything and I'm not saying anything is wrong with that but but do not allow those things to replace God in your life because God you were you were made to worship God and here comes Satan he wants to be worshiped as well so he'll pervert that worship and you're not praising you're not you're not bowing at the altar of a of a of a hoofed horn uh uh Beast like they portray Satan that's not what Satan does he'll just allow things in your life to take the place of what of God yes sir all right he'll allow things in your life to take the place of God Amen now what is the opposite of courage it's fear amen right that's the opposite of Courage amen so if you if if you don't have courage amen then the only thing that's there is fear and then and fear is a Tormentor abolutely amen fear amen will make you have bite your nails down all the way down to the skin and then you're wondering why why is it stinging it's because you're you're you're you have bitten your neck nails down you're so afraid of things that have not even happened yet right I've been there amen but when we put our confidence in the word of God and just encourage ourself through the word let God speak to you and let him let him say let him uh uh give you uh that courage Amen to move forward amen then things then things are different amen praise the Lord because fear paralyzes you amen fear paralyzes you but courage amen helps us move ahead amen fear fear is a paralyzer fear fear that's and that's what Satan wants to do he wants to paralyze your walk with Christ amen he wants to paralyze you to just sit there and and and soak in in your situation or in your or in your or in the way or in the way you feel when there's more out there here for you amen but he wants you to just sit right there in your bubble and Suk in your situation and he knows he knows that there's more out there for you and that you're capable of more therefore that's the reason why he has you paralyzed paralyzes you with fear amen amen fear makes you ineffective as well absolutely amen amen fear causes you to be ineffective amen when sometimes when you know that you're capable of doing something you know I I remember one time and this is a this is a strange uh uh uh uh example but I remember when I was 11 I was about 10 years old we had gone to Six Flags for the first time and I had never been to Six Flags before and I had just been to the states for maybe 3 years we went to Six Flags and I saw the the rids down there in at in Atlanta I don't even know how we even got there either we were living in South Carolina at the time uh because my dad didn't know the roads and the highways that well or anything but we got there so no GPS or anything and from Greenville South Carolina to to Six Flags I think is about 2 and a half hours so we got there and and and and there was this one ride do you remember the ride where the it's a boat that goes down like this and splashes everybody so my parents and uh my dad and my sisters they were trying to get me to get on that and I was like I ain't getting on that no and they tried to get me on there and I saw that they were just happy you know just getting it they got in the line and and they had a good time all I got was wet not from writing on the thing but from the splash I said I'm never getting on that thing well about 3 years later we went back to Six Flags and I grew up a little bit more and I said you know what I'm going to get on that thing and and and it wasn't as bad as I had made it out to be three years prior you see I made it and I actually went on it multiple times came out really soaked yeah but it was fun amen so so so it is it is how it is in life as well you see sometimes we're fearful about what what should we do if I should really go that route but if sometimes we don't know what the will of God is for our life unless we go ahead and take the plunge right because we're sometimes we're waiting for God to give us an audible an audible yes do it and he doesn't do that all the time he may he can and he and he and he may do that but he doesn't do that for the majority of us that doesn't happen so what it is is that you have to if it's scriptural all right there's a test if it's scriptural that's that's that passes that that test okay and then if if if if if you continue to feel that pull then plunge forward as you're doing that as as then the Lord will show you if you fail then we know it wasn't the will of the Lord if it fails if we know it wasn't the will of the Lord for you but if it succeeds then keep moving forward but sometimes we have to take but it takes courage to do that courage in the word right you know it it I I I remember I I remember one time in in in um in Honduras and and I I'll pull it the brothers can can bring up the uh the uh my phone here I'm going to show a quick video real quick being that I'm going to give a little a little report on on on our missions trip but I wanted to show this real quick this right here this was 2 years ago when we had treed up up in the mountain and I was on Horseback about 4 hours trekking up on that mountain to just go preach to some Believers up there and uh and this is just one part of of the of of the let me just go back one part of of of what we were trying to Trek some of it was even steeper than that and they told me they said you want to ride on Horseback or you want to walk I said well let me try riding on Horseback cuz I riding horses isn't an everyday thing for me so let me just go ahead and get on the horse well that's that's the majority of the road right there on the edge of a mountain as we're going up the whole time and I said how is this horse going to get through all these rocks and stuff but that horse has had been through that route many many many many times up and down that mountain Y and that's Brother Juan right there and we'll go ahead and pause it they to so what I did I said I had to just take courage and just get on that horse and just and just and just and just say Lord It's like that horse was God and the rains I'm holding on to the rains it's like the word right and I'll just let that horse just take me where it needs to and that horse got me up there I threw that thing I was riding on that horse for about 45 minutes until I had to get up because it was really hurting my legs I walked the rest of the way but I did not know there was many times where that horse was like how he would just jerk me back like that and I would just hold on but he knew how to get up there he did all right and it's just how it's just how God is God God's been this way before God's been you amen he understands being a teenager he understands being you as a human being and he's given us his word so all we got to do is just hold on to that word the word says it amen I believe it amen and just let the word guide us and lead us to the top amen praise the Lord Jesus because he has the answers he knows the way but you know what it takes courage to do that it takes courage for you to have faith in his word amen you can cut that off for now Brothers amen so uh uh that was what I had to do to to conquer that fear is just get on the horse and let the horse do its thing amen praise God now Isaiah 41 says this 41:10 says don't be afraid for I Am with You amen don't be discouraged for I am your God amen amen I will strengthen you and help you I will hold hold you up with my Victorious right hand amen and how many know that Jesus Christ is Victorious amen he conquered death hell and the grave he conquered it all and if you're part of him if you're in Christ amen and he's in you then all that's been conquered for you already you have the mighty conqueror within you praise God so why fear death that's right why fear the grave why fear all these things why why fear the things that are coming a ahead uh uh you know because I don't know what's coming ahead but why fear it when when he's already conquered everything otherwise you know his death and the burial and his resurrection and all of that was in vain if he didn't conquer death hell and the grave and he stood up Victorious and he said all power is given unto me both in heaven and on earth right amen and you're part of that amen right exactly you're part of that praise God amen amen so let me me ask you all a question where do we get this courage to go on Amen when life seems so hard and problems come to your life where do we get disc courage not where do we get discouraged yeah right but where do we get the courage to move on Amen and it's the only place to get it is the word I'm telling you Mom and Dad can only do so much your your brother can only do so much the pastor at the church can only do so much amen David said I had to encourage myself in the Lord when he was being chased by SE by Saul the King King Saul amen after d after David when David all he was trying to do was help him would play the would play music for him because Saul was demon-possessed right and then when he would play the music he was he was there at rest and then all of a sudden that that that left saw and Ne he next thing you knowah there's a javelin thrown at thrown at him and all David could do was say the only I can only encourage myself in the Lord I don't know what's going on I don't know what's happening to the king but the only thing I can do is encourage myself in God Amen same thing when his when his son amen uh Absalon raised up against him and he was running from his own son amen taking the throne from from David the only thing he could do is encourage himself in God and that's all we can do in this hour amen you know that was that was one of the things that helped me uh a lot during the time you know when when Co hit and all that you know because I I I I I look at the big picture of things and and I don't I didn't know what was going on and and so the only thing I could do was just look to the word and say Lord you're the one who has you're the one who has control of what's going on in the world I don't and I I don't have anybody to give me answers but you have the answer and you have Amen in you have exactly because you know the beginning from the end and you know that get that lifts something from you it lifts it it lifts that burden off of you it lifts that fear from you that lets you know everything's going to be okay because even if I have to go by the grave I'm still a winner that's right even if I have to if even if I have to uh you know go to the other side I'm still a winner amen because I'm in Christ Jesus amen amen see true courage comes from from God's word and courage courage is not confidence in your own strength but confidence in God's strength which is his word amen that is the strength Giver amen that is the strength Giver praise the Lord sometimes God will remove things from our life automatically right you know but but sometimes he doesn't sometimes he knows that that's what you need to keep you humble all right Paul had a a little thorn in his flesh that that he asked God multiple times to take it away from him and God said no my grace is sufficient right right just trust in my grace amen and where do we find his grace in his word amen trust in God's grace not that that that'll help you through amen but I he won't take things away from us when he knows that that thing is keeping us humble Amen in your life amen praise God Amen and and and so you know the Holy Spirit it gives us the boldness Amen to to to move forward you see the the disciples amen they went to the upper room they were scared after Jesus died right they were scared of the Jews they they knew that the they that the Jews knew that they had been with Jesus and and they were scared they didn't even want to go out amen but when they got the Holy Ghost amen they threw open the windows flung open the the the the the doors and preach the word amen amen they got boldness yes amen right they got courage to do that amen so courage comes from the word and what the what is the word the word is life amen amen the word gives you life amen to move forward to plunge ahead when you don't want to right or when you feel like you can't amen it gives you that Mo it's a it's a motivator and and and and and and so that's what Peter had to had to have and because of his sermon amen 3,000 were added to the kingdom that day amen few days before that he wouldn't do that he wouldn't dare do that right he was still he was still there uh uh with the fear of of of of of having denied Jesus and all of that still probably Satan still using that bombarding him in his head even though Jesus had already appeared to them in the shore and cooked the and and and cooked fish with them and ate fish and and did all of that with them and but Satan's probably still bombarding them with with fear and torment and condemnation but when that Holy Ghost came in it was different then amen when you have an experience with God Amen it's different then you're not afraid what the world says you're not afraid what your friends say You're Not Afraid what whoever whoever what whatever may think amen you go in amen because the word is backing you up yes am amen and when the word backs you up amen then no devil in hell amen can come against you they can come against you but you're you they can't defeat you because they've been defeated praise God praise the Lord Jesus amen so this one's here for our young people amen how how do you find the courage to stand to stand firm on your convictions amen you know it was one of the things that we were dealing with and brother Aaron shared it uh this on Sunday that um we were trying to at the Youth Camp there in Honduras we were trying to help uh their our young people to understand and to know what they believe right uh some of us do not understand what we believe and and and if you don't understand what we believe then Satan will just pull all kinds of things around you and and so we were trying to say why do we believe that that God sent a prophet why do we believe that baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is scriptural why give us a reason amen what does Malachi 4 amen verses 5 4 5 and 6 what is that what is that what is Revelations 10:7 all those foundational message things amen and some of them you know you would ask the questions and they they did not know the answers foundational message things they did not know the answers so there's still a lot of work to do but you know what we can't all do it I can't give you all the answers and I can't I can't go over there and pump them in your head and it takes a relationship between you and God it takes a desire for you to want to know more about the word then you will be able to understand what the word is about amen but in Esther chapter 3: 2 it says but Mori refused to bow down or show hmon respect amen I like that story amen he defied hmon because hmon hmon uh uh he uh he the way he disrespected or the he he just didn't like Hon's uh what what his his his intentions you see and so uh Mori wasn't afraid of what hmon could do to him or what he was defying amen what he was what he was because he was against God you see so it takes it takes courage Amen to stand firm on what you believe if somebody asks you what do you believe why do you believe it amen have courage to tell them why if you know why right but then also have courage to tell them if you don't know then I don't know but I could take you to someone that can that can that might know tell them that amen give him my phone number brother Wade would love to have his phone number passed out you know same thing with brother [Laughter] Bob because you know what there's there's people that that really want to know and and if you don't know if you don't feel like comfortable about about about explaining your faith to people well you first of all you have to work on that you need to know what you believe all right I encourage each one of us not just our young people each one of you to know what you stand for but then if you don't really know then say okay I know someone that can help you here here's their phone number and if they really interested they'll call right and we will do whatever we can to help you see sometimes you know we get busy in things and and and we just try to do what we can you see but we if somebody wants to know about the Lord amen that's that's missionary work within within America amen praise God amen amen you're you're not I I if if you're more concerned about what others think than than about what God thinks then you're going to lack courage y that's right you're going to lack courage and you're going to be wishy-washy right you're going to be wishy-washy in what in what you're standing for and some and imagine if if Joshua was wishy-washy they would have never crossed over to that to that Promised Land right right amen but Joshua had to know that he know that he knew that God was with him amen amen then he was able to he was able to forge ah head amen now there the question too are there consequences with having courage and the answer is yes there's good consequences but there sometimes there's bad consequences as well amen we could take for example in Daniel Amen the three Hebrew the three Hebrew children that were delivered right they had courage to stand against the proclamation of the king who said if you don't bow down to my image amen then you're going to be sent into a into a burning oven that's that's burning seven times harder but they defied that Proclamation said we're not we're not bowing down to you we only bow down to God and God stood for that courage God stood for them for standing amen for him amen so don't be afraid to stand stand for him because he'll stand for you at the at the day of judgment amen he'll stand for you when you stand for him he's already stood for you that's righten he was hanging naked on a cross spit upon uh beard half all yanked out blood dripping down he looked like hamburger meat stood stand on the cross for you and he wasn't the way the Catholics portray him on the cross he didn't have a clout over him he was fully naked what a shameful thing that our Lord the god of Heaven creator of Heaven and Earth amen stood that for you and you can't stand for him Amen in front of this world out here amen you're afraid and and and and and you put other things ahead of God because you think those things are more important whatever it is boys or or or or or things in in your life amen God is more important amen football whatever it is amen that's not going to save you in the long run that's right amen but standing for God's word will amen standing for his word will amen it's it worked for the three Hebrew children it'll work for you in this day and hour that we're living in amen but you now Jesus he stood for what's right but it caused him his death he had courage to do so but it caused him his death amen the disciples they stood for what was right and you can see each one of them got got heads chopped off and and and they got they got martyred for standing for the word amen but were they losers in the end they were not losers in the End Amen praise God the Christian Martyrs that we read about in the fox's book of Martyrs amen they stood it for what's right they had courage to stand amen when there was Lions there were there were there was uh loosed upon them in their Arena and people were watching and them and laughing and making SP making sport of them and they're sitting there with their children you've seen the pictures with their children and just hugging them and just and just just looking up to God and say Lord you can you if you can you can watch you can uh Deliver Us from this but if you don't I'm not going to Bow I'm not going to bow to that Co the Catholic proclamations amen amen do we have that boldness in this hour amen do we have that courage amen but that courage comes from the word right amen standing up for what's right can get you in trouble with with corrupt people it can get you in trouble with the government it can get you in trouble on YouTube yeah if you have a YouTube channel it can get you in trouble with with with on social media it can get you in trouble on Facebook it can get you in trouble amen standing up for what's right amen but I I'd rather amen get in trouble amen with man for standing up what's right than be in trouble with God in the L at the end time amen I'd rather that 10 times hundred times over because the Bible says Jesus said don't be afraid of man that can destroy just the body but be AF but fear God that can destroy the body and the soulen and the soul is what's supposed to live eternally amen amen and so when you stand for God he stands for you amen amen praise the Lord Joshua 1 n again and then with this I'll finish so we can and it says here have not I commanded thee be strong be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid in 2024 amen neither be thou dismayed amen for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest amen I put my name personally on that and I hope that you do as well no matter what age amen where that wher soever thou goest amen God is with you because he promised that he would amen he said he will never leave us nor forsake us he didn't give us the the the trials that we were going to be in he didn't he didn't explain or write him down for us this is what's going to happen to you no he just said I'll be with you that's all he said and so that's all that matters to me that's all that counts amen because he said it I believe it absolutely and that settles it amen you love the Lord praise God Amen let's let's uh look here a couple of pictures of the brothers if the brothers can uh bring up uh my uh phone here again now remember before we left and and some of you all who were there on the service um on the service uh when we were here um the last service before we left to Honduras brother Wade was was praying we was praying and he said we want to see Miracles we want to hear about miracles we got some miracles to amen praise the Lord and it was it was God God did amen and actually it was things that even the Lord has been doing in the last two years that we didn't even even know about so we'll we'll we'll we'll explain that here in just a moment but uh um but yall can see this okay we'll just do the best here that we can um this is uh in in and I'm not going to give everything the brother brother Aon did a great job on Sunday and explaining what we did when I was with him and uh and I appreciate his his accolades because I wasn't expecting none of that but I appreciate that brother Aaron if you're listening um it's it's just the Lord you know the Lord's the one that's on on time and I I give him the glory you see but but if it blessed him then I'm I'm thankful that my brother was blessed and it was really it was a privilege to work with brother Aaron as well amen um he's not a complainer and I could take him to Honduras again any time he won't he'll eat what's been front of him at least he'll try he'll try it and uh and if he if he doesn't like it he'll at least eat a little portion of it and say brother you don't want to no it's fine I okay well I give you props because you tried some people don't even try what's giv given them and they realize they don't realize what's what's that that it's good they don't even want to try it but I give him the props to do so brother Bob did the same thing as well in Nicaragua so so that's good that's good I was always told is I'm not going to say something's bad if I've never tried it right there you go I don't care what it looks like I can't say that you can't you really can't you have to try it then you realize man that's better than the cheeseburgers I eat here in America all right anyways this is um so when when we in altoo the mountain range where we were at where we were about over 5,000 ft in elevation um um and the church that we were visiting at over there um we had to walk you Drive about 10 minutes to a specific point and then from there you there's no way to get into the church and you have to walk about 15 minutes to and you're like on the edge of the mountain walking walking uh the the the throughout throughout the uh to get to church so here we are and there's Michael right there we're carrying equipment uh for for their for for the sound um and so there's some some there's some uh little treacherous areas but that's how they get to church and I was I was surprised because older ladies are walking this road this route uh older older man and and and uh and and that that's how they get to church now the reason why I'm showing this is because when we got there this was a sister that was there at the church how old is she sweetheart 76 sister nicolasa is her name the the night before I had I had preached at at her house we had a uh we had a uh a service at her house and I had ministered in her house and um I did not know I preached a faith building message to them but I did not know that she had two years prior she had she had a problem with her hip and uh and her leg leg of it it broke her hip had broken but then in that transition of her hip had being broken she also had gotten a uh it was an ulcer down on the same leg and so um she was battling with that but then one day when when she got diagnosed with that at the doctor's office this is the testimony she was telling me um she said that um the doctor said that you're going to you have this and she told the doctor she said I I refuse to have that I refuse it and so she went home and she just have faith in God trusting in God well uh sometime later she went back to the doctor and the doctor told her she was much better like you know she had gotten much better everything was healing up faster than than what the doctor was expecting it for the doctor wasn't even giving her hopes about that leg he told her that you're not going to be able to walk you're not going to be able to walk at all on that leg anymore so you're just going to have to use either crutches or be pushed on a wheelchair but she refused that and so the doctor the doctor was so impressed with her with her uh with what she um she had um you know how how good she had gotten that the doctor said well well I don't know what had happened but if it's something that has to do with the Lord why don't you pray for me I need for you to pray for me and so she the doctor asked her to pray for him and I thought that that was incredible well two years had passed that she could not have she could not walk that that path to go to church uh 15 minutes but when we got there that morning she was the first one there that was the first time that she had gone to church in two years hey and she went by herself there was a little boy there was I think it was one of her nephews that was that helped her I think he was like 10 11 years old maybe he was there with her but she walked she was the first one there we weren't expecting for her to be there even her her her her her um her grandson which is brother hoel right here right here was didn't even know that she was going to be there and but it surprised all of them because that was the first time in two years that she had gone to church so I believe whatever whatever God did that that that just said you know what whatever this brother preached in my house I'm going to church the next day and so I just thank God for that so y'all remember Sister nicolasa in prayer she's very a precious sister and and uh really encourag that's not that day after we uh after we uh we uh preached there at the church um this young brother came up to us and uh he said that he was having trouble with his eyesight and he was only he's only about 14 years old and uh we thought we thought maybe uh you know it was just that he needs glasses or something like that but um apparently this young man around when he was 2 years old he almost died um and uh he had he had he had a lot of uh seizures and there was a point where where the parents almost lost him but the Lord took him took him out of that and uh but he's been having problems with his Vision so we prayed for the brother the Young Brother well they they they we we gave him prayer cloths as well they told us a couple of days later that he was there U his dad had a had a little splint splinter in his hand and so uh he was there trying to help his dad take the splinter out of his hand and so his dad couldn't even see the Splinter but the boy was looking at the Splinter and he said Dad I see it right there and he said that they could he couldn't see that that he wasn't capable of even seeing anything like that his dad couldn't see the Splinter but he could see it he helped him take it out so I believe God's doing something in that young boy's Vision y' yall just remember continue to remember him in prayer amen that God that God would U just fully restore his vision we know that God can now these are some of the some of the uh food that that that we used at the Youth Camp uh these are bags of beans and uh that some of you all helped uh uh pay for this is one of our brothers the brothers that we work with there Minister brother uh this is his son uh this is some of the beans so what they did is some some of the brothers from another part of region of Honduras they took care of the be the beans another Brothers took care of the beef another they all just pitched in you see to bring it all at the the youth camp and so um there's some of the sisters uh this is Brother Eric's mom uh sister Nidia and she's there helping prepare some of that meat in her kitchen there's some of the meat right there that's pork uh beef I don't oh yes flour and and other and some toilet paper there at the top that was going to be used there's there's some of that right there what is this sweetheart okay this part of the meat okay I got to have my help meat to help me with this meat here amen this is some of the toilet paper and and some of the things that were going to be used there at the camp this is flour right amen see uh and rice and there's there it is at the camp and there's some of it being cooked um and there here some of the sisters uh cooking uh this is Brother Eric he's carrying some bananas or plantains yeah we we we had a little joke with him because we were calling him Arthur Arthur the little cartoon [Laughter] character the sweater that that was a a joke we had going on with them actually Zoe came up with that this is a sister uh she's using a um I believe they had a little generator out there and so she needed to blend something on the blender so that's what she's doing right there um and then here's I think this is a video um and get an idea of of them serving uh some of the plates that they would serve yes manyal how many meals sweetheart were served oh three times a day there was three meals Ser three times a day there was a 207 about 275 280 campers that went but that that's just for kids and that doesn't count the adults that were there that they ate two to three times a day as well and so there was actually more more that because we were just counting just for the kids but even adults were able to eat as well and so we just thank God you know what $3,000 goes a long way in those places you see for for four days four days of camp or three three days of camp and here's some of the here's some of the sisters already have some some of the plates served um ready uh they would just serve them as they know that that that the service is about to end they have them ready served so that the kids can just go up there and grab start grabbing plates here's some of the plates everything that they eat is always has a tortilla to go with it and uh did somebody say something yeah amen especially if they're corn tortillas yeah this is a frier right yeah and so they they use that I think this is what the brother um brother Heraldo he has a restaurant there in the city and so he brought some of his equipment from his restaurant and he goes to brother Eric's church and so he helped with with that cooking lot I'm going to tell you what brother head Ado H you talking about some chicken now there was one day there was one day where he cooked some chicken let me tell you that was some of the best chicken I've ever had I don't know how he seasoned it or what but man Popeyes KFC none of them churches ain't got nothing on what this brother's chicken was this chicken was good it was some good chicken I wish we had a picture of brother Hadad though um brother Jewel would probably want to stay in Honduras if he tried that [Laughter] chicken uh that's uh some of the food prep there uh there's some of the sisters prepping um yeah grating some cheese right right sweetheart and then there's there's some some of them cutting some vegetables now while we were there Christine before we left we bought some some equipment on on Amazon to to help them uh cut things faster and so when we got there and we showed them that the sisters were they were about to dance for before the Lord when they saw that that there was like chopping onions and tomatoes so fast so uh we ended up getting another one uh or another sister s brother Eric's mom had something similar like that already and they took that there to also help speed things up we also got them while we were there some some juicers to help juice because they would make lemonade for the for the kids and they would send their hand squeezing all the lemons in this big old in this big old I don't know how many gallons bucket and but so we got them some of that with that money as well some of the funds that you all had given as well and it helped them uh there's brother H Ido right there the brother that that has the restaurant he probably there cooking that chicken right there all right now I wanted to show show you all this picture that we had there was two or three days where we had to rent a vehicle and uh renting a vehicle over there isn't like renting a vehicle here you know when normally when you rent a vehicle here you get either the previous year model of something or maybe the latest year model not there you get about 15 years uh earlier you're going to drive a 2008 to 2010 and you're going to drive it with with with all the lights on the dashboard all lit up but as long as as long as it runs that's a rented vehicle that's a rented vehicle as long as it runs as long as it breaks so uh we had to do that about two or three times and it was I think it was a 2010 for escape that we were riding but uh that's just normal for them you know that's that's their I think this is another video here this is Christine help him wash dishes yeah as they were as they were um sometimes they would run out of dishes to serve the the the the the the the kids so the sisters they they had to have a specific station to wash dishes constantly and So Christine was there helping with that and there here some of the drinks being served with more meals and um all right so that is that now let me I'll tell tell you tell you these things the those brothers and those sisters down there they really really believe in the power of prayer cloths right they believe that so when we take them prayer cloths they really believe that and two years ago when we had went to Honduras and I had ministered in a specific place called San Loreno which we were at this time again this year Under the Tent that's where they had the ministers meetings um the brother there who's in charge of the church because their Pastor is sick right now and and and everything and uh brother hoel told me he said brother Luis do you remember when we when you gave prayer Clause here two years ago he said he said I want to tell you what happened and so he gave me a one of the testimonies it was a sister a young sister a single mom who had gotten a prayer CLA she had I don't know what she had but she was unable to move uh like she couldn't get up and walk properly um she was having trouble with mobility and she had to take care of her little child so she was having trouble even holding him and things like that well they went to pray for her at the church and they told her and they gave her a prayer cloth um and that sister recovered completely after that she's she was able to help raise her her her little kid and and um he said that she recovered miraculously and she's moving around now am like normal so we just thank God for that amen and when I give them prayer CLA I specifically tell them it's what we tell them what we tell you all here you know the power is not in the prayer cloth amen it's first of all it's scriptural they took in the book of Acts from from Paul his his his his his cloths and and his and his uh handkerchiefs that he had that he would wipe his sweat off because he could he couldn't stop and pray for everybody so people with so much Faith would just grab and just grab whatever they could from him and they would receive the Bible says that they received healing and demons were cast out of people all right so Paul didn't do that amen neither did the prayer cloth it was the faith of the people that God was in that man you see and that if God was was could could heal someone by by him laying hands upon the people then I believe that even even his prayer cloth amen or was able to to to do the miracle for me it's and it was faith in in God and so and so many of the prayer cloths many of them that we took we this time around we took a Ziploc bag full of them all of them are gone all of them are gone and um when we were there in altoo where we were where we were uh uh walking the 15minute route there on to the church there the night before when I had preached at the sis uh at the sister's house there was a a Pentecostal Pastor that was there and and he had taken some of his congregation to the uh to to to to the service well we gave him prayer cloths as well he said he said that a couple of days later his wife started having a pain on her side uh one of the nights and it was really really bad that it was actually he was being he was worried about about it and they thought that they had to take her to the hospital he did not know what it was he remembered that he had gotten the prayer cloth and so he took the prayer cloth he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ put it on the sister on on his wife she just went to sleep and the day after that pain was completely gone was completely gone and so maybe that will that will help him you know to to uh draw you know maybe even know more about this message you see they God still God still heals and and so and then um um the last the last one that I thought and then with this we'll we'll finish but the brother there in San Loreno the one that told me about the sister that was could not move he said that um there was a 18-year-old boy who had to have dialysis so his kidneys were were shutting down was really really bad 18 years old imagine that and um he asked for prayer and they went to pray for him and they and and so brother hoel gave him a prayer cloth one of the prayer cloths that we had given him there two years before he said that the boy this is what he tells me now you know that's that's what he told me he said the boy would put it on his side on on his on his and he said that that prayer cloth would just stick to him and I don't know how that happened but God God's the one who does it he said that that thing would he it was hard for him to remove that prayer cloth so what he told he told that to brother hoel and so brother hoel said just leave it on there said God is doing something leave it on there so he left it on there slept with it everything and he went to have the the the the appointment to start the dialysis but when he got to the appointment and start the dialysis the doctors couldn't even start cuz they said young man something is going on here your kidneys look fine I don't know if we made a mistake or what I don't know what's going on but the boy didn't end up having to have dialysis I believe God gave him you kidneys that's what I believe and uh and and he to this day this boy is fine and they're at the church and uh so um that's uh God still got amen and uh and he said the boy he says afterwards after the the Lord healed him he said now that prayer cloth wouldn't stick to him anymore he said the prayer cloth wouldn't stick to him anymore so brother hoel told him he said just keep the prayer cloth for other other times you see you might need it again so so he he from as far as I know he still has the pray CL those were things that were that were per Claus given out two years before right and I didn't know anything about these things until this this trip so who knows Lord we might be expecting new Miracles and stuff you know on our next trip from from these prayer clocks that we gave out because we gave a lot so God still God Amen and if he can do it for them he can do it for you amen and so God he's still in the healing business you love the Lord am amen let's send to our feet this we're going to have the musicians come and let's just sing something uh uh before we leave um and let's just let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we just thank you Lord once again father because you are still the same
