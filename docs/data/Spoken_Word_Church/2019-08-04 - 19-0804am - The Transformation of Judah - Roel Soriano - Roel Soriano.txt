grace that we are able to finish visit this church again thank the Lord for by the Lewises family and he's being a faithful servant it's been driving us around to different churches and using his donkey and finally the donkey has to be sacrificed I believe they're in good hands and I believe that the Lord will replace the donkey thank you for your donkey by the weight you're using your donkey now okay well sure is a pleasure to be here once again being fellowship in brothers and sisters of like-minded faith and with butter butter Dale and his family this church has been precious to us and they think of you a lot in our prayers amen this morning I just wish to show you a type in the Old Testament in the book of Genesis chapter 37 verse 28 26 to 28 we talked about the story of Joseph we normally focus our attention on Joseph but today we're gonna focus our attention attention on his brother Judah because I'm going to talk about the transformation of Judah he was transformed we'll read verse 26 of chapter 37 Genesis and Judah said unto his brethren what profit if we slay our brother and conceal his blood come let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and let us not let that not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content and then there passed by million i'ts merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the fitbit and sold joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph joseph to egypt but in chapter 24 the same book Genesis 44 I'm sorry Genesis 44 verse 32 this was when Joseph intended to detain the younger brother Benjamin verse 32 we read for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if I bring him not unto thee then I shall burden the blame for my father for ever now therefore I pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the land an abandonment bondman to my lord and let the lad go go up to his brethren for how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come to my father these are the words of the Lord let's pray our Father we humbly come before you this morning and ask that you give us inspiration Lord send anointing both to the speaker and the heroes alike and father may give us a wonderful time in worship and may you extend your hand and reach out to the needs of the people for there are many we want to give you all the praise and honor and glory in the service in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord we pray I mean hey be seated praise the Lord so um I was telling better Samwell that this has been a long trip we will we would have been eight weeks away from home traveling around the u.s. on the 17th of June and or will fly out of Atlanta to go to New York and then on to Manila so you pray for us because we're missing our congregation we're missing our family sister chichi is missing her dogs so that dogs and but it's serious has been a wonderful journey because God we saw God is with us wherever we go amen we want you to pray for the Saints in the Philippines they have forecast a big storm a big typhoon there they say it's equivalent to the type typhoon Haiyan we had about six years ago um and it's kind of strike the country maybe late tonight or tomorrow morning so just be in prayer for the Saints in the Philippines and also I want you to pray for this church in Hong Kong because there's a lot of trouble because of the protests going on there this days because their Chinese is trying to change the laws in Hong Kong you know a Hong Kong used to be under the United Kingdom administration and there are the people they are used to living a democratic life and they used to be so free and now Beijing is trying to clamp down on the Hong Kong residents and trying to change the laws there and they they told the Hong Kong residents you have to accept the fact that you're now part of China you know just like all the other provinces of China but the Hong Kong people they could be they would not take that and now they're now going out on the streets and for protests as many as 2 million people go on the street to protest against the Chinese Chinese government well we know what the Prophet said about communism and you talked about communism China I believe China is the biggest communist country in the world now I thought for for a while that communism has gone down it's gonna fizzle out but better Bannon said that 3 isms will be swallowed up in Communists and Nazis and fascism and communism and we see it happening in our days China becoming a very influential nation in the world that it's considered no superpower one of the 10 I think they ranked a China now as number 3 economic power in the whole world and so we're living in trouble Stein's this AIDS is truly critical and so we think of the church in Hong Kong but the John Durrett was there visited the church in Hong Kong a while back and he ministered for us and they they want to greet you in the name of the Lord but a John and so remember them because the church in Hong Kong my church in Hong Kong is mostly made up of filipinas that migrated to Hong Kong to work as domestic helps so they work there and take a two-year contract and they're only able to come home once a year like they were given a month's leave in a year um to be with their family so you know how tough that would be but sisters are so faithful and the church is actually growing we presented a message to a group they're a little denominational group which is led by a Filipina sister I'm not this is another group it's not much a group it's a new group and they all know not all but seventeen of them received a message and they are now ready to pull away from the big organization so we want to thank the Lord for that amen so praise God going back to our subject Judah you know what could be worse than killing your own brother well Judah made this suggestion instead of killing him why don't we just sell him make a profit make money although our brother and that to me is worse than killing your brother to make money out of your brother but he didn't care he had that I would say Judah had that Judas spirit on him because you know he sold the Lord for thirty pieces of silver and Joseph was sold for about the same amount of money 20 pieces of silver in his time so we understand that Joseph typed Christ hallelujah but I want to show you this morning that Judah types you and me and every Christian believer that has been born into the body of Christ because Judah was a changed person after after they sold Joseph then probably the Lord started dealing with Judah and starting thinking about what happened and when it came time for the family to go back to a chip of course you know the story um I'm just cutting it short because we don't we don't have the time to go through it but they got food from Egypt and Joseph was instrumental in saving the whole family from this great drought and they brought food to the brothers the siblings of Joseph brought food back to Jacob and his family and when supply ran out then they went back again to get some more food and I'm thinking of I'm thinking of the message now you know there's drought taking place in this world not that there's a drought for food there's plenty of food but there's there's a drought for the understanding there's a drought for a true revealed word of the hour there's a there's a there's a famine going on in the whole world today and there's only one place where they can get food it's true Joseph there's only one place where we can get food and nourishment for our souls today and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ and he is the revealed word of the hour I mean the whole world is dying the whole denominational world is dying they have the word but they don't have the revelation of the word praise God um so we're thankful to the Lord that we have a an an ending supply that while the whole world is starving spiritually we are fisting every time we gather here every time we come to church you get to eat of the fresh manna anointed word of the hour hallelujah and so but Joseph's condition was that they had to bring the youngest brother of course Joseph knew that that was his full full-blooded brother Benjamin and we understand that Benjamin typed the 144,000 you know the last of the siblings that will be saved so he was brought with the other siblings to into Egypt and Joseph saw him for the first time and his heart was truly movement after he saw Benjamin and you see Joseph's intention was to keep Benjamin and rescue Benjamin so that Benjamin can live with him and he doesn't doesn't really care about the other brothers but he cared about Benjamin so he wanted to keep him and in order to do so he put of course that that's silver Cup in the sack that Benjamin took with him to take back to their homeland so you know the story he had to detain Benjamin because of it and now look what happened Judah became the hero he became the savior of Benjamin he was willing to get himself arrested so that his brother can be set free he said let I therefore I pray thee that let thy servant a by you can detain me make me a slave do whatever you want to me but set my brother free hallelujah instead of the lad a bondman to my Lord and let me the lad go up with his brethren or for how shall I go up to my father and the lad be not with me less fret for adventure I see the evil that shall come on my father of course he saw how how Jacob was hurt when he lost the first son he thought he lost the first song that was Joseph's hallelujah and and you know the Bible said he he mourned for him for days and the brothers and the sons and daughters they came to him and tried to lead all thing to try to comfort him but he would not be comforted and Judah saw this happening and he didn't want to be responsible for this to happen again to his dad huh so he said you need a servant you need a slave just take me but set this young lad free and let him go back to our Father you see now from being a goat in the beginning who saw this brother for money now he became a hero he became brave he started faith even to be a serpent forever even to give his own life hallelujah for the sake of his brother half-brother and you know what this was actually what what worked on Joseph's emotions when when Judah said this you know he's probably thinking you're willing to do this give your life for you for your half-brother and that was too much for Joseph and that's when he said you get the people out of here and he started to reveal himself to his brother I am Joseph your brother Amen hallelujah hallelujah and it struck me it struck me that a man can be changed from a coward to a hero hallelujah what caused the change say I believe God is showing us a type here that the person can be changed no matter how wicked how obscene how sinful a person has no matter his upbringing whatever it is you know his background God can change that person and make him a new creature second Corinthians chapter five it says if any man be in Christ behold he's a new creature old things pass away that's all your old nature amen and you become a new creature in Christ Jesus hallelujah and how does a person become a part of the body of Christ by one baptism you are baptized in in one body by one spirit baptism and so we thank the Lord amen for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I want you to I want you to know that baptism Lord ghost is still available for all of us amen today it's still the same Holy Ghost that was given poured out on the day of Pentecost we can receive it it's available for you today the same Holy Ghost that filled filled the first questions and when they started speaking in tongues and performing all kinds of miracles in the work of backs will be it's the same Holy Ghost that is present here and here's some available and this experience is a God has made it available for it's one of us today hallelujah see look at Judah he was selfish arrogant he was dishonest he was unloving opportunistic he was a greedy person think of it he was carnal and he was indifferent to people's filling his dad's building he didn't care about his dad's field he didn't care about his brother's feeling oh but but he he went ahead and suggested he brought this idea to his brethren who don't just kill him that let's just sell him we can make money out of this thing see how crooked he was but then he became selfless and he became sensitive and he now is now feeling for other people he now becomes a caring person he loves he's now displaying his love and he's caring for his family's dad and he he now feels responsible and he's not ready to give his life for his little brother hallelujah and because of this Joseph could no longer hold his feelings and he started revealing himself to his brethren hallelujah brother Branham says the baptism of the Holy Ghost will do that to you it will transform your life hallelujah he said transforming he defined it I used to work for a public service company he was a lineman where he had we had transformers and to transform now the word the word means itself something like to transform means something that's been changed something that's changed from one thing to another see it doesn't mean just to repair and do a patch-up job you know it's it's a complete overhaul you become a new creature and then you cannot take your your old personality your old nature into the new birth hallelujah the new birth hallelujah gets rid of your old nature you completely die to yourself so that can Christ can can live in you hallelujah Romans chapter 12 verses 1 to 2 says I beseech you therefore brethren but be by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service in our language today that means this means that's the least that you can do after you've been redeemed and you know Christ died for you he gave up his life in exchange for your soul now you all have this rebirth and this is the most that this is the least that you can do is to present your bodies a living sacrifice hallelujah this is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect feel of God I believe that's most evident change that happens to a person during rebirth after his rebirth you will see less and less of that person and more and more of Christ you we get to manifest less and less of ourselves we become less serfs selfish or self you can accept Center and we become more and more Christ centered hallelujah the more mature we become the more Christ centered you becoming hallelujah your life is changed you become a new bottle for the new wine new vessels for this new message brand new message that came from God in our age hallelujah he said the new wine is put into new bottles the new skin had oil in it because it's flexible of course we understand that bottles then were made out of skin animal skin I understand it a little bit more when after but a Cemil told me how they make wine I think you're make having communion this afternoon okay so and they were having to make your own wine in the Philippines we just buy him from the grocery grocery store because we don't have as much grapes to work with but Bernice amel told me that when they when the wine is made it actually produces some certain kind of gases as it what you call the processor / ferments the fermentation process produces gas and the the the new wine expands that's why new bottles have to be used as vessels so that bourbon says the new skin has oil on it you can't use an old skin because it's dried up so when the when the new wine expands then the vessel the dried-up old skin will crack and it will burst you lose the the wine as well as the vessel but new skin has oil on it when mom said it's flexible and that's that's what we need to be flexible hallelujah and when the Holy Spirit comes down and says the baptism the old spirit is the same today as it ever was divine healing is the same as it ever was that new wine begins begins to spread out and the skin gives with it oh I like that hallelujah this word becomes to spread out and the skin diskin gifts with it every time the Word of God is spits in its power then the new skin will holler amen it will give away so you see the wisdom in a new bottle for a new wine alleluia alleluia you know you cannot put this message into a denominational bottle imagine putting this message in the Catholic Church and the priest starts preaching about the seals know they can do it they'll just burst I mean they can't handle this new wine but thank the Lord amen hallelujah that he has prepared a new breed of people [Music] prepare amen a new creation and the new creation can handle the new wine joy to God hallelujah praise the Lord amen you cannot mix this message with your old denominational cream all denomination blam national idea of traditions you cannot put this message in traditional Christianity when this message come to you everything becomes new hallelujah and you don't try to be a Christian no more because Amen when the new birth happens and you're filled with the Holy Spirit it automatically changes your life becoming christ-like becomes an second nature to you you don't even have to try hallelujah because if you just try to live a Christian life because you're a part of meta message Church you come to a message church so I must live a Christian life I must dress right and you sisters you have to grow your hair long not cut it very bottom said if you don't have the Holy Ghost and everything will just become legalistic to you Alleluia amen because you're just trying to make yourself do it you're trying to discipline yourself hallelujah but if the Holy Ghost come into you he does the disciplining amen you don't do it legally madam said but Amen you're happy to do it you do it in appreciation of your salvation hallelujah and Bertram says it's just like a mainspring of a club or a watch just like the mainspring in a famous watch I'll be talking about Rolex watch when that mainspring sets in the middle of the watch it controls every moment of that watch every moment every single movement of that watch and and that's what's the matter friends he said now I hope you see this I hope it's the Holy Spirit in the middle of your spirit the Bible says a new heart will I give you and a new spirit are given to you hallelujah but after you've taken on a new heart a new spirit from God people are mistaken that that's the Holy Spirit that's not the Holy Spirit huh but God said I will put my spirit in you it becomes the mainspring of the watch the mainspring of our being so that every move every thought everything that we do on this earth hallelu is now controlled by that main strain mainspring hallelujah he says you see the Holy Spirit is in the middle of your spirit it has to be in the middle of your spirit your thinking and that what spring makes all the rest of the movements just stick just exactly to the place keeping perfect time when the Holy Spirit is in the middle of your spirit it makes every action of the Holy Spirit in you tick tick off just exactly according to God's timepiece and what is that that's the Bible the world hallelujah see you somebody told me it's so hard to conform to the word it's in our day and age in our scientific age eighths of Technology it is so hard to live a Christian life and I told him it's not hard it's impossible impossible to leave a patient life without the Holy Spirit abiding in us hallelujah thank you Jesus so don't you think that you can make it without the Holy Spirit how we need the Holy Ghost to take full control of our lives hallelujah thank you Jesus and it changed them heard of em said the rising of the Sun he said it changed them any time the baptism of the Holy Ghost happens to a person it changes that person it quickened them it made them different they were made there were a changed people from then on it quickened them from an old life of being a coward think of it they used to be cowards - like the Lion of the tribe of Judah from cords to lie in a tribe of Judah it's interesting that better benin mentioned the tribe of judah here because the lion comes from the tribe of Judah they absolutely face martyrdom nailed to crosses crucified upside down burnt and thrown into the lines then no more courts courts about them that has no victory over them at all the dynamics was in the mechanics yes sir it quickened their mortal bodies aren't you glad glad that there is a promised bride that will come on the scene and the bride is not just mechanics it's not just tapes and books amen its mechanics and dynamics amen tapes and books the word the written word will cut will will bring you to death without the dynamics its dynamics its the dynamics the Holy Spirit of God that brings it to life this is the quickening power of the Holy Spirit is what gives you illumination about the Word of God hallelujah so brother BAM says this there's no need there's no use giving your car a civilized job young people probably don't understand what civilized job is well today in our language we call it Auto Detailing what what use what good will it do to us to the Auto Detail an old car rusty no use no use in putting a new engine on that old car hallelujah but even if you put a new engine in that car put a new heart so to speak in that car verbum says I don't care if it's a new engine if it's a brand new car the paint is all shiny up all series are you can smell that it's new hallelujah but it will get you no hair without the spark I don't care if it's filled with gas you put a full tank on it filled with gas or diesel hungry what without the spark of the Holy Ghost without that electricity hallelujah it won't run amen aren't you thankful that the bride aid system but we don't we don't just have the books and tape you don't have just have the the mechanics because everybody has the mechanics everybody has the table on their phones now Alleluia but even if you have the a pin on your phone if you don't have the mechanics you'll get nowhere you have you need to have the dynamics thank you Jesus hallelujah not just a new heart not just a new spirit but the Holy Spirit has to come into your news amen so that every move every action hallelujah that you make is controlled by the men mainspring which is the Holy Spirit so why Judah James is 49 verse 10 says the scepter that's the scepter is the is the that stick that the the king holds in his hand it's the stick of Authority the scepter shall not depart from Judah it had been prophesied that this king that would come will come from the lineage of Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto Him shall the gathering of the people be hallelujah so the Messiah was prophesied to come under the lineage of Judah no wonder it was Judah Amen that came out stepped out and saved Benjamin hallelujah he became the savior of Benjamin I hope you're seeing the type now though he was a coward at first he was materialistic at first he was selfish he was just thinking of himself he was the thinking of the world fairness of his brother at first but then God changed that hallelujah and he became he was willing to give give his slide to save in order to save his half-brother hallelujah so why did they have to be Judah because it was prophesied in the world Jesus Christ had to come through the lineage of Judah hallelujah the Savior will come from his lineage take me instead like Moses who said black my name out of the book God could not do it he couldn't go against his own program was it Moses it wasn't Moses it was the Christ in Moses hallelujah hallelujah Exodus chapter 32 this was when Moses asked the Lord to blood his name out said you know if thou will forgive their sin because it's the Israelites you know after having seen the hand of God move so mightily amongst the in the myths they were still stubborn they still complained all they do was see the negatives and Moses was being aggravated and then but he said he said this before God he was praying to God yet now if you will forgive their sin Moses interceded for the nation of Israel and ask God to forgive their sins hallelujah and if not if you won't forget their sin though don't kill him but me said I pray thee out of my book which now is written you see this was Christ in Moses hallelujah kill me instead take my name out of your book and God could not do it hallelujah God can never take a name that has been predestined ated placed there before the foundation of the world out of the book of life oh my that's how confident Moses was that's how confident Christ was that he would never lose a single one of them hallelujah every single one of those predestinated seed will come hallelujah thank you Jesus hallelujah and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever had seen against me him will I block blot out of my book I can't I can't change my program Moses I could blot your name out that would make me a liar if I do that hallelujah so we we know the rest of the story Israel is still a powerful nation up to this very day hallelujah because Moses prayed for them for the people that constantly aggravated him this was Bertram says in this quotation said I remember one time a man named Moses and those people constantly he would we would call it in our southern southern expression I didn't know this was a southern expression aggravated him they continually aggravated him just constantly kept him on the move everything was a murmur or a complain and so forth but Moses but when it come to the showdown when God said separate yourself from them because I'm going to take you and start a nation oh my sometimes as a pastor I felt like Moses I felt like this is just forgetting it and turn my back on my congregation all they give me was problem and just start another word don't you feel like doing that sometimes by the same Oh start another word start the new name nation I'll give you a new nation hallelujah huh because I'm going to take you and start the nation and Moses throws himself in the path of God's wrath oh my said take me and not the people this is the pastor's heart this is the pastor in Moses not these people hallelujah that he called them rebels in rebellion against God and against him yet he loved him so much till he said take me and save them if you don't have if you run out of things to pray for pray for us pastors pray for by the Dale you know it's been on this stuff for many many years now and you don't know the heartache the pain you know the trouble that you know people gave him when they start to criticize and complain and murmur you know say bad things about him we were just you know in a church where some people were spreading some lies about brother Dale you pray for us pray for your pastor love him support him the best that you know how hallelujah Jesus Christ was a lamb a priest when he told when he when you took the sealed book I mean knows that only the lamb was worthy to take the close book speaks of his first coming he was a lamb first when it took the closed-book hallelujah but then he became a lion and so the lion is the one who cried and seven thunders uttered their voices and we understand that Bertram says the thunders they reveal cracks the thunders that's the voice of God amen that reveals God completely this the Ministry of the son of man hallelujah thank you Jesus so the revealer of the word came as a lion who quiet in seven thunders rode he is forty to take the book and open the seals off but remember the lion has prevailed the Bible says he was first a lamb he came first as a lamb and he suffered and was led his death in order to prevail prevailed Bertram says means to overcome you see he had to come as a lamb first in the first coming hallelujah and then he became king when he comes again the second time and second Timothy chapter 2 verse walk just would like to hear it if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us you all want to reign with Christ for a thousand years here on earth hallelujah and I'm looking forward to that day but first you need to suffer without suffering you cannot do it you know don't you think it would be great if just if God just give us character you know just like that we pray for character and God gives us character right there yeah but it doesn't happen that way it doesn't work that way character is a gift you you attain it through much suffering on earth look at the life of Joseph what he had to go through hallelujah first he had to go through suffering you know he had to go through the hatred and the jealousy of the Brethren and then he had to be sold to slavery and in Potiphar's house he was wrongly accused and was imprisoned for it think of it but from the prison God rose him up to sit on the throne the right hand of heaven Pharaoh hallelujah before you can reign before you can get to that position of kingship or rulership of authority first you need to suffer if you don't suffer you can never reign and revelation chapter 5 verse 10 says and he has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on earth oh what a what a what a wonderful thought he has made us hallelujah it speaks about you and me it speaks about the elders and the thousands of the throngs that worship in numbers were crying unto God holy and you are worthy to receive honor and riches and power and glory hallelujah but the lamb has made us kings unto God hallelujah but I'm thankful that he did not only made us kings but he made us kings and priests kings and priests hallelujah before he became because before he becomes a lion he first came as a lamb Jesus Christ was a lamb and took the close book in his first coming when he became becomes a lion the sovereign ruler holding the open book how many understands that hallelujah it's this this is the second coming this is a coming of the Lord hallelujah the second time he's a lion not anymore a lamb but a lion hallelujah but I want to emphasize that before he became king he was first a lion right I'm sorry a king it was first a a priest before he became a lion he was first a lamb hallelujah so I'm thankful that he made us kings but before we can become become kings we need to first be lamps hallelujah so amen we we should not forget that because you know we sometimes we become so Revelator because you know we know all things talk about the Bible we know we know about the mysteries of the Bible and we tend to be up there you know we tend to be self-righteous we tend to be arrogant sometimes hallelujah when we say something it's got to be it we put a period and everything that we say and nothing can change it this is what what Kings do whatever the King says it shall come to pass but remember your priests - amen and priests amen reached it represents the grace of God we have to be representative of the grace and the love of God amen Bertram says grace and loved their twins hallelujah when you love people then Grace will start to begin to project because God so loved the world it projected a savior because of that love hallelujah so we cannot be kings without being priests first remember that alleluia why Judah but ROM says Oh Judah although Beaver shall not go before it between the knees knees which means the the bosom of Judah until Shiloh comes for he'll come through Judah and the lion the symbol of the tribe of Judah has prevailed hallelujah and he has overcome hallelujah and when when the Lion of the tribe of Judah when the Spirit of God comes in to a person and you experienced that new birth it will transform your life it will make you think like better band with thought he said in greatest battle ever thought he said no matter how wrong they are let's not this fellowship or disassociate ourselves with anything oh my I'm thinking of the message movement now you know we think we have the fullness of the word but because we think we are so related we don't want to associate with other people that are not as Revelator as we are and we tend to not fellowship in this group and not fellowship with that group because they don't believe the same way that we do they're not as righteous and they're not as holy they're not as strict as we are think of it no matter how wrong they are but one said that's not this fellowship or disassociate ourselves with anything as slow as we can with us so is that main thing that's the reason you're here and the rapture has not taken place because God wants you to win a soul hallelujah as long as we can win a soul let's go on with with it and wise as a serpent and harmless as a dog Sienna try try to win every soul that we can't oh my goodness I'm thinking of the tribes people in the Philippines remote parts of the Philippines I'm thinking of the eye test it'd be better by the way pitch Minister to some of them when we were in some ballast they came out came down from the mountains because but but a dead one wanted to see them but it was a long trip and you had to go through the rivers you have to eat sir it was a rough trip you need at least three hours to get there so what we did we just called them to the to a place in town to the plains near a village chips house and that's where we gathered them we put up tents and we gathered the tribes people and by the way it was able to minister to them amen he he preached about the name of the Lord he preached about the correct baptism in the name of the Lord hallelujah there are no three persons in one God Godhead but when one God there's only one person amen and and we need to be baptized in that name the name of that one person which is the Lord Jesus Christ and the tribes people took it so well and we've been trying to help to to minister to describes people even though it's tough going to this places you know we're actually helping a brother who works amongst that his own tribe people that itis but her Sousou Garten is his name you met him um butter sauce works and as an evangelist and he goes and sometimes he had to walk seven hours to get to the place and we gave we gave him a motorcycle that he can use but sometimes because of the high water she can ride it through the high waters of the river and he had to walk out in the rain and out in the heat of the Sun and now he's sick now but it has Sousou got that has been sick so you pray for ballet Azusa garden and but we have been helping him it's a great asset to bring this message to his old people tribes people and we're building a big church there and butter this church has given me money to build the church and to put a roof over it and we have assembled the roofing and everything and it's now on the jobsite and we're just waiting for the proper time to install it so that they they can have a place of worship how long you in England right in the mountains of Pinatubo another so I'm thinking I'm thinking about these people you know if we don't go to them oh well if bhadiya seuss did not have that burden to help his people who would hallelujah but better man said as long as we can win us all let's go with it this should be the number one burden of a person that's been with birth born again into the body of Christ by the Spirit of God hallelujah and then he says if a man no matter how much some other one to disagree with him if it doesn't feel that way then there's a lacking of Christ in his life I believe I believe I believe it from this heart or from that person's heart there's a lacking in Christ not his lips but his heart if we he don't Pete he don't feel that way towards humanity I was just breathing we're better man shoot the hands of a man whom a lot of people thought funny yeah he because he was acting funny and when better Benham had an interview with him he had a long title after his name and because and the first question that he asked better benhams was his affiliation and his title um and very BAM said I don't care about titles said it's the human race I'm interested in I'm interested in the human race not the Creed's not your organization your your sect or religion I'm not interested in that not not your color color of your skin but I'm interested in the human race they said I'll shake your hand for that because you're interested in the human race the suburban says if you if you can ask act this way if you cannot work with your brother who disagrees with you if you cannot love somebody who has no qualities that you can love love the unlovable he said then there's a lacking of Christ lacking of Christ in his heart oh god help us God filled this lack in our lives he meant to be able to work with people that don't disagree with us that don't agree with us hallelujah Birnbaum says that was Christ in Adam a trial Christ in the city oh and Daniel Christ in Moses Christ in David it was Jesus the same yesterday today and forever what the Word of God the word being manifested by these prophets so this made Moses asking God to say the people take a slide himself what was that Christ in Moses what was it in Judah that he was willing to give his life amen so that is his brother could be set free what was it hallelujah and that was this was really what or touched the heart of Joseph it's what this Judah was willing to give his life for his half-brother when he when he was the one who who suggested he be sold to to be a slave he didn't care what happened to Joseph hallelujah and Joseph you know he did not he didn't care for the other siblings actually he only cared for the full blood brother Benjamin that's why he wanted to retain him he wanted to let the others go think about it but because of what you did he displayed this this great love for his heart brother he was willing to give his life for the sake of his brother hallelujah that actually what was new what was what what boob Joseph to reveal himself to his brethren he said don't be afraid everything happened for a purpose God allowed all these things to happen in order to preserve life hallelujah and so we know we should not despair things happen in our lives things happen in our families that that are not pleasing sometimes you don't understand hallelujah but you know that all things work together for the good God allows things to happen to preserve life hallelujah Christ in Adam Adam did not forsake Eve he could have easily said oh yes Lord get rid of it you know make me another Eve another woman and God could do that but instead Adam went to her quickly and planted his seed in her bosom because Adam had a revelation if he had the seed of Adam in her hallelujah God could not touch her amen Adam you that as long as he was one with him he was one with her hallelujah God could not touch him why because Adam was a son of God hallelujah so Adam actually redeemed Eve amen hallelujah it was the Christ in Adam it was the Christ in his cycle it was a Christ in Daniel and Daniel prophesied about the seventh weeks of Daniel Amen huh that was he was expressing how much God loved Israel seventh weeks I remember when Peter said Lord how how how often should we put forgave our brethren seven times he thought that was a lot seven times when the Lord said no seventy times seven you might be wondering why seven two weeks that's seven two weeks God God determined upon himself to work in this within the 78 week period to in order to restore Israel my about the seventy weeks of Daniel seventy times seven seventy weeks of Daniel seven is the number of completion and when God forgives you it's a complete forgiveness hallelujah when God restores Israel it's gonna be a complete restoration amen that's why the seven seals are there not the seven mysteries the seven thunders we call it don't think there are seven teachings or seven doctrines now seven represents completion this is a complete revelation of himself when the seals were broken its Christ revealed himself completely to his church why what was the purpose so that the life that was in him can be poured out to the believer hallelujah first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others and that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and we do we do go to good things and we do and that's fine but I'm sure that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't got to turn alive because eternal life is living for others it poopit when it came when you come in the lamp of God does he live he had eternal life because he didn't live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day that you don't live to yourself no more you live for others this is what the Holy Spirit will produce in your life you will have the heart very heart of Christ you will have that mainspring the whole Spirit of God will control every everything every every night every move every decision hallelujah and that you start living yours your life to benefit other people hallelujah may God help us amen to take on this spirit in our lives and receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit don't try because if you keep on trying just fail we need to do is to receive the Holy Ghost and like I said it's available for each one of us today it was available right in Adams time it also made available during the days of the prophets of course we understand that the actual outpouring took place at the beginning of the New Testament at the birth of the church and I want to tell you God has made it available for you and me today you can receive the Spirit of God so that you think less and less of yourself you think more and more of Christ you think more and more of the attributes of Christ a believer is enough to beauty of Christ hallelujah and there are believers that has not heard this message there are believers in the mountains of the Philippines there are believers in the isolated islands in our country we have about 7,000 of them in our country and somebody has to take this message to these people somebody has to know about the love of God somebody has to manifest it before them you know our witness Kona can only be become powerful as they as the people see that what we believe we actually put into practice we actually live what we believe are you living your life for yourself or are you living your life so that other people can benefit let's all stand up thank you Jesus the musician could just come sing he is here hallelujah he is here amen he's here to protect to to make you partakers of his life he is here to
