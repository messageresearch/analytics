here good to be back brother Claude sends his greetings brother Jim Pinkston to each one of you they said greetings and hope everyone's doing well so if you got your Bibles let's go and get straight in to the word we're gonna try to conclude this today and on the to life and this would be the conclusion we've kind of hit on certain things here and there but I kind of want to nail it down and make sure that that would get everything where people can understand we were out in Oklahoma and talking to people out there and it just seems that there's a there's a zeal among the people to know more and it's it's not our job to belittle you and make you think you don't know nothing because God is bringing somebody up God is gonna fulfill what he said regardless of who you are where are you gonna be it does not matter I just want to be part of amen I just want to be part of it I don't want to draw anybody out we want to draw them all in what you need to do is just let it go and let them draw their self out so that's what he's going to come up to they'll just draw their self right out of the picture so I was thinking yesterday you know jesus knew he picked Judas he knew he was gonna do what he did he knew he was the son of perdition but now he's a liar if he didn't say the truth when he called Judas a friend he like Judas there was something about Judas that Jesus liked and he called him friend he call him brother he called him friend but I can see the agony that Jesus was having of that one person among him knowing all along what he would do but yet he never treated you decide on't think any different because you know what when they went to the upper room and he told you this to go do what he was gonna do the other eleven were so deceived they didn't even know he was the one that was going out to sell Jesus out and but jesus knew that so he had he had not treated Judas any different but what he done was is he let Judas manifest itself in other words the same thing we you know he's God's gonna let us manifest ourselves and that's why we're here that's why we've been here 50 something years since the prophets left the scene 60 years a we're gonna show who we are we're gonna come to a maturity show who we are and then we're gonna be out of here and that's that's just the way it's going to be we're gonna leave this place we were talking out there where you know III don't spend a lot of time on the peripherals you know all that stuff is gonna happen to Israel and the Russian of this and that that's gonna happen but it cannot happen without God doing something for us first because signs follow the believer the signs are back here we're up here in the forefront so whatever signs happen God's already done something to us or with us because remember he does it right right reveals that makes it manifest all right so who any and it's not to the Moon and stars it's to you and I at one time at one dispensation he was in the stars amen first Bible then he come to the pyramid then to us well not to say that that has nothing to do sure it's very significant but this bride is what he's got isn't mind on these guys mind on the bride right now and us doing what we're supposed to do in the Word of God so let's read this in first Peter 1 verse 3 and we're going to background just a little bit but then we're going to bring it out close it back together and we'll see what we got did you read the that was the what the questions and answers on the seals you saw that right did you see what brother Branham was doing he was telling those people they wasn't getting it he was telling those people that they wasn't supposed to get it ma'am he said there's he said in other words there's ready there's people walking through here there's voices walking through here but they have nothing to pick it up but now you and I we have the right receptors we have the right crystal in the in the radio to now be able to pick up what the prophet of God is talking about he didn't belittle him he didn't know he didn't call him out he said just live a good Christian life because he knew that there was a group of people on the earth that would have the right receptor and the right they would have the right pressure and they would have actually have the right revelation because look what happened after the seals broke all kind of revelations came out that were false but there's a truth now that we're coming to the honing part like I told you a couple of Sundays ago we're coming to the pencil sharpening this now where God's not cutting big chunks off he's cutting just a little bit and he's he's just he's rubbing that old car and getting it smooth getting ready to paint the car you know he's not he's not beating the dents out I hope he's not beating the dents out and I hope we got to where we we're not at the you know we were a wreck you know and he did start putting this together but now he's smoothing us out getting ready to take us out of here so we love the Lord and love you thanks for your prayers thanks for all the things that we do around here all the people that pick up and do when the other ones are not here we all really appreciate that so first Peter 1 verse 3 through 5 let's pray your heavenly Father we pray that you'll be with us today Lord be the one that does the speaking the hearing you be the one Lord that gives revelation because without you there is none without you it's just a meeting where we read some words and go home my father made this spark home in our hearts and that will be drawn closer to you father that this will literally pull us into a body change literally pull us all the dead Saints out of the ground and we'll go out of here Lord and it will be surely a time like no other time before there's never been a day like this day when Lord you knew that you put us here you gave us a word you equipped us so you're the one that's gonna have to do it Lord because you're on the scene now more than ever in your bride father forgive us of our sins be with us as we read your word Lord just bless us sanctify us be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not here Lord be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father just bless us in Jesus name we pray amen 1st Peter 1 verse 3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according now to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead now we remember the last time we talked we were talking about inheritance alright so we're gonna still continue a little bit on that to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away I like that reserved in heaven for you alright you got that reserved in heaven for you alright who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed right now in the last times right now this is the scripture this is a brother clock now we're talking about some things and he started saying some things but but the point you get out of it is this is the this is a now scripture right now there was times past when we had examples in the Bible it says that the Old Testament was given for example alright it was given for example but this is a now scripture in the last time this time is when that's supposed to be revealed so this must be preached in this hour and be made manifest according to what that just says right there through faith under salvation ready to be revealed in the last time let's read Galatians 2:20 we've been reading it all along I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live even in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me you may be seated in the Lord as a blessing to the reading of the word now I'm going to read this quote that we've read - and then I'll start shouldn't be too long today because I want to I just want to bring a couple of points and then we'll be finished number one quote is thirsting for life we've read this from before listen where did sin begin sin began at the Garden of Eden and sin has an end so if David crying oh Lord my God my soul is thirsting for the end of dry land where no water is for thy loving-kindness is better to me the life there must be two different types of life and there is two types of life and when a man is born in this world he's nothing but a product of sin when he's born because he's from sexual desire he's just a product of sin the Bible says he is he's born in sin shape than income to world speaking lives and yet he's got life you cannot negate that we were sure we were born dead we know that but we have a life that we're living where even when we were sinners we have life and yet he's got life but that life is a perverted life that life was Satan cannot create life he can only pervert what God has created Satan has no way remember Satan doesn't have a seat he had to borrow a seed the Serpent's seed he had to borrow a seed from the serpent - what reproduce and inject his self brother Jewell did a like they said that was the capstone of his of his message on Wednesday night if you missed it you need to listen to it alright there's only one creator that's God he's a good evangelist but boy he can bring some powerful evangelism hey man he's good he's unique he can he can he can step over and do a little bit teaching everyone why Satan couldn't heal medicine couldn't heal there's nothing else can heal but God because he's the only creator and anybody that's intelligent would know enough to know that there's not a medicine drug or nothing in the world can create life alright we've man's trying to do everything in the world but they cannot create life amen God's the only creator and the only one that create life then what does Satan do he perverts that life that God has created that's the first life and that's what we're going to look at in just a minute now we see the diff types of life that's the reason that this means born is a product of Adam and we're going to talk about that in a minute and brother jewel did a good job we in speaking on Adam and Eve which is just the punctuation of what we've been what we've been speaking on you know for months now which was a product of sin from listening to his wife and the wife was a product of sin come from Satan and Adam followed his wife out a perfect type of Christ going with his bride to take her sins as Adam took the sin of even left the garden to be not deceived but willingly walked out with her so was Christ not deceived Satan could not deceive him if thou be the Son of God he knew that he was but he deliberately walked down and took sin for the church he's our sin bear now everything that come out of that look watch this now everything that come out of that cycle of eternal life when that goes back into its cycle again into that ceaseless eternity not one shape form of standing any way will ever enter then here's one Baptist that believes in holiness and we see that that cycle of we look at eternity Lord we've talked about being in a circle but remember we fell out we fell we fell down out of that circle mm that's why they call it the fall but remember it did not disconnect us in the way that like I said before we didn't lose our relationship Adam didn't lose the title or being of the Son of God he's the son of God amen but he lost his fellowship he lost that closeness for him and God could get together and talk face-to-face lived here right Amen so there's what we look and we see that that enmity in genesis 3:15 let me read a few of these and then we're going to talk about corruptible and incorruptible seed and i will put enmity because remember in genesis 3:15 God already knows he knew what happened but he is literally looking at Adam and Adam and Eve has already been pregnant so we see that that there's a new kind of life coming in not that God said that there he said Adam and Eve right I had him and Eve like like brother Jules told me it's Adam and Eve and they were supposed to bring forth God's children and but we know what happened in the fall and then God had to divide or put a division and I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed over here this hand and her seed and we know that a woman doesn't have a seat so we know he was speaking of Christ coming to bring a new life a new birth something that Nicodemus Nicodemus kept falling over here on this side the natural seed amen all right in 1st Peter 1 verse 22 let's read that seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible how by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever now remember this is not this corruptible seed sure we know that it has a compound meaning it's corruptible word but it was the actual seed of Adam that corrupted the whole thing we talked about serpent seed well brother Branham said Adam's seed is one that lost it right amen Adams the one that sold us out America let's read here now and talk about because when you talk of corruptible seed remember that has nothing to do with God there is no corruption in God and then so when you talk about corruption we must be talking about this first life and then because this first life comes from a natural act between a woman and a man a carnal act between a man and a woman and that seed is a natural seed but all they done was is like brother Joel said Satan knew that God said each seed will bring forth of its kind so that's how he can interject himself into the human race because when an act happened God had to step in by his own word think about that God had to step in by his own word and bring cane whatever you want to say God had to give him life the beefs couldn't give him life Eve couldn't give him life God had to give him life listening that's why I believe that all men are able to be saved because God can't say I'm going to bring this person and bring them lost sure we know by the mind of God listen we preach this I don't have to talk I don't have to give you background God knew the histor Cain and he knew what would happen to Judas he knew what would happen to Adolf Hitler but he still give them the same opportunity because he said I hope you have come by the way I said permissive though not perfect well but permissive will comes remember once the seed was planted and Eve that stopped everything right there that stopped God's first program okay which is a line of eternity with no ending and no beginning amen it brought us down to another life and then corruptible though like brother Joel said I've always the Bible tells us we're supposed to cry when the baby's born and rejoice when a saint goes home no what do we do oh pretty little baby that baby is a product of sin and will die eventually amen so why are we so happy when babies are born but that's the first life that's the first life and listen that is permissive will that is all down in this dimension I was thinking the other day we we talked about life light and matter God had to bring that down into this dimension the first three dimensions because of what he said he said each seed will bring forth of his kind so Satan knew that he could bring God he could bring everything down here because remember he fell from up there to here amen so he had to do his due he work down here right my brother Joel said he couldn't do his dirty work through Adam Adam had the mind of God there was no way he could tap in and try don't you think Satan stood and said let me see if I can get to him first just to Satan he has no way you could have got to Adam but the but the one that came out of Adam he knew that what she could bring forth exactly what he's thinking about amen so now the corruptible seed now let's read here in first Corinthians 15:21 for since by man came death but man came also but by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive so when we drop down here redemption was already there I was thinking yesterday you know we we go over into Revelations and we see that there was a white stone right revelations 2 I think I wrote it in the back of my notes revelations 2:17 this is very simple everybody wants another revelation of that I got the revelation yesterday God is writing our names down all right God is writing our names down in Satan's looking over shoulder you say oh he can't do that yeah can he can do that Saint can look over his shoulder st. looked over shoulder but what happens when you put red through red you get what there's your revelation of you white stone God's got your name wrote down and Satan can't see it called this red through red it's white that page to Satan is blank white that page to God has all of his children written on every stone of that page mmm because remember God is not going to ever be defeated and there are certain things that Satan does not know and that's one of them I don't believe he knows your name pretty good to me amen but I could just see old Satan you know he's looking over God's shoulder and he sees there's something in there red and then Jesus just writes over it in his own blood and it totally disappears because read through red is white there it's where you and I are totally hidden from Satan if you're in Christ now if you're not then you're not you know what if you're not your names written in your blood of this earthly journey and if you don't get it wiped out by the blood of Jesus Christ guess what your name is in big bold letters hey man and Satan has read that because you know what that's the book he's gonna be looking at amen that's why you're not how you gonna hold somebody in judgment when the sheet looks like this now if it looks like this this is your worst do's and don'ts and all that other stuff see that's the corruptible seed all corruptible seed has do's and don'ts amen because remember and I'll read it to you in just a minute a little quoted on that came up with your first life you were not born by faith we don't live in our first life in a realm of faith we go outside we get in the car we started we don't pray before we start the car do it we don't pray before we go to the mailbox to get our government check some of y'all some of us have to work to give you your government the moment then boom in inter at the cafe they said where you going I said I'm going to work so I can pay you how do I get off on that I don't know but anyway we don't live by faith in our natural life but now look brother Brown said the same faith that you have to go get in your car and start it he says that's the faith you should have as a Christian what is that God you're going to do it but we don't live but we weren't born by faith come on we worked we don't live by faith in this natural life we live by the law we live by the law and I'll prove it to you here in just a second let's read the quote number two then we'll get back to that I got a little head of myself Revelation chapter 1 but thank God weren't out of this world see so there there you are seeing where it now look I don't mean the church he don't control the church he just controls the world he's how much Satan well he controls the church too now but he said they were his and he's the god of the world Jesus said he was and he is he's the god of the earth has blinded the eyes of the people to go to this earth he's the God of heaven now he rightly don't own this he does not own it but he's forfeited look and Adam forfeit the title deed to it to this all this stuff that we own eternal life and the inheriting of the earth jesus said in Matthew 5 blessed are the meek shall inherit the earth see now we don't have it now and look it wasn't to Adam or any of his seeds okay Adam seed absolutely lost everything - it's not the seed of Adam no matter how much we try to beautify this world and how much we try to make big fine homes and things that's why we don't we don't believe that doctrine that they're teaching in the message that item had to plan this literal seed in the ether savor that proves it right there how can a literal corruptible seed save anybody our problem is that's why we were born this way it's the problem that we have I don't try to turn it into some glorious no listen I'm sorry I know there's children here but remember the Bible says it is undefiled you know it doesn't mean that you don't supposed to have we're humans okay let's don't be monks we weren't made to be monks God said what multiply replenish the earth and we're doing the best we can some of y'all are doing a whole lot better than others we got multiples of four around here for us for no more where's bobbing them they're not bottoms not here when we preach it on gluey goodness gracious but look it still doesn't belong to Adam seed listen Adam forfeited this earth and then so anything that Adam brings forth naturally now listen I'm talking corruptible don't go into in corruption because we're incorruptible now no no we are in corruption now okay we're getting to incorruptible in a minute but in corruption now nothing will inherit the kingdom of God the Bible says flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom amen all right that's why it still doesn't belong to Adam see no siree did not go to Adam see no sir because Satan took it lock stock and barrel for Adam forfeited it all right now Galatians 3:16 explains it all everybody say Amen now - I told him I wouldn't move around sorry brother Jeffrey's back there he's in training now to Abraham he's people at her own wine they're going I don't know what but here explains it now to Abraham now become mine Abraham and his seed were the promises made there was no promise to Adam not Adam seed now that was a promise to Adam the Son of God Genesis 1:26 brother Dale Reddy's this morning Genesis 1:26 God it is not it Genesis 1:26 does not get a promise it is the promise it is the promise in other words the promise is I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it through that Genesis 1:26 man that's the way it's going to be done that's why I love that Genesis 1:26 cuz it just it just takes everything and puts it into one scripture Redemption salvation eternity it's all in Genesis 1:26 now to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he says not and to seeds as a mini so it was not Abraham's natural seed because remember Abraham had the promised son and then he went and got married again and had seven more children so I had nothing and they weren't even counted it shmo wasn't even counting Isaac was counted what for the promise of natural seed not spiritual he says not to seeds as of many but as of one my brother Dale was preaching this morning I see one theophany but many theophanies inside that but not different ones the same one attributes you have to bring attributes now we talked about attributes the other day and to thy seed which is Christ so Genesis 1:26 it's not brother Bram said that wasn't all mankind it's one man that the Alpha knew of God one man coming into view stepping into the forefront and said Here I am all right now look it keeps going let's read it because it gets good and this I say that's a covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dissin all that it should make the promise of none effect what was the promise to Abraham seed you'll possess this land you will have a child you're going to do this you're gonna write unconditional covenant because remember this first life that we live is in conditioner condition the first life look at me the first life we're living right now is under condition you were born a baby you had to eat you had to go to school you had to do this yet that's law and it's proves it right here for if the inheritance be of the law see there it is if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise what is the promise of promises I'm going to give you something with no strings attached the law doesn't do that the law gives you a law with strings attached you do this you get this you do this you don't do that but the promise is God's that I'm gonna do it but God gave it to Abraham by promise so the inheritance is not of the law it's of grace we'll get to that in a minute because we've got to get to the incorruptible part wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions what till the seed should come to the promise was made listen Abraham's seed wasn't in the Old Testament it just tells you right here wherefore then serveth the law the law was added because transgression because the blood of bulls and goats couldn't take away sin it only covered sin that was the law and then until til the seed who is that Christ delay genesis 3:15 the woman's seed come till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator now who's our mediator Christ now a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one is the law then against the promises of God god forbid you can't do away with law right look for if there had been a law given which could have given life so remember the law gives death amen that's your first life if you don't have your first life taken into Christ for your new life you're dead literally dead the Bible says she's what dead while she's living man that's us we're dead that's why little baby so much life and so much bigger and so much man I get tired watching kids sometimes with so much life but that life has taken them right straight to death and then it's the law then against the promises of God god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness would have been by the law but look the scripture take it back to the Word of God but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that what that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe first first life second law first life second left amen but before faith came we were kept under the law what'd I say we were born under the law we were born unbelievers with no faith I don't see how people walk through the world but you know what you walk through the world without God in your life and you didn't have any faith you just you just you know they bring out these shows about zombies that's just about right it's a flesh body with nothing in it but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up cuz in the law you nobody had salvation it's why the Old Testament there was no salvation as far as a new birth shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed and then I like to have to be revealed everybody got that saying man now let's go to the next one the seeds not air with a shot here the seed not one one seed not seeds but one seed these others were not seed of Abraham because Abraham's seed was his faith seed that God was speaking of not his natural seed because after Sarah died Abraham made another woman has 7 sons besides daughters so it wouldn't be Abraham seed it was Abraham's capital SPD 1 and that was Abraham's faith seed pointing to the royal seed that was to come through Abraham's faith not Abraham's first life or natural life but Abraham's spiritual life who took everything contrary to God and called it as those it was not and believed God against hope believed in hope that the real seed that that's the real seed that we're speaking of even you can say Abraham's seed didn't do any good natural even Isaac you know Isaac done the same thing his daddy did he give his life away everybody's got a little rascal like brother Brown said they all got a little hair in the biskits somewhere you know so so our first wife was not born by faith but by law let's get back to that for just a second now look Hebrews 10:1 explains every better watch for the law having a shadow of good things to come now remember a shadow has to have light somewhere to produce a shadow so there was light coming from what the eternal the shadow is us down here amen for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things so I said last Sunday or Sunday before laughs God didn't take a picture you when you were a human eighteen or twenty year old person that picture is preserved before the foundation of the world in God's mind that theophanies what you look like but remember like we've talked about last night I ready to close brother man said God bred this one to this one to this one to this one to this one to this one to get you here God's got control over better for the law having a shadow of good things to come you think about it you go back in your life and think how you got here your first life now look you can't deny your first life it brought you here but your second life is the whole situation you need to be in now because once we talk about incorruptible seed everything is by faith everything we do how many have you seen Jesus Christ down across let me help you so it stripes how many of you saw Paul Peter there's only few of you when I say william branham you hold your hand up brother how one maybe joyce i mean how you know these people existed we have faith we are the faith seed of abraham because what abraham abraham believed God before the baby got here that's our problem we have a problem with our faith our faith is as if God will do this I believe if God will heal me I believe he's a healer that's not the way it's supposed to be our faith is that we believe now and look and see the results because remember signs follow the believers all right but then look it says before the new birth or the new life we were not faith based people we just were not I want you to think back think about yeah you're denying you're denying something if you deny that you were just you were here you just exist if we were looking in the we were down in the airport and you just see thousands of people and they just won't buy with no purpose Bible says brute beefs made for destruction brother Graham called them cannon fodder cuz you know what one day if you're not born again today I'm gonna look y'all in the face if you're not born again today you're going out of existence one day you're not an eternal person you have no attribute of God you are going down I don't wanna say hell hell ain't enough for us to just go out of existence so that's exactly what's going to happen if you're not born again that knew that first life you had is got to what end but the new life never had a beginning or had an end so when you raise up into that new life we're gonna talk about incorruptible seed right here when you raise back up into that new life I never had the beginning I never had an end and remember corruptible corruption stinks just put it on the bottom corruption stinks you see little animal inside the road all blowed up he's corruption he stinks you and I first life to God stinks amen but we must come though we weren't left in this condition let's read first Corinthians 15 now will talk about the incorruptible seed or the faith see because like I said how many of you knew Christ died nobody saw it we're just reading words from a history book right just good fairy tales unless we realize there was a real Abraham and the only way I said to some hundred times on one side 101 you must have like brother Dale said you got to be part of the thinker if you don't have that part you can't understand God's Word if you not if you don't have the one that wrote it inside of you interpreting it for you you can't yeah you can read it no this is great but like we were talking about last night you can know all mysteries all mysteries and not be born again that's what paul says you know all mysteries but once the one that wrote the Bible steps inside of your heart and you look through your human eyes and you see things that you've never seen before that's not Satan giving you a revelation I'll promise you that amen Satan had rather you stay in your first life because you know what that's where he's at he can't touch that new birth he can he cannot touch incorruptible seed because that's the Word of God first Corinthians 15 watts and as we have borne the image of the earthy right now first life we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption so there has to be a dividing line or a separation line between this life and the new life amen behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a wool moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead shall be raised incorruptible there was a brother in their church and brother Clark church that he's right about 80 something years old any way pulled out in front of somebody got killed and he had to lived a real rough life I said bro Clark will never see that again he's a born-again Christian I believe I said we'll never see that corruption anymore brother Tatum will never see brother Tatum he won't walk in the door most of you that knew him he won't walk in the door like this we that is what that's false and you know what when they come walking through that door or through the wall whichever one they won't do that is what God saw we're going to see the absolute mind of God revealed in human flesh again but not with the corruption remember the Bible says to me what we plant them in corruption but we raised them in in corruption I will never see those you know even operation you have a scar you don't have that scar you're not gonna have that errand you're not know what you gonna take out with you I don't think so you know why because it's not so that's part of that first life and then this new life does what it makes you a new creation God has created something boy if you'd see it please no tattoos you got that right for this corruption must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when there's no watch this is he's telling you some izing the whole thing so when this corruption shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is blank screen yeah boo devil death is swallowed up in victory man you are a product of death your first life your product of death but somebody is gonna see that they're already immortal those Jimmy Pinkston out I didn't tell you that brother Jimmy thinks and did a wonderful job Wednesday night we were there talking about immortality brother branham tells us we're already immortal you're already more do you see the immortal means that this you're leaning towards your first life again you're not having faith you're living off of your first life amen then shall pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory that all rights amen first Peter 1 verse 23 back to again being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible see how by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever Genesis 1:26 men is that incorruptible seed that's why I love it so much that's why if you want to have somebody to look to look to that look to that man Matthew 13 verse 24 another parable put he forth I want you to see this for a second another parable he put forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened to a man which saw good seed in his field now remember look the good seed was sown first before the foundation of the world the good seed was sown first he made sure the good seed got in the ground then we're gonna look at your first life is going to come up here in a minute while men slept his enemy came in and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blades were sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also because remember our first life in second life are still together I mean even though we say the life which I now live I live we still live a human first life but remember it's got to be so dead that you don't yield to it you don't yield to that life all right so the servant of the household came and sent her sir that's not down so good seed in thy field from whence has the tares in other words were the tears come from he said unto them an enemy hath done this but watch the servant said unto Him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the first life you root up what the good life so you got in other words you got to live your course here's my point if God knows everything knows where you going to be knows that your birth is what it is knows that you going to heaven why didn't he just when he said I'll put enmity why didn't he just do away with all that and just put us in the future home because we had to make herself manifest the good tears had to make their self manifest from the bad tears are from the from the wheat from the tares here udall sew up the wheat with them let both in other words let both go through seven church ages until the harvest now when is the harvest now the harvest is now and in the time of harvest I will say to the preachers that is in the Bible reapers or preachers gather ye together first the tares in other words what bind the first law that's my that's what mine brother Dale brother Aaron brother Lewis all the other brothers we are trying to bind that tear of your life we're trying to bind those tears that are bothering you and bind them in bundles to burn them leather the wheat into my barn God is going his barn is heaven I don't care you can call a barn and what you want to but God just called heaven a barn all right that's all right that both grow together until the harvest in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers what's the Reapers they go out and physically do the work their laborers amen preachers anybody that helps you in the Word of God you're binding the tares and you're gathering the wheat what you're separating the old life from the new life the life that I now live pulpit amen all right so now let's go to first Peter 1 back again let's be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you so there's got to be a heavenly quality to this incorruptible seed but it says reserved in heaven for you before the foundation of the world now watch let's read what we've been reading in adoption series next quote lookup Jeffrey inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance now remember Jesus didn't leave you an inheritance you got to go away Pais back before that Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me in inheritance and he never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance got you out of the pawn shop another word but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first incorruptible but we had to drop down into corruption because of the fall because of the curse because Jesus wouldn't have been a savior he wouldn't have done this if we had to fail but our inheritance never was marred our inheritance never was forgotten our inheritance never was out of the mind of God he stays constant remember his thoughts are eternal now if he thought of you dying you can't change that he thought of you as the Son of God you can't change that Wow pretty good huh he chose you paragraph 178 let's go down didn't Paul say five verses God by foreknowledge seen exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saying he sent Jesus to save those that he had already chosen and he refers back to the scripture brother Dale has been reading five verses behind this that he chose us in him before there was even a world that's our inheritance God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price the what he's shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us that's our inheritance our inheritance there's no sin nothing you do now let's read this long quote we'll be finished I love this so we're gonna read it on some earning Church age now the church age but listen watch our brother branham brings us all down and puts it all to me this is the conclusion all right this is the conclusion of what we've been for seven or eight services brother Brown said in John 6:37 and 44 it says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I'm shall in no wise cast out no man can come to me except the father draw him and I will raise him up at the last day what a promise John 1:12 2:13 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born look not of blood that's your corruptible seed amen nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Ephesians 1:4 2:5 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love look that we should be holy and without blame the white sheet the white sheet this is what this is blame Satan writes all this down you know he's this brother Gary mine won't fit on this one page but I'm just gonna say this is mine sin but when God gets finished writing it that's what it looks like a man having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and what is his will his will is his word we are today because our father died we are now listening to the will that he left us I'll let that sink in for a minute he's always my inheritance you got to come to the reading of the will to get your inheritance and I didn't go to brother Donny's brother Tom loved me like a son but my name wasn't in the wheel was it why wasn't my name in the wheel that were Susan she stole my red truck anyway why wasn't I in your will oh what Oh what no in his family I wasn't in his family I had another family name same way with God you'd be sitting here today and you're not born again you couldn't give a care if you actually want me to hurt him finish but for the ones that what are in the family this is my inheritance and the reading of the will or the word is where I'm going to get my inheritance amen what brother out his will is his word so it's the reading of the will I like that statement where there's a will there's a way brother how where there's a will there's a way to get back to it amen all right now without getting too involved in the subject this is brother Branham of the sovereignty of God for that we'll take a book in itself let me point out here that according to these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their bride today now he's living in the 1960s because that don't happen in the 2000 women are picking their own husbands now I said husbands I didn't say one hey the Bible says seven women will take hold of one man right Jesus I could say something I'm not Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their Brides today the bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for a husband no sir it is the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride John 15:16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you now according to the Word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world that's what we've been preaching on for months this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1 verse 9 now in Romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you cannot read it any other way listen the heart purpose the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing because she's got the right character she's got the right attribute and she's in the right family God is not going to marry Satan's bride because she is out of character she's had many husbands Oh Baptist Methodist Pentecostal what everyone's saying randomise and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world watch carefully now and see this before there ever was a speck of Stardust before God was God now how many theologians were sitting there that day of course we know that's the church age book but he did preach that sermon they got their going what in the world God is an object of worship and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God only a prophet can say that and he was known only as Eternal Spirit the bride was already in his mind in other words he wasn't sitting there idle he had a plan and a purpose amen she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are eternal are they not the eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal if you can see this you will see many things that's why we've been on it for so long God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that improving that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he has God must be omniscient he is omniscient then he is not learning or is he taking counsel even with himself how many times we talk to herself right God don't talk to herself he is itself his first thought is the right one so he don't have to make another one he don't have to confer all right if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient the best we can say is sometimes he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient now watch this he has never had a new thought about anything because all the stops he always had and always will have knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are eternal and they are real see we can formulate things in our human mind that never comes to pass about ninety nine point eight nine percent of the time right but God his 100 percent of his thoughts always come to pass I always come to pass they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form listen but they are already real and eternal and part of God my brother Dale said this morning brother Branham was correct your soul God God created your soul before the man I tomorrow right there it is he can't I listen people I'm telling you I told them last night we are making ourselves a second person of the Trinity and don't know it yes we are because we're not to the point where we can say we are God yeah we can say where God made manifest in another form everybody goes I love you but do we really believe that do we really believe that no not till we go toward that headstone right there will we ever know that because remember they wasn't a day that Jesus thought he was the devil amen and if we have the mind of Christ which are the same thoughts remember his thoughts are eternal so he can't have a new thought the same thoughts are going there in his mind is going to be transferred to you and I and it's not the thought transferred to this one and then somebody else speaks it and it's that person's thought to the degree that the first life do you understand that but we must beat the mind of Christ he's going to use a group of people to speak through and that get well I'm getting too far ahead see how this works God always had it start for Adam Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed Psalms 139 15 we read this the other day we'll give you a little idea of this my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in the book where all my members written which in continuance were fashioned in other words birth one birth everybody birth when as yet there was none of them that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so then so when Adam was formed the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought expressed and those eternal thoughts were now manifested down through the centuries we could go we find the Moses Jeremiah John the Baptist each one of these were God's eternal thought expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be now to sum it all up now it says that he has chosen us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you cannot get away from that that gives an eternal quality to a group of people like I said back in the scripture before in the end time is the only time that is going to be revealed who we really are hey man I was telling somebody in the back and we'll do a little sermon Allah Jesus tells a parable and he's - he has a man that goes out and he says occupy till I come Moses occupy at a time on earth until Christ came and moved to another dispensation now he's moved through Methodists Baptists he's moved through First Church days all the way through he has had his people but listen there's no other dispensation we go into there's no other prophet to bring us something else there's no other us going into the ground and somebody raising back up this is the only group that is not that it's not that is worried about going down Pol Pot was telling the people look there's got to be other church ages in other words there's got to be other group of people we're gonna die we which are alive and remain he just become the other part amen so we come through now we see though that the eternal quality silhouette is only in this endtime in other words we have heard from our theophany which is the Word of God you say well it's the body somewhere it's the word it's the word and then the word was made flesh the word is what we're dealing with today we have all the Bible and we have all the quotes and we have wonderful preachers that preach sermons you've never had this much information ever even when Jesus was here he was only speaking to a certain group of people but he was prophesying of a group to come and then Paul was prophesying of a group to come even Martin Luther knew he couldn't complete everything so he's prophesying of a group to come because the Justice got to live by faith first because I just told you remember we don't live by faith if you're not born again you live by works you live I do and don't in law and this and that and the other amen you know they make laws for anybody that runs over you know 75 miles an hour on speed only thing they make laws that if anybody runs over 70 miles an hour you can be stopped and you can be fined right hey ma'am right severe penalties Robbie will get you I saw you sitting there before what they'll do like they do as they sit there at our store Denis they you know they sit there with that gun and they go but you know what if you never run over the speed limit listen if you never run over the speed limit that law is not in existence it is not in existence you say I've read all them I've read all them drinking and driving laws I know them drinking travelers rubbing to rout them drinking and rhino then drinking drive Lowe's upside down why why if you never drink and drive that low doesn't exist what am I telling you stay in the mind of God stay in the word of God if you get outside the Word of God there's penalties but if you stay inside the word of god there's promises and then so live inside the Word of God if we brother Ram said if we do something wrong what we go out in other words we runs 85 instead of 70 and we get caught when we go oops well you know the UPS is okay but if you get somebody like Robbie or me you'd get one chance and that was already done I'm gonna write you a ticket right Robbie Moe right yet yep I knew you would so this first life is under the law this whole first life is not even supposed to be here it is not it we are contrary to God as soon as we're born no I'm sorry we're contrary to God as soon as we're conceived because there should be no conception like that that's right now it's allowed to get us here but it never was God's perfect plan but now that we are here though Jesus never come to bring you that inheritance that inheritance has been on the books since the foundation of the world he just made a way for us to what get out of this that we're in and go to that law from the I mean from the law - that word of God and you know why you know why we won't need Bibles brother Larry you know why we won't need this Bible we're not going all of us in be in the city doing this carry a lot brother Brennan why we're gonna be the Living Bible we're gonna be the Living Bible made manifest we will not they will not have to go it's somebody outside the city we were talking about this in Oklahoma somebody outside the city is gonna come up and say tell me about whatever you're gonna have to wait a minute guy go to library let me Google will not be in the future home you will be Google because somebody will ask you a question and guess what you'll know the answer God doesn't have to scratch his head and wonder what the answer no if the man already knows what you're gonna ask him he's gonna have the answer already waiting remember what God said he said before you even think it what a daddy before you even think it I've already got your answer why because he he heard you think it before the foundation of the world he had this all laid out listen why do we fight listening why do we fight we always fight this first life because it's not a faith but once you get born again there's a fight remember what Paul said Paul said there's a warring in my members the thing I would not I do now listen he wasn't warring with that so much when he was taking him Christians and putting him in jail he was just doing what the law said he was doing what what his denomination told him to do right but when he got knocked off that horse he had to go there nice and nice pray for him to get the holy go I've always wondered with he already had a seat any wine and just quick and while God was talking to you really I mean there was God Lord people listen the pure plan of salvation is we were lost but there was a part of us not that part that you daddy bro none of it that your mom and daddy brought but there was a part of us that was sealed up in his will but remember he had to die to release now we're not going tomorrow man Terrence and Anna's not going tomorrow to the lawyer and read mom and dad's will why they're not dead right there must be the death of a testator there must be a death of the family member before a will can be read so the will can be read our crisis already died in this life Christ has already died so everything that was ours he didn't bring it to us it was already there he just made a way of dying that the will can be read back to the children for an inheritance incorruptible let's power here Heavenly Father we pray Lord that we've come to the conclusion of this and we see that truly Paul was looking in a mirror and looking at the past things that he had done to all those Christians and he said the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God I don't live by myself anymore but Christ liveth in me and we see Lord that we've come now to the end of time where we understand these things and we're able to literally as Adam did in the garden shunned the devil and telling me has no part but father when we get to heaven when we get to that future home the Bible says there'll be no whoremongers there'll be no liars there'll be no thieves there'll be no murders and none of those will be in that city it'll only be the pure redeemed that come from this new life Paul spoke it better he says a new creation a new creature lord I pray that from this day forward that will live more that creature that new creation that new life not the first life but the new life that will yield to it so much that death will be destroyed because we know if we lean toward that first life that we are going to pass away but Lord you told us through a little prophet that this end time was the time of the resurrection and change of the body so we put our faith on that that if it be us hallelujah if it not be us hallelujah somebody will stand one day and deny death they'll miss that appointment because it's appointed unto man once to die well there's brother Jimmy Pinkston with saying Wednesday night and I've always said for years we'll just miss our appointment we have appointed that we've been appointed to go you know we've got an appointment tomorrow to go to the doctor Lord but if we miss that appointment then we don't get we don't go so we're going to miss that appointment somebody's going to miss that appointment with death and Lord let it be us let it be this church let it be the bride that we are given charge over Lord that that we as as fellow servants with all the other ministers and deacons and elders and all in this church Lord that will bring all these all these things to light and the people can Lord live a better life live a good full wholesome life in you and Lord I know you've blessed all of us in many things personally and financially and and and everybody in this church but lord I pray now that you bless us spiritually give us a spiritual blessing Lord that we cannot contain may our cup be running so far over till they become a river father we pray that you just be with us now take care of us in the firmament of service if there be any sick here Lord if they'd raise their hand if it'd be anyone sick we're gonna pray now Lord and then go straighten in the communion because but we believe that communion is very important but we pray in the name of Jesus Christ if anybody has a need here in the building Lord that you would take care of that need now may they believe right in their seat let's do it the Gentile way let's do it the way that where we just speak the word and let it be done we believe these things we believe what we spoke Lord we believe Lord that you've come among us and now it's our turn to give back to you Father take the word back to you but let it be made alive in our life probably give us today our daily bread and forgive us of our sins Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen let's go into the communion believe it right believe in that word the ones that we are or the prophets say when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for she'll be an invincible army Satan is already defeated but he'll find out it it's a right time so let's just go into the communion I'm reading from the scriptures and Corinthians says I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me where as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you just use the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep burns we would judge ourselves should we should not be judged now I love this even if we don't do it he'll judge us you'd have to be right but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world what a wonderful time he chastens us keep us from being condemned hmm wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another if any man hungry let him eat at home if you come not together under condemnation the rest will I said in order when I come let's just have a few moments of silent prayer reading one for another Lord would be with each one of us father we thank you for the word that we just heard we believe it and we thank you for the ability to be able to believe in order to understand and then to know that with that same word it has brought forth all these things into us and that Lord we understand what the communion is we're not like the world lost and pondering wondering we know what these things mean what it's all about we thank you thank you for revealing your word into us and guiding us and that your loving grace be with us in Jesus name whether we thank you this bread has been made today for this one purpose or what we're fixing to do Lord then is we burn what's left so we don't try to hold it over that is all in you we love you we thank you sanctify the bread and the protectors but we know this is not no literal body but it represents your body so we thank you for all things we think ask you to sanctify the bread and the protectors together in your love in Jesus name what a wonderful art the time to know the truth and play the saying this is the day right I will say that that day you'll know that's this day the day of this revelation right is coming forward you can we can see who we are what's taking place in the land today we look out we read the newspaper we see what's happening in the world we read the prophets message the Bible we see what's happening in the body right then we we know that we're here it's face you know how long none of our business why did it work about how long we're worried about this being ready against that day let the truth set us free whether we thank you for this wine that's been made for this purpose we ask you now to just sanctify it and the people we know this represents your blood that was shed for us it's not literal but it's a representation somebody as we eat through the piece of bread and we drank the wine lower tomorrow it'll be turn into parts of our body that will help us to grow and we thank you for it we love you we ask you sanctify the wine and it will take her in Jesus name
