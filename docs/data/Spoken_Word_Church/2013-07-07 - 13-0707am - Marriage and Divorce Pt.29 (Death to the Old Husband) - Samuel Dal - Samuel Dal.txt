========================================

uh speak about it and to try to uh help us to understand where we're at all right so let's read romans 7 1-6 no you're not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth but the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband now remember the prophet saying what this is a scriptural thing showing us today this is a time a prophecy of the end time and showing it unto us and he said he's not speaking of necessarily marriage and divorce but he's speaking of the next verse and going on down from there and into verse four see so then if while her husband lives she'll be married to another she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she'll be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law what by the body of jesus christ in other words by the new birth all right that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit under death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we have been using the invisible union as a background point to speak from and i believe that in that message the prophet was covering uh the three things that we've been talking about that he was covering in the invisible union uh the point that our old denominate our old husband that is about was had us bound was the world of sin all right our natural nature and the things of being the way we were born in satan's domain made us with an old husband and that husband had to be dead as paul is saying for us to be married to christ by the new birth all right then we went on from that into covering uh that how that the grace of god had to be given on the point of the natural point of marriage in divorce and in seeing that that god would set the people free if they could believe it and accept it but if you don't believe it uh you know it's not for you uh the new birth is not for you if you don't believe it the promises of god throughout the bible is not for you if you don't believe it everything has got to be believed he that cometh to god must they he must believe that god is it's got to be accepted remember went through we went through those things but see then the grace of god to set us free would be that that old husband or wife or husband in your marital situations that god would take that yoke of bondage off of us and set us free by revelation now not as a thing to be just used as we want to it has to be done according to what uh you know the word of god said then now we're trying to finish it all up because that's the point i i've tried to make to you and i on this message you see we think that our biggest problem is uh the situation of marital life but i've never read were in the bible nor in the prophet's message where a marital situation was blaspheming the holy ghost if you have i'd like to see it that's uh you know i've never read it that way it may give you a lot of problems it may uh hinder us and i've preached it as flat and blunt as i could coming down it may even keep us and make us go by the grave you know because we may not be able to have the faith to stand to be changed but that doesn't mean you can't be saved and because of a marital situation but there is ways in god to correct all things if we believe it all right but that to me is not the vital thing the first thing you must have the new birth all right if you don't have the new work then nothing in the bible is written to you don't worry about marriage and divorce until you get born again don't worry about your marital situation of life until you get born again because it's not even to you i that's why the prophet would say for this followers of this message only it's not for the world you can't take these things to the world and tell them they're set free because they're not it's he that the son is set free and the son is revealed word so then if we don't have the new birth then there's no need to even worry about anything all right see but if we can get to that point of seeing that that new birth that brother brown said that old husband died that old adamic nature that we had by being born as we were in sin shape of an iniquity because of the fall that old husband's got to be dead if he's not dead then we're trying to do like you know have two or three husbands one hanging in the closet to wear him when we want to if we're not dead to the world and the things of the world you know of sin then that old husband's still alive and we're just claiming to be christians but we've got to be christians see and and the prophet said god let that die and he gave us the secret of it he said it was put in the sea of his forgetfulness all right which is really you know the scripture is it is as brother kali was reading it there that as far as this the east is to the west our sins it's not in the scripture about the sea of his forgetfulness that's the prophet expressing it to us as to terminologies of our day to understand it all right but see then he said he let it die we were not capable of killing that old man all right and we were not capable of taking care of our marital situations that's right see so god had to come and let it die all right and then when he can let something die as i tried to explain to you everybody else in the world can look at you and see you and he said well i don't see any difference in them they still look just like they looked before the day they got born again you know well if we keep on living in sin then they got a right to look at us and say they got a problem so then if we got natural situations and we're still running around living with two or three partners or doing what we're doing in adultery then that's not dead and god has to let these things die but to me the main thing is what brother branham said of invisible union he said romans 7 is not necessarily about marriage and divorce he said we know the scripture is but said it's a prophecy for the bride and the end time all right a setting in order of scriptures is a prophecy r o p-r-o-p-e h e c y not s y that's why it's the talking part speaking see why is the sitting in order of scriptures and bringing it to understanding of the word of god all right but see the main thing he said is paul is trying to get us to see that you can't be married to the law and be married to christ at the same time all right then we take law as being you say law to 99 percent of the people who want to say 10 commandments the bible speaks of the law of spirit of life made us free the law of this the law of that there's many many laws that's in the bible and see law then we we come to a conclusion of understanding that law is man's ideas placed upon the word of god they chose law but they didn't get what they wanted i told you they didn't want a book of rules to worry that they had to go out and dig ditches you know every day right they didn't want that they didn't want the pots and the pans and the ordinances and things they didn't want that they just wanted to have something to do in their salvation it was just not enough that god had to say you're my people and the way it is today uh you know you you can't it's hard to get people to accept the fact that jesus christ died and paid our price all we got to do is accept it but ain't there something i've got to do that's the same thing you've done in the garden that's right that's the same thing paul is speaking of he's not just speaking of the law of the ten commandments he said the law is spiritual he said but i'm carnal sold under sin see then the prophet goes into invisible union and using that as saying that our old denominational husband must be not divorced but he must be dead that's right all right but brother dale i'm out of organized religion i left the church amen now that's what i told you the first time i left up to gainesville when i walked into that church i said this statement and i still believe it god got me out of the baptist i got up walked out they didn't run me off they wanted me to stay i got up and walked out because i knew the word was contrary to him but i said now lord you've got me out of the church now get the church out of me now watch that as we're trying to conclude the whole point today see then to me the importance is not just to say it's the new birth because we must have that to start with but watch it in a minute when the prophet says we're free from sin but he said we're bound by our creeds i don't have no creeds i'll tell you that i don't have no temper well why in the pyramid does it have the word temperance after you're born again well all i gotta do is tell you the message that's not the knowledge in the statue of perfect man it's holy ghost knowledge that's holy ghost temperance sometimes he said how to control your temper well i ain't got no temper with god why is your face red you know you're trying to deceive everybody but yourself but you see then we look at it and we say but but i left the church system well amen right that's good don't you think that paul had left the church system but yet he said i must die daily what have you got to die daily if everything is so set free and gone see that old husband always wants to come back now if we're set free from organized religion why do we want to play around with their ideas that's a question i've asked many times right why do we want to play with their ideas why do we want to stay with and use their doctrines and their ideas and there was a lot of good ideas but why do we want to go that away and try to organize this message and the prophet said they'll organize it into the lady of sea he said you won't denominate it you don't see a sign stacked out on the front of the church you know branhamites and things you you don't see that he says you'll organize it into lady osea well it's death to start with organization is so the worst of all things is not our new birth although that must be there it is not our marital life situations of human elements but it's whether or not that old husband of denominationalism is dead or not amen and now remember if it's true as the prophet would say of the invisible union that that old husband must be dead of the world for you to be born again because there can't be two living in you at the same time all right now so then if that's true and if it's trued in our marital situation as i've said to you some people believe the new birth took care of those things well if it did why did the prophet have to preach on it i mean what was the purpose of bringing it i know i'm sorry i'm just blunt and i'm just the way i am i just tell you where i stand and that way you can do what you'd like to about it we had a wonderful time last night at the bible study speaking on the rapture but we never got to it we got started and we didn't get to what we were supposed to been speaking on but i enjoyed it anyway i hope you did and lost part of my voice so if i have to put cough drops in today that's fine but now listen see i believe the major thing in our lives why did the prophet say you come into a marital situation what do you say in marriage and divorce he said because of misinterpreted theology we are in this position our condition today all right that means organized religion because of organized religion you and i have got our problems that's right amen now then organized religion you said but organized religion is baptism no no no no no no eve brother branham said tried to get it organized see she had her own idea she set up her own organization even moses smithing the rock the second time when he was supposed to speak of iraq he said brook ever type in the bible and set up an organization amen that's what i gave you what your prophet said we see our problem is organized religion but i've gone from that brother dale i'm out of the church i want the church out of you and me what is the church people's ideas people's ideas i said even the garden set the first organization in the process of what saying i think is that the basis of the profit of our interpretation or thoughts i think when we don't have a right to think well the bible get no the bible doesn't give you a right to think your constitution gives you that don't get the two intermingled amen the bible don't give you a right to think sheep has no thoughts well you sure take it to where we've got to believe you've got to believe what the word says if we don't believe what the word says then what do we need the word for just burn it throw it away because see that's what they've done with it adolf hitler took the bible and put it on the desk that's what we we see the movie versions we see them taken out and burning the bibles no that was not what he started with because he knew better he knew if he burnt that bible at the beginning they would rebel he put the bible on the school desk and taught them the fallacies or the the contradictions the the wrongness that was in the bible then they took them out and burned them go back and study your history you're not even getting it correct you couldn't have took all the bibles and just throw them away you can't do that that's what it's so gradual and so moving now as the things that are being brought to you and i by the religious system of the world as i told you every one of those people that lined up out there when that um 911 that took place and they all lined up in front of the white house and sung amazing grace whatever what it was and sung the star-spangled banner of the things they were to put every one of them in jail why because they passed the laws it says we can't pray and they were out there praying and singing but you see it's all a deception to get control adolf hitler he knew what he was doing he put them bibles on the desk and taught them the contradictions that's within it well how about today when all of the preachers in this message are laying it before their congregations every day i'm bad brother branham was wrong that he missed it here and he was wrong here the dates was wrong here and what's the difference you know that's what hell's made for that's right it was made for good people amen that's who's gonna be god religious good people he said well no well they killed jesus for what he believed right but you see my point now organization is a people that come together on the same idea see then they form general motors you know att whatever you know they made organizations by people coming together and then in church systems they came together and made methods baptist presbyterian branhamats lula otts no problems he said well you mean you got problems with lulu yeah we've got blue lights and i'm against blue lights you know i don't like anything on the ice on the end of it it was israel to start with and they made it israelites and that messed it up but get my point of what i've been driving at we think we don't have any organized religion but people coming together with the same idea now let's take a little thought of the people of the message idea you know you tell the women it's wrong to cut your hair and paint your face well i think it's all right to do a little bit here don't you see that's organization you're trying to get somebody to agree with you get your ideas together see and form a statement because of your ideas but do you think you're perfect well the bible says i am amen no the bible says he's none good no not one amen that's right what the bible says i'm perfect see when we take man's ideas two souls two lord seventh under virtue proves his father when we take man's ideas we have organized against the word of god and see the next step is denominationalism because the organization is deaf but you see what i've been trying to get you to see that old husband of organized religion which is our ideas contrary to god's word and you don't have to have no group of people to have an organizational spirit eve had one by herself and it caused all this depth now you you think we can get by with our own ideas and talks organization any kind of an idea that we have contrary to the word of god is an organizational spirit and that's what's killing us but but brother dale i think it's this way why was it right i don't know but i think it's that i just think it i think well show it to me in the prophet's message or in the bible well that's just what i think well who's i you know it's kind of like it was i remember brother branham you know they told him in some country over there said we don't want you over here we'll see he had the idea that that all the churches was against him coming so he contacted somebody you know what he found out it was one person's idea everybody else in the country wanted him come on read the message you heard it everybody else wanted him but one man you know what if brother around him would have took that and not went on he would have went on thinking that the whole country was against him it doesn't take a whole lot to be an organization i hope you've caught that point throughout the series because we want to get the marriage in divorce yes you know we want to get the things in that we want to talk about them things and organize against the truth all right but is that old husband dead and we're talking about some of this last night you know that when martin luther protested the catholic church and i didn't write these later after last night you know that a lot of people came out of the catholic church when martin luther protested the church you know what a lot of them started doing read your history they went back and burnt some of those churches some of those synagogues are what you want to call them mosque or whatever you want to call the words for because they said well luther that's what you wanted us to do he didn't want to have he wanted his own reading it on writing i've got some of it at home he wanted to convert the church he didn't want to leave the church they drove him out of the church he wanted to help him don't you don't you want to help people let's go i don't want to go ain't nothing to do with that old stuff over there get on me don't worry about it it's already on people are scared of spirits don't worry about a spirit it can't get on you it's totally defenseless come on tell me what a spirit can do you can't do a thing unless you let it people are scared of cats well i got blood around for it scared of cats you know why because they're sneaky like the cat i'm doing it as a joke telling the truth i told you about the man up there set in a cage for 17 days at a time with brother richard then sit in there and throw ashes and things on him and came out of there pounding on himself so ain't got one ounce of tradition in this whole body fasting for 17 days or so two sisters used to fast no i i'll probably miss the total amount but they would fast like 25 days out of every 30. but when the truth was presented to them about water baptism they turned it down come on they're right you remember some of you older ones remember people in your day but when the truth was presented of the end time message where are they at well what good was all their fasting and doing it didn't bring them to the lord okay that's organized religion but in martin luther's day they burned the churches that they came out of they thought that's what he was teaching he had to come forth and tell him to quit it so what happened those that came out without a revelation of the just shall live by faith went right back into other organizations or formed their own let's go burn the churches we'll get rid of that catholic church we'll just burn the buildings you don't burn spirits all right they did not see the truth of the just shall live by faith they only had words that made them with actions to do what they thought was right all right now listen i was fixing this to leave this part off but i decided we better go on with it to finish at least this message you know that organized religion according to revelation 17 6 i didn't give these for them to pull up but you know that john when he saw the church revelation 17 6 he'd honor he wondered with great admiration he had him deceived revelations 12 and 9 says the whole world was deceived by this great red dragon devil satan the whole world now this is what people don't like for me to read or to say what about a system that was so uh great and and looked so great until it even had the profit deceived now there's one you stop on right you mean it had the prophet to see see i'm glad i can read and read what he says john after having the holy ghost for 60 years before he goes to patmos somewhere in that order you come from 30 up to 95 or something and he's admires that church something that as we read 9 12 9 did it to deceive the whole world organizationalism deceived the whole world you might be quiet he said well the prophet was he deceived well let's just read and see if he was go ahead brother pull up the number one on the notes and let's just see let's just see if the prophet was deceived taken from the third seal paragraph 151 363 320. as i said shoot a gun if you don't hit the target find where it went off and you got to come back to her and to start again then if you go back and you go to nicaea that's where you start again go back anyway from the organization away from all of that church we've been seeing these seals as perfectly look i've always wondered all of my life why i was so against the organizational system not knowing excuse me not the people the people are just like me and you or anything else anybody else but the system that denominational system and i see it right here i never knowed it till now that's right now he never knowed it until then he said it had him deceived well until 1963 when the seals broke your prophet was preaching the white horse rider was the holy spirit is that enough to understand that he was deceived why because light had never shined upon that you remember the story the pyramid mountain that looked down in to see the fields of things and light had never shined on that so it had everybody deceived and even him he comes for the first seal and he gets ready to preach read your books he said i made a most horrible mistake today if the holy spirit had not come and corrected me on something that i was going to preach what was he going to preach that the white horse rider was the holy spirit now brother dale i don't believe that you just formed an organization because you just done what i said to start with you started your own idea or concept that's what he said see then that way when you come forth with what he said you can see why john admired it i don't believe he was necessarily admiring it because of the beautiful churches you know buildings he admired it because he saw the situation of organized religion you know they're wonderful things this church right across over here feeds people just about every sunday billions of dollars is being spent every year by organized religion churches to feed the hungry are you contrary to that brother dale no and neither was the prophet of god what did he say he said i'm not against the organization he said i'm against the system he said you got to have an organism but you don't need an organization right the system system is man's ideas coming together to form a thought or a concept that they're using a system systematically doing things see all right but he said i i didn't know why i was against organized religion so much until the seals broke he said now i see the whole world was deceived by that system that's according to the bible look at the next one number two which is the first seal 63 through 18 paragraph 33 28 he said they wanted it so he would give them a strong delusion okay remember this prostitute of revelation 17 she's a mystery mr babylon the mother of harlots and john admired her just like this man look wait till we get here and watch him watching this horse here and you notice he was what happened was this that he admired her with great admiration what but the mystery was that she drank the blood of the martyrs of of christ a beautiful church set there decked in purple and gold and she had a cup in her hand of filthiness of her fornication now a beautiful church system that had everybody deceived that's organizational religion that's organized religion when you put up a sign and tack it on there bad this method this thing you've denominated that's why they call it the denomination of the baptism denomination method and always an outstanding statement brother random made one time it's long about 62 somewhere in there i can surely find it for you he said the baptist has just become a denomination now the baptists become a organizational system of church and anything like that over a hundred years ago but why did they become a denomination because they turned down his message he come to the whole world with a message and they would have not been denominations of the mess this baptist presbyterian pentecostal sometimes had they accepted the message right but when they turned down the message they denominated and totally died yet the system of it had done over 100 years old or 200 years ago in luther but you see that's where we can't get it correct we want to follow what we think you mean i don't have a right to think no show it to him in the bible show me the prophet's message you've got a right to think for yourself if you've got a right to think we need to follow you we don't need to follow brother brown's message but we followed a man that didn't think he waited until god spoke to him and gave him the understanding because he liked the rest of us in his thinking was wrong come on he said i used to think that god hated me and jesus loved me until i found out there's a self-sane person do you need that quote he said i wouldn't preach on hell until god revealed it to me so we must have had some wrong ideas about that do you understand what i'm getting at i'm getting at what an organization really is it's man's ideas then you'll see why paul is using it as the law and see why brother adam in the individual union says this is a prophecy for the church about law and grace and to see that they chose law because like i said go back to exodus 19 and show me they chose it it looked like and that's what we were all deceived by it looked like god said you're this this this and the people said hey we'll do whatever you say your prophet said the greatest mistake they ever made was they chose law instead of grace or for grace they chose a book of rules of man thinking it was what god wanted and they died all right look at what he goes on to number three and look what the prophet calls these things which is taken from questions and answers law having a shadow 1950 4 5 16 8 69. michael the archangel great one that stands in the presence of god and his angels fought against satan and his angels the red dragon now that's over in the book of revelations right and that's that's in revelations 12 and revelation 12 goes over to israel after we leave but look where the prophet pulls it back over here to show us where we're at they fought against satan and his angels the red dragon we know who the devil is but who was the church there that was the church that's led by the holy spirit and the angels of god fought against the organization and his angels and ministers of light now that's what your prophet had to say that an organization formed by people to fight against see we're organized to the point that we're fighting against organized religion but we form an organism which is the body of christ and we don't go on to organize because an organization's got a period on the end of it right what the prophet say when you write your book writer put a period he said you're you're dead it's like i've told you when this message came don't put a period on the end of this message now you won't like that one either because your prophet didn't put a period he said quote there would be a message of cheer down to the endless ages after we leave here so he didn't purity's message and stop it this is just getting us ready to be able to hear that's right what do you think we're going to do in heaven well we just play harps not quite we're just then going to be able to understand that's right let's get what he's saying all right going down to the last part of it that roman power going into every nation that city that ruled over all the earth he deceived it many churches organizing just like him see making an image unto the beast is that the book of revelations 17th chapter all right yeah but that's not us we can sit right here and dominate and die just like the rest no bless god i'm out of organized religion i ain't having nothing to do with it that can be an organization look at number four because here's one that we're going to talk about a little bit something that the prophet said that he didn't understand why he was against organized religion and why he taught the white horse writer was the holy spirit that's what we're talking about why because look what he says on feast of the trumpets if you think things are horrible and bad just remember in that message just prior to this he's explaining that under eichmann and hitler and mussolini and those where i've just finished reading a book sister trudy had on eichmann where they captured him and he himself had record of killing over six million jews not himself killing them the guy that gave the orders it took them 15 years to find him they finally captured him some of you ought to remember they captured him in about 62 and finally crew hung him and to show you what they done they took his ashes and dumped it out in the ocean you know why because they said they didn't want no monument made to eichmann or a place isn't it kind of odd when what's this last guy's name in laden bin laden however you pronounce it isn't it odd that you remember what they done with his body they took it out in the ocean and dumped it i thought that was an odd coincidence but they didn't want no place left to make a monument in his honor brother random says that the holy ghost was loosed back there or excuse me the systems was loosed to drive the children of israel to the homeland and he said it killed millions of them to drive them to the homeland but he said 20 years later which would have put it 45 to 65 or whatever you want to calculate he said it's reduced on the bride you don't believe it take the word you're at paragraph go back one or two and read it the driver to the message of the hour so you think we're having troubles you know what it's for to drive us to the message of that hour of course the economy is getting tight and it won't be long until we get tired and you won't have money and you'll say well i can't go to church let's read what your prophet had to say about it and remember the system he's talking about had him deceived until the seals broke that statement is what he said go ahead and roll it up where we can start reading paragraph the feast of the trumpets while this group down here got 2 000 got 2 000 bound at the river euphrates and has been bound for 2000 years now you remember that in the scripture he loose knows all right also the church what the church has bound the holy ghost nearly 2 000 years are you reading the church the thing that we thought as the prophet said one day like this he said what was to be the thing to deliver us to save us the church he said wound up being done to crucifies right bound the church has bound the holy ghost for nearly two thousand years under martyrdom back there who killed a christian down to the ages and under the church ages once it's been bound not at the river you say freitas but at the door of creeds and dogmas hiya hiya wake up hard to think when you sleep see this was the river euphrates within bound that would loose under eichmann and hitler them to drive them to homeland but the holy spirit can't work in the church today because of man-made system everybody's got a doctrine and they form together and they make a two soul group a seventh under virgil group a parousia group a son of man group or whatever you want to call it a little ice brother they don't like you call little eyes well what's the difference i don't preach to the world it may go out on the internet they can listen but i'm preaching to you and me what they do out there they're just listening that's right and so people in lula that's letting that organizational system still bind us because listen if you're going to quote quote the prophet if the holy ghost has been bound nearly 2 000 years it's only been 2 000 years since calvary so the holy ghost has never worked correctly well you want to get in the book of acts and let's preach all day right read the book of acts in that book of acts they had people trying to make them go back to circumcision they were supposed to be converted christians amen that's right and you know paul he didn't like that organization that spoke up in peter one day so he rebuked him in front of everybody so the holy ghost has never been free if you're getting my point you think it was in the book of acts your prophet just said it okay not at the river of euphrates but at the door of creeds and dogmas bless god i don't have no creed well what do you believe well i believe glorified is showing something that's an organization come on i think we're gonna follow brother dale that's an organization now paul never said that paul said follow me how is i father christ not father paul i'm a follower of william branham no no i'm a follower of the cross that was in william brown amen not the man then i don't give a hoot what they say about where he was wrong he led me to christ through the revealed word i have no time to argue with him about whether he was at out in arizona when he was supposed to have been that's right you better remember one thing though he said there's where the angels met him so you argue with him about it that's right you dig your own hole and go dive into it to try to be so super religious not realizing why would i want to correct brother branham it would mean that demon in me is wanting to be in charge or be the head man i got enough sense to know that don't follow me follow christ that way when you see me and say well brother dale i think you missed it right here i don't have no problem would you see where i missed it or not listen it's been bound not as that the holy spirit can't work in the church because of manmade system one of the holy ghosts can't work in lula amen and i think he does a lot i think we have a lot of healings and signs and wonders and we can stand and talk about the dead being raised the sick being healed but you go right over there and they can talk about the dead being raised and the sick being healed but can they talk about the word no that's the difference okay but i love this part but she's going to be liberated all right what's going to happen she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the bible said i love the way he talks don't you and those two meet one another on the battlegrounds lucifer and michael again like in the beginning they've been bound almost 2 000 years almost almost 2 000 years but michael and lucifer's to meet over there with the jews that we leave out of here who do you think is battling you who do you think is on the scene now what do we think about it look at the next one this goes over to paragraph 163 of the feast of the trumpet there is that roman empire burned there by what the ecclesiastical powers which rome pagan rome became papal rome and was bound there in its traditions of christianity christians all right it's bound there so what's he's still holding his point right what's binding it christian people whole so-called christian spirit in people and was bound there in its traditions of christians what part of christian and and superstitions it had of rome putting together all these things worship of women oh we don't do that and all these other kind of stuff and christmas days right and holidays and holy days and things it's been bound with that tradition that it cannot let loose because it's against christian principles feel the same ungodly pagan spirit and that spirit called into the nations of the world according to the prophecies of ezekiel and the rest of them holy ghost been bound for two thousand years see because for 2000 years mankind believed the white horse rider was the holy spirit right i just ask you a simple question is that right it was bound by traditions and creeds i told you about the time i was coming home listening to brother brown and talking about how they made all those images and all those things you know and they build them like the sphinx and and all of the things because they build them as guardians right i got home pulling the driveway started dying laughing had two swans sitting there one on each side of the driveway alongside the walkway i thought there ain't no difference we think we're free we'll get to it this afternoon when we finish this thought on it then how the in the day of martin luther something made that man free right yeah what was it but listen to this statement go ahead with number five this is taken from the revelation of jesus christ preaching 1960 1204 morning paragraph 240. and that's the way with a lot of people you're tied down with creeds and denominations listen from the old mother prostitute back there telling you that jesus christ isn't the same and now brother dale we've heard that i used to believe it that way but said i've heard brother around and said 8432 times that he's the same yesterday day and forever and i don't believe that no more well you're burning churches just like the lutherans were the lutherans that didn't get the revelation that luther got without burning churches looked like they were more against organized religion than luther was were willing to kill and there's no such thing as healing there's no baptism in the holy ghost there's none of this stuff like that trying to tell you them you've been tied so long till you still think you're tied and what's he talking about johnny crow right johnny crow was a crow that was tied and after a long time they untied him well he didn't know he's untied so he just still stood in the same place i saw some horses one day doing that i thought of it and we were going by going to work every day and drove by there and they had this electric fence and and you know the horses would come up so close to the fence and and they would eat because electric fence they won't get close to it like a regular fence they know well you know what they moved that thing over about 50 feet you know it took over a week of me watching them horses before them horses ever moved a foot across from where they were they were still bound stephen wilson showed me something one day he was out in the backyard at his house he had one of those wire things you know to stop the dog you know in the collar on the dog he said now brother dale the electricity's off the thing's not working he said but watch he throw the frisbee in a dog doggie run and get it he throws a little further the dogger run get it he said watch this he throwed it outside of that rim where that wire was there that dog would not go get that frisbee he was still by him right what did the prophet say you're tied down with creeds and denominations right right why because we believe in what man has said okay and you still think you're tired i'm free but you're tired we're going out place that line right there right i'll have you know i'm free come on cross the line amen step over in the word you know what i'm talking about people this message what are they teaching we we don't dare get into them seals and things because we might get confused no you might find out you are that's what you're afraid of you're afraid of the line that's stuck there come on all right listen and your sin is your only thing that keeps you from being free now what's he saying watching it's because god cut you loose from your unbelief now what's the sin he's talking about i thought we put it all as unbelief read your prophet when i talk we put everything as unbelief is sin and your sin is your only thing that keeps you from being free what sin is he speaking of it's because god cut you loose from your unbelief but you're so bound with creeds do you still think you're tired right and what do you say just starving to death right see the hobbling around i'm presbyterian i'm methodist i'm baptist i'm blue lights i'm talking they tell me i'm church of christ these miracles fights there's no such thing the only reason i don't think i'd like for them to do on that is when they say i'm church of christ there's no such thing they ought to say there's no such thing as church of christ but that's not what they're talking about right you poor starved crow wonder what you come along this morning why don't you fly away hallelujah rise up with the wings of a morning and fly away to the sun of righteousness with healing in his wings amen that's it that's it brother sister oh he who the son has cut free is free indeed what about it look at number one at number six look at number seven a wicked in an adulterous generation would seek actor a sign assigned listen let's get number seven it's a two part taken from the indictment number six if we read number six okay look like number six if we hadn't read that come back down okay there we go and our creation denomination has bound many our people lord sin has bound them but today they want to be free they stand like pilate instead of trying to pass them on to somebody else if they raised their hands they wanted to say i want jesus christ i believe there's honest hearted people out there that wants to be free that's the reason the internet system is working i've told you is because i used to go out and people and say brother dale what about this i can't answer you because your pastor won't listen get your password okay you can get the tapes you know my pastor won't let me listen nobody else i've never told any of you here at all that you couldn't listen to somebody else right the only thing i've ever said is you bring in here what somebody else is saying i'll deal with it from the pulpit that's pastor i have to do that part that's not a situation and i never told you you couldn't listen to nobody else why because that's organized religion when you say you can't listen to nobody else much as anybody else all right going now to number seven rolling up to number seven which is the indictment my wicked selfish greed you took the word of life and crucified it before the people and blasphemed it and called it fanaticism which god has raised up in our midst to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever i indict this generation go ahead and put it up you can read all in between but pull it on up to the last part paragraph 274 and through your creeds and your organizations and your denominations with your form of godliness still talking your form of godliness you denied the power of his resurrection now in the message of teaching resurrection done twice millennium's here and all kind of things right but look what he says but the hour has arrived the last days are here when god promised according to malachi 4 that he would raise up in the last days and he turned the hearts of the people back to the original blessing the pentecostal blessing faith of the fathers all right go ahead now to the next one this is paragraph 242 of the feast of the trumpets the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years what but it's to be loosed in the evening time how by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it it's promised okay number nine let's get back to the point now what that old husband for us to be loosed and be free by the end time message that old husband's got to be dead right so to be married to the second this is paragraph 153 of the invisible union the bride of christ you'll be married to the second adam christ the word you must separate yourself by death from your first denominational husband he said well that's only the new birth well he's kind of pulled it all together right because there isn't one of them that can take all the word of god just show me where that one is at oh you say mine two souls says mine seven thunder says mine bruises it says mine lula says mine the other fellow says he is too put them together and you find out you're both wrong as soon as you denominate read revelation 17. you see this you've got to be dead to them things you've got to be dead to that old husband of organized religion all right look what he says on paragraph 159 which would be number 10 of invisible union neither can you bear god's sons of his word to this illegitimate denominational group you cannot do it in your incubator you cannot bring forth a word son of god i am speaking to the church but still you claim to be very religious so was kind the prostitute he's son very religious built alders and offered sacrifices paid his tithe and done everything that any other religious man that would do but he failed to keep the word he failed to have the revelation okay go on to the next paragraph 281 gotta get these two and then we'll quit still on the invisible union and we know that the church could not the pentecostal church by no means by no means could carry out the last day message in his present condition good at congregation says no white can't even agree on one or two words in the bible how are you going to do it it can't do it so you see the nomination is out that's right it's going to be an elected people that's elected for it see now no and so do every one of us know that the whole rank of denominational pentecostals and all are dead what that is to the born-again christian of the message your first husband is dead you know he's dead god let it die now he's the only one can let it die you can't do it i can't kill organized religion you can't either god has to let it die we'll get to it this evening only the revealed word it's finished all these scientific intellectual educational scientific ways a so-called bible school now look at get into that one and try to figure it out scientific intellectual educational system scientific and he's talking about bible school i mean talking about your bible school right come on let's bring it down a little more present in the hour when all of these young people go into youth camps and we send our people to them i'm glad of it but where do they put a person up there to teach the kids how to get the baptism of the holy ghost no they want a motorcycle hell angels reject to tell about his life why is it every year the same people kids come back to the same altar why don't they tell them about jesus christ and get them born again amen oh that's the educational scientific what is scientific scientific is you know getting everything well don't you think we can get this message together and present it in a special way that everybody will receive it no they won't receive it won't be done separate one this year and trinity's here two this year and over here and down here and such a mess up and call themselves pentecostals get the license this is ending up with the invisible union and he says this paragraph 300. now we're closing and saying this finish up the great commission how could they do it you know they're dead god let it die what this scientific age of all of it he keeps dealing with scientific and you see scientific is what you're thinking scientific is uh you know bombs and nuclears and airplanes and cars uh get over i believe it's in the book of acts if not you'll find it and look where the bible says that science so called go read your bible and see if it's not in there science so called he's talking about religious systems you see why then the prophet would keep saying science scientific for once god let it die this scientifically age of all so he could do what open up the seven seal mystery to the undenominational bride how can our denomination accept those seals and it's absolutely contrary serpent seed and all those other things the whole full seven mysteries is contrary to what they been taught because they took the old school from their bible school and yet in the message you have an argument that the seventh seal is not broke yet the message is split today over argument but one group saying it's open the other group said it's not open the bible said it was but it's not open to everybody because he said it'd never be open to the public simple isn't it he's right the seventh seal will never be revealed to mankind it's revealed to the bride of christ so the seal is broke to the bride and sealed to the world and yet they're split trying to split the message wide open saying whether or not the seventh seal is broke or not you see what i'm talking about organized religion this group is organized we've got to quote it's broke this group is organized it's not broken you see you don't like me to talk like that but i'm not preaching to a bunch of babies that has don't know the message of the hour you're supposed to know it i'm preaching to people that believe the message supposed to believe it see we can denominate claiming brother branham was a prophet and die man on up in the virginias will out quote me to death about brother branham and teaches it we're going to walk out in on our own ashes into the millennium because he believes we got to get a new body and you know what a lot of the people message follow it we're going to get a new body how many times did the prophet say it this body made you yet that don't mean anything to them they don't organize you see it don't take a group to be an organization just one person but that old husband's got to be dead let's stand come on musician that old husband got to be dead the old husband of organized religion of us saying we have a right to think we have no right to think whatsoever if we're sheep sheep will automatically father the shepherd right well let's just follow the shepherd and let that old denomination die brother brother you don't understand i left a denomination 50 years ago amen i left it 40 something but if anything comes into our mind that is contrary to the word of god and we don't destroy that thing it will sprout within us and we will not abide by ourselves and our thoughts we will infect everything that's around us with that virus as we call it off the computer system and we'll infect everybody with their ideas all i got to do is say mark not no that's all right all right mark no no i shouldn't even said that now i've done set in his mind something that he's going to want to know what i'm talking about well i know something that's in the church at lula but i won't tell nobody if you know something that's in lula and won't tell me get out of lula is that plain enough get out of lula why because i'm the pastor you're supposed to come tell me if you don't the blood is on your hands you're carrying blood on you if you carry a tail or an idea you see i don't do it like that i just go to people personally and say i'd like to talk to you a minute i'd like to know about this but you know then i don't go tell nobody well because i'm not supposed to right if it's under the blood we put it under the blood who's going to dig it out you dig it out you got the blood on you i just don't tell you what to do i'm sorry i guess i'm supposed to but i've never seen it solve anything a blabbering mouth is the devil's workshop organized religion is that old husband dead if not why is he still showing up every once in a while you know why is he still raising up every once in a while you know somebody hear the wife or the husband you know or be dead you say well they're dead well then you see the license plate on the car they used to drive or you see somebody seeing somebody walk in the house it looks like them something's wrong somewhere we're not dumb somebody ain't dead go ahead bro 360. 360 inspirable 360 316. 360. yeah 360. wow anybody have a need the altar is open what's killing us probably said our sin of our unbelief is gone but our sin of breathing darkness is killing us greater is he that is he that amen in the name of jesus christ we lay our hands upon our neighbors and by your stripes she's healed your word said it and we believe she believes it and thank you for taking the way lord in jesus name anybody else a power greater than a problem with congestion in his chest and think he's been sick so let's just pray and believe it lord take care of him father in the name of christ brother here lord you lay hands on jesus we ask you to just remove this problem yes what i want to see is an organism form of the bride of jesus christ around the world to be the body of christ she's going to be set free by this end time message that's what it was sent for the holy ghost had been bound for 2000 years but is to be set free by the end time nations you see yeah but look at it all around the world that ain't got nothing to do with it this message is only sent to the bride of jesus christ she's the only one can receive it because he's the only one the bride of christ that has the holy spirit if we don't have the holy spirit we can't understand the message i don't care how much we hear but brother said in the church eight book who didn't have the holy spirit he said you hear the message every day you laugh and die and go to hell it's about time to get rid of man's ideas and start believing the prophet believe what god said through a man's lips but yet people want to try to prove him wrong want to get wrong dates and wrong thoughts that you told me say it it is to be set free you're dismissed remember the service is after you father you speak with everybody but yet lord jesus greater than any earthly phone greater is he that is greater is he that is he that is
