[1:50] right now present day we know God in
[1:54] Christ born we know what the water
[1:55] baptism all about let's continue now
[1:58] with the book of Romans we're gonna have
[2:01] a little extra service today brother
[2:04] Jonas has decided the angle but now off
[2:26] that my way
[2:30] if we could break in another dimension
[2:32] there shout hey man hey man chapter six
[2:37] of the book of Romans I said we're going
[2:40] to death we're going to going to a
[2:42] funeral so the old man's got to die what
[2:46] should we say then shall we continue in
[2:47] sin that grace may abound God from it
[2:51] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[2:54] any longer therein no you not that so
[2:57] many of us as were baptized into Jesus
[2:59] Christ were baptized into his death
[3:02] therefore we are buried with him by
[3:05] baptism into death that like as Christ
[3:08] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[3:10] of the Father even so we should walk in
[3:14] newness of life we're gonna put him down
[3:15] bury him in a watery grave we're gonna
[3:18] bring them back out what the newness of
[3:22] life is for we have been planted
[3:25] together in the likeness of that if we
[3:27] have been planted we shall be also in
[3:30] the likeness of his resurrection knowing
[3:33] this that our old man is crucified with
[3:35] him that the body of sin might be
[3:37] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[3:39] serve sin or he that is dead is freed
[3:45] from sin at all times for he that is
[3:49] dead it's free from sin now if we be
[3:51] dead with Christ we believe that we
[3:53] shall also live with him knowing that
[3:57] Christ being raised from the dead dies
[3:59] no more death has no more dominion over
[4:02] him brand that he died he died into sin
[4:04] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[4:07] unto God likewise reckon ye also
[4:10] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[4:12] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
