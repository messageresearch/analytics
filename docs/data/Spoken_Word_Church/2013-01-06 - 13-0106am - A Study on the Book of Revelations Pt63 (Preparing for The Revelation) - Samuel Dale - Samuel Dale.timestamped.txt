[11:08] we may we buckle up a little closer and
[11:11] walk more into the light of your love we
[11:15] love you and we thank you we commit it
[11:17] all to you now in Jesus name
[11:21] Revelations 1
[11:24] and we'll go to Revelations 8 1.
[11:28] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[11:30] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[11:32] things which must shortly come to pass
[11:35] it's ending signified it by his Angel
[11:37] unto his servant John who by record of
[11:40] the word of God and the testimony of
[11:41] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[11:44] saw
[11:45] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[11:47] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[11:49] those things which are written that are
[11:52] in for the time is at hand Revelation 8
[11:57] 1
[11:58] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[12:00] there was silence in heaven about the
[12:03] space of half an hour you may be seated
[12:06] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[12:09] the word now to you that come up and use
[12:11] the microphones and the thing up here in
[12:14] the the center we anchored it down where
[12:18] it wouldn't be movable
[12:19] we've been turning it down and just
[12:21] breaks loose the connections that goes
[12:24] down into the to the lookup so we we're
[12:29] just leaving it we fasten it down to
[12:31] where you can bend it a little bit
[12:33] backwards and bend this and do
[12:35] everything but it doesn't bother me
[12:37] anyway maybe we get somebody short when
[12:39] we'd be all right but it doesn't bother
[12:42] me at all
[12:43] so remember that
[12:45] huh
[12:47] now
[12:48] I want to just say this
[12:52] as we're approaching this
[12:54] understanding our thoughts that we've
[12:57] been on the Book of Revelations we've
[12:59] gotten over to Revelations 8 1 and
[13:02] mayor dining and we see that there's
[13:05] silence in heaven
[13:07] about the space of half an hour
[13:10] all right then knowing that
[13:14] you know a man has tried to figure that
[13:16] out
[13:17] how many days how many minutes how much
[13:20] it'd be and
[13:21] but
[13:23] why we're trying to worry about it
[13:24] because it talks about silence in heaven
[13:26] and don't talk about anything on Earth
[13:29] Here whatsoever it says there's silence
[13:33] in heaven
[13:35] for this place of half an hour
[13:37] well see the people of the message they
[13:40] kind of figure out the idea that uh well
[13:44] we know what six of the seals are
[13:48] and uh but we don't know what the
[13:50] Sabbath is
[13:52] well that's what I've been trying to
[13:54] deal with is to express to you what I
[13:59] see the seals reveal and it's supposed
[14:03] to be the revelation of Jesus Christ all
[14:06] right now it's not supposed to be some
[14:08] man or some idea or God or whatever is
[14:12] supposed to be the revelation of Jesus
[14:14] Christ all right and in doing that then
[14:17] in breaking those things down and what
[14:20] was our thoughts of how that we saw the
[14:23] the seals
[14:26] is because that God had sent us a
[14:29] prophet right
[14:31] to express those things
[14:33] all right unto us and as he expressed
[14:36] him he told us what the the seals were
[14:39] and
[14:40] and things and uh you know
[14:44] then when you come over to the seventh
[14:47] seal
[14:49] the everybody just kind of goes Haywire
[14:51] because they don't use the same example
[14:54] as you use for each one of the seals
[14:57] because we didn't know what the first
[14:59] seal was right but we couldn't read the
[15:02] wild horse rider yeah we could do that
[15:04] I'll get back to that in a minute we
[15:05] could read those things because it's
[15:07] written in the word
[15:08] well now you can read White Horse Rider
[15:11] red horse rider black horse or a pale
[15:13] horse or you know they'll seal Jew and
[15:17] tribulation and all and all of those
[15:19] things you can read them and because of
[15:22] the Prophet bringing us the message
[15:25] and explaining those things to us
[15:29] then we can have a uh greater concept of
[15:33] what those things bring but why not use
[15:36] the same example to enter into the
[15:38] seventh seal
[15:40] of the silence in heaven we must Depend
[15:44] and that was the last message I tried to
[15:46] bring you know we must depend upon that
[15:49] God sent a prophet amen right right I
[15:52] mean we haven't come six seals and and
[15:55] depended upon God's sin and the prophet
[15:58] then get to the seventh sealed and and
[16:00] try to figure it out ourselves
[16:03] because we couldn't figure out the first
[16:05] one
[16:06] all right
[16:08] you couldn't figure out the second third
[16:11] fourth fifth sixth so why would we have
[16:13] any thoughts of trying to approach this
[16:16] outside of the same example that we use
[16:21] on each seal
[16:24] and one of the things I've emphasized is
[16:27] is the point that
[16:29] the seals
[16:31] sure they're the reveal the Plan of
[16:35] Redemption all right
[16:37] I don't know
[16:39] they're dealing with the Redemption to
[16:41] Israel as the biggest percentage of
[16:43] what's doing
[16:45] but we looked at those seals to see what
[16:47] they meant to us right in our lives
[16:52] so you thought they were going to be in
[16:54] a tribulation period no but tribulation
[16:55] work with patients
[16:58] all right so we can look back and see
[17:01] those things and realize what it has to
[17:04] do with our lives
[17:06] because that's what we need the Plan of
[17:08] Redemption and we don't need just to
[17:11] plan a Redemption for Israel right right
[17:14] that's well and good
[17:17] but we need the Plan of Redemption for
[17:19] ourselves amen because as you and I that
[17:23] are concerned with it but I hope you
[17:25] understand what I've been trying to do
[17:28] now I'll repeat it again Carter I want
[17:31] you to understand that
[17:34] if we have to depend upon the profit for
[17:36] one two three four five six
[17:39] you know
[17:40] oh the seals to bring an understanding
[17:42] to us
[17:44] then we have to depend upon him to bring
[17:47] us the understanding of the seventh seal
[17:50] all right all right then when we see
[17:52] what his understanding is
[17:56] I mean then we can see what it has to do
[17:59] with you and I
[18:01] all right so that's basically what I've
[18:04] been trying to do is cover those things
[18:06] to be able to to you know
[18:11] look at the word
[18:14] and see the word unfold right all right
[18:17] and see ourselves amen all right now
[18:21] I hope you caught one point I tried to
[18:23] make
[18:26] is we we talk about the the CEOs
[18:31] and the silence in heaven under the
[18:33] seventh seal
[18:34] well see I told you I believe that the
[18:37] first seal is silent until God revealed
[18:40] amen
[18:42] we'll find out a little later that when
[18:44] we get to it with the prophet maybe this
[18:46] afternoon that those seven Thunders
[18:50] is what's holding the revelation
[18:53] of those seals right it's not in
[18:55] addition to the book
[18:57] it's got to be in the book amen all
[19:00] right you can't do that you can't add
[19:01] two right but we have to have it
[19:05] revealed yes
[19:08] now my wife and I are talking about it
[19:10] the other day
[19:11] you know that the and I don't mean to
[19:14] say anywhere any college in the United
[19:17] States
[19:18] I know that the Oral Roberts University
[19:20] is supposed to have a copy of brother
[19:22] branham's message that's my
[19:25] understanding if they don't have it then
[19:26] I my understanding is wrong so I just
[19:29] say any college
[19:31] you know that any college any church
[19:36] any group of people
[19:39] any pastor
[19:43] they could read the Bible before the
[19:45] prophet came right right
[19:48] that's right and the seals was written
[19:50] in the book
[19:55] and they could read that
[19:58] and they had their own thoughts and
[19:59] ideas about what those things meant
[20:02] right right all right
[20:04] but we know that that didn't bring the
[20:06] revelation
[20:08] but now I don't have a seal book I just
[20:11] hold up a songbook
[20:12] but see now you could take a seal book
[20:15] but you could give it to anybody
[20:19] in the world you know their languages or
[20:21] whatever have to be considered
[20:23] but any college any church
[20:27] anywhere could read to see a book
[20:33] and explain the seals to you sure
[20:36] absolutely
[20:42] you're wanting to do it now understand
[20:43] me but I'm saying it can be done
[20:46] all right right amen see because they're
[20:48] not going to break down and do what
[20:50] somebody else but just suppose they're
[20:52] honest enough people to say well okay uh
[20:55] let's see what this man said
[20:59] they could explain the seals
[21:03] from reading the book right that's right
[21:05] they could explain the opening of the
[21:08] seals
[21:09] because of the reading of the book of
[21:11] the prophecy
[21:12] and that way they could understand the
[21:15] white horse rider
[21:16] sbnb Antichrist
[21:20] that they could take those things and
[21:23] come right down to the end
[21:26] and even quote to you the things that
[21:30] are written or the prophet of what he
[21:31] says the seventh seal is right
[21:36] he said well what's your point my point
[21:38] is one thing
[21:40] we think because we read
[21:43] we think because we have a book
[21:47] we can read a book we're blessed amen
[21:49] right amen
[21:52] but anybody can order a book that's
[21:54] right anybody can get a book
[21:57] anybody that has any education can read
[22:01] right because we read the Bible before
[22:03] the prophet
[22:04] absolutely come along amen and I told
[22:07] you the Badness used to preaching a
[22:09] little out of the Sixth Seal of the you
[22:11] know chapter six there
[22:13] because they could understand that that
[22:15] was a tribulation period
[22:17] all right
[22:20] but has it been revealed amen well
[22:23] that's it okay there's the difference
[22:26] between what I'm talking about he said
[22:28] well we've got the word
[22:31] all right right we've got the word
[22:35] we've got it in our hands
[22:38] we got the ability to read or listen to
[22:41] takes or whatever if we can't read
[22:47] we can say that we know what the seals
[22:49] are
[22:53] well you know come on am I right that's
[22:55] right those are the ability to
[22:57] have within our possession right
[23:01] we could say we know what that is
[23:04] right
[23:07] but has it been revealed to you tonight
[23:12] what do you mean that I face ministers
[23:15] in this message what do you mean reveal
[23:18] we've got the word right
[23:22] we've got the prophet's word well amen
[23:26] that said anybody could make a speech
[23:30] anybody could explain the first seal
[23:34] if we would just read the book
[23:38] and say it's not the
[23:40] Holy Spirit
[23:42] it's the Antichrist
[23:48] Clarence Larkin said that was what it
[23:50] was before brother random come along
[23:52] right
[23:55] but did that make him a prophet
[23:59] no
[24:00] he was a straddle of the horse
[24:03] right maybe or maybe it was the horse
[24:06] that's it
[24:08] Antichrist was riding on that right you
[24:11] know in other words he had to adopter
[24:13] that's right all right
[24:17] so you see then it's not revealed just
[24:19] because we read it right
[24:24] what we read and what we study on and
[24:27] meditate
[24:29] must come forth as a revelation
[24:33] all right
[24:34] see then once we do that
[24:39] see then it'll bring forth the book will
[24:42] come out we'll become open right now get
[24:45] to that this afternoon
[24:47] did we say the book is open
[24:51] but according to Revelation 10 4
[24:57] is something wrong right
[25:02] because your Prophet said it's still
[25:04] with those seven Thunder
[25:06] that's Revelation 10 14.
[25:08] 99 which verse it is
[25:12] but do we understand
[25:14] well brother Dale you just blow my mind
[25:17] could I get it just about figured out
[25:20] that I think I know what I'm talking
[25:22] about and you come along and tell me I
[25:24] don't have it well then if that tears
[25:28] you up then you know what the problem is
[25:30] you don't have it that's right amen amen
[25:34] if not you say well he just don't
[25:37] understand
[25:39] you see until it's revealed
[25:42] right
[25:43] the prophet said you can make anything
[25:45] manifest
[25:48] that's revealed to you right
[25:52] to manifest something is not what we
[25:54] look at it as and it does that because
[25:57] it deals with it the signs and wonders
[26:00] but the main word of manifestation or
[26:02] manifest is to make known
[26:07] but see then you can make known to
[26:08] somebody else what you see
[26:13] and not just a white horse rider
[26:16] you know
[26:20] all right
[26:21] look can you see that white horse rider
[26:23] riding off and you standing here because
[26:26] that's what wrote around them so
[26:28] man he said there goes that Feller that
[26:30] guy that you know on that horse riding
[26:32] off
[26:34] see peace out something related to his
[26:37] own life right
[26:40] and that's what I'm trying to do now if
[26:43] you get you and I can look at the book
[26:47] study the book study what the prophet
[26:49] has to say of course you ain't gonna go
[26:51] to Greer's Almanac right we're getting
[26:54] Jamaica and going to get a McDonald's
[26:57] we're not doing that because it won't
[27:00] fit the word
[27:02] we'll get around to it and probably said
[27:04] if somebody thinks he has those Thunders
[27:05] it must compare with every scripture in
[27:10] the Bible
[27:12] all right
[27:14] so then that's why we depend on for God
[27:17] to reveal it
[27:19] see once it's revealed you don't have no
[27:21] problem
[27:23] you mean somebody could caulk you out
[27:25] your understanding of one God
[27:29] if they can this that's all you've got
[27:31] all right that's right you don't have a
[27:35] revelation you just got to understand it
[27:37] right that's right
[27:39] all right then I thought the Holy Ghost
[27:42] was the revealer of the word amen
[27:45] I didn't know no man could reveal it
[27:48] right I know a prophet is one who
[27:51] reveals the word of God
[27:54] and even the prophet said about him as
[27:57] to be one that is
[27:59] he reveals the part that's in his own
[28:01] life right all right
[28:04] but we know that Jesus couldn't reveal
[28:06] the word
[28:10] right
[28:12] around
[28:15] him and that's what I made an emphasis
[28:17] over and over all these 40 something
[28:18] years
[28:19] then we talk about the seventh she'll
[28:21] not even be written
[28:25] yeah we got the quote
[28:28] let's see then you mean to tell me that
[28:31] brother Brown could tell us something
[28:32] that Jesus couldn't tell us
[28:34] that's right
[28:36] that the Bible couldn't tell us
[28:41] so it's got to be in the word amen right
[28:51] so now we can read Revelation day one
[28:56] it's written in the word
[28:59] so now we don't have to worry about it
[29:00] the seven seal is in the word right
[29:05] right it's written in the word right
[29:07] right we could open the seven seal every
[29:09] silence in heaven
[29:17] because when we read Revelations
[29:20] six one it says that the lamb broke the
[29:24] first seal right
[29:26] and it was a wild horse rider rolled off
[29:30] well we could read it because it's
[29:32] written in the book
[29:34] right right
[29:36] but what we needed was to know what that
[29:39] was
[29:40] being said
[29:45] until then we we go to the prophet
[29:49] and we read what the prophet said amen
[29:53] and he explained to one horse rider and
[29:55] we can say well thank you Lord
[29:58] right but has it been revealed
[30:06] now wouldn't it be something for
[30:10] us to be sitting in a
[30:13] any kind of Church Catholic Baptist
[30:16] Methodist Presbyterian
[30:18] and say I believe them seals
[30:24] you know I believe that one more
[30:26] surrounded that Prophet told us that
[30:30] see the thing of behind the seal
[30:34] is to see where that white horse rider
[30:36] came from right and you'd find out it
[30:39] come from organized religion amen
[30:41] well now how can you stay there
[30:45] amen come on how can you stay there
[30:48] in organized religion and say you
[30:51] believe the word that's right that's
[30:53] right amen yeah well I believe what the
[30:56] prophet said that only makes sense right
[31:00] God if you believe it you couldn't go
[31:02] right
[31:03] Karen they're secret believers they were
[31:06] secret Believers in the days of the Lord
[31:07] Jesus that's right
[31:09] but them secret Believers didn't amount
[31:11] to much
[31:12] that's right it was when they came out
[31:14] into the open and professed or confessed
[31:17] their belief
[31:22] that's when the world went after him
[31:27] but see how can we send in this message
[31:34] and say we believe the prophet's message
[31:38] and people will sit in churches that are
[31:41] teaching that he was wrong
[31:43] right
[31:44] right right sure how could you do that
[31:51] well I don't have nowhere else to go
[31:55] you can always move
[31:57] that's right no I can't well you think
[32:01] more of where you're at than you do to
[32:03] move right come on be sensible all right
[32:11] you know years ago some here tried to
[32:13] get me to
[32:15] get a church down Atlanta
[32:22] they said that way the biggest portion
[32:23] of the people will be right around the
[32:25] church
[32:26] I said you ain't got but one problem
[32:30] I said you're dealing with an old goat
[32:34] that's going to make you decide what you
[32:37] want to do
[32:44] so you're gonna drive up here if you're
[32:46] going to hear
[32:48] because at least you'll have to make an
[32:49] effort
[32:50] you said well brother Dale that was kind
[32:53] of bad on you wasn't it
[32:56] might be
[32:58] but at least you proved you know if you
[33:02] were willing to drive
[33:04] just getting the point right
[33:06] instead of me driving to you you're
[33:08] willing to drive here
[33:10] because it wouldn't matter to me if this
[33:12] church was in Washington DC
[33:14] as long as we could get turned back yeah
[33:16] right right and whatever
[33:20] but you see God wants you and I to put
[33:23] forth an effort and we do that to travel
[33:26] and do things wow now get on with it
[33:31] but Stephen we come into the message
[33:36] and we we find so many different
[33:39] Avenues of going
[33:41] of the people of the message
[33:44] and they all claim to believe one
[33:46] message
[33:47] that's right
[33:50] but then they can straighten him out and
[33:52] correct him and all kind of things
[33:55] now I'm not going to get up here and
[33:57] tell you brother Brown was a prophet a
[33:59] mouthpiece of God
[34:01] and tell you how I'm corrected right now
[34:05] I got very little education but I got
[34:08] some sense you know that don't take
[34:11] education to be that you can be a dummy
[34:14] and have a photographic memory
[34:17] but I call a dummy is somebody that
[34:19] won't take correction for the word amen
[34:22] but you get what I'm talking about now
[34:24] I'm just trying to make a point
[34:26] because this is what I've been driving
[34:27] at
[34:30] see if we depend upon what he said for
[34:33] one two three four five six
[34:36] then the only way
[34:39] that we could come out with a sensual
[34:43] understanding
[34:45] is to approach the seventh seal as from
[34:48] what he said
[34:49] okay
[34:52] and he told us a lot of the things that
[34:54] the seventh sea level yes
[34:57] yes but neither one of them has added to
[34:59] the word that I've ever found
[35:03] and none of he said has added to the
[35:05] word
[35:05] because he always put us back in the
[35:07] word
[35:11] they said to him one day he said well
[35:14] brother random said you know with your
[35:15] ability you could write a 23rd chapter
[35:17] of Revelation
[35:18] he said he's trying to trap me for one
[35:20] thing and he said but
[35:23] so I told him so when I can't be done
[35:25] you can't add to the word right he said
[35:28] well what about them seven Thunders
[35:30] won't that be given to somebody
[35:35] he said no because you'd be adding to
[35:38] the word
[35:40] so the seven Thunders can't add to the
[35:42] word of God that's right amen
[35:48] it has to be in the word
[35:51] but something that light is not shined
[35:53] on because wasn't that the way that he
[35:55] approached the seals in the dream that
[35:58] somebody had of seeing the pyramid
[36:00] Mountain you know and it was
[36:02] interpreting that with your statue of
[36:04] perfect man and he was interpreting
[36:06] those things that were written and
[36:08] whipped off the top you know looked down
[36:09] in and I was the Seven Seals
[36:13] it's got to be in the word don't you
[36:16] ever get any thought about brother Dale
[36:18] saying that the one C or a seventh seal
[36:20] or any seal is not in the word of God
[36:22] that's right amen
[36:25] because you'd be adding two
[36:28] you know
[36:29] you know you could come out with like
[36:33] um Brother Gary I hope don't mind it
[36:35] but we were sitting in Rhymes one day I
[36:37] think it was eating I told you this
[36:39] before and Sister Margaret was sitting
[36:41] there and brother Gary was talking about
[36:43] all these people think that that
[36:45] polygamy is the great revelation of the
[36:47] seventh seal
[36:48] it's just a market she never did save
[36:50] her much you know talking but she made a
[36:54] good point she said if he can get that
[36:55] Revelation to polygamy you know get more
[36:58] wives and things the seventh see if I
[37:00] can get the Revelation I take my 357
[37:02] blow his head off
[37:05] and I said sister I agree with you
[37:09] because it can you can get it to be one
[37:11] thing I can get it to be another that's
[37:13] right that's right but if we're going to
[37:15] depend upon the profit amen right to
[37:18] tell us all right now we're going to go
[37:21] through this
[37:23] I've been trying to get across you when
[37:25] you have company it's hard to just talk
[37:27] to people you know with company and
[37:30] different things and but see the
[37:33] approach we want to take is exactly the
[37:35] approach we've been taking
[37:38] that we must depend upon the profit to
[37:40] bring the Revelation amen all right then
[37:42] we must see what those things are under
[37:45] there under the seals
[37:48] no matter what number it is
[37:50] and then from that we must ask God to
[37:55] reveal it right because the letter of
[37:58] the page is not the revelation it cannot
[38:02] be
[38:03] contrary to the letter that's right
[38:06] right that's right there's no Revelation
[38:08] whatsoever can be contrary to the letter
[38:10] of the word you talk about written
[38:13] between the lines all you want to that's
[38:15] right but do you better have what's in
[38:16] between the lines better line up with
[38:18] what's on the line amen that's right
[38:20] amen the only thing brought around we're
[38:22] talking about in between the lines would
[38:23] like you can't read that Abraham and
[38:25] Sarah was turned back to a young man to
[38:27] young woman yes
[38:28] would you read between the lines and see
[38:31] that she went down there
[38:32] you know
[38:35] 100 year old grandma or something you
[38:37] know and the King wants to marry her
[38:39] that's the things that are written
[38:41] between the word that's right letter you
[38:42] know amen but he can't be contrary to
[38:45] the letter
[38:47] she couldn't go down there as somebody
[38:49] else's wife
[38:51] the letter said she was Abraham right
[38:54] let's see that's what I've been trying
[38:56] to approach and then then from that
[38:59] yeah
[39:01] let God speak to our lives right
[39:08] amen and to see what it has to do with
[39:09] us
[39:11] even though it may not pertain to us
[39:13] physically you know
[39:18] but yet we can look at it and see what
[39:20] it's speaking to our hearts and Minds
[39:22] because it is the Plan of Redemption I
[39:24] hope that that's been established amen
[39:29] that the Book of Revelations explaining
[39:31] the Plan of Redemption right
[39:34] all the seals are explaining the Plan of
[39:37] Redemption that's right now I've told
[39:39] you now I will get to it later
[39:41] I don't believe the seventh seal brings
[39:43] out a point of something short as
[39:45] redeemed because
[39:47] you know that way you can take it into
[39:50] the new birth and that's fine
[39:52] but the main thing to me about the
[39:54] seventh seal is
[39:55] if we'll get to it maybe this afternoon
[39:58] or next year one
[40:00] when we talk about it being his coming
[40:04] but the prophet said that's what it was
[40:06] then we're going to have to realize that
[40:08] coming has got to be to you and I think
[40:10] right
[40:13] and if it's to you and I then
[40:16] we've got to see our part about the
[40:18] Coney
[40:23] and then the prophet would come up to
[40:25] say
[40:27] he comes back after her
[40:32] do we know what to look for
[40:35] you remember the prophet one day said
[40:37] you know what to look for
[40:40] I pondered out a long time ago I didn't
[40:41] know what to look for
[40:45] but now we see that we need to look for
[40:47] the coming of the Lord to you and I
[40:49] right not the coming of the Lord to the
[40:51] world not to come to the Lord to anybody
[40:52] else right oh if we could just begin oh
[40:56] brother or sister so it's so
[40:57] straightened up we'd be ready to go no
[40:59] no no it's a personal matter
[41:04] but see he's going to come back is for
[41:06] us right
[41:08] so that's the part we need to understand
[41:10] all right
[41:12] but now
[41:14] it was not until the prophet spoke to us
[41:18] could we understand anything
[41:23] that's why I said and I made the
[41:25] statement
[41:27] that there's silence in heaven
[41:31] over what happened two thousand years
[41:32] ago in glory
[41:34] right right and until those seals are
[41:36] revealed it's still silent all right
[41:39] amen to a person that does not
[41:41] understand the seals by Revelation the
[41:44] seals are not broke thank you man that's
[41:46] right
[41:47] that's sensible
[41:50] what we need is a revelation right more
[41:53] than anything else
[41:54] all right now let's start see if we can
[41:56] get a little bit
[42:00] on the end of what we're trying to to
[42:03] cover
[42:06] now we read here that silence in heaven
[42:11] all right now
[42:13] listen to what I'm saying
[42:15] this tells me
[42:17] just as much as to read over here
[42:24] himself lamb wrote out you know I mean a
[42:28] a writer wrote out a white horse rider
[42:31] once that symbol is broken
[42:36] then I can see
[42:37] that Antichrist right right
[42:40] all right let's see this this over here
[42:43] is written just like that's written
[42:45] right
[42:47] we're gonna do it in a second it
[42:49] requires then that a prophet be here
[42:52] that's right so tell us what that means
[42:56] all right
[42:59] but now I hope you don't you don't get
[43:01] tired of me saying the same thing over
[43:02] again but this Prophet can't add to the
[43:04] word right
[43:08] right it's got to be what's in the word
[43:10] amen I believe it
[43:12] but as I said about whipping off the top
[43:14] of the period looking down here there
[43:15] was things in there that hadn't been
[43:17] lighted not shined on
[43:22] and then listen
[43:25] we found they were silence in heaven
[43:30] the angel stop Jeremy and stopped
[43:34] everything stopped
[43:36] why
[43:40] because it might give away the secret
[43:46] what was the secret
[43:48] The Secret of redemption amen amen what
[43:52] else is to be revealed that's right
[43:55] certainly it's not the White Horse
[43:57] rather be in the Antichrist that's what
[43:58] everybody said you said what's the first
[44:00] seal modern horse rider Antichrist
[44:04] no
[44:06] more Roberts University could tell you
[44:07] that in what page or something right
[44:10] yep
[44:14] that's right
[44:17] see that you understand my point of
[44:19] water bring it out while ago anybody can
[44:21] take the seal book
[44:23] and just read it and make a speech about
[44:26] it
[44:29] and say I told you just what the prophet
[44:33] said right
[44:36] see we need a revelation
[44:41] now
[44:42] I'm going to stay on this if I have to
[44:44] there's a whole message for you and I'll
[44:46] go to
[44:47] my notes in the evening
[44:52] Satan
[44:54] can read the book
[44:57] that's right
[44:59] he knows what the Blair says
[45:03] he knows what brother random taught
[45:08] he's got a photographic memory right
[45:12] that's right amen you know
[45:16] you ask him what did the problem first
[45:19] dealership white horse rider and cry
[45:24] see you asked the bad this message this
[45:26] Presbyterian what is that I don't know
[45:31] why because they've never had the silver
[45:33] broken right but you ask Satan I ain't
[45:36] gonna call him I spend more time talking
[45:38] to him I knew the Lord too just argue
[45:40] about how you won't do
[45:42] because you do too you want to admit it
[45:46] but see the devil you asked the devil
[45:49] today said what's the first seal he said
[45:52] well I was right
[45:56] well that used to be told it was the
[45:58] Holy Spirit he said no we know better
[45:59] now
[46:01] right well what is it it's the
[46:05] Antichrist right
[46:08] yeah she could tell you every letter of
[46:11] the word
[46:15] does that mean it's revealed to him yeah
[46:24] right right and even got born again it
[46:26] would be the devil no more
[46:32] I'm really sorry for him because he
[46:33] cannot be born again
[46:35] right here
[46:38] what are you listening yes yes amen see
[46:41] the devil can tell you everything right
[46:44] around him say it
[46:47] now
[46:48] back when it was in the days of the Lord
[46:50] Jesus
[46:53] turn these down with the bread you know
[46:56] get not the Lord thy God you know
[47:00] he only answered carnal
[47:02] things right right
[47:06] Ernest only bread
[47:09] I believe you can do it go ahead and
[47:10] turn these stones into bread
[47:13] it's something natural right
[47:16] but see he's not that dumb no more
[47:21] I tears him up but sorry to say anything
[47:24] it's not that dumb no more
[47:26] now according to the Bible
[47:32] Satan has
[47:34] Ministers of righteousness
[47:37] preachers that's right I scored the
[47:40] Bible
[47:42] and see a right a person that believes
[47:45] in righteousness is not a law teacher
[47:48] I'm trying to illustrate see he's
[47:50] getting away from the natural letter
[47:52] when he approached Jesus it was natural
[47:54] letter turn this to bread do this do
[47:56] that do
[47:58] see not anymore right
[48:03] the brother told me one time he said
[48:04] brother now be careful said the devil
[48:06] will hear you say that I said the devil
[48:08] heard right around saying right
[48:12] no problem he heard him say it that's
[48:15] right
[48:18] all right
[48:21] we think that we have but but if it's
[48:24] not revealed we have no more than what
[48:26] he had right right
[48:30] see then we can be swayed by greater
[48:33] matter when you're arguments or you know
[48:37] people talking and doing
[48:40] but now listen
[48:45] we read the things that Prophet had to
[48:47] say
[48:50] just like I've always challenged you of
[48:52] one thing you need to read and read and
[48:53] read and study and ask God to reveal
[48:57] because you give me anything brother
[48:59] random talk anything he said and
[49:02] probably by my memory I can give you a
[49:04] quote contrary to it
[49:06] you agree
[49:09] now you know brother random we'll get
[49:11] back to it in a little bit you know run
[49:12] around and talk it over and over you
[49:13] can't add to the Bible right
[49:16] he says here he's talking about the
[49:18] seventh seal he said it's not even
[49:19] written in the word
[49:24] oh wait think about that
[49:28] now if it's not written in the word and
[49:29] he tells you what it is that's an
[49:31] addition to the word right have you got
[49:32] you understand what I'm getting in all
[49:34] right
[49:35] if it's not written then he tells you
[49:37] what it is he added
[49:39] right
[49:41] but if it's in the word
[49:46] and you he gives you his revelation
[49:52] then it can be revealed to you right
[49:56] and you can have a revelation amen
[50:01] right now you hadn't added to the word
[50:02] at all
[50:03] right
[50:05] amen
[50:09] I heard a man one time said he his way
[50:11] back said he he was talking about law
[50:13] and Grace
[50:15] he said he went to lift one man and he
[50:17] heard it was really on on Grace and said
[50:20] boy he went Garden
[50:22] we've got tapes or whatever he done you
[50:24] know and he listened and he said they
[50:26] just ain't no way anybody could explain
[50:28] that any other way
[50:29] that's what it is
[50:33] he heard another man that spoke on the
[50:35] contrary part of
[50:36] law
[50:38] from trying to take like James going one
[50:41] way you don't call another we know he
[50:42] didn't but to try to take that because
[50:44] this was organizational people
[50:47] he said I listened to the other man
[50:50] and he said I was vastly confused
[50:54] he said because that man laid it down in
[50:56] a line that I couldn't argue with what
[50:59] he said
[51:01] so now there you're standing with one
[51:03] side going one way and one side going
[51:05] the other way what are you gonna do
[51:06] right
[51:10] well I'm just gonna stay in the middle
[51:14] be careful because it's kind of sharp in
[51:16] the middle you know kind of a peak right
[51:19] and all you got to do is lean just a
[51:20] little bit and you're going off and I'm
[51:22] just
[51:23] but you see there's only one thing that
[51:25] could take law and Grace and put it
[51:26] together and that's a revelation from
[51:28] God
[51:30] our intellect cannot do it amen right
[51:32] don't anybody else can argue the point
[51:34] right
[51:36] all right
[51:37] but listen
[51:40] go ahead and pull up number one on there
[51:42] paragraph 249 on the seventh seal
[51:49] and look what he says
[51:54] now why let us prove it one
[51:58] it is the secret that no one knows about
[52:01] yarn was forbidden to write about it
[52:06] even write a symbol about it
[52:09] come on
[52:12] this is why there was no activity in no
[52:15] acting in heaven activity in heaven it
[52:19] might give away the secret
[52:21] it's not
[52:23] appreciate it man
[52:25] it might give away the secret
[52:29] so if it's part of the Plan of
[52:31] Redemption
[52:34] you're dealing with Redemption right
[52:40] now listen plain language I like to put
[52:43] it this way
[52:44] they used to think that the seven
[52:46] Thunders with seven men that had each
[52:48] one had a thunder
[52:50] all right
[52:52] so you probably heard about those things
[52:56] but
[52:58] that would put it to where you could
[53:00] find
[53:06] that would make it something that the
[53:09] book is not making or the writing of it
[53:12] it'd be hard to keep a secret if you had
[53:15] seven names and seven people standing
[53:17] there
[53:21] because each one of those men were
[53:22] supposed to have a great Revelation to
[53:24] bring to us you know
[53:28] but he said he might give away the
[53:29] secret
[53:33] right
[53:34] another group of people around the
[53:36] message
[53:37] says the seventh seal is not broken
[53:41] they have quotes
[53:46] they said nobody can understand that
[53:48] seventh seal
[53:51] the prophet's got to come back
[53:58] and tell us what it is
[54:03] that's another group complete
[54:05] there's a slow groups of people that try
[54:08] to interpret that seventh seal but read
[54:10] it in simple language
[54:11] you might give away the secret
[54:17] welcome brother there's nothing there
[54:21] no that's not what your Prophet said
[54:27] that's right he said there's nothing
[54:29] written huh we'll go along on that
[54:34] but I wish you'd read the rest of that
[54:36] paragraph right in front of you
[54:42] it's so great it must be included
[54:49] no it's going to be included
[54:52] because it's got to happen
[54:57] so it's got to be included in your
[55:00] Revelation or you don't have a full
[55:02] Revelation and it's got to happen
[55:07] do we say the seven seal can't be
[55:09] revealed of nobody
[55:10] well now
[55:12] it's got to be included that's what your
[55:15] prophets is right and it's got to happen
[55:18] hmm
[55:20] all right so everybody's got a way of
[55:24] trying to interpret that right
[55:27] run down to the bottom
[55:32] if Satan should get a hold of it he
[55:34] might do great damage
[55:36] there's one thing he don't know
[55:39] now he can interpret anything he wants
[55:42] to now let's see it and impersonate
[55:46] any kind of a gift
[55:49] now come on if he can impersonate a gift
[55:52] right then as I said while ago the Bible
[55:54] says that Satan's got Ministers of
[55:57] righteousness amen
[56:01] to deceive with
[56:07] it brother Rob said he can give out
[56:08] Supernatural gifts all day long
[56:12] now you argue with him about it I'm just
[56:13] telling you what he's saying
[56:16] see when you say I don't see that I
[56:18] can't believe well then you're arguing
[56:20] he ain't arguing with me yes that's
[56:21] right why get mad at me because I found
[56:24] a quote
[56:28] he said I hope you learn
[56:31] but he can't know this but
[56:33] he's not even written in the word
[56:37] it's a total Secret
[56:40] the Angels everything shut up
[56:42] if they made one move it might heal
[56:44] something away so they just shut up quit
[56:47] harping everything stopped
[56:51] what I said a moment ago we have to tell
[56:53] you that wait a minute
[56:56] you can't add through the word
[56:58] right
[57:00] but there's nothing written
[57:04] it's the phrase there's silence in
[57:06] heaven
[57:11] now
[57:12] all we need to know is get a profit
[57:16] and depend upon him to tell us what that
[57:18] is
[57:19] right
[57:20] and totally depend upon him not not you
[57:24] know not something we do
[57:28] that we're
[57:31] we agree on one thing we'll agree six
[57:34] and seals is broke
[57:37] but won't agree on the seventh being
[57:39] broke or open you're doing what you want
[57:41] to say
[57:43] then your Prophet said you're only
[57:45] presuming right that's right
[57:54] to eventually without Authority so
[57:55] you're standing on the shaky legs
[57:58] look what he says paragraph number two
[58:00] there's another paragraph 48.
[58:04] and notice the Seven Seals hold Seven
[58:08] Seals holds the mystery of the book
[58:12] until we can see what those Seven Seals
[58:15] have sealed in
[58:17] we're only presuming them things
[58:21] that's the breach
[58:24] so he knew
[58:27] when he started
[58:31] that there would be a great connection
[58:34] and all of the seals would have to be
[58:36] revealed or you'd be presuming yep right
[58:41] well no no brother he just meant six
[58:43] seals well then he didn't say that
[58:46] right he said Seven Seals to be revealed
[58:50] all right go to the next one which is in
[58:52] the breach prayer 68.
[58:55] well that word Redemption
[58:59] until the day that the book of
[59:02] redemption has been revealed
[59:04] and a redeemer
[59:07] Redeemer nothing can do it
[59:09] don't grieve it they do do things that
[59:12] pleases God but the book is sealed now
[59:15] and you are sealed
[59:18] you don't hear that a lot tying together
[59:20] with the seals do you yep the holy
[59:23] spirit is the seal still signified in
[59:25] other words I got from dictionary it
[59:27] still signifies the finished work
[59:28] and when the seventh seal still be
[59:31] broken
[59:33] seventh seventh seal is broken the
[59:37] mystery of God that's sealed in these
[59:39] mystery mysterious seals is finished
[59:42] until the day that seal is broken
[59:47] then it's revealed what's on the inside
[59:48] of it
[59:50] if the man's wondering what's in the
[59:52] carbox you say it's supposed to be such
[59:54] and such that's supposed to be
[59:56] he's presuming
[59:58] but when the steel is broken and the
[1:00:00] door is open we see and do it then and
[1:00:03] see exactly what's there
[1:00:05] hey
[1:00:06] but I'll be done at the end time right
[1:00:09] presuming
[1:00:11] because you say I understand six of them
[1:00:13] don't understand the sound like you're
[1:00:15] presuming
[1:00:17] what about a prophet
[1:00:20] that would come through the seals and
[1:00:21] bring it out as the thus saith the Lord
[1:00:24] did you do that did you bring each seal
[1:00:26] as he may not use the words but they're
[1:00:29] there right that this is thus they have
[1:00:31] the Lord straight from God right right
[1:00:33] right
[1:00:33] amen and what about a thus saith the
[1:00:36] Lord but you're only presuming
[1:00:41] I don't make sense dude
[1:00:44] your Revelation don't never make sense
[1:00:49] sorry a revelation ain't never sensible
[1:00:52] but once it's revealed it's the only
[1:00:54] thing that is sensible right right
[1:00:56] but when you first looking at it there's
[1:00:58] nothing sensible about a revelation
[1:01:01] it's contrary
[1:01:02] what do you mean well we know even even
[1:01:05] that'll be the Apple it says it ain't
[1:01:08] the forbidden fruit
[1:01:11] you're saying it was sex so you're
[1:01:13] making them pervert
[1:01:16] or had those things so do you think
[1:01:19] but
[1:01:22] thanks
[1:01:24] but you're only presuming right
[1:01:28] and remember the book is sealed
[1:01:31] that's right and you're sealed with the
[1:01:33] book
[1:01:35] that's right
[1:01:37] we better want to know what the Plan of
[1:01:39] Redemption is yes God is that on the way
[1:01:45] that we can be redeemed amen right
[1:01:50] this is not going to church and being
[1:01:52] good that's right
[1:01:55] this is not those things
[1:01:58] but you're only presuming
[1:02:00] until the end time
[1:02:03] that's what he said yep right
[1:02:06] join the end time
[1:02:10] the Revelation comes forth
[1:02:13] what about those great men of the
[1:02:14] Apostle Paul and
[1:02:16] those writings and
[1:02:21] and yet without the opening of the seals
[1:02:26] you're standing with thus saith the Lord
[1:02:28] with no way to make it manifest
[1:02:31] yeah come on
[1:02:35] nowhere to bring it out and make it
[1:02:37] benefit
[1:02:39] that's why everybody's waiting on you
[1:02:40] and I
[1:02:42] right right amen
[1:02:45] everything's dependent upon you and I
[1:02:50] amen
[1:02:52] because
[1:02:53] if we don't come for it
[1:02:56] in a resurrection in a change in a
[1:02:59] sentient Rapture Etc
[1:03:01] then nobody goes to heaven that's right
[1:03:07] that's all totally dependent upon you
[1:03:09] and I all right
[1:03:13] well I'll tell you what I'd like to live
[1:03:15] out there right that's fine I would have
[1:03:17] too I'd love to bend my car but I'd
[1:03:19] rather be here right right
[1:03:22] well because we're down here in the NW
[1:03:25] but you see
[1:03:27] you're only presuming
[1:03:31] until the seventh seal comes forward
[1:03:34] right
[1:03:36] now
[1:03:38] we know for a certainty that's why I
[1:03:41] love it that way
[1:03:45] honey
[1:03:46] remember to stand here and say without
[1:03:49] the opening of the seventh seal we're
[1:03:50] only presuming about the other things
[1:03:52] because the prophet had to say it
[1:03:54] but then it's the same way I can stand
[1:03:56] here and say
[1:03:59] according to the Bible
[1:04:01] according to the prophet the seventh
[1:04:03] seal was broke
[1:04:05] now whether or not we know what it is
[1:04:07] that's that's irrelevant to the
[1:04:09] situation never went through a big old
[1:04:11] words are Don't Mean a Thing
[1:04:16] but since the seventh seal is broken
[1:04:18] then I'm not presuming right rightwise
[1:04:21] right
[1:04:26] what about a great revelation of all
[1:04:28] down through there and they're dependent
[1:04:30] upon you and I to get to the place that
[1:04:32] we say we're not presuming right
[1:04:35] yeah I don't like that people get
[1:04:37] together we get in these meetings and
[1:04:38] things well what's your input
[1:04:41] that turns me to smithereens
[1:04:47] I'd rather you get up and tell me that
[1:04:50] you believe your big toe is God and I
[1:04:52] gotta kiss it to go to heaven
[1:04:54] let me say what's your input
[1:05:02] when you say an input you
[1:05:07] mean
[1:05:10] when you say this is why it stands
[1:05:15] and if you're right you're not presuming
[1:05:17] anymore
[1:05:19] you remember the Irish scripture where
[1:05:21] it says I believe it was Peter said this
[1:05:23] is that
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:27] now he wasn't presuming was he
[1:05:29] he had the goods and he said this is
[1:05:33] that
[1:05:34] they were spoken up by the prophets
[1:05:37] see we got to have it that way church
[1:05:39] and we're going to be in bad shape
[1:05:42] but see around the message they say the
[1:05:43] sentiment sealed is not broke
[1:05:47] well we read it and ate one it said
[1:05:50] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:05:54] right so the lamb that opened the first
[1:05:57] one opened the seven right
[1:05:59] all right
[1:06:01] we want people more to say as far as I'm
[1:06:03] concerned they would do that
[1:06:09] you didn't jump right up in your face
[1:06:12] hmm
[1:06:14] oh that's what the interface shouldn't
[1:06:16] say you think you know what the seven
[1:06:17] seal you know them Thunders tell me the
[1:06:19] new name of Jesus
[1:06:24] Christ be revealed in the Thunder
[1:06:29] we don't have to thinking about that the
[1:06:31] other day and
[1:06:40] I'm going to tell you the new name of
[1:06:42] Jesus
[1:06:45] now I can't leave Jesus
[1:06:48] right right
[1:06:51] are you listening yeah
[1:06:54] I'm just thinking no more you know how
[1:06:56] dumb we want to be
[1:06:57] if it's the new name of Jesus if you
[1:07:01] said the name of God
[1:07:03] to be revealed in the end time or
[1:07:04] something
[1:07:06] you could not connect it to Jesus
[1:07:10] but if it's a new name of Jesus
[1:07:14] now I'm going to tell you the new name
[1:07:16] of waydale
[1:07:19] there's no way in the world I can do
[1:07:20] away with his name
[1:07:22] right
[1:07:24] but he used to call him at school one
[1:07:27] one
[1:07:31] day the new name
[1:07:33] well that means I've got I've got to
[1:07:35] have late deal
[1:07:38] standing there or I'm telling you the
[1:07:41] new name of somebody else because you
[1:07:43] don't know who I'm talking about
[1:07:45] right and I'll go thank you Lord
[1:07:48] it's all right may not mean nothing to
[1:07:50] you let me go off to me Hallelujah if we
[1:07:54] need to know the new name of Jesus that
[1:07:55] means we can't leave Jesus out
[1:07:57] right
[1:08:01] okay
[1:08:03] I ain't worried about it
[1:08:06] probably shouldn't be made known it
[1:08:08] would be made known when we get there or
[1:08:10] whenever right whatever it is don't
[1:08:12] worry about it amen
[1:08:14] but now listen we read in the scripture
[1:08:18] let the Sabbath seal is broke right amen
[1:08:21] all right now go ahead with number four
[1:08:23] on the notes which is seven see in
[1:08:25] paragraph 241.
[1:08:26] he said win this seventh seal mystery
[1:08:29] in the book of redemption was broke open
[1:08:32] think of it but it's broke the lamb
[1:08:35] breaks it
[1:08:36] you know what they were all right I
[1:08:38] believe
[1:08:39] they didn't know all means you've come
[1:08:41] to a holy reverence of respect
[1:08:46] and you're standing all
[1:08:49] right but he says this bro
[1:08:51] but brother there you don't know over
[1:08:53] here this quote okay I'll be glad to
[1:08:55] give it to you but run around and said
[1:08:57] to seven see I'm not broke yet right
[1:09:02] it says it can't be made known to the
[1:09:04] public
[1:09:06] I could walk a little bit
[1:09:09] me
[1:09:11] but for you to say it's not broke you're
[1:09:13] a liar right amen
[1:09:15] of course the Bible says it the prophet
[1:09:18] says amen now to say you don't know what
[1:09:21] it is is the truth right right
[1:09:24] we know what it was we wouldn't say it
[1:09:28] wasn't broke
[1:09:32] because if we know what it is it's got
[1:09:34] to be broke
[1:09:36] I don't need a revelation does it that's
[1:09:38] right
[1:09:39] you can't get a revelation of something
[1:09:41] that ain't
[1:09:43] right I'm glad they finally put that in
[1:09:45] the dictionary
[1:09:47] the word ain't
[1:09:49] or I can use it
[1:09:51] all right
[1:09:54] but you see then it's got to be broke
[1:09:57] it's not whether or not we're dealing
[1:09:59] with words
[1:10:02] right I mean I had somebody you know
[1:10:06] that ain't in the message or book let's
[1:10:08] say would you mind reading that and
[1:10:09] they'd say well in the Sabbath see it
[1:10:12] was broke
[1:10:13] would you mind reading this quote from a
[1:10:15] man and see the Earth the seals broke
[1:10:21] all right that's it well what does that
[1:10:23] mean
[1:10:24] he said whatever what it was it got
[1:10:26] broke
[1:10:27] some way because it's open
[1:10:30] right
[1:10:31] you see no no no we're not supposed to
[1:10:33] reason things out brother Dale the Bible
[1:10:36] says come let us reason together right
[1:10:40] the Bible's the only thing that is
[1:10:42] reasonable amen
[1:10:45] now
[1:10:47] let's take this a little bit into
[1:10:48] something
[1:10:52] and just consider the point I'll give
[1:10:53] you these quotes before and we've been
[1:10:54] over them but I want to bring it down a
[1:10:57] little they're going to number five
[1:10:59] yeah
[1:11:00] hurry
[1:11:04] jump up to number six before you do
[1:11:06] number five
[1:11:07] option number six let's read it first
[1:11:12] this is question and answered on the
[1:11:14] seals
[1:11:16] he's talking about there's got to be a
[1:11:17] messenger not open to see it for us
[1:11:19] what's the first that first there's a
[1:11:21] messenger church next to see we find out
[1:11:23] the corruption that hits in the cemetery
[1:11:25] but the seventh seal doesn't reveal
[1:11:28] anything what's going to happen to it
[1:11:30] see
[1:11:32] one
[1:11:34] because at the end of that church Aid is
[1:11:37] to come a prophetic gift
[1:11:41] to reveal these things see are you
[1:11:43] father
[1:11:48] I wouldn't know the number or paragraph
[1:11:50] but you should know when it's in the
[1:11:52] seal book
[1:11:57] and when he says the seventh seal
[1:11:59] doesn't reveal
[1:12:00] anything what's going to happen you go
[1:12:03] to the end of the church that he's just
[1:12:05] become a prophetic gift
[1:12:07] I thought when we came through the seals
[1:12:10] and we got over to number five
[1:12:14] that the prophet covers emphatically
[1:12:18] that there's no need
[1:12:21] of a combat Beast
[1:12:25] right you remember that
[1:12:28] man you got your line me off the man the
[1:12:30] eagle the life is an eagle there's no
[1:12:32] need of another combat beats why because
[1:12:34] that was the seventh Church age
[1:12:35] Messenger right right seventh Angels
[1:12:38] seven thirteen manager right well see we
[1:12:41] don't need
[1:12:42] somebody
[1:12:44] to explain the field six and seventh
[1:12:46] seal to us why because the prophet is
[1:12:49] here to tell us what it is and there's
[1:12:52] no way anybody can explain it to us
[1:12:55] and the prophet can only give you his
[1:12:59] Revelation right he is revelation he
[1:13:05] can't give you a revelation and make him
[1:13:07] almighty God right
[1:13:11] so then we found out that there's no
[1:13:13] need of a combat beast on the fifth
[1:13:15] sixth and seventh seal why
[1:13:18] because it was a prophet
[1:13:22] a prophetic gifts to come down amen
[1:13:25] a prophet to explain these things to us
[1:13:30] right right
[1:13:31] so when we're done to the Sabbath we're
[1:13:33] standing just as we
[1:13:36] not if we didn't have to stand there on
[1:13:39] the one two three four but
[1:13:42] to get down to explaining it see we've
[1:13:44] got to have the prophet Messenger right
[1:13:49] so then whatever his Revelation is
[1:13:54] right
[1:13:56] that's the only thing me and you've got
[1:13:58] to go on
[1:14:02] if we go on our own Revelation right we
[1:14:06] sure have goofed it up amen right
[1:14:08] because we was goofed up I don't care
[1:14:11] who you are yes right that's right and
[1:14:14] what you claim
[1:14:16] the prophet is the one the word of God
[1:14:19] comes to amen now if you can straighten
[1:14:22] him out
[1:14:24] then come on down I want to kiss your
[1:14:26] toe
[1:14:28] because you'd have to be almighty God
[1:14:33] what you see
[1:14:36] I might buy to sucker if you come after
[1:14:39] I made that statement but I know you
[1:14:41] ain't God
[1:14:42] I know I ain't God
[1:14:47] he said we used to always talks with God
[1:14:49] not that way
[1:14:51] not that way right
[1:14:54] but we got to depend upon him
[1:14:58] so we take his word on the first seal at
[1:15:00] the white horse riders the Antichrist
[1:15:01] that was his revelation
[1:15:05] yeah right right amen we didn't know
[1:15:07] what that was
[1:15:12] we take what he said on the second seal
[1:15:14] of the red horse
[1:15:15] what is his revelation
[1:15:19] third fourth right come on
[1:15:21] lift
[1:15:24] when you get up to there nobody ever
[1:15:26] talked about that he said everything
[1:15:28] I've listened we were the other night to
[1:15:30] himself at sealed he said everything
[1:15:33] that I saw
[1:15:35] or thought I saw was contrary to what
[1:15:37] was revealed to me
[1:15:39] in that room that's right
[1:15:45] it was his Revelation that we stand on
[1:15:47] the fifth seal of the Jews and when it
[1:15:49] is it was his revelation of The Sixth
[1:15:51] Seal and the 144 000 in the Jews and the
[1:15:55] thing
[1:15:58] now where are we going
[1:16:03] we've got a silence
[1:16:11] you know that one time he said the
[1:16:12] original silence said him caught it with
[1:16:14] nobody up there
[1:16:16] I was in his earlier Ministry
[1:16:19] I'm not going to argue that he didn't
[1:16:20] say something
[1:16:29] but now listen
[1:16:32] I want to know his revelation
[1:16:36] yeah
[1:16:37] I got a couple years ago I used to
[1:16:39] brother I used to preach for him we were
[1:16:41] so close he'd eat in our home every
[1:16:42] other week whatever
[1:16:45] and I was preaching on this and I said
[1:16:47] the prophet said this is my Revelation I
[1:16:49] said let's see if my Revelation is the
[1:16:52] same as his revelation
[1:16:55] and the brother just cut me totally off
[1:16:57] never would have nothing else to do with
[1:16:59] me sent me a word
[1:17:01] he had a revelation that run around and
[1:17:03] had the revelation
[1:17:06] all I said was I had a revelation that
[1:17:08] run around in that Revelation I thought
[1:17:10] we said the same thing but it just
[1:17:12] didn't fit in his language
[1:17:15] me
[1:17:17] but now listen church we depend upon Him
[1:17:20] Amen brother Brown
[1:17:22] what about this silence
[1:17:26] we've depended upon you so far
[1:17:29] now we must follow that channel
[1:17:32] to depend upon you all right go ahead
[1:17:35] with number five now
[1:17:37] which is paragraph 2 45 of the seventh
[1:17:39] seal
[1:17:41] sorry I flocked that money anymore
[1:17:43] sometimes it messes up things I know
[1:17:49] now none of us know
[1:17:52] we'll have something man
[1:17:53] tell you nobody don't know
[1:17:58] and he says this is my revelation
[1:18:02] little I think says that now none of us
[1:18:04] know so this is my revelation
[1:18:10] come on
[1:18:12] but if his Revelation fits the Bible
[1:18:18] right
[1:18:20] it'd be correct that's right
[1:18:23] but his Revelation takes you contrary to
[1:18:25] the scriptures anywhere
[1:18:28] he's taking you to another God
[1:18:31] you remember that in the scripture
[1:18:33] if a man come and give you a sign and
[1:18:36] the sign come to pass
[1:18:38] but he takes you to another God in that
[1:18:40] scripture don't believe him
[1:18:43] he said cause I have sent it among you
[1:18:46] to try you read the scripture
[1:18:49] see God is trying you and I to see where
[1:18:51] we'll stay with the word that's why
[1:18:53] giving us 40 something years
[1:18:55] that's the going of the Prophet yes
[1:19:00] even Moses were down in Egypt because
[1:19:02] those people would have believed him
[1:19:03] they would
[1:19:06] have went up so they had to give him
[1:19:07] some time to make up their mind
[1:19:09] right
[1:19:12] and right around said they had to be
[1:19:14] crying out for a deliverer
[1:19:16] well our fat bellies and things ain't
[1:19:18] crying a whole lot
[1:19:20] brother sent me a note there the other
[1:19:23] day gave me a note
[1:19:26] he said the great secret of things is is
[1:19:29] we need to fast on them
[1:19:31] the first day of the week on Monday he
[1:19:33] said Monday is supposed to fast
[1:19:37] well according to him it would put us in
[1:19:38] the Rapture or put us in the I'd say it
[1:19:41] do us all real good right amen
[1:19:43] you know I agree
[1:19:46] but I don't think that's the message you
[1:19:48] know I I just don't understand it that
[1:19:51] way but now look
[1:19:54] and none of us know
[1:19:57] but I'm going to tell you
[1:20:00] in my my revelation of it
[1:20:06] all right so we're totally dependent
[1:20:07] upon his Revelation right but I like to
[1:20:10] say it again we totally dependent upon
[1:20:12] the first field for his Revelation so
[1:20:14] it's no problem
[1:20:16] he wasn't standing on Shaky Ground when
[1:20:18] he got down I hope everything's going to
[1:20:20] hold you up
[1:20:21] no
[1:20:22] right he got to the place he knew he
[1:20:25] wasn't presuming amen
[1:20:28] come on
[1:20:30] he was standing on his own Revelation
[1:20:33] and your own Revelation is only thing
[1:20:37] that will keep you from presuming
[1:20:45] as certain as I stand in the platform
[1:20:48] tonight
[1:20:51] and the Revelation that released
[1:20:54] now here's his Revelation he said he had
[1:20:57] it
[1:20:59] he's been a three-fold man
[1:21:03] I will speak
[1:21:06] old of it so now he's only going to
[1:21:07] speak of a folder
[1:21:11] okay
[1:21:14] let's go with our first here's the
[1:21:16] Revelation to begin with I want to tell
[1:21:18] you what that what it is what happened
[1:21:21] is that those seven Thunders that he had
[1:21:24] heard thunder and was forbidden to write
[1:21:27] that's what the mystery is laying behind
[1:21:30] those seven consecutive Thunder from now
[1:21:35] now
[1:21:38] depended upon his revelation
[1:21:45] we'll have to break it right now
[1:21:48] I don't want to say something to you
[1:21:53] and I'll repeat it this evening about
[1:21:55] five times
[1:21:57] maybe more
[1:22:04] the book is sealed
[1:22:08] in chapter four
[1:22:10] you don't find it until actually chapter
[1:22:12] 5.
[1:22:13] it's a seal book
[1:22:16] all right
[1:22:19] the lamb breaks the seals
[1:22:23] one two three four five six seven
[1:22:28] everybody adjust real quick and says yes
[1:22:30] that's right and over in chapter 10 the
[1:22:33] book is opened
[1:22:40] they're 10. you had a book in his hand
[1:22:42] that was opened
[1:22:43] nobody didn't know what that was
[1:22:49] because immediately in 10-4 right
[1:22:55] he was told to seal up what the seven
[1:22:58] Thunders said
[1:23:04] right so where are we going Books open
[1:23:06] books books closed Books open books
[1:23:09] closed
[1:23:16] you're looking at me like thinking well
[1:23:18] you use your Crossing yourself up no I'm
[1:23:20] saying just what he said
[1:23:25] I want to make one point to you
[1:23:29] and I hope you've been able to follow
[1:23:31] this for about 40 years
[1:23:36] because in all that's followed
[1:23:40] by the opening of the word
[1:23:44] Revelations 5
[1:23:50] is in heaven right right amen it is not
[1:23:54] on Earth
[1:24:00] it is not at this time
[1:24:03] in manifestation
[1:24:05] upon the Earth
[1:24:13] Revelations 5 is a future event
[1:24:16] that's right
[1:24:20] remember John was taken up to heaven he
[1:24:23] didn't say he was taken up to the next
[1:24:25] day you know
[1:24:26] he was taken up to heaven
[1:24:29] Revelations 5 is in heaven
[1:24:33] but at this moment Revelations 5 is not
[1:24:36] a full manifestation right right I'll
[1:24:38] get back to it one of these days
[1:24:40] prove to you why
[1:24:46] that's in heaven
[1:24:51] the seals break in heaven
[1:24:57] maybe two thousand years ago
[1:25:02] wrote down by John
[1:25:04] I'm quoting right around because just
[1:25:06] get it to you
[1:25:07] he said then he has to hand it down to
[1:25:10] the seventh angel on Earth
[1:25:16] Revelations 5 is not a fulfillment yet
[1:25:19] right
[1:25:24] you said you wanted to happen
[1:25:27] John didn't go up to the year 2014
[1:25:29] that's the day of the rapture
[1:25:38] he went up into
[1:25:40] a spiritual condition
[1:25:46] he was not there in a mortal body
[1:25:51] Immortal body would lay on Earth
[1:25:56] Revelations 5.
[1:26:00] is a future event
[1:26:05] because we're not there yet
[1:26:08] is that sensible yes
[1:26:10] yes until we're there it's not physical
[1:26:13] right
[1:26:15] oh now you can all do all you want to
[1:26:17] about the resurrect sitting in Heaven's
[1:26:19] place in spiritual conditional go ahead
[1:26:22] but I'm still looking at problems don't
[1:26:26] you right you know human beings right
[1:26:29] and we're not there yet
[1:26:36] and we can't be there until all the
[1:26:39] varieties gather together
[1:26:43] then she can sing the song of redemption
[1:26:49] you said well brother Dale you've always
[1:26:51] told us that's in heaven that's what
[1:26:53] exactly right
[1:26:55] it's in heaven right it's not on Earth
[1:27:04] do we talk about we're already there but
[1:27:06] we're still here
[1:27:13] the prophet said this is my revelation
[1:27:18] this is my Revelation he said
[1:27:21] I'm a musician
[1:27:23] my revelation
[1:27:30] and he said nobody knows it
[1:27:35] looked me but
[1:27:41] he's already got into the seals and
[1:27:43] realizing something's wrong
[1:27:45] getting wasting the matchers and he
[1:27:49] makes a great statement
[1:27:52] he said it's gone from here
[1:27:59] there's no way for you to know it
[1:28:06] you are because he knew about the
[1:28:08] questions he got like Wade was saying
[1:28:10] it's good morning
[1:28:11] the question he got was whether women
[1:28:13] should wear pantyhose or what they
[1:28:15] should do with father-son Holy Ghost
[1:28:17] correct or Lord Jesus Christ or
[1:28:21] right very little comment about what
[1:28:24] he's asking them to comment on the seals
[1:28:27] three years gone from
[1:28:29] the Windows 7 still opens he doesn't
[1:28:31] have any problems
[1:28:33] of knowing he's the only person standing
[1:28:35] in that building that day right
[1:28:38] that knew what that seal was
[1:28:46] but it was his revelation
[1:28:50] now all we got to do is find out what he
[1:28:52] said
[1:28:56] then God can reveal it to you not
[1:29:01] of course everybody know I know all
[1:29:03] about
[1:29:05] it
[1:29:08] the prophet told us many things about
[1:29:11] that seven seal
[1:29:13] that's right
[1:29:15] there was a secret
[1:29:17] foreign
[1:29:48] standing there and he said
[1:29:50] he saw his name
[1:29:52] Robert said have you seen your name you
[1:29:55] know
[1:30:02] listening
[1:30:04] a secret
[1:30:06] thing no one knows but the Bride of
[1:30:10] Jesus Christ
[1:30:13] there's no way for anybody else to know
[1:30:15] it right
[1:30:17] they don't have the ability
[1:30:20] so it's going to take a prophetic
[1:30:22] Prophet we agree with that
[1:30:24] new Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10
[1:30:27] 7.
[1:30:29] if you don't read a random it would
[1:30:31] take a prophetic people
[1:30:33] to understand
[1:30:38] we're trying to make some profit and I'm
[1:30:40] trying to make you one all right let's
[1:30:42] solve the problem
[1:30:44] right I'm trying to tell you who you are
[1:30:46] and what you're doing right right amen
[1:30:48] yes sir
[1:30:50] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:54] he said on Azusa Street a prophetic
[1:30:57] Prophet came down
[1:31:00] the Holy Ghost came himself he said
[1:31:06] and why can't we believe we're a
[1:31:08] prophetic people that can't believe the
[1:31:11] impossible amen red book 87 in red book
[1:31:15] you might have a name
[1:31:45] I'm trying
[1:32:01] to every day
[1:33:06] saying
[1:33:46] that are relieved belong unto
[1:33:50] you
[1:33:52] that's great
[1:33:55] to watch reveals allow for you and I
[1:33:58] thought their secret name that we made
[1:34:00] known down to Eternity
[1:34:06] question about it
[1:34:09] a relation of what
[1:34:11] foreign
[1:35:25] foreign foreign
