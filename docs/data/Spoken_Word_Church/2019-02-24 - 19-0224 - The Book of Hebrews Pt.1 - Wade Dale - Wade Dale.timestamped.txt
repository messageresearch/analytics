[1:42] make it that's just neon we may get
[1:44] neons and you good idea use neon cuz we
[1:48] can see this better huh only problem of
[1:52] this is we're gonna talk about dot I
[1:53] don't want to forget that pink okay so
[1:57] why do you want to be black either so
[2:00] you know evil black we're good to have
[2:03] it right here today sometime telecom
[2:05] sometime you don't that's good hey mauka
[2:12] everybody make sure you say hi to
[2:14] brother Russ dunker from Manus say
[2:19] master I am I in NDS Oba we're ain't
[2:30] sold down here him in a sort of a good
[2:33] heaven bless come all the way he grow a
[2:36] long way to gets dirty let me read you
[2:49] what Schofield said about this just to
[2:54] give you the theme of what's going on
[2:56] because like I said before in the book
[2:57] of Romans I believe if you get the
[3:00] history behind why it was written you
[3:01] can understand why Paul wrote what he
[3:04] did we know many scholars refute the
[3:07] book of Hebrews being written by Paul
[3:08] but man that's nothing but Paul can
[3:11] write that there's no other prophet at
[3:14] the time they could write the book of
[3:16] Hebrews like the Apostle Paul right so
[3:19] this is we said the writer the
[3:21] authorship of Hebrews has been in
[3:22] controversy over the earliest time the
[3:24] book is anonymous but the reference in
[3:27] 2nd Peter 3:15 seems conclusive that
[3:29] Paul was the writer so 2nd Peter 3:15 so
[3:34] may get second Peter 3:15 you got a
[3:35] Bible and let's read that I'm not going
[3:37] to get it because I
[3:38] opened up to this second Peter 3:15
[3:41] seems conclusive then Paul was a writer
[3:43] see also Hebrews 1323 all agree that
[3:48] whether by Paul or another the point
[3:50] view is Paul in Ian or Pauline which
[3:53] they call the New Testament the Pauline
[3:55] he and Bible because Paul wrote eighty
[3:57] percent of it and his influence was all
[4:00] throughout all of because even though he
[4:01] did rock the book of Acts Luke root
[4:04] wrote the book of Acts it was written by
[4:05] Luke about Paul and the disciples though
[4:09] we undoubtedly have here the method of
[4:12] Paul synagogue address so my got Sega p3
[4:15] 15 brother remember reading it for
[4:17] second Peters they can be a prefect
[4:20] thing an account that the long-suffering
[4:28] of our Lord is salvation see they're
[4:36] hilarious no book of Scripture more
[4:39] fully authenticates itself as inspired
[4:42] the dates from internal evidence it is
[4:46] clear that Hebrews was written before
[4:47] the destruction of the temple in AD 70
[4:50] obviously because follow dive in 66 this
[4:54] was written in 1864 so this is heading
[4:56] toward the end of Paul's time on earth
[4:59] all right the theme is the doctrinal
[5:02] passages revealed the purpose of the
[5:04] book it is written with a two-fold
[5:07] intent one to confirm Jewish Christians
[5:10] by showing that Judaism had come to an
[5:12] end
[5:13] through the fulfillment of Christ of the
[5:14] whole purpose of the law and to the
[5:17] heart hortatory passages there what that
[5:21] means they tow RTA T or wipe acid you
[5:24] show that the rider had in view I wasn't
[5:27] gonna read this he's obvious over text
[5:28] edited but I felt led to read it because
[5:33] Scofield you know an endo that Scofield
[5:35] is a Trinitarian there's a lot of things
[5:37] he does bring out history that is
[5:39] exactly the tree alright brother brown
[5:41] use go field a lot rather omits not the
[5:45] person to come up with the word
[5:47] theophany and all those things
[5:49] Scofield wrote about it in the spin in
[5:51] the 1600
[5:52] you know or sorry in the 19th or early
[5:55] 1900 so let the but now brother Brian
[5:59] picks up by inspiration that it's the
[6:01] truth and then he then he showed us to
[6:04] that you you don't follow everything
[6:05] that Scofield said because he is a
[6:07] trinitarian and he'll tell you the
[6:09] trinity is laced throughout the bottom I
[6:11] hope we'll get on you business my trade
[6:13] may be in other people's minds it is it
[6:17] is clear from the book of Acts that even
[6:20] the strongest of the believers in
[6:21] Palestine were held to a strange
[6:23] mingling of Judaism and Christianity in
[6:27] other words like 21 18 through 24 when
[6:29] they mingled they're together and that
[6:30] snare would be especially after
[6:32] entangled professed Christians amongst
[6:34] the Jews of the dispersion get in here
[6:36] synaptic a plenty room for you any the
[6:40] key words is better Hebrews is a series
[6:44] of contrasts between the good things of
[6:46] Judaism and the better things of Christ
[6:48] Christ is better than angels than Moses
[6:51] than Joshua then Aaron and the new
[6:53] covenant then the Mosaic Covenant Church
[6:55] truth does not appear the ground of
[6:58] gathering only being stated which is
[7:00] 1313 will read that the whole sphere of
[7:03] Christian profession is before the rider
[7:05] in other words he's exhorting Christians
[7:08] but just what about was all about Hanson
[7:11] exhortation necessary to warn an alarm a
[7:14] mere professor in other words common
[7:17] people read it and get alarmed by
[7:19] Christians read it and say man that's
[7:21] the way business was done babe my sister
[7:23] just died all right Hebrews is in six
[7:26] divisions but these include five
[7:30] parenthetic passages of expectation
[7:32] number one degrade salvation number two
[7:35] the rest of God rest are as the rest of
[7:38] God which is in Chapter three and four
[7:41] our great High Priest which is in five
[7:43] to eight which is man it's going to be
[7:45] wonderful when we get into Melchizedek
[7:47] the New Covenant and the heavenly
[7:49] sanctuary which is chapter eight through
[7:52] ten
[7:53] number five the superiority of the faith
[7:56] way which is verse 11 and number six the
[7:59] worship and walk of the believer priest
[8:01] which is
[8:01] after 12 through the end of the book so
[8:04] he kind of breaks it down just keep that
[8:05] in your mind because what we're going to
[8:07] do today is it wants to see something
[8:10] that's going to help you maybe for my
[8:11] brother Dale's been preaching on the Son
[8:13] of God and Son of Man and son of David
[8:14] because right here Paul starts out God
[8:18] who had Sundra times know that Sundra is
[8:21] what many in other in other words
[8:24] Scofield the original says in many parts
[8:27] and in many ways so God who in many
[8:28] parts and in many ways spake in time
[8:31] past unto the father's by the prophets
[8:35] who was that Old Testament whilst going
[8:38] back into the Old Testaments and the
[8:40] prophets talked about God and he was
[8:45] what he was Jehovah in the Old Testament
[8:51] right hey he was also if I could get
[8:56] that a little bit deeper boy you could
[8:58] see that Kinnear
[9:00] there's your son of God now back here
[9:04] we're going to put creation there male
[9:08] camel that because in the beginning
[9:11] you're gonna look through out here that
[9:14] verse two we're going to see who he's
[9:18] talking about
[9:18] God who at sundry times name not told my
[9:22] Jesus told my God God who a son used to
[9:27] hold this thing for keep that ID month
[9:29] for a little one wait outside for a
[9:31] little one we know that but I've just
[9:35] got to read you the Bible and we got to
[9:36] figure out because Trinitarians read
[9:38] this and see it their way but we're
[9:39] gonna look at it and see there is a
[9:42] there is a position because remember
[9:47] this Creator God was not Jesus flesh
[9:52] right flesh Jesus damn I say what Jesus
[9:58] there's not flesh Jesus okay it's not
[10:01] flesh Jesus that flesh came from God but
[10:04] he had to be put in the womb it had to
[10:06] be mine your brother cuz right here this
[10:09] is not my brother wait a minute
[10:14] this is what father
[10:19] this is father when he when he comes out
[10:23] and says let there be
[10:24] he becomes the spoken word I am now I
[10:31] spoken word we know was going to
[10:33] continue on to be made flesh called son
[10:35] man Jesus Christ right if I got that
[10:39] okay now remember we're not trying to
[10:41] darienne's we're not Tunis there was one
[10:44] man standing at creation and said let
[10:46] there be now it was the same man that
[10:49] should have stood on the shores of
[10:50] Galilee in the year 80 28 went on
[10:56] whatever and there I say man but just
[10:59] different positions different offices
[11:02] alright so we looking at the son of God
[11:04] which is the spoken word know what goes
[11:07] look God who has many times and in many
[11:11] ways because remember every prophet
[11:16] didn't exactly describe God the way the
[11:18] other one did exactly you see him in
[11:21] your own revelation that's what we were
[11:24] talking last night we're going to rush
[11:25] you know the people we have been told
[11:27] for years in the denominational world
[11:29] the grandma is gone to see and he's she
[11:32] said she's walking with Jesus on the
[11:34] streets ago that's not true we know that
[11:38] but why did they say that there's not a
[11:40] doctrine in the Bible they've been told
[11:43] that they've been told that hell is
[11:45] eternal because it's not in the Bible
[11:47] they've been told that a father son Holy
[11:49] Ghost is is a trinity of people and but
[11:53] that's not true but they've been told
[11:54] that somebody do they believe it believe
[11:57] a lot and be damned by alright so we
[12:01] know that this man walks out this
[12:02] theophany man walks out says let there
[12:06] be light but then he what he is Jehovah
[12:08] father God through the Old Testament
[12:12] there is no way he can enter into the
[12:14] soul of an individual even the great
[12:17] Moses and all because remember we're
[12:20] going to look cuz Christ is better than
[12:22] angels then Moses then Joshua then Aaron
[12:26] okay now we know it was Christ in Moses
[12:28] but Moses can't even be a son of God
[12:33] he's not
[12:35] there's no son of God in the Old
[12:37] Testament except Adam when God took a
[12:40] piece of this and put it in out and made
[12:42] him a son of God it's right am i okay
[12:45] with that we got it all right but we'll
[12:47] continue just to make us watch garlic
[12:50] summertime the divers manners spake in
[12:52] times past unto the father's by the
[12:55] prophets in other words what was carried
[12:57] down from the Old Testament has come
[12:59] down now to where Paul is standing if it
[13:01] seemed in 1864 and 80 60 s we've been 30
[13:05] years since Jesus came on earth he's
[13:08] already left he's already come back into
[13:10] people and he's already into Paul and
[13:12] Paul I'm coming into him by the new
[13:15] birth all right so this is so this is
[13:19] not Paul's writing this is Paul's this
[13:21] is Paul's character but it's God God's
[13:25] writing this Paul is not taking his own
[13:28] thought and writing this with he's
[13:30] writing this by what somebody inside of
[13:34] him is telling him to write right
[13:37] we're my times pass under the father's
[13:40] by the prophets now remember you take
[13:43] Ezekiel and son brother development
[13:45] cover that prophesy Son of Man with what
[13:48] was that that was God in human flesh
[13:51] temporary temporary but you and I are
[13:57] not temporary God would come down on
[14:00] Moses and so so in dwell Moses to let
[14:04] have to hide his face he would speak in
[14:08] and God wouldn't it would just happen
[14:10] wait till Moses want a crime speak why
[14:13] that was Moses crying and one God crying
[14:15] but God would anoint in the Old
[14:18] Testament he would come down just like
[14:20] now you got to take your holy of holies
[14:21] I told you this Hebrews might last us in
[14:24] the Millennium we may not get off of
[14:27] this so thank you we may not get off of
[14:30] this for for a long time but
[14:33] you know the book of Hebrews to me it
[14:34] just covers everything so we look and
[14:36] see that went the temple when they built
[14:39] the temple in the Old Testament I've
[14:42] been back in the lead or even Leviticus
[14:44] numbers and Deuteronomy stron to get the
[14:46] law and all the feast days and stuff
[14:48] together but what happened was now they
[14:52] were a pillar of fire right cloud by day
[14:57] pillar fire by night but every once in a
[15:00] while during the first one part of the
[15:02] year that would settle down into the
[15:04] Holy of Holies one man would walk in and
[15:07] offer a sacrifice for the whole of
[15:10] Israel and the Shekinah glory would
[15:12] cover the temple they didn't cover it
[15:14] all the time it was above us
[15:16] dawn above us okay right because he
[15:19] didn't want to dwell in a box he wanted
[15:22] well into people but he couldn't because
[15:24] of what happens in the Garden of Eden
[15:25] that blocked every bit of that for man
[15:27] to get back sorry forgot to get back
[15:29] into the soul of man until he came to
[15:32] eradicate sin in the soul of man he had
[15:36] to stay above them drop down every once
[15:39] in a while and anoint Moses but then
[15:42] Moses obviously was still Moses when he
[15:46] struck the rock instead of speaking to
[15:48] it all right that was Moses and then you
[15:51] take the Elijah and Elijah and all the
[15:53] different ones you look at their life
[15:55] and you look at their prophetic their
[15:56] just their God to the people but a lot
[15:59] of people didn't pay attention to what
[16:00] they say Isaiah was killed as a young
[16:03] boy because of what he said all the
[16:06] different ones were killed and sawdust
[16:09] under Isaiah was and all the different
[16:11] ones we read that in the mob but I think
[16:12] is still in Hebrews 2 Hebrews 11 40 well
[16:17] 120 40 you cannot do away whatever we
[16:20] need to talk about going can we skip to
[16:22] Hebrews 11 40 no we gotta we gotta get
[16:25] all these other people perfect at first
[16:28] but the blood of bulls and goats that's
[16:30] what people even in the message don't
[16:32] understand the blood of bulls and goats
[16:33] only covered you see that covering
[16:35] that's a cover yes so that when sin was
[16:40] here on earth he come up to here and it
[16:43] wasn't eradicated he
[16:45] bumped up against it and it stayed right
[16:46] here right up underneath if I okay with
[16:50] that okay right like he couldn't if he
[16:54] went to God he's not to kill home right
[16:56] so it's but he didn't do away with it
[16:59] because it was still there brother
[17:01] Brandon will tell us one man go in make
[17:03] a sacrifice for committing adultery go
[17:07] right back out committed over the next
[17:08] year Brando sacrificed the next year why
[17:10] because the cover-up therefore cannot be
[17:12] made perfect by the sacrifices but seem
[17:15] when that son of God drops down into
[17:18] time see that's what makes a difference
[17:20] okay
[17:22] these were natural lambs that died just
[17:26] as they substitute for what was coming
[17:29] okay cuz watch let's continue on going
[17:34] to at Sunday time many times in many
[17:36] ways baking times past unto the father's
[17:38] by the prophets so in other words God
[17:41] would anoint Moses they would come off
[17:43] of the guard would anoint he lasts you
[17:45] listen that wasn't anointing of God of
[17:47] Elijah when he got the two she bears to
[17:51] kill the forty two kids that was the
[17:52] Elijah but remember God had an honor
[17:56] when he said he was so close because why
[17:59] didn't God say no will I show my
[18:01] daughter kill no the honor what that
[18:04] prophet said my brother branham brother
[18:06] Monson I can make this give work I can
[18:08] make it work why because he's still
[18:10] closely done in the prophetic way he's
[18:13] so close to God he can make it work oh
[18:22] my God thank you alright so in other
[18:28] words he would anoint the Prophet now
[18:29] remember when Jesus came we're gonna
[18:31] talk about a little bit later when Jesus
[18:32] came sure there was anointing that came
[18:34] oniy for his ministry but he was born
[18:37] Lord the Christ he has that Christ that
[18:39] was in the Old Testament above he had it
[18:42] in him he would didn't even have it in
[18:44] him he was in its name
[18:46] alright so but we got to stay up here
[18:48] though happened these last days spoken
[18:51] unto us by his son not this son
[18:57] he come as the Sun man okay which is God
[19:04] in human flesh now these were gone in
[19:05] human flesh but they weren't good coke
[19:08] totally residing in that flesh that's
[19:10] right
[19:10] he would anoint Moses to do what he
[19:14] needs to do then he would come off of
[19:15] that man come Moses and Moses could be a
[19:17] murderer
[19:18] each one in the Old Testament listen
[19:20] they all have flaws every one of them
[19:23] they was someone or something that they
[19:25] did on their own that even got honored
[19:27] because they were so close to the office
[19:29] but now the son of man never come down
[19:32] here and then one day you saw him out
[19:33] drinking a beer and then the next day
[19:35] you saw him promise on her being gone no
[19:38] he would got all the time not that he
[19:40] wasn't inhuman nothing he didn't have to
[19:42] eat and even have bad thoughts you got
[19:46] to remember his best friend let's just
[19:52] say this was his best friend was man
[19:55] Magdalene at one time and she was a
[19:57] prostitute so he had to see that world
[19:59] going around him young talents in other
[20:01] words what I'm saying is Jesus didn't
[20:03] get up and all of a sudden all the sin
[20:05] that's laid down you know just lay it
[20:07] out off of him you know and I didn't
[20:08] know the Bible says demons came to him
[20:11] after the 40-day in the wilderness the
[20:14] demons bothered him during that whole
[20:15] time and God sent angels the straight
[20:17] thing why because he was in a human body
[20:19] he was subject to be your brother this
[20:22] is not your brother that's right
[20:24] this is daughter liya mm-hmm it's not
[20:27] your brother this is your brother okay
[20:28] you're going to buy right with that like
[20:31] I said sandy you can be a son man by the
[20:38] new birth but you can't ever be the son
[20:41] of man because you were born from a
[20:42] Monday through a sexual act and that's
[20:46] not the one I want
[20:47] okay but now that part that come into
[20:50] you this part here when it comes into
[20:52] you that makes you a child of God you
[20:55] retain your Paul says follow me in the
[20:59] one regaining or regeneration
[21:00] all right in other words so we're being
[21:02] a rejean from the inside
[21:04] we still have the same genetics we were
[21:06] born with but we're being rejean I was
[21:09] telling us last night and I'm working on
[21:14] a little project to bring out a point of
[21:19] what the world sees normal we see
[21:21] abnormal what we see right what we see
[21:25] normal they see uneven vice versa book
[21:27] my thing
[21:27] we're so abnormal you still London and
[21:30] you don't need to make yourself brother
[21:31] perhaps and don't make yourself on he
[21:32] said you're already on okay the things
[21:35] that the world is just you look out and
[21:37] they just you know they hang on politics
[21:39] and they hang on sports figures in
[21:42] Hollywood and and so on so American zone
[21:45] you get those little people magazines
[21:47] and you walk by the wall Martin they put
[21:50] the magazines right here where when you
[21:51] stop you gotta read them all woman born
[21:54] with four you know and alien born for a
[22:00] woman and you're sitting there going
[22:07] they play right here
[22:09] and we read them now we may not pick the
[22:12] book up and bottom but now see that's
[22:14] what they call normal just to pick it up
[22:17] and buy it would be abnormal if you saw
[22:20] that in what is once the name of one of
[22:23] them is it global no anyway so you know
[22:32] you've looked up inquiring minds want to
[22:39] know that's not that's the name of a
[22:40] planet and we want to inquire about this
[22:44] this what we're acquiring about today
[22:46] happened these last days days 2000 years
[22:49] so Paul is at the beginning of the
[22:51] church ages but he knows that this is
[22:54] gonna last all the way to the
[22:55] consummation hath in these last days
[22:58] spoken unto us by his son whom he had
[23:02] whom he hath the partner whom he who
[23:04] need God
[23:06] and appointed the Sun not the bit too
[23:08] different people say here's were trying
[23:10] to say oh man the Sun is the Sun is
[23:13] getting something from the father
[23:15] position that's right
[23:17] position position Jesus Christ is God
[23:21] Almighty in human flesh but at one time
[23:23] he wasn't in human flesh now I don't
[23:27] like some I'm not going to ever preach
[23:29] on it or hey this may be all I can say
[23:31] online but there was enough substance of
[23:34] God in the Garden of Eden we said well
[23:36] he was a spirit he was a theophany he
[23:38] killed two lambs pulled their skins off
[23:42] and throw them into bushes for Adam and
[23:44] Eve so he must have some substance more
[23:47] than just you know floating like go in
[23:50] you know no gods person and he had
[23:53] something you can call it flash for what
[23:55] are you going through but that the often
[23:56] he was really real it was like there's
[24:00] nothing like that that's in these last
[24:02] days spoken unto us by son let me have
[24:05] to point in heir of all things know you
[24:07] so you go back to Roman's when we were
[24:09] in Romans 2 Jesus Christ we are heirs
[24:11] and join it we can't be drawing heirs
[24:13] with this guy he's never sinned a day in
[24:17] his life this is never a man that's been
[24:20] tempted this man was tempted same man
[24:26] different form this man's been tempted
[24:29] you can't tempt this man that's why
[24:30] that's why he kept Jesus kept pointing
[24:33] back to who mother the father is greater
[24:38] than me well why because the father's
[24:40] the creator he never he never lived the
[24:43] day on this earth that he had to worry
[24:45] about a prosecute walking by and with no
[24:46] clothes on but when that man decided
[24:50] because of me and you see he decided all
[24:53] this because of men you had to come down
[24:56] here to get us he had to be this and he
[25:00] come down through this barrier see from
[25:01] right look from right here up is eternal
[25:04] from right here down had to be made
[25:07] eternal now the son of man didn't have
[25:11] to be made eternal but that flesh he was
[25:13] living in he had to be made eternal
[25:15] that's my brother Brown said he said
[25:17] what did Jesus inherited he inherited
[25:20] eternal life now he didn't have to enter
[25:22] paired eternal life cause he was this
[25:24] guy this is eternal life but he
[25:26] inherited eternal life in his body and
[25:28] then he didn't just keep it he made a
[25:30] way for me and you to do alright so
[25:33] after these last days spoken to us by
[25:35] son whom he has appointed heir of all
[25:37] things by whom also he made the world so
[25:41] who is making the world the Creator
[25:43] that's why Peter said thou art the
[25:47] Christ the Son of the Living God Christ
[25:50] we're gonna do this again - we got to
[25:52] the crime stuff here so this man become
[25:55] who Jesus Christ
[25:59] there was many Jesuses in that day there
[26:03] was many Judas's there were common names
[26:05] there even common names now but there
[26:07] was never a Jesus Christ okay do I got
[26:11] that that's not leave baptize not in the
[26:13] name of the Lord it's me we baptize in
[26:16] the name of the Lord - giving his
[26:17] ownership rulership Jesus Christ that's
[26:20] the complete baptism because really to
[26:27] be technical nobody in the Bible was
[26:29] ever that was written was baptizing them
[26:31] with Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says in
[26:33] Jesus name that's where the Jesus name
[26:34] people get it and Jesus Christ it never
[26:37] says Lord Jesus Christ but when we had a
[26:39] property come along to tell us that he's
[26:41] our Lord so we give him that we give him
[26:44] that position
[26:45] - not we'll give it to him but I'll
[26:46] words he's in that position because of
[26:48] us to be the Lord you gotta have
[26:51] somebody to lord over all right so
[26:53] here's here's Jehovah God in the Old
[26:56] Testament can't come down through the
[26:59] the red the blood or our the blood of
[27:03] bulls and goats is right here right
[27:04] mm-hmm I didn't write that but this is
[27:06] the blood but it is a substitute God's
[27:10] own will put this blanket here so I
[27:11] don't kill anybody cuz it's not even
[27:14] just come right now with angry eyes and
[27:16] just kill everybody
[27:17] on the face of the earth and he would
[27:18] start all over again but he said I'm
[27:21] going to in to me genesis 3:15 greatest
[27:25] great script in the world i'll put
[27:28] enmity what is enmity division I'll put
[27:31] division between me and the people but
[27:37] I'm gonna come down and I'm going to do
[27:40] what bruise the head of the servant so
[27:42] when you do you come down through that
[27:43] and became the Son of Man which is now
[27:47] man blood and the Laughing Man blood is
[27:53] different from the life and animal blood
[27:54] animal blood it has a life in it but
[27:57] there's no soul no controlling factor
[28:00] read your Bible read the prophets
[28:02] message the word if you really
[28:06] understand the word if I got this
[28:09] because the Bible says that that the
[28:13] word is a discerner of the thoughts and
[28:16] intents of the heart
[28:17] dividing asunder the joint número
[28:22] dividing asunder of the soul in the
[28:24] spirit the joint Ameri so if you know
[28:27] the word there's a body of spirit of
[28:29] soul in a man there's only a body and a
[28:32] spirit in animals so that's one of the
[28:39] killing an animal it's not murder
[28:43] that's murder s brother Brian said you
[28:47] just like gonna kill animals here
[28:48] consider you but now you're not a
[28:52] murderer according to the law Colicchio
[28:55] animals all the time
[28:57] sacrifices I mean that was a whole deal
[28:59] God looked at them sacrifices and said
[29:02] I'm gonna withhold all this sin until I
[29:05] get down here and I'm gonna make one
[29:06] sacrifice that's what we're gonna read
[29:08] in Hebrews he said he sacrificed one
[29:10] time for all if the blood of bulls and
[29:12] goats would have worked there would have
[29:14] been no there would have been no need
[29:16] for the preacher or pastor to get up
[29:19] every Sunday and preach he could have
[29:21] just preached one service and be done
[29:22] with it that's basically what he said
[29:24] but now we have to go whoever the way
[29:27] let's go back but he made one sacrifice
[29:29] for
[29:29] so the son of man is the one that made
[29:32] the sacrifice he was the sacrifice
[29:34] behold the lamb of God that's not the
[29:37] lamb of God this is the Lamb of God okay
[29:42] that's why are you gonna see and I hope
[29:45] rather Dale covers it later on but you
[29:47] know we're talking about the other day
[29:50] this is the way I see even revelations
[29:54] filed he took the book this man no this
[29:57] is one it was sitting on the throne this
[30:00] man took the book behold the lamb of God
[30:04] take what's in the world then you go
[30:05] look and said John what you see I turned
[30:08] from the line of the troubleshooter when
[30:10] you turn EC saw a bloody lamb this guy
[30:13] doesn't bleed never happens that what
[30:15] I'm saying it's not two different guys
[30:17] I'm saying guys so you can understand it
[30:19] in plain language this guy don't bleed
[30:21] this guy bled so who was standing in
[30:27] front of the throne he was sitting on
[30:29] the throne that's the Father's throne
[30:31] today the son of man came around the
[30:34] throne and you see the bloody lamb he
[30:35] takes the book the Sig steelbook of
[30:39] redemption and there she said my seal
[30:41] right there the son of man this is not
[30:43] this is not the Seventh Seal if the
[30:47] Seventh Seal was for our Redemption this
[30:49] is all Redemption this God doesn't need
[30:51] redeem his body needed redeeming right
[30:55] Jesus's body needed to be redeemed all
[30:58] right and as being redeemed now you and
[31:01] I can be redeemed so that she seventh
[31:03] seal the six seals is what sealed up in
[31:07] the buck and we're sitting here today
[31:09] opening the book trying to get the
[31:11] people to see but who took it the son of
[31:14] man took them up so you there's got to
[31:16] be in the end time there's got to be a
[31:17] revelation of the son of man take the
[31:19] book okay
[31:22] we alright with that but man blood what
[31:25] died Forest had in these last days
[31:27] spoken this by son whom he had appointed
[31:28] heir of all things by whom also he made
[31:31] the world we made everything by this man
[31:35] which was what John 1:1 in the beginning
[31:37] was the word the Word was with God and
[31:40] the Word was God
[31:42] 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and
[31:46] dwelt among us right but can you get it
[31:50] this way in the beginning was rush and
[31:53] the theophany form can we lift it can
[32:05] you swallow one time and read that John
[32:08] one let's go to John 1 cuz gotta be
[32:13] personal right man it's hot in here
[32:17] that's alright
[32:19] I'm sweating in the beginning now
[32:23] remember we we put our earthly name in
[32:25] there because that's the only way that I
[32:26] can identify Russ when I say Russ you
[32:30] know exactly who I'm talking about
[32:31] let's go right here so in the beginning
[32:32] was rushed and rushed with with God and
[32:38] rush was God the same was in the
[32:43] beginning with God
[32:45] if he's born again today not the man I'm
[32:48] looking at but that the Anthony man
[32:51] that's inside of this brother are you
[32:53] sisters nor anybody that was in this
[32:56] right here that said let there because
[33:00] where'd you come from I've always
[33:01] preached on Genesis 1:26 remember
[33:03] gentlemen 26 in the creation but it's
[33:05] not in creation where there's a there's
[33:07] a beginning and an ending thing is they
[33:10] bringing forth are stepping forward out
[33:12] of something so in the beginning you
[33:15] were there in the beginning we've done
[33:17] any work on cuz if you were h-hello how
[33:22] many times I told you weeks are still
[33:24] tunas tunas is Antichrist we think that
[33:28] well when God created he was standing
[33:29] there creating and all of us were
[33:31] standing around him not at that moment
[33:33] we weren't we were in that man and you
[33:37] know what if you're if you're God
[33:40] there's no part of you that's evil
[33:43] there's no part of you that someone else
[33:46] there's no part of you that is anything
[33:48] else
[33:53] I'm telling you that the only way we're
[33:55] gonna understand this Bible is because
[33:57] the guy that wrote is inside of you and
[34:00] you have to literally see my brother
[34:03] said when brother when Jesus walked the
[34:05] shores of Galilee where were you you
[34:07] were in that mass so I can understand
[34:10] what happened with Jesus when he did the
[34:12] things he did if you got the same guy
[34:13] inside of you so and then let's read
[34:18] verse 14 and the rest was made flesh see
[34:24] we put that all of Jesus but if you're
[34:26] born again today your word from the word
[34:28] inside of you is made made flesh because
[34:31] you were born by what the word you
[34:32] weren't burned by mom and daddy on that
[34:34] birth you were born by the Word of God
[34:36] which is who died right here this is the
[34:41] speaker this way the one that did the
[34:43] speaking to watch Paul look who being
[34:47] the brightness of his glory and the
[34:53] Express image of his person so in other
[34:57] words this guy's the same guys this guy
[35:02] how do you express something you talk
[35:06] about when you express something you
[35:09] talk about it thirty Jesus talking about
[35:11] the father cuz that's all they can
[35:14] understand they couldn't understand that
[35:16] that was the father talking to them
[35:18] Peter I mean no sorry Philip if you've
[35:21] seen me you've seen the father but then
[35:25] the Bible says no man st. garden anytime
[35:28] Jesus was expressing that's what you and
[35:30] I have to come to a place to where we we
[35:33] can't be a second person well we're
[35:35] trying to express oh I know they're
[35:37] trying to devil's trying to express card
[35:38] yeah it's like a rush state you made a
[35:41] good point the other night last 994
[35:43] lasted that Satan kind of fivefold
[35:45] ministry just like Jesus if he's a
[35:47] copycat he's got his fivefold ministry
[35:49] possible profits pastors teachers and
[35:51] evangelist yeah just like Christ has his
[35:54] apostles prophets pastor teachings of
[35:56] angels that was a good point because
[35:58] that's the truth cuz remember they're
[36:00] trying to be masters of the light
[36:02] they're trying to be ministers of
[36:03] righteousness but they're all they're
[36:08] not all devils but they've let the devil
[36:10] enter in and do things that we say is
[36:13] not normal they stay stays normal here
[36:15] we go with the normal map normal again
[36:18] so as I say we we must see that when God
[36:22] in morphe from here to here he just
[36:26] stepped over and revealed his total self
[36:29] in another way not me standing here and
[36:33] another guy's gonna be here and the Holy
[36:35] Ghost is gonna be here okay all right
[36:39] collect your Trinity the Trinity is they
[36:42] see all these separations and they can't
[36:44] put them all together because they don't
[36:46] understand theophany they don't
[36:49] understand this is this theophany here
[36:51] is the same here same here same here the
[36:55] same theophany of God that was staying
[36:58] said let there be because that's what
[36:59] they told him they said thou art the
[37:00] Christ the Son of the Living God thou
[37:04] art the creator in other words what was
[37:06] inside of that man they knew they
[37:08] watched him create they watched him take
[37:11] five loaves and two fishes and make two
[37:14] more fishes and hundred more fishes and
[37:16] higher more lows but now remember here's
[37:22] the catch remember Jesus didn't just
[37:24] create from nothing when he was here on
[37:27] earth tell me there's not one thing he
[37:32] took what was already here and created
[37:36] right okay but now you see brother Brown
[37:40] come down a manifest his son died he
[37:42] created squirrel for nothing that's what
[37:46] God wants us to be delayed a long time
[37:49] we may need something you know what well
[37:51] you're creating all the time you're
[37:52] great atmosphere you create all these
[37:54] different things we'll get
[37:55] a little bit later I just want to kind
[37:56] of give you that that little point but
[38:01] remember we take this man and we go
[38:03] while he's over here all these over here
[38:04] we're over here
[38:06] if you don't read yourself in the Bible
[38:08] says the Word was made flesh the word in
[38:11] you was made flesh in you the day you
[38:12] got born again we were talking about
[38:17] something last night Enzo
[38:20] everybody's looking for the last scene
[38:22] well I'm not I'm not live from last see
[38:27] God knows who that seat is maybe in
[38:30] China and Africa rabbit but my job is is
[38:34] to when we get the baby here company
[38:37] mature come the last seat may already be
[38:40] in but he can't be a baby and take a
[38:42] body change he's got to be a grown
[38:45] individual in the word take a body
[38:47] change then when he comes to a place if
[38:50] he's gonna take a body change we gotta
[38:53] wait on that guy to get there but you
[38:54] gotta have somebody teach you how to get
[38:55] up there you don't just keep feeding
[38:57] milk all right so I'm not looking for
[39:02] the last thing you gotta find him and
[39:03] when he does this is our responsibility
[39:05] to feed him enough to get him on his
[39:07] feet to where he's not wobbling like a
[39:09] baby
[39:09] you know he's walking on his own two
[39:11] feet having these last days pulling us
[39:15] by son I told you we're worse to him
[39:16] about done here by whom also he made the
[39:19] world with three three and then we'll
[39:20] stop right here to be the brightness of
[39:23] his glory and the Express image of his
[39:25] person and upholding all things by the
[39:28] word of his power when he had by himself
[39:33] no one else there was not three people
[39:36] on the cross
[39:38] one person purged him by himself
[39:45] look by his self upholding all things by
[39:50] the word of his power when he had by
[39:53] himself purged or what was that meant
[39:56] the Dunaway
[39:57] he didn't just hide them the blood of
[40:01] bulls and goats hid your sin it wasn't
[40:06] no more when this man came when sin came
[40:08] up here that turns into Christ's blood
[40:17] my brother Brian tells us in the token
[40:20] message that there's a red ring of blood
[40:22] all the way around the world even today
[40:24] but it's not animal blood where the sin
[40:27] goes up and just keeps bumping now the
[40:30] world does because they're still under
[40:31] the law that's right but if you're in
[40:34] Christ when your Sam goes in here and
[40:36] goes through that blood it turns white
[40:38] red the red is white so that's what
[40:41] that's what God sees he sees his he sees
[40:44] the blood that He shed so what you're
[40:46] gonna do he's gonna by himself
[40:48] cleansed our sin I'm sorry sins that's
[40:56] an S on their sins sat down on the right
[41:00] hand of the Majesty on high now he's
[41:02] sitting on the right hand of the Father
[41:05] remember who was the last one that moved
[41:08] the first one that died Stephen Stephen
[41:11] looks up and sees Christ standing up
[41:13] he's not standing here in the father's
[41:15] stead on the throne he's come to a
[41:17] position to a power and authority jesus
[41:20] said when he raised he said all power in
[41:22] heaven there's been given unto me why
[41:23] who was he given from the father
[41:26] in other words there was no when he came
[41:29] out of that grave there was no flesh man
[41:32] that was on the earth and God man that
[41:34] was inside of it he became a guard flesh
[41:37] man when he came another grave all power
[41:41] in heaven earth he didn't have to eat
[41:42] this man he wasn't ever tempted again
[41:46] and see before - you say what power
[41:49] stranges that everybody in that six
[41:52] dimension to the
[41:53] is passed on from this life thing that
[41:55] does not tempt they don't have a black
[41:57] doll they're not thinking things what
[42:00] they gotta do but it's done it's been
[42:03] cleansed by what Christ did and then he
[42:07] is holding them in a place of purity and
[42:09] perfection verse 4 being made so much
[42:13] better than the Angels and he has by
[42:15] inheritance Wendy and Eric eternal life
[42:17] in his body obtained a more excellent
[42:20] name than all the angels so let's go
[42:25] keep reading Hebrew reading Hebrew
[42:27] series to just that for our treatment so
[42:29] don't read the Hebrew seer didn't say a
[42:31] lot about one more damn can I give you
[42:41] right do you think that's there
