was wonderful Masterpiece and brother Lise also I sure appreciate um setting the stage for everything today um well I'm just going to I'm going to take the same scriptures this afternoon that I took Wednesday night and just kind of do a a little rehash and uh and and talk about some of those things again let's just go to the Lord in pray Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word Lord Jesus and look into these things and these things that will give us strength to equip us to fight the devil lord I pray God that you'll help us this afternoon that you'll give us strength to give it back to the devil lord the devil seems like he's just run rough shot over so many Lord and it shouldn't be when you've given us such power such promises laying here in the word and I pray God as you'll just anoint the hearers anoint the speaker Lord this afternoon Lord and Lord just move Among Us to this afternoon Lord God to give us strength help us now Lord we pray pray in your name amen so just take for a title the the enforcement of restoration reclaiming what belongs to us you know we we it's one thing to know that there's some things that belong to you but how do you get it how do you get it so that's what I want to just kind of hammer on tonight this afternoon it's not night but afternoon so in Joel chapter 1 veres 1 it says the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pethel here hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten think about what uh you know brother R said that these are insects that kind of evolve one into the other they go into each each is a different stage of the next what the strange way to depict what would these things look like these are not natural insects we're talking about these are spiritual it's just it's the devil moving through the stages but in Joel chapter 2 it says and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the korm and the caterpillar and the pommer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty I like that now you're going to have plenty to eat amen and you're going to be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God so there's some praise bundled up in there that true worship is going to be restored that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you don't have nothing to be ashamed about when you believe this amen amen you may be seated the Lord out his Blessing to the reading of the word now uh you know sometimes I I think it it we if we kind of get out of this mode of you know when we come to church we're not coming to hear a lecture or coming to hear a seminary speech or coming to hear uh somebody recite some words but we're actually coming to do battle there there's actually something spiritual happening and you know many times we we kind of gets away from us that there are there are you know brother random said that the angels of the Lord would accompany the word when the message is being preached the scripture says that the angels of the Lord are camped around those that fear Him the angels of the Lord are here and brother B said the devil likes to be in church the devil likes to get in amongst us so there's something Supernatural happening that is beyond what we can see with our own natural eyes and you know you think about these these bugs here the pommer worm or strange insect and a locust and a cankerworm and a caterpillar and all these bugs this Army that was sent to to take away the things that were promised from you and I and I I really I I really began to meditate on these are not just it's not just a story but these it symbolizes an actual spiritual happening something spiritual taking place amen I I I I personally have some experience personal experience overcoming and fighting battles with the devil I I remember when I was younger uh before I the Lord really began to deal with me uh it in kind of in that in between time I knew I needed to be saved but I hadn't really started to fight yet and uh one one night I was I took a little nap after I got home from school and and I was laid on the bed and I fell into asleep and I had a dream and in the dream I was laying on my bed and I was looking up at the ceiling and I saw this looked like a locust looked like a bug that was about 5T long sitting up uh on the on the ceiling of the room where I was in and I opened my eyes from sleep and a strange dream the room was was in the exact same stage as it was when I was asleep every I was positioned the same I was on the bed the same the only thing different is like the shutter open my eyes open and so what I'm trying to express with you is that there are things that we fight there are things that you're fighting even now that you might not be able to see but it's real so what I'm reading about a locust when I'm reading about a PM worm I'm not reading just about some story but I'm reading about something real right and you know when a minister preaches that many times they're not just preaching from something that they've learned in like a seminary or something but they're preaching from a personal experience and if I have overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony then I can relay to you in the same way how you can overcome if we are overcoming we're not speaking from something we just learned in a school but we're speaking from something that we have personally experienced so what I'm relaying to you this afternoon is that there's a promise in the Bible that these things will be restored to you and whatever the devil has tried to take away from you there's a promise that it will be given back to you now if it's given back to the church it's there's a promise laying here that it'll be given back to the bride as a whole but what about to you as an individual but because you are part of the body of Christ that same promise is related to you individually because you're part of the Bride that that we're talking about a bride tree but you're part of that tree so all these promises that are given to you oh we're part of Christ so everything promised to him We're join a with him so we get part of that and everything promised to the bride we're part of that we're part of that body so restoration is promised to you and I so when brother brandham says that these things can be enforced we're not talking about just learning something in school but talking about going to battle against the devil and you know I think sometimes we fail to understand that the devil the devil can attack he'll attack somebody that ain't even born again yet but then he'll come and attack somebody that's born again and and like sister Shepherd begin to pounder in her mind and make her think that she ain't born again and take away her peace and take away your joy and TW you don't even you come to church and you're wondering if you're still born again yet you're wondering what's real and what's not and that ain't right that's the devil trying to take it away from you you know brother R said that cancer was one of the worst worst diseases one of the worst things but you know he said worse than that is nervousness he said and you know that's what the devil it's a devil that will come and plague somebody put some plague little little poor little sister with nervousness get all nervous and you know why that's such a horrible thing because if you're nervous you just can't hardly think straight you can't get your mind lined up to look at the word of God correctly but you know God give us a promise that you don't have to be nervous you don't have to be fearful you don't have to wonder if God's word is true because God's word said it and if he promised it he'll stand behind it now see that's how you enforce the claim of God how you enforce it as you look at what God Said and you said God you said it I'm going to take advantage of what you promised now now going back to my own personal experience I I I I I there's many things that I've related to my family that I will not go through now but I I had a real real when I was younger real battle with the devil and how you want to overcome when you're the devil's putting thoughts into your minds and and coming to you with all kinds of ideas and telling you you ain't this and telling you ain't that is you you must take it back to the word the word is how you do battle with the Devil the word is your ammunition the word is the thing that you can it ain't just something that we're learning about it's something that is real that will really give you overcoming power against the devil now you see you you watch you watch young people sometimes they'll get on their on their FaceTime with their friends and they'll giggle about life or whatever and then later on they'll go back and and they'll say well well I've been having these depression thoughts and things but you see if you get away from all the thing all the things of this world and put your nose in the Bible put your nose in the scripture I'm telling you this it will work when you really need something from God if you if you'll begin to lay hold of what God promised and say well you promised that you're able of these stones to rise up children to Abraham you promised that you will not give a stone to somebody that's asking for a blessing you promised it that God will back up his promise now that's how you get real overcoming power in your life that's how you see your joy and your peace and your faith and all that the devil took away from you restored and God wants to give you back everything that the devil took away from you maybe tonight you're sitting here the devil's taking so much away from you maybe he's taking away your health maybe he's taking away all all the things that are listed here but if God said it could come back it'll come back if you believe it it just depends on your belief it depends on your faith one time this little sister come up in the prayer line and she said brother brandom she was all in a turmoil of her mind brother brandom I I I feel like nervous I I feel like nothing's right nothing everything's wrong I feel like every the world's t upside down and she said he he began to talk to her and encourage her and and and she said should I feeling like this I feel like I'm about to die should I still believe oh what a question for a prophet and he said he said you yes you should believe in spite of all the conditions in spite of all the circumstances oh it doesn't matter what the world looks like it doesn't matter what it doesn't matter what your flesh looks like it doesn't matter what mental condition you're in just look at God's word and believe look at God's word God's word is the ammunition that you need to overcome am the Locust that Locust is real you know you know what I did when the devil began Onslaught with me is I it it made me get serious it made me get real serious I I I knew I needed God maybe you're at a a at a junction time in your life where where you just hadn't really got serious yet or you're serious about your friends you're serious about Facebook you're serious about the movies that you like to watch you're serious about all these things and then at the end of The Journey you got depression and mind battles and all those kind of things but if you'll just get really serious about whether these things are true or not get really serious like the berans they got the flipping through their scripture and checking out what Paul was preaching get really serious about the word and get really serious about believing God's word that's how you'll get overcoming power oh restoration means to bring back to the former owner to to bring back to a former state of condition to make things right not to just Patch It Up not to just take a hole in the tire and put a patch on it but to bring it back to the way that there what the way that the owner originally saw it the way that God started you in his mind before the foundation of the world that's what God wants to bring you back bring you back to where you've got power and authority over the devil and you don't have to listen to none of his junk you don't have to listen to none of his trash that he brings to you you you don't have to listen to it because you won't take none of his garbage oh you know what a terrible thing to lose part or all of your inheritance if we realize what a terrible thing it is to lose your inheritance when you when you when God promised to you Joy that you can have joy that you that you can have peace in your heart and not be tossed about hither and yawn not to be tossed about wondering whether or not you really got the baptism of the Holy Ghost or not but what a wonderful thing to see it restored yes I got to reading in the in the Bible there's a story in Numbers chapter 27 about this man named zapah had he was a man from the tribe of Manasseh and he died without any sons and all he left just daughters now in the Old Testament law daughters they didn't have no inheritance sorry you're out of look if you a girl you didn't get all this land that zalafa had had all the property all the all the men servants servants what whatever was on the list the role of the inheritance and we'll say it like this all the joy all the peace all the love all that packaged up in the inheritance was gone cuz they were daughters and they didn't have nothing oh but they got they went up to Moses and they begin to plead their case and Moses went before God and he went before the elders at the Ten of meeting and God answered back and what he did was he made a Prov he changed change added some things to the Old Testament law and made a provision so that they would not lose their inheritance they could go back and claim because there were there would not been a provision before but now there was a new inheritance law that was set up to allow daughters to inherit if there were no Sons now I thank God that sometimes you you might think that there's no way back to what you have lost but God by his grace gives away back to restore to you the things that were lost you know that's what Grace is is Grace is where God God being a a god of Integrity a god of Honor he required he required faith and he required he required Holiness and when we fail that the only thing that the only thing that can meet that requirement was a sacrifice and a sacrifice had to be made to meet the requirements of a god with Integrity a god with honor and so now we're not looking we're not looking to our own merits but we're looking to his grace where he paid the price on the cross oh that's what Grace is Grace is unmar favor to pay the way back to our inheritance to pay so oh that's what that's what brother Aaron was preaching about this morning if you need something this morning if you're looking in the word of God and it says you've got a right to it you've got a right because the price has already been paid Jesus already paid the price on the cross now that that doesn't matter whether it's whether it's healing in your body whether you got problems in your back whether you got problems in your mind whether you got problems in your soul it doesn't matter God's bringing you you know faith is one of the fruits the theine fruits of the spirit and this is not just little baby Faith but this is mature Faith where you can lay hold to the promises of God and say like Abraham it doesn't matter what the conditions are but if God promise me a child I'm going to hang on to his promise and I'm going to see it fulfill in my life Faith is one of the promises one of the promises are the fruits of God faith where you can believe what God promised God is restoring us back back to what to brotherly love to a real kind of love a real kind of love where we look past the differences with one another a real kind of worship and worship real worship is based upon a re a true revelation of of Jesus Christ a Unity among Believers the power of the Holy Spirit and re Revel what is it it's the unrestricted life of the Holy Ghost through flowing through the church to do what drive out the devil drive out the devil and you can see where these these these these bugs they ate down all these things through the church ages they ate them down but God give us a promise that he's going to restore so he sent these four life Messengers to restore Martin Luther and John Wesley and what is it it's not they're not restoring just some things that we learned in a seminary just some things that we can learn about and store up in our memory but there they're restoring back the power of God God in the church and now that's what I believe that this is speaking of the power of God restored in the church where you can walk in power and walk in Liberty and walk in peace and walk in Joy walk in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost the true token restored walk in the understanding the rapturing faith of the Elijah the Capstone message of Elijah that was promised of in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord himself shall descend I thank God that he didn't just send it but he come himself the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first he's coming with a message he's come with a message and the voice of the Archangel to follow that pattern is when the bride begins to get it the bride begins to get it that you don't have to take nothing from the devil and begins to recognize the devil in all his tricks the devil comes with his mind battles and his thoughts now you do you see how to fight the devil this afternoon the devil you're you're like on a pendulum and if you start looking at the word of God you've got power over the devil if you start listening to the LIE of the devil then the devil can swoop in and start taking the joy out of your home he can start messing with your Harmony he he he'll start coming in but if you just keep your eye right on the Promises of God that's how we enforce it and brother said if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place oh you can enforce it you can enforce now now that's some that's a powerful statement that that how you going to enforce it by believing what God's word says amen That's How Strong the word of God is that you look at God's word and believe it and it will do what it says amen now that's how you young people that's how you fight the devil when the Devil comes with all these thoughts where you ain't nothing you ain't worth nothing none of your friends like you none of your friend listen you you you'll come down to the end of the road one time and find out that it really don't matter how many people like you or don't like you oh we we sometimes we want to go through life and we want to we want to we want to end up without any critics without any anybody saying anything negative about us but I I'm I'm sorry to tell you if if you live a life of sin people are going to say stuff about you if you live a life of right some people are going to say stuff about you I I I get astonished sometimes listening to these preachers that I greatly admire that the great Fighters and Warriors of the faith and they'll talk about how people say stuff about them they're believing and and see great Miracles following their Ministry and thing and people will say see it doesn't matter how close to God you live it don't matter people are going to say stuff no regardless so you might as well just forge ah head and look straight at God's word and ignore all the critics amen you're going to have critics anyway you sure are you're going to have critics anyway no matter what oh you think about just like the children of Israel were going back to the original there's so many stories of a restoration in the scripture just like zalafa had and and just like Ruth and the children of Israel going back into the promised land and you know when the children of Israel got back into the promised land and Joshua began to place them exactly where they were supposed to go they still had some fighting to do you are not going to overcome without a battle character is a victory it's not a gift you got to go through some uh like some Louis or somebody was saying this morning you you got to go through some suffering right you got to go through some trials to see how you're going to react what's your reaction going to be you know when the children of Israel got in their promised land they had they had the old corn of the land laid out before them they could they could eat those those seven seal mystery promises laying out for them you know Joshua even wrote the land of the the few tribes that were left over in a seven sealed book and sealed it up and they had all those things laying there in the promised land but they had to fight for every inch of ground they they wanted they had to fight for every they had to fight for their love and fight for their joy and fight for their peace it wasn't it wasn't going to be any peace without fighting fighting for it you got to fight for what you for what God has promised and you know they came up against the you know what a Philistine is a Philistine is a Critic that's why you can't get away from a crit a Philistine a Philistine is everywhere you you ain't this you ain't that you ain't going to be this and just pointing fingers and and this and you know they had some other people that they were fighting against the amalekites and amalekites are the kind of people that run in your home and steal your wife steal your steal your family steal your joy run in there sneak in at night and run and and take things away and you know you got to still watch out for that kind of thing even in your in in the spiritual battles of the day you got to watch out for the devil sneaking in your home and grabbing stuff away amen amen you know in your home your home is supposed to be your little Sanctuary where you're set away where you know I I used to when I used to drive down I work from home now but when I used to go down into Atlanta I'd get on that Subway and you'd see all kind of sites see all kind of terrible things and when I get back home I my wife would greet me at the door with a a nice cooked meal and everything and and and I it's like wow I made it I'm home now that's that's what home is supposed to be a home is where you're supposed to have it Sanctified and it's supposed to be set apart so the world ain't in there cuz you don't want to deal when you get home you don't want to you don't want to see no weird Picture Show I saw all that in Atlanta I want to leave that in Atlanta when you get home you want to you don't want to see all that naist and filth you get off the subway and I look around this look that like the devil's everywhere but you get home and and you're at peace and that's why your home is your is a man's Castle and a man's got a right to keep his castle separate from the world you should it should be your place where you come home and you you've got it set apart from God you got it in order that's that's a man's right to to have overcome the devil in your home amen I've gotten trouble in the past because you know people want to come over and the the kids friends and stuff they want to come over dressing like the world and doing things but I'm listen you you come over to my home this is this is set part I if we want to if you want to go meet to the at the mall or something and and and witness or you know meet at school or at your job or something and tell somebody about the Lord but when you come to my house you at least got to dress appropriately you at least got to be set called why you got a standard and a man's got a right to have a standard in his home come on now and you know I was thinking thinking about spirits that's what you're really doing is you're you're not accepting an evil spirit in your home and and what about your your this home a man's got a right or a woman's got a right to kick the devil out to kick the devil out of your home get all the magazines get all the all the stuff this this the SM the the nastiness of the world get out of your home and get it out of this home too get out of this I I when we were up there in in uh in Ohio we were sitting around and campfire and we got to start talking about ghost stories and you know uh uh we some of us have little pictures of some of the kids have and you know the ghosts are real and some of the kids have pictures of different ghosts and things and different stories and things and and you know what always surprises me is about people that will let a ghost run rampid in their home and they'll just uh we got to talking about that about how that they'll well uh some people we know they they standing at the at at the counter in their house and look over they they feel here's somebody calling them and then they look over and they can see a man's arm or something and and they're like well it's just something that I got to deal with look no no if it's if it's my home the devil's got to get out and if it's if if it's a friend people say well Friendly Ghost I don't care I don't want nothing sitting on my mattress in the middle of the night I don't want nothing coming down the hall I don't want no light shining on the hall I don't want none of that now see that's the same way with your W you put up with all the stuff that the devil puts in in your mind you put up with the evil spirits you put up with this Locust that's riding your back and you can't see it you put up with it and people will actually put up with a ghost in their home I don't understand it but you're not called to put up with stuff you're not called to put up with the devil you're called to cast it out oh that's what that's what church is for church is not for lectures church is for casting out Devils that's what Jesus said in Mark 16 you're called to cast out devils in my name they'll cast out Devils they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and that's what church is it's not for just coming together to drink coffee it's to cast Devils out to die to oursel to yield ourselves so that the spirit can flow in us to have overcoming power and listen I I I don't want to see the Devil Run R riding rough shot over nobody it Grieves any minister to see people afflicted by the devil in their body and sickness to be afflicted in their mind to be afflicted in Soul that grieve somebody to be so Afflicted in their soul to where they they're just a toxic person and they just got to they got to like I was preaching Wednesday night they got to take joy from somebody else and I'm sorry if this offends you preaching like this but listen God ain't called you to be like that God has called you to be nice and gentle and sweet not a mean horrible person but he's called you to be a real true Christian part of this brid Tre tried brid tree with a nine nine fountains pulsing up from on the inside pulsing out pushing up from the roofs to push out the nine fruits and the nine gifts of the Spirit brother that offends me you know brother Bram said that if you can't take correction this is our problem this our problem when we come to church whether than dying out we want to Bow up we want to blow up like a bullfrog well you better not t say nothing to me about what I'm doing you realize I I I I wonder if on the day of Pentecost everybody was blowing up like that well you better not say nothing to me about me paying time you better not say nothing to me about this just blowing up and you know you'll never have Harmony blowing up like that reaction like that reacting God wants somebody that can take can take a little bit of of Correction can take correction by the word and say say in humility lay that Pride down to the side lay that Pride down and die out to yourself instead of letting all that anger and animosity rise up but say Lord if there's anything wrong with me I want it to be cut out you know brother said Elisha was not the robe was not cut to fit Elisha but Elisha was cut to fit the robe and you will never try to cut the word you will never match up with this word by trying to cut the word to match up with you but you've got to match up with the word Elisha has got to be cut and Elisha types the bride Elisha types the bride and so we've got to cut our we we've got to be cut to match the word that's the only way we'll have over coming power that's the over only way we'll be able to enforce the r brother R said he didn't give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but Joshua divided the land of the people is that right and Christ brought the church up to the place to where their possession was made to them was given to them just the Jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order the Joshua of the day puts the church in its order giving to each one gifts places position what is it it's God using each one of us in our own capacity in our own different ways to benefit the body molding us into His Image so we fit in the right place and you see that's what I was preaching on Wednesday night if we're not right in our place if we're not in subjection with the word then that's where that's where you'll find all the imity and strife and divisions and things rising up because one wants to be like the other one wants to sing like the other one wants to preach like the other one wants to do better or I'm better at works everybody's comparing themselves with one thing or the other instead of going back to the word of God the word of God is our measuring post the word of God is our metric not one another you see you all you always get that's that's the pro been the problem down Through the Ages people that that seven thund Doctrine for example everybody trying to find seven men that they can follow after instead of looking to Christ trying to follow after somebody and that's been our problem we always try to find somebody that we can hang on to their coattails and follow in instead of getting a real experience with Jesus Christ for personally for ourselves it's looking back to the word you see that's how you enforce that's how you enforce any claim that's how you can enforce a claim against the devil devil you got to get out is you take it back to the word look back into the mirror of God's word you know this morning you know here I am with this three-piece suit on I look like a a peacock or something and and I you this morning you know you getting ready and you you got we got a full floor length mirror and you can get in front of that mirror and you can look at it and say well well well look uh look at look at how I look maybe you can call your wife over and say come look look at me in this mirror and you know when you look in a natural mirror you start thinking about all the flaw you you look you can't help but see all the flaws I you know I joke around with my kids about how I I I the older I get the I got bags under my eyes big enough to carry groceries in you know you got bags in your knees and and you just you know you you can't help but see the all the frickle the salty salt in your hair you know and you're you're getting old you get the skin spots and and and you you look in a mirror and you you start thinking well there is there anything good to this you know I'm getting a little ball spot on my head I got glasses now I can't hardly see I can't even read without glasses and there's all these faults when you look in a natural mirror and I could I call my wife over and my kids and be like well look at that and what you going to get you're just look you're looking at the outside but on the inside is a soul something that's worth worth more than a a million worlds moreth worth more than all these Galaxy something that's really worth something and you want to find something you want to find what your soul really looks like then you got to go to a different mirror you got to go to the mirror of God's word now see then you you look in a natural mirror and call everybody to look look at that look at look at that and that's that gets a little bit weird doesn't it but you look into the mirror of God's word and you start telling somebody look what this says about me and it takes on a different tone doesn't it it sounds a little bit different when you say look look what the Bible says about me the Bible says that God is going to restore all the things that the devil took away from us the Bible says that anything that I can believe that's written here is mine the Bible tells me don't forget about all these benefits that I got the Bible tells me that by his CR Stripes I'm Healed and the Bible tells me that I'm going to sit with him in his throne I'm going to sit with him in power the Bible tells me I'm a join air with him the Bible tells me that I can overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of his testimony the Bible tells me to come boldly to the throne of grace the Bible tells me that he's he's the high priest of My Confession that anything that I confess that he's my mediator and he'll take it before the Throne of God and act on my behalf to bring the things that I confess coming out of his word to bring them to fruition now see then it takes on a different thing when you start looking at the word and see that's how you get power over the devil look at what the word says stop looking at them bags under your eyes and the salt in your hair and all the imperfections cuz look there's a lot of things that are wrong in our lives there's a lot of imperfections we can look at uh when I I I used to joke every morning when I get on the elevator at work I the elevator door was shut and I'm listen for the popping money because you're getting older and your joints start popping and everything starts falling apart but down inside you there's a soul that God is molding molding In His Image he's molding that inward man that character to be like him oh and if I want to know what I have access to I look into the word of God and I can see so that's all that matters all that matters all that matters is that what Jesus says about me if we could really if that would really fall into our heart all that matters is what Jesus says I reminded that time you know that uh little Rebecca and little Sarah they got up in brother bram's lap and and they were kind of arguing over who you know one of them said well I got all of daddy and a little Rebecca I think it was said it may be that you got all of daddy but I want you to know Daddy's got all of me so if we just get all wrapped up in Jesus it don't matter you know he he's got room enough in his lap for all of us we start poking and everything and but you know all it matters is that Jesus has God us that's the only thing that matters is what Jesus thinks about me amen now listen I'm trying to give you I'm trying to give you like in the greatest battle ever fought brother R said that ministers equip Us and how to get out of the eggshell I'm trying to equip how to get out of the eggshell it does not matter how many friends you got or don't have it does not matter how many likes you get on Facebook it does not matter how many people think that you're good or bad or whatever all that matters is that Jesus has got you all that matters oh you just you're going to go through the Hall of critics I can assure you that you're going to walk through the Hall of critics and what the critics do is they actually manifest they point out that that you are real that you're real and you got to go through the Hall of critics you got to go through the Hall of critics where people say that ain't real that ain't right it ain't for you and all manner of things and and and surely listen some of the young people you you know you get it when you when you go to Camp you you get just bombarded with all this stuff people are horrible on Instagram and whatnot but hold on wait till you grow up because it don't stop the devil continue the devil is there when you're young the devil is there when you're middle-aged the devil is there when you're old probably probably if the Lord carries and and we're old and and still fighting this battle there'll still be people saying horrible saying and doing horrible things but what matters is you keep your eye right on Jesus Christ keep your eye on the word and that'll help you keep your sanity amen amen you don't have to be concerned about what the other fellow thinks brother Brown said don't it don't embarrass me to say I believe every word of God he said it don't embarrass me to say that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost listen everywhere you go you're a witness and I I mentioned earlier that the little girls working at Chick-fil-A people say strange things about why do you wear do you wear a dress all the time you're going to have those critics but then there'll be trickles of people coming through like the other day a little old man came through and said you're a Christian aren't you I could tell you're a Christian see you got to go through the Hall of critics you got to go through all the naysayers and there's people like in the message influence brother said there's people watching you that's something to keep in mind at church people are listening to you slip out them cuss words in the church parking lot people are listen young people are listening to you and let me tell you they will hang on to that for year I remember sister so and so slipped out they'll remember that people are watching you you're an influence to people they are watching the life you live they're watching and brother R said if you know what you're talking about you're not ashamed if you know what you're talking about you're not ashamed I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power of God and the Salvation to everyone that believes and again what am I talking about this afternoon I'm talking about restoring give restoring back the things that the devil's trying to take from you that you don't have to be ashamed the devil try to take your joy and try to take your worship and that's what that's why people can't really worship the way that God wants them to because they're ashamed of it they're ashamed to raise their hand they're ashamed to say Amen in church you know you you go back and see what brother r said he said PE he said if people wouldn't amen me I wouldn't want to preach to them if people wouldn't amen and this message the restoration of the brid tree said if if it was a church when I was preaching my heart out and and people weren't saying sicken boy why would I want to preach to somebody that didn't believe what I was preaching oh you see that's what we're called to a to a Revival a spiritual Revival where we know what we're fighting and we know what we're here for and we're not coming to church just to drink coffee and just to see our friends but to do battle against the spirits of the devil we're not we're not warn against flesh and blood but against powers and and principalities and brother R said it don't embarrass me to say that our Lord has showed me Visions when a man meets God talks to him and the reality of God becomes his in his heart he's not ashamed of it every man in the Old Testament wasn't ashamed of the word and he said if I'm a Christian and been filled with the spirit wearing the testimony of Jesus Christ Resurrection don't let any devil try to push you around don't be ashamed of him in this generation sinful perplexed this sinful adulterous and full of old all putrified sores now listen we got something that we shouldn't be ashamed of amen amen you know I I I used to think maybe this was arrogant but I'd be riding the subway and i' i' you know it'd be jostling and we I'd look around and I think these PE maybe this is arrogant thought to have these people don't realize that there's a Son of God on this train these people caught up in and in and the in in the world you know you see all the ads floating by for for pills and stuff that people can take and yet yet the world is going by and and they're they're not ashamed of their sinful life they're not ashamed of the horrible clothes that they wear that just reveal everything every every dimple and every every fold and every crease they're not ashamed of that but a real son or daughter of God that's clothed in righteousness walking in a dress amongst the world where everybody looks everybody's going to look at you if you wear a dress as a real Christian lady and you shouldn't be ashamed of that you shouldn't be ashamed of your hair that's worn long as a sign that you believe the message of the Angels the Ministries that you've heard that you've heard the word that they're preaching you shouldn't be ashamed with it why because God has given you Liberty and he's given you power to overcome the Devil he's given you overcoming Power by the word that you've heard and you don't have to be ashamed of it you don't have to be ashamed of because you've got joy you don't have to be ashamed because you've got peace in your heart I'd rather have peace in the in my heart than all this nonsense of the filth of the world wouldn't you would you want to have peace in your heart if God has if the devil has robbed you of that peace then it can be restored to you tonight here in the service cuz I believe that God is here brother B said the devil robs individuals of their Joy he said the first fruit of the spirit Brotherly Love is what the devil robs him of he said the Vitality of faith and and God's word is what the devil robs him of he robs him of peace of mind and Assurance the devil aims to create Discord so he's robbing people of their peace he's he's robbing people of a pursuit of a holy life he's robbing them of a spiritual vision and understanding he's robbing them of the ability to grasp and hold on to the truth and he's robbing them of their Assurance you see restoration is not only a past return but is is a present taken hold if we can realize that we could take a hold of it right here right now whatever is laid in God's word we can claim it claim it brother Ram said the law or the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully de deceitfully taken from God and he said if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or a daughter of God we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God I think that's a real Faith Builder right there when the devil starts coming with his Onslaught I I say I like to say a lot in the middle of the night you go back in the prayer lines a lot of times is that's when brother Brandon would say that the devil will onl in the evening it's in the evening when you get nervous it's in the evening when you get frustrated it's in the evening when you can't sleep it's in the evening cuz that's when the devil attacks maybe that parallels in the evening time but listen you don't have to take it you can look look to straight to God's word and God's word will work you've got a right to enforce the claim of God so you don't have to be ashamed you don't have to be lost you don't have to be sinick you don't have to be dejected you don't have to be without hope you don't have to be prideful you don't have to be arrogant and you don't have to be contentious you don't have to be all those things you know what the the wool that the devil pulls over our eyes that he just he just wants to make a deal with us well it's just the way it is I've been sitting beside this pool of Bethesda for years I just I just guessed it's the way it is but one day Jesus come by the the woman with the issue of blood well she' been like that for a long time but that don't make no difference I just I guess I just got to deal with us but you don't have to deal with it see we're not talking about reforming where we just patch things up but we're talking about full restoration full restoration where the devil's taking away all these things all he's what is he taking away the power he's taking away the joy he's taking away the confidence in the word that it will do what it says it does that's what the devil's taking away the faith that's faith is one of the nine fruits of the spirits because what he's taking away the confidence that the word of God will perform like it like it should and he eats it back he eats it down he eats down all the the uh the producing where it produces he eats down to where it's just nothing but just some things that we learn and it don't produce anymore that's what the devil want that's what the devil is trying to do in your life just eat it down until it doesn't produce in your life anymore it's just something that's just laying there in your memory but you've got a right to what what is full restoration to return back to the original teaching to return back to the full access to the nine spiritual gifts to return back to genuine brotherly love to return back to a position where faith in God's word is affirmed to return back to genuine joy and peace to return back to genuine Divine Fellowship to return back to healing through the rights given by Christ sacrific to return back to power and authority over demonic forces to return back to a restoration to an enduring relationship with God that's what I want is a relationship with God to really know him and the power and the demonstration of the do you know that's how the gospel is even supposed to be preached the that's what Paul said the gospel's got to I came not to you with words of wisdom but in the power and the demonstration in other words that it will actually perform it's not just something that we learn and that we recite a book of rules but it will actually manifest that when we come up for prayer and we lay hands on the sick that they actually recover that when we call for the dead to come back that it actually works that when we believe for something when we believe for Sight to be restored spiritual natural it actually works that's what full restoration is oh you remember in the Bible how the in in in in the book of Kings one of the Kings was told that story of the shunamite woman where her her dead son was restored back to life and and Elisha told the woman he said now go after after her son was restored he told her to go and sojourn and and get away because the famine is going to come on the land and she went away and sojourned for seven years but after seven years come back looking for inher her all her property after seven years just like at the end of uh at the end of the seven Church ages in 2 Kings chapter 8 veres 1-6 is where this story is and the woman arose and she did what Elisha told her and she went with all her household and she stayed in the land of the Philistines for seven years but after then seven years it was time for her to get her inheritance by and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land and the King talked with gazi the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha had done and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and gazi said oh my Lord oh King this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life life and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers all the land that she had take it and give it back to her after seven years all that was all all that was hers and look at it like this all that was in the mind of God all that he wanted you to have now at the end of the seven the seven Church ages now is being restored back and look he said not just restore all that was hers but he said and all the fruits all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now so all the land and all the fruits is being restored oh uh there's that's a that's a big promise now all the fruit the fruit of joy and peace and love and and a sound mind you know that's what the devil the devil I've seen people sit in church and the devil will rob them of their peace and they'll sit for maybe 20 years coming up for prayer over and over I wonder getting old getting gray-haired I wonder if I'm really born again and why is the devil robbing you of your peace and and many times it's because of misinterpreted theology they'll look at something that's maybe is presented a little bit off kilter and they'll get it in their head they get it in their head that they can't be saved and they're looking at things from a legalistic standpoint but oh that's what the word had to be preached in truth and power to restore back their true understanding of all these things so that you could have peace in your mind peace to know whether or not you're really born again or not I I God to think to think this afternoon that God wants you to know God wants you to know if you're really and if you're really lost that's what we come to church for to be convicted you know sometimes we we come to church and people get upset I I feel like I'm getting preached on too much well listen it might be because we're trying to get you to see that might there's something off-kilter in your life we're preaching we're preaching something the message not just to build people up like a a a popcorn sermon where a bubblegum sermon where we're getting everybody all pumped up and we can be happy but oh it'd be good to see some real conviction break loose to see somebody really recognize that there's a flaw in their life where they really need God oh that's what the gospel is supposed to be to preach not just not just not just the good things not just a Prosperity Gospel but to preach somebody to a place where they can recognize that they need more of God to where they need something and lay it down lay all that all those weights that so so easily beset us lay down our pride and lay lay all those things that are that the devil's wanting us to pack on our back he said we got a privilege we've got the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to Force these claims upon Satan say give it back and he has to do it right he has to do it now these These are the promises that I laid claim to when when I was seeking the new birth these are the laid promises that I laid claim to for years and years is when the devil begins to assault you with all these things in your mind you just trust what God said I've got a right that gives you a right God's word gives you a right yes it gives you a right to say boo to the devil you know the devil is the biggest bully there is he'll come in like like a like a school Bulet give me everything in your locker that's what he's doing give me all your lunch money give me all your joy and you know just like a bully in school a bully won't back down until you stand up to it that's it's I I've always I've always been fascinated behind the mentality of bullies it's like they just don't have any self-awareness sometimes and you just have to stand up to them to make them back down and that's the same way with the devil you got to say boo back to the devil Sorry Devil you can't have what's in my locker of Joy Sorry Devil I I I don't accept ghosts and Spooks in my house Sorry Devil you're going to have to get out of my house because this is a God-fearing home and I don't want nobody coming in here with with their short shorts and their halter tops you can't come into my house like that you can't come into my house and use it like like a barroom or something you can't come into my house with all your filth of the world but this place is separated that's your natural house and your spiritual house oh we look at things like that you know you separate you you clean up your house clean up the place where you live in that's how you have peace when I come home from like I was talking about when I come home get get off that Subway and come into my home and and like like brother brandom said you come in the door and your wife gives you a big hug and greets you at the door with some lemonade and and and has some supper prepared for you that's what brother brandom said now that's peace and that peace comes from having your home cleaned up and that's Joy you want real Joy have your home cleaned up and the devil kicked out and that's Joy when you you have a sanctuary you got have a sanctuary where you can come home from the things of this world and rest and put your feet up and there ain't all this stuff on the television you ain't all got all this Super Bowl nonsense playing with somebody twisting their hips and everything you ain't got all that trash of the world but you done cleaned it out and then the same way you clean out your life and that'll give you Joy in your heart where you don't have to be nasty and ugly to somebody because you got peace in your heart and that peace in your heart you can translate transmute out to somebody else and give it to somebody else because you got peace right brother Bob this is horrible the way you're preaching yeah but it'll give you power it'll give you power and you know what a real Eagle will like this kind of preaching I I think you know you look in the Bible well let me I'm going to stay off that but listen if the devil took something from you take it back if the devil took your joy take it back if the devil took your peace take it back cuz we've got a holy ghost right to enforce our claim and brother R said the lawgiver the holy spirit is himself is here the agent of God to see that it's done he forces it so maybe tonight as we're going to be closing in a few minutes you could ask this question are you ready for the devil to take his hands off amen now that's a battle in your mind you say we don't like to talk about the devil do you do we but if you're sick it's the devil causing you to be sick if you got a mind battle it's the devil if you're nervous in your mind it's the devil if you don't have peace in your heart it's the devil if the devil's taking any of these things from you it's the devil but if you're ready and believe the devil has to go if you're ready and believe the devil's got to go oh now that see that sets an atmosphere of faith when the atmosphere begins to change where you're looking steadfast at the word of God and and and you begin to meditate on his word and the devil has got to go oh just like just like a evil spirit in somebody's house you start playing we were talking about somebody that did this they bought a haunted house and and they they saw like little boys moving through and all this kind of walking down the hall just weird stuff but they got to play in the the message I just left it playing set the atmosphere set the atmosphere of faith and the devil had to go it didn't hang around too long and listen you set an atmosphere of faith and believing and look at the word of God and and claim it not just half Hazard but really hang on to it hold it in your heart and the devil has got to go now it isn't that revealed in the seals how do you get the devil to go it's the word of God a and the word of not God not just by learning something like you're in a seminary but lay hold and claim it and expect something to happen that's why brother R would say come expecting because we're not coming to church just to just to to to see expect to see how how nice brother Bob got his three-piece suit on or what kind of tie brother Aaron has or or to see whether somebody's going to remember my birthday from behind the pulpit or whether they go how they're going to sing my anniversary song but we're coming to to have to to to we're expecting something we're expect ing that God will move we're expecting a Revival in our hearts we're expecting to be lit up by the word on the inside we're expecting for God to come and turn the light on like nobody else can there ain't no man that can turn the light on there is a man that can turn this light on turn on the revelation of God that'll illuminate and drive the devil out the word of God revealed in a repentant heart will drive the devil out amen are you ready for the devil to take his hands off maybe this afternoon you're sitting here with all these perverted natural desires and we're living in a world an age where the world don't even know what gender they are and and let me tell you there's people in this world in this even in this message that the devil's got in their mind that they're battling out whether they're whether they're gay or straight or whether they're this or that or whether they're whether they're a boy or a girl whether all these things but God wants to drive that devil out and straighten up your mind and straighten up your thinking and you don't have to be a subject to all this filth of this world all the stuff that they got on the internet for you to read about you don't have to be subject to that you don't have to be subject to all the vaping and all the all the clothes and all the drugs and filth the worldly influences of peer pressure but the devil oh are you ready for the devil to take his hands off what are we doing we're creating an atmosphere of Faith where Satan has got to go oh that's what church is all about creating an atmosphere of Faith where the devil is not welcome creating an atmosphere Faith where we know that something's going to happen why cuz the brid tree has got to come forth in restoration all these thing things have to be restored and and to be restored back into the church true power true character true fruits of the spirit and brother Braham said when the tree was planted on the day of Pentecost and he said he brought that tree there for a purpose on the in the Statue of perfect man he said they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications of true character a church with true character he said this tree was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit nine different kinds which means nine fruits of the spirit to go with the nine spiritual gifts that was God's tree he planted it in the Earth on the day of Pentecost how you you think what you know when we go to Costco or Aldi or any of those grocery stores you know you come out with a little basket full of fruit and nine kinds of fruit is a lot you you could have oranges and lemons and and and and uh strawberries and and all kinds of things and and God has given us just like a basket that you come out of the grocery store with he's given us an assortment of all these things to manifest him in and make a real mature church at what is it what is it for a church where other people want to be around amen now that's the character of a real Christian that other people want to be around you the Le the cool leaves that you can crawl up under and get some shelter cool leaves of unity the the wind blowing through and the leaves are shaking and you hear that rustling in the trees uh don't you just love in maybe in the fall or the early spring you throw open the windows and you hear the leaves the wind rustling through the leaves and it just makes you feel home now that's that's what this bride tree is about a bride a bride tree where people feel welcome that they come and they can get shelter and they can get nourishment and they can get some peace and the bride tree and brother R said all nine gifts has got to be working in the church and all nine gifts have a relation to the nine the nine nine fruits they're related why because how you going to have wisdom without love how you going to have knowledge without Joy how you going to have faith without peace how you going to have healing without longsuffering how you going to have Miracles without gentleness and prophecy without goodness and discernment without meekness and everything goes hand in hand that the spirit of God pushing out pushing out all these gifts what it's a supernatural church not a natural and we'll find and and and we'll be closing in just a moment here I'm not going to wear you out this afternoon but brother Bram cautioned over and over stay away from the natural we don't want something natural something cold and formal something where we're just learning about it collecting information but we want a living message we want something that's living something where God is producing that's what I want to see and the nine fruits it what it all comes by the spirit of God just like in Psalm chapter 1 he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper it comes by the spirit so we need the spirit how do we get more spirit and I'm going to close with this if you want more of God if you want more of the SP Spirit more of the spirit moving in your life more of the spirit moving in your church if you want more of God come with an attitude of expectation amen that's right now come on now I'm not trying to be mean but honestly sometimes we come with an expectation to sleep where this is and I know you know it's a it's a good safe environment to get our nap in but if we change that and come with an expect of worship come with an attitude of expectation you know when we got in the car this morning we we come we didn't just come with our minds vacuous just sitting there or even listening to music but we come listening to a sermon this morning you why cuz you're expecting oh and and that set that atmosphere we we were I think we we all had tears running out of our face this morning when we got out of the car cuz we come we come Sunday is is we're coming with an attitude of expectation we're not just treating it like just some in the old days where we can just we're going to get some of that strong coffee at church but we're come come expect expecting something and and and we're coming like a tree what what does a tree do how you how do you going to get more how you going to grow you you keep drinking like a tree that's planted by the river of water I'm I'm I'm instructing this afternoon how do I get more Spirit come expecting amen and keep drinking like a tree just suck it up suck up that word suck up that water the word is the the water that's cleaning us and that's why you know you I I I I wonder sometimes it seems like all we do we go to meetings we just our our our day is just and I ain't trying to brag on my family y'all know that but listen our mind is we're living we're living for the word we we it's all I want is the word and and we just we're I get up in the morning I hear the tape playing downstairs I all all I did yesterday was study study study and it seems like others are not drinking but I want to encourage you to drink if you are drinking and great but if you're not I want to encourage you to keep drinking and you can tell that's how you tell whether there's something real happening in somebody's life if they don't want the word there's something there's something wrong with that tree if they're not excited about the word listen I'm sorry for laying it out through straight and narrow but if you don't love the word if you don't love this message there's something wrong with your tree if you don't love it cuz that's how you grow and when you're born again something that on the inside changes to where it begins drawing you to the word and you got to have that word like a tree and you you're going to want that tree you don't to want that water you don't to want the water you you you can't you can't get away from it like a tree you a tree without water that's why standing outside you hear all the oldtimers we need rain we need rain cuz the trees are going to die if you don't get rain everything's going to die if you get don't get rain you got to have that water how do you want how do you get more of God surrender and yield yourself surrender die out to yourself and say Lord if there's anything wrong with me lay aside all our pride and all that Bo up well bless God you better not tell me nothing if we'll lay aside all that to where we can be told something then something will begin to happen in our lives and put all your dependence on the word of God all of your dependence pray and seek God's presence and walk in faith in positive confession and cultivate a desire for more of God and drink drink that water maybe we'll close with this you know a mature oak tree can consume 40,000 gallons or more per year 40,000 gallons that's 110 gallons a day just soaking up that water you put an oak next to a river a spring and it's just going to drink it all up as much as you can give me that's as much as I can take and you know I believe that that's a real Eagle that's that's the eagle anointing give me as much as you give me as much as meat as you can give give me as much water as you can give and I'm going to drink it up because that's what I need to survive and if you keep drinking you can't help but produce fruit you keep drinking and drinking and soaking it up and soaking it up and it's going to push out push out and push out and push out push out a loving peaceful gentle Meek life it's going to push out the character of Jesus Christ it's going to push out something real it's going to push out the devil it's going to be like that stature of a perfect man pushing out all the trash pushing it out all washing all that trash out until a genuine real character is revealed amen it's going to bring forth God's fruit in the season that the messenger is ordained to come and every every age God has ordained fruit God has ordained his word to be manifested what is it as the musicians come the fruit is a product of eternal life eternal life is down in the root of that tree and it pushes up and pushes up by drinking drinking drinking until it just pushes out a product of eternal life oh that's what I want to see as the as the product of eternal life working working in my life working in in Believers lives and all these worms all these spiritual things eat it down but God promised I will restore we got a promise there laying in the scripture that we can look at I will restore I wonder I wonder as we stand to our feet as a musicians maybe start playing softly maybe think this this afternoon is there what what has the devil taken from you what has the has the devil taken your joy has the devil taken your meekness your gentleness has he taken that Gentle Spirit Away From You has he taken your peace where you're wondering what's up and what's down maybe he's taking everything from you you know you can have it back the Bible says the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil he said I will restore to you all those years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God oh that means that true worship be be restored you know you can't worship you can't worship right unless you're in God's provided place of worship when Jesus was talking to that little woman at the well she said we don't we worship over here in this mountain where where are you telling us to worship and he said the true worshipper will worship in spirit and in truth oh that's when true worship is restored when true truth is restored when you know what you believe in when you know that you've got it oh that's when you can really worship like Miriam when she come come across the Red Sea and she saw all those Egyptians washed away behind she took that tambourine out and she began to Rejoice oh church we got something to Rejoice about I wonder tonight if you if you need restoration why don't we just bow our heads bow our heads
