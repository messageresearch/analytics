brother Dale and even be with sister Peggy Lord father God as she's there trying and helping him Lord just bless her Lord strengthen her as well we just commit ourselves now into your hands and we ask you these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord Saints Oh if the brothers could just bring up the the scripture amen so we're gonna read from the from first Peter chapter 2 first Peter chapter 2 verses 9 through 17 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy wonderful things we have the the the things that God says Thaksin says about us and that Peter talks about here but watch what these people have to do dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify God in the day of visitation now watch this submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake even you don't have to agree with it but for the lord's sake submit unto it whether it be to the king as supreme or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of God that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of God verse 17 honor all men not some man not the ones that you like not the ones that do you good not the ones that shake your hand it says honor all man love the other hood all right fear God and honor the king and all these things that that Peter is talking about here in verse 17 has to do with respect and Submission amen so that's what I want to talk about this evening about the power of respect and submission so you may have as your seats to see me praise God so the brothers could bring up a little slide the little slides you know Saints lately about two weeks ago when brother Bob was preaching as a matter of fact I was back in the back and there was something I don't know it was something that he said or I can't remember exactly what it was but but it was uh and something just came to my mind and it took me back to that message that brother Branham preached called respects and if you'd haven't listened to its 1961 it's called respects and a really good message where he talks about how respecting in this respect and took place in the scriptures and the consequences of it or the or the blessings thereof and so in the last several weeks just the Lord has been dealing with me on this on this line and really Saints if you take a look at it because in the Indy and then in them in today's and the day that we live in all we see is disrespect everywhere there's no respect for authority I mean you drive you that Drive you know you you see the disrespect if you just go right here and just drive down here down down nine eighty five you'll just see that this respect I mean people are just disrespectful everywhere and and and this just become a common thing in people's lives and so it becomes also it's such is so common in people's lives that it also comes in and infiltrates in the inside the church and we come and we disrespect one another not not desiring to but we do it and we don't even know that we're doing it and the whole scripture from Genesis to Revelation talks about it is we'll bring it up in just a moment but it is one of the center themes of the Bible as a matter of fact Redemption because we know that Redemption is is the whole core of the word redemption couldn't even have happened if there was no respect or submission involved do you see what I'm saying so respect is a very important thing if the world out there does it and they're not even believers without the Holy Spirit people people do it how much more the believer who supposed to be filled with the Holy Spirit who has the author of respect and submission in us how much more shouldn't we do it and so we engage in all kinds of disrespect even amongst us we engage in all kinds of disrespect and we do not even realize it and I and and really if you think about it if we're created in the image of God and if we're sons and daughters of God and that that life of God is in you and I now I got a quote for this where the Browns said that if is if you disrespect one another you're disrespecting God that's a direct quote from God from it from brother Branham so so let's just look at this here and that I hope that you learn something and not just learn it but it would help you to apply into your into your daily life and I would ask you all there just be respectful this evening and listen please if you're falling asleep shake it off and because that's just respect for me do you see what I'm saying that's just respect for me and it's respect for the Lord amen because I believe that God has something for each and every one of us I know that some you know we need to hear these things from from time to time Paul covered them brother Branham covered it so I believe that we need to cover it so so let's just look at this here in the power of respect and Submission go to the next next one so let's just look at a couple of quotes here and not just quotes from brother Branham but the brother branham said the only way that you can respect God is to respect one another the only way now confucius said without feelings of respect what is there to distinguish men from beasts without you having that sense of respect because even even and I kind of thought about that but even animals respect one another I heard one time I was listening to something recently and there was a there was a somebody speaking about the Eagles in in Montana and how when they go and fish for salmon and stuff like that they actually wait till the salmon actually spawns before they actually go and get the salmon to eat there's a respect there even from the animal kingdom yet when we go by each other we don't even say anything to each other somebody's sick somebody needs some help somebody needs and we just I got to go to the car I got to do this that and the other oh you got a little quiet but that's true we need to respect one another I speak to everyone in the same way whether he is in the in the guard whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university Albert Einstein said this one of the smartest men in the world respect is one of the greatest expressions of love miellyn Hilary's submission is not and this is one about submission submission is not about Authority and it's not obedience it is all about relationships of love and respect so that is some notable quotes and if we can we can go to the next slide now the theme of respect and Submission is throughout the entire Bible as I just mentioned it and the core of the word is Densham but there cannot be any redemption unless there's respect and Submission involved and I have Jesus Christ here because that's the ultimate of risk that shown respect and yet submissive he didn't want to die this is like any other man he even he even tried to see if he could get out of it as a man he prayed to God and he said lord if this cup can pass from me but let it be not my will but thy will be done and he submitted to the will of God that was a hard thing to go through I don't think any man none of you have ever gone through anything like he did that was the hardest thing that you could ever to think that you're gonna die for all humanity for the sins of all humanity and and and yet you you were sinless you were spotless and you were being punished for something that you didn't even even do accused of things that you didn't even do and yet he was he was taking all that for you and I because he was thinking about some of us he died for the whole world but he knew who he was down for for sure Amen Philippians 2:8 says and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross amen next slide since Jesus Christ is the word and how many can can you all see this in the back I don't know if I need to turn off lights here but okay if you can't see it just let me know and if you want a copy of this and be more than glad to give you a copy since Jesus Christ is the word he was the ultimate example of respect and Submission even when he was incredibly disrespected first Peter 2:23 who when he was reviled revolved not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously you know to the man to regular common man we think you know when we think in the lines of the Old Testament tooth for a tooth eye for an eye and we like that us and our natural mind oh yeah I like it they do it to me I'm gonna do it to them but that's not what Jesus Christ didn't remember he's the ultimate of submission and respect amen hmm the next slide appreciate the brothers in the back so what is respect respect is a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities qualities or achievements do regard for the feelings wishes rights or traditions of others in other words if you see something a different way or if you grew up in a different way just because you grew up that way doesn't mean that the other person they grew up on the side of the world doesn't mean that they're wrong you see just because you grew up here in the South doesn't mean that the one that grew up out west is wrong doesn't mean that the one that grew up in Mexico or the one that grew up in Colombia because your tradition that's your tradition and I must respect that tradition just as much as you need to respect mine do you see praise God respect also means to acknowledge someone their labors or even their presence I'm shocked that so many times that you're in a room with somebody and they don't even acknowledge that you're there and most importantly if it's an elder the Bible actually talks about elders if you disrespect elders they would stone people who would disrespect elders elders need to be respected in the higher in a higher way they may not you know you may not agree with them and you may you may not you may not be friends with them but there's a certain reverence that goes that goes towards them when you're around them I'm talking to everybody there's a certain river I grew up learning it was just a common-sense thing that when you come around around an elder or somebody older than you oh god bless you or hello shake their hand but I'm shocked at somebody you go around some people now days and they just don't even go there Mary wait all right I understand you don't want to shake my hand you don't want that that's fine but when an elder gets around you that's a different story they deserve respect they deserve that you deserve honor all right what is respecting the feeling or act by which you show someone how valuable they are to you so when you don't respect somebody when when I go around brother Zack and I don't you know and I'm clearly in front of him and I don't shake his hand I'm trying what I'm saying or why I'm conveying to him is that your feelings don't matter to me you were no value to me I don't care if you're right there this is exactly what you're portraying without saying it without saying and that's a disrespect to God because he was created in the image of God he was created in the image of God she was created in the image of God he's created in the majora every one of us in here including the unsaved person was created in the image of God and they deserve just as much with respect as he does he does but the Bible says and we're ready here just a little bit that more the ones in the household of faith because why their brethren they have the same spirit that you and that you should have a man to see honor see potential to show honor praise God you know we grow up and we hear you must respect your elders you must but it just becomes a mantra the golden rule and all these things but when you actually start looking at these things in the Bible and then you actually look at how the Jews see these things impressed me the things that I have found out in the last several days and and it's challenged me and I hope it challenges you tonight I want to be more respectful because I have many times I've failed in this area I've filled in and I just because brother Boyd was MIT has been preaching about revival Amen that that's an element of revival if you're not respecting one another don't expect the revival if you're you you may read the word you may you may study you may pray but if you come to tried the house of God disrespecting one another joking around one another making light of each other and things like that you are not good don't expect the revival but I believe God wants to give us a revival I believe God I believe God is working in each and every one of us Amen and we get that individual revival Amen and if it expresses itself on the outside out here and somebody gets up shouts dance speaks and Tugg praise the Lord for that - hey man I know that's not the revival but hey you know we need that sometimes praise God alright next one and now what is submission submission is the action or fact of accepting or yielding to a superior force or to the will or authority of another person or entity amen and to obey as well because this can this can be this can be nice but that it can also be not no not nice so Luke 1:38 says and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to that word a man she didn't understand what the angel was head said she and she was trying to reason it out because why he had never happened before that's why she wasn't struck dumb when she asked the angel you know why why is how can this happen yet yet John the Baptist dad was because that had already happened before in Sarah and Abraham and he was questioning it but here's Mary this had never happened before but she just said be it unto me according to that one amen so that's what submission is just submitting yourself and then giving yourself yielding yourself and obeying a man next one how many are still with me amen respect and Submission is directly linked to life what's Genesis 1:27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so they are in his image all right every man that was created every man on the face of the earth is created in God's image therefore every man needs to be respected some have levels of respect a man that you give but every man deserves a respect again you may not agree with them I don't agree with everything that mr. Trump uh does or anything like that but I respect him as a person and I respect him for the position that he holds right you know some point in time one point in time I didn't understand that because when I was looking at I I got caught up back in the early 2000s but you know after 9/11 took place and all that with you know the government things and conspiracy things and stuff like that and I started becoming very rebellious towards the government towards things in life in general and I had to I had to come to myself and shake myself and say Lord this is not your Holy Spirit as much as true that some of that stuff could be but it's not leading me to you and I had to shake it off I had to completely shake it off because it was it was causing me to disrespect the government authorities and thoughts stuff like that and and a lady assist I was preaching that brother Benny parish church one time in South Carolina and she came to after the service and and she was taller talking about how the the local government was so corrupt and how something about the water system and all that stuff and I said I said sister listen I've been through and I know exactly what you're going what you're thinking and what you're experiencing I've been there done that matter of fact Satan is trying to bring you through a rabbit hole right now all right and if you're not careful you're gonna end up like those people out there protesting and all that kind of stuff and it's absolutely anti-god it's absolutely anti anti holy spirit for I I don't see a true born-again Christian out there protesting and stuff like that let God deal with thing do you have to think about that what's happen ever is happening on earth it's because God is allowing it I know only to fulfill his word and to prepare his bride you see so just just whether he uses the government or a jihadist from the Saudi Arabia it doesn't matter to me but God's fulfilling his word that's the most important thing how do I get to that from the image of man to Jay hottest in Saudi Arabia now in the Torah the Jews firmly believed that life should be respected no matter if it's human life animal life or plant life and watch this this is because all life comes from God and life is a gift to all living beings to them if you go and and and and and to a lot of people if you go and tear a leaf from from a tree that's a disrespect to that leaf disrespect to that tree because that was life you see and for us it's not nothing but to something some people that's life our life comes from God so there's a level of respect there doesn't mean I won't do it but I'm just saying you know that's what they believe Genesis 9:6 whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed now I want you to look at this God did not say that whoso sheddeth man's blood I will shed that man's blood no he didn't say that he was saying the consequence of that if you said man's blood your blood is going to be shed as well for in the image of God made He Man all right so there's a respect that must go a man when when and we'll look at Cain and Abel here in just just a moment Cain was complete disrespect to his brother of course he did what he what he did next all right now first Peter we just now got to got done reading so here I'm not going to talk about this too much but Peter refers to us being us chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people and the people of God and we jump and shout and scream whenever we hear those verses we love them oh yeah praise God because we are that is us that is us but then watch what Peter continues to saying yet what these wonderful statuses comes the responsibility to demonstrate respect and Submission you can be all of this but if you don't respect and submit what is all that what is all that t you can know all mysteries and not have love what does all that can do for you you see first Peter 2:13 says submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake now obviously Saints there is there is things that you know the abortion you know we don't agree with that I don't you know I think that that's taken a life you know and there's there's ordinances I mean I can go in there the difference between laws ordinances and and and the different there's another one there is well legislation I think or something but Peter here is talking about ordinances being maybe local ordinances because ordinances being local locally you see that's what paint laws that we follow locally here in the city of Lula those are ordinances but they must obey they must go by the higher law of the land they can't overrule the higher law of the land you see so every law is submitted to every other law to the supreme law which is the constitution and you see there's God next next one and Peter continues saying for so verse 15 for so is the will of God that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish man in other words you may not agree as I'm driving down the road and then that it says I need to go 70 miles of hours at 70 miles per hour that's the speed limit I don't agree with that sometimes I feel like I can easily go 80 or 85 right and some of you are laughing because you know it's the truth but you know what as much as safe as it is for me to do it the law states that I cannot go past 70 right therefore if somebody else if I have a brother with me or somebody else from out another country that's riding with me and I'm going 85 on a 70 mile per hour zone he or she knows that I've become a stumbling block to them technically you have you're disobeying this scripture all right so obeying every ordinance for the sake of for the sake of the Lord right that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish man or look at that they believe they believe that that and the other but I can't put my finger on there man they they they really do what they say they obey the law they they respect one another but I don't agree with what they believe but I did I respect them in any way so you see that's what Peters talking about as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of militias but as the servants of God see we're all we were we were chosen generation a royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people the people of God but we are the servants of God all right honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king amen next slide all right now in looking at that word honor the word honor is in the Greek there in that previous verse that we just read there is the word team out which means properly assigned value as it reflects the personal esteem value preciousness attached to by the but by the beholder now we saw the same word being used when Jesus said in Matthew 15 for for god commanded saying honour died father and mother it's the exact same word go back to the previous slide brother honor all man next next slide honor thy father and mother it's the exact same word it's properly assigning value see so when you as I'm talking to our young people I'm talking to children when you dishonor your mom and dad that God for first and foremost God created God put here on this earth so they're created in the image of God next they were placed there to watch over you as you are growing up right we discussed this a little bit on Saturday on the under and the youth during the youth study that we had but the other thing is is that you have they have of you they have a value they have to have a value in your eyes whether they are wrong or not whether you disagree with them or not they are they have a certain value and then once you once you dishonor them you're taking that value in other words in your eyes that value is not there for them and it can be you can be any sort of dishonor in any sort of dishonor talking back to them talking about them tricking them lying to them disobeying them that is all forms of dishonor to your parents and I could just the list could go on more being sneaky hiding things from them again I told you young people I said that if God loves you every sneaky thing that you do God will find out God God will make sure that it's revealed and I'll be the first one to say amen to that as I was growing up why because God loved me and I was not going to get away with anything that would dishonor my parents and I made sure that I didn't get away but you know what thank God that I grew up in a home where my mom and dad you know I I may have done things and I may have done wrong but my I had some praying parents and I would not be in the place where I'm at if it wasn't for for their prayers obviously God through them amen amen I think a lot of us can say the same payment exact say it's the same thing as well next slide you have to remember your parents are always praying for you and if they're not shame unto them but I believe that they are I believe that your parents are praying for each and every one of you most importantly for your soul that's the most important thing so everything that we do or say exhibits respect or disrespect I just want to give go through just a few examples and just kind of say so quick about it look their respect was shown the Shunammite woman towards Elijah Elijah came to her and say hey give me to eat and she only had just a little bit of oil and a little bit of meal but to make a long story short she gave all that up because of the position and the respect and the honor for that prophet and you know what that cost it calls for her to never have that meal barrel to go empty and for that oil that cruse of oil to never go empty and not only that I believe was the same woman that caused a resurrection for her son who had died the prophet Elijah at the time respected her because he she respected him he had the word of the Lord and so now here's another here's here's a disrespect example in the Bible Marian and Aaron criticized Moses his wife he married a woman that was of another country but God was the one who put them together God was the one who put who caused that marriage to take place when there was and there was and so to Moses now watch this to Moses he it didn't seem like he cared I mean it doesn't seem like in the Bible that he cared Miriam and Aaron were criticizing his wife for what she was but it mattered a lot to God because it was a total disrespect to Moses and his position his office as a prophet because when you were talking about him or his wife you were talking about him you see that's how God saw it respect another another example respects the serf Phoenician woman in the crumbs of it that story is that woman had a daughter that when he was vexed with the devil she needed she was she had a demon genius that he she came to her ask him for Jesus to come and heal her he said no I'm not I'm not supposed to throw the bread to the dogs sounded like a disrespect but he knew what he was talking about because that was the only way to get her from saying yes but at least the dogs eat from the master from the crumbs of the master table if he wouldn't have said that she wouldn't have said that wonderful phrase that we all love and to cause her to receive the healing for her for her daughter and of course this respect Cain kills brought his brother Abel Abel was just serving God and was doing exactly what God revealed to him to offer a sacrifice of bloody sacrifice on the altar but because of jealousy and because of disrespect towards his brother we know Cain killed Abel so it was a disrespect and God took it as a disrespect because even his blood the Abel's blood was crying from the ground and even in that disrespectful act God still try to give Ken a chance and he's still disrespected God it was completely ousted yeah that's why I'm saying Saints and we're look at this in the moment the more you keep disrespecting the more you keep indulging in this respect and thinking that you're right and that you're in the in the disrespecting II everywhere you go everyw where do you go you will not get ahead in life I promise you that because it's all over the word and the word is our absolute you will not get ahead in life Matthew 7:12 says therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you this is Jesus's own words that you should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets you want somebody to treat you nice you come home from work husbands and you want your wife to - - to treat you kind to treat you nicely well how would you treat me here the night before see now I say husbands first because I'm a husband all right how are you treating your wife for you to come home and expect for her to have a cooked meal and to just come home and give you a hug and and just rub your hair and just oh honey I'm so glad that you know when you are disrespecting her all weekend long don't expect that all things whatsoever all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do ye even so to them that's that's logical yes like brother Dale says that's sensible amen next slide we must fear the Lord respect others and love the Brotherhood proverbs 9:10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom now this fear a man is not I'm afraid of God because he's gonna strike me with a lightning bolt no it's a respect and a reverence towards God and towards his word and towards his people cuz remember what brother Brown said when you disrespect his people you disrespect God that's not a fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom you want wisdom in your life start fearing God start respecting his word start respecting his people start respecting his ways if you want to get ahead in life and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding first peter 2:17 we were cocky putting this because honor all man and I love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king Ephesians 5:20 21 says given thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God I can't submit to her she just gets on my nerves every time I'm around her submit submit be humble amongst one another be meek amongst each other remember if for no other reason it's because she was created in the image of God all right respect honor all man next slide what kind of power comes with respect let's just look at these things here for just a moment respect is a gift to another and it is not earned sometimes people say say there they get they got to earn my respect no they don't you you show respect either way I don't care a brother weight is completely disrespecting me but I still show him a respect because not respecting what he's doing to me but I'm respecting him as a human being there's a sense of respect there but also as a brother in Christ there's got to be a respect there as well you see it doesn't matter what anybody has done to you there's got to be a level of respect I may not agree with them and you don't have to agree with her but you must show that a level of respect for who they are respect is an investment it will get you good interest terrible interest or no interest if you give show respect amen there will be something come out of that I have never seen anybody that shown respect that nothing good has come out of it in my whole life in my life myself growing up going through college and getting married and all these things every moment that I've shown respect it always comes back to me and I believe that you can say the same thing but what doesn't come back to you is when you show disrespect as a matter of fact that actually hurts you it actually hurts you more respect is a seed that ultimately creates a good harvest and that's kind of like respect as an investment respect is a weapon it's an easy weapon that you and I can easily use to get to get what we need out of life right it can get you a job it can get your position it can get you favored for from the people in furtherance in the word Amen when I first started coming here to the church I did not understand everything that was being preached and I had been coming here since 2003 and and and you know I was serving the Lord but every time I'd come here I'd sit back there in the back kind of like when my wife's sitting and I just fall asleep like just like some of you do and I'm not saying that I don't fight it I still fight it but I'd be back now I'm talking about completely dozing dude I mean how many mother I just didn't understand what brother Dale was saying I just didn't understand it when we started coming here in 2014 and I said and this was my sincere prayer I said Lord helped me to understand your word not for my sake but for the sake of my family that I may be a better father that I may be a better husband and they might I understand your ways and God granted that for me amen amen why God saw the level of respect that was in my heart God knows each and every one of your hearts amen respect is a fortress it's solid you can never you can never show too much respect you can never show too much honor and respect to anyone and respect creates a positive environment amen whether it's in your home Church workplace it could create a revival in you it always creates a positive environment now I don't know if you could say see this or not but watch what you respect will come toward you and what you don't respect will move away from you I want to say that again because that's very important what you respect will come toward you and what you don't respect will move away from you I I see this I see this and I'll talk about this here in just a moment but you see this amongst amongst children and parents when there's a level of disrespect right there between the children and the parents both coming from the parent to the child or the child to the parent you watch and see if that that if that child will not start hating hating you or even even loathing you being around you I've seen it in the past why because every time they come around you it's like alarm is coming to them there's alarms you know sounding whenever you're around you because you've shown a level of disrespect to them they have just as much opinion in their Mareike to their opinion as you and as the parent does I have to allow my daughter to to speak especially now as she's in her teenage years because right now to them that they're growing and it's like a scaffold that that's you know it looks messy you see I understand you and I have been there and done day it doesn't look good it doesn't mean we don't we we don't see the end result whereas they're going through teenage years but believe me they mut their that God is doing something in them they must go through those times they must go through those times so all we have to do Saints is just for those of us who have teenage children or those about to have teenage children the best thing that you can do you can't you can't tell them to to stop doing a certain thing that as a teenager it's normal for them to do we get we get I wouldn't you know when and when Bella started questioning things you know regarding whenever I would talk to her now she's questioning not questioning the word or nothing like that but now she she could she challenges me now we're in the passage that she hasn't but that's a normal reaction from a teenager that that helps them to up to to cope with people later on in life with you know challenges and stuff like that that's a normal reaction and the best thing that you can do is just channel that in a different way not go against it but just channel it and you will keep the favour of your child so what you what your respect will come towards you and I've seen this in my life Saints the more that I respect my children the more that they will come to me the more I disrespect them the less that they don't want to be around me and those that are planning on getting married remember these things as well next slide so are there consequences that come from this respect this respect is also a seed it will produce a bad harvest or no harvest I put the little kitty there no - is he being respectful disrespectful I don't know maybe he has something and some food in his mouth that he doesn't like kind of put that in there cuz I know things are kind of tense right now and get you get you to laugh a little bit this respect conveys this interest towards others it means that you are no value to me when you're around them this respect leads to loss of relationships separation divorce hatred towards each other the majority of the divorces I believe that taking place and when they continue to take place is because they don't respect one another husbands and wife don't respect one another this respect is not the nature of God there is no place for it in a believers life this respect never gets you ahead in life well no give you a no job no favor from others and no furtherance with God this respect can become a habit it can become a difficult habit to cut loose from again the more we do it the more that we think that we're not doing wrong I come over here and I start making fun of each and every one of you of the defects and things like that and calling you out in the middle of the congregation and things like that that's a disrespect no matter what kind of defect you might have that's a disrespect to the brother to the sister and to God you must not do that because you quench the Holy Spirit trying to work when you come up here joking and stuff like that and calling each other things and stuff like that that you're not supposed to again what you respect will come toward you what you don't respect will move away from you next next slide alright how can you start applying respect and Submission in your own life let's look at self-respect real quick first Corinthians chapter 6 verses 19 know ye not your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and you are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods that's why when Satan comes around and then this happens a lot to younger people saying comes around says I'm just not pretty I look at my hair I got pimples all over my face and I can't get I can't do and and you know what the spirit of depression starts coming on even young Peter belacan Bella can tell you she goes to public school she's she's got friends with full-blown depression on their life and I tell her I tell her it's a spirit they come to her you know to try to get counsel from her and stuff like that I said but you'd be careful that thing will come on you it's hard to get rid of that but the Ryan you you you you know and sister Gabby you you know therefore glorified got it so so you as a person you have to think I'm made in the image of God and it doesn't matter right now I may look this way but I'm still made in the image of God I may have this certain defect but I'm still made in the image of God God created me for his purpose and if I filled with the Holy Ghost amen you're you're more beautiful than anybody else here on this on this art on the earth seven over seven billion people here on this earth amen you're one of the most beautiful amen visions 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them hey man there's no sense in a Christian there's no need for a Christian amen to have to accept the devil's lies about what they look like and things like that amen there's things that we can do to try to help mediate that that's your choice but you're still made in the image of God and then next slide how can you start applying respect and submission in the home life let's look at vision look what Paul says here Ephesians 6:1 through four children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right that's just the right thing Oh your parents love that get him brother Luiz get him yeah honor thy father and mother right which is the first commandment with promise we already looked at this honor thy father and mother that it may be well with the endowments live long on the earth that's not the only verse that talks about this there's many other verses in the Bible in Proverbs Psalms that talks about long life when you fear God when you do when you fear his word when you fear God's word you will see this in the word and you will say oh my I want to obey that and as you obey your parents I've told my daughter's this as you obey us you're obeying God you're obeying God but watch what verse 4 says and ye father's that word father's it means both husbands and wives babies most mothers and and fathers and he father's provoke not your children to wrath provoking them causing them to stir an anger in them that if they disagree with you or they can't you or they every time they want to have a serious conversation with you just joke about it that's not right that's absolutely not right and therefore that's why some were young people they just rebel and they and to them they think that everybody else is against them everybody is against them why because you've shown us a disrespect to you to your own children and you father's provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord I want to sit down with my children and have a conversation with them I don't want to just dialogue with them and then just talk to them and they don't say nothing back to me because they don't say nothing back to you because they're accepting what you're saying but down deep in their heart that they're hiding that and you're saving it for later on and one day you will you will regret their as exactly what they're doing you dialogue with your children you talk back to them and then and and said this respect when you when you constantly just keep the word you're constantly there do you like to be around somebody they're just always in your face and just constantly talking and never let you talk how many love that none of us like that well what do you think your young people your children that's the exact same thing dialogue with them and in that in that dialogue I meant with with seasoning seasoned words and things you know and and it's a friendship that's how you got to treat your you and your children as friends as friends this respect will lead to bitterness and resentment amongst the family next one next slide Oh Oh respect between husband and wife Ephesians 5:22 33 wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's as unto the Lord submit I may not agree but I'm gonna submit why because of mission is power amen I don't see his point but I wanted so I'm gonna submit for the sake of the Lord for the Lord's sake right for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ see we like that we we like that we're subject to Christ you know we are certainly subject to Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything in everything I didn't say God said that do you believe Paul had the Holy Ghost then it was God through the Paul saying it and everything even if it does if you don't agree with it now obviously in brother branham brought question-and-answers if he's leading you to worship other gods or not coming to church or or things like that that's a different story but in things of life amen you should submit to everything now what husbands love your wives alright husbands love your wives why does it say love because that's what women need that's what our sisters need they need love they need to know husbands they need to know that you are there for them the immediate reaction that we have as husbands when something goes wrong and they come to us complaining sweetheart I just you don't know the kind of day that I had today these children they just all over the place and I can't take it anymore and I can't what's the first thing we want to do well well this is what you need to do why don't you do more of this why don't you do that then the other our first instinct is to try to fix things because that's the instinct of a man we want to fix things well that's not that's not me and you know I if I don't fix it I'll make it worse but but that's why is that so funny I hope it's helping somebody hope it's helping a couple because yeah Saints it's the truth you got to love your wife your your wife is not there wanting to get rid of fix everything all she wants is that you're out there listening to her and say honey I'm here for you I love you I love you yeah I love you that's all she needs and with that you've done much more than sitting there trying to give a checklist of what you got to do this is what you got to do do this that day and then this and this will happen that's not gonna work it never has hasn't worked for me if it works for you great but it doesn't work for me you just be right there for your wife listening to her and that's loving her husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself the way you take care of yourselves husbands the way you would not go out you know and then you make sure that you got your deodorant on and you're that you're showered and and you take care of your of your body that's how you gotta take care of your wife do not leave her you know there's so much disrespect among husbands and wives one want one of them is over there the other one's over here and and I see it you go to restaurants and what nowadays this is what you see you watch them one of them is on their phone across from them the other ones on their phone and they're supposed to be having a date that is a disrespect to each other that's that's a total disrespect and in society is leading you to do that and you're allowing them to do it God created us to fellowship with one another I didn't get married to my wife to be on my phone constantly I got married to my wife they when I'm around her I want a fellowship with her and she wants to do the same with me amen praise God so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband see it doesn't say that that that the wife loved a husband cuz we really don't need that we know that you love us I know that you love me sweetheart I don't really need to for you to tell me I need to tell you because that's what women need but look how Paul says that see that the wife revans her husband you know what reverence is is respect it's respect all what what a man wants is respect you respect your husband you may not agree with him and everything but you respect him for the position that he holds on my we're going let's go next slide I respect in the church life Philippians 2 2 to 4 fulfilled me my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind being a one Accord in one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind in other words humility let each esteem other better than themselves you should I should see brother Wade esteem him better than my needs when he's around me I'm here to serve Him where the Dawn's around me I'm here to serve as a matter of fact that's what a minister is is one that serves it's not one that kicks you in in submission and doesn't know it's one that serves I'm here to serve each and every one of you alright that's what a minister is but alone ease of mind let each esteem other better and so look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others this is a direct commandment from God 1st Thessalonians 5 12 to 13 and we beseech you brethren to know them which labor among you in other words to recognize them that labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work safely that's a respect that's a respect but the weight may preach something I may disagree with it right may because God hasn't revealed that to me I don't know but that doesn't mean I go disrespecting or sit there at the bench just looking at him you just wait until I preach no that's a total disrespect it's disrespectful and it's disrespectful to God and be at peace among yourselves the the whole thing is to be at peace amongst each other you know doesn't matter what we've done to one another the past is the past we're seeking peace amen we're seeking peace next slide Hebrews 13:7 I remember them which have the rule over you you have spoken unto you the Word of God and we know Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever remember them respect them Ephesians 5 1 through 4 be therefore followers of God as dear children let's just go down to verse 3 but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as become Saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting I do say that the word says that joking around in the church and cutting up and and and and making light of one another that's not right that's a disrespect and God will deal with it jesting which are not convenient Paul says but rather giving of thanks it just makes you look bad when you send they're making fun of everybody you know when you send they're joking joking the Aerie everything that comes out of your mouth is a joke about somebody you know what that makes you look cheap and you know what people are gonna disrespect you the same way so it's not convenient and it doesn't help anybody because behind the every joke there's a truth but in other words behind every little thing that you might say you might say to brother ray you know or something like that about his heighth or something like that behind it there's a truth there's the truth of what's in your heart or what you think or what am I say about brother Marcos AK or whoever there's a truth behind that and it's a disrespect to God nextslide respecting the church life sometimes you can be disrespectful and not know that you are being disrespectful and you can think I'm just being honest with you because we think we are being dishonest if we don't express our true feelings let me just be honest with you when somebody says that to me Who am I and get away what in the world's got to come out of their mouth you know we got we don't always have to be right about everything we don't always have to be right there's some times that it's okay for somebody to be right and you're wrong it's fine that's good you there's times that that needs to happen you don't always need to be right about everything and just because it's the truth doesn't necessarily mean that it's always the right thing to go to the person and tell them that sometimes it's better just to let God deal with it let pray about it and let God do the work familiarity begins to lessen respect when we are around each other all the time we become less respectful that's the truth every time if we if we're constantly around each other that increases the chance of disrespecting one another and you see this amongst family you see this amongst amongst people constantly there's a constant disrespect why because they're always with each other it's good to be with each other but you need to practice it respecting one another now I'm not saying you can't joke around and stuff like that but when it's something that's off-color and something that it's not right that's a disrespect I mean I'm gonna be the first one to tell you I love joking around I love messing around love laughing because that's my makeup somebody called me one time and I believe his sister truly this smiling prophet I don't know somebody said that but you know I didn't like the Prophet part but but or no it was somebody that used to come to church here sorry sister Trudy sorry I guess because I'm smiling a lot well praise God praise God you know I like to laugh I like to smile making light of one another in derogatory ways is disrespectful and it quenches the moving of the Spirit is that the truth or not I don't think I'm saying anything that's wrong that's I believe that's what God wants next all right the brother Brown says this the only way that you can respect God is to respect one another is that right if you want somebody to say something good about you you say something good about somebody else they'll say something good about you and you do unto others as you have done them do unto you nextslide going quickly now alright fearing God is respecting God we talked about this already a little bit but praise ye the Lord these are some verses in the Bible that talk about fear which fears respecting the Lord praise ye the Lord blessed his demand that fear or respect to the Lord that delighteth greatly and His commandments he's a blessed man proverbs 1027 the fear of the Lord prolong its days in other words it makes your life longer but the years of the wicked shall be shortened proverbs 22 for by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor in life nobody uh very few in life that have gotten to positions where they are by disrespecting everybody I kind of highly doubt that they is because respect respect goes a long way and it's very powerful since proverbs 28 14 happy is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief amen next slide fearing God is respecting God Deuteronomy 624 says and the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the Lord our God for our for our good always that's why God has our good in mind no not our not not not because you fear God you're gonna you're gonna have you're gonna be something Bad's gonna happen to you know the Bible says that something good always happens see whenever you respect God whenever you fear the Lord that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day so I'm 34 9 Oh fear the Lord ye his Saints for there is no one to them that fear him next slide brother Branham says that we're almost done and today that's the thing today when we see people and people are so subject in this day to jump in a little flower everything till it makes you kind of wonder sometimes don't never think above one man above another this goes for parents this goes for husbands and wives this goes for the church body don't never think about one man or another no sir no matter who he is if he's just a little fellow out here giving tracts out on the street and if he's a Billy Graham no matter who he is if he's God's servant respect them all the same everyone don't have one above another and favorites there's no favorites in God weird all his servants maybe you have preferences maybe you have you you enjoy maybe this style more than this style but no I'm not gonna listen to him because I like this person more this preacher know if it's the Word of God it's the Word of God we don't have that brother Branham says don't do that and don't respect one person above another let everybody be on the level I believe that's sensible next slide now one of the best sides of submission is when Isaac submitted to Abraham I mean here's a young man I'm almost done Saints but here's a little ya a young man in his teenage years I don't know exactly how old he was but he seemed like he was past 13 years old and did not it's that carries him up to the top of mountain tells him to carry the wood he's just obeying doing what he was supposed to do and then all of a sudden his father says all right son I'm mad you know and starting starts tying him down starts doing this and you know what he just sit there and he probably hasn't looked dad what's happening what's going on what what did I do it's the Sun and maybe Abraham couldn't just say anything to him about it he was he was just expecting for God to do something because he knew that God had promised him that son and all Isaac did was just submit to his dad's prayer now young people your dads are not that bad now it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't that Abraham was told to do that but your dad's never done that neither has your mom for you for her to deserve the disrespect that you give her from day to day or him from day to day you're always fed you're always nourished you're always have things that you that you need and respect them respect is what needs to go there what a wonderful story and you know what because God because Abraham respected God's command to him and Isaac respected who was a type of Christ Isaac respected his father God came on the scene you see what respect does whatwhat submission does it never can never go wrong next next one and this one I'm gonna in one of my favorite stories is the respect that David had towards Saul even though Saul was trying to kill him even though Saul was following him twice in the word and you can read this in first samuel over this first samuel chapter 24 and then again in chapter 26 i believe they saw was looking for for david up in the mountains and in a cave and david god david could have killed saw in both instances and we don't have time to read it but you go home and read it and you see the attitude that David took towards saw knowing that that was his enemy and even even David's era of friends was telling him God has delivered he saw to you this is your chance take it take it God has done it and David would not put his hand on saw his enemy why because Indian David says there's many times he says I I will not hurt the Lord's anointed he was respectful to the anointing he was respectful to the anointing amen twice the first time he was he cut off Saul's saws ham of His garment and showed it to him I said look God could have delivered delivered me to you but I refused it I refused to kill you then two chapters later saw again in his crazy ways goes and tries to find David again and and David he and one of his friends pulls out Saul's javelin out or his spear takes it away from him and then later when he reveals to him that he's there it shows him hey look I look I was right there right next to you close to you took your halt your javelin and could have could have killed you and did it what are you for chasing me and in one of those instances he bowed he actually bows down before it's all respect and Saul could have probably killed him right there but he wouldn't do it because of that respect that was there that David was coming out of David for a man that was trying to kill him amen so I think that's it so Saints I hope that you see respect and submission in a different light oh this is help you can never show too much respect to anybody and it's and nothing and something good would not come out of it but every time that you're disrespectful especially to eat one another I challenge you Saints let's let's if you're doing it if you're in the habit of doing it it's time to cut it down Thanks we're not gonna have next thing is a resurrection I want to see a resurrection this respect whatever is hindering your life needs to start getting away from you this you needs to start cutting those things out of your life because we know that the word is true we know that that's the next thing that's taking place and if it wasn't important to talk about this respect and in respect they wouldn't be in the word this is important just as much as any other doctrine is just as much as any other things that you can know all mysteries Paul said and not have love not have respect for one another and used to sound and brass and a tinkling cymbal let's start practicing this are challenging the rest of the year challenging and make it a habit you've made it a habit of disrespect now let's make it a habit of respect and then you pray for me because that's my desire and I'll pray for you God bless you all let's stand to our feet and what do we have brother boy amen I surrender all let's just sing that unto Him this you know Saints there's many other examples even brother Branham gave in his life he had many examples of respect disrespect and things like that many things that we could talk about just so many things but let's just surrender all to him and and then maybe maybe in your own prayer time at home and say Lord let me surrender to you because the more I surrender to you the more it will be easier for me to to show respect to others to show you respect I will be able to show respect unto others and in turn you will receive respect amen all to Jesus I surrender all to him I freely [Music] and Trust and his presence day I surrender I surrender Oh to thee my blessed same sir and [Music] all to Jesus I surrender [Music] forsake and take me Jesus take me I surrender I surrender all

God amen well I don't know if there's anything brother Wade anything okay all right so remember Sunday obviously so let's make sure a man we respect God by coming to the house of God hey man praise the Lord so let's uh any all hearts and minds are clear so let's just uh let's pray for one another as you maybe dismiss let's just have a word of Prayer before we dismiss our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once more for your word we appreciate you Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity to open back the pages of the of it Lord and to see these troops father God and Lord we ask
