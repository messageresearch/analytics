========================================

on M all right here we go Genesis 4 um I'm trying to get Kane out of uh even into nod um so last time I think we stopped around verse 15 and that's the verse we're going to talk about today and the Lord said unto him who therefore whosoever slay Cain Vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord said a March upon Cain L any finding him kill so just to recap where we where we come from um you know the Jews have separated Genesis into 12 different divisions and Genesis uh this second chapter is the end of the uh I'm sorry the fourth chapter is the end of the second division and um the way you can think of it is there's 12 different genealogies in Genesis the the genealogy of the creation of the Earth the genealogy of the his history of the heavens and earth the genealogy of Adam the genealogy of Noah the sons of Noah Shem Tara ishma Isaac Esau the sons of Esau and Jacob 12 different genealogies and a genealogy tells you where you came from where you're going that uh the uh development of um how things develop so that's what um that's that's part of what Genesis is all about telling us where we came from and that's one of the reasons why Satan hates this book is because it's the uh the history the genealogy of of the believer and of Satan and the serpent seed and um you you know you think about where uh how Abel and Cain par parallel the believer today where Abel had a revelation of where he came came from where he's going and how to have fellowship with God and that's the type of the Holy Ghost filed believer today that we have understanding God has revealed these things to us especially in this age in all the previous Church ages we uh you know they a lot of the things the Loose Ends hadn't been tied together but especially in this age we have a revelation of how to come back to fellowship with God that Cain rejected what Abel's message was and went off he was he received a mark and went off into the Land of Nod took a wife from uh the world and uh is a type of the unbeliever today that that Mark that he received um you know there's a lot of speculation in the denomination about what what the mark of the beast was was it like some kind of tattoo or something but brother bandam said that Mark was unbelief when he took that Mark the Beast he uh you know how what does it look like today when you take the mark the Mark is serpent seed is adultery taking or adding to God's word if you add to or take away from God's word you reject God's um you reject God's plan for your day and that marks you uh there's one quote I don't have it but um where brother R said that when you take the Mark today you go back into your denominational system what really denomination is if you go to the bank and you say you can when you go to the bank and withdraw funds you either you have two choices you can withdraw everything or you can withdraw a denomination and the denomination is only part of the whole and that's what denomination is it's not everything it's just a part man's man's ideas and man's systems and the reason Cain couldn't wouldn't accept Abel's message is because the word was not his absolute if the word is your absolute then if you need healing if you need the Holy Ghost you can look at God's promises and you can Bank everything on that and Cain couldn't he he looked at God's word and said it I'd rather take my own ideas I'd rather take um or in this day I'd rather take what my church system my church organization the denomination says is right instead of looking at God's word you know a lot of times you can open the scriptures and show people you know I heard brother Dell many times say it before he's opened the word word the scriptures and pointed to a scripture and said this is why I believe what I believe and this is why it's true and somebody can look at that say well I'm going to take what my denomination says instead because the word is not their absolute my wife was we had a conversation about this yesterday why can you know people from our hom School group come to our house and look we have the pillar fire over our manle the picture of brother randam they look at that and say who is that we'll tell them it's brother Brown Willam brand them and we tell them a little bit about them and they say a lot of times the response well so far every time the response has been oh yeah I know about him and um it just cuts off the whole conversation because they have no desire to know anything about uh the word is not their absolute they have no desire to come and that's that's what Cain's problem was and that's why he was marked and went away and so let's uh that uh let me talk about one more thing if you if you think about um how the first family started and how what a miserable situation that was where Adam his wife left him became impregnated by the Beast she he took her back and now he's got these two sons they're they're born and he's like I don't know which one is mine something's wrong and they they grow older and uh it's it's a it's a family situation that many times in today's life you might be tempted to criticize other people that are in a Sim similar situation but the uh the whole history of the world started with this kind of broken family where um Adam's in this horrible situation that was caused by sin but now I think that's what really if you if you kind of look at Cain's situation where uh Abel had a conversation with him and Cain realized where he came from Abel had that revelation of where he came from and then he told his Revelation to Cain Cain's like okay now and in jealousy he slew Abel and then he he was afraid that vengeance will be taken on him now think about who is left on the earth Cain's afraid that vengeance is going to be taken on him there's only Adam and Eve and Cain and perhaps some of the daughters that were born because the do daughters not listenting the genealogy there's not any other Sons to take to take Vengeance at that time right so I I I I believe that uh What uh what Cain was saying is he's telling God I I am afraid that your seed the sons of God will take Vengeance on me um so let's let's uh look at this a little bit more uh in Romans 12 19 now I believe um that Hebrews 138 is really the key to understanding all scripture because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he was the same back there in the Old Testament and you can see it running all the way down it was Christ and Moses that told God a quote better way of doing things it was Christ and able that believe God's word it's Christ all the way down and if you can see any any uh if you want to understand scripture it has to run in continuity through the entire Bible from the Old Testament to the new so Romans 12:19 says dearly beloved avenge not yourself but rather give Place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay sayith the Lord so this uh promise that Cain Vengeance should not be taken on Cain we'll read a little bit later how lamech one of the I think he was the grandson of of Cain he took this a little bit differently and said uh instead of God taking Vengeance leaving the Vengeance to God he decided he was going to take vengance by himself he was wrong and he killed a man Proverbs 20 verse 22 chapter 20 verse 22 20 22 2022 say not thou I will recompense evil but wait on the Lord he shall save you recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of men so I'm going to compare uh I'm going to keep going down this line of thought but in a little bit I'm going to compare Cain was protected from Vengeance but then in the Old Testament you have the Israelites uh as violence increases in the earth they uh you know that God gives the Commandments of the Lord when you murder someone kill them and we're going to take a look at why that's different it seems like it's different um just just uh they know what's coming up Ecclesiastes 8 verse 11-13 I've heard people say before um Ecclesiastes 8 11 13 I've heard people say why why do the uh actually heard people say this why do the evil people that I know that have criticized the message why do they live such long Lives why does it seem like no harm comes upon them and uh that's kind of why but my my personally I don't really like that song farther along too much because of the in in the song There Is U you know it talks about Farther Along we're going to know why these people aren't punished right now and uh that's that's my personal sentiment um I'll give youall that be all free in charge uh so let's read read this in chapter 8 verse 11-13 because sentence against an evil is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil though a sinner do evil 100 times and his days be prolonged yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God which fear before him but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he fearth not before God so in other words you just worry about yourself don't worry about and uh and uh you know the word is our absolute so we can take confidence that all things will work together for them that love the Lord not all things will work together for everybody you know people quote that a lot of times they misquote it but it's for them that love the Lord that all things work together let me get my quotes together Timbo HD my quotes for me earlier and just SP scared me half to death off my CL not funny no that wasn't um Matthew 511 now I'm just trying to run through the whole scripture to show how in continuity the the spirit of Christ is not to if someone reviles you or uh uh turns down the message cuz really Abel was a type of Christ and Cain was a type of of Judas the Antichrist and just because somebody turns down your message or you know witness to them and they they stab you in the back doesn't mean you destroy them and return uh Matthew 511 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you fals for my sake that's the spirit of Christ so um it's now let's kind of look at there's there's two parts to the Sevenfold punishment of Cain first part is to let him alone we're going to look at down through history some stories uh how uh you know in Hosea it says dan and Ephraim were to be let alone um and polycart and the first church at Rome how that story the scripture in Hosea kind of Builds on that and um so let's look is before we look at that let's look at the Sevenfold reproof there's a reason why it was a Sevenfold reproof um originally you know God showed Cain Grace and uh even in a marriage and divorce you you look back to the in how it was in the beginning to see that in the beginning you know we just had it was just one woman one man at the beginning God showed gr can Grace there wasn't any uh he he he killed Abel so let's kill him um and the Sevenfold punishment for anyone that observing Cain repeats his offense so the Sevenfold punishment is to Cain to say you don't need to worry about the sons of God killing you that's it's it's a testimony that uh uh I believe God was testifying to Cain that Cain gets let's say level one of the punishment but Cain says well I'm afraid that Adam and his uh offspring are going to come and kill me God says let it let there be a Sevenfold punishment if vengeance is taken against you now of course this doesn't doesn't just apply to Adam and his offspring it applies to anyone that that takes Vengeance on Kan I'm just trying to to make a point that uh the the spirit of Christ run through the whole Bible and the spirit of Christ was in Abel and and all the that that early family um so let's look at Leviticus 2613 you say you might say there's nowhere else in in scripture where a Sevenfold Repro was given to the children of God in Leviticus chap 26 God is telling Israel how he's going to bless them if they if they obey his Commandments and um and then he tells them what he's going to do if they don't obey his commandments so let's start at verse 13 and this is going to be a lot of reading I think we're going to read to about verse 20 28 I am the Lord your God which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt that you should not be their bond men and I have broken the bands of your yoke and made you go upright but if you will not hearken unto me and will not do all these Commandments and if you shall despise my statutes or if your soul upore my judgments so that you will not do all my Commandments but that you break my Covenant I also will do this unto you I will even appoint over you Terror consumption and the burning Aid thou that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it and I will set my face against you you you and you shall be slain before your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you and if you will not yet for all this hearken unto me then I will punish you seven times more for your sins and I will break the pride of your power and I will make your Heaven as iron and your Earth as brass and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase does that sound familiar neither shall the tree of the land yield their fruits that sounds like Cain's curse the the ground will not yield forth and if you walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins I will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your highways shall be desolate and if you will not be reformed by Me by these things but will will walk contrary unto me then will I also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven times for your sins and I will bring a sword upon you that shall Avenge the quarrel of my Covenant and when you are gathered together within your cities I will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy and when I have broken the staff of your bread 10 women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread Again by weight and you shall eat can not be satisfied and if you will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me then I will walk contrary unto you also in Fury and I even I will chastise you seven times for your sins so you can see that Cain was a living walking testimony that God's word was true and anybody that would look upon him he's a a testimony to not do like Cain did and if you go his way and do to him like he did to God's people then seven a Sevenfold curse will be placed upon you just like here in Leviticus where God says if you will not hearken to my words I'll will give you I'll curse you seven times over the curse was also a this this warning was also a uh I was reading what John Calvin had to say about this and he he had a good point that it it was a uh a way to speedily bring a halt to any downward hurdle of violence where which is what happened with lch side of the family uh where it uh until the flood violence slowly increased because they misinterpreted this as um if somebody does me wrong I'll do them wrong and some violence began to increase let's look at uh first John 5:116 John first John getting into the the believer's relationship with those that reject the message this is now Cain had he had send to sin unto death which is he had totally rejected the message going back into his denominational system um which is not the full word taking or adding to and um Matthew 1 John 5:116 says if any man see his brother s man sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not into death there is a sin unto death I did not say that he should pray for it because they've turned down the gospel what good would it do to pray for uh Pain's been marked and he's um going away Matthew 1514 actually I started at 13 um no let start at 10 and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this say but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up let them alone they be blind leaders of the B blind and if they if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch so if they want go away let him alone um we're just about out of time but uh let me see if I can squeeze in this little story of Dan and Ephraim and it might be kind of hard Rel quick now you brother claw's message Wednesday night really bless me cuz he's talking about about the Levites and um the just to go into the story of Ephraim we need to back up a little bit and talk about uh how the Levites were separated from the Lord um you know a levite and a priest are not the same thing because you're if you're a priest you're a levite but if you're a levite you're not necessarily a priest because to be a priest you have to be a son of Aaron the Levites were separated from God and here's the reason why and y'all don't have to to this I'll just read it in Exodus 32: 26-29 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the Lord's Side let him come unto me and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him and he said unto them thus sayith the Lord the god of Israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man His companion and every man his neighbor and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses and there fellow of the people that day about 3,000 men because that all of the Levites it doesn't say just a little bit of them all of them stood for God all of the Levites were chosen to serve God in the temp in the in the temple of the Tabernacle and to carry the the furniture and to take care of stand in the door as watch um and to take care of things um in numbers 18:6 and I behold I have taken your brother and the Levites from among the children of Israel to you they are given as a gift for the Lord to do the service of the Tabernacle of congregation numbers 10 11 28 list the 12 tribes as Ruben Simeon isachar Judah zeul Benjamin Dan naal Gad Asher Ephraim and Manasseh Le Levi since Levi ministered to the 12 tribes they were separate because they were uh they camped in the Middle With The Ark and the Tabernacle and all the other 12 tribes camped around him um which is a type of the four gospels guarding Jesus the ministry of the that he the book of Acts which is Christ and the church and um they always camp three side three to a tribes to a side and you'll notice that in Ephraim in Revelation is removed from this list of Tri uh list of tribes and numbers and the reason of what happened to Dan and Ephraim is in Deuteronomy 29:16 to2 where uh God said um trying to hurry Dan uh Deuteronomy 29:16 Dan went worship idols and the Lord said the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under Heaven uh the curse of idolatry was to have your name blotted out and in First Kings 12230 uh Dan they set up uh a uh they they began to commit idolatry in in uh Dan and they went to um they made two calves of gold and set that up in Dan so they were blotted out and then uh in Hosea 4:17 it says Ephraim is joined to Idols let him alone so they we have that same theme of there once they join themselves to idolatry which is spiritual adultery and that's the serpent seed spiritual adultery uh just let them alone because at that point there's there're they're going to fall in the ditch as Matthew said uh and in Matthew 24:35 it says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away and God remembered his word in Deuteronomy by removing Dan and epim from the final list of tribes sealed in the 144,000 um so next time we'll look at how that that promise in Hosea leave him alone at carries forward to the story of polycarp in the First Church of Rome so I'll get out of here oh
