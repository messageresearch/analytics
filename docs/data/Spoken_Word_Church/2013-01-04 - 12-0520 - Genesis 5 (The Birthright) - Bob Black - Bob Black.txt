========================================

if y'all remember where we were last time we were looking at uh Matthew 1 the book of the generations of Adam I mean of Jesus Christ but um before we turn there I'm going to start at Galatians chapter 3 because I got to um studying on the the generations and really uh I kind of started studying on the birth right so I want to um start at Abraham and kind of go down the birthright blessings the Covenant and all the way through the um if you look at the birthright it's uh kind of difficult to understand sometimes because the birth right has a there's a natural birth right and a spiritual birth right there's natural the promise of natural Kings and the promise of Kings and Priests we become Kings and Priests in the kingdom kingdom so uh we'll compare all that and uh's let's just start at Galatians chter 3 verse 5 and um where we're going is um how that The Blessing of Abraham came on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ so let's start at Galatians 35 he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith remember brother brand talked about two covenants the first Covenant with with Adam was you got to obey me and then he established a second Covenant which was unconditional that if you're part of the circumcision if you're part of the new birth then he's going to bring you to where you're supposed to go even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are a faith faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would just justify the Heathen through faith that's us preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in the shall All Nations be blessed and we'll see in a second this is part of the Covenant that the Covenant with Abraham was that there would be Kings come out of him there would be many nations so this is part of the Covenant in these shall All Nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but then no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of Faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that HTH on on the tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disan knowth or added thereto now to Abraham and his Seed where the promis is made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to th to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after cannot disan that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed of Christ should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a median so let's um at as we go through the the birthright promises remember there's a promise of many nations a promise of a perpetuated kingdom house throne and a priesthood and um just to kind of give an idea of where we're going brother ROM talked about what the birthright is to us and hearing recognizing acting on the work of God on the word of God 1960 now anyone knows that the Seal of God is the birth right the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it's your right from God it's your right to the firstborn and we're part of the firstborn the firstborn of all creation which is Christ hearing receiving and acting 1960 so it didn't mean anything to Esau he despised it and the carnal believer today still despises that Birthright and the birthright is the holy spirit we know we are we know that and the carnal believer despises that oh he said them days are passed there's no such a thing as receiving the Holy Ghost anymore that was way back that was in back in the apostles time so let's start at Abraham in Genesis chapter 12 and keep in mind the context of this is the generations of Jesus Christ and it's in in Matthew 1 and it starts in Abraham so that's that's why we're starting in Abraham to go through Matthew's genealogy and the first thing that God did God told Abraham to do was separate himself now the Lord said unto Abram in verse one get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing he said he'll make him a great nation but later on we'll read that he he's going to he's promising him to to to give him many nations to be the father of many nations and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curse thee and in thee shall all families of the of the earth be blessed so starting out Abraham's got to separate himself from the things of the world from uh he got to get it get out of the country get away from uh all the old things that he knew all of the kind of the denominational Concepts and things that we're we're trying to get out of us through the walk up the statue of a perfect man and then God can bless him let's turn to chapter 13 let's look at verse 14 and I gave brother Joe my notes to put on the web but um I I was scrambling this morning to I I realized I left out Genesis 13 in the notes so um I I'll try to get him an update um but this is where the uh God first establishes his Covenant with Abraham then he comes along later and confirms it verse 14 and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him after that lot was separated from him so he had to be separated first lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward everything that he could see for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever now remember as we go through this there's a a a natural and a spiritual CU God gives you the uh I was reading the if you remember the story of nabas Vineyard when Ahab tried to take NAB Vineyard away he said for God forbid that I would sell my inheritance cuz this is it's my god-given right God forbid that you would uh you know it's it's something that nobody can take away from you let's see for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever so the land the natural land is Promised but also think of it spiritually that God has promised to you all of these blessings and God forbid that any body would try to take it from you or that you would give it away and I I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall th seed also be numbered now remember there's natural and spiritual dust of the Earth this is natural and later on we're going to see how God said look up to the stars of Heaven the spiritual seed that's us arise walk through the land and the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee go ahead and walk through it and see what God God's promise to you then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of memory which is in Hein and built there an altar unto the Lord now Abraham realized he's got he's got all these blessings you realize that he needed an air he needed because if you what's going to happen if Abraham dies the the promises are just um they stop at Abraham and uh I'll just read Romans 816117 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so if you are a child you get everything that's promised to your father and because we're children of God we get all of the promises that he he promised to us so this is this is where we're going with uh let's go to Genesis chapter 15 where Abraham was promised a son after these things me the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and I exceeding great reward his name is still AEL and Abram said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eleazar of Damascus he's looking for an air to pass down the promises of God and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine a and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air and he brought him forth a broad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy see be now this is his spiritual Heritage he promised him his natural heritage that that the kingdoms of Israel and Judah and all of his his 12 sons now he's promised them a spiritual Heritage that's not flesh and blood remember we talked about Jacob's Ladder if you're part of that genealogy then you're part of the stars of Heaven that were promised to Abraham and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and it's interesting that even in the Old Testament you're saved by faith if you if any anybody could come and offer a ox or a a sacrifice but unless you believed it had no meaning you had to first come like Abel remember we talked about Abel first belied what God promised him and then he came and B his sacrifice so Abraham believed in the Lord and it was counted to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of er the Cales to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me an hepher of 3 years old and a sheot of 3 years old and a ram of 3 years old and a turtle dove and a young pigon and he took un him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not and when the fouls came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep Sleek fell upon Abram a Lo of horror of great Darkness fell upon him now later on we're going to see how Jacob wanted to he you know he when we get to Jacob we'll look at how he took the birthright from Esau but that wasn't enough and he had to get the blessing from his from his dad that wasn't enough he had then he went and wrestled with the angel and confirmed the promise so this is what AB Abraham's like I know you promised to me but confirm it I want to I want something real I want a real experience it does so this is so let's uh take a look at um what the sacrifice means he sacrificed a hepher and a sheo and a ram and a hepher is a is a young female cow that's never born a calf fresh in its life it's it's got its youthful beiger when I think about how this applies to Christ how God how Christ ministered on the earth for three for three years she go to three years represents a sin offering and the ram is uh usually represented in scripture as consecrates consecrated um and he God split the animals into two dispensations but he didn't split the turtle do because all down through scripture the turtle does represent healing and healing remain to unchange through the Old Testament and the New Testament through both covenants if there was if the old Covenant had toine healing now this is a good thought how much greater should the New Testament the new New Covenant of divine heing in Jehovah Gyra uh 1964 brother R said what God was showing there he was doing that God himself was coming down to be made flesh and he was going to be in the Covenant and God took Christ the spirit god Jehovah took Christ at on the cross and he tore him into two he ripped out his soul and set it on high and took the body and put it in the grave and lifted up the body in the morning of the the resurrection and sent back the spirit that was upon him to be on the church that the same confirmation in this last days Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever with that same Covenant would have to be in the people now remember brother Brandon preached in matching pieces and a lot of different sermons about how the and they would make a covenant by riding on parchment the the terms of the Covenant and then tear it at a half and one would take one half and the other would take the other and you had to bring it they the matching the pieces had to match and remember Jacob's Ladder uh Christ sacrific at the bottom anchored at the bottom in the temple of God at the top and if you part of Christ at the bottom you match with with uh with with the soul of God you got what's inside of you has to match and that's what these two tearing apart these two covenants represent that you got it's matching pieces he ripped out his soul and set it on high and took the body and put it in the grave and lifted up the body in the morning morning of the resurrection and sent back the spirit that was upon him to be on the church let's see where and the f verse 11 and when the fouls came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away now think about this Abraham's offered his sacrifice he's done what God has required him to do now just like Abel waited for the for God to come down and consume the sacrifice to accept it Abraham's waiting on on God to do something and he doesn't know exactly what's going to happen but he's going to keep everything in line he's going to live a Sanctified life to make sure that everything's lined up just right so that when when it comes time for the Covenant to be made manifest then it'll there won't be anything in the way so he drove away all the fouls anything that would deprive anything that would take little bits away from the sacrifice he kept it clear clean up all the little fouls and things that would come and spoil the whole situation and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and low and horror of great Darkness fell upon him remember we were talking about Jacob laying down on that stone and God put him to sleep because God's got to get you out of the way before he can do something and this deep sleep represents the the death that faces every person person and he put Abraham into a deep sleep to show that Abraham hadn't do didn't have anything to do with God's Vindication he didn't have anything to do with it nothing nothing good in himself nothing good in any of us that we could take glory in is completely a work of the Holy Spirit and then the smoking furnace uh see got the smoking furnace types hell that every sinner deserves to go to hell it Al also represents in in Jeremiah 11 uh God Jeremiah prophesied say thou unto them thus sayith the Lord God of Israel cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this Covenant which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt from the iron furnace saying obey my voice voice and do them according to all which I command you so Israel went through a furnace before they were brought forth into God's promises brought forth into the land of promise but every believer is supposed to every uh every sinner deserves to go to hell and facing that Smoky furnace but then came the burning lamb which represents God confir his Covenant and Jehovah G 1956 he says so death comes first then hell was the next the smoking furnace then he saw a burning lamp of light now watch and this lamp went between each one of those pieces making a covenant that God someday through the promised seed would raise up the Lord Jesus to confirm the Covenant with all the peoples of the earth which Abraham was a father of Nations remember the Covenant of many nations many nations naturally and many nations spiritually no notice he changed his name after that from Abram to Abraham now notice the Covenant uh and then he talks about the the the two halves so let's finish reading and he said let's see let's start at verse 12 and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and low and horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger and a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shal be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the inequity of the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces and the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates the kenites and the kenites and the cites and the Hittites and the perizzites and the Rams and the amorites and the Canaanites and the gites and the jeites so God confirmed his Covenant with Abraham supernaturally now we're going to go to Genesis 17 I think U hold on just a second my printer uh printed out my pages in work so then we're going to look at ishmail that's that's verse 16 is ishmail was born and um let's go ahead and look at verse chapter 17 tell that kind of talks about uh Ishmael there's a reason Ishmael couldn't be chosen so in Genesis chap 18 it's chapter 17 Abraham's 90 years old he's he's childless U and and I know we've all heard this before but remember the the parable ma in Matthew that Jesus told of the good Steward that had in his treasure box he had new things and old things so even though you might have heard before still part of the treasure box um and when Abraham was 90 Abram was 90 years old in nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on this is again the Covenant of many nations he's going to multiply uh and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram by thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make Nations out of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and I seed after thee and their generations for an everlasting coverer to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land for Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their Generations this is my Covenant which he shall be between me and you and thy seed after thee every Manchild among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin it shall be a token of the Covenant between me and you and he that is 8 days old shall be circumcised among you every Manchild in your Generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed he that is born in thine house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant and the uncircumcised Manchild whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that Soul shall be cut off from his people he have broken my Covenant the uncondition Covenant requires circumcision you can't just take any any person off the street and say they're uh they're going to be part of this unconditional Covenant you must be filled with the Holy Ghost that the the new this New Covenant requires circumcision in the heart so you got to be part of the part of you got to be circumcised in the heart be part of the unconditional Covenant so Abraham's 90 he doesn't have any children and God promises he changes his name from Abram to Abraham he promises not just one nation but many nations so if God fulfills This Promise then you can take by the New Birth the spiritual the spiritual promise then people from nations from all around the world can stand beside the natural children of Israel and say I have Abraham to my father also because you're it's a promise to many nations Kings shall come out of the he's going to establish a kingdom A N A kingdom of Kings and Priests that we can go behind the veil and a natural that there's going to be if we're going to look down through Matthew the genealogy all the kings an unbroken lineage not like the if you look at the uh the genealogy of Judah the uh the generations of all the kings is completely unbroken father son father son but if you look at the genealogy of Israel and there's eight different uh uh groups of families so it's it's broken in lots of different places but not so with the genealogy of Judah because God promised a n natural that Kings would comes out come out of thee to be a god unto thee and thy seed after thee the promise of the land of Canaan to Abraham and his seed an everlasting Bond of Poss not just ownership but you you possess as yours uh we talk about NAB Vineyard God forbid that somebody would take that from him and brother Ram said about the unconditional Covenant in brass serpent 1953 and he tore the life out of Christ he took the body and set it on his right hand and sent the Holy Ghost back to the church which is the unconditional Covenant given to man tonight brother the life of Jesus Christ must be in every individual that's God's covenant and as sure as you're born of the spirit of God the Holy Ghost in you God is under one statement that he to raise you up in the last days he'll heal the sickness and uh I I've been having a wonderful time looking at all the promises and the birth right because um there's some there's some good stuff here um so then almost out of time you have eight minutes Well I this is this is probably a good stoping place so I'll go ahead stop here straighten out my nose for next time you
