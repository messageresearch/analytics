revelation 1 and revelation 8 we will begin reading in verse 2 of revelation 8 just remember each one that they're sick there's plenty of them that's this out and i hope they're watching tonight and

and and say thank you lord and thank you for the the way of internets and things to where we can be in the service and you know and kind of look in on the things and and not have to miss church because it's a hard thing but just remember each one all of these that are coughing all the sicknesses and all the things that have taken place satan's just doing everything he can to hinder in every way that he can but we know who the victory is you know who the healer is so we just thank you revelations 1 and revelations 8 now remember i know you've announced this but wade will be preaching at brother pinkston uh this coming weekend and i think on wednesday also and then the bible study will be on february the 2nd that'll be the first saturday in february so we'll announce that ahead and also too we've got to have the voting for the officers coming up this sunday so if it's anybody that doesn't want to serve in your office or anything you know any that's the part that you have let us know by then because that way we don't have to vote and everything we can just do it on over all one vote and everything will be taken care of but if not then we have to replace people because we got to have the people to do the jobs and and the working and everything else and you know to take care of it okay revelation 1 revelation 8. heavenly father we thank you lord for your grace and your love thank you for the day and the hour that we're living that we could lord take a little time during the week and just set it aside and get together and that we could talk a little bit about you we know that the hour is approaching of all things when these things will be removed from us or the opportunity of maybe even having a service and things because we know satan's doing everything he can to stop in every way you know and getting all the controls that he can get and it'll be there but yet the little bride will be protected because all even though egypt was in darkness goshen had light so we thank you for the promises that you've given them to us and all the things and we pray now that you bless each one remember all the ones that are sick lord just reach down and touch each one you just deliver from these old cold flus whatever they're called we know it's just satan in every way he can trying to hinder us we know who the healer is and we love you and we thank you we ask you to guide us all in what to say on these things and just have your way now in jesus name amen revelations one that we've been reading then we'll go to revelation 8 it says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now we're going to revelation 8 we're going down to verse two now we've been on verse one you know and talking on the seventh seal you know and uh now we're picking up into the trumpets so we want to try to cover a little bit on that tonight and try to get some of these things out of the way to where we can move through on through the book of revelations verse 2 in revelation 8 verse 2. and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and i was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand and the angel took the sensor and filled it with fire from the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound you may be seated lord it is blessing to the reading of the word now we're not going to spend a lot of time in this we're going to just try to jump through in through some of the things and if there's any questions then you uh write it out and we'll try to back up a little bit and cover it and you know try to to do some things like that and answer questions but you know what i i want you to do is to think with me that we've been through the going through the book of revelations we've come up through and we've covered now over up to cover revelations as far as the 10th chapter and covering the thunders being the voice of god when the seals would break and all then speaking to to us by way of the prophet messenger and in bringing to us the plan of redemption now this that we're doing we're looking at something that is a hard thing to sometimes comprehend by our natural minds but when john is taken up in chapter 4 i don't believe that he went to heaven physically you know i don't believe that he went up there in a corporal body you know i'm just honest i don't believe that if i'm wrong i'm wrong but i'll stand for correction but i i want to to be able to try to hold it together you know in the doings and john would see things that transpires in heaven he may look back toward the earth and do it but yet still he's seeing it in heaven he he's in heaven he's in a heavenly place he's taken up beyond the days of man and gone into the day of the lord all right and to me and to give an example of it would be like brother branham was when he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw people and he saw many different things and was able to come back and tell it but he wasn't there physically you know in a body if we talk about it he was there in his soul which is his theophany and he saw those people in theophany which would be their soul but yet when he saw him he saw people he didn't see spooks floating around he didn't see you know just all kind of little things he saw those people and was able to handle them and and hear them talking and and all kind of things well see then brother branham would when he would tell us about those things he would tell it like that basically like that he was physically there but he wasn't there in a physical form john was taken up to the day of the lord which is beyond the days of man going on into the eternities and to me then you don't have to have something to be there well john went up physically i don't believe he did i've always told you if to me if you saw john he would be laying on patmos maybe with his head you know hands behind his head and you remember he was two years in receiving this revelation so it wouldn't have been a bodily transfer off the earth as much as it is it is it's just a vision revelation brother will call us i've listened to him so many times because i keep it in my truck on the uh he'll say you know people talk about the sermon he said it's a revelation it's a revelation to him just like god revealing one god to us it's like him revealing something you know his name or whatever the prophet when he would see it he would see it by revelation and he would see people going somewhere or traveling or something happening you know and he said it's a vision but he said it's a revelation we'll see then we try to figure all of those things out and we get all this confusion out of it and trying to comprehend but just remember the book of revelations then until you actually come over now i'm going to say it this way so listen until you come over to chapter 22 and the future home comes down up until that time you're dealing with a spiritual revelation being revealed to john in heaven you see yeah we'll be right back into now that's telling what's going to happen that's what i want you to to think with me tonight just one point about the the trumpets is to not try to figure out what happened to cause him to write this you know we'll read some of these about the trumpets and things but you know you look right try to find some great big stone falling out of the sky it's like i've told you it's a great thing to me that in one of these uh i think it's in one of the trumpets that it's talking about a great catastrophe happened and it said seven thousand men died well i mean just a year ago there was 200 000 people died with one earthquake just commies whatever what you call them big old words water running but yet my point is see the bible would emphasize that well if somewhere that would take place like that but look like this over here would be a more major catastrophe but god doesn't choose to write like that if he wrote it down and said you know uh the 25th day of january so and so is going to take place well that wouldn't be no mystery everybody know it but he can write in the bible and tell you what's going to take place and you know what it might take place on that day but that's my point of of doing we went through the plan of redemption we went through the seals and the church ages and come over in the plan of redemption and to seeing that seeing all of the things that transpire you know and coming up to that the great mystery of the seventh seal you know and seeing that it's his coming right but yet we're still here but see there's a mystery goes with that that would show us that we can say he's here in the world look at his worm right right right around i'm not saying he's coming i'm saying he's here come on where's he at behind but you see it was a revelation to him it was like john seeing it on patmos right around sees it by revelation he's taken up into the revelation but not leaving the earth he was standing in the tabernacle preaching them from the pulpit and yet the greatest things that was taking place was being made manifest he said i've never worked in a realm like that before remember he says the opening of the word well to the revealing of god's word instead of us looking to try to figure out what this is and what that is you know when is it going to be that it's going to be this stonefall anything you're searching well ain't never seen no stone fall that big well does it mean it hasn't happened because before we start into these trumpets to talk about them brother adam says six of the trumpets has already sounded all right all right amen and he even says the sixth one just sounded like where was it at i don't know i ain't profit are you even if you got it figured out you wouldn't have nothing but my point is is for us to get into seeing the things that is to be cold to you and i i wrote it down like this because actually you take chapter 7 8 9 11 12 notice there'll be a couple of gaps now 7 8 9 11 12 14 15 16 is really dealing with the calling out of israel of 144 000 people but it's like i've tried to tell you it's like to me like the book of daniel read that sometimes and just read it and just start reading the first and then read the next and read the next but don't try to say well no just read it across and see that it's taking place then a lot of it took place right there maybe some of it would be future but still to look at it and see that we're not looking for some kind of something to fall out of the sky we'll get over a minute where the prophet was talking about these locusts coming out with stingers in their tails and they're the long hired he said it was the men let their hair grow out longer torment to women see we're looking for some great something you know some animal some live looking something some hideous looking things well i i'm not too much on your tvs and things with it but uh you see some of these rock groups and the way they look they look like animals as a matter of fact i ain't never seen an animal that looked that bad that's that was just me not i mean that's more hideous than anything that you could ever see in an animal race but i want you to look at it and and see that that these things are taking place have taken place are taking place and maybe some of it is still to take place but yet not to try to figure out what this is but to just see what is related to you and i about it because now if six of the trumpets has already sounded why would you be trying to figure out well well i just wonder whether it was a great big stone failed or what no i looked through what the prophet had to say and spent quite a time of just trying to pick up the things of the scriptures that he done and and there's very little and he'll answer about these things but then he'll say that it's taking place you say this is the it works out what we're seeing we shouldn't be looking to try to figure out some kind of a an animal something to fit into the situation but to realize these things have already taken place now that's the whole point of the message tonight that's why i say i may not i made this totally jump to to over a good bit starting sunday with something you know maybe i don't know because the main things i said i want you to see is basically everything after which would really be after revelations 4 1 is to israel until you come over until revelations 19. amen well see that that's not even to us that's why when the prophet come along he preached a message he was planning on preaching the trumpets and a different thing but he said i seen i had already preached them supernaturally under the seals he said right well so then we go over there and we study that of the calling out of the 144 000 and i said just about basically every scripture the ones i call a while ago i picked out 10 and left it out because that does do but that still has to deal with the calling out of israel they're called out by this message right all right it's just picking it out to where that we can see the things in the situation like i said daniel then daniel is showing you the same vision higher higher higher higher just like i told you sunday then in chapter six there were the the dealing with the opening of the sixth seal it doesn't talk about 144 000 in no scripture he tells you about the earthquakes and the things that's going to take place but see by way of the prophet he told us chapter 7 is the calling out of israel then you get into the trumpets that we're dealing with here tonight in chapter nine you know eight and nine with a with the trumpets and that's the calling out of israel he said well if that's the calling out of israel then what do we need to know about it we need to know what happened to israel all right and annoying what happens to israel will show us what's happening to you and i am like he says on the feast of the trumpets he said these trumpets is to israel he said really there's only one point we'll get back to that maybe the likes of the message but he said there's really only one point here talking about the bride but yet it's like i've tried to get you to read the seal book and the things of reading the seals and looking in there that that's to israel yet there's a whole lot said for the plan of redemption for you and i israel that's israel that's israel let's go to the next one that's israel that's israel that's israel now there was a lot about those seals and this is the point i want you to get a lot about those seals that brother said they started in genesis started in genesis but yet didn't really hasn't opened yet in reality because there's israel they're after we get out of here but yet we look been at it because of revelation do we go up chapter four well you just think about it until we write back in the 19th chapter that's all that's all that's dealing with you the rest of it is to israel and the things that are taking place but yet it's showing it see looking back to see where these things start they started back in genesis like in the the feast of the trumpets you'll read the message he said these things that you can read here he said that happened back there when they was coming out of egypt all right but that was when listen that was when israel was being called out in the natural it is not in the end time when they're called out in the spiritual right you know i'm looking at the quotes from the prophet that's what he's he's trying to get us to see but i'm just trying to to get us to understand because there's no visitors tonight we can just just kind of cover something and and preach about it a little bit and you know and get a better understanding you see we we read these things and we try to figure it out but why try to figure it out we can get lost trying to figure out what hap when it happened and failing to get to revelation and see the main thing is to see that it's already happened that's right when did the moon turn to blood i don't know we need to know where to move no we don't need to know when the moon turned to blood because you might find out because see we can go through these things you can do your eyes and whatever you might find out the fulfilling of the moon turning the blood or the sun a third of it taken away or some you might find out it was when mount saint helen blowed its top out there you might find out back in history that you've actually had times when almost the entire world was covered with darkness because of the clouds that are from the eruptions in these volcanoes see but my the main thing i want you to just deal with me about it is is these things have already transpired and you and i are the bride we're not like the world wondering what these are right but you see now they get what i'm talking about i hope this don't offend nobody out there but see the religious world wants to know about the beast the the hairy animals the the things that look like a great crank king kong beast or some kind of a things that we'll read here with hell and fire falling and that's all they're interested in no they just that brother so-and-so now if you read the books he's got out manny he tells us all about when these things took place okay but i thought that we were supposed to get the revelation of redemption from reading the bible not the revelation of who russia is coming down after china's coming down after so-and-so is coming down and this is coming down you know because we're supposed to be out of here when they come down so what good does it do we're going up the sky and rapture wouldn't be something whatever i told you but that's going to be when russia was coming out now they're coming down right over there but around him one day he said when you see jerusalem passed about on every side according to scripture and i looked at it and realized our set all of those people russia on one side china on the other side and the united states on the other side sitting right there already come passed about all you got to do is just one little bomb or something go off in the wrong direction and it'll be heyday but i want to find out something that'll get me out of here i want to find out something about redemption and like i said well ago if we can see the redemption of israel then we can see the redemption of the bride and see what's taking place all right see these things then will be after the rapture like run around we'll get on over maybe another message or something revelation 12. he said this takes place between the rapture and armageddon or something like that we'll see then you can go back and see that some of those things is back over here but just remember what was happening as we go through these trumpets the prophet will say that it was the calling out of israel in the natural that you'll see the hail and the stones and the the rivers turn to blood and the different things we read up here but he said this is in the spiritual happening in other words over here in the end time right right all right now and in doing that we can see that whatever transpires to bring them to that redemption is what's bringing us to redemption which is the revelation of jesus christ all right now in doing that see keep that point in mind to where that when we look at it that we won't be trying to figure out we'll just be doing as a prophet would do he said these things to the trumpets he said they have nothing to do with the bride this is the calling out of israel he said now that the trumpets now get to get the background and when we get over to the great trumpet you know and see our day where we're at all right then it'll pick up with you but you see those trumpets back there you know what happened they called israel to the atonement you know they were down in egypt i'm letting you think because maybe it'll click a little then when the hail and the fire and the lightning and the different things that you read up under these trumpets they were down in egypt they had not even offered an atonement yet sure they were offering sacrifices but you know what i mean moses had never come along to give them it's a book of exodus i think is where you start picking up your in leviticus where you start picking up your offerings and your different things we get us a calling out your prophet said these trumpets is a calling of a feast day calling of a war he said bringing forth a certain person is what these trumpets are all right now then if that means that god was calling israel out to bring her to why was he bringing israel out of egypt because he promised yes right but what was the point he was calling them they were hearing the voice of god to lead them through moses to bring them out until word they could make the atonement in leviticus 16. that would be the natural atonement when they came out got everything set up all of that travel from egypt coming down to the time moses set that up was the feast of the trumpets calling them out to a time that they get the atonement all right now that was calling out of a natural people to a natural land natural things and a natural atonement all right we're seeing the end time under these feasts of the trumpets that's why the prophet to me titled it that away feast of the trumpets there's many things involved in it we've been through it here the dead pentecost the different things is involved in it under the feast days we see israel in the last days now listen israel in the last days is not going to go back to offering now we're not talking about natural israel we're talking 144 000 right everybody following me they're not going to go back to offering natural sacrifices so leviticus 23 read the feasts of the tropics leviticus 23 is a mourning for the kill it is not a re-killing leviticus 16 is the killing of the animal the atonement and all that feast was leading all them trumpets with leading them down to bring them down to word that they could finally settle and to hear a great gospel trumpet that would bring them to their natural atonement of the animal but they're not going back to the natural atonement of animals by the prophet the feast of the trumpet he said this is a spiritual sense in the last days he said there caught me and called here to a day of mourning for the keel right see back there they offered the animal you with me they offered the animals they didn't have a morning for a kill they had a rejoicing that the atonement was made okay see it's not showing the end time it's not a natural atonement they're not going back to offering 144 thousands not going back to offering blood bulls and ghosts and natural israel will be trying to do that yeah but that's not who you're dealing about in here or the calling out as i gave you and called out the scripture 7 8 9 10 or no clean over to 19 and really it goes on over but listen my point is this israel in the last days you've heard the story told to the prophet you've read the scriptures that when this 144 000 comes to see their messiah they're going to pull apart right and they're going to mourn as for one the scripture says of losing their only child that back you under when they was coming out of egypt and come to the natural atonement was a killing of the atonement moses tried to smite the rock twice and it wouldn't work so it wouldn't be a killing in the end time it's a morning for the keel in other words they are going to be brought by revelation those two witnesses will bring christ so personal to that hundred and forty four thousand till they'll sit in there and say where did you get your nail press in your hand it's not gonna be standing there with holes in hand it'll be moses and elijah bringing the messiah signed down to israel you see how dangerous would have been if brother rattleman went to eat to israel with that messiah signed because that's what israel is looking for the sign of the prophet the discernments and the things to tell them these things but you see they're not they're not going to be called back to a re-killing the prophet said it's a mourning for the kill in other words they realize what happened they realized what happened back there at calvary they realized that that was the true atonement that they spoke of right and they killed him that atonement that for leviticus 16 was speaking of calvary and christ and the lamb you know all right but then when it comes down into the end it's a morning for the kill turning them to the original atonement which was not leviticus 16. that was a natural atonement they're not being called to a natural atonement of animals and blood goats and things bring feasts to the trumpets or listen to it they're being called to the atonement of jesus christ that 2000 years ago in calvary there was your lamb that paid the price that was why your trumpets was calling them to that but you just thanked them standing there while their god was trumpeting out of heaven their god was hanging on a tree and saying father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they're crying letting blood be on us and our children and that's what's caused the trouble but you see they're coming back in the end time to realize that that they crucified jesus christ and it'll be a morning for the keel not the morning for the leviticus 16 an animal that he was killed back under come on get up into the message with me see then you're looking at it and seeing hey they're being brought back to the original atonement in the morning for the kill all right listen to the prophet tonight do you realize that the holy ghost we'll quote it in a minute and give it to you the holy ghost has been bound for 2 000 years i didn't say that your prophet did all right now the holy ghost has been bound for 2 000 years what about the early church he said well he didn't really mean that i'm sorry he said it twice in the book and according to the book he says these things are thus saith the lord about two times in the message there but see that's what i'm saying there was a man set years ago there was so many slips of the tongue that brought around and made in the feast of the trumpets that you couldn't understand what he was talking about well i agree because he was trying to figure it out intellectually and you can't do it but if you just settle down and think you realize church if israel is to be brought back to the original atonement what about the bride of jesus christ do you know that the holy ghost the prophet will read it to me it said the holy ghost was to be loosed by the end time message so the holy ghost has been bound all the way down through there because it never could work the way he wanted to the great book of acts with the holy ghost in it was not the way god wanted to bring the great things down to the ages of god dealing with his people and speaking to him was not what he wanted see this message is to bring you and i back to the original atonement not a re-killing we're not wanting christ to get up on the cross and die again no but bring us to the original revelation it's like i've always tried my best to tell you you've got to come to the faith of the fathers for before you can talk about the revealing of the seals i've done that for 40 years folks and i still ain't backing up well i don't know how to say the father don't know what seals are so does oral roberts university they got the books and the tapes i'll try to explain that to you week after week after week now right that's why to me that paul said you can have understand all mysteries and how not cherokee right he's talking of two things this charity right down here is faith the born again experience then he goes up to the top amen of charity that's him me all right we see as israel is what i'm saying taking the feast of the trumpet but bringing it back to you and i they are turned to the original atonement of calvary by this message that leads us and goes to them you see you and i have got to return to the original atonement see how could you count the people of this message the way they're talking about jesus doing wrong and wouldn't god to the river jordans and this was wrong the prophet was this how can you count them as to saying that they're in the word but yet they know the quotes by the letter right right they can quote brother random to the letter the words of revelation see without it being revealed it's nothing anyway but letters on the page around said as long as it's laying in this bible what'd he say it can be questioned but he said when it's revealed it comes off of these pages into your heart it can never be questioned again see that's the original atonement you realize how long i've been trying to preach something to you and i 40 something years talking about matching pieces do you realize in revelations 5 he has to climb up on that throne and shut down to fulfill revelations 5. and you know that was when he was crucified and went to the father's throne but is it there in our revelation how could he be messing up doing wrong jesus you know and all that how could he be not god and then you're going to try to put him on the throne in revelations 5. well i don't think that's important i don't believe that's important well then how did he get on the throne of your heart come on amen come on how did he get in your heart by the new birth he climbs up on this throne in our heart it speaks from there see revelations five has got to be fulfilled he climbs up on the throne sits down i thought your prophet said that when jesus raised from the dead and brought up those old testament signs i would listen to some quotes if you were if i were you where he says that he took them up and he took a right to the father's throne and the father says climb up on the throne and sit down and i'll make your enemies your footstool i would check out some things but you see it's got to be a revelation you've got all kind of quotes for everything but what about revelation yeah that's right listen church if the holy ghost has been bound for 2 000 years that's according we'll give it a minute to quote then it means the holy ghost has never worked the way he wanted to you know come down the holy ghost being by him but that wasn't what the prophet said he said it was bound for two thousand years you know there in the book of acts they already had the antichrist work right you already had a phillips and armenians and all kind of doctrines and you better remember that it was an early church that went to nicea come on you better remember that he said well they laugh and come back all right i'll agree with you they did but you know what your prophets you need to keep reading to where he said they had already picked up the thong what the hell did they pick up and i see that jesus wasn't god he was a secondary god now what about the doctrines in the end times that are teaching that that he's a demon god which means he's another kind of a god or a lesser god you see what i'm talking about church do you understand what i'm saying we've got to be returned to the original faith amen that 144 000 don't come over here to offer chips and goats right come on natural israel go back to doing that but not that 144 thousand right they come to the original atonement until they see him and say where did you get the nail prints he said i got him in the house with my friend he said well who are they they're looking at two prophets but do you have any trouble believing that when those two prophets speaks to israel that it's jesus christ in them speaking do you have any trouble with that if you do i'll remind you that there was a time on a tape when a voice come forth and said you're not hearing william branham you're hearing me i'm just using his voice come on you tell me david and them solomon them singing they pierced my hands and my feet actually getting into agony just like that they were hanging on a cross and we call that christ the brethren is not my god those two witnesses won't be their god but those two witnesses will bring god on the scene brought blood on the scene here in the end time amen but you're not hearing the voice of a man come on amen you see church we've got to be returned to the original atonement see in doing that we come back to not just the faith of the fathers we've got to continue on you see why all these 40 years i preached about the seal that the seals were not them to the bride the seals or the israel in the literal happening but the spiritual revelation is to the bride of christ amen the spiritual revelation should bring god just as real to you and i as the physical god could go to israel and i said that the way i wanted it i know he doesn't go there physically but you better think about what i said we should be god should be so real to us until he can become visible among us the prophet said and raise the dead and we'll go into rapture what through us come on hallelujah now see i need to back up about an hour and we're we started off that we read about these trumpets i just can't see where they'll ever happen the prophet said six of them already had but you see we we but brother dale i know you've been preaching for all these years about the bride brother branham said the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily the big man in this message passed on to glory that's his choice i mean his doing but he said you say that the the bride of christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily he said i i don't believe that i didn't say it of course when you believe these two lords you can't see it either that's right when you believe that jesus wasn't god until the river jordan and they finally become god i've got to play paper back there in the office be glad for you to read a newspaper you know that in january the 6th they got up here on lake lanier and they blessed the waters the orthodox catholics bless the waters on lake lanier it's called epiphany or how you pronounce it that's something close to epip h.a.m you got it right you know what that is that's in commemoration when jesus was baptized in river jordan now you read about the newspaper you know what it's called the feast of theophany go home and look up feast of theophany in your computer want me to look up anthony every how you say e-p-i-p-h-a-n-y i'm pretty sure and see what that is they do it every year i thought i need to take this newspaper and i need to print up about 500 of them and mail them out where these brothers could look down and see the glory the earth's word of theophany but you see church i've tried my best to preach to you and i to try to get us to return to the original atonement so we can see jesus christ among us now i'm going to say another word about it and i'll get off and get on the rest of the message but if your eyes are so blinded that you can't see god has been with us then i'm sorry for you physically and spiritually he has raised the dead he has healed the sick he has manifested himself in the spoken word through the little group at lula but the gospel has been preached it still stands all right pure and unadulterated from man's ideas you said no wait just a minute well it's got to be done one day let's get on with it if we don't believe it's here when are we going to believe it yes when are we going to believe that god is among us well maybe one of these days if i could see this out there i kind of i believe that well never will see it but you see israel is not going back to an animal that's right they're going to look back and see calvary listen they're going to see that jesus christ died they'll know he had the nail prints right because they could read the book right is it in this book right that he wound up with now pressing his hands is it in there that's who wasn't uh thomas had to put his hands in the day of friends well they won't see jesus that real but they're not gonna see him two thousand years ago right they're going to see my revelation and they're going to see him standing right there speaking through those two prophets i never have preached really what i saw brother brother said when i saw this i got up and walked out of the room go check what he was talking about he was talking about what god was going to do through two prophets to israel and he said i had to get up and walk out of the room why because he knew what was happening right there he said it's not been a man he said it's been the angels of the lord this message will go to israel by two prophets but they'll have something personal they don't have to go over there as wade was saying the other day about they'll tell it i know they'll tell it because there's no need to worry about it but they won't be going over i said let me give you a quote brother brown said so-and-so they'll have it in their own revelation but then they'll tell them a prophet did come and that's where i got to revelation right was from that prophet's message sure they'll take this message but they don't take brother adam it becomes something personal see then the gospel trumpet will sound to where in the end time they'll see jesus why because it'll be the true atonement right are you and i turn back to the true atonement come on there can't be no trinitarian concept in the truth that's right he said when he was talking to that jew i believe benton harbor where ryan or what received his eyesight and he said in other words how did that man get his eyes out you got to put about four messages together and then you'll get the whole story right around and finally told him what he said through jesus christ god's son that paid the price that jew don't wonder what he said he said you can't cut god up into three or four pieces but i said they know where that trinity come from he said you can't cut god up in three or four pieces and give them to a jew lord said what will the messiah what will be the you know the messiah he's willing to be born he said yes said who will it be did it be god they don't have no second person or third person or river jordan doctrines in theirs or two lords or two souls or any kind of time all they got to do is see the sound of the messiah but you better believe one thing all israel will be able to see the sign of the messiah i mean everybody you know what i'm saying they'll be over there with them you know that everybody don't get converted because the sign of the messiah comes through two prophets am i right but 144 000 that god pricks in their heart that's it there was a man saved on the day of pentecost and never been a man saved yet or one child or whoever that god didn't prick their heart before they received the new birth it's not to receive the new burden then you become pricked in your heart and all you're pricked in your heart read your bible men and brother what must we do to be saved they're going to stand there them two prophets in front of a big old crowd maybe thousands of thousands of them standing in and they'll be preaching and they'll say jesus christ died 99 of my turn around walk off and spit out them but you know there'll be a few that'll just hang around and say tell us a little more because something just spoke in my heart and i want to know amen right but are you following me the calling out of israel in the natural as they come out of egypt there's where you see the hail the stones the different things that you read and really to where you can read it and see that those things did happen but when you come over here in the spiritual quit trying to figure out what happened try to find the goddess of that voice of the trumpet seven angels remember there are seven seals there's seven angels it's in church ages all of those things ties together and all those trumpets and then brother brown will wind it up we'll go back pull his quotes up just a second but he winds up saying that the seventh trumpet to israel is the same as the seventh seal is to the bride think on these things think about it let's just read a little bit i won't ask them dude but get your bible if they can catch up with us we'll read it from that but let's read some of these trumpets and just see but think about it now don't try to figure them out think that they're already happened verse seven okay go ahead and pull up to revelation 8 verse 7 if you get to that time we'll start reading and the first angel sounded this is the troubles and therefore hail and fire mingled with blood they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees were burnt up and all green grass would burn up okay all right to get it up now so we can read it look i'm trying to figure out where that was at let's try to figure out and just remember that as the angels brought the prophet to revelation will not it be the angels it would bring the two prophets to revelation that's why you got seven trumpets of seven see we'll see all right so look at the next one and the second angel sounded and it's where a great mountain burned with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood we can't figure out where that would take place can we in the third part of the creatures of the sea were destroyed on the third angel in other words the third trumpet sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning it where a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters now i hunted up these things to see if i could find anything that would tie it together and help us now when you get to this one which would be coming under your third angel sounded in effect and the name of the star is called wormwood wormwood means bitter waters all right he was the one that destroyed the world with water so we made the waters bitter in egypt right coming out of the natural see you can go back here and try together but that was wormwood see i i just picked up some things but the fourth one sounded what and the third part of the sun was spitting the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars towards the third part of them were darkened and the day shown not for a third part of it and the night likewise you get all tired trying to figure out what that was and i heard a angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice whoa whoa whoa to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels which are yet to sound now woes mean wars world war one world war ii and armageddon will be world war three just because we declared war on afghanistan that didn't make it a world war ii come on that wasn't no world war a world war is when all of the world gained sides and comes at each other and that would be army dead all right flying through the midst of the heavens saying whoa whoa and we'll get to it just a minute on one of them and it says one woe don't happen all right now listen to what i'm saying if one was done happen then one woe was world war one so the prophet's right when he said all the trumpets sound under the sixth seal and he said six of the trumpets had already sounded over here not back there we didn't know neither trying to figure out what it is just pick up what we can through it to see this happen already well i want to know what this is that's what it is even 22. did you understand that one eve wanted to know too it took all her time for four times for 6 000 years she's tried to figure out these things that's what i said organized religion wants to know what all these is about all i want to know is when it takes place and when i hear the prophet saying already taken place i don't have to go back and figure out what took place i just say we're in the end time yeah there came out smoked locust all right locust on the air pull this one up there rose what now the locusts were at heaven there bottomless pit smoke rose out and then he jumped over me one right all right now we're down here back right here is where we get came out and smoked locusts upon the earth and they then was given power scorpions of their you know of the earth how power was given and it was commanded them that they now watch they don't hurt the grass scorpions and everything they hurt the people see they hurt the people that don't have the seal of god in their forehead all right so this is taking place while the seal of god is in our forehead do you understand i'm trying to get you to see that six of the trumpets has already sounded and we ain't in the tribulation period yet and see to find out then that we're here when the seal of god is still in the forehead and you're not to hurt the ones that's got the seal of god you say well that's 140 one thousand yeah that's in the natural but i'm bringing it back over here where we're at that's what i'm trying to show you these are showing where we are now the trumpets is showing where you and i are at we're in the time of the plagues and the vials and the things that are being poured out then when we go out of here it'll really get bad but it's already taken place now but look and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was under the torment of scorpion when he strike at the man come on they'll seek death and can't find it because our design can't die they come out to be like locusts we're likely to horses prepare them to battle on their heads and we're crowned like gold that's not physical things that something that's happening but i don't know where it's happening at but i know it's happening now that's my whole point these things are happening because they're under the trumpets and the trumpets is sounding that unsounding and still sounding look at this one and then hires a higher women and their teachers and teeth of lines brother said it was they tormented him because women cut their hair off and you know in israel that was amazing to me when we went over there i was literally expecting to find women dressed as women i was expecting to find the and it was back to 50s and 60s you know and women had dressed decent and had long hair and had rolled up bonds and put up i never saw a woman over there that had any hair the only sister ones over there that had hair long enough to wash jesus's feet was the sisters that was in the crowd we was in now that's as much what i saw now i didn't go everywhere but i'm just saying i didn't see them living like that i saw them looking like modern-day americans with their hair cropped off in their i didn't see necessarily as much paint on their face but pants on and all kinds of things i was expecting right really when i saw that i thought well i really missed this one because i was expecting it to be annoying these things are taking place or have already taken place right had breastplates of iron and sound of their wings within the sound of chariots many horses running into battle you can't figure that out they had stingers in their tail and their power was to hurt men for months now here's one that we know a little bit about and they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon and in the greek tongue his name is paulie one i guess you said pronounce it look it says and one was priced okay one world fight world war one is gone world war one you start seeing these fellas here coming into being after world war one what was that hitler mussolini and him killing the jews and driving them back to the homeland don't sound much like no joyous trumpets does it but that's what has taken place said that they were loosed on those jews hitler and them killed six million of them just because they were jews this has happened in our day some of us are old enough to remember the end of world war ii maybe and especially in the years after and then what we've seen of the the things where they showed these prison camps where they put them in there and kept them and killed them fed them to i mean done everything destroy them everywhere they shot them brother around said till they run out of bullets just because they were god's people a jew but that was driving them back to the homeland that was their trumpet if you're reading with me you listen we talk about trumpet being the voice of god that's right but what happened under that voice that voice tells you what's going to take place they released those demons and hitler and them drove them so not now let's see if we can pick up a few right now brother joe and we'll try to read just a little bit should be on over it's way over we want to go go to number 13 and we'll start reading a few which is feast of the trumpets while they're getting there our boy and then we can pick up cause it'll be almost continual reading program 161 the feast of the trumpet and notice what happened under that sixth trumpet they were turned loose on the jews the persecution of the jews supernatural devils nearly 2 000 years bound you know kept nearly 2 000 years but then loosed supernatural devils by stalin hitler upon the jews you say well that isn't roman so he must have picked it up right he said it's the same spirit he says they've done the same thing at the old pagan rome done to the christians this is to drive israel back to the homeland folks it's not talking about joyous festivities of a feast of the trumpets that you're having a big time they were killed by the millions to drive them to the homeland the only way god could get them there you talked about those three worlds world war one world war ii and world war three you remember when brother claude i thought it was a marvelous thing and it fit real good brother claude was here preaching about it that time world war one ended without him knowing who stopped the war and it ended with israel being freed right israel being free that's where they were fighting over is israel they didn't know it they don't know who's who ended the war they know don't know nothing about it the brotherhood said i can show you in and 19 it wasn't them getting them wings to do it he said but i can show you something happened and see world war one didn't come to pass to get israel free you know to take over to get that country to set up where they could started being toward the nation world war ii came about because of israel and that's when they went into the homeland and begin to go free hitler and mussolini and all them killing them all over the place all over the world and driving them to the homeland but you know that was god's grace and mercy come on church we look at god as a a god that does no harm no no there's no nothing he had them to kill them jews to get them back into israel sometimes he works on us pretty good to get us back to the truth in the homeland right the message of the hour you just think what that prophet went through to bring this message to you and i thought think of all of the horrible times and all the things that happened and you know what even happened his wife and baby had to be taken from him we look at trumpets and things like beautiful things oh you're a trumpet let's go these are the trumpets that's taking place in our day to drive the jews to the homeland you know that they were jewish backslidden if he's not in israel you know in jerusalem he's backslidden that's what your prophet said you know you and i are backflip we're not in this message now come on if this message is not alive in us come on church this ain't no hot blue good times now i'm going to say something to you so you can go and take what you want to about it and listen that's why it's died down like it has because it's left up to you and i to see whether or not we're going to stand and all these things is sent among us the bible says to what to trust just as israel lost millions but they've gotten them only what about you tonight brother dale if it's not joyous i'd like swat way for a while i felt like for six months that i'm backslid that i'm just totally wondering what's going on but yet the greatest preaching that god ever told mistaken pleasure yeah i stand like a backslid but what's that got to do with anything if you tell me something i'm doing wrong i'll just repent i have no problems with that i repent every day i cry out to god every day i've told you what trip four months ago i was crying for a revival what do you think i've been talking about but yet some of the greatest revelations just come forth it's not a hook law it's not a feast of the trumpets as we think about it as being some kind of a great thing that's what i'm trying to get you to see it's those horrible things you read about i'm like these mountains falling these fires happening all these things was to drive israel back to the homeland it wouldn't back you under that only type that the prophet said coming out of egypt there's only a type of this you know this is the spiritual happening he said and under a spiritual happening hitler and mussolini and him is killing millions of them and the jews are still being tormented by the people of the world they go over there and make one little move and the whole world runs against them now even the united states and yet these bombs falling on israel every day this bombing bombing bombing and they've got them tied with their hands to keep them from being able to retaliate that you see god's work why because there's a few more somewhere that ain't got back to israel yet and it may take a lot of deaths to bring them back to israel but you know what that 144 000 ain't going to be in the united states they're going to be in israel and they're going to be hunted down and persecuted and killed for what they believe under these feasts of the trumpets you understand me we think it's supposed to be joyous in all of this it should be in our hearts i wish i had divorce it's got better the last three services and it's gonna get better but i don't care if it don't get better i'll whisper if i have to that's the other day so brother they wouldn't think anything about retiring i said well i turned my toes up all right i need concerned about it sure would be nice though look at number 14. that was loose them demons was loosed on their hitler now under hitler mussolini on the jew right everybody with me to get back to the homeland now read this one look what it says paragraph 183 what was it it's in the cunningness that he said he come in by flatteries and what have he done he is bringing the protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the scholar just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how loose in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what remember the denominations is the bad guys are we listening you know they are the ecclesiastical spirit that like hitler and mussolini and them drove to israel natural to the homeland we got to be drove to the homeland look what he's saying not upon her denominations upon the bride but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time he's not going through the tribulation right no way she ain't going through the tribulation look the next make sure you just get where he's saying program 189 notice the loosing of this ecclesiastical spirit now 20 years later after that war now remember the war is world war ii world war ii was the driving of israel to the homeland under hitler and mussolini and then right after that war who's it looks on this is 200 thousand demons right it's in the the trumpets there's you really don't down read them two hundred thousand thousand demons was loosed under hitler and eichmann and them to drive them to the homeland and they're loosed on the bride he said 20 years later after that war so if that war ended in 45 somewhere right how about 1965 them ecclesiastical spirits was loosed kind of odd that that was the year the prophet was winding down and bringing his message to the finality loosed on who looked on the bride after that war we see the loose end of the queen's astral spirit what under the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the jews loosed to drive us to the message of the hour so that these other things can take place all right let's read facts go ahead number 16. paragraph 206 207. oh this group down here has got 200 000 bound at the river euphrates that have been bound for 2000 years i also that church has bound the holy ghost for nearly two thousand years now i know it's talking about organized religion i know what he's talking about come on he's talking about organized religion that's what's had it bound but see church until you and i are turned back to the faith of the fathers we're tied up in organized religion whether you like it or not and until the headstone comes which is the seal the opening of the word and counts off us individuals we're still dealing with organized religion that's where our trouble is tonight we've been taught this what brother dale i don't understand you because the feast of the trump is going to be a joyous happy time and you brought it through as eichmann and hitler and the killings down through there and then now you've turned around and said it's loosed on the bride i didn't say it the prophet said it do you believe him amen it's bound for the holy ghost what's happened under the martyrdom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river euphrates but the door creeds and dogmas that the holy spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems but she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the bible said and those two meet one another on the battlefield lucifer and michael again like in the beginning they've been bound for 2 000 years almost almost 2000 years michael is coming back michael is going to be here to battle paragraph 2 43 the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but it's to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy ghost back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised what about it under the seventh trumpet look that next program 155 then we'll quit under the sale of trump it is to israel the same as the seventh seal was to the church all right now let's read that last one and then we'll quit blowing up the neck from brother which is revelation 11. revelation 11 what is the seventh trumpet it's the same as the seventh seal is to the bride what happened under their seventh trumpet sounded and there was great voices and said heaven say the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and his christ and he shall reign forever and ever the kingdoms of this world because when you go to the next when you go to the great trumpet and brother brown said when that great trumpet sound it'll sound and all nations will gather to jerusalem that's when the millennium starts the great trumpet the great trumpet will sound and the millennium will take place one day isaiah will be fulfilled i got the scriptures but look what the seventh seal then must be and look at me this is the only kingdom i'm interested in i'm not interested in russia and china and india and houthi i'm interested in this kingdom here this is the domain that i want him to have possession of is in this tabernacle that you're looking at and the gospel trumpet is to sound in the last days and you and i are to come to the place that we yield these trump these kingdoms no wonder jesus said thy kingdom come thy will be done you weren't talking about physical kingdoms or worlds or land you talk about me and you amen do you understand see then all we're doing is looking at what happens to israel to see what's happening to you in our listening right to see what's happening to you and i what to expect well then what do you expect i expect the holy ghost to be loosed by this end time message but you know what that means somebody's got to preach it right somebody's got to preach it and then somebody's got to live it i know i jumped around a lot but i just didn't want to take something about trumpets and talk about them and talk about it beautiful these companies but them trumpets have been sounding and that's driving israel to the homeland killing them to drive them you mean god would send that that's what he said the only way to get them back to the homeland i preached a message probably 30 something years ago and i never have believed that the bride would go through the tribulation since i heard what the prophet had to say we all believed it when it's an organized religion well we didn't know but when i heard that prophet say it i never believed that the bride would ever go through the tribulation period but i do believe tribulation with patience i don't believe that all of the world or the bride of christ will be hunted down and persecuted i don't believe that but i believe some will the prophet said this song would be physically breath lose all now that's what he had to say you can argue that and fuss all you want to do but it ain't going to be no argument when you're being hunted down you it won't be no good to stan you know brother dale told us this let's just stand right now we'd be running right we'd be running but you see before he can take all of it jesus christ is going to step on the scene the prophet said the bride does better under what persecution we need somebody to argue with us we need somebody to flush with us to find out whether we believe what we believe you know what you don't bother me to get my fuss with somebody because i ain't gonna hurt you i'm just gonna tell you what i believe it may sound like an argument because i'm pretty good at words but i also know one thing an argument ain't never won nothing so there's no native article just tell people what you believe and then let the world worry about the rest what are the trumpets look like a great joyous time instead of that it's horrible killings and horrible things happening around the world that's god's infinite mercy and love for israel that's hard to understand why didn't he just swoop them all up and just put them all in a little cubicle you know and just carry back over to israel set them down now i don't have to explain that i don't think because you know what would have happened the next airplane 90 of them would have been on their way back where they come from right come on are you serious but see when god drove them there now that's their home their land they're fighting for every inch how about it are you fighting for every inch of ground you can get now in this message are you just that classically lazy around i'm not studying what we got 288 288 in the red book anybody have a need and never persecutions is is anybody else right here do you want somebody be concerned about is um anybody else anybody oh happy forever
