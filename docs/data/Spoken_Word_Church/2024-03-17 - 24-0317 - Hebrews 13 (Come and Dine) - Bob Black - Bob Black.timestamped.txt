[0:00] God bless you
[0:07] Saints it's good to be in the house of
[0:09] the Lord this
[0:14] morning let's go to the Lord in prayer
[0:16] Lord God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:18] gather around your word this morning
[0:20] Lord we just ask Lord that you'll bless
[0:21] the service today Lord help our hearts
[0:24] Lord Jesus Lord that we'll be open to
[0:26] receive what you have in store for us be
[0:28] with us today Lord as we study these
[0:30] things out Grant it now Lord we ask in
[0:32] your name so we uh we're making our way
[0:36] through Hebrews 13 and we're on Hebrews
[0:39] 13:9 uh we got a little bit past this
[0:42] last Sunday but I'm just going to
[0:43] backtrack just just briefly and just to
[0:46] meditate on some of these verses where
[0:49] Paul is saying be not carried about with
[0:51] diverse and strange
[0:54] doctrines for it is good it is a good
[0:57] thing that the heart be established with
[0:59] Grace now now think about what he's
[1:01] saying here the heart the heart be
[1:03] established with Grace not with Meats
[1:06] now see he's comparing the inside and
[1:08] the outside here not with Meats which
[1:11] have not profited them that have been
[1:12] occupied therein and then you know with
[1:15] we we kind of looked at last time the uh
[1:18] last week how
[1:19] that and the the Hebrew rituals of the
[1:22] Old Testaments were to make sure that to
[1:25] compare the different kind of meats that
[1:27] you don't eat something that was offer
[1:29] offered to an idol don't eat this and uh
[1:31] separate the uh clean and the unclean
[1:34] food and all all that kind of thing they
[1:35] have got all their rituals for the meat
[1:38] the meats that you would eat but he's
[1:41] saying what what's going to help the
[1:43] inside what's going to help the your
[1:45] heart and you know you you think as you
[1:48] study these things out that there's
[1:50] there's meat for the soul and there's
[1:52] meat for the Flesh and you can be so
[1:54] concerned about the meat for the Flesh
[1:57] and and uh that you're trying to clean
[2:00] up the outside clean up uh take care of
[2:03] the outside thing that you're not
[2:04] concerned about what what's going to
[2:06] benefit the
[2:07] inside I was thinking about in John John
[2:10] was it John chapter 4 where Jesus was
[2:12] talking to the woman at the well and
[2:14] after he got done talking to her his
[2:16] disciples came up and they said Master
[2:17] we got some food for you master eat they
[2:20] had gone to get some food and he said
[2:21] I've got food that you don't know I've
[2:23] got meat that you don't know anything
[2:25] about and so so there we can see and of
[2:28] course if you go on St that out the meat
[2:30] the meat that he was talking about was
[2:31] to do the will of the father and of
[2:34] course his will is found in his word so
[2:37] you've got meat that can that can
[2:39] benefit your soul that can clean up your
[2:42] soul change your soul and meet things on
[2:46] the the external I think that kind of
[2:48] goes along with exactly what brother
[2:49] Andrew was preaching yesterday that
[2:51] there's a there's a fire of God and that
[2:53] can clean up the inside let's worry
[2:55] about the inside there's a lot of things
[2:57] you you get so concerned with the things
[2:58] on the outside that like like last time
[3:01] we were illustrating with Cain bringing
[3:03] his fruits first you bring try to try to
[3:06] try to satisfy God's word and so forth
[3:08] with the fruits with the works first and
[3:10] that's just not the right pattern but if
[3:12] you do like Abel and and try to get the
[3:14] soul right get the inside right then the
[3:17] outside will naturally take take care of
[3:19] itself get get the inside right and
[3:23] those are the things that Jesus was
[3:24] talking about when he preached to the
[3:25] Pharisees where these are things we're
[3:26] all familiar with what you scribes and
[3:28] Pharisees that you like why did supples
[3:31] the outside's taken care of but on the
[3:34] inside it's it's like a real pretty
[3:36] Garden all the outside's pretty there's
[3:38] the the grave is painted but on the
[3:40] inside it's full of dead men's bones and
[3:43] all un cleanness or like a a a cup or a
[3:46] platter that on the outside it's nice
[3:48] and clean but on the inside it's like
[3:50] who would want to drink out of that
[3:52] that's nasty full of ravness and
[3:54] wickedness so so again what Paul's
[3:56] talking about is there's meat for the
[3:58] inside and there's meat for the outside
[4:00] don't be so concerned about the outside
[4:02] get the inside taken care of clean the
[4:05] inside in Matthew chapter 15 Jesus said
[4:08] but those things which proceed out of
[4:10] the mouth come forth from the heart it's
[4:11] the heart is the problem and they defile
[4:14] the man for out of the heart proceede
[4:17] evil thoughts murderers adulteries
[4:21] fornications thefts false witness
[4:25] blasphemies see if you try to tackle
[4:27] that from the outside well I'm going to
[4:28] not I'm I'm not going to tell a lie
[4:30] today I'm not going to uh do anything
[4:33] wrong I'm going to try to keep myself
[4:36] but your inside is still cankered and is
[4:38] still messed up then eventually
[4:40] eventually it's going to work itself out
[4:43] these are the things which defile a man
[4:45] Jesus said but to eat with unwashed
[4:47] hands defileth not a man in other words
[4:48] he's saying don't Focus so much on the
[4:50] external it's not eating something with
[4:52] unclean hands that will defile you but
[4:54] what will defile you is that rotten
[4:57] cankered inside that can only be fed by
[5:01] the meat of the word of God now that's
[5:05] what Paul's point is there's meat for
[5:07] the inside and meat for the outside L's
[5:10] be concerned with the meat for the
[5:11] inside and that's why we're all gathered
[5:13] here this morning as we want some meat
[5:15] we want some good old gospel food
[5:17] that'll feed our soul and change our
[5:19] soul in Romans Chapter 2 he said for he
[5:22] is not a Jew Paul's laying this out he's
[5:23] not a Jew which is one
[5:25] outwardly the outward is not the thing
[5:28] that makes you a good Christian or Jew
[5:31] or whatever neither is that circumcision
[5:33] which is outward In the Flesh that was
[5:36] the Old Testament way trying to satisfy
[5:38] things by The Works of the law trying to
[5:40] do do and keep all the Commandments but
[5:42] he is a Jew which is one inwardly and
[5:45] circumcision is that of the heart in the
[5:47] spirit and not in the letter whose
[5:50] praise is not of men but of God Amen now
[5:54] in Hebrews 13:10 Paul says this this
[5:58] this verse is a little bit hard to kind
[5:59] of wrap our minds around but let's
[6:00] meditate on this we've got an altar
[6:04] we've got an altar whereof they have no
[6:06] right to eat which serve the
[6:09] Tabernacle That Old Testament Tabernacle
[6:12] I got a picture here of they they bring
[6:14] their sacrifice and they lay their
[6:16] sacrifice up on that Altar and now the
[6:19] priest had the right if it was a peace
[6:20] offering a different kind of rule peace
[6:22] if it was a PE peace offering the breast
[6:24] is mine and the right thigh is mine and
[6:26] he could take that grab the hook and
[6:28] grab some of that food off and and that
[6:29] was his to eat and you could eat off of
[6:32] that sacrifice that was brought to the
[6:33] altar now so Paul's saying we've got an
[6:36] altar now they don't have any right to
[6:38] eat of this altar that we're talking
[6:41] about now in the Old Testament they
[6:42] could e eat off that Old Testament altar
[6:45] but now we've got a new testament altar
[6:48] now I I just want to change gears for a
[6:50] second and point out that brother
[6:51] brandham would always use this scripture
[6:55] whenever he preached his life
[6:57] story so let's read the scripture that
[6:59] he would read before he preached his
[7:00] life story we've got an altar where of
[7:03] they have no right to eat which serve
[7:04] the Tabernacle for the bodies of those
[7:07] beasts whose blood is brought into the
[7:09] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[7:11] burned without the camp think about why
[7:14] brother Brandon would use this scripture
[7:15] as he preached his life story that his
[7:17] whole message was to feed us to give us
[7:20] something that that we could eat of that
[7:22] they didn't have access to if they were
[7:23] looking at from a legalistic standpoint
[7:26] but we've got some real Eagle food that
[7:29] they don't have a right to eat we've got
[7:31] something that we we're we're going
[7:33] beyond the camp of man's ideas and the
[7:35] camp of our own ideas the denominational
[7:38] system we're going outside of the
[7:40] outside of the camp to get this food see
[7:44] he said for the bodies of those beasts
[7:45] whose blood is brought into the
[7:47] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[7:48] burned without the camp wherefore Jesus
[7:51] also that he might sanctify the people
[7:53] with his own blood suffered without the
[7:55] gate let us go forth therefore unto him
[7:57] without the camp bearing his reproach
[8:00] for here we have no continuing City but
[8:01] we seek one to come now I think that
[8:04] that's the theme of of pretty much what
[8:06] brother Ram's whole Ministry was about
[8:08] to take us beyond the camp to get some
[8:11] food that you couldn't eat if you're
[8:13] looking at it from a a legalistic step
[8:15] trying to satisfy the works but this
[8:17] food is for our soul to change our soul
[8:20] to build up our
[8:21] faith we have an altar whereof they have
[8:24] no right to eat which serve the
[8:25] Tabernacle and there's the the priest
[8:27] bringing us bringing the uh doing the
[8:29] the rights were the the sacrifice is
[8:32] being brought and he's got a right to
[8:34] take some of
[8:35] that some of the animal for his food to
[8:39] eat of the
[8:42] sacrifice eating is partaking and we'll
[8:45] just we'll just labor this just for a
[8:46] moment in Revelation Chapter 2 it says
[8:48] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[8:50] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[8:52] him that I overcometh will I give to eat
[8:54] of the tree of life amen and Proverbs
[8:57] chapter 9 says come eat of my bread
[9:00] and drink of the wine which I have
[9:01] mingled and Isaiah 55 says oh everyone
[9:04] that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and
[9:07] he that ha no money Come Ye and buy and
[9:10] eat Y come buy M wine and milk without
[9:13] honey and without price so we've got an
[9:16] altar where of they have no right to eat
[9:18] what serve the Tabernacle what's the
[9:20] altar the altar is where the sacrifice
[9:23] is
[9:25] made and where the sacrif where our
[9:27] sacrifice is made is on the cross so
[9:31] what this means is if you continue to
[9:33] adhere to your that legalistic way of
[9:35] thinking or trying to satisfy the
[9:36] outside man by serving the Tabernacle
[9:40] you don't have access to the spiritual
[9:42] benefits you don't have a right to eat
[9:43] of this New Covenant and you can
[9:46] probably see where I'm going with my
[9:48] lesson we're eating we're eating the
[9:50] body word of the Flesh of the son of man
[9:53] we're that's the altar that we're eating
[9:54] at that's and when you eat from that
[9:57] then you've got access to these benefits
[10:00] you got access to these these new
[10:01] testament benefits that they had no
[10:03] access to in the Old Testament that the
[10:06] New Testament gives you access to these
[10:08] B what what kind of benefits you've got
[10:10] now You' got a guide to the truth You'
[10:12] got a comforter you've got the Holy
[10:14] Ghost as your teacher you got power to
[10:16] overcome and live a holy life you got
[10:18] you got when you need to go in prayer
[10:20] you got a helper like in Romans chapter
[10:22] 8 it says likewise the spirit also
[10:24] helpeth our infirmities for we know not
[10:27] what we should pray for as we ought but
[10:28] the spirit itself make us intercession
[10:31] for us with groanings which cannot be
[10:33] uttered he he'll uh we've got somebody
[10:36] that'll help bear our burdens we've got
[10:38] a seal that seals Us in and keep seals
[10:40] the Holy Ghost in seals God in our soul
[10:42] and seals the devil out and it will
[10:45] produce fruit in our life and those are
[10:47] the benefits that come from eating off
[10:49] of this new testament Al altar the
[10:52] eating the body word of the sacrifice
[10:54] that died for us that they can't eat
[10:57] from if you're looking still looking for
[10:59] an Old Testament Viewpoint or a
[11:01] Viewpoint of Works will say it like that
[11:04] right so what we're really getting at is
[11:06] in John 6: 53 this this this this uh
[11:11] little sermon that Jesus gave to the
[11:12] ones that were still with him that so
[11:15] many people have pondered at and even
[11:16] today in the a lot of denominational
[11:19] viewpoints like Roman Catholicism they
[11:20] don't they're they're looking at this
[11:22] totally in a carnal way and unable to
[11:24] understand what Jesus was saying here
[11:26] but when he said verily verily I say
[11:28] unto you except you eat the Flesh of the
[11:31] son of man and drink his blood ye have
[11:34] no life in you who so eateth my flesh
[11:38] and drinketh my blood hath eternal life
[11:41] and I will raise him up at the last day
[11:43] for my flesh is meat and deed and my
[11:45] blood is drinking deed he that eateth my
[11:48] flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in
[11:50] me and I in him as the living father has
[11:52] sent me and I live by the father so he
[11:55] that eateth me even he shall live by me
[12:00] I was thinking this morning that you
[12:01] know after Zach got got was received a
[12:04] new birth and he had that he had that
[12:06] dream one night where he was he was
[12:08] sitting in front of that buffet table
[12:09] and it was like you know he was being
[12:11] told you can just eat and eat and eat
[12:14] and that's what we're doing when we when
[12:15] you open up your Bible when you come to
[12:17] church you're just you you've got you've
[12:19] got access to this altar where you can
[12:21] eat of this you can eat of all these
[12:23] spiritual promises because we're eating
[12:26] of the body word of the son of man and
[12:27] we're eating and eating and it's
[12:29] changing us as you eat it changes your
[12:31] nature it changes the way you think it
[12:33] changes everything about you so that you
[12:35] don't even look at the world the same
[12:37] way again you don't look at the problem
[12:38] you eat from The Book of Job and you
[12:40] won't look at the problems in your life
[12:42] the same way anymore because you realize
[12:44] that God's in control and God's over
[12:46] everything and and it changes things
[12:49] that's what the word is it's actually
[12:51] it's actually changing the way that we
[12:53] look at things now look at Hebrews 13:1
[12:55] for the bodies of those beasts whose
[12:58] blood is brought into the sanctuary by
[13:00] the high priest for sin are burned
[13:02] without the camp now here he's he's kind
[13:04] of putting a story in our mind if you
[13:06] want this word you got to go beyond your
[13:10] own think you got to go outside the camp
[13:12] of your ideas and outside the camp of
[13:14] your thinking outside the camp of maybe
[13:16] what the norm is of religion and and all
[13:20] the denominational ideas you got to step
[13:22] outside of that camp to go get this food
[13:25] for the bodies of those beasts whose
[13:27] blood is brought into the sanctuary by
[13:28] the high priest for sin are burned
[13:29] without the camp wherefore Jesus also
[13:32] that he might sanctify the people with
[13:34] his own blood suffered without the gate
[13:38] let us go forth therefore unto him
[13:40] without the camp bearing his reproach oh
[13:45] isn't it worth it's worth all the
[13:46] approach all the mocking to go with him
[13:49] to follow that sacrifice outside the
[13:52] camp cuz that's where he was he he died
[13:54] was outside of the city Gates and and
[13:57] and we've got this this scripture in
[13:59] Leviticus that that kind of talks about
[14:01] how the the sacrifice was the bullet for
[14:03] the sin offering it was it was they took
[14:05] it and they took it outside of the camp
[14:07] to burn it to burn the fire the skins
[14:09] and the Flesh and so forth just like how
[14:11] Jesus was taken outside of the city
[14:13] Gates you can see the map there of the
[14:16] city of Jerusalem it's really hard to
[14:18] see there but there in the upper left is
[14:20] where gol gotha was so they took him um
[14:25] down the streets and mocking him and
[14:27] making fun of him all through the City
[14:29] till they got outside of the gate and
[14:31] that's where they put him up on the on
[14:33] the cross and laughed at him and mocked
[14:36] him and that's the same way with your ex
[14:39] your Christian experience you got to go
[14:42] outside of the
[14:43] camp and brother Ram said in going
[14:45] beyond the camp he said let us go beyond
[14:47] the camp now let us go beyond our own
[14:50] thinking Amen Let Us Go by the thinking
[14:53] of God yes and the Bible said this let
[14:56] the mind that was in Christ be in you so
[14:59] let us think his thoughts not our own
[15:02] thinking because most of the time we're
[15:03] wrong so to be sure let his mind rest in
[15:07] us and his mind was to do the father's
[15:09] will and the father's will is his
[15:11] promised word I just got a couple of
[15:13] circles here that shows the nor the big
[15:15] the big camp but to go outside of that
[15:18] camp where the sacrifice is typified by
[15:20] this little cross there and you're going
[15:23] outside of that outside of the the the
[15:25] way that that you think and everybody
[15:28] else thinks outside of that and going
[15:30] beyond the camp brother R said I know
[15:32] there is some reason that people are not
[15:33] getting through to Christ if they would
[15:35] they wouldn't act like that so what he's
[15:37] saying is that if we get the inside
[15:39] Changed by going being willing to go
[15:42] outside of the camp and get that
[15:44] spiritual
[15:45] food off that altar that we've got
[15:47] access to that will change us and
[15:50] sanctify us and clean us up he said
[15:53] Jesus suffered without the gates that he
[15:55] might sanctify his people with his own
[15:57] blood sanctification comes from a Greek
[16:00] word compound which means clean and set
[16:02] aside for service and when God cleans
[16:05] his people with the blood of Jesus he
[16:07] cleans them from the filth of the world
[16:09] and sets them aside for service aren't
[16:12] you glad for a promise like that this
[16:13] morning that God can clean you up and
[16:15] make you live a real Christian Life
[16:18] scour you up with a baptism of Fire by
[16:21] the Holy Ghost and clean you up so you
[16:22] can live a holy life and that's what
[16:24] that's what going outside the gates does
[16:26] to follow
[16:27] Christ and going out beyond the camp he
[16:29] said let us go beyond the camp tonight
[16:31] Lord and find you I've got a picture
[16:33] here just of like a man leaving a
[16:35] denominational Church like uh you know
[16:37] he he brother R will explain that Exodus
[16:39] is going out leaving going out and then
[16:42] going into But first you got to you got
[16:44] to go beyond the camp you got to leave
[16:47] you got to leave those old ideas and so
[16:48] forth
[16:50] amen and you know if you really think
[16:52] what happened when that in that Exodus
[16:54] when the when the children of Israel
[16:55] left first they escaped the Tyrant of
[17:00] pharaoh and all of his oppression but
[17:03] then they come then they come to the to
[17:06] the uh to the Mount sini where Moses
[17:09] went up to bring the tables of stone
[17:11] down to deliver them from themselves if
[17:14] we go from go beyond the camp from of
[17:17] all that denominational system and the
[17:18] way that people think but if we then
[17:20] keep going beyond the camp to be
[17:22] delivered from your own will and from
[17:24] your own ideas and that's what this
[17:27] message does it changes Chang is
[17:29] everything we'll never find him by
[17:31] joining the church we'll never find him
[17:33] by shaking hands with some minister or
[17:35] signing some Creed or something that we
[17:37] promise all of those things are external
[17:40] to go to Sunday school so many days out
[17:42] of the year and so forth we'll only find
[17:43] him in the word because he is the word
[17:47] sir and as we see this day promised that
[17:49] he would be outside the camp put out
[17:51] again now let us go beyond the camp
[17:53] ready to bear his reproach hated of this
[17:56] world but loved of the one who has
[17:58] invited us to the
[18:00] camp there's another quote where brother
[18:03] R said if there be those here who
[18:05] doesn't know him and has never went
[18:07] beyond the camp of some church
[18:09] affiliation yet you profess to be a
[18:11] Christian but when you say these things
[18:13] I believe as for another day that shows
[18:16] it cannot be the Holy Spirit how can a
[18:18] man that's filled with the holy ghost
[18:20] ever be baptized using the name of
[18:22] Father Son and Holy Ghost when Paul the
[18:25] great Apostle said if an angel comes
[18:27] from Heaven you might have done it one
[18:29] time not knowing any different those
[18:30] people did it not knowing different in
[18:32] Acts 19 but said an angel preaches
[18:34] anything different Let It Be A cursed
[18:38] how can you accept some Creed or some
[18:40] ISM some something another when the
[18:42] Bible said the promise is unto you the
[18:45] same thing the real baptism of the Holy
[18:48] Spirit how can the holy spirit that
[18:49] wrote the word be in you denying the
[18:51] word how can it deny when the very Holy
[18:53] Spirit itself said if any person shall
[18:56] add one word to this or or take anything
[18:59] from it I'll take his part out of The
[19:01] Book of Life how can the Holy Spirit
[19:04] then take anything from the word or add
[19:07] anything to the word we got to go beyond
[19:10] the camp to find Jesus to get to that
[19:14] word that will change our heart amen it
[19:18] seems today brother I'm said to be a day
[19:20] of when people are going beyond the camp
[19:22] and everything they're going Beyond you
[19:24] know I was told some time ago that they
[19:26] had a jet plane now that can makes them
[19:28] noises we hear around here that shakes
[19:30] the windows it's when the plane has got
[19:32] so fast that it crosses its own sound
[19:36] called sound barrier and when it goes
[19:39] beyond its own sound barrier it's almost
[19:42] unlimited to what it'll do now see what
[19:45] he's he's kind of getting our our mind
[19:47] framed up if we go beyond the way that
[19:49] we think and the way all the world
[19:51] religious system we start breaking into
[19:54] breaking past that unbelief barrier
[19:56] breaking into a world where a ring where
[19:59] anything is possible anything is
[20:02] possible breaking past breaking and what
[20:05] what oh he said I think in there that we
[20:06] get a lesson when we go beyond our own
[20:08] sound barrier into the word of God then
[20:12] it's
[20:13] unlimited what God can do with a man
[20:16] that's ready to go beyond the camp the
[20:19] camp of man that it is and I you can see
[20:22] what what kind of what I'm illustrating
[20:23] here as you we're we're going past all
[20:26] all of these things that that we're
[20:28] going going into a realm that will
[20:30] change our bodies change the molecular
[20:32] structure of our bodies change the way
[20:34] that we think you you know brother BR
[20:37] when and I'm going to close on this when
[20:39] the message persevering he talked about
[20:41] that those angels that that appeared and
[20:44] and and uh just before the seals were
[20:46] revealed and that the one of them that
[20:48] he said the one on the right had its
[20:49] wings turned back and if you really look
[20:52] at as an aircraft approaches the speed
[20:54] of sound it sweeping the wings back
[20:57] actually helps to lay the formation of
[21:00] shock wave so that it can break past
[21:02] that sound bar barrier and that he's
[21:04] tying that with going beyond the camp
[21:07] and brother R said him going beyond the
[21:09] camp he said so notice he rebuked them
[21:11] and they put him out of their Camp Jesus
[21:13] suffered without the camp they put him
[21:14] out of the camp outside Way Beyond their
[21:16] camp we find out that the Bible said in
[21:19] this last day under this lotsy and age
[21:22] they would do the same thing they would
[21:24] be put out of the camp and there You'
[21:26] got the picture of the son of man the
[21:28] word that we have that we're eating of
[21:31] the body word outside of the door
[21:33] knocking on the door cuz he's been put
[21:35] out of the
[21:36] church behold I stand at the door and
[21:38] knocked If any man hear my voice and
[21:41] open the door I will come into him and
[21:43] will sub with him and he with with me
[21:46] and there's that analogy again of eating
[21:49] if you'll just open up the door of your
[21:51] heart he'll come in and you can eat with
[21:54] the word eat with Christ and we'll just
[21:58] stop there God bless you
[22:08] Saints
