========================================

god bless you saints you glad to be in the house of the lord this morning it's good to come to church yeah and we're certainly glad to have the porters with us this morning had some good fellowship with them last night and uh really appreciate them trying to figure out how to get my i don't know where my button went so i'll just we'll just carry on like this we've been studying on the book of hebrews and uh and and made it to hebrews chapter six so let's just um i don't know anyway i don't know where my button went but we'll try to make the best of it let's let's pray before we get into our study lord jesus we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word and we just ask lord as we just study out these little verses in hebrews lord that you'll just open it up to us lord and quicken the word to us lord and give us what we have need of this morning as brother wade's studying and preparing lord jesus that our hearts will be an expectation and you'll just be with us today we ask your blessing upon you the reading of your word now in your name so hebrews chapter 6 if we just kind of background on the last few verses it says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and this will we do if god permit for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good work of word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame so just the background briefly we were talking about how paul's saying that let let's you you start on your journey you lay the foundation but let's go on to perfection let's go on to run that race well so you've got your foundation of repentance from dead works and all these all these foundational doctrines of faith toward god and what it means to be born again and how to be baptized and and all of these foundational doctrines but let's let's go on and grow and so he as he as he as we go through this chapter he gets to this this may be difficult like like like what peter said peter would say that many of the things paul said is hard to understand and you get to verse 4 and he says for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened that have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again and repent us so that's maybe a scripture that many have wrestled with over the years so we just want to kind of uh break this down and unpack it this morning and look at all the all the good treasures that are stored up in this verse because it's it's really weighty and you really really just kind of set the stage what what paul's talking here is that the light of the word you have to keep up with it in every age as as martin when martin luther preached his message that was that was that was the light for that age and the people in that age believed what he preached and and and were born again by believing that message in his age but then john wesley got uh showed there was a little bit more light in the word when he began to preach and you got to keep up with the word and if you don't if you don't keep up with the word uh when the word is made manifest in your age and it comes and it's presented plainly before you and you you partake of the you're sitting in church and you're partaking of the holy ghost and yet you don't go on all the way and you to reject and you and you and you come to a place where the word is is plainly before you and you say well i i don't believe it i'm i'm going to turn around and go away and reject it maybe maybe this morning you think as we kind of dive into this think about all the maybe scenarios and and and things that you've seen in your life where where people have maybe preached the preached the message for 40 or 50 years and then all of a sudden they come to a place where you know like like judas or or dathon and cora and they and they come to a place where you know i i i never really believed it to begin with but yet they were partakers of the of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost on their spirit they sat in meetings and rejoiced and yet they they at the end of the road and i see what paul's talking about he's talking about you you got to come to the end your your your end is really when when the fruit is manifested when it when the plant grows up it really shows where you started from so we want our end we want to we want to raise like paul said run this race well because it there's only one that wins the race and that's the the one that crosses the finish line so think of uh when as he was saying in hebrews chapter six verse one let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god so as you're going on it's like like like climbing jacob's ladder and you're moving on climbing up through stages like martin luther john wesley azuza street the headstone and you got to as those lights in that candlestick that brother ram talked about as those messengers preached their message you got to stay aligned with the messenger message for your day as the word it keeps moving on like just like the wheat plant from the the the planting from the the stalk and all the way up to the to the actual grain being manifested again so let's let's kind of dive into that a little bit more he said let's read those verses again three to six and this what we do if god permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost sat in meetings and shouted and more partakers and what are we talking about this morning we're really talking about anointed ones and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame let's uh let's let's let's read that in a different translation the erv and i know sometimes we stumble at different translations and things but you know my my stance on it really is if it'll if it'll help me understand i you know you you you want to be careful of course but if there's anything that can help me understand i want to take advantage of it so this is this is maybe maybe simplified uh a lot but the erv says after people have left the way of christ can you make them change their lives again and paul's talking about people who once learned the truth received god's gift and shared in the holy spirit and and in other words the baptism the holy ghost was was present in their life you think about how the uh when the when the apostles were first commissioned that jesus told them to go cast out devils and preach the gospel and yet they didn't have the new birth yet but they were they were anointed with the with the holy ghost on their spirit to go and cast out devils but without the new birth they were blessed to hear god's good message and see the great power of his new world and but then they left it all behind and it's not possible to make them change again that's because those who leave christ are nailing him to the cross again shaming him before everyone so you see when you when you reject what why did they nail him to the cross to begin with because they rejected his message think of that picture of pilot uh pilot there saying i find no fault in him and they and they went and nailed him to the cross because they rejected him as as they rejected everything he stood for and and what's that what will happen again in the end times they reject his message and that's why brother brown preached that message the indictment i indict this generation for crucifying christ afresh because they rejected his message again the denominational people of the day they they got so they got so uh they cabbage down on the the the what they believed to be the truth and they could not go on with the light as the light of uh the light of the spirit showing more light upon his word they couldn't keep pace with it so brother brown what he would say in the anointed ones at the end time he was in the blades he was in the tassel he was in the shuck but now he's in the grain now you go back and try to live again now he's trying he's trying to elaborate on what paul's saying here in verses three to six what if that like life took back down you think that left life would ever go go talk whatever talk go back after that old shuck has dried up ever go back and live in it again it never does for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and didn't move on with the word as it come to pass they are dead gone and the thorns and thistles which is nigh and rejection whose end is to be burned is that right so he's saying if you don't think think of it like brother brown would say the you know the the psalm says that word to me is a a a lamp to my feet and a light to my path as the it's like a light that's shining where where you should put your foot next and if you don't if you get out of the light that's shining on your path then you're in darkness so you've got to keep pat pace with that light and how do you keep pace with the light is by believing the message for your day that's what that's why brother adam would reiterate over and over again we're not we're not believing noah's message or or moses message or or martin luther's message or john wesley's message but we're believing a present tense revelation for this hour right what's the present tense revelation for this hour what are we supposed to believe in this hour the headstone ministry of the full word being restored the capstone message so as brother bro as martin luther would what the message kept going on from martin luther and martin luther's message was in romans 1 17 that just you're justified by faith and john wesley's message in first thessalonians 5 23 the very god of peace sanctify you holy and azusa street that a promise that the spirit will be restored and and the signs and wonders and things will be restored back to the people but you see you keep climbing up and you've got to keep pace with it and when their eyes were open they knew him he said as i referred last night moses couldn't have come with noah's message neither could jesus come with moses message see it was so it was lauded for each hour now we couldn't come with luther's message neither with the wesley and neither with a pentecostal message we're plumb beyond that you say oh that's something well so did the catholic church think luther was making it up so did wesley think that the the lutheran think that wesley was making it up so did the wesleys think that the pentecost was making it up but the thing of it is look back in the scriptures it identifies every age and if the things that he is doing now doesn't identify him the promises of god then leave it alone you every single one of these messengers could identify their message in the bible and that's the same thing and today we can identify our our message the message that we've heard by looking at malachi 4 and luke 17 and uh revelation 10 and ephesians 4 and and 2nd peter and all of these things as the bible opens up you can identify what you believe by looking at the journey of ruth at the streets three stages of abraham at the three stages of david's life and you can as you as the message opens up it becomes identified in the scripture that that's why he's saying we're not just making stuff up we're not just believing something that just some man came up with but we believe what we're actually believing what the bible says and the message that we've heard has shown light on what the scripture is actually hidden in the scripture so brother brown will say again and he said in questions and answers number three he said there's nobody can say a word against them fine religious people they're just as nice as they can be church of god nazarene free methodists those people are real but when it comes down to the works of the spirit they say oh that's the devil see how you got to keep pace with the message of the hour that's what paul's talking about here in hebrews chapter six and and when you keep pace when you're believing the message for your day and and the message for your day actually opens up to you and you begin to see what the prophet in this day really was preaching about that and we'll find out that brother brown said that is really the evidence of the new birth that the message for your day is revealed to you and he'll say so there's nobody can say a word against them people they're nice people in the in all the different denominations but when it comes down to the works of the spirit they say that's the devil just like they did when jesus was manifested in the flesh when he walked on the place they looked at his life and they said well that's bl's above and that's you're you're that uh i said all the different kind of things about him the pharisees with all their the their all all their their spiritual religious works but yet they could deny the word when it was made plain before them and he said what'd they do there blaspheme the holy ghost now what is blasphemy there's no forgiveness he said he that once enlightened made partakers and tasted of the heavenly gifts tasted of god's sanctification cleaned up from cigarettes and filthy women and all kinds of life like that and tasted of the heavenly things to see that they'll walk up to that borderline like those spies did that eat part of the grapes but what do they have to do they had to break up their denomination to come over into this and what it all boils down into is that they rejected the word when it was presented plainly before them even though the spirit was working in their life and maybe they could cast out devils and maybe they were preaching the gospel that yet when the word was presented in before them they rejected it and so brother brahman in the message indictment he said now the same they do the same today they deny and crucify the same god today by not knowing him the same by denying him and doing by denying the things that they're doing today they don't crucify christ again exactly but they blaspheme the holy ghost and if we skip down to the last paragraph he said and jesus said i'll forgive you for that but when the holy ghost has come remember it will and cannot by no means no mercy when you blaspheme and call the spirit of god the word of god that's being vindicated by the spirit though see the word says so the spirit is vindicating it and you call it an unclean thing you've crossed the line between mercy and judgment and can never be forgiven for it to reject what god has done for you and you you see what what it really is in every age to receive the message for your day is the evidence of the new birth so if you come all the way through justification and look at that path of a christian from through justification and sanctification all those things are works of the holy spirit in your life it takes the holy of the holy ghost to speak to a person and cause them to turn around start going in a different direction through justification and to begin confess that jesus christ has forgiven them of their sins it takes the work of the holy spirit in their life to begin to drive out the cigarettes and clean up their life and all those things in sanctification it's it's god actually doing it in a believer's life where they come to church and they want to start going to church and they want to be religious and they want to act like a christian they want to do right and so they're partaking of the holy ghost the holy ghost is maybe anointing them maybe they start they they feel like they should be a preacher and they start preaching but yet you you've the the the the hone in time the the the the the question is have you received the word for your day and that's the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost that the the new birth in a believer's life so brother brahman's murder in church he said now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives now see that doesn't mean just say well i believe god sent a prophet but that's to believe what that prophet brought to receive that into your heart and let it become let it become manifest in your life so that your works change and your life changes and you're acting different and thinking different to receive the word for the age in which he lives now see where's that in the bible in revelation chapter 3 verse 22 says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and how is he going to say anything to the churches by those seven messengers he said it to the churches he spoke it to the churches by paul and irenaeus and martin columba and luther and wesley and now through brother branham he spoke it to us and that's how you know what he won't say to the church because you listen you listen to what the messenger said and you subject yourself to the word for your age and it becomes fruitful in your life now you think about all the examples of of of these scriptures that paul's talking about that have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open chain examples in the scripture of word rejecters people that benefited from the from the supernatural working in their life like dathan and cora and in the old testament that walked with the children of israel through through the wilderness and they saw the pillar of fire and they ate the manna but yet they refused to believe that they could go into the promised land that refused to accept the message that moses was preaching the 10 line spies that said well we're not able to take it after all the the evidence that they had seen that the word had been laid out plainly before them and they saw the the water come from the rock and they saw bread food prepared for them and every every material need met and yet they failed to believe that god's word was true and judas that walked and talked with jesus and was so close to him until brother and said nobody knew the difference the only one that knew what was really in jesus's heart was jesus and he walked with him and and cast out devils and was with him the whole time and and it and until the very end when he rejected the word you think about the the self-righteous pharisees too that thought that they knew what god wanted done with the word like in mark chapter 12 it said then they said unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words and when they were come they say unto him master we know that thou art true they were confessing that jesus was true and care is for no man that for thou regardless not the person of men but teach us the way of god and truth but yet they couldn't go on with the word they benefited they benefited from his ministry but they couldn't go on with the word that's why paul's saying in verse 4 it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost in mark chapter 3 he ordained 12 that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils see they were once enlightened and they were partakers of the holy ghost in luke chapter 22 and while he had spake behold a multitude of he and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto jesus to kiss him because if a man so close to jesus that he would betray him with a kiss so close to jesus and the seed of discrepancy brother brown said judas only played church he wasn't really sincere he didn't actually have faith he'd have never betrayed jesus but see he sowed that seed of discrepancy he thought that he could make friends with the world mammon and also have friendship with jesus but it was too late for him to do anything about it when the dead hour came when he did this evil thing he crossed the separating line between going forward and returning back and then the sardisian church age brother ram said you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the word there are people who seem involved in the things of god almost 100 percent they are like judas no one but jesus knew exactly what kind of a person judas was so the day came that judas did exactly what israel did at bail pior he decided that he wanted to join with the false divine forces enter into the financial political organization of anti-word anti-christ religion and he did so he was fooled the other 11 were not they could not be for they were of the very elect so when judas left and betrayed the lord his name was removed from the book of life what's what's the difference between a fake a fake and a genuine christian both can rejoice in the spirit both can come into church and and take advantage of the of the spirit movement in the church but a genuine a genuine will have that seed sown down in their heart and the pergamian church agent said now let me tell you and you know hebrews chapter six is the is the answer when brother brown uh he he told that story of of uh seeing the two men rejoicing and and one was living in sin and one was doing uh things wrong i think living in adultery and and uh and the lord took him over to the side and and began to reveal him uh uh turned him uh took him over to hebrews chapter six and he's telling this story he said he were two men one of which was a real believer and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts of the spirit i was troubled by this confusing confusion and he said i left the meeting to seek god for the answer i went along to a secret place and there with my bible i prayed and waited on god for the answer not knowing just what portion of scripture to read i casually opened the bible someplace in matthew i read for a while and then laid the bible down and a moment a wind blew into the room and turned the pages of the bible to hebrews chapter 6. i read it through and was particularly impressed by those strange verses he said he told the story about how man went and sewed wheat and another man went behind him and sowed tears and the wheat and the tares grew together and they particularly the same nourishment out of the same soul they drank in the same sun and rain and then he said i knew the truth then i knew the truth of the camp meeting and the vision the parable of the sower and the seed the sixth chapter of hebrews and the evident manifestation of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all became wonderfully clear the sower in white was the lord the sower in black was the devil the world was the field the seeds were people elect and reprobate both partook of the same nourishment water and sun both prayed both received help from god for he maketh his son and reign to fall on both good and evil and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both have the same wonderful manifestations they will steal that great want that one great difference they were of different seed you see there's what makes the difference what seed you're of i see he he's providing an example that you know usually when brother around would talk about seed there's there's two different ways that he's going the same way with scripture there's see there's seed that god thought of you before the foundation of the world but that had to be that word had to be sown into your heart so that that seed that's sown into your heart he's speaking of now what seed have you received into your heart because all the baptisms of the holy ghost and your spirit and on your flesh that's wonderful to get into a congregation and to rejoice with other believers but have you received the message for your day have you heard what the spirit wants to say to the church because when you sit subject yourself to the word for your day that is the true evidence of the holy ghost in your life the musicians can go ahead and come forward and we'll we'll uh let me skip through some of these before and we'll just close you see on the uh on the on these people that turn back their their body and their spirit maybe were anointed by the holy ghost but down in their soul it was still black but when you receive the word for your age and the spirit quickens it in your soul and comes to life that is the true evidence of the new birth and we'll just stop right there god god bless you all [Applause] so you
