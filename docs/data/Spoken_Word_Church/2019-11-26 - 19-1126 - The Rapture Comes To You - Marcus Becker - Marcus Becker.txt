[Music] we've seen the blood we've seen it made manifest we've seen Christ made alive in hearts and lives Amen good to see everybody the house of the Lord made it through the weekend you made it

anyway who I appreciate that it was really good you took care of him and took care of everything we appreciate all of that - it all right are we ready to hear the word we're glad that brother Marcus could be with us tonight and minister unto us and just pray that the Lord would open his eyes and give him understanding that he may speak to our hearts and lives because that's what we desire that's what we're here for we're here to hear the word of the Lord and I remember the announcements coming up it won't be you know this is coming up Sunday first right see so we've got everything going you

oh yeah [Music] [Music] [Applause] I want to see [Music] now by the music maybe softly is playing let's just bow our heads if you wouldn't mind and if somebody wants that the Lord speaks to him or her person you just raise your hands to God Heavenly Father we so much love these songs father we are already inspired father to pronounce your name and your grace and how great you are and how wonderful you are father may you just speak to our hearts this evening Lord as you lay down my heart to have a real Thanksgiving father Lord may you bless each and every one that is here may you bless your people Israel father and natural Israel the spiritually Israel your bride father Lord we lay ourselves into your presence and say lord help us to go forward to go on father and so we lay everything into your hands ask it in Jesus name Amen god bless you and while we're standing let's open the word of the Lord and you have already heard in the prayer I have quite an accent and you just take what I want to say instead of what I'm saying but let's take let's open in the first book of Kings chapter 19 verse 1 and behold and a hap told Jesse Bell all that Elijah had done and without how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then Jesse belt sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the God do for me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by the morrow about this time when he saw that he aroused and went for his life and came to birth Sheba which belongs to Judah and left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now O Lord take away my life for I am NOT better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said and said unto arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake Baken on the coals in a crucial of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee may the Lord at his blessing to the reading office work we may be seated it's fine for me to put up this jacket thank you very much because I know already have to go to work and therefore now greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's my great honor after five years to be here back again but the date was aways and you always had some kind like a place in my heart and this church and the Wednesday when I was here and remember was preaching about God remembers and exactly so and so I bring you greetings from my pastor about the road walled and I was here for some meetings over there in Ohio and just connected this time a little bit together and thank you for giving me the time I know it means a lot to do to just invite somebody to show the confidence I truly appreciate this and blessed be the name of the Lord I think brother Lewis and his family for all his friendship and I contacted him that I would be around in the area and it seems that brother Lewis is very proud of his pastor and about this congregation that's what he said yes and that makes it easy because it seems that that and I I'm sure that we have exactly the same vision and in many many things and so I will I will enter directly into the service if you wouldn't mind and we wish you from our hearts God's blessing I hope I don't have to present myself in a certain way we have no message of our own and I hope I'm not hurting your feelings by feeling the message of the hour does not come from America it comes from the presence of all my dear and then exactly so on but but this evening I had that subject on my heart and I'm stopping there where I'm continuing there where I stopped in over there in Ohio I would like to talk this evening about our Father I mean and about a true Thanksgiving I want you to warm our hearts again when we go into the Thanksgiving Day Thanksgiving was in vests invented I think by Lincoln is that correct by Abraham Lincoln Washington or Lincoln one of both and he invented that day of he said as a commemoration of the Living God who gave us that country but it became a barbecue day it became a hunting day it became a dis linen day but this evening we want to think about our Father there's something we have in common with our Father even we might see things a little bit different but we have a wonderful father therefore the depth of we have the same chemistry because we have the same father so please keep in mind that I have one service I'm not I'm not making a teaching but I always like to certainly certainly show a little bit of a picture so keep always one thing in mind if a minister has one service in 90 minutes or a little bit less I don't want to take too much out on a Wednesday he cannot bring all the aspects he cannot bring all the balance in all things so bear with me I don't have a special doctrine my father is my doctrine okay you say brother Marcus what kind of doctrine do you have nearer my God to thee that's our doctrine now and say even so let us directly go into into that subject I would like to add call a name that that sermon i don't say i'm preaching messages i'm preaching sermons because the message is preached but that's just a question of the busy expression the rapture comes to you it's not that you are doing something to come into the rapture but the Red River comes to you amen the rapture now now in the time of Jesus the resurrection was an event and was a person jesus said I am the resurrection it's not only when it is a person and we see today the rapture is not only an event it's a person he is the rapture and we as brother Bheema said she becomes him the bride is the rapture in in herself exactly so so in that in that in it at the same time it is an event certainly now that that sermon about what happened here but the Branham preached at different times and he called it what does thou here Elijah and what does thou here Elijah and it it is the story about a man who after his great and tremendous victory over 400 preachers and tied as to what happened in brother branham's meaning at the beginning of his ministry 400 preachers in Chicago who see exactly the parallel the time of the evening comes and he's slaughtering all these kind of people and the next day and I say in my own word he got an email of Jezebel and said look the next morning we will do the same what you did to my priest and something happened to that man it was the same God it was the same doctrine it was the same church it was the same Israel but brother Branham said the anointing left the man and that can happen to all of us we have our strong days and we have our weak days we have them and we see that when he went into the wilderness he took his servant with him and after a certain time he left his servant and went alone and brother Brahim said people who come into this condition they want to stay alone that is the moment when they are leaving church they shouldn't do this but it's a human reaction on a situation that I cannot handle brother Ben didn't dramatize that dramatic alized that situation he said his nerves were at the end not more all was well with his soul all was well with God all was well with the message of the hour but his nerves came to an end brother branham explains in the sixties what we would call today a break out brain brain a burn out sister sin that he showed it was too much pressure and ember of the brain says this I never spoke to so much tired people than today and it ties it to a burnout of the people in the 60s now what would he tell today I mean now look sometime and I'm very happy about this good atmosphere but sometime you preach on a Wednesday service and after 15 minutes people begin to sleep it was not the bad preach because I didn't hear anything to preach about but they sleep already because it's it's a it's it's hardness of the people but if they would watch Super Bowl they wouldn't sleep you see you have to understand whenever you come into a church there is a fight going on and you sit down and Satan comes and and therefore we should be awake we should be there and you say Amen but it's it's it's a sign of that time and what happened is he wanted to be alone and he came to the point that he wanted you just to die and that was the moment when God had to react brother Bram said if you are on your post of duty God is determined or he is obligated to help us exactly so so God did not send a social worker God didn't send an evangelist to say come on you have the message of here come come come come no no that was not helpful I told it again before there was a great pianist by the name of Arthur Rubinstein and after Rubinstein was asked the question is it difficult to play piano he says playing piano is very simple you just have to put down the right keys at the right time so simple it's so simple it's now you know just the right key cetera so it's already there while you studied you just have to make the right thing so so to have a spiritual leadership to help a person in a depressed way it's very simple you just have to be the right person at the right time in the right place at the right spirit saying the right thing and he must be in the right spirit to receive you in the right way so it's very simple sometime if we go to difficult stages in our life no word is the best word that is not a time when I need biblical verses or slogans even not a quotation that's fine but it must be the right word at the right time if not it even hurts even more my feeling so God knew this God's came down and send an angel God is help willingly to help his children now this is the this is the thought of this whole evening in you wills we will see it in the message when you did your best when do you did your best and you come to the end brother Branham says God will send the same angel to you we would see this even in God is not sitting in heaven and said I will see who will make it was the rapture no God will find his children and you you do you do your part and he will do his spots you do your part you don't put your hands in the pockets Eddie no you do your part but be sure you will not make it without God no matter how long hair we have no matter what we do no matter how if God doesn't come down to help us we will not make it can you say Amen that brother mem said if you did your best and you're finished God will send the same angel hallelujah so that angel he had something to eat now first he laid him down sleeping coming down his nerves but the brem said I'm right now myself under the juniper tree he said that that that prophet needed some rest and some care and brother brems that God sent I say in my own words send the angels was the nicest hand just to care about him it's just - here's my prophet knees worn-out he's broken just lift him up again that's our Father he's taking care of us now why he was laying there and he woke the angel woke him up and there was he gave him something to eat some cookies and brother Brahim said he said I want to know which vitamins were in those cookies because with the power of those cookies he went 40 days and 40 nights can you say Amen let's be the name of the Lord remember this the message that we believe is not a doctrine it's not a book of behavior the message is our Father speaking to us he just used a vessel but the origin comes from our Father now if a man loves a woman and he writes her as some love letters now that woman will not embrace the postman she will embrace the one who let who wrote the letter can you say Amen therefore we are not Branagh mites we are not premised we did not we do not marry Eliezer Amen but it was only Eliezer bringing us to a to Isaac which is Christ the word but the bride marries Isaac and unfortunately good people trying to marry Eliezer brother Brennan but that's not so we marry the word can you say Amen so there was something special in those cookies and I always say this in my word the message that we believe is red bull it's red bull now I was I was a small boy when I was I was in school and I remember that that I had a little bit complexes because I was just a smaller than a very thin boy so I had two favorites in my life that was are not Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone so and and I made some kind like a bodybuilding at that time and I want to tell you brothers not to be funny but is a true sphere I want to speak to the young brothers everything that you see here was here but this was just a trim just a changing of this will say so so you can you can work out whatever you want but one day it will be here so don't invest too much time in body but you can do this nothing against but soul building is much more important don't forget the so big exactly so and I remember that I was seeing a film of Arnaud Schwarz I think it was Conan and he was just using his breast muscle like this and that was a young boy and made bodybuilding and I went before the mirror but but nothing was moving so I had to I had to add add to it had to work out again so but what I found out is if you want to have muscles you cannot eat McDonald's and if you want to have spiritual muscles you cannot eat Facebook and you cannot eat whatsapp the whole day that's fine Ivan what's a part you need a spiritual food in due seasons it's the right message can you say Amen so therefore it's so so so wonderful now that scenery that we have seen here now tie to our time when the angel of revelation 10 comes down and what does he have any sense something to eat keep the book and you will have strength to make the journey therefore we have so much weak people in this message because they just join to say I'm in the Messi that's not enough you have to eat the book you have to feed yourself figure soul heart because face has hair on its chest that's what the Prophet said can you say Amen so that's that so important God did not leave his prophet alone God wasn't just there and say ok that's your problem God said in heaven now you stood from me now I still for you brother sister it matters to serve the Lord it matters to come to church it made us to pay try thinks it matters to pray because God remembers those things they say Amen every person who doesn't pay that tithing shows he has no revelation about God it's not it's not it's not a law food is not a legalistic thing it's a question of understanding who my father is and how my father will bless me for every penny can you say Amen so our life will be part of our life will express our revelation now the message comes to you because one thing is clear brother Branham did not only reveal people's life your name is Eva and I'll see you in a car accident that was the first and the second poll but brother Branham revealed the heart of God and I want you to put on a spiritual jacket because it seems to be like a little funny story but it's the stairs the truths behind brother Branham was around mighty man mighty man from the Bible College and they made a little bit fun of him and saying brother Brahim you don't know your Bible because these people God Lindsay and so they could speak Hebrew Greek whatever men so that let me know brother pray me you don't know your Bible like you should a number of the men said this I may not know the Bible like I should but I know the author of the Bible and we say like that's a funny slogan because we think about Pentecostal things and and and and here's the healing and here's the healing here see but what does he say he said I know the nature of the one who wrote the book and you will first understand the buyer if you know the nature of the one who wrote it do you understand it and then we will see the nature of this message because if we have the message without the nature of God we become dogmatic we become hearts we become arrogant we become Pharisees I mean all we become worldly all things everything will be hard but if you understand how our Father things then we think I want to be like you can you say Amen this message reveals how our what Martin Luther could have preached I mean even Paul could not afraid it's a mystery amen which was held junior section said never was light upon that white rock never ever since that since the foundation of the world evening Paul never revealed it that is that is because it's our time some of the things is revealed in our time because it was never able before how many therefore I told the weekend you see the book of Esther Esther never was mentioned in the Bible in New Testament Paul never mentioned it Martin Luther said the book of Esther should be thrown into the river that's what he said because as the book of Esther first is a feminist book second instead it's a Jewish book to Jewish third God is not even mentioned in the whole book they're formed of devil he said now this book of Esther should be thrown into the river now brother Brennan picks it up and preaches and shows we added Esther I mean because he speaks about the marriage of the lamb and speaks about s that's our time of marriage that we live can you say Amen because this is a special time who is Esther we are Esther can you say Amen now our Father has a nature and I want to say this it is right to brag upon our Father and we want to do it this evening and I'm not the only one I'm just a preacher but we can just say now our brother Marcus that is nothing than the truth because our father is such a wonderful person haria they say men so so before I show you and I I make it really convincing that don't be don't be don't be don't don't don't don't be afraid but I want to show you why God had to come down into this generation hallelujah keep these things in mind we're still waiting for him to come keep a balance Christ has come but we are still waiting for him to meet him in the air okay keep a balance in all things okay for me it is not meeting in the air let me say traveling beside the moon is for me it's a changing of dimension but that is Marcus if somebody somebody told me brother Marcus I see different and I said okay let's both go into the rapture and we will see how it was okay but but I always keep a balance in those things so let me just show you some of the pictures to understand what happened to the message of the hour and why a message believer cannot go back into a denomination there's no way if he says okay there is Jesus - then I want to say brother you never understood anything from the beginning or sister and we will see - he cannot go back into a former age is not possible because there's nothing to find there it's just a mirage it's just a nostalgic way of thinking about things that are not real anymore can you say Amen hallelujah and maybe if the brothers would help me to - just - just - just now that is that is the thing that is the pyramid that brother Branham was was was was showing in the message the stature of a perfect man and the only thing that I was doing is is is showing the anointings and the messengers not more exactly so just put it in right now now now we have to understand one thing that the birth of the church was a Pentecost as what the Prophet says now between the birth of the church in the first churches were twenty years and brother brems says in the resume of the church he said the church was already a fallen woman I'm exactly so and there is a beginning in the church you see brother Marcus how how do you know this now I show you by the Bible that no apostle understood who the first messenger was now as Paul was not in the upper room brother Branham was not in Azusa Street both came later brother Brahim did not come to bring a Pentecostal revive because the Pentecostal was already on without a prophet being there both had to fall in order to show there must be something deeper and higher and bigger than he thinks so my question is why should I turn back to something that fell in the beginning now I always say this the timing that we live there was never a day than this day before I mean right but the beginning of the church was at Pentecost so blessed be the name of the Lord and Paul came to lay a foundation he said I was born I was sent to be a wise masterbuilder to lay a foundation but you cannot live in a house which just has a foundation you need the walls and at the end you have to put on a roof on that house and then it becomes a house so so even that they're dead that's Logan let's go back to Pentecost it's nothing wrong with the slogan as long as we understand that we have young people in this message in there need a new verse there neither Holy Ghost because we have some of the youngsters they are just religious in the message therefore they try to be as worldly as the aunts to come to church because they were never called they need a beginning they need a foundation brother ever 16 years old daughter I don't want to see him religious in the message I want her to catch the vision that she can say that god of my father is my god the joy of my father is my joy can you say Amen so back to Pentecost yes but not back to a former age but not back 200 or 2000 years ago not at all because God never goes back God goes forward and the Prophet said you cannot live a life looking into the real mirror mirror you have to go forward so the slogan back to penny because it is in order as as long as it is placed correctly if it's not placed correctly you go back into a mirage and we're not doing this can you say Amen because this is a tremendous as the time of a capping of the pyramid this is now we had seven messengers our two messengers were special because only miss only one messenger was able to write the Bible that was Paul all the other ones were just reformist and the seventh one was able to reveal the seven thunders and here we're special only the seventh one had the third Pole only the seventh one had the ability to create all the rest brother brother said to me brother knows but there were signs and wonders signs and wonders were already in the Old Testaments and where do you want to go back to Judaism or what I mean we have something that they never had before this is Sir Paul time this was the birth of the church but now we live in the adoption now we're living the invisible unity of Christ and his bride it's a special time and we are not despised in the beginning not at all it's tremendous but we have more than they ever had none of the apostle in the first church age said look Peter never said look stop gentlemen stop with our counsel we have a messenger here Paul is the first message of God blindly had at the eyes because when Paul would have been in the first church age they would have very wretched they would they would have already gone into the rapture they would have never been seduced okay say but God allowed because in Georgia 2019 are still predestinated see they have to come and God kept the door open he said look can you say Amen therefore I said what I said this morning or this weekend we don't have a pope in this message if somebody feels to be a Pope we should change the church go to the Catholic Church the actual pope is relatively old maybe you can get its job later but I don't know if you make it and what we don't have is a Sanhedrin Council in the message if it's not in the message at all if people think they can they will Debbie said let's go back to the UPC they have it or please go back to Judaism we have neither Apple nor we have a have a council every Church its sovereign before God they say Amen let's be the name of the Lord therefore in in the plan of God never nobody preached you in and nobody will preach you out if this church is God's will nobody will preach the church all of the message we said my brother maybe you see it different but God placed us here and you discuss with my father about it can you say Amen so there's no Pope in the message in there's no Sanhedrin Council who thinks now to me this is messaging this is not brother go home you say Amen look this is just a special time in that we live you make the next one please I mean because the rapture comes to you I mean now that's what that's what the Prophet said in in in in revelation chapter one I have to read it myself therefore I was printing out these things just give me a second now he said now if you notice revelation 4:1 we find Jesus standing in the seven church ages the seven golden candlesticks when he turned and saw one like the Son of man standing closed how it was it was the bride standing in the candlestick brought out so if the bride is there and the marriage is there now somebody is missing it's the bridegroom it's a word the entire Holy Ghost must visit the church it's the time that we live in can you say Amen next one please and it's a special time that we live I mean now look at this when God sent the message and the messenger God send them to heal the people God said do not fear I'm sent from the presence of God to tell you that you procured a particular person you're peculiar life has been to indicate yet you are taking a gift of divine healing to the people of the world now make a stop here and think twice God loves human beings that's the nature of our Father and if you have that nature if you are you love people even those who disagree with you because when those people came into the prayer line brother Brendan asked now are you a Christian do you pay your tithe things do this it was just somebody in need and God wants to help somebody who is in need if he's a Muslim is a Muslim let him be what God made him to be but we have a message to go on there's a mess there's a thought that brother Brian said he said life is precious in the eyes of God and you see an unbeliever and we sometimes we think we can step over him but don't step over him don't step over him because for this man is maybe for one little girl her daddy and sure for one mama it's her son and for us that person has no value for about for daddy mama he it is her boy or maybe he says this is madness my papa he's in alcohol problems life is precious in the eyes of God brother we start sometime I hear slogans even in the message you can see it's a spirit it's an anointing first we speak let me say disrespectful about unbelievers fine okay then we speak disrespectfully about denominations let them give their place then we speak disrespectfully about all those and the message exactly like us then movie at the end we're in a one-man denomination the only one that we respect brother everyone needs a certain form of a respect a dignity rather we don't have television at home but but but there is a certain program I'm not I'm as I'm working I'm still aware of these things there's a program in Germany which says it's some like America's Idol something like this Germany searches the superstar and the the idea of the program is is as follows it is the young people that present themselves and they sing and the the tribunal D those who are judging it they are making fun about these people they have humiliated them rights right before the others that's that's the spirit of it make fun of it now as wrong as the Protestant churches and as far away as it is from God but he was an intelligent man he was writing an open letter to that television station he said we see how these people are humilated online before millions of people he said did you forget that every human being is made in the image of God and there is a dignity that goes along with a person no matter how wrong he is now manages that dignity this goes along with a person can you say Amen I know that I'm now sending is saying now a good sentence and that you say your heart brother Marcus you are our sweetheart but I said at a at a ministers meeting and that was a young brother he was speaking a little bit about retirement and he's as a brother God honors gray hair God honors gray hair that means because it's a lot of life wisdom behind gray hair and God will only bless a young man if he knows how to honor all the people because they proved already in their life that they're standing I mean I know you always say brother Marc you're a sweetheart for us no I know but that that that is exactly so but but what happens when the Prophet came on the scene make the next one please when the Prophet came on the scene that is the life of brother Brennan now I want you to put again the spiritual jacket when you came on earth God never asked you do you want to be American do you want to be white do you want to be black sometimes we have families I personally come from a divorced family something we have families with very difficult backgrounds um and it was not your fault to be born in this situation I mean if your father was an alcoholic you had a heart young at heart use I mean and God placed you there and God knew what he did but we did not choose neither our births but God not knew one thing here is the family of God before I make just a picture before the foundation of the world a man we were we were we are not arrogant because brother brems said if you want to continue with God never have an arrogant spirit in your heart but we are proud of our Father we are proud of who we are Paul said I'm not boasting about the human the GD the outward man but I'm boasting about the man that I saw 40 years ago ago for me that was his own theophany but that's Marcus okay but here's the family of God and God just made a picture and then he took our lives and he was just bring it in seven Church ages some in America some in Australia some there some in Luther's ate some in in Paul say something brother branham saying God knows one thing at the end of all time the whole family of God will began together well the man said God will not lose one of his attributes and he says God is not complete without you can you say Amen and God knows one thing my sheep hear my voice he speaks up among the messenger through the messenger but God some time placed us in difficult situation and he knows it and he places us in bodies that we don't like now you have in America it slogan that we have in Germany the same way a person is standing in his own way and that is most of our problem is not brother stones or sisters also as our speech the weaken is the self in us except brother Graham said that was the curtain behind the between the sanctuary and the holy so it's a South will exactly so the self so God place us with a certain temperament now put on the spiritual jacket we were Pentecostals when we came to the message and we thought when the Holy Ghost comes everything is soft and we did not understand the Baptist of the Holy Ghost is the beginning of all things not the end it's the beginning it's the beginning of my gross amen I mean we thought the Holy Ghost comes and we are completely new creations yes potentially but then now God has to do the word and it takes some time a lifetime till we are molded into that image so here's brother Branham and you have to you have to message on the wings of a snow white dove brother brems said I always was a neurotic but imagine what he says I was a neurotic before my new Birds with the Holy Ghost and after I was old as state to be a neurotic and then he says this I am a melancholic that's what the Prophet said many times I mean that's what the Bible speaks about Elijah was a man of likewise passion brother brems said he was a melancholic type of a person I mean and you still have it even with the Holy Ghost and it's not a problem in this but it it shows some actions that we have I'm how we stay in our own way and brother Graham said this he said you have to know your weaknesses and then you protect your weaknesses by prayer exactly so but we have that nature that we didn't didn't want to have but God places in body so to make it all hell is against you o natural outside is against you and even your own self is against you and the only one who is a true believer is he eaten eternal part that God placed in your soul can you say amen amen therefore look brother man full of the Holy Ghost the seals are open and I'm not going to a step because for Wednesday evening but about let me give you an example no I will not give you because because that I'm taking away by the time but now this is re I become I have a subject to to to really focus in but look look look brother Brian in 1963 me standing in the gap I mean the seals are open did brother man to have the Holy Ghost certainly at the Holy Ghost but he wanted to give up and he said it was because of the people then let me know I was not able enough exactly so and so he stopped the car and God said look to the west he said that's your life exactly so that is your life seven seven seven peaks three poles now I asked you the question when did those mountain came came up do you think that was 96 is free that God said he came up when God created the earth he knew my seventh angels a melancholic type of a person and God says to brother Benny if you ever have a doubt in your mind come back to this can you say Amen so so so when when my god speaks to brother branham you have to have to understand one thing you you came out wrong on this earth though in America you are on the lucky side of life and we in Germany on the lucky side of life you say brother Marcus mr. Trump is right I mean all these Mexicans and all these from Honduras let's make a wall that's right and we say the same thing you know let them drown in the military military and see you see let them stay in Turkey but if God would have placed you in Mexico you would think different you would have a baby of nothing to feed amen we have a brother living in Venezuela and the other day yes there's a brother there's a president by the name of Maduro say so so so so so let me say in my own words idiotic that the people of now anything anything to eat now what do you do then you have to say only believe the same way God places here on the lucky side of life thank you Father thank you Jesus I mean blessed be but God could have placed us God a good God could have placed your soul in a boat in a body which is handicapped and still it's the same God that's the be the name God can place you in a rich family God can place you in a poor family and and you say brother Marcus we had a denominational idea of now when we come to the law we presents everybody you know I brought five to the role and here's all my children and look at what a something you have nobody to present we have brothers in the church where the whole family doesn't come to church anymore I tell the brother I said look brother you will not help those families if you stay alone if you stay man and now at home he said you serve the Lord you would see what God will do I said at least at the white throne judgment you will see them again becomes a sister and in in the denominational world they thought I mean a system us to evangelize and that sister she lost her husband and the other sister asked her look what will you present to Jesus when he comes you did not Nathalie you just raised up the family you did not eventually us here and there knew what that sister said she I will show him my hands how I worked for the family that was that was the thing to honor God something you have to say I don't have no trophy but I am the Prophet Rafi I made it I came through against all odds I never gave up I am the trophy of God can you say Amen let's be the name of the Lord so therefore you have to understand one thing and and and it's it I think the thought is clear from the Bible if you will have a theophany you have it already because the Bible says if our when our earthly tents will be dissolved we have a body which is not made by hand but which is eternal that means that body is eternal and brother MAME said there's always the orphan so God we're not before you die ten minutes before you die think will you get at your phanie digi paste I think what you always nice to Marcus Becker see that was our understanding but but God gave you the victory already before you were born it was already there therefore brother Branham said any bring any any opens that mystery he shows the life of death of that woman at the well how she was frauded or discouraged by by her first husband and she throws away her life and she got from one husband to the next and the Bible said he had to pass by Samaria and brother Brent said because she had a representation of the thoughts of God no matter what it is to my understand it says he often but that's Marcus I might be wrong in this but one thing is sure if she had representation from the thoughts of God that means she did not get a representation because Jesus came by but Jesus came by because she had already a representation brother sister I tell you those who were in the world God took care of already of you when you never thought about him you were already in his mind God you had already an angel protecting you because he elects his angels and you were in the world you are the discotheque you are saying God says I have to pay attention my child makes too much to try to soothe you understand and then we're gonna say how our father cared for us and the same father who cared will bring you home Ramiro and it will be him bringing me home swing low Sweet Chariot coming for to carry me Oh can you say Amen so that's your life God didn't give us a nice life for none of us you say or if I would be in that family every child of God has their challenges some here and some there everybody has because character is molded by by this circumstance but I want to say one thing if you are on the mountaintop don't be arrogance oh if I see that family and the children I don't understand and courses you don't understand I will show you if it's not my hand you're sure and go go go do anything the same thing so if we're on the mountaintop don't become arrogant but if you are in the valley don't give up don't give up because if you're in the valley the next mountain will come because there's a power that brings me home can you say Amen and next one please I'm gone I'm just going through I mean now here what here's what happened now when the Prophet came as I told you I have to read like this sorry for this because when the Prophet came his whole ministry was the healing part right but others could now let me say others could we reproduce what the Prophet did even more healings you see these ministries like like Swami Osbourne he was sitting in brother brems meeting he said what he does I can do the same is they all come out of the minister brother branham and it had tremendous healings but one thing is sure they had no message no message because a father is the head of his home pastors the head of the local church Christ is the head of the men of the age the messengers the head of the age Christ is the head of all seven messengers so the bride is the final voice in the final age under her messenger okay say Amen so loud is here at many tremendous men one of them is Jimmy Swaggart single again sisters but only one had a voice only one had a voice can you say Amen so brother why should I read books of all kind of theologians knowing that they don't have a clue about the truth the word comes to the Prophet can say Amen if you have too much time read all kinds of books but we are pressed in some way we don't have time to to lose we get in the message directly him say Amen so but there is there is a changing and the Prophet explains it because coming to church or coming to these great meetings became an entertainment for the people brother and that is what we see even when we see many of these I'm a camp speaker that's how I'm invited people say brother Marcus the young people's pizza is a use Minister that's fine nothing if it's for that so we go to use camps but sometimes we've seen it became an entertainment for them exactly there's no changing there's no sincerity in that whole thing you see sometime you can even a local church you see I was new in our local church in here comes some youngsters they came in like this in the church I wonder myself who the parents were but Zulu soon I found out who the parents were because they came that is no sanctuary you wonder you're so hey do you speak to your father do you know is here we believe in a church like this the same pillar of fire that was with brother man must be here must be here if not we are just making nice speeches we believe wherever the message of God is preached God is there power of transformation so God says we have now to change the program he said this and and this is called the détente vision okay first full second potent vision I seen them bring a lady on a stretcher and there was a lady there taking her name sings on a paper and there was someone got her pushed her through the next man comes through with his crutches I see them go through that little building and on the outside the lady came out screaming to the top of her voice pushing the stretcher and then there was another lady on the other side looked like kind of a dark head woman and she said what happened she said I just don't know we could continue now now make a stop here the 10th vision this is now Marcus okay the best of my understanding the 10th vision is that brother REM sees that the pillar of fire went from him over little tent or he calls it a wooden building now if you take that vision literally and it must be a tent like they try to do I think in Nicaragua then the question is we poor Germans we will never come to that tent now if the change is in Germany you poor Americans we have to pay a lot of dollars to come to that tent so according to my understanding it has a symbolic meaning and who was the first one who had a tent vision that was Moses going up seeing the scene dddd tabernacle of God and God had told him when you come back to us you build it exactly like you saw in heaven and brother brems said there's a type on a man body soul spirit outer core in a cardboard of horus so for me to change who is the tent where the tent I mean because if our earthly tabernacle our tent will be dissolved we live in a tent let's mark maybe it has other explanations to look down on us don't forget one thing brother system I am a very simple very much you love me but you have to understand I live in a German tent for 70 80 years but if this change will be resolved you would see who Marcos was really can't say Amen so he can have different different explanations about this but for me it's not literate symbolic like brother Brent said the bride is the heavenly New Jerusalem is the New Jerusalem that's the P the name of the Lord so what happens is this people went into this change as a symbol and they came out heel without knowing how it happened that was the vision of brother Brennan I mean I went there and the woman said what's happened she said I just don't know I couldn't tell what happened she said I've been paralyzed I feel I never was sick and so and so on I don't know what happened now you understand that people got healed without knowing how they got healed that means it is not the old system of let's make the prayer line and let's put hands because these people would have known brother so-and-so came and when he laid his hand I was healed they said I just came to church or whatever and I would see I don't know how do you understand that God is not working in a supernatural way without making some kind like a platform demonstration brother if you want to have something from God you don't have to travel to any convention to any discipline you come just and stay on your post of duty and your father's rewards you they say men that's to be I am a churchgoer absolute churchgoer but when church I'm always going but I have to realize that all the manifestation of the third put were outside of a church God shows I'm not only in the church here I go with the wait where you are if you go hunting and your attitude is right I can heal you there you say Amen let's be the name whatever but there might be other identification let's a bit but it went away from the principle of the man of the hour to understand the god of the hour is there they say Amen I mean next one please I mean therefore I mean when that picture was taken the Bible says but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness now you have to understand one thing there brother Branham was a star and a star shines in the night that is loud this year and we are still living in loud this year because mr. Trump is not the owner it is not in the millennium he's not be were still living in loud this year but the bride at the same time came over into bride age Haman and brother Branham preaches the message Shalom 1964 good morning church why does he say good morning the night is over and the Prophet said this he said when when when when the Sun goes up the Sun is the king of all lights say Amen we still live in laude 2nd condition but the bride's went over this the bride is in bride age can you say Amen therefore the bride is not miserable it's somebody miserable here but then you should better come into bride age it's somebody a son somebody blind that would be said it's somebody you're naked when the word came down no sir it's a special time can you say Amen but what goes along when we speak about the opening of the words he said miss healing under his wings there's a healing that God does that was never done before the other pulls but it's different than we thought we always had Pentecostal ideas somebody has to come somebody has to lay hands and God said look my presence will do many things because when the Sun comes up it pulls out all the water what you say ok say Amen so do you today you don't look for the man of the hour who should we invite to revive the church invite the word who should I invite to them get here invite the words and the healing is going there can you say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord there's a changing make the next one please ok right I mean finishing that little part about this now this is just the same picture that we show before but now just let me say when those when those seven angels came in the form of a pyramid in Division the brother brands had in sources of time in that vision he said I was caught into that constellation I mean and he was a movement I mean I mean now first brother branham rides it as a little gap I mean but there is an invisible Union today going on which means a heavily bright group and the earthly bright because this headstone he said is magnetized therefore the head was in that it's Christ the entire Holy Ghost that's the thing that the church was waiting for 2,000 years ago that is you in New York you in Florida this day this scripture is fulfilled what revelation one to seven set the prophet what Christ came down they say amen amen with what healing under his wings so somebody came down well REM says Christ I mean and somebody's taken up I mean so if if if the church is standing here somewhere and that cloud comes and takes the church in its constellation you don't see them anymore and you remember that brother brand said in the fourth chapter of Revelation the church is not be seen anymore they say Amen so we think the church is raptured taking away yes but there is a spiritual application to I just have to find just give me a second brother update brother wait do you know do you know a mrs. Christian parent girl well do you know mrs. Christian pairing God brother Joe Canada do you do you know mrs. Christian parent girl so the FBI is here give that woman out pairing uh Christine Harrigan if not we take you to the sheriff will arrest you you say honestly brother friends is there's no Christine but do you know it Christine Oh Diego by marriage she changed her her identification Christine Paran God doesn't exist anymore but the person is still there she's there and not there you see she's there and not there when I was a young boy I made all the nonsense that you can do in the world I was in the French Foreign Legion I mean those still soldiers you know how the French Foreign Legion works you go in as a criminal I wasn't a criminal but I went in I was a sinner but not a criminal but I went in and when you come to the French Foreign Legion you just get a number and when you come out of five years you get a complete new passport I mean you were never born I was born in Germany your old passport does not exist but you are born you get a passport this is Mark not Marcus Becker but Marcus Marcus so Levon born in Paris you get a complete new identity so I'm there the police comes is here Marcus Becker listen is no Marcus Pakistani but I changed my identity the church cannot be seen anymore why how do you make it but changing your name how do you change the name by marriage the invisible union of priceless work amen yes therefore brother Graham said one thing is sure and that's the thing therefore he came down to reveal our true identity therefore we're not Baptist anymore therefore we're not saying I'm I am in the message that's fine but that's not our identity no but we're in Christ look here is that that Rahab and when those two brother Brahim said they were tube che boys when they're coming in she made a covenant first brother and said she protected the message and the message later saved the household of her afraid 40 is there alien spies it was what afar Israel army it was not difficult to find out who the house of rape because it was at the outside wall and when all the walls crumbled one house was still standing and said that's rehab that was not difficult to find but there is a mystery behind that story says brother Branham because Ray had married Solomon the great American general Israeli general and both went to Bethlehem to to build objets city Bethlehem now from the moment on that salman married Rahab she was not Rahab anymore she was miss salmon and when she entered tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu Bethlem and somebody would have asked where is the horror 1/2 who standing right before them and not she's changed her identity I'm not oh I'm I'm miss Simon do you understand the church is not be seen anymore it has a double meaning blessed be the name of the Lord therefore he came down therefore he's our identity therefore we have two names I mean therefore we are Esther therefore Esther had two names one was the Israeli name that ester star and one was her original name that means Hadassah which means bride or merchant therefore we have we have an let me say we have a human life I I ask you who are you he said I'm Fritz Miller born in Connecticut and then he said but I'm more than this I was there when joke comin when they all shouted for joy I was already in the mind of wrong you understand that our begin was not in America it was long before the foundation of the world and all those who were him they will come back we are just in a little Passat we're just building for some years and God came down and opened and revealed our identity who we are for us the rapture is the most normal thing like going to church because you are the rapture is not the rapture hey my father paid for me at the cross at Calvary and my father takes me home and he came to unite himself with me in spirit form in Word form and I go forward can you say Amen there is a day like there's never been a day like this day before now let me just read and we're stopping this first okay sorry for this but I need this it I need can you say Amen so far now I showed you why God has to come down because we can do our efforts as good as we can but we come to our end and whenever children of God came to the end God came down personally that's his nature that's the way how we understand the Bible the Bible became through the opening of the cell a new book now we understand how our Father is who he is and how he thinks now God came down to become men God never sits on his throne and said okay you do know your business we will see who makes the rapture God comes down I love that little illustration a little boy goes into a shop and he wants to buy some dogs and the owner comes down the staircase he said and the boy said I want to have this dog and the owner says why do you want to have this dog I mean he's handicapped he cannot walk he doesn't have a value why don't you take a real good one and the boy is rolling up his his his trousers and from his knee on he has an artificial leg and the boy said I want to have this dog because when we go out he understands me and I understand him and brother BAM said this God became man to understand man and then brother brems says and that is our Father God became teenager to understand the teenager and then he even says this God became man as man you understand the mixed audience okay God became man to understand man because when David felt was that woman God must have said David I mean how can you fought with that don't you know what I gave to you but when God became man he knew what hormones are there for a woman comes to brother Brahim said and she's so torn up my brother and said everything is with you wrong and everything is right you are just in your menopause not more we still live in that body and God understands that God became teenager to understand the teenagers God came personally down every evening in the Garden of Eden that's our father brother our father had a lot of things to do a lot of because I mean all these theophany policy all these seraphim's all these Shara beams to take care of it's quite something and then to put in action all these all these universe every star I mean that's something to do but every evening God came down because his children weren't Eden and brother if we understand how God was we take care of our children you can have your hobby you can have your fishing whatever but never put family second first God and then you choose the family can't say Amen don't put him just before the screen and said okay let him entertain themselves they don't need a screen any deli and then in mama to take care of them to pray with them God was an example for us God came down every evening God came down personally to destroy the Tower of Babel God came down personally to shut the door in Noah's Ark so I came down in a shut the door God came down personally to protect the wife of Abraham when Abraham was lying to to the Pharaoh and brother and said he put already on his pajama he would think about this nice little girl and God said look I have to protect and he comes down a speaks to me said look my friend you're a good as a dead man I mean you can imagine his feelings change a little bit he he he can't a little bit down from his feelings that Pharaoh brother BAM said this God had to protect her because she was the wife of a prophet that's to be the name of the Lord God came personally down to visit Abraham and gave him his personal promise I mean God came down personally to wrestle with Jacob and gave him his new identity I mean you're not Jacob you're living in America born in Connecticut you're this honest I know you that's that's your size of shoes that's your blood market I always weld it's your profession that's your inside or IQ Oliver that's you but I'll give you another name your Israel I'm a fighter for God aruhya God came briskly down to meet Moses and gave him his commission he says I came down and I sent you brother BAM said this whenever it's important for God he comes personally that's our Father that's all he doesn't send someone there for brother Branham says this and he speaks about God you have to understand this he said he was the fire brigade of Jeffersonville and and and and there was a some kind like a fire and the fire captain let me call him captain he was standing outside you go there and you go there under and the fire was just going on and then they're hurting ding ding ding ding ding ding and here comes the fire brigade for Louisville and the captain was standing on the ladder and the ladder goes into the fire and the man said man behind me come behind me and brother brems in five minutes everything was finished because he was somebody taking initiative God's came personally down to open the Red Sea look Israel did their part but when they were standing at the Red Sea they knew one thing we can dance we can shout we can praise we can exorcise us into some emotionalism but at the end of the day when God doesn't come down and makes the miracle we're standing here and God says why are you crying big man and brother mem said the angels were just around Moses just waiting for him to speak that's our Father Casey amen God came personally down to meet Joshua God came personally down to Gideon and gave him his commission I mean gives you under Howard I mean he was as a coward and God says Gideon mighty man who makes the rapture if you would see God says mighty man who makes the rapture God says look I mean rising of the Sun quickening power brought me behind the curtain of time and I saw all of you there and he says all of them there and about first he's all of you there God sees the bride in the rapture already God says I've called you bro but you know if I if you would know how I feel God's I'm not used to how you feel I see you're ready because you have a representation will I make it God says hey I know you make it because you're my child hey man do you understand that we rest on God raptures that we have to work as into something into no no no my father will pick me up my father will not forget me here can you say Amen God came personally down to wake up Samuel God came personally to David to direct a stone I mean and I make it just as a little now he was David with his effort do whatever you can to serve the Lord do your part but no it will not be enough I mean no that is not enough and then here comes a stone he comes David yeah and brother brems said this when the stone left the hand of David God took that stone in his hands and on that stone was an address front of David of Goliath so Goliath could have made this or this or that stone would have said look I have a destiny friends wherever you hide I find you they say men if you do your part brother brain said God will send the same angel suit that he sent to Elijah that's our Father he's not sitting just and said we will see who will make it that's not our Father you do your part your father okay I help you can you say Amen what a wonderful father we have God came down personally to his rearing prophet Elijah God came personally that down to identify job job dead dead dead poor man and here come here come the fourth man after three friends I mean the first one was a Lutheran the second one was a Methodist the third one was a Pentecostal make sure what you did is a prayer line man and some gifts man that's fine we love these things but they are not the answer to our question job you need it you know it has to shiver that we have these things enough that's fine but that's not our answer right I'm a we need more we need identity from God and here comes early who and he speaks about job look you have only 78 years to live and when you die there is already a body waiting because you will get your used again and job stands up and says I know that my Redeemer liveth and right from the whirlwind says job stop being a Pentecostal baby because I want to speak supernatural to you stop being kindergarten stand before me like a man because God will not marry a child God will not marry a baby God will marry a woman exactly so Christ will marry a true bride and God says man stand up here's joke and he asked him just a question job I want to ask you ask you one thing where were you and job must have said Oh God I was just thinking about that little life in here in Georgia and I was seeing a little problems in this and Jason and problems with my I kind of paid the bill that kind of this and God said to him my job where were you and job must have but I was in you can you say Amen do you know one thing if we speak about spiritual amnesia you can only have amnesia when you had knowledge before if not you have nada Misha you have had the knowledge who you were before but amnesia put it out and here comes God though I said I would take that amnesia from you I mean therefore we believe the third Pole because in the mind of God we were with him when he was creating we saw him doing the things therefore it's not a problem for us created creating squirrels for God is nothing you see man do you know one thing how it's so important to understand the voice in the voice they find out that the last sense that we have is the hearing when when a person dies and when a person's in coma and the person likes a special singer and you put the music of that singer on that person because sometimes comes back to life because that voice Michael Jackson would have pulled him up so so I told the church one thing is sure if I will fall into a coma you know what you put on my ears okay and if I hear good evening friends [Applause] now this room essage remembers us about things that we knew before but we wouldn't we forgot them because we're still in that body therefore when we preach we don't preach here we preach here can you say Amen blessed be and the more God is involved and folding himself the more we remember our self therefore for us the rapture is just I mean I wasn't him that is a logical thing that I would go interruption not in that thing of okay let's drink and that smoke that is not a son of God but if you do your best from that point and God takes you up can you say Amen God comes personally in the fiery furnace of Babylon God comes firstly to me to have to marry for her pregnant God comes down in the form of men and in Christ Jesus God comes personally to Paul on the way to Damascus God comes personally to open the prison of Paul and Barnabas God comes first into brother Brian give him his commission God comes personally to the Ohio River God comes personally to Houston Texas to make a picture and we say oh that's brother branham was the pillar of fire brother brems said God wanted to make a picture of himself and he allowed that I was on the picture too so for us it's more difficult to be an unbeliever than to be a believer I mean for us not to believe that because we have even the photos can you say Amen God came personally on Sunset Mountain that the bridegroom will meet his bride Christ the word God comes down to take his bride I mean and God comes personally to Israel to reveal himself I mean can you say Amen now brother Brian makes the scenery and he says it like this whenever deal it deals with God's children God is not sending someone it's too important from it's his children I mean therefore he did not send body else at the cross and say okay you die for because it was his children I die for my children and the Prophet said this now when when when when and I could read it but but just let me say it in my word he said when the three youngsters were in that fiery furnace and baby lon he's in Babylon he said the angels came and said let me go down and one of the angel I will wash everything away and then God says no one word you was you was a mighty angel that's just wonderful but he said I saw this youngster spraying last night and I heard the cry and then both of em said this what God says he said this is a man-sized job and then God says I have to go down myself who was the first one was it Dan no that was Christ can you see him whenever it's important for God he comes personally so I showed you through all the scripture what happens in our day God is not just sitting here said okay mmm here in Georgia we would see who it makes it God knows already say okay I'll help you okay you do your Papa to help you there's a certain moment where I take you just under my arms okay I send you a fair chariot of fire okay um do we believe that I mean just just mix it Nate I come to the end I mean therefore I told you next one that's one last one yeah therefore I told you I hope that everything that I said look you understand that it was a little bit pressed if all the balance was a little bit out you understand it was I was speaking about a subject okay but let's be a Thanksgiving to remember our Father you say hey if I had ten thousand lives I would serve the Lord brother Marcus what is your doctrine as for me and by heart we serve the rose it's a love affair now this is this is a picture very very touchy this man is not the grandfather this man is the father of that girl it's an unbeliever but the man has cancer that means he has not long to live and he knows one thing nobody in the life of my daughter will replace daddy do you know as a mother as a father nobody takes your place do you know that God placed our children willfully in our family if you are failing just nobody would take take your place I mean so we should be prayed up Lord let me be the best father best mama in the world absolutely so I mean this man understood a lesson that we have to understand some time this was her father having cancer having very short to live and he knows one thing I will never be able to bring my daughter to the altar when she buries so what they were doing as she is maybe 12 years old she had no husband that's for sure but they were doing as if there is a marriage and he was just taking that girl to the altar and when she will marry one day they will continue that ceremony from that moment on and she will be able to say my own father brought me to the altar if a natural father can be like this what about our Father what about our if we would know how he thinks about us and how he cares brother Brahim says it like this he said when when his great meetings 1st 2nd poof and they were over the young that these these disciples were just on a boat testimony on the sea they were just they became dark and brother brems and the bible says jesus went up on a mountain and brother bam said he was observing them all the time and when the night was there in the midst of laude seer he came down personally what a time that we live our time exact he came down personally a man who who wants to go back to a former age it's no way no way no there has never been a day like this day before God always comes in our direction therefore brother bream said when Abram came from the slaughter Melchizedek came to him one came from there McKenzie came from the coming when Rebecca was on the camels coming to Isaac Isaac came halfway to Rebekah to meet her in the evening time when the prodigal son came back to the Father the Bible says the father was running to him he was not saying mom that's not our Father you know when you come to church at your father's waiting for you do we come just to church we have a religious service and to say it was nice wasn't it you I'm a believer I have an eagle here at Eagle here and eager tattooin or do we come say the house of the Lord whatever whatever whatever I did whatever the problems I can talk to my father I have a little daughter 16 years old you see do you mean that when I come home that I want my daughter underneath and say Oh father is coming father is coming he goes to work so that I can go to McDonald saying you father hey we are not Islamic type of people God is not searching that all the angels can glory to the all the angels can sing like this but I want my daughter just to grab me hey daddy do you have time you have time for you I was touched five years ago when when I saw that that little remark of your grandson the greatest treasure my grandma and it was touched again you know my my I saved my own words my grandfather teach me basketball my father grandpa teach me how to shoot my father teach medias what does the boy right my grandfather took his time for me he invested time for me I was so precious for my grandfather that he took his precious time and dealed with me you see we as father and mothers do we show our children hang your precious to me you're important to me I mean sometimes we come home with directly it's Internet River instead of saying hey my time is your time can you understand what I want to say and we have a father who wants to let us know hey my time is your time I mean you want to pray I'm there how much time that God was the pillar of fire we'll be in our sleeping place and we said and we asked where is God and nothing happens nothing happens brother there is right now the greatest revival ever going on because the Prophet said the revival is over the Pentecostal revivals over they live on the ashes of that even the message that if on the ashes of it but the bride didn't have a revival yet it's a complete different form of a revival it's different what a time if you miss this that still small voice you miss the message you just have God send a prophet that's not enough recognizing the day and smash is more than to understand God sent the Prophet many people saw God send the prophet but he is here therefore God's wish to brother Graham in the in that vision he said why don't you walk with me and said that would be the greatest privilege God asked you why do you walk Oh for me is enough go to church and then you lived my life you know you know you know I'm a hockey fan that's all fine but God ask you why don't you walk with me you say man how how how the bride the rapture is already going on not the body change sure no but we do you feel how we how we how we get away from the things of the world do we feel it we are already in college raptured condition that's how about the brand called but is already something that God that that we're leaving the things more slowly by slowly I mean and that we are transformed already in that we are thinking more about heavenly things than about earthly things he meant it's already going on that thing that'll be the name of the Lord hardly if the musicians would come hallelujah I mean do you have the song I have a father I have a father do you know her yeah III have he knows money but if you can you can you play it now if you don't have it and let us sing let's do it like this do you play softly the song that you were playing as the last song when I when I came up yeah open the eyes of Marr just softly in our because I have two little testimonies to give and then and then a very small but very sure don't don't fear can you say Amen so far do you really see Stacey that let have that just have a have a little time to think about our Father you see that these little stories there brother Brandon tells there were not to be just a little bit emotional but the whole message even this little stories they they should show the heart of God God says hey children that's the way I am do you understand Martin Luther they were always they brought a picture of God always fighting after fight was this enough to fight with that and you know but God says hey I'm a father I understand and here's that older man and brother man said in the message God gifts find always their places and the father had that dog and it seems that the little girl died already but he promised her that dog for Christmas you see and he just went into the into the dark and the policeman said you are going to die if you continue that way and the father said about a promise to my girl to give her that dog no matter the price that it will cost for God no matter the price God remembers he's a father don't forget your children who are not serving the Lord right now you say brother Marcos these children they bring reproach on the family look my life brought a lot of reproach on God's family but my father was never ashamed of me because he paid the price on Calvary right before I was born my father always said to all the Angels look this is Marcos he brings a lot of reproach but once I call him you will see what it will be I mean and there is a true story that's really end to understand what human love can do and now you bring it multiplied with a thousand there was an earthquake in Armenia at the beginning of this century wisdom a true story a true witness Anna Anna Anna school collapsed and the Red Cross they stopped to search because there was no hope to find the children but one father was starting to shovel with this with his hands for 16 or 18 hours and some helped him because they thought this father has become crazy and after 16 and 17 hours they came into a place of protection right under the building where these youngsters were still in and the testimony of those who survived was that the boy of that father who was beginning to shovel had he had a testimony he said my father will not let me hear me he said whatever that will cost him my father takes me out and I tell you there was a supernatural connection between these between the confession of that boy and the father and without knowing what he does he was just starting that's our Father and brother I tell you one thing sister this world becomes crazy but our father says I will not let you here our Father comes down because in all history when it became difficult for sure he said I come down personally so the rapture is not that God says okay we will we will we would see our father said look you do your part but when your wisdom is said when you are at the end of everything know one thing I pick you up there I have a father you have a father that's our doctrine for today that's our Thanksgiving said Lord [Music] can you say Amen you just sing the song again

want to see [Music] go home with her thoughts in her mind about our Father because he is our Father not to this to be the father of a human flesh no he's a father of a kingdom of kings and priests diseases like I've always said about David you think about David could go out there and just kill a giant and burner and the line what if he'd had the baptism of the Holy Ghost he took the line the bar and the giant and put them all together tied one hand behind him and said come on we're gonna solve this right now why because it would've been so great and that's what the kingdom of God is a born-again believer we truly have a great father man amen tell her brother how much you appreciate him appreciate him coming by visiting with us and having a good time with us and if you have anything you'd like to give to him we take care of the offers and all but if you have anything you'd like to give to employed for really did give it to Nolan and all I said he wouldn't ask for nothing because he tried her best to give me the money back because he says he worked for a living I like that you know what I like that I never did get to know my father he died when I was about four years over but I don't know whether he was lazy or not but I just don't think being a Christian makes it right for us to be lazy I think it puts us to where we ought to be on fire for him and going for him all the time having a good time in the Lord amen I thought all mines clear just remember pray for the services for the weekend and pray that the Lord would bless got each and every one of us father we thank you for the night thank you that you'd come by one more time and you talked to us Lord we thank you we ask you now that just bless that's our brother desire comes truly here if we have the same father

the way home give everybody a safe journey and let your loving grace be with us remember the sick ones among us because you promised it you said you'd send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction and we thank you forgive our sins is the main thing father and just go home with each and every one of us and let your light be there guide us down keep us in Jesus name [Music]
