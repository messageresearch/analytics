========================================

surgery so just keep that in prayer let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around this morning and be able to study your word while Lord I pray Lord that you just set our mind in order to receive the things that you've got in store for us today Lord Open the Eyes of our heart Lord we pray Grant it Lord that you just be with us in your name now we're studying out in in Hebrews chapter 13 where where uh we got to the scripture where Paul's talking about remember them they have the rule over you and and really what what I'm kind of moving toward is just kind of a little brief study on um nickan ISM because we um we want to make sure we we keep that balance where it it's it's it it you know it's it's hard to keep a balance sometimes when you're studying out scripture you can go one way and you're in the gutter on that side one way you're in the gutter on that side so we want to be we want to be uh to have the Lord rule over us not a man's ideas or things so that's where you come into the nickan the nickan uh spirit and what that is now brother Brown said in the resume of the church ages or resume in the church age book he said the nickan doctrine was the corruption of the clergy as they sought political power amongst themselves and then you you follow that uh it kind of grows it's the same it's the devil moving nickan ISM balam ISM Jezebel moving through those different stages but starts out as just a little uh a will say in nician Doctrine was the corruption of the clergy as they saw political power amongst themselves while bism is the subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold them and further on down in that quote he says nanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby deposing the spirit now I got the you know a lot of times when we talk about nanism we immediately start thinking about the illustration of of the Catholic church and you know how the example brother Brandon would give of the um you know saying that the Eucharist is the literal Body of Christ we know that's wrong you think about really what the essence of nianis is nanism is swapping the liberty of the Holy Ghost swapping the Holy Ghost the leadership of the Holy Ghost in your life and the life of the church swapping that for what a man says swapping those two things instead of allowing the Holy Ghost Liberty in your life by the correct understanding of the word and all those things instead you're looking at what a man says so the the um the example here we've got of a man saying well uh the priest is going to drink the wine that congregation can't do it it all it represents that that Eucharist represents the literal body and blood of Christ and all those things are wrong so instead of looking at what the re true revelation of the word is you're looking at what a man says which takes away and remember what brother I I really enjoyed Tuesday night what brother Chris long was bringing out is that if your mind is is is is been transformed by the word so that it's in the right Avenue in the right channel then the Holy Ghost can have Liberty so if you've got the right teaching and the right understanding and you're looking at it right if you're looking if You' got the right uh if your mind is in the right gear then the spirit can have Liberty so you see why the doctrine matters the doctr M because the doct if the right Doctrine is going to it's going to give the Holy Ghost Liberty in the church so you can see where brother randam as he's bringing out what nickan ism is it's really about uh giving the Holy Ghost the ability to do what the Holy Ghost wants to do in the church now really really nianis is um is is it it starts off that Antichrist Spirit which is an anointed one and uh but you know you can um nail it down like that but all these little attributes of what nickan ism is when you study it out you know you begin to realize I want to stay as far away with any of that as I can I want to stay as far away from anything that would restrict the ability of the Holy Ghost to do what he wants to do in my life in the church in the people so look look at this last little statement that brother Ram said nanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church what does that mean I I like to just kind of meditate on these things what does that mean humanizing the leadership of the church now if you kind of break that down that means humanizing the leadership refers to a shift in focus and these are just my notes really just uh from within the church from Divine or spiritual guidance so in other words it's swapping again swapping the leadership of the Holy Ghost to what some man says to a more human- centered approach in leadership and decision- making it's prioritizing human authority over Divine Guidance the church begins to Value the decisions and authority of human leaders like clergy or church officials over the spiritual and divine guidance traditionally sought through prayer and meditation on scripture or the guidance of the holy spirit it's organizing organizational Focus over spiritual humanizing the leadership leads to an emphasis on organizational structure Ure bureaucracy and governance potentially at the expense of spiritual values and practices starts functioning more like a Human Institution focused on management rules and hierarchy rather than a spiritual entity Guided by religious principles now now really to sum all this up it's we want the Holy Ghost to have Liberty in the church that's that's what it is personal power and politics church leaders might start to operate more like secular leaders seeking personal power engaging in political maneuvering or prioritizing their own agendas rather than serving as humble stewards of the church or just loss of of just being real having a real authentic spiritual experience where God is moving in your life and you're praying praying and meditating and reading your Bible and trusting in God to leave you to to lead you a decrease in the emphasis on personal faith prayer and spiritual growth as a focus turns to maintaining the institutional and human aspects of the church so what what is brother brandham talking about here when he says humanizing the leadership of the church it's it's just when you when you start shift swapping that where a man it's man's ideas instead of the Holy Ghost leading so now let's go back to what Paul's talking about in Hebrews 13 let Brotherly Love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some of entertained angels unawares remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity is is being yourselves also in the body marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me see how Paul's the words that he's saying are molding our mind to just trust in God trust in the leadership of the Holy H ghost trust that God is going to lead us in the path that we should go right and verse seven remember them which have the rule over you now now let's position our minds not like a nickan idea where where it's it's not it's the whole if Paul said we'll get to in a moment follow me as also follow I follow Christ Christ is the one that we're following if we can just stay with the word stay with what God Said remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word word of God there's the thing whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation considering the summation of their life and the conclusion of what it means for them to have followed Christ that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and what we'll get to in a moment is if if God was if God was with brother brandom if God was with brother Dale then he's still the same God and he can still do the same today for you that he did for them so that remember them that remember them which have the rule over you them that led you to that kind of Fate now now here's what brother Ram said about this we just kind of reminder what we kind of studied out last time he said it is the word that rules us not men cuz if it's men then you then you're going to go off into believing that the Eucharist is the literal body and blood of Christ you're going to go off and believing that hell is eternal and you got all these things that what does it end up doing is it is it it it prevents the holy ghost from being able to move in your life because it's false Doctrine and if your mind is not in alignment with the with the word with the true understanding the Holy Ghost won't be able to move right so what's that nickan Spirit doing it's preventing it's it's constricting the liberty of the Holy Ghost to move it's the word that rules us not men now a man as a husband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word now if you really just sit on that for a moment and think about that that will give you the true understanding of how God rules the church any man knows that if his wife maybe does something that he doesn't agree with and you sit down I'll tell you I'm going tell you and you start trying to straighten her up like that you could you you'll find out real quick you need to approach things in a different way God approaches the He he'll straighten up the church with love it it's love a a correction by love not just telling somebody you putting your fist in your you you any man put his fist in his wife's face and say I'll tell you you going to line up or else that's not that's not the right spirit so that's the kind of rulership that's that's not the kind of rulership that God does with his church he he rules with with a a staff of love where he's trying to he's he's trying to he's trying to line us up with by pulling us not pushing there's three pulls not three pushes amen the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress and so if we look at the translation a lot of different translations of what that scripture means like we did last last week remember your leaders who spoke the word of God to you consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith and the ESV remember your leaders those who spoke to you the word of God consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith in the NLT think of all the good that has come from their lives and follow the example of their faith now think about let's position our mind this morning think about all those that great cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 11 and not just those but the great cloud of witnesses that you've seen in your life all the good preachers in the message all the ones down through history that you looked at think of the outcome in their life and think about Hebrews 13 if God was with them what about you if God was with them he'll be with you too if you can have that kind of faith that they did that they demonstrated in their life amen remember those who led you the nasb who spoke the word of God to you and considering the result of their way of life imitate their faith doesn't it doesn't it stir up Faith within you when you see a real Godly Christian somebody that's real stand Standing true in the face of adversity somebody like maybe like Ry Spencer that's got cancer but yet he takes all his pills in the morning and then he gets up behind the pullit and just preaches anyway and just don't care what the devil's do and he's going to do it anyway and that you look at somebody like that and you think well if he can do that what about me in my situation that's what this scripture is speaking of the whole everything that Paul preached is a message of encouragement to encourage the believer remember the way the outcome of these people's life so if you look at what conversation means to definition in the Greek Lexicon manner of Life conduct Behavior to look at all these great examples we have and it builds up our faith brother Brown said in the works that I do bear witness of me he said and now I want to speak just a moment or just bring your attention to a few words here that Jesus said the works I do bear witness of me the things that I do what I say is what Bears record of me and that's what Bears record of every person do you know I'd rather you live me a sermon then preach me one it'll be a better evidence that you're a Christian isn't that right a live a sermon and what we are is what we live what we do our actions shows what we are so that's what Paul is talking about look at not just the words that came out of a preacher's mouth but look at the life the example that they portrayed for you and one of the greatest examples of that in the Bible to really get the essence of what this is is is that little story of David all of Israel was standing there watching as a little Shepherd boy that didn't amount to nothing said I can take on Goliath and when they saw him cut off that Giant's head it built up their faith they said if he can do it then we can too now that's real true leadership is not coming up and saying I don't like Saul sitting back in his tent I don't know if we can overcome but David said we can do it because God if God is with us then there's no devil that can stand against us so what are we doing in Hebrew 13:7 remember the essence of the scripture is remember and consider the outcome remember and consider the outcome of all these examples that have gone on before us and you look down Through the Ages I've got just some little books of all these great authors Augustine and Bon Huffer and Calvin and Luther you think of all the all the church age Messengers all the things that brother R talked about how that the like Martin St Martin how that his the word that he preached gave Liberty to the Holy Ghost to be able to do great signs and wonders in his life and the people in that age and in every age of John Wesley and each each age they could look at that as an example and it would build up their faith and encourage them to know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh look at look at that great example that we've had that the pillar of fire was with brother brandom and you could I I I I like to you know you you sit and just listen and meditate on how brother bram's relationship was with his wife hope and how the conversation that he had with her on his deathbed and the way that he had faith and all those different situations and it you look at the outcome of their life and the way the manner of his conduct and it builds up your faith to say well if God was with him in those situations what about me if the pillar of fire was with him and and God we've got a promise that he where the word is God is that we know that that same Pillar of Fire is still with the bride is still moving with the word and that's what Hebrews 13:8 is about that that same God that was with brother brandham is still the same God today so Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11 he said be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ now that's what a lot of people that hear about we follow a prophet and things they get kind of all it's hard for them to understand that you can follow when when the word is being preached if it's according to scripture and it's by Revelation and it's like Shining Light on the on what the Bible says that you're not following a man you're following Christ we're following Christ and and we know that we're following Christ because Hebrews 138 is evident in that you follow Christ and and it will show Christ will show himself alive in your life he'll show himself he'll vindicate himself by signs and wonders following things some Supernatural things happening in your life to change your life and to to bring the scripture to pass in your life be you followers of me as also I am of Christ and that's what a real leader is because you know brother R said and what went you out to see he said John preached the baptism of the Holy Spirit Spirit he never preached something that he didn't have he preached what he had received and Men of God that sent into the fields today has no right to preach the gospel without the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the first qualification of a minister is to be filled with the Holy Ghost and I got the little illustration here first before you preach it's like somebody in an airplane that's crashing put the oxygen MTH mask on yourself and then you'll be equipped to help somebody sitting next to so you have no right to preach the gospel until you're equipped for people to follow your example how are you going to instruct somebody to overcome if you yourself haven't overcome to begin with be you followers of me also I am as I am of Christ so remember them that have the rule over you in 2 Timothy 4:12 Tim Paul's telling Timothy Lo let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit and faith and Purity a a a Christian preacher is supposed to be an example uh you think about how the church God set up church so that when we come to church we're looking at one another's lives and we're actually modeling Christianity you look at the older the young ones look at the older ones and they'll oh well that's that's how that's what I want to be that's how it's supposed to be you look at the older ones you I want that kind of Purity and Holiness in my life you maybe maybe you hear your mom or your dad praying in the night and that stir something up in a young person I want that kind of a close relationship with God and we're modeling Christianity to one another so that's why a preacher a preacher got to be the it's the highest requirement of all in the church because the whole church is looking at you to model Christianity and a holy life and and a positive outlook for the whole church be thou an example of the Believers in Philippians he said those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do do it and the God of Peace shall be with you in Matthew 5:116 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven let everybody see Christ reflected in your life and in Titus he said and all things showing thyself a pattern of Good Works what does that mean like a p a pattern where somebody can look at your life and say well that's that's the kind of P that's what I want to be we look at Hatty right and say I want to have that same kind of confession be what be it unto me according to Thy word like like looking at Mary whatever you say it's that's nothing but the truth and Doctrine showing un corruptness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you now that's seems like a tall order to live a kind of close one life Oneness life with Christ where nobody can say any evil thing about you but it's possible in First Peter feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint not by force but willingly not for filthy lucer but of a ready mind neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being in examples to the flock being examples examples that somebody can look at you and say that's what a real Christian is that's what I that that that's what I want to be even look at what Proverbs says train up a child in the way that he should go let him let him see observe how how others are and then when he gets old he he's going to stick with that that same path that he's been set on now you really think about what that means train up a child when he sees when he's sees Mom and Daddy praying in the in the house he's sat on that course when you instruct him how to how to read his Bible and he's young or or her when they get older they're going to be set on that course and then when they get older you can look back on that promise and claim it how how can you claim that though if you don't train them up in the way that they should go that's that's where we kind of get off kilter sometimes we don't train them up and then when we get when they get older we look back well I'm I'm going to try to claim that scripture but you can't claim it if you didn't train them up in the way they should go to begin with and when he is old he will not depart from it beloved follow because we're all following something follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of God but he that doeth evil hath not seen God so remember them that have the rule over you not like a nickan right in Ezekiel chapter 34 son of man prophesy against the Shepherds of Israel prophesy and say unto them thus sayith the Lord God unto the Shepherds woe be to the Shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves should not the Shepherds feed the flocks you eat the fat and you clothe you with the wool you kill them that are fed but you feed not the flock the diseased have you not strengthened neither have you healed that which was sick neither have you bound up that which was broken neither have you brought again that which was driven away neither have you sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have you ruined them oh that's what the gospel is when it's really preached in power and demonstration of the spirit it's a positive gospel it help somebody that's diseased help somebody that's Afflicted help somebody that's lost their way to pull them back to the truth and he said and they were scattered because there is no Shepherd and they became meat to all the Beast of the field when they were scattered in Matthew Jesus said but Jesus called unto them and said ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise de dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them now remember what we're talking about remember them to have the rule over you we we want to get our minds aligned to what this is really representing not to have dominion over one another not to you know have our thumb on one another but to be examples to to rule with with with with that kind of Christian love where a a good godly man will will try to rule over his house and his wife but it shall not be so among you to have exercise dominion and authority and those kind of things it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many and in 1 Peter 5:3 neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being an example to the flock examples to lead to not to drive but to pull in uh in the Greek Lexicon that scripture says it the the the meaning of that word is to to lead to go before to be a leader to rule command to have authority over a prince leading as respects influence controlling and counsel overseers or leaders of the church to used of any kind of a leader so what's the scripture saying remember your leaders and the consequen of their faith in God and we're closing here in just a moment we go back to that scripture that quote that brother Ram said it is the word that rules us yes not men that's right now A man is a husband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their their conversation which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and brother Brown would say that means he would act the same he would act the same as he did with those in the lives of those men that we're looking at if that is the same Spirit here as it was then it'll manifest the word like it did then there's no difference in him at all as a musician can go ahead and come forward there's no difference in him at all he lives in his church doing the same thing and he said if that is the same holy spirit that was in the wilderness with Israel and also was in Jesus Christ it's now in the church it does the same works because it's the same light it's the same Spirit if you could just believe that friend God bless you Saints we end on that [Applause] amen [Applause] [Music] okay oh
