[0:03] all right we're still having issues with
[0:06] the computer so just do the video this
[0:09] morning I don't have any slides so we'll
[0:13] just discuss you can see you yeah I can
[0:16] see myself
[0:19] she's kind of scary
[0:25] we're on Matthew chapter five
[0:39] Matthew chapter 5 of Beatitudes
[0:44] the last time we were talking about the
[0:46] pure and heart shall see God
[0:48] and I put the Zodiac in there
[0:52] not really it wasn't really a lesson on
[0:54] the Zodiac it was a lesson on seeing God
[0:56] when God opens things to you then you
[0:59] can see him and maybe unexpected places
[1:02] when he comes into your in your life in
[1:05] your heart and like that Deacon and
[1:07] brother downstairs you can see him
[1:09] uh in your life and nature and just
[1:12] everywhere you look you can see them in
[1:14] places where other people can
[1:18] you know many times you might be in
[1:20] church and uh the holy spirit will just
[1:22] drop down right on you and open up
[1:24] something to you that the person right
[1:25] next to you might not see in the way
[1:28] that you see it right because
[1:30] um God is opening up and in that way you
[1:33] in that moment you God opened something
[1:36] up to you that
[1:38] um makes it personal to you
[1:41] and then uh
[1:44] we're going through the Beatitudes
[1:46] blessing of the poor in spirit blessed
[1:47] are they they're more and blessed are
[1:49] the meat blessed are they which hunger
[1:51] and thirsty for righteousness for they
[1:52] shall be filled and now you're filled
[1:54] with the Holy Ghost and you become
[1:57] merciful you can show Mercy you're pure
[1:59] in heart and now we're on first nine
[2:02] ballistic are the peacemakers for they
[2:04] shall be called the children of God
[2:07] and peacemakers because God gives you
[2:10] peace
[2:12] and God give you uh you know think about
[2:16] during the creation
[2:18] um
[2:18] and just all of the stories in the Old
[2:21] Testament all the way up to uh this this
[2:24] time when Jesus was made manifest to the
[2:27] world he came to the Earth in a little
[2:29] manger and at that time
[2:32] all down through history as usual
[2:34] looking back at their history at the
[2:36] writings of Joshua and all of their the
[2:39] Old Testament history of how they Ward
[2:40] with the Gentiles and there was no peace
[2:43] in the Earth and and uh
[2:46] then the Shepherds were in the field and
[2:49] an angel came to them and said um
[2:52] he told them where to look there's going
[2:54] to be a you go into the City and you'll
[2:57] find a little baby in a manger and all
[2:59] of a sudden a host of angels appeared
[3:01] and said glory to God in the highest and
[3:04] peace on Earth a good will toward men
[3:06] because all the all down through history
[3:08] man had been uh trying to get to God
[3:11] trying to come into the get into the
[3:14] holy of holies where we could have
[3:16] fellowship with God and it was a great
[3:18] goal between us and God and uh what the
[3:23] Angels were declaring was
[3:24] that
[3:26] our our warrant against the Flesh and
[3:28] all of this uh warring in ourselves was
[3:31] going to come to an end by this little
[3:33] baby in a Manger who's going to come and
[3:35] bring peace in our lives
[3:37] set up one day a new kingdom on Earth
[3:40] where peace would rain but uh first
[3:43] peace would have to come into our hearts
[3:45] where um
[3:48] Peace by the Holy Ghost you know you go
[3:51] through when you're seeking the Holy
[3:52] Ghost you're uh your uh wondering your
[3:56] uh like going through the the holy place
[3:58] in the in the Tabernacle where there was
[4:01] no place to rest there's you either got
[4:03] the table of showbread and uh all the
[4:07] different all the different uh
[4:08] Furnitures and in the Holy place the
[4:11] only place to rest was on the mercy seat
[4:14] that was the only seat in the Tabernacle
[4:16] the only only resting place the only
[4:19] place that you can find true peace is in
[4:23] Christ
[4:25] now let me pull out my notes
[4:38] so um
[4:42] the Shepherds were in the field
[4:45] and the angel declared look for the
[4:47] Angels declared glory to God in the
[4:49] highest and on Earth peace and Welding
[4:51] toward them in now in this day of all
[4:54] days
[4:55] pieces is so uh it's it's so
[4:59] uh it's something the world can't
[5:01] understand it's like like Rahab when she
[5:04] was actually on the wall
[5:06] but she had peace because she had that
[5:08] little cord hanging outside of her
[5:09] window
[5:10] and now we uh you look around and you
[5:12] see all the turmoil and uh worry about
[5:15] who's going to be the next president and
[5:17] uh all of the different earthquakes and
[5:20] diverse places and things that the
[5:22] prophets foretold at the end time and
[5:24] the only only way to have true peace the
[5:28] only way to rest easy at night is to
[5:30] have the peace that only comes from God
[5:33] and God wants us to have peace he
[5:36] doesn't want us to uh there's so many
[5:38] promises that if you read through the
[5:39] New Testament about having peace in your
[5:41] life and if you have peace in your life
[5:43] then you will make peace you're not when
[5:46] people say ill about you you don't rile
[5:48] up and and uh oh I'm gonna
[5:52] face because you're spitting mine that
[5:54] kind of thing and God Christ was our
[5:58] example when he was here on the Earth
[6:00] all the time
[6:02] uh but it's interesting that it's kind
[6:05] of paradoxical paradoxical paradoxical
[6:08] because the the Declaration from the
[6:10] Angels was peace on Earth
[6:13] oh
[6:15] um all you don't have peace now you all
[6:18] these through history you've Ward and
[6:20] things but now a savior is coming to
[6:22] give you peace but in Luke 12 51 Jesus
[6:26] says suppose ye that I am come to give
[6:28] peace on Earth
[6:29] but I tell you Nave but rather division
[6:32] far from his fourth there shall be five
[6:34] in one house divided three against two
[6:36] and two against three the father shall
[6:39] be divided against the sun and the son
[6:40] against the father the mother against
[6:42] the daughter and the daughter against
[6:43] the mother the mother-in-law gets her
[6:46] daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law
[6:47] against her mother-in-law
[6:49] because when God gives you that peace
[6:51] then it creates divisions it just
[6:54] naturally creates enmity with those that
[6:56] don't have the same peace the people
[6:59] that you work with see uh it causes
[7:04] strife and division
[7:07] it's just a natural law
[7:11] in the in the beginning when God created
[7:13] he made life to come into existence and
[7:16] then he separated the light from the
[7:17] darkness it's like when he shines the
[7:20] light of the Gospel into your soul then
[7:22] you become separated from Darkness from
[7:24] the things of the world
[7:26] I mean job 22 21 he said acquainted now
[7:30] thyself with him and be at peace thereby
[7:33] good shall come unto thee
[7:35] and in Colossians 1 19 23 for it please
[7:38] the father that in him should all
[7:40] fullness dwell and having made peace
[7:42] through the blood of his cross by him to
[7:45] reconcile all things unto himself
[7:48] by him I say whether they be things in
[7:50] Earth or things in heaven and you that
[7:52] were sometime alienated and enemies in
[7:55] your mind by Wicked works yet now hath
[7:58] you reconciled in the body of his flesh
[8:01] through death to present you holy and
[8:03] unblameable and unbelievable in his
[8:05] sight
[8:06] if you continue in the faith grounded
[8:09] and settled and be not moved away from
[8:11] the hope of gospel which ye have heard
[8:13] and which was preached to every creature
[8:16] which is under heaven
[8:18] Paul the peace comes from being
[8:22] reconciled to God by the Holy Ghost
[8:25] thank you
[8:27] and it uh like Paul said it's it's to
[8:31] them that will receive it
[8:35] in uh Shalom 1964 brother Brown said
[8:38] remember
[8:39] when the full Bible listen and closing
[8:41] when this full Bible has been thoroughly
[8:43] Vindicated then there will be an eternal
[8:44] Shalom Eternal peace he come and said he
[8:48] was peace on Earth a good will towards
[8:50] man but the world didn't receive it see
[8:53] he was peace to everyone that come to
[8:55] him for peace see peace on Earth to
[8:58] build a will to man he was the Peace at
[9:01] that new year beginning New Year of God
[9:06] thank you
[9:07] I believe that God wants us to have
[9:10] peace in our lives
[9:11] you um
[9:13] he doesn't want us to have to struggle
[9:16] with sleeping or not he uh
[9:19] you know you hear about or maybe you've
[9:21] had problems sleeping at night and
[9:24] things going through your mind and and
[9:26] uh you know we've all struggled with
[9:29] that but God's promises are to give us
[9:31] to give us peace and uh he will give
[9:35] that to us I believe Mark 4 38 39 said
[9:38] he was in the Hindu part of the ship
[9:41] this is a story of Jesus
[9:43] when uh
[9:45] they took a little trip they went they
[9:48] were going to take a trip in the boat to
[9:49] go across a body of water
[9:53] and along the way
[9:55] a storm came up and uh just like Rahab
[10:00] on the wall they looked around and
[10:01] everything around him was internal maybe
[10:04] we could see the same kind of thing in
[10:06] our lives today y'all everything around
[10:08] this world system seems to be just
[10:10] falling apart but um in our lives if
[10:15] we're safe inside of him
[10:17] we should be we should have the same
[10:19] kind of peace that The Peacemaker had
[10:22] when he was in that boat down in the
[10:25] bowels of it and they wanted to find out
[10:26] where is Jesus was he all upset was he
[10:28] all worried about everything and they
[10:31] went down and they found him asleep on a
[10:34] pillow in the bottom of the ship
[10:37] because he is the author of IRS he is
[10:40] The Peacemaker
[10:43] when they went down to wake him up and
[10:45] said they awake him and say in a master
[10:48] care is not that we perish
[10:51] and he arose now remember we were
[10:53] talking about how John and uh
[10:57] and Jesus when they were at the River
[10:58] Jordan they both knew what their place
[11:01] was they both knew what they were
[11:02] supposed to do remember brother Randall
[11:04] talked about how David when he had been
[11:06] anointed he didn't fear the life
[11:08] because he knew what his place was in
[11:11] life he knew what he was supposed to do
[11:12] and I wonder if maybe when we get on the
[11:15] other side if we could look back and see
[11:17] how God guided our path through life
[11:19] maybe we wouldn't worry so much about
[11:21] things that happened to us now and Jesus
[11:25] knew when he was on that ship he knew
[11:28] what his purpose in life was he knew
[11:30] that nothing was going to happen to that
[11:32] while he was on it and he arose now
[11:36] the piece that was inside of him because
[11:39] he is The Peacemaker he'll sleep on the
[11:41] pillar when he arose a piece that was
[11:43] inside of him came out
[11:45] and he arose and reviewed the wind and
[11:47] set under the sea peace be still and the
[11:51] wind ceased and there was a great calm
[11:54] now if he's The Peacemaker and we have
[11:57] The Peacemaker inside of us and we will
[12:00] be peacemakers just like he was or he is
[12:04] because he's the same yesterday today
[12:06] and forever
[12:07] Philippians 4 6-7 he said be careful for
[12:11] nothing
[12:12] but in everything by prayer and
[12:13] supplication with Thanksgiving lets your
[12:16] request be made known unto God
[12:18] and the peace of God which passeth all
[12:21] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[12:24] Minds through Christ Jesus
[12:26] and I was I was looking at this last
[12:28] night and I was listening to some music
[12:31] while I was studying and just as I got
[12:33] to this scripture it the the music
[12:36] started playing oh what piece we often
[12:38] for first oh what needless pain we bear
[12:41] all because we do not carry Everything
[12:43] To God In Prayer and you know the man
[12:46] that wrote that song is he he was going
[12:49] to get married if you hadn't heard the
[12:50] story he was going to get married and
[12:52] the day before his wedding his wife his
[12:54] fiancee died and then he came from
[12:57] Europe to the states and he fell in love
[13:00] again he was going to get married to
[13:01] this girl and she died and um and and
[13:06] then his mother fell ill and he wrote a
[13:09] poem called pray unceasing or pray
[13:12] without ceasing and they originally put
[13:15] that form to Words which became this
[13:17] song of what peace we offered forfeit
[13:19] and I believe that he had a revelation
[13:22] of what peace comes peace doesn't come
[13:24] from the things of the world it comes
[13:25] from being settled in God
[13:27] laughs
[13:30] and uh out you know I was reading this
[13:33] in Philippians but be careful for
[13:34] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[13:36] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[13:38] request be known unto God so why are you
[13:40] in your prayer with Thanksgiving because
[13:42] you believe that the things that you ask
[13:44] for God will bring to pass and brother
[13:48] Branham said the start to begin your
[13:49] prayer when you pray you may be
[13:51] wondering how should I pray he said
[13:54] start your prayer off with praise and
[13:56] then ask the things that you need of
[13:59] believing and then according to
[14:01] Philippians finish up with Thanksgiving
[14:03] because the things that you if you come
[14:06] to God with faith and you believe that
[14:07] he will give it to you according to his
[14:09] promises in the Bible then thank him for
[14:12] it and uh he'll bring it to pass
[14:21] the whole purpose of the Gospel is peace
[14:25] in Romans 10 15 and he said how should
[14:29] they preach he said maybe sin as it is
[14:30] written how beautiful are the feet of
[14:32] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[14:35] bring Glad Tidings of good things
[14:38] in Ephesians 1 9-10 having made known as
[14:41] The Mystery of his will according to his
[14:43] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[14:45] himself that in the dispensation of the
[14:47] fullness of times he might gather
[14:50] together in one thing all things in
[14:52] Christ both which are in heaven and
[14:54] which are on Earth
[14:56] even in him because that was the purpose
[14:59] that was the Declaration that the Angels
[15:01] made to the Shepherds that this Rift
[15:03] that was between us and God we couldn't
[15:06] have Fellowship that was his purpose to
[15:08] bring peace to unite everything back
[15:10] together all in him
[15:11] our lives and uh
[15:14] you just to bring to make him all at all
[15:19] and then uh I'll finish up real quick so
[15:23] that um we can do the little a little
[15:25] bit of thing in 1955
[15:29] the uncertain sound
[15:31] brother Branham said that a Believer
[15:34] will make peace just like Jesus did when
[15:36] he was on the boat
[15:39] every man or woman that's ever tried to
[15:42] live for God is accused of ungodly
[15:44] things
[15:45] he's a witch he Bewitched in Greece he
[15:47] had so much power of God in him so much
[15:49] not witchery but what was it the hidden
[15:52] power of God that was in him he looked
[15:53] like a man he eat like a man he slept
[15:56] like a man he cried like a man he was in
[15:57] him he was a man but God was in his man
[16:00] the blessing was in the man blessed is
[16:02] the man said David
[16:04] no uncertainty to him
[16:06] that man knows what he's talking about I
[16:09] don't care what the world says what you
[16:12] say about him try to make you mad you
[16:14] won't get mad I don't care how much you
[16:16] talk about it he won't pay no attention
[16:18] to it he will go on because he's got a
[16:20] blessing in here he will pray for you
[16:23] that's right you might do anything in
[16:24] the world he paid he never pay no
[16:26] attention to it he won't back by his
[16:28] neighbors and go around and stir up
[16:30] trouble he will be a peacemaker he will
[16:33] do everything he can for he's a child
[16:35] God blessed is that man you can see how
[16:39] the blessed is the are the peacemakers
[16:42] ties into the the final the eighth
[16:45] beatitude blessed are they that are
[16:47] persecuted now when they persecute you
[16:50] and you will be persecuted as a
[16:52] Christian because it's a promise from
[16:54] God you will people will say hateful
[16:56] things about you and uh I was watching
[16:59] one of the uh years ago there was this
[17:02] brother at brother business church that
[17:04] the people that worked with him would
[17:05] take him out and throw him in the
[17:06] dumpster because he was a Christian and
[17:09] uh maybe you might not have had
[17:10] something that bad happen in your life
[17:12] but
[17:13] um we'll talk about that in the next
[17:16] couple more lessons how you will be
[17:18] persecuted
[17:20] and uh I'm gonna turn it over to June
[17:26] times
