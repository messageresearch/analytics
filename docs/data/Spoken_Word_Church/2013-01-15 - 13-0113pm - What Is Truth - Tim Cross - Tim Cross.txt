========================================

is longer is no longer me is maybe not that esther knows the song but you probably all don't know this song we used to sing a platform and i thought of saying it new years time okay i'm saying we used to sing this song back home in kenya um i don't know if it's fun here but i wanted to sing it new years but we didn't have enough time take my life and let take my moments and my days praise take my take my feet and let them be take my voice and let me see always take shall choose and make it fine he shall be no longer mine take my heart and i will be me back in that same book they're on page five baby and amen and we'll look we'll stand while we're singing we need everybody is arrive at home oh my god is you are oh is lord you are more lord you are beautiful this morning looking forward this afternoon for another message lord because we believe it got down right at the end of the message a little bit this morning that i got where i could see hey yeah right i never could figure out what it was though i didn't know where my voice came back because when i was singing or whether i i learned something i didn't ever know in my life we always know that you know foreign but i've never heard of the cross sit down i saw that i said well i got to go this evening now we appreciate the lord coming down and touching us and awesome let's just sing open the eyes of our heart brother cross comes to speak unto us the word of the lord that's what we believe that's right faith comes by hearing but somebody's gotta pray okay open the eyes i want to see to see in the light of your glory oh what they long to see we have lived to see glory i bless you this evening you may be suited um i don't know if it was requested for my wife to sing again or not and um we appreciate the lord it's a i was listening recently to a tape of a man that i have a lot of respect and admiration for for the dead days going on to be with the lord but i would he was he was preaching on halloween but he was talking about serving the lord or serving the devil and he said i've had more fun and i've been more places and i've seen more things and done more things serving the lord than i would have ever had the opportunity to do if i had served the devil all right and i wow i realize i'm in the same position i've i've met more people right i've been more places i've seen more of the world and enjoyed every minute of it than i ever would have had i've gone the other path right so that's right um seek you first the kingdom of god that's right all these other fightings amen come on sweetheart and just worship the lord so when the valley the mountains to see the body is resources we've given our own in jesus name we press on in jesus we find the strength to is is is is oh yes it is is to press on so oh my hey hearing that song and makes me think of the time you know the bible speaks of david's those mighty men and one of them is a man who took a sword and went to fight and you just fall and you fall and you fall and you fall and you know sometimes you can get so wrapped up in what you're doing that you forget about anything else that's going on around you and this was such an outstanding example to me because when he was done he was all alone who whoever been fighting with him he had either finished perished or just pulled back but all of his enemies were dead and the bible says they had to take that man's sword and pry and i say lord you know i think what that said to me was sometimes god wants someone who's willing someone who's available right my father-in-law brother hughes says sometimes availability is more important than ability right yeah god just needed one man and his resolve his determination just to stand there and hold that sword enabled god to work through him till every enemy was dead even though i i suppose it never occurred to him that he's fighting by himself right doesn't really matter right when god's fighting through you right right it doesn't matter how many people see it the way you see it or feel the way you feel or are there to encourage you god's there that's all that matters and i hope i hope that someday if if i lay down have to lay this body down they'll have to pry this out of my hands and say brother tim just would never let go amen when our captain shows up to call us amen god bless you let's stand this evening and um brother samuel sure it's good to have you here amen and i don't ever um it just feels more comfortable when the shepherd's here everybody can just relax so it feels better to me too that's right and let's read tonight in st john chapter 18 and verse 33 i'm going to attempt to uh speak on a subject this evening that i've never attempted before although um i might have touched on it and i sometimes you feel like you're going into a serving where you don't quite know how it's all going to turn out you know you've got the ingredients yeah but but you don't know if it's actually going to come out of the oven half break still need a little license put on it you know what i'm saying that's where i'm at tonight writers are you bear with me uh we're going to read from saint john chapter 18 beginning at verse 33 all right then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews jesus answered him sayest thou this of thyself sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me right pilate answered am i a jew thy no nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what has thou done right there's a lot going on here in this exchange right yeah i i cannot go into all the details tonight but it's tremendous amen all of these every word that's coming out of pilate's mouth is very guarded right and every word that's coming out of jesus mouth is divine right verse 36 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king in other words jesus said that's not my word that's your word thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate saith unto him what is truth that's my title tonight what is truth because brother sister this the question that was on pilate's heart then is still on the hearts and minds of every single individual on the earth today what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault right at all right yep amen amen let's approach the author of this word lord jesus i realize father god even with a limited understanding how incapable i am lord of imparting anything but father i also realize how capable you are of healing of saving of delivering of rapturing with god all things are possible amen so father i ask you lord as you are present with us here this evening lord to impart unto each of your children and to myself as well tonight that portion that we would have need of father that when we leave here this evening we may go forth edified uplifted strengthened encouraged and be better soldiers better servants lord and better witnesses unto thee and ambassadors of the kingdom of heaven we ask that you'll grant it lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen may god bless you you may be seated now i'm going to start tonight by making a statement and as you already know if you were here this morning i have no reservations about throwing my family under the bus so i'm gonna set this like brother brandon will do i'm gonna set this little bottle up here and i'm going to tell you something about my mom and dad that if i forget to come back at the end of the service and and wrap it up somebody's got to remind me okay and go away i'm charging you with that now here's what i'm going to tell you about my mom and dad uh they were introduced to the message and they were part of the uh they were tied in with the believers who in that time believed they were looking for the coming of the lord to take place in 1977 and that was a very uh predominant right belief amongst message believers from the 60s and into the early mid 70s i mean i don't know maybe 6 out of 10 believers we're looking for brother brown's prediction to be fulfilled right and so um you know some people just went hog wild i mean they went out and racked up debt credit cards homes boats houses land all these things and then when when january 1st 1978 happened and they realized they had got something wrong a lot of them just fell off right yeah now i want to ask you a question were they true believers be hard for me to say they were because if something like that could shake them loose would make it hard for me to to discern that or judge that as being a true believer right because a true believer goes back and instead of examining the absolute they would examine themselves right to say did i see it right was my view correctly did i have the sites lined up correctly you know we were talking about that yesterday in the minister's meeting about how brother billy paul used that illustration of the bible and the message saying you've got to get the sights are lined up correctly every time right and you know i've shot guns enough to realize um sometimes the gun can be perfectly aimed right but you got to pull the trigger and it's your eye that really makes that determination as to whether or not you're on target yeah right and and can i say it like this when brother branham hands us the message and when brother branham hands us the bible it's a perfectly aimed gun amen we don't need to make any adjustments right for windage elevation temperature humidity barometric pressure we need to get our head down on the stock of that rifle right and when we get our eye in the correct position we'll see the target and we'll see the bible and the message say exactly the same thing then all we got to do is pull the trigger and we hit the target right right but many times we you know we got too much fat on our cheek or our eyes sagging or this or that i've shot i've shot i understand how this all works and we say well the stock needs to be adjusted i need to raise the comb i need to lower the tip i know there's nothing wrong with the gun all right the problem is your angle right the problem is just and you don't even have to look at this life just pull the trigger right it'll fire and it'll hit the devil and it'll do the job every time right that's the truth process faith is that simple amen faith says i believe what brother graham said boom there he goes right right i believe what the best but the bible says boom there he goes you don't have to look at the sites right right if you have confidence in the man who set up the rifle right now and you have confidence that nothing's changed and god doesn't change it just pull the trigger yeah it'll kill the devil it'll kill sickness it'll kill disease it'll kill cancer it'll bring your loved ones in and it'll do everything it said it would do amen just pull the trigger all right that will cost you a dime amen my parents were looking for the coming of the lord in 1977. now here's what i'm going to tell you and then i'm going to stop it they missed it but only by one week now they only missed it by a week all right well i got you thinking now all right so let's move on jesus comes one day in the town and and he finds a more a grieving family mary and martha their brother lazarus has died and now they weren't just hey they were platinum members right in jesus name right yeah right they weren't at the gold level or the silver level they were platinum five man they kept them in their home you know what i'm saying in these charismatic ministries nowadays you can get in at the gold silver platinum level depending how much money you send in right you know and the correspondence you get back is largely depending on how much you send in you know you need to plant a seed and you can plant a big seed or a little seed or five dollar cedar now jesus ministry wasn't like that but what i'm saying is martha and mary were his closest some of his closest friends and associates so in our minds we have expectations for what that should do for us in the event that we should ever need something from the ministry and so here jesus comes back and they're weeping and they're saying lord if you had only been here our brother would not have died which was true to a degree he was the resurrection uh he never attended a funeral that remained a funeral that always turned into a resurrection i mean they had a track record right to go off of and so you know and so jesus says i am the resurrection yeah yeah and the life is oh yeah yeah we we got that we know that in the future there's going to be this great resurrection and and all the dead in christ shall rise and even in fact and one day everybody's going to write so yeah you know jesus said i am the resurrection right where have you laid him right okay i'm going to i'm going to leave that there and i'm going to move to a time there was a story coming all the way across the atlantic ocean from the country of england that there was a welsh revival going on yeah so some guys you know had enough money gotta get their plane tickets and we're gonna go check out this welsh revival the prophet of god tells us the story i'm i'm using it to dramatize they fly over there they land and no doubt they're looking for a tent they're looking for multitudes of people they're looking for cars lying down the streets filling up the parking lot all the things that we associate with what a revival is right and they're not finding any of that and so finally they reach a police officer and he's got a little billy club twirling around singing and i like to say it like this he's singing i'm one of them right i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can say well then they say um sir we're looking for the wealth revival have you heard of it he just keeps singing i'm one of them do you know where it is i'm one of them and finally he he said look you all don't get it do you i am the western all right amen right i am the welsh reviver you found it right you're here i'm one of them right man that this welsh revival is in the hearts of a of a farmer a banker a fisherman a a a politician or you know somebody works down for in the government office in the in the bureau and the state agency the the revival is not an event so much it's a person right oh just like mary and martha the resurrection is not so much of an event as it is a person right here's my point sometimes we're looking for a thing or a place or an event when what we're actually looking for is a person right right exactly what we're actually needing is a person right well sometimes we're looking for a person right you've seen these little wall ads they say s w f i s o s w m anybody know what that means single white female in search of a single white male oh and they've got all kinds of acronyms they you know it might be a b it might be a w it might be a lgbt i mean you know what i'm saying they've got all these acronyms now but it's a person in search of a person right and sometimes they're not just single they're single again and the churches now you go out these big churches have had these signs i've seen them say divorce with god yeah divorce with god g grace o optimism the dignity divorce with grace optimism and dignity and i'm thinking there's only one thing wrong with that sign it doesn't need to say divorce with it needs to say divorced from right right because that church that denominational church that harlot daughter is divorced from god right right by their own choosing the laodicean church is divorced from god they close the door they put christ on the outside his own church and they are the ones you know what i'm saying i'm not throwing off on people who are divorced i understand sometimes people land in a divorced condition as totally apart from their own choices or decisions but you see what i'm saying we've got single sink couples single again all these different things now that that that we're trying to cater to right people are in search of a person right right who they're really searching for is jesus christ but they're thinking well i didn't find it in in a heterosexual so maybe i'll find it in a homosexual i didn't find it in a white man maybe i'll find it in a black man or a woman vice versa right now they're searching for a person but they don't realize what they're searching for is jesus now there's a sister as a good friend of ours she wrote a song i have found the more you've been searching for it yeah people so many times are searching for more right and they don't realize we found it by the grace of god we've found the very thing they're searching for right and sometimes we let the devil make us ashamed right or closed up about the greatest thing that god could ever impart to a man or a woman and we let the devil beat us over the head with it and act like we're second-class citizens because we're message believers we're the only sane people right living here on the earth now we're the only people with the right mind because we have the mind of christ amen it's the rest of them that are insane right or or are going insane because they're searching they're scrambling they're trying to find a drug a peel a drink a concoction a recipe something to satisfy a longing that god put there and only god can feel right right so pilate was saying this what is truth what is truth but truth is not a thing brother and sister right truth is a person and the person of truth was standing there in front of heaven if jesus could it could have replied and he said you're looking at him right you're talking to him right truth amen is you are standing in the presence of truth right amen and how you react how you judge how you determine we'll determine your future right amen we'll determine everything about your life from this point forward amen that's the truth brother sister now i put myself in pilot shoes he was a kid or pilot was maybe not a king but a governor i should say he was a governor there over a roman province and he was accountable to uh the um the the uh the the highest roman authority which would have been what do they call those guys the roman um season emperor yes the roman emperor would be at the top of the food chain pilate was somewhere down here like middle management right so if jesus would confess to being a king then pilate would have roman jurisdiction to put him to death by crucifixion for insurrection for basically trying to establish a kingdom within the roman kingdom that would break roman law and therefore pilate would have roman reasons now because he was a roman governor right but he couldn't even get that on jesus because it it remember it wasn't pilate that wanted to crucify him it was the jews he was the religious leaders it was the chief priest right now uh and i may be getting a little bit ahead of myself but let me let me back up and say this no doubt pilate was was really just weary with all of the unrest on the turmoil all the bickering all the fuss and all the complaining he sees all the good that jesus is doing multitudes are following they're being healed he's cleaning out funeral homes hospitals all these different things and pilots ain't wonderful wonderful i don't have a problem with that but at the same time the jews and this is a jewish land the religious leaders who are the controlling faction there for the jewish people they're all torture pieces about this because this is crushing their idols their little glass cases that they put their god in and the mosaic their interpretation of the mosaic law and the torah and all these things jesus is just smashing it to bits but he's not violating one single jot or tittle of that part right he's actually manifesting it right he's actually magnifying it but because it goes so contrary to man's interpretation right of that law it's really creating problems so pilate's got a mess on his hands and so he's thinking you know i'd like to see peace i'd like to see tranquility i'd like to move on to more important things in my career as a politician right uh then have to deal with this so he this is on his mind now as jesus stands before now brother sister this case will be will prove to be the most critical trial in all the pilot's life or career right this trial right this man what will you do with this man called jesus amen he's either in your heart or he's on your hands right right amen as the prophet of god has taught us right this is the most critical moment in pilate's life and pilate's entire legacy is hinged on his ruling right in this matter right the rest of pilate's life and all the previous life of pilate will all be judged by this moment in time right what happens right here is that i'm not exaggerating this that's the truth right and pilate tried to get out of it a good politician will throw the ball in somebody else's direction so you deal with it he tossed it to herod harry put it right back on it now brother sister you are in pilate's position right right the pastor can't make that decision for you right mama can't make that decision for you your wife can't make that decision for you he's on your hands right you are the pilot right and you are gone determined whether he becomes your king or a victim of your poor judgment right amen which will in turn make you a victim of his righteous judgment amen amen all right can you follow me all right all right now we can look back 2 000 years ago hindsight's 2020 we could see some problems with this whole thing of pilot being blocked number one you should never make a king a judge it's a problem it's a conflict right because a king is a political office he's either voted in or he inherits that throne right a judge should be an appointed office based on the merits based on the training the education the schooling and his proven record as being a just judge judges should never be elected they should be appointed based on good track record of being a fair and equitable judge of the law is that right a king is a politician he's got to play politics he's got to appease the majority of the people in order to keep his office so when you mix that interest with the interest of justice it's like oil and water it does not mix you cannot do both well you will fail at one or both of those so we we've got a problem already by making pilate a judge there's only one king whoever makes a good judge and that's the king of kings he's a wonderful king he's a wonderful judge he also happens to be a wonderful advocate amen oh he's the prince of peace he's the counselor the mighty god the rosa sharon the lily and the valley the bride and morning star he's good at everything he does amen because he's god amen solomon was a good king and a good judge only because god was expressing his kingly attributes right through solomon right solomon leaned on the king of kings solomon leaned on the judge and he had a pretty good record as long as he leaned on him right but you see as a rule making a man who's a king a judge is typically not going to have some disastrous results right this is why and i'm not a lawyer and i'm no expert on on our judicial system but the american uh our government is set up with a judicial and a legislative branch right one writes the laws that's the legislature one uh rules on those laws or executes themselves that's the judicial that's right you should never cross those two right right they call it legislating from the bench all right and and this is the whole problem with our supreme court now is because the the sitting president of the united states gets to appoint who those judges are and it gets reviewed and it gets voted on the problem with that is that president is usually either a democrat or a republican so he's got political interests and he has been propped up by people with an agenda and he's got to appease those people so he's going to select the judges that he appoints the supreme court based on the interest of that political party or the agenda that he is representing right amen now the only way it's ever going to work is we get it back on god's way the american way is a fairly good way relative to the rest of the world but it's also a roman system right and the roman system by prophecy has proven to be nothing more than power waiting to happen right amen dust waiting to happen amen because we know by daniel's prophecy the roman empire in its final state will be dust right is that right so america is ashes right right right yeah we already know that thank you right tim i'm an american you're stepping on my toes i'm an american too but i'm a christian first right i'm a christian then an american amen i want to be out of here when america reaches her final result right right all right here are you with me tonight i love america i believe in being patriotic but i am loyal first of all to this word because that is the essence of who i am right i must be loyal to who i am as a son or as a daughter of god amen to lay that loyalty on the shelf and put precedence of being an american citizen above that right is a fault on my part amen right all right pilate saw jesus as the source of all the problems i didn't have these problems 35 years ago these problems all started 20 something years ago you know when he showed up in the temple at 12. right yeah right there there was static static between this 12 year old boy and the religious leaders right and even between his mother and father uh you know i must be about my father's business a little bit of static there right i've got news for you you're going to hit some static right as a son and daughter of god you're going to hit static right right that's right just i i'm sorry to break the news to you this is not a picnic this is a war this is a battle wars are about conflict right wars are about confrontation right wars do at some point require some courage a word we don't hear much about nowadays everybody wants to be a politician nobody wants to be a fighter right nobody wants to be a warrior or take a stand for what's right everybody wants to appease both sides of the aisle both sides of the coin and brother and sister there comes a time when right is right wrong is wrong you got to take a stand for what's right let the chips lie where they fall amen and the right will prevail the right is going to come out on the top i've got news for you now but we must take a stand for what is right amen right my i told my wife this morning i said you know what i would rather be respected than light right absolutely there are people who i know don't like me yeah because i can't go along with them i'm talking about family members oh you won't you come to my second or third wedding no i'm not coming because that preacher is going to say is there anyone in here who can show just cause why these kids are not walking together and i don't think you want me to i don't think you want me standing up so in order to to keep you from being uncomfortable i'm just going to i i i'm just going to step back now i'm not saying you need to be that way i'm just saying how i am well i got some static over that and i said look i love you i love you but i cannot condone right your actions i love you but i don't love what you're doing right now right if you were opening up a liquor store and said timothy will you come to the grand opening i'm not coming right because for me to be there would in some way send out the message that i convey or that i condone the grand opening of this liquor store i love you but i'm not coming to the grand opening of your liquor store right because i don't condone the cell of alcohol and liquor and all those things you understand right right oh my what a mess we're in now i've got the now i've got the bootleggers mad at me i'm supposed to be preaching on hunting fish but it's the truth brother sister right it's the truth and that don't make us a judge right right but you know how i'm really going to get in the mess here i went to overseas one time and there was a brother there that had done some very very wretched things and he kind of smoothed it over with all the americanos all the brothers on the other side of the atlantic he had kind of smoothed it over but he didn't make full restitution and reconciliation with the folks he had violated so when we got over there he invites us into his home and says come over have supper with us which we did i didn't even know this brother i was just along for the ride you know young young brother tim first mission trip i'm naive and i'm ignorance is bliss and i'm loving it hey all you know what broke loose we went in that brother's home and had suffered with him yeah we'd been there for a week and a half and just just hung over us like a black cloud but brother when we went into his home and sat down at his table and partook of a meal with him we might as well have put our strength right our blessing we might as well have just condoned every action that i ever made in their culture right when you go into their home and you partake of a meal with them you are putting your blessing on their life and their actions and we didn't know what the man's actions were right because we'd been lied to sure but brother we sure found out real quick what did he give to you you got to be careful right paul said with fornicator adulterer don't even eat women that's right because it sends a message that's that's the truth now you can get real legalistic with that and probably go overboard but it does send a message you you put your hand to something you put your blessing on it you better be willing to live with your reputation right right that you're going to gain as a result of that right just be the same thing if you've got a michael jackson poster up right is he guilty i don't know yeah right where there's smoke there's fire they say i don't know if the man's guilty or not but i'm not putting his posters up on my wall because i don't condone the music that he's saying much less what is reportedly a problem or a weakness that the man had in his life i you know when michael jackson be there i don't know but i doubt it but either way i'm not putting his posters up on my wall right right because to me he's a pervert right to me he is a vessel that satan ministered through and i and i hear that when he died on facebook there were believers posting these remorseful things be careful brother sister that's right let god be his judge you the bible says by the fruits you shall know them right amen judge the fruits let god determine what the tree is right amen he didn't give me a whole lot of evidence to go on to judge him and brother brenham said elvis sold his soul for a fleet of cabinets and called him a modern day judas is scary now if the prophet said that about him i'm not apologizing for that right brother brandon said it i say with what brother brennan said amen michael jackson to me was a modern day uh an even worse form and version of elvis presley now i'll get off of that because i made i made the michael jackson's fans man i'll tell you when i was in elementary school they wanted us to sing we are the world we are the children yeah we are the ones to make a brighter day so let's start living yeah you know what i want to sing it right i had enough god in me through my godly parents to know there's something wrong with that man and something wrong with his music right yeah right and i could realize even at six years old i'm not the world yeah you say you're the world if you had to i'm not the world right now jesus said this ain't my kingdom this ain't my kingdom brother sister michael j elvis is not my king he might be the king of rock and roll i'm not rock and roll michael jackson might be the king of pop i'm not pop right right man i'm the word all right amen when you've seen the father when you've seen me you've seen the father i come from god and i return to god i identify with this word right amen amen my king is god right amen i don't know who your prophet is my prophet is william branham he's still my prophet amen you say brother he's dead in the grave he's still the prophet and the holy ghost is the prophet to the age i don't know who you're following but i know i'm following god through his vindicated servant messenger oh i've stopped on all kind of toast now man but i believe it's the truth right and if i didn't tell you what i believe i'd be hypocritical right that's right bro amen as far as i know they didn't invite a hypocrite here to preach inviting me here totally be myself for better for worse amen so pilate saw jesus as the source of all his problems well you could in one way of looking at it he was but in another way of looking at it jesus could have been the solution right that's right all depends how you deal with it right exactly and the same thing is happening again today sure jesus is on trial again today right right amen now i'm going to try to wrap up so listen to me he's not on trial as a galilean yeah wearing yeah middle eastern clothes with a beard and shoulder-length hair right no no that's right that's jesus of 2000 years ago right now he's the same yesterday that's right but the form right that he has revealed himself in this album right is very much on trial again right right all you say brother tim you're talking about the message i am talking about that's right but i'm not necessarily talking about the little little paperback books or big paperback books or cds and dvds and mp3s and no i'm not talking about information right the message is not just data right right it's not just letters on the page or audio on on a set on a real or however digital whatever it's not the message is more than that amen right i want to tell you the bible is more than this book the bible is a life all right the word of god is a life the message is a life amen and where the the form that god is revealing himself in now amen is living bride right amen wife right misses jesus christ amen the bride is the body of christ upon the earth now living walking talking breathing working coming to church paying their taxes paying their tithes driving around flying around the world doing missions work preaching all these different things that is the body of jesus christ here today upon the face of the earth now are you part of that body i mean by god's grace we are part of that body but now we are on trial today right right we are under the microscope right we are in the in the aquarium right and the world is looking in saying what kind of creature is that yeah what kind of life is that that's insanity why they're listening to tapes of a man that's 50 plus years ago and they haven't even upgraded them yeah hello we're also still using this old black book amen that has never been upgraded because it's the truth of god's word and he's the same yesterday today and forever i am the lord thy god and i change not amen why doesn't he change because he doesn't need to why doesn't he improve because it's not possible why doesn't he update because it's unnecessary he is right right he just is right right he's not was or will be he is he is god he's the author of life right he's that he's not he's not just the source of our healing he is our human right he's not just the source of our salvation he is our salvation he's not just giving us rapturing faith he is our rapture he is our boaz he's our king he's our groom he's our judge he's our attorney he's all of these different things right amen oh hallelujah when you when if you're a criminal and you're guilty and you walk into the courtroom you see that man there in the black room and fear grips you because you know you're guilty and you know your destiny rests in the hands of that man amen yeah but he's just a man he's probably a husband he's probably a father he probably likes to play golf or hunt or fish or any of these things right and you know what but you're fearful of him because of how you relate to him and how he relates to you right right you know what that same man in that same robe could go walking through the door of his soul and his wife you didn't take out the trash she's not scared of him at all but he might be a little fearful of her but it's their relationship to him right you can see the lion you can see the judge you can see the king sitting on the throne and don't scare you a bit because oh that's my groom that's my savior that's my redeemer i wasn't thawing his mind before the foundation of the world i know that and not to be disrespectful but i know him right amen amen i'm related to him right i'm ken folks with him i'm actually his family all right oh now i'm getting back on this morning's message you know some people look at us sometimes they say why does he act that way and they said well if you knew his dad yeah or if you knew his brother or if he knew his past well they do the same thing as christians right if you really knew who my daddy was yeah and you really knew where i came from and you really knew where i'm going then you wouldn't wonder so much while i dress the way i dress walk the way i walk talk the way i talk and i go because this is the way everybody does it where i'm from some of you some of you here are from kenya is that right they dress a certain way in kenya right if i try to dress that way you say what is brother tim trying to be all right exactly what what's he trying to looking like a kenyan what's the matter with him he's a southern he's an american yeah but for them to dress like that is entirely appropriate right right and they say well that's the way everybody dresses where i come from when you show up at school with your long hair and your uh uh no earrings no tattoos none of this garbage on you hey man they go where'd you come from where did you come from right well i know where i come from right and i know where i'm going everybody dresses like this where i come from amen that's right is that brother roy swafford no you just look like him i'm sorry brother brother roy swaff is a fine brother and a handsome brother and you look just like you can get in trouble you know but you know something else and now i'm just i'm just i'm just lost but you know something don't forget uh yeah and i didn't forget that i just don't know how i'm gonna get from work from here to that you know when you go to the airport you can kind of tell where people are going oh yeah all right if you see a man dressed up in a parka and three pairs of pants yeah and wool socks don't go up and ask that man if he's going to siberia yeah he's not going to sit no don't ask him if he's going to florida there you go y'all got it you can tell by the way he's dressed where he's going now that guy that's wearing bermuda shorts and a tropical uh t-shirt or you know lostly flip-flops and standing around there you know and you see he's already got his little umbrella drink in his hand he's already there in his mind he's just a few hours away so he's already acting like where he's going and that's the way the bride is hallelujah that's the way joshua and caleb work we're already in katy lane i've already got my house built i've already got my billion planner i've already got it all sorted out right here because i'm already there it's all i'm waiting for is the shout out everybody heard the shout out all i'm waiting for is the voice and the trump amen but i've already heard the message i've already gotten the orders right it's just a matter of time right now you understand what i'm saying that's why we act the way we act right right that's why we're dressed the labor drives because we we're going somewhere right it may be 30 below zero at the airport yep but you're dressed in khakis and a light shirt yep because you're going to florida right right i don't care what's going on here in laodicea i'm not going to land to see you right i'm going home right here so no matter what the fashions of laodicean does has no bearing on me that's just the airport right right i'm dressed for the destination my expectations amen have prepared me for the destination and i believe now it's boarding time amen i mean now the final boarding call is going forth amen passengers such and such and so and so amen the plane is at the gates the engines are spooling up the lights are flashing the gate is closing children get on board it's time we're going home all right hallelujah amen jesus is on trial again the word is on trial again but now it's the person of the word right it's the revealed word it's the messenger oh yes brother brown's on trial yeah any of y'all got any of y'all got the internet yeah brother branham is on trial sure that's right they're trying a man that that died not not literally but in a sense died in 1965 right and he's on trial yeah his message is on trial his ministry is on trial and you know what you're next that's right right that's right you're next we're in the pre-trial hearing right now the depositions are being made right and the prosecuting attorney which believes this message is a fallacy and actually doesn't even believe the bible although they claim they do they're bringing in the evidence now to determine what is admissible and what's inadmissible right right and i got to tell you that they're not taking this to the state court no they're not taking this to a district court right they're not taking this to the supreme court because if the truth be told much of the logic that is going into their argument wouldn't even stand up right right in a county court right no all right that's right in a county court judge with half a brain would throw out their case based on their evidence okay so you don't have 17 death certificates for 17 men that fell off the louisville municipal bridge so what they were lucky to have birth certificates back then much less death certificates throw that out throw that out that's not even evidence that's not even good circumstantial evidence that's a bunch of hogwash that the devil has thrown up to try to make to manifest the make believer and the unbeliever right right and you will be successful all right oh i got news for you i can tell you how this case is going to turn out already they'll never change a bride member into a foolish virgin hallelujah i've got my mind made up and i won't turn back hallelujah they'll never win the case here because my womb is sealed right my mind is already made up right i don't care if they pull out photographs that's circumstantial right i can make a photograph right now with a a a photo editing software what do they call that photoshop i could photoshop william brown sitting at the bar drinking a liquor if i wanted to drink throw it out i don't care if you got a pair up a picture of him wearing a pair of shorts yeah cool yeah oh god made a mistake my goodness god's up in heaven scratching his head there i had my prophet there i put the pillar fire over his head there i've indicated his ministry had kings and yeah and all these things prayed for and vindicated vindicative indicated medicaid and now 50 something years later they come up a photograph with him over in safari amen if i'd have been in there i'd have been wearing the same thing the prophet was right amen it don't it does not invalidate the message in any way because i got news for you the message was not a kentuckian born with the seventh or eighth grade education the son of charles and alan branham the message was the word of god jesus christ revealing himself through a son of amen we're talking about two different things here right right we're talking about a messenger and we're talking about a message right and the message was a mortal man born in sin shaken iniquity come the world speaking lives right the message was christ amen amen sinless spotless virtuous faultless that's right amen amen before during and after amen and guess what we're that word too come on oh right brother you are flawless yes because my case got thrown out of court right now the judge was biased he was married to the defendant and the attorney was his son yeah and was her husband too because they're thinking through a trinitarian mindset here's god the judge jesus the son and the holy ghost in the bride three people they don't realize they're all the same right it's all in the family amen it's all in god god god and god right god the father god the son god the holy spirit amen amen god eternal omnipotent infallibly amen heals all space and time too wonderful to be comprehended by a human mind so he continued in the form of his son right reveal himself to then come back in the form of the holy spirit and live in temples born in sin shape no iniquity scarred a man wrecked in sin but god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the sin and it blows the mind of the world and they're watching this trial saying i'm confused i'm confused this looks like a set up it is a setup amen it's a setup before the foundation of the world the judge is related to the son and they're both related to the defendant who happens to be the bride of both of them all right go figure it out amen you say brother tim you're going crazy yeah all right emma go ahead it's only crazy if you're not part of the bride right right right the bride loves it right amen she loves the setup right she keeps winking at the attorney you know he gets winking at the judge yeah anyway did you hear what that if you weren't that i think they called appointed the guy was making all the accusations i could be wrong about that i know he's a prosecuting attorney said you heard that prosecution attorney just said he just don't realize that's inadmissible evidence right do you hear what he just accused him of just shot that from the record yeah doesn't count never did it in the first place it don't matter how much that old devil stands over in the apps that's right the judge has already written his sentence all right all right pardon right right never did in the first place amen but satan can't see that he's not privy to that so he's got to play the parts right and the poor guy when it's all said and done it's going to go down as one of the biggest failures in all of his career amen right all right but now i told you and and i'm trying to come to a close here i don't have any diet packets tonight but yeah i do have to respect your time and i think we got a baby shower afterwards right the message is on trial again right but the arguments that are being made and the little things that are being thrown up like they're punching holes in the message it is absurd the things that they are throwing up to say this and somehow some way makes you know and they're saying um and i don't want to give this too much traction or give this too much attention but you know they're saying well branham tabernacle brother collins brother fill in the blank right this ministry the whole message ministry brother sister if i tomorrow go out and rob six banks turn over 20 liquor stores and i show up on the front page of the national enquirer with the most ill-famed people in the city as my companions has nothing to do with the messages we're not all it's not all one big pile of potatoes no that's right amen bread and tabernacle is a church it is sovereign it is independent is it a message believing church absolutely but brennan tabernacle is not the message right right amen for other colleagues with all and respect is not the message right he's not the spokesperson for the message that's right right the message needs no spokesperson right it speaks for itself right brother branham never needed a pr agent he never needed a marketing relations all these things now that these ministries right that's right he was god's prophet amen that in itself carries some incredible perks right that even when you do make a mistake god never changes his mind right about his decision to ordain you as his prophet right amen right right amen and when a prophet should say something that he knows could be misunderstood or could even be contrary to his own way of wanting to present it he corrects himself right that's right and if he doesn't god still vindicates it and the people who believe it still are entitled to the benefits of it right regardless right so really we're in a pretty good position as long as we don't take it upon ourselves to become the judge ourselves and start well maybe this does bear some examination here now let me see uh brother oh that it's circumstantial right all of this stuff right i'm disappointed because i thought these guys were more intelligent right than to throw some of this garbage right that's any kind of proof that the mess you say brother tim i'm going to tell them you said that i hope they're watching all right right now because they won't reply to my emails so maybe they'll reply to this message it's the truth that i'm standing on a message i'm standing where eve should have stood yes he didn't ask me to comprehend it and figure out all the intricacies and details of it he said believe it right and the rest will take care of itself right amen so i stand here before you this day by god's grace as a believer of this message amen and i say what is truth is a person right right amen the person of jesus christ has revealed himself this hour in what we call the message of the hound amen right he thought so much of his servant and prophet that he even had his photograph taken i've got news for you that wasn't a rocket trail oh right that's right that was a supernatural cloud and supernatural clouds supernatural anything are never to be understood scientifically no right i will take you back to the days of noah noah said it's going to rain science said it ain't going to rain we've got the instruments to probably ain't going to write who are you going to believe right right the supernatural vindicated prophet are the super smart scientists yeah i got news for you if you lean on this scientist they realize they were wrong only it was too late to get on that boat by the time the proof came to absolve any doubts faith is believing something that your senses won't declaration exactly it didn't take faith to feel a raindrop when the raindrops started falling the door to the ark was already closed and the believers of the prophet's message were safely sealed inside amen and the believers of the scientific world and i.e the doubters of the message were outside let me in i'm now a believer i want admission to the ark i will pay it for a ticket i'll buy your spot no you won't okay that's right i didn't buy my spot right amen silver and gold don't get you there right it takes faith in god amen simple faith in god full obedience to the entire word of god entitles you to the token the token is the bride's ticket from this disaster in that two paradise to the future home to the millennium and to rey and rule with our groom our king our husband amen our love is a revealed word of the hour no know you not that the saints shall judge the earth right right we might be judging right now right amen we're not judging through the word right right we're judging what's taking place right right now amen that's right but i'll tell you it's already done hallelujah god's already made up his mind about his children nothing's going to change it right god knows the end from the beginning god knows who was going to fall away amen yes sir i don't know where i was going to close i guess i'll just close right now amen oh get back to your mom y'all don't have a hard time believing that dude my mother and father believed along with others that the coming of the lord would happen in 1977. now remember the resurrection was a person the revival was a person right truth is a person right brother brown says rapturing faith lays in these messages right all right now i've got i got to say this brother ben says when we get there we'll be you'll be traveling like a thought now exactly how you gonna do that you tell me exactly how you're going to travel like a thought well let's back up a little bit message count down brother brothers tell us about man you know you can walk on foot i think about this you could walk probably how many of you could walk a mile probably this afternoon yeah maybe take you some take 15 minutes an hour but most of us could do a mile yeah just walking on foot wouldn't have to run yes sir okay but now let's move up can you travel like a horse oh well you could probably try you know but really you know could you get on i mean you're gonna be a kind of a mockery you know but you can travel like a horse get on a horse or get behind the horse and above you right and when you connect a horse represents a power right when you connect with that power you can travel like that power right amen and you can cover far more distance right in less time with less fatigue right right well okay can you travel like a car yep get in the car right right some some of your rednecks would say get on a car

and you can travel like can you travel like an airplane get in don't get on your wing walker but let's see what happens to them and that's the way people are about the message yeah they're on the message and they get bucked off right because the message takes a turn and they're not strapped down and there they go right right do begin the message quit polishing it right quit fussing over it yeah quit admiring it and just get in it right come on come on amen can you travel like a space rocket yeah if you so happen you can get in that oh and the space rocket is a really good type because you're not even in control that's right you're just strapped in and you're waiting on them somebody else in mission control to hit the button and then boom we're out of here into another dimension but you better be strapped in yeah strap down yep and you and you just relax yeah i'm just waiting right now can you travel like a thought yeah get in the thumb oh we they're not just good ideas or bad ideas god's thoughts are powerful right right when you become connected with it it will translate you right transport you right then from whatever you are right sinner drug addict prostitute gambler you name it hunter fisherman tax collector whatever whatever your stake is you get connected to god's mind about you right it will translate you from sin center and sinful right into righteousness justified right sanctified right filled with the holy ghost amen right and if rapturing faith lays in these messages oh i got news for you the raptor's not going to be a flurry of pages evaporating from the earth right but there's a power that lays on those pages and when it comes into the heart of men and women and they become connected with the thought of god right man it's going to translate our mortal bodies in a twinkling of an eye supreme thoughts amen amen that's good they say now how did your parents miss the rapture by the week the rapture is a person christ and the bride i was born

recognition and realization we ain't none of us going over right because the rapture is a revelation to each and every individual who makes up the rapture right and by god's grace i believe we are nearing that point that moment in time amen and it's gonna finally the last piece of the puzzle is gonna fall in place right and i don't care who is in the white house i don't care what political
