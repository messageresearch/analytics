hearts make sure it's the right thing that we receive now what we just here I I see I'm always talking about this little boy but his mama he told his mama I need my pamper changed in a way he smoked so she just left him told me to do it he took it off and threw it in a commode because that's what he had been seeing her do throw things away so when you when you when you present the wrong thing to a child they're gonna do the wrong things so when we come to church make sure that we hear and listen with the Navajo hearts and not be thanking some other other than what's being ministered to us because if we if we get the wrong thing we're going to do the wrong thing but God is here so just think of the joy that he gave us amen nobody gave it to you nobody can take it away amen we're gonna read this morning from psalm 66 verses 1 through 14. let us let us pray Heavenly Father we have a grateful and thankful for this opportunity you're given us to come together to worship father we pray

God All Ye Lands say unto God how terrible are thou in thy Works those thou gather of their power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee on Earth come and see the works of God he is terrible

we might as well stand for the truth amen good to be in the house of the Lord good to have each and every one of you here we're getting ready to put on a little Christmas program here that uh so Sister Janet and some of the different ones have put together with the young adults and and the kids so if you'll show them a little patience as they get everything ready we will uh let them get started here in just a second I'll go ahead and make a excuse me a few announcements excuse me need some water I guess number one I want to thank everybody for last Sunday for being here and giving gifts to brother Dale sister Dale myself and different ones we sure appreciate that thank you for your um loyalty of being that being here and being here during the during the year and it's just a little small token that we give back to you as a church as we gave you a little gift there of some money to uh to help you in this time so we appreciate that we appreciate you we appreciate brother and sister Dale for um putting all of it together and the Caterers and uh and all the ones that had anything to do with the uh to get together I don't like to say party get together all right so remember now as they're getting ready brother Aaron will be preaching Wednesday night okay all right and then there will be no service on the 25th that will be Christmas Day um December the 28th brother Daniel Martinez will be with us that's uh Rachel's dad and he'll be speaking for us on that Wednesday December the 28th then on December the 30th oh I want to thank everybody last night for coming to the prayer meeting we had a good little crowd we appreciate it it's it's a time to it's like brother Bob was talking about you know you um you can come to church if you want to we can't make you come to church and we can't make you come to the prayer meeting but it sure does help it helps me to come I don't know whether it helps you it helps me to come so you know it's it's a timer you say well I can pray at home well yeah you can but this is an effort and God sees that effort and when he sees that effort then he'll reward that effort you come to church he'll reward you you don't come to church and guess what that's why a lot of y'all have a lot of problems you do have because you don't come to church if them quotes wasn't enough okay right brother right everybody believe brother Brown was a prophet right there was four screens up here that had had those quotes on it about coming to church so a real true solid Christian will come to church all right and you'll get more solid as you keep coming because God promised he'd do it just like paying tithes if you know someone said one time well I can't afford to pay tithes well yeah I can't afford not to I can't afford not to that comes out first you know you you give the give it to the Lord first okay all right let me make a couple more announcements then you can sit down um December the 30th because of the prayer meeting last night I usually try to have it before we have a meeting and our meeting is going to be on December the 30th on Friday night at seven o'clock that will be December the 30th at seven o'clock brother Wayne Lawson to be with us spoke to him the other day and he's really excited about coming and then on December the 31st we'll have a normal uh watch Night Service so get your songs ready get your testimonies ready uh whatever you want to do brother Wayne will be preaching from probably about 8 30 to whenever and then we will continue to midnight and take communion just like we always do and um y'all need to bring some finger food something small don't bring fried chicken and and and you know turkey and dressing I've had enough of that never mind um just bring some finger foods all of y'all that's been here before you know what to bring so just bring it on December 31st that'll be eight o'clock till 12 o'clock midnight we'll take communion at 12 o'clock and then we will not have a service on January the 1st I'm having an issue with that because they say that what you do on the first day of the year is what you do the rest of the year so they'll brother Bob all them quotes she's talking about about not coming to church but people will be tired uh we'll be here until probably two o'clock in the morning uh fellowshipping so we just won't have church on January the 1st all right also oh brother Trevor Even's called a few minutes ago and he said just tell everybody hello and also one more thing before we get started on February the 11th we were talking about the Valentine's banquet and uh opening it up to bring somebody like brother Donnie said he'd bring his son and his wife uh the reason we're doing that is because of Outreach we're doing this so that people can see the love and see the see the joy that we have um you know the Christmas thing is intimate it's for the tithe parents it's for the people that come to church but the Valentine's banquet it is for child payers and you don't have to pay for anything but if you bring a guest you need to pay the church or bring give it to Terrence or at least that's 30 dollars all right that will cover the price pretty close to the price of the caterer all right so you can do that uh bring whoever you want to as long as their husband and wife not wife and wife or husband and husband you have to you have to cover these things you know all right so just whoever you want to bring and then we're going to have uh call Brother Dutch Scott yesterday and he's going to be with us the whole weekend him and sister April are coming and he's going to speak for us for about 20 minutes um on that night of February the 11th so we're going to change it up just a little bit I ask that you do one thing that you help because usually there's only been about 20 couples and that's about 40 people now we figure that we're going to double that probably so we'll need a little more help as far as tables and setting up and getting everything ready I know Anna mama and Lisa and Jim and all the different ones they try to help to get that thing together to put it on it is a it is an event it's not just a gathering it's an event and we appreciate everybody helping and then like I said if you want to bring somebody with you if you're a child bear payer here at church you do not have to pay but if you bring somebody with you a gift a couple then they you need to pay thirty dollars for their meal all right thereby okay with that amen I just think that we can if bring somebody bring your neighbor bring somebody you know that that that don't they even don't know the Lord because we'll have a little ceremony there and then we'll do our games and our prizes and our and our Newlywed Game you all need to start figuring out what color your walls are and what color your sheets are and what color your boy your man your man's shoe size is those questions will not be on that just because I said that right that's right all right well we're getting ready for the play We Like I said before we appreciate all these uh brother Boyd and Sister Janet and the different ones are putting the play on for us today so you may be seated and you need lights off or on oh yes brother and sister Dale last night or yesterday or day before yesterday got their uh their lift chairs and they're probably sitting in them right now watching the service so uh I got in it last night and it's pretty neat I think maybe when I get older I may have to get one myself so yummy kind of I thought maybe it would spring you out you know no it just kind of gets you really easy lifts you up but it's real comfortable for them to sit in so we appreciate their Church buying that form that's what your money bought for brother and sister Dale so God bless you lights on or off okay and when you're finished you can come back up here and sit where you're supposed to sit brother calling him is you sit in front you don't have to sit in the back okay leave that one on or not huh okay [Music] on the first day of Christmas my savior gave to me my Jesus who died for me on the second day of Christmas my savior gave

different things but Aaron will be speaking Wednesday night that's all we need to remember day day by day for the moment so I know we all have a request in our heart that um we want to take before the Lord so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you for this day that you've given us thank you for this talent that we have in this church Lord that that you have orchestrated and put together in your mind before the foundation of the world and people have come from all different parts of life of just thinking standing there looking at all the children how that they've grown up some that are growing up more some that have already grown and married and moved on maybe and having their own children Lord we we appreciate you for giving them strength and being able to marry good Christian men and women and having children and bringing them up in the admonition of the Lord and his brother Bob said we take them to church don't send them take them to church amen so I pray Lord that you just be with us now in the further with this service bless us and keep us safe be the ones that are sick Lord Brother now Sister Dale this free to different ones that are not here Lord we pray that you just touched their touch their body Lord and give them something from you father we ask these things in Jesus name amen I was just looking a few minutes ago I told Brother Joe Canada we were right there praying you know we look at um at time the time that we have to do things you know brother Brown always talks about the history talks about how that how the John Wesley's wife had ever had many kids 12 14 15 kids read Bible to them all the time didn't have a didn't have a Singer sewing machine didn't have a Maytag washing machine but she found time and I was looking online I was listening to the sister Astra Playa a Christmas song and do you know that Charles Wesley his brother we say a lot about John because he was the prophet of the day but Charles wrote 6500 hymns 6500 and he didn't have Xerox machine either he didn't have a computer that he could look up things he pinned his own notes he pinned his own I'm talking about notes for the piano and the different things he he pinned all that on his own by the inspiration of God and then I thought well Lord you know there was uh I went down a little bit further and said well who's the most famous songwriter I thought Charles Wesley was nope Fanny Crosby blind blind Fanny Crosby wrote 8 000. hymnals and poems to the Lord blind married a husband that was blind they had several children and she attended church they said she attended all the time that's where she got a lot of her inspiration maybe we get some inspiration here today but think about those ones that you'll meet on the other side you know they say Well they're not bride well you don't know that I do believe they were for their time for somebody to write that much inspiration and and and something that we now still sing uh and Fanny Crosby is one of the greatest I mean she wrote all those wonderful uh Blessed assurance and all the different ones and she knows one I know one thing for sure she's not blind today she's not blind today she is not blind she's looking around going man this is what I wrote about it but we'll see her just as sure as you'll see your wife or husband or whoever it is in a few minutes outside you'll see those two and they will be given crowns for writing that for having the inspiration to write these songs that you and I still enjoy today and Charles Wesley wrote a lot of Christmas songs too so he was uh he was a powerful man and his brother was also I'm just giving him a little time for them to all get back in here so we're gonna kind of shorten the title down to son of man because we're still on who is this son of man and we're going to get to that a little bit later but this would be part we'll still continue with part 74. in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and walked Among Us we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and what truth remember we preached on that last Sunday or last time we spoke on truth now let's look at Luke 6 verse 19 we're going to try to get into The Virtue today not to birth Jews all but the one virtue and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and he healed them all you may be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word thanks again for all of you that that had a part in it we appreciate it we thank you so very much I know they're putting stuff together downstairs uh just be patient with them as they come in and out but uh I sure enjoyed that that was good that was good it was a uh a time of reflection that we can reflect back on that God did send us a message from one man that one first first one that came up here and then after then all that I was thinking too do you know hit the the one standing right here in front wrote the Bible wrote the Ten Commandments picked the disciples created the world he did every bit of that all that whole 12 times God had something to do with it Jesus picked the tribes of Israel oh yeah you say no Jesus yeah Jehovah brother Brown said Jehovah the oldest what Jesus of the new we believe in one true and living God right so he he was the one that created all that that you see he was the Creator God and Jesus is his name so let's go now and continue on beloved when I give all diligence to writing to you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you as brother Bob was talking about exhort we want to we want to we want to persuade you or or try to get you to see the word of God and here we want to see the word of God that you should earnestly contend for what that faith that was once delivered unto the Saints in other words the truth not a truth not a part true but the truth for there are certain men and unawares which we were talking about preachers um you know being an error and dragging you away from God who are before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ you know it's not going to be I say this with with with a heavy heart it's not going to be a today of judgment the the drunk that's going to be so surprised he lived that life he knew he didn't know the Lord but what about these people that profess to be Christians and the Bible says the love of God is not in them what about Caiaphas and all the different ones that approach to Jesus and Jesus said you're of your father the devil well where are they going they're not going to heaven right so there is a dividing time and we see the dividing time coming up now and I want to read you this right here I haven't read it before but it's very familiar for all of us so now this messenger of Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 we know who that was it's going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 turn of the hearts of the children to the father so he as we were explaining before we have these great mystery truths that we're in the first church age the second Church age and maybe close to the Third Church age and then what happened man got involved and eroded the truth deluded the truth and I say man Satan through man did that to dilute the truth and make it to where you can do whatever you want to I mean my word come on people there's got to be some kind of Holiness for us to live by if we're going to be holy ghost-filled people all right something's got to be holy that works outward that gives us what Revelation to see what's right and see what's wrong like I said before you look at Pilot pilot pilate said what is truth you've got these they're one to they want to take a murderer Barabbas and let him out of prison and then they want to take supposedly their leader or the people that you know the some of the people enjoyed and they want to kill him and so Paul says what is truth he just didn't have enough information you and I cannot say that today that's right you got to know what's true and Truth has been presented when the when the Seal's broken we'll look at this afternoon I want to bring the seals in with the uh with the uh seven ads remember there's only seven ads facing on an ad it says add to your faith so we're going to start really with virtue is the first virtue because brother Brown said have faith and be born again all right so what's going to happen now what are we under what is our mandate in the end time it's not to just be somebody that's like today's school somebody just you do what you want to and act the way you want to no we have a commission that we're supposed to what go back to the faith of the fathers go back to one true and living God go back to that that's the only reason we want to go back anywhere we want to go get that faith and we kind of profit in the end time go get that faith and he brought that Faith back to me and you so that you and I can have faith all right because it's the face that was once delivered to the Saints in the first churches has now been delivered to the Saints in the end time in this seventh Church age everybody with me two Lord turn the hearts of the children to the fathers he will reveal the Mysteries number two of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 don't let that trip you up we're not going to talk about that today but you have to include it in here which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals look it will be these divinely revealed divinely reveal mystery truths not just somebody that just wrote something in a book not Charles Dobson not not yet Max Lucado and all these different ones they're good they're nice they're okay but uh they don't have all the truth they don't have the truth he said it will be these divinely revealed look mystery truths not just a truth a mystery truth that literally turns our hearts back in other words it's going to literally change your body amen this may change your attitude to have you turn back to the faith of the father that may change the way you live the way you act the way you are a Christian in the end time but this right here the opening of those seals are going to what they're going to turn us back to young men and women everybody with me that ought to make you a little bit more happy the older ones are okay about but the young guys are still like man I don't know what you're talking about when you get older right bro Kylie broccoli Smiley amen it'd be these divinely revealed mystery troops that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so and just for a moment we we looked at the word truth and I got some really good comments about this because it's something that one word that you look at and it's so convoluted it's so well as as pilate said what is truth the the Pentecostals are going to church today saying This is truth the methodists are going to church today saying this is true the Baptists are going to church and say this is truth well I'm kind of like pilate what is truth if this is truth and we sprinkle are we Baptist and we baptize or we believe in one or three or two or six or ten or whatever how many gods there's got to be one truth and Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life everything has to what come out of that that's why we're talking about these son of man because that's who that was standing here the son of man went to Calgary God in human flesh went to Calvary and you and I as being what recipients of that we can become part of that son of man in the beginning was the word where was with God the Word was God and that word was made flesh but truth means firmness faithfulness sureness reliability stability continuance faithfulness reliableness as I was listening to Bob this morning reading those quotes see I rest my soul on this word of God I rest my soul that brother Brown was a true prophet not just my body flesh I rest my soul because my my just real easy to walk into Baptist Church with your hair cut and I've seen him walk in you know with girls with shorts on and all this stuff on Wednesday nights and different things they just don't honor they just don't honor the word of God anymore they don't honor that we're going to a place of reverence to what to meet God now they just do like brother Brown said it's just a lodge yes they pay their you know Elks Club fee I hope nobody's in the Elks Club Elk Club face they pay their Elks Club fee they pay their good fellow fee and they're going to go to church come on somebody and they say that's truth but when the Bible is totally against all that so we have to read the bible let the Bible be what our standard yes all right but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper true worshiper shall worship the father and what not just spirit because you can have the spirit and not have truth come on Satan has the spirit but not the truth Satan is a spirit you know and he's a worshiper but if you get spirit and Truth together because brother Brown said one time he said Satan cannot stand the truth he hates it that's why he hates us he doesn't hate the world the world's already gone he hates us because what we come to a place that we stand and we stand in a place like brother Bob was talking about we believe Satan if we come to church we're going to make you so mad we're gonna make you so mad but you know what we're going to come back the next day we're going to come back the next Wednesday we're going to come back the next Sunday we're going to we're going to defeat him he's defeated already he just don't know it but we worship in spirit and in truth and God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in what spirit and truth so we got to worship him the same way that he is and then Jesus says look you shall know the truth so it's not a mystery that that some men say well well I don't really know what truth is or all right you know sitting back over here when he went to Nicene Council I'm sure there was a lot of people had a lot of different ideas but they had to hone it down to one idea right they agreed on though but they agreed oh they agreed on a Creed they took the Bible and said well we don't think we don't know if that's the truth or not all the truth but we'll take this part all right and you shall know the truth and the truth shall what bind you know to make you free people think we're and I still I still I get it but I don't how did people think well y'all just bless y'all poor old June and her family you know she's so bound she's so she's so in prison and well praise God Powell was a prisoner of Christ I want to be a prisoner of Christ I absolutely want to be somebody that God can use and use right in the same way with sister June but the but the world looks at you and says oh you've got to do this and you've got to do that as brother random was saying something say well you don't have to come to church and you think that's out there that's in the message don't have to go to church you can just sit and listen to or watch that's not the way God set it up and you know what when God wrote that that Bob read today he re he wrote that before the foundation of the world brother John knowing that we would have the internet knowing we would have people sit at home trying to get it for theirself I was looking at YouTube yesterday and a thing popped up says um listen to this and it was a tape church and it said tape Church somewhere in Africa and I said no I don't think I listened to that why would I listen to something I can listen to when I want to listen to it not on Sunday and Wednesday or whenever they do it so but anyway but look they have been blinded by the God of this evil age amen and it's not the evil yeah we see evil like the different things that are going on out in the world but the evil the greatest evil is is for us to sit in a sit in a Pew and die that's the greatest evil there is it's a set in the Pew and just die John 14 verse 16 said I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever what is it the spirit of truth that's why we've been harping every Minister and The Minister's out on the internet and the different ones I've been talking to we have been harping on getting back to the basic getting back to coming to church reading your Bible studying praying because if you can't do the small things you can forget algebra if you can't put one plus one together and get to church on Sunday we're gonna find out our greatest enemy is not the devil it's me my worst enemy I'll listen to me way too much come on somebody I listen to me way too much well let's listen to God every once in a while because he's the truth a minute and I will pray the father and he look God knew every bit of this yes so he put that provision in here that he would come to the Earth and say I'll pray the father and he'll give you another comforter that may abide with you forever what is it the spirit of Truth don't tell me the Holy Ghost has got error in it that same Holy Ghost is the one that said I am the way the truth and the life amen and then when he comes inside of you now listen we still have trouble we still got the spirit realm that we got to deal with but inside of your soul if you're born again today you're just as Eternal as God is you agree with every word that God said because you are God even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive that's why folks I'm telling you don't try to be odd you're just going to be odd the world's not going to understand us the world can't understand how that we strive to do the right thing to to to to speak I was at work the other day we were talking about something they were talking about cursing and and saying bad words and stuff of course they're all Baptists and and nothing so they're they're like well well I can't help it I is the first word they said I can't help it I said well neither can I and they said what I said I can't help it but there's one inside of me that's greater than the eye that shuts my mouth when he wants to say something don't tell me you ain't had an evil thought come on people and you really want to say it to somebody too ouch but that's true but you know what we've got that typos we've got that thing inside of us that spiritual Rudder that says don't do that don't do that and even when we do do something wrong it checks us up right then wait it says no right there take care of that right now and you know what we do we do like brother Dale says oh we sit there and we mulling around in our spirit realm memory region contraceptive imagination imagination and we say no I believe it was that person's fault because I really don't like them and you know what they probably don't like me that's why they said what they did that's why I said what I did that's why we said what each other did we start slinging mud at each other we'll get that in brotherly kind of so don't worry about that but we got to get the spirit of truth but Spirit of truth comes inside because the world will not receive you because it seeth him not see if who he doesn't see the spirit of Truth it sees you and you're supposed to be that born in the same person you're supposed to be that guy that can't you know help it when one little slips out my little XYZ slips out no not if you don't have that in you anymore so I said the unclean Spirit goes out out and we let him back in but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be inside of you John 15 26 says but when the comforter has come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth forth from the father look he shall testify of me that's why your life is a testimony your life brother Brown says speaks louder than your words John 17 17 says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth not mine his as thou has sent me into the world even so I have looked sent them into the world Listen Saint John 17 is The Lord's Prayer we can say Psalms is The Lord's Prayer that's okay but Psalm 17 verse 17 that hold John 17 is the Lord praying for me and you knowing that we would be just like Peter Peter I know Satan is going to sift you like sand he said but I prayed for you actress like David being an adulterer murderer premeditated murder and Nathan says David you're that man but what did he say but I have prayed for you we have Prophet pray for us that said that we would make it he showed us how to make it that's why God had to send us the prophet that shows how to make it because we don't know if we're making it over here we'll make it over here but we know that this message is true John 17 says sanctify them the only way you're going to get Sanctified is through the truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so I have also sent them so in other words we can't put ourselves in the bubble and say well I'm a Christian I'm just going to go sit in a cave Jesus said he sent us into the world he sent it why did he send us into the world why to show him look even so I have also sent them as you have sent me into the world what to Proclaim who God is I'm going to send my friend my people to Proclaim who God is and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through some truth that's not what it says truth be truth be true so there is a truth and there is the truth the truth is what we've been presented in the end time because God has given us a mandate to get out of here and we can't get out here on false Doctrine all right so third John 1 3 says fire Rejoice greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even so thou walketh because look I was thinking about this you take brother Brown back in the 60s and 50s and I was reading some of the um I was looking at the word medicine and I wrote way back in the 50s and he was talking about medicine and for another sermon sometime but look I Rejoice greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth now this is John John goes to Patmos and then he leaves Patmos and comes back to the what Believers of the church age brother Brown said he was the pastor of the first church age remember Paul was the prophet then he died and then John comes back from Patmos and lives to be about 96 years old and he becomes the pastor of that Ephesian Church everybody with me that's what the prophet of God said so that's what he done he come back and he's he's just Overjoyed that they're walking in truth if brother random could look over the portal of time today he might not have thought so much when he was in and he saw a lot of Pentecost he saw a lot of confusion but he knew there'd be a truth be true and that's who you and I this is the product of that and I pray that he's smiling today that he knows that his children and his Brethren are walking in truth I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in truth it would be no Greater Joy brother John for All My Children natural to be walking in truth amen so there's no Greater Joy for the natural or the spiritual to be walking in truth all right 1964 the token brother Brown said look do you believe that Jesus lives and Reigns today congregation says amen do you believe what I've told you is the truth amen it's the token the requirement I only can speak what is truth wow wow I only speak what I see what I hear what's revealed to me watch and why I say this of the tens of thousands and tens of thousands of times not one time has it ever failed to be true how in the world could we not could we deny that we had a prophet Among Us when Millions upon millions of times he used discernment to discern and it was not wrong one time I don't care if the 12 people didn't fall off the bridge I don't care if they said he was over here when he should have been over there listen to those tapes you listen to those tapes that is God Discerning the hearts of the people and that can't be error that's got to be the truth look he's in other words he said God if I told the truth you got to come on the same you got to come and help us and I'm saying today if we have God Among Us and we call out for God he's got to come on the same he's got to come and reveal his word to us he's got to come and give you whatever you want not one time has it ever fail listen I've never seen the word of God fail I've seen us fail I've seen me fail but I've never seen the word of God fail and that's why brother Brown says don't look at me I'm a man but that was God in a man that's like there's God in Me and You and he's going to use us he said now that has to be God that has to be God well would God give him Ministry now look at this would God give a Ministry like that to somebody that didn't know what they were talking about I don't think so either brother power without characters what satanic but Power with character if it's rule and when those people walked up in front of him and he'd give him that discernment that wasn't brother Adam how was God doing that was God speaking to us we truly have had the voice of God speak to us in the end time amen through a man and now he's speaking through men and women sisters brothers all of us as we proclaim the word of God not some Mis not some mystery not some some mythical something that we might believe one day and then it's going to fall tomorrow and you got to you know you got these that are elevated and then all wants to get the swaggers and all them they get elevated and all of a sudden you find out they ain't what they're supposed to be it's like everybody same way why would God give a Ministry like that to somebody that didn't know what they were talking about no congregation says would he identify himself as that Seer there and then turn around and give him a mixed up word he's telling the people I'm here to tell you the truth the guy that denies it is the one that's mixed up all these people is denying the message of the hour they're mixed up yes I'm not saying they're not born again I'm saying they're mixed up they've had their Eagle Eye filmed over but if it stays filmed over long enough they weren't Eagles to begin with amen it's the one that's mixed up and God ain't mixed up God is his own interpreter that's my brother Brown would stand on the platform he said if God don't come in other words I'm gonna make a mistake but if God comes he can't make a mistake so he could he could literally turn his body over to God and say all right I don't know what I said but it had to be the truth because it was him and they tell them the house number what color shoes they had on the day before where they were a week before this the doctor that looked at them the doctor had on glasses he had on a blue coat they got on a white coat I mean it's so detailed because he was looking at it because you know what God was there um let's listen that part of truth I hope we know what truth is I hope we're we're at least at least trying to understand what truth is and and know that the truth well what sets you free not behind you if you're bound today you don't have the truth if you're bound today you don't have all the truth everybody with me all right now there's some of us that are bound different ways you know I I'm I'm taking heart medicine I'm taking you know you look at that but now truth I'm not bounding the truth is truth that set me free and if I can just get into that it'll heal my diseases that's what the Bible says so the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses or five rather the Inside Man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscious love and so forth in other words memory reason Consciousness affects imagination then this outside guys see tastes feel smelling here but the inside of that spirit is a soul and that's controlled by one thing your free will yes your free will you can accept what the devil says or accept What God Says and that'll determine what spirit is in there wow if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God if it and it won't feed on anything of the world as brother Bob was talking about this morning how we we prepare we prepare ourselves you know they prepare themselves they're getting ready to play these big football games and all different things they're preparing yourself they're getting ready they're getting everything they need you know and all especially the ones that's going to be in the stands you know they're going to get their face paint out and they're going to get their raw raw pom-poms and all that stuff they go get all that ready did you read your Bible before you came to church this morning don't raise your hand make him better did you pray before you came to church did you pray to have a good service today no some of you didn't because the way you're looking at me listen it is a struggle to get to church especially if you got kids I'm talking about in the natural part it's just a struggle but aren't we supposed to be Overcomers aren't we supposed to be overcome that's what that's where we get our joy and that's where we get our peace and that's where we get our uh something from God when we've what when we've turned it over to him and let him take care of what's going on let him remind us to put gas in the car the day before and not have to stop and put gas and be late that will do that you know but you know what most times you because you forgot to do it like I said before you have some big operation or something the next day I'll guarantee you you're gonna go out to the car you're going to turn on you're gonna say I got enough gas or I don't run the convenience store all right so let's let's pray and read our Bible before we come to church let's prepare ourselves not like his brother Bob says it's just place to come it's just not just a place to come if you don't show up somebody's going to say anything about listen you know if you're living right or not so okay so memory reason conscious facts and Imagination that's what we're dealing with when we start in these virtues with faith virtue knowledge temporations Godless brotherly kindness and love which is not that affection we're looking at right there all right that affection is as we read before that's the affection you have for your children you have for your wife it's called filial love not agape love all right the agape love is agape love it's God's love all right everybody with me on that and that's what the Capstone is that's the love of God and you don't wait till you get up there when you get born again you have the love of God in your soul the only problem is it's kind of like getting married you learn to love each other you don't fall in love and you don't you know some of my people How You Gonna Take One Life and another life and hopefully you've stayed separate until you get married but then you've got these surprises because you've never lived Bob hush you've never you've never lived together I mean well if you live single even even if if somebody something was to happen to June or not or maybe vice versa and we live you know 20 years without a spouse then all of a sudden somebody comes up in your life and you're like no I don't do that for 20 years I've got up when I wanted to put on what I wanted to you want to do what see what but you got to learn to love all over again that's and that's natural down here but now with God's love if you really get the love of God you don't lose it you build on it you build on it you don't lose it you don't lose that and then down here we know that we lose some of that love and even now remember now what happened in the first church in the Book of Revelations it says you what lost your first love that was the love that what was put in the word of God by John and Peter and Paul the different ones the disciples they had lost that love that first love and it became what it became affection because I'm gonna tell you something a false Doctrine is not agape love because some people love their Doctrine I do I love mine I love my Doctrine but I believe it's the truth and they love theirs and believe it's the truth but when truth was presented to us what did we do with it did we kick it out or do we say well this is the truth amen something something's good about this all right we'll get to that a little bit more in um knowledge because you got to know for right for wrong you got to know whether the word's right you got to know whether I'm preaching to you just write today or preaching wrong or what Bob said today was right or wrong you you got to discern that all right and these virtues are exactly where they're supposed to be is everybody okay we're going to read this and then we'll probably not going to get diversity we'll get to it maybe this afternoon it's 11 43 now now inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the Breath of Life is breathed into him that spirit is what of a worldly nature so there's nothing about you Godly when you're born now listen for those of you that don't understand if a baby dies it goes to heaven why because there's nothing to count against it because it don't it can't make a choice thank God I was reading yesterday um where the um whooping cough we talk about the Spanish Flu whooping cough and all that that was in the 19 early 1920s 1900s it killed millions of kids and even dad's first four uh sisters I believe they didn't live past two or three months or a year or two because they got some kind of something that they're secure for now but and they died all of them are going to be in heaven we can't fathom that but but brother Brandon walks up and when he kind of goes across the curtain of time or has that dream and he says I see this pretty young ladies that young lady standing there and she says daddy don't you know who I am in other words it was Sharon Rose he only shot she died at six months old so she never but look in God's mind that woman developed to that age that's what she would have developed to because that was in the mind of God that's what she would have developed to if she'd lived him at 18 20 years old so thank God there's gonna be a lot of people in heaven there's gonna be a lot of people in heaven and how they all gonna fit ain't my business that's God's business not mine I just want to fit in that 1500 Mile Square City that's the only one I want to fit in that's my home that's my future home that's where I'm going to live not come in and out that's where I'm going to live because every born-again Christian is going to live in that City and you know what it's not 1600 it's 1500. he made it exactly the amount we needed to get the people in there he gave Noah the exact dimensions to put eight people and several animals in that art and no more right so God knows best the spirit of awareness of a worldly nature because what it was not given from God but it was permitted by God because God's the only one can give you breath he's the only one can give it to you and he's the only one who can take it away from you all right so that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God it was permitted by God and then that permission lasts until the age of accountability you guys when you have free will 12 13 14 whatever and that's up to the person brother Brown says when the person knows right from wrong well now we know that as a little kid too but when you get up to a place where you really that's why even even man has set forth rules you know you can only drive when you're 16. it should be 20. and the older one says amen but now let me get the older people there's a time when y'all don't be driving either oh hello somebody huh I got everybody learn that but the law sets that you can that you can vote at this certain age because you can make a rational decision you know you got to be whatever it is 20 or 21 to drink so you make the right you're not an adult you can't make a rational decision until this age well God's the same way he knows you can't make a rational decision until you get to this age then you what discern right from wrong and then what you got a choice you got to make amen now you get that for every child that's born in the world is born in sin shaping liquid come to the world speaking lies that's right so that person inside there is a center to begin with now it's got five inlets and those five inlets we know whether I can call them or not and this memory reason conscious facts and Imagination there's five elements to the spirit you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculty at all this thing it's all from it all it all just does it emulates from the inside what the inside says do I move my hands all right your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit wow you have to think with your spirit wow you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reasoning don't see taste feel smelling here reason is what you make up in your mind so we got a reason today whether the word the Bible tells us to come and reason together but then the Bible says cast down reasoning so we have to understand what they're saying come let us reason together is to come and talk about truth David all right talk about truth but you have to reason you can't reason with your physical body or your physical being because reason doesn't see taste feel smelling here reason is what you can make you make in your mind if you're a sleeper you're not your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason and five senses that controls that man now the last man that's what I want to talk about before we close the last man which is the soul there's only one sense faith it out that's it Factor it out free moral agency will choose are to reject it all right everybody with me on that let's read this real quick he's talking about the brass serpent it wasn't in the brass serpent it wasn't in the material that made the brass Circle wasn't in the material this is material that holds you together all right though though no thou knowest there's no virtue in any man we'll talk about in a minute but that virtue has to your the man has to give it an outlet it has to have an outlet to go out of like Jesus was standing on the earth and uh the Centurion said I know you're a man of of great Authority all right same way with Peter Peter said look on us Silver and Gold Have I None what that was virtue inside of them but it what he he calls it in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk not in the name of Peter or Paul or William Branham there's no virtue in the serpent nor in the brass that was made out of or the pole The Virtue was doing what God Said do as Bob said come to church would be the first thing for you to start on that's all you look at Bob sometimes and Bob knows it's it's beating up against some people and you look in his eyes bless him [Laughter] because he can say I know you could people are just not their head and praise the Lord and don't come to church for three weeks some people touch the Garment of Jesus that's the ones that do this all the time you know some people touch the Garment of Jesus and was made well others smacked him in the face and hit him in the head look it's the approach it's the approach that you make when I approached this Pulpit I don't approach it as just whatever this is the place that God is supposed to meet all of us not just one person and it's correction and it's a place to get help it's a place to get nourishment if you believe it if you believe it if thou cans believe brother Brown says all things are possible all right hit him in the head some people hit him in the head with sticks and spit in his face he never felt any virtue at all they were beaten up the Lord Jesus that was the most virtuous person that lived on the face of the Earth and they couldn't feel nothing but hatred because of what was inside of them they felt hatred same thing with me and you folks I'm telling you when it comes down to the squeeze people are going to hate you thinking they're doing God a service they're going to beat you maybe even try to kill you thinking they're doing God that's in the Bible thinking they're doing God a service not thinking they're just drunk they're going to run you off the road and kill you no no they think they're doing the right thing look 68 million Christians were killed in the Dark Ages by who Christians suppose what killed by the world it was Crusades of Christians so-called men dirty people it was their attitude of approach we'll stop right here magicians get ready to come it depends on what attitude you come in if you come believing that you're coming to get help and you're confident that you're coming to the right person Jesus Christ and you're coming his provided way of approach you're going to receive something if you come reverently that's why I mean you may think it's silly or not but when we prayed last night I didn't want nothing going on downstairs I didn't want nothing going on in the sanctuary I didn't want to stand around hollering and talking that's not what it was for last night last night was for you to talk to God in the quietness of this whole building everything quiet all right well I'll touch and see if you come say well I'll go touch him and see if it helps me see if it helps me that won't do any good it's your approach to God's Divine article is what does it just like the brass serpent musicians come on just like the brown serpent the serpent didn't have any virtue it was a piece of brass look this is a piece of Flesh you live in a piece of Flesh brother Branham was a piece of Flesh everybody with me but God told us he was going to use those pieces of Flesh to defeat the Devil with neither did Paul have any virtue in it not a bit but it was obeying what God Said do yes what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God obedience to the word of God let me read this real quick everybody stand we'll start reading out of the Statue of perfect man this afternoon brother Brown said look we're not building an organization we're not building a Branham organization or or or putting him as the head Christ is our head peace part of it I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build what individuals individuals to the what stature of Jesus Christ that they might be come on somebody that power has now been transferred that they might be the PowerHouse and Dwelling Place of the Spirit by his work by his words he built up the individual to that place now build an organization to a greater denomination but Bill the individual the Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea add to your faith first you you your verse your knowledge well now you're coming to a place and we'll talk about it this afternoon let's sing a song God bless you this thing right here is nothing it's what's inside what's inside of you hey [Music] oh there's a River of Life [Music] [Applause] going out [Music] open prison doors [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign goes to a out in the woods and he finds this little stream coming there's one on my route and I think about it all the time it's right on side of the road on my on my mail route and it's just water coming up out of the ground there's a little bitty like a Ledge and boy when it rains it's like a river but when it doesn't rain and it hasn't rained for months there's still a little trickle coming out and it makes a little stream about that wine so it doesn't ever stop but I thought brother round said well said spring if you could talk so you come out of that ground for the deer no even though the deer do get nourishment out of my water so while you come out of the ground because of the squirrels or the rabbits or whatever you know he said no that's not it brother mom said I'd say well well spring why why are you why is that are you coming out of the ground in an odd way because Springs are kind of odd they come out of the ground where you don't see a river running you know it just comes up out of the ground he said if that spring could talk it says there's something inside of me the only way that spring can come out of that ground because what what is a spring is utter this down in down in ground you hadn't dig a whale you hadn't dug a well so it can come up through so you can get your water no it's pressure and it's found a little crack it's found a little bit of something and it just keeps pushing and all of a sudden it breaks out and it starts running [Music] what is it it's something inside it's the pressure from the inside it's what pushes that spring out and then the deer can drink and then the rabbits can drink and then the men can drink oh there's a River of Life flowing out from me [Music] doors [Music] [Music] and give to me that life is [Music] [Applause] [Music]
