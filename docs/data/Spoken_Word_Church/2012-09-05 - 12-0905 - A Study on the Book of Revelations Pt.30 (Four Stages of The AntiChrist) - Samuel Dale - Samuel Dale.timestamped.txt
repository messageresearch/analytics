[7:42] over to Revelation
[7:46] 6 don't forget first Peter now there
[7:49] we're talking about at the revelation of
[7:51] Jesus Christ all right keep that in your
[7:54] mind so what Revelations 1:1 the
[7:57] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[7:58] gave un to him to show sh unto his
[8:01] servants things which must shortly come
[8:03] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[8:06] his Angel unto his servant John who bear
[8:08] record of the word of God and of the
[8:10] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[8:12] things that he saw blessed is he that
[8:14] readeth and they that hear the words of
[8:16] this prophecy and keep those things
[8:19] which are written therein for the time
[8:22] is at hand and all right now Revelations
[8:28] 6
[8:31] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[8:32] the seals and I heard as it were the
[8:35] noise of Thunder one of the four Beast
[8:38] saying now as it were a was a were the
[8:41] voice of Thunder what he heard so he was
[8:44] what one of the four beasts saying come
[8:47] and see and I saw and behold a white
[8:50] horse and he that sat on him had a bow
[8:52] and a crown was given unto him and he
[8:55] went forth conquering and to conquer you
[8:58] may be seated the Lord add His blessings
[9:00] to the reading of the word now I know
[9:03] tonight's going to be almost a uh
[9:07] complete repeat of Sunday Services the
[9:10] afternoon and I I regret that uh Paul
[9:14] said it was needful sometimes to say
[9:16] things again and I I must believe that
[9:19] but I regret that uh you know I I well
[9:24] forget it cuz I'm going to do it
[9:26] anyway I'm going to go back over it
[9:28] again amen so apologize I won't do no
[9:30] good but uh I'm not going to do I'm
[9:32] going to try to settle down and more
[9:34] less Sunday I was just preached the
[9:36] cross and didn't use my notes I never
[9:38] did turn a page and I just kind of run
[9:40] through a line of what I wanted you to
[9:43] see and then tonight we'll just back up
[9:47] and you know put everything slow and
[9:50] gradual and you know bringing forth the
[9:53] the things that we believe about these
[9:55] things all right now we've been quite
[9:59] while speaking about in in the study of
[10:02] the Book of
[10:03] Revelations uh this is message number 30
[10:06] and what I want you to think of tonight
[10:08] is so now you're going to have to bear
[10:10] with me then and even the quote you read
[10:14] bear with me when the prophet will say
[10:17] three
[10:18] stages and you'll go through it
[10:21] Antichrist Prophet you know and then
[10:24] he'll go to Beast all right but then no
[10:29] you got to have the number four for the
[10:32] Antichrist and we'll get through that at
[10:34] the light of the message so now I want
[10:36] to us to go through it and I want you to
[10:39] think about it and we will read that
[10:40] after a while let see you got four
[10:44] stages this uh one that we're talking
[10:47] about here the what we read in the
[10:50] Revelation
[10:54] 61 you see a white
[10:57] horse and he
[11:00] right that
[11:02] set on him y all right
[11:07] now that's he is a
[11:10] person all right amen but what we've got
[11:13] to do is to see how it can come out to
[11:16] be that
[11:17] person all right and and then that way
[11:20] you'll catch on to why we're talking
[11:22] about four stages because then you'll
[11:24] see that it starts out uh Antichrist
[11:27] Spirit the among the church we'll cover
[11:30] that and then it'll come into the next
[11:33] stage see which was the first one with a
[11:36] white horse White Horse the next one is
[11:39] a red horse and you'll see that it turns
[11:43] out to be a pope y you know but yet he's
[11:48] not in the stage of Pope yet he will
[11:51] begin as a prophet a false prophet to a
[11:55] false system right and then he'll become
[11:58] incarnate
[12:02] in the prophet and come out to be one
[12:05] man which will be a pope then all right
[12:07] then see that Pope is still not the
[12:10] quote man of sin sitting in the temple
[12:14] of God showing himself to be as God as
[12:16] we'll read because that will wind up to
[12:19] be the Beast right amen all right so you
[12:22] got a white horse and you're going to
[12:24] have the second seal will be a red horse
[12:26] third seal will be a black horse fourth
[12:28] seal he be a Pale Horse amen it's the
[12:30] same horse just different colors
[12:33] different stages of his journey amen and
[12:36] it's the same Rider on each
[12:38] horse all right he just gets off one and
[12:41] goes on and on and on just keeps going
[12:43] but there's four stages of him and that
[12:46] way it'll fit them to understand why
[12:49] there has to be four combat
[12:52] Beast the lion the ox the man the
[12:55] eagle to combat the an to Christ you
[13:00] know but now I don't know where if youve
[13:02] thought about it in that form or not see
[13:04] when brother Rand said in the the seal
[13:07] book he said you want me to tell you who
[13:08] this is no matter what I was right he
[13:10] said it's the
[13:12] Antichrist well you just look out and
[13:15] say
[13:16] Antichrist
[13:18] well John said the Antichrist was
[13:21] already with you
[13:25] right now but what was John looking at a
[13:31] man or a spirit right
[13:34] amen and that's why Paul if it had been
[13:37] a
[13:38] man standing there Crown you know a
[13:41] crown was given unto him later see if it
[13:44] had been that then Paul easily would
[13:46] have known what the Antichrist was and
[13:50] he would have called it that see cuz he
[13:53] would have seen a man but instead he saw
[13:55] a spirit among the people and and he
[13:58] began to tell you know about the things
[14:00] that that Spirit Among Us would lead us
[14:02] away from the word you know and the
[14:04] things and and carry it in and then he
[14:07] would speak of the man of sin amen that
[14:11] would be sitting in the temple of God in
[14:12] Thessalonians there show himself to be
[14:15] as God see that's when he would become
[14:18] the Beast right Satan
[14:21] incarnate
[14:24] in the false prophet right that had
[14:28] wound up to be Pope y that it started as
[14:30] an antichrist Spirit right so now we're
[14:33] going to get to that in the message in a
[14:35] little bit but I I kept saying some
[14:37] things and I have for years and and I
[14:40] come back to it all the time
[14:43] so if it's for me okay you bear with me
[14:46] till I get it off of my heart and I
[14:48] surely haveen had it on my heart for 40
[14:50] years to try to look at the
[14:53] Bible and see
[14:57] that this message Mage doesn't reveal
[14:59] the
[15:00] devil right right this enti message that
[15:03] we claim it doesn't reveal the devil
[15:06] that's right it reveals Jesus Christ
[15:08] amen the Bible doesn't reveal the devil
[15:13] right there is no devil to be I mean
[15:16] there there's nothing about him you got
[15:17] to have something for it to be reveal
[15:20] you know he will be annihilated one day
[15:22] well what about your Revelation right
[15:24] amen that's right you agree that's right
[15:27] the Beast to FAL Prophet Etc will be
[15:30] cast into the Lake of Fire and totally
[15:32] annihilated right amen all right now it
[15:35] can't be a
[15:36] revelation
[15:39] M cuz Revelation can never be
[15:41] annihilated right you know true
[15:43] Revelation right man now if it's a part
[15:46] Revelation or just thoughts it ain't got
[15:49] no Foundation to it
[15:51] anyway that's why hell is hell has no
[15:55] Foundation that's right amen see it was
[15:58] was created for the devil and his angels
[16:01] right but one day death and hell will be
[16:04] cast into the Lake of Fire right and
[16:07] totally annihilated that's right right
[16:09] see because it has no Foundation amen
[16:12] all
[16:13] right see in that way that's why we
[16:16] don't believe in the eternal hell right
[16:19] because if hell is eternal You' have to
[16:21] have eternal life right that's easy to
[16:23] take isn't it amen you'd have to have
[16:25] eternal life well that would be God's
[16:27] own life living in hell but see we've
[16:29] been taught that all our life
[16:31] right and like I tell you it it ain't
[16:34] going to change nobody's thinking for me
[16:36] to say that right right I don't know how
[16:39] many is listening tonight around the
[16:40] world even live or will be listening to
[16:43] Tes but you know I know and realize that
[16:46] I can't reveal anything to you that's
[16:48] right and I know and realize that
[16:49] brother random cannot reveal anything to
[16:51] you even the Lord Jesus said my own life
[16:55] did not reveal that he said it takes a
[16:57] Holy Spirit to reveal but if God don't
[17:00] reveal to you the things I'm talking
[17:02] about you don't know what I'm talking
[17:04] about amen right it's words right but
[17:10] it's not a revelation then it's
[17:13] revealed right you follow what I'm
[17:15] saying amen so Satan can't be the
[17:19] Revelation that the Bible is talking
[17:22] about he is not the first
[17:25] seal the holy spirit is the Seal of God
[17:28] according to Ephesians 4:30 right and
[17:31] the Holy Spirit is the only one that can
[17:32] break the seal right
[17:35] amen see that's what I've tried for all
[17:37] of the 40 years or more now to get you
[17:40] to see the seals is they don't reveal
[17:42] the Antichrist am the
[17:44] things they reveal Jesus
[17:48] Christ all right then the opposition is
[17:53] seen right on the other side to amen and
[17:58] brother was making a statement one day I
[17:59] looked for it there's a word also when I
[18:01] couldn't find it maybe you can one day
[18:03] but maybe way can remember it but
[18:05] brother Brown said we've talked enough
[18:07] about him yeah that's right he was
[18:11] talking about the devil and his ways he
[18:13] said we've talked enough about him right
[18:16] amen that's true he said we'll get on to
[18:19] the revelation of Jesus Christ in other
[18:22] words so I gave you a lot of the quotes
[18:24] back that I had given you Sunday for the
[18:27] purpose
[18:28] of you following it with
[18:31] me and then we'll get down to the real
[18:34] part of the message you know and I don't
[18:36] bother me to continue it that's right
[18:38] next Wednesday CU brother brother prash
[18:41] his son Samuel will be with us this
[18:45] coming weekend the Lord willing to
[18:46] preach for us and just pray that the
[18:48] Lord would bless him amen bless us as we
[18:51] travel and go and come back all right
[18:55] now the revelation of Jesus Christ
[19:00] we read that in Revelations 1 we read it
[19:02] we've read it we read it we read it
[19:05] right right ever service for 29 this is
[19:08] number 30 and it starts off the
[19:11] revelation of Jesus Christ amen all
[19:15] right now we've been into Peter using at
[19:19] the revelation of Jesus
[19:21] Christ brother brandom used the the
[19:24] quote revelation of Jesus Christ 10 57
[19:31] times 85 of those times were used before
[19:35] the seals broke up to that period and 72
[19:40] times in the seal book and coming
[19:43] thereafter so you know for certain that
[19:46] he believed in the revelation of Jesus
[19:48] Christ right amen and that's what I want
[19:49] us to do now tonight is just read and
[19:53] then we'll get through this part and if
[19:54] we don't cover it we'll get back to it
[19:56] later it's all right I want to make make
[19:58] sure you you get it then you say to most
[20:02] people you know watch the first seal by
[20:04] horse rider
[20:06] yeah no the first seal is a revelation
[20:10] of Jesus Christ amen right amen the
[20:13] white horse rider is going the other way
[20:15] I ask you to read the seal book I don't
[20:17] want to raise a hands of how many did
[20:19] you know the what the first
[20:22] seal
[20:24] right but notice what he'll say about
[20:26] that fellow right that
[20:29] guy that person riding
[20:33] off and if you got two people in the
[20:35] Bible standing
[20:37] there yeah you certainly don't have a
[20:40] revelation of God right one of them is
[20:42] God and the other the devil or both of
[20:44] them is a devil you know cuz God can't
[20:47] be divided up no all right now but let's
[20:51] read a few quotes and we'll just go
[20:53] quote quote quote quote quote I'll give
[20:55] them and the brothers can pull them as
[20:57] fast as they can and we'll read them off
[20:59] to you so go ahead and start with number
[21:01] one brother says the evening me
[21:04] messenger 63
[21:09] 11:16 you and always that every time
[21:11] that a messenger comes it's always a
[21:13] call back to the word y never fails
[21:15] remember this is the complete revelation
[21:18] of Jesus Christ there cannot be nothing
[21:21] added to it or taken from it it's the
[21:23] complete revelation of Jesus Christ and
[21:26] the only way that we can ever be sure if
[21:29] anything Rises Among Us that's contrary
[21:32] to this Revelation then it's wrong see
[21:36] it's the back of the word and always
[21:38] calling it's back to the word always
[21:41] calling back right awaking Jesus
[21:44] paragraph
[21:45] 4763 117 it's the word God's program the
[21:49] complete revelation of what he was what
[21:52] he is and what he will be it's a
[21:55] continual revelation of Jesus Jesus
[21:58] Christ and a complete revelation of
[22:01] Jesus Christ is the Bible anything
[22:04] contrary to him we going to get rid of
[22:06] it right all right number
[22:10] three paragraph 16 of the breach 63 317
[22:15] evening and this book let's turn now to
[22:17] the fifth chapter of the book which is
[22:19] called the revelation of Jesus
[22:23] Christ first seal paragraph 12 6338
[22:28] 18 and as we study this chapter we're
[22:31] referring to referring different places
[22:33] even to Old and New Testament alike
[22:36] what's Old and New Testament because the
[22:39] entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus
[22:42] Christ see that's all together the
[22:44] revelation of of the the Lord Jesus the
[22:47] revelation of Jesus Christ is God

[31:45] the hire the dress the clothes the men
[31:48] the the the shorts and the hire the Long
[31:50] hire andever it'll take care of

[32:54] Paul now come on folks brother Bram was
[32:58] preaching to a world right when he had
[33:01] to preach hiring clothes and dress in
[33:03] every service he was trying to get
[33:05] people converted right that thought they
[33:08] were converted
[33:10] yeah that's right right that's right and
[33:13] you know that's the hardest person to
[33:14] talk to yep absolutely correct you get
[33:17] somebody says I ain't wrong you ain't
[33:19] going to do anything you want to you
[33:21] ain't going to convince them right
[33:24] that's right the person said I ain't
[33:26] wrong with you W shut up forget it y
[33:29] right they're not going to listen to you
[33:33] right like the old saying is about an
[33:35] alcoholic is what you got to First admit
[33:38] you
[33:39] one then you can be helped
[33:45] MH you go down to the inum and they ask
[33:49] you a question they said do you think
[33:50] you're crazy and you no I ain't no I
[33:52] ain't crazy lock him up over
[33:54] there you say well I probably am cuz
[33:58] sometimes I act like I am they say put
[33:59] them over this side and we help that
[34:01] fell that's just about a truth of it
[34:04] right right but listen
[34:08] Church the seals then don't reveal the
[34:11] Antichrist amen right and the actual
[34:14] opening of that seal then is not until
[34:18] we get out of here right and we'll be to
[34:20] Israel when that man of sin when we get
[34:23] to him after a while if we don't we'll
[34:24] take it later when he stands in that
[34:26] temple of God showing himself to be as
[34:28] God as the Beast
[34:31] right
[34:32] then there is your first
[34:36] seal completely made known
[34:40] right he said what what the prophet
[34:43] preached the seals to us yeah he
[34:45] preached one God he preached what a
[34:47] baptism he preached no eternal hell he
[34:48] preached a lot of things to us didn't he
[34:54] right yep
[34:57] and he preached what the seals really
[34:59] are amen it's a revelation of Jesus
[35:02] Christ that's
[35:05] right it's not revealing the Antichrist
[35:08] I certainly don't want to be there when
[35:09] that for seal opens at Armageddon do you
[35:13] right how about
[35:15] the fifth one right you want to be a Jew
[35:18] and be over there right now being
[35:19] slaughtered like
[35:22] crazy and I believe those Jews are still
[35:24] being killed and placed under the altar
[35:27] right until we get out of here
[35:31] sure you want to be here when the SE six
[35:33] seal breaks that's the tribulation
[35:38] period And in the seventh when it'll
[35:40] finally become the end of all things
[35:44] y see we get to Revelation Church amen
[35:48] right right we're his wife right then he
[35:51] shows us like we're going to try to do
[35:53] tonight he shows us and says this is the
[35:56] the
[36:01] Antichrist well if it's a spirit it
[36:04] can't be all of Revelations 1 I mean 61
[36:09] and 2 right go it there's a man there
[36:12] right sitting on a horse
[36:16] right it's only a spirit to start with
[36:19] right
[36:22] M you can't Crown a
[36:25] spirit he had to become a false prophet
[36:29] right he didn't Crown the false prophet
[36:32] when he first come out cuz there were
[36:35] many false prophets
[36:37] right it's like John says we're going to
[36:39] read over again the Antichrist is with
[36:42] us he said
[36:44] mhm you see they couldn't you couldn't
[36:46] Crown it till he become a pope right
[36:48] that was his crown that was when he was
[36:51] crowned when he become a
[36:55] pop and then he'll be the beast when we
[36:58] leave out of here that's the Antichrist
[37:00] right he's in four stages right that's
[37:04] what we must understand those stages all
[37:06] right we the bride of Christ can see
[37:09] what begins right and what ends
[37:14] right you remember Sunday when I was
[37:16] trying to make the point just preaching
[37:17] on it the brother around and said ever
[37:20] Spirit ever Doctrine started in Genesis
[37:23] absolutely amen right right amen amen
[37:27] all
[37:28] right then we got to go back there and
[37:30] find it but by being the bride of
[37:34] Christ we can see the beginning and the
[37:37] ending of all things amen we already
[37:40] know how the Millennium is going to be
[37:42] right amen and who it's going to be to
[37:45] right to the
[37:46] Jews we already know about the white
[37:49] Throne judgment and how that we sit on
[37:52] that throne with him
[37:54] amen we already know
[37:57] how the future home is going to be amen
[38:02] MH we certainly not there
[38:05] yet but see it's made known to
[38:09] us right and that is what I just quoted
[38:12] all these qu that is the revelation of
[38:14] Jesus
[38:17] Christ as we read that said the
[38:21] old as well as the new
[38:25] right he said if you can't see Christ in
[38:28] every verse of the Bible go back and
[38:29] read it again
[38:31] amen said you missed
[38:36] something he Hebrews
[38:39] 13:8 that didn't start on the day of
[38:42] Pentecost you know or starting the life
[38:44] of of Jesus Christ that started at the
[38:47] foundation of the world right amen
[38:49] that's right Hebrews 13:8 same yesterday
[38:53] today and forever was it not that that
[38:56] brother randam said eve failed on right
[39:00] right do you need that quote Eve failed
[39:03] on Hebrews
[39:05] 138 well what do you mean Jesus wouldn't
[39:08] e back
[39:09] her no but Christ would amen right amen
[39:14] and that's why brother R didn't say
[39:16] Jesus the same yesterday today and
[39:17] forever the Bible don't say it it says
[39:20] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[39:22] and
[39:23] amen
[39:25] amen see so we got it in the right order
[39:29] all right amen but just think of these
[39:31] things all now go ahead and pull up
[39:33] we're going to pull up a quote that I
[39:35] used our Sunday but it be later on over
[39:37] in your quote so this one going to be
[39:40] 15a P that one up and then we'll read
[39:42] the
[39:46] scriptures you got it on your notes s
[39:48] but look what he to say and I just pull
[39:50] this in to where we get it this is taken
[39:52] from the first seal U paragraph 293 and
[39:56] white horse rider went out who is he
[39:59] he's Mighty in his conquering
[40:01] power it is a great fellow in his
[40:05] conquering power you want me to tell you
[40:08] who he
[40:10] is he's the
[40:12] Antichrist that's exactly who he
[40:15] is now because you see if an antichrist
[40:20] Jesus said that the two would be so
[40:22] close together until it would deceive
[40:25] the very elected
[40:27] the Bible if it were possible Antichrist
[40:30] it's the Antichrist Spirit right all
[40:35] right now so he didn't start out back
[40:40] there he didn't start out back there if
[40:43] I missed something Reading go ahead you
[40:45] got 15a on here 10 a on that one 15 a
[40:49] what they're looking for well that's 10
[40:51] A's I told him to pull up after 10 okay
[40:55] keep my numbers right they right there
[40:56] running there 108 we just changed that
[40:59] while go you want to see us what was in
[41:01] there go our life like everything
[41:04] Richard had Joe and him doing one thing
[41:07] Wade had him doing another thing and I
[41:09] had him doing another thing and they was
[41:14] going all the same time they did it all
[41:17] he's really got a good mind I have to
[41:19] admit that that's right you know him and
[41:21] brother Anderson trying to hold us
[41:23] together see all right but go ahead now
[41:26] pull the scripture so let's read them
[41:27] again now who is this who is this white
[41:29] horse
[41:33] rider he's the Antichrist
[41:38] amen now we the
[41:41] bride not the
[41:44] world we the bride are going to see him
[41:49] as he starts as a
[41:51] spirit and then he becomes a prophet to
[41:54] that system and preaches his Doctrine
[41:58] and then he becomes an
[42:01] incarnate false
[42:07] prophet which is the
[42:09] pope and then he becomes the
[42:14] Beast which is a man of sin sitting in
[42:16] the temple of God showing himself to be
[42:17] as God then you better remember what the
[42:20] first seal
[42:22] says it says that he that set there on
[42:27] a
[42:28] man
[42:32] right second Thessalonians says the man
[42:35] of sin didn't say the baby of sin right
[42:39] the man of sin and they asked brother
[42:42] random we got it in here did that
[42:44] fulfill the first ceiling he says
[42:48] yes
[42:51] listen we see all of this by Revelation
[42:54] right in other wonderful thing Amen to
[42:58] be able to see the
[43:00] end and all things and can know all
[43:02] that's going to take place who would
[43:04] want to be anything else right it'd be a
[43:06] slanderous thing to go try to get me to
[43:08] run for president of the United States
[43:09] that's right you think I'd give up my
[43:11] office right
[43:13] here to be a president of this garbage
[43:15] Camp that's right well you could get up
[43:18] there and teach them the
[43:21] seals come on I can't even give them to
[43:25] the people of this message
[43:28] amen they don't want to hear them right
[43:31] of what they really are
[43:34] right and bring it down to where you sit
[43:37] your own life
[43:39] right now remember your Prophet said
[43:41] there a minute ago he said it would
[43:43] deceive the very elect if it was
[43:44] possible you want this quote he say as a
[43:47] matter of fact it would get them Tangled
[43:49] Up and he'd have to cut the work short
[43:52] you want that
[43:53] quote Oh no brother Dale
[43:56] I've got the quote where the Prophet
[43:58] said we can't be deceived I didn't say
[44:01] we'd be deceived I said he said we get
[44:04] tangled up
[44:07] right what he said you need to quote we
[44:10] can find it n brother Joe probably run
[44:12] off while I'm preaching bring out
[44:16] here
[44:18] listen
[44:20] John as I said
[44:23] Sunday was chosen to go to patas mhm
[44:26] M now Paul wasn't chosen
[44:32] right
[44:35] right you don't think like Paul was a
[44:37] prophet right right but you know he
[44:39] wasn't chosen to go right man well no he
[44:43] no come on if you got any sense at all
[44:45] go back and look up the ages and the
[44:46] times and the people Paul was already
[44:49] dead right before John went to patas
[44:51] right
[44:54] y he was
[44:57] the first church age started about ad 53
[45:00] I think it is John went to patas on ad
[45:03] 9596 or somewhere along in there 93 95
[45:06] or
[45:07] something Paul had done come and brought
[45:09] his message and been killed why wouldn't
[45:12] Paul chosen to go amen
[45:19] right he's part of the bride and was
[45:23] part of that beast but
[45:27] John
[45:29] represented the life
[45:32] Beast right remember brother said
[45:36] Matthew Mark Luke John Matthew he said
[45:40] was the
[45:41] line Ox was
[45:43] Mark Luke was the man John was the
[45:50] eagle as great as Paul was he was not
[45:53] chosen for that place because John
[45:56] represented the prophetic part and would
[45:58] tie together because it would have to
[46:00] been said then Matthew Mark Luke and
[46:04] Paul that's s run around would have had
[46:06] to explain
[46:08] it and he wouldn't have had his gospels
[46:11] correct
[46:13] right come on folks that's good is it
[46:17] time to wake up that's good so John was
[46:20] chosen y why because Jesus said there
[46:22] one of these standing here yep Paul was
[46:26] that's right so it couldn't been him but
[46:28] he said one of you standing here not
[46:29] going to die do you see me returning yep
[46:32] right yeah John was taken to patmas to
[46:34] see that a Sayan went out that John
[46:37] wouldn't going to die read that in the
[46:39] Bible a Sayan Went Out Among the
[46:41] apostles you think we get confused and
[46:43] get it all twisted up it went out there
[46:46] before Jesus ever left yeah that's right
[46:49] MH see John a't going to die y he said
[46:51] how about how be it he didn't say that y
[46:55] right
[46:56] but you see
[46:58] church that Antichrist Spirit has got us
[47:01] deceived
[47:07] right he said no don't me but bless God
[47:10] I'm in the
[47:11] truth well what are you blessing God and
[47:13] throw your shoulders back for yeah
[47:16] right you're sure there's something
[47:18] wrong with you right amen you said
[47:21] brother brand said brother brand that
[47:23] Antichrist Spirit got you to exce he'd
[47:24] say yes it's your
[47:26] and I'm trying my best to get rid of it
[47:28] get of it
[47:30] amen that's
[47:32] right but you see we think we struck we
[47:35] we know all about it ain't no Antichrist
[47:38] going to deceive me no it ain't going to
[47:40] deceive it's already got
[47:43] you brother R said it was so close yeah
[47:46] right remember you say it's anointings
[47:48] in time remember brother brand
[47:53] said Lucifer was the anointed sh that
[47:56] Stood Beside the Lord and the Bible says
[47:59] it Y and brother R said that even
[48:02] Lucifer could pass out Supernatural
[48:04] gifts absolutely absolutely you need
[48:07] that quote he could pass out
[48:09] Supernatural gifts sure you
[48:13] can there's only one way you can tell
[48:15] which one's right and which one's wrong
[48:17] and that's by the
[48:19] word that's right you can't tell it by
[48:22] your feelings that's right that's right
[48:25] so you take gifts and you their gifts
[48:27] will get in your
[48:29] way god-given gifts will get in your way
[48:32] you know why because you'll lean to them
[48:35] all the time instead of depending upon
[48:37] the word and letting the gift operate
[48:39] right right and then thank God for the
[48:41] gift you'll start trying to use the gift
[48:43] to interpret the word yeah and it won't
[48:46] work nope the devil's got you in his
[48:49] trap that's
[48:50] right would you see church that's why
[48:52] I'm not
[48:54] popular I believe in gifts I believe in
[48:58] in the workings of the Holy Spirit am it
[49:00] but I believe in the word right being
[49:03] revealed and then I can know whether
[49:05] it's the right Spirit or not right right
[49:08] oh the the it was so sweet and humble it
[49:11] come to
[49:13] me do you think the devil's going to
[49:15] come to you like a roaring
[49:18] line and say I'm the
[49:21] devil
[49:22] no he's going to be soft and smooth
[49:25] smothing smoothing but you know what God
[49:28] sometimes you know what he does he said
[49:30] sit down shut
[49:33] up and goes Pap out slaps us a few times

[50:38] NAA you better go read your prophet's
[50:41] message
[50:43] okay and the best you can get out of
[50:45] reading it is that they went down there
[50:47] found out it was wrong in left but
[50:49] brother R said they brought back
[50:50] doctrines with them sure because their
[50:53] seed was planted y
[50:56] you better read the whole message y amen
[50:58] that's right well we can't be dece no

[51:10] don't compare with revelation of Jesus
[51:12] Christ is what you got that's right
[51:14] there people in this message got
[51:15] Thunders and virt and and all kind of
[51:17] things and they're the great prophet of
[51:19] this that was sold over here and they're
[51:21] all kind of doing polygamy all kind of
[51:23] doing young kids running men with young
[51:26] girls
[51:32] yeah in this
[51:35] message yeah right sometimes I'm
[51:37] embarrassed to be a part of it
[51:41] amen but I know that if I'm going to try
[51:43] to stand for the truth I got to be a
[51:45] part of it cuz this message was the
[51:47] truth that's right it didn't bring none
[51:49] of them some of us were talking the
[51:50] other day about I think it was brother
[51:52] Samson when we was
[51:54] talking
[51:55] he made a good point he said a good
[51:57] denominational Church ain't going to
[51:58] fall for what the people of this message
[52:00] fall
[52:01] for you can't get that in a Baptist
[52:04] Church yeah and preach what's in this
[52:07] message they'll throw you out of it
[52:10] that's right even as bad as they've got
[52:13] yeah that's
[52:14] true when when I was there it was pretty
[52:20] tough you didn't have no double married
[52:22] preachers right in the Baptist Church
[52:24] when I was
[52:26] there that's right they wouldn't let him
[52:32] preach That's How Strong they
[52:35] were come on church right but listen so
[52:40] when brother ROM is
[52:44] saying that this is the oh you want me
[52:46] to know who tell you who it is he said
[52:48] it's the Antichrist yeah then he
[52:50] proceeds starts out trying to tell you
[52:52] and I you know
[52:55] how that it starts is a
[52:57] spirit
[52:59] right a
[53:01] saying a little
[53:06] thought and like I told you Sunday what
[53:09] killed
[53:12] Abel because
[53:15] can Doctrine
[53:18] yep we get on to the second sea over
[53:20] that in the Red Sea the doctrine killed
[53:23] him amen
[53:25] Cain got to the point that you've heard
[53:27] brother Brown say it he said God this is
[53:30] my offering you take it or leave it
[53:34] yeah and brother Brown said how could
[53:36] anybody under any anointing stand in the
[53:39] presence of God and talk like them
[53:41] things right amen that was how deceiving
[53:45] it was
[53:46] Amen brother R say this under and we'll
[53:49] get in a minute the symbol of under a
[53:51] symbol of a white righteous church right
[53:53] yes sir feeding the the world taking the
[53:56] word the world of the the gospel going
[53:58] to the heathens and
[54:04] right where are
[54:06] we right but keep in mind with what I'm
[54:09] trying to say and then we'll just start
[54:11] on I don't mind quitting taking it sunay
[54:13] I mean next week no problem to
[54:18] me but remember we got to see him first
[54:20] as an antichrist Spirit that's right not
[54:23] as a man absolutely amen
[54:25] that's
[54:26] right so then listen so then you see
[54:30] when the seal actually broke it'll break
[54:32] to Israel he'll be a man
[54:35] absolutely now if that don't solve the
[54:37] problem with you that you can't see what
[54:39] I've tried to convince you for 40 years
[54:41] you got a
[54:44] problem when we get out of here and he
[54:46] goes as a man of sin he'll be a man
[54:49] right yes sir but he started off as a
[54:52] spirit
[54:54] MH and even when it becomes a false
[55:00] prophet you say it's a false prophet
[55:02] it's a
[55:03] man you don't crown
[55:05] him you can't crown him until it gets
[55:08] over far enough that he becomes a
[55:10] pope the pro false prophet wasn't
[55:13] crowned the pope is the one that's
[55:15] crowned amen that's right amen you know
[55:19] one of the guys out of all of the false
[55:21] prophets walks up and says hey I'm the
[55:24] PO
[55:29] come on then the Beast is when he'll
[55:32] really be a
[55:33] man because even the pope listen the
[55:38] pope of Rome is not at this time
[55:43] incarnate
[55:45] Satan he's incarnate false prophet with
[55:49] an antichrist system right amen yes yes
[55:53] he is not a man the the man of sin
[55:57] no right we see it as it works up toward
[56:02] land amen
[56:04] right it comes into being go ahead and
[56:07] now pull the scriptures up and let's
[56:08] read
[56:10] these CU John when he comes back from
[56:12] patmas
[56:14] yeah now he can remember some things
[56:18] some things was taken from
[56:20] him cuz he couldn't ride them and not
[56:23] being able to ride them
[56:25] brother R said he actually heard the
[56:27] Thunders yep but he couldn't write what
[56:29] it was
[56:32] right it was removed from him you say
[56:35] well how could that be all right what if
[56:38] you was taken
[56:42] up we set you over here in a room and we
[56:44] feed you a lot of
[56:46] information and you walk out of that
[56:48] room unless you got a photographic
[56:50] memory you're going to lose about 98% of
[56:52] what was taught you in that room right
[56:54] right
[56:55] that
[56:58] right that's why nonon would see
[57:00] chariots josling in the streets he saw
[57:04] Buicks and old mobiles running up down
[57:06] the highway because they had headlights
[57:07] on running like lightning the scripture
[57:10] says but he couldn't call them Buicks
[57:12] and no mobiles he didn't know the word
[57:14] no right he didn't know
[57:17] automobile so when he come back out he
[57:19] said what' you
[57:21] see I saw Chariot mhm and they were just
[57:25] running like lightning cuz they had big
[57:27] old lanterns hanging on boy they would r
[57:31] on you see what talking about John left
[57:34] patmas and come
[57:37] back you could have said John will you
[57:40] tell me what those Thunders are he said
[57:43] nope I heard them but it's gone from me
[57:47] y that
[57:49] y right yep sure come
[57:53] on right it
[57:55] was cuz when he was told to seal up
[57:59] things he couldn't say
[58:02] nothing but he did
[58:06] remember and John was the only one in
[58:08] the Bible that called it an antichrist
[58:11] right yes sir Paul called it Grievous
[58:13] wolves and stuff like
[58:16] that but John when he come back he wrote
[58:19] to Little John's there 1 2 and 3 I
[58:22] coming back from pmas he gets over there
[58:24] in Little John's you know what he said
[58:26] he just gets down he says little
[58:29] children love one
[58:31] another y brother Brown said when he got
[58:34] so old he couldn't do nothing else said
[58:35] he just sat around and told him said
[58:37] little children love one another you
[58:39] know why he had seen love yeah
[58:44] absolutely amen he had seen love in it
[58:47] total Apex of any height amen
[58:50] right and he might not have been able to
[58:52] tell us a lot of things but he could
[58:53] remember some of it right
[58:56] so John says it's an
[59:00] antichrist so by the time John got
[59:02] around to preaching maybe some of the
[59:03] others had talked about it and used the
[59:05] word Antichrist cuz they could
[59:07] comprehend what the word would be anti
[59:09] is against right all right and in
[59:13] Christ being the
[59:15] word so John writes his little John's
[59:17] and this is what he says right
[59:20] y 1 John 2:18 little children it is the
[59:24] last time as you have heard that
[59:27] Antichrist shall come even now are there
[59:30] many Antichrist whereby we know that is
[59:33] the last
[59:34] time and you read all around what he's
[59:36] saying on here but I'm just giving you
[59:38] the scripture 1 John 2 and22 who is a
[59:41] liow but he that denieth that Jesus is
[59:44] the Christ he is Antichrist that denieth
[59:48] the father and the
[59:49] sun I told you Sunday they use that
[59:52] scripture see to say you know that you
[59:55] you don't want to deny the father but
[59:57] let me use
[59:59] it if you don't
[1:00:04] believe in the father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:00:07] three
[1:00:08] manifestations of the same
[1:00:10] God you are a liar a deceiver and an
[1:00:17] antichrist brother brother brother R
[1:00:19] never done away with the teaching about
[1:00:20] a father a son and a holy ghost right
[1:00:23] that's right amen right
[1:00:25] I still have something to preach on that
[1:00:26] and ain't got back to it
[1:00:30] yet what 40 years yeah ain't no
[1:00:33] problem right I just keep studying and
[1:00:35] I'll finally get
[1:00:40] it but
[1:00:42] listen If you deny the father you're a
[1:00:46] Oneness right so you're an antichrist
[1:00:49] yep yes
[1:00:51] sir simple yep
[1:00:55] Jesus had a
[1:00:57] father well how could he be his own
[1:01:04] father he wasn't his own father right he
[1:01:08] had a father
[1:01:11] right and he had a mother but he
[1:01:13] wouldn't
[1:01:14] married his mother was a word amen his
[1:01:17] father was a word y amen that's what
[1:01:20] Hebrew uh what is it Hebrews 105 a body
[1:01:23] thou father has prepared
[1:01:29] me see the truth of one God doesn't do
[1:01:32] away with
[1:01:34] understanding of Father Son and Holy
[1:01:36] Ghost that's right it places it in order
[1:01:39] that we can understand the scriptures
[1:01:42] amen all right
[1:01:45] right 1 John 4 and3 and every spirit
[1:01:49] that confesses not that Jesus Christ is
[1:01:52] come in the flesh is not of God Y and
[1:01:56] this is that Spirit of
[1:01:59] antichrist
[1:02:01] whereof ye have heard that it should
[1:02:03] come and even now already is it in the
[1:02:08] world what the spirit of the
[1:02:12] Antichrist the man of sin sitting in the
[1:02:14] temple of God wouldn't I
[1:02:20] right the prophet wasn't there the Pope
[1:02:24] wasn't there was only
[1:02:28] Antichrist then John and them would pick
[1:02:30] up later in their D especially Paul and
[1:02:33] talk about false
[1:02:39] prophets because he could see a little
[1:02:41] bit about it 2 John
[1:02:45] 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into
[1:02:47] the world who confess not that Jesus
[1:02:51] Christ is come in the flesh this is a
[1:02:54] deceiver and an antichrist
[1:02:57] right
[1:02:59] right it was a spirit back
[1:03:02] there we'll read it in a minute I've got
[1:03:05] it in
[1:03:07] here we pick up these symbols first and
[1:03:09] I've got it in here when you quote
[1:03:12] that when Jesus went was taken
[1:03:17] up lifted up Judas was went out and hung
[1:03:20] himself when the Holy Spirit came back
[1:03:23] he said the Antichrist come back okay
[1:03:26] yep
[1:03:30] yep there that spirit all right but look
[1:03:35] John was shown these things John saw
[1:03:39] that white horse rider right and a
[1:03:42] horse and later on he admired the church
[1:03:46] that he saw right right that's
[1:03:50] right because it was beautiful amen
[1:03:56] yep
[1:03:58] absolutely now I've been over there and
[1:04:00] I'm not throwing off on they're doing
[1:04:02] I've been to these foreign countries a
[1:04:03] few of them and I'm not throwing off on
[1:04:05] their living in their houses and
[1:04:08] sometimes but you know this old building
[1:04:11] here ain't in too good a shape but it
[1:04:13] sure does look better than what you see
[1:04:15] over
[1:04:17] there and the fanciest ones you see
[1:04:22] right cuz you see on Theo lowers a hard
[1:04:25] tile and the walls are concrete with
[1:04:27] some kind of tiles or whatever is on
[1:04:29] them
[1:04:32] and yep me you and mold is everywhere if
[1:04:36] they don't take care of a lot of it yep
[1:04:38] and you look on the floor and you see a
[1:04:39] lot of them little little bitty bugs
[1:04:41] crawling around that you can't even
[1:04:43] hardly see that's right absolutely and
[1:04:46] you think I'm laying down in the East
[1:04:50] tonight you lay down in bed in about the
[1:04:53] middle of the night you wake up and they
[1:04:55] do something crawling all over you you
[1:04:57] want to get up and go take a bath and it
[1:04:59] in nice homes yeah that's a good
[1:05:03] one come on folks nice
[1:05:07] hes yeah but what can they do about
[1:05:11] it now I said that to say
[1:05:15] this so if John admired the
[1:05:17] church he saw a beautiful Church sister
[1:05:20] today that's right yes he did you say
[1:05:23] the temple that was built back there was
[1:05:24] beautiful I agree with you wonderful
[1:05:28] beautiful
[1:05:31] architect but now if you if you gave me
[1:05:34] an
[1:05:34] opportunity to receive an exact replica
[1:05:38] of the temple in the time of the Lord
[1:05:41] Jesus are some of these churches that
[1:05:45] are built in the last days I'd take the
[1:05:48] churches in the last days over
[1:05:52] there now where whether you would or not
[1:05:54] I don't know I think brother Gary would
[1:05:56] because he likes our condition yeah so
[1:05:59] at least he'd say our condition
[1:06:02] that do you get my point John admired it
[1:06:06] sure did amen it's beautiful to
[1:06:13] him almost deceived him
[1:06:17] right and you know it was so
[1:06:21] beautiful now swallow real good
[1:06:24] it was so beautiful until it deceived
[1:06:26] brother brandham until the seals broke
[1:06:30] right
[1:06:35] amen you say brother Dale be careful I'm
[1:06:38] very very careful I'm quoting behind
[1:06:42] him that church system had brother
[1:06:45] brandham de see he was going to preach
[1:06:48] that the white horse rider was the Holy
[1:06:50] Ghost right then you first seal and read
[1:06:55] that's what he was going to
[1:06:57] preach that was how deceiving it
[1:07:03] is and see we call
[1:07:05] it going right but listen John then what
[1:07:10] was a seal when it was
[1:07:12] broke the lamb had to break the seal
[1:07:15] couldn't be the devil doing it right so
[1:07:17] when the lamb broke the seal it showed
[1:07:20] that white horse
[1:07:22] rider
[1:07:26] and the only thing that was missing from
[1:07:28] him was two
[1:07:29] things when he first started a crown was
[1:07:32] missing right
[1:07:35] yep but the other thing was that he had
[1:07:37] no arrows right for his
[1:07:40] Bowen he had a bow with no arrows right
[1:07:44] that's right but the rest of the things
[1:07:46] he read right he was riding on a white
[1:07:50] horse brother brandom says now watch him
[1:07:53] he didn't say was a type of Christ he
[1:07:55] said he typed after

[1:08:39] of sin sitting in the temple of God to
[1:08:41] Israel to show himself to be as God
[1:08:43] until we get out of here that's right
[1:08:45] and the reason he can't he don't know
[1:08:47] how to do it right n amen yes sir that's
[1:08:51] it he don't know how to become the
[1:08:55] Beast
[1:08:57] until the bride becomes amen the
[1:09:01] Incarnate God right amen that's right
[1:09:06] correct not a son of God not a second
[1:09:09] person right incarnate God Amen how long
[1:09:14] have I been preaching on to you about it
[1:09:15] that we are the children of God we are
[1:09:17] the all spring of God but where God made
[1:09:19] manifest in another form called a rde
[1:09:21] right right so he can't be the Beast
[1:09:26] right you don't know how right God came
[1:09:29] back in a holy spirit on the dead
[1:09:31] Pentecost Satan copied it y with the
[1:09:34] Antichrist Spirit right amen God started
[1:09:37] using a fivefold Ministry to bring his
[1:09:40] word Satan pulled up his false prophets
[1:09:48] Y and God could become incarnate in his
[1:09:52] bride in the last days amen Satan he
[1:09:55] become incarnate in one man called the
[1:09:58] pope and then they've had many of them
[1:10:01] yeah you know how many gods are the got
[1:10:05] yeah but he can't be the Beast till we
[1:10:07] get out of here amen he's in the states
[1:10:09] right now of Incarnate false prophet
[1:10:12] through the
[1:10:14] pope that's where it's Advanced to now
[1:10:17] but he's still not called a man
[1:10:21] right he ain't called a man to sin until
[1:10:23] we get out of here
[1:10:25] right why because the opening of the
[1:10:28] first seal you saw a man riding on a
[1:10:30] horse yep right he that set there on yep
[1:10:35] M see so you start off by the prophet
[1:10:38] with the great wonderful
[1:10:41] understanding that started as an
[1:10:42] antichrist
[1:10:44] amen then it becomes a prophet to that
[1:10:47] Antichrist system amen then he becomes
[1:10:49] an incarnate false prophet as the
[1:10:52] pope and then he'll be be the beast when
[1:10:54] we get out of here
[1:10:57] right
[1:11:00] Church how long do we have to
[1:11:04] wait to get into this message right
[1:11:09] amen it's like I told him about the the
[1:11:12] minister brother we we go into the
[1:11:14] ministers meeting up there and I'm sorry
[1:11:16] I'm hateful I know but if there's 20 30
[1:11:19] there there'll be four or five at least
[1:11:21] out of the crowd and Ain even never read
[1:11:22] a Daniel 70 week book don't even have
[1:11:25] one of
[1:11:26] them but they'll tell you all about
[1:11:29] Daniel 70
[1:11:31] weeks and that's the hardest person to
[1:11:34] talk to
[1:11:36] amen is someone that ain't got enough
[1:11:38] sense to know when they're defeated by
[1:11:41] the word right
[1:11:43] amen well why did he say
[1:11:47] it that's the way people are and it
[1:11:50] ain't going to be nothing but just that
[1:11:51] point but if God can conin that's one
[1:11:54] person amen it'll be worth it
[1:11:57] all it's up to him to reveal not up to
[1:12:00] me that's right so listen it was first
[1:12:02] sent in the symbol so let's start on
[1:12:04] that go ahead brother number
[1:12:07] 11 I'm going to read a few of these and
[1:12:10] put it in and then we may have to stop
[1:12:12] on the last
[1:12:13] part the part I wanted to get
[1:12:17] to look what he says this is paragraph
[1:12:21] 146 of the first
[1:12:27] seal then when the lamb took the book
[1:12:29] and broke that first seal God spoke from
[1:12:33] his eternal Throne to say what that seal
[1:12:35] was to be revealed but when it's placed
[1:12:38] before
[1:12:39] John it was in a
[1:12:43] symbol a white horse a
[1:12:47] rider a bow in his hand no
[1:12:51] arrows and the crown was given him how
[1:12:57] simple when John saw it it was still a
[1:13:02] mystery one it wasn't even revealed
[1:13:06] right then it cannot be revealed until
[1:13:08] what he said here at the end time but it
[1:13:11] come in a
[1:13:13] symbol next that's part 11 paragraph 148
[1:13:18] it thundered as soon as the lamb struck
[1:13:19] back the seal and what it reveal not all
[1:13:22] of itself first it was
[1:13:24] God he speaking tell them what it is
[1:13:27] next it's a symble then it's revealed
[1:13:28] three things see it's coming forth from
[1:13:30] the throne first it can't be seen heard
[1:13:33] or nothing it's sealed up the Lamb's
[1:13:36] blood paid the price it thundered out
[1:13:37] when he spoke out and when he did white
[1:13:39] horse rider started
[1:13:41] out and it still was a symol
[1:13:46] y you see one right around we call it a
[1:13:50] Antichrist paragraph 150 and watch he
[1:13:53] said it would be known in the last days
[1:13:55] but it's come but it comes forth in a
[1:13:58] church symbol do you understand it
[1:14:00] Church it comes forth in a symbol of a
[1:14:02] church that they know there is a seal
[1:14:05] but just what it is yet they don't know
[1:14:07] because it's a white horse riter it's
[1:14:11] only and it's only to be revealed at the
[1:14:14] last days when this actual seal is
[1:14:16] broken broken to who not to Christ right
[1:14:20] but to the
[1:14:22] church
[1:14:23] breaking to you and
[1:14:30] I a church
[1:14:35] symbol all right a church
[1:14:41] symbol and why would it be a church
[1:14:50] symbol so evidently the Antichrist has
[1:14:52] been
[1:14:56] having a pretty good running sway as you
[1:14:58] can call it or running a pretty good
[1:15:00] route through the
[1:15:02] church
[1:15:06] right right
[1:15:09] right and you know it was the
[1:15:12] church as I quoted one ago if you want
[1:15:15] this you can have them I'm get them it
[1:15:17] was the bride the church that went to
[1:15:22] NAA
[1:15:27] sure they seen it was wrong and left
[1:15:31] right but that seed had done been
[1:15:34] planted what seed you remember what I
[1:15:37] told you the other day go read it and
[1:15:39] don't argue with me about it I don't
[1:15:41] believe that well go read it and call me
[1:15:45] up and tell me I'm
[1:15:47] wrong the first night see in counsil was
[1:15:50] not an argument over one God or three
[1:15:52] gods
[1:15:53] that's right right it was over whether
[1:15:55] Jesus was the substance or a like
[1:16:00] substance it was two men one of them is
[1:16:02] Aras and I can't remember the other naus
[1:16:06] or something I can't remember but it was
[1:16:08] two men and their argument was over
[1:16:10] until even the prophet said in the
[1:16:12] church age book that the world was
[1:16:14] divided over a vowel or something a mark
[1:16:18] over a
[1:16:21] word and you think that deceiving is not
[1:16:25] deceiving see the Antichrist is the spir
[1:16:28] the spirit of antichrist is the spirit
[1:16:30] of the devil okay mhm everybody got that
[1:16:33] right Spirit of the Antichrist is Spirit
[1:16:35] of the devil right all right now let me
[1:16:38] quote some from brother
[1:16:40] brandom he
[1:16:42] says in the church AG book talking about
[1:16:46] how they were arguing over these words
[1:16:47] and different
[1:16:49] things and he made an outstanding
[1:16:51] statement he said let me finalize this
[1:16:53] with one thing he said you mean those
[1:16:56] people back there knew exactly the
[1:16:59] letter of the
[1:17:02] Greek but he said why did they miss
[1:17:05] Jesus Christ standing there
[1:17:09] right now you know they knew the Greek
[1:17:12] right those religious leaders knew the
[1:17:15] Greek
[1:17:19] right what did they miss Jesus Christ
[1:17:24] when he came the exact way that the
[1:17:26] Bible said he would come you know why
[1:17:29] cuz they was deceived by the Antichrist
[1:17:32] right there's an outstanding quote I
[1:17:34] hope I have time when I get to it at the
[1:17:37] ministers meeting about the Daniel 70
[1:17:39] weeks he brother around him in covering
[1:17:41] dates and times he's covering 69 weeks
[1:17:43] of Messiah and all once he makes a
[1:17:46] statement it's in the seal book and he
[1:17:49] said see he's cut off 62
[1:17:52] weeks he said that's how many he's cut
[1:17:54] off out of the
[1:17:58] 70 he said m going
[1:18:02] just when they finished the
[1:18:05] temple in 49
[1:18:09] years God was put out of Israel right
[1:18:14] and proving that they had went after the
[1:18:16] Antichrist and his Doctrine right was
[1:18:19] they took yep barabus instead of Jesus
[1:18:23] that's
[1:18:25] right that Antichrist Spirit was so
[1:18:28] strong it had already
[1:18:31] deceived those Jews absolutely and God
[1:18:34] was cut off 62 weeks out of the 70 y
[1:18:38] because they crucified him at the end of
[1:18:40] 69
[1:18:45] weeks seven weeks was building the
[1:18:47] Temple he was with them sure he come
[1:18:50] down and anointed the temple d
[1:18:53] but you think they had anything else to
[1:18:55] do with God for the next
[1:18:57] 62
[1:18:58] weeks
[1:19:01] no the Antichrist had already
[1:19:04] sealed understanding and when they seen
[1:19:07] him coming in exactly the way the Bible
[1:19:09] said he would
[1:19:13] come they were already deceived by the
[1:19:16] Antichrist so John's right there's many
[1:19:21] Antichrist
[1:19:23] anybody denies that Jesus Christ
[1:19:26] is come in the flesh amen is an
[1:19:30] antichrist
[1:19:32] amen don't you see them Jews standing
[1:19:34] there saying oh yeah we believe you're
[1:19:36] Prophet oh yeah we believe Messiah we
[1:19:39] Rec the
[1:19:40] signs but we got it figured
[1:19:44] out we who
[1:19:47] right the Antichrist had already
[1:19:50] deceived them so much that they could
[1:19:52] couldn't understand amen that's right
[1:19:55] and kill their very God
[1:20:01] Y in that
[1:20:03] deception
[1:20:06] right those people when they got down
[1:20:10] there who was it pilot who say I can't
[1:20:14] kill him there's no no nothing wrong
[1:20:16] with
[1:20:17] him he said you ain't a friend of
[1:20:20] Caesars if you do that
[1:20:23] he said I wash my hands with their blood
[1:20:27] you know what they said let his blood be
[1:20:31] on us and our children and look at them
[1:20:36] ever since then they've been hated and
[1:20:37] chased around the
[1:20:39] world right and killed on every hand
[1:20:43] right because of that statement that
[1:20:46] their leaders made that's
[1:20:48] right and their leaders were deceived by
[1:20:51] the devil y
[1:20:54] there's your Antichrist spirit all the
[1:20:56] way through the Old Testament folks y
[1:20:58] absolutely amen it didn't come down to a
[1:21:01] church
[1:21:04] symbol how much more deceiving is a
[1:21:07] church than a beer joint yeah right
[1:21:12] amen come
[1:21:14] on
[1:21:20] deceived let's read these facts
[1:21:23] all right go to number 12 Brother
[1:21:26] Anderson the Seal of the Antichrist 1955
[1:21:29] paragraph
[1:21:30] E21 and about the time that the Holy
[1:21:33] Spirit came back upon the church to pull
[1:21:36] out of people for the bride the
[1:21:39] Antichrist came back also Now read it in
[1:21:42] 1 John 4 and3 and he that said and he
[1:21:46] said little children every spirit that
[1:21:48] confesses that Jesus has not come look
[1:21:50] how he puts it has not come in the flesh
[1:21:54] is not the spirit of God and this is the
[1:21:57] spirit of antichrist that should come
[1:21:59] into the world and already and already
[1:22:01] in the world working in the children of
[1:22:06] Disobedience see Jesus knew who he was
[1:22:09] facing right Satan that's right that's
[1:22:12] why he told in leaders he said you of
[1:22:14] your father the devil y let me
[1:22:18] paraphrase that he said you're so
[1:22:19] Anointed with the spirit of
[1:22:21] antichrist
[1:22:24] that you can't see that I am the Christ
[1:22:25] amen right did that change
[1:22:28] anything
[1:22:30] right was not that what was said to him
[1:22:34] amen foreal paragraph

[1:23:06] first the white horse rider it was the
[1:23:09] seals for told right y of what it would
[1:23:12] be made known to them cuz see the church

[1:23:36] four horse right colored all mixed up
[1:23:41] with all kind of colors to make him pale
[1:23:43] and

[1:23:50] Horse amen and he will be completely
[1:23:53] fully the Emmanuel the word of God
[1:23:56] incarnate in a man you see how much
[1:23:58] difference there is in them that's the
[1:24:01] difference though yeah questions and
[1:24:05] answers on the seals brother ROM does
[1:24:07] the first paragraph 199 brother does the
[1:24:10] first horse rider first seal fulfill
[1:24:13] second Thessalonians the revelation of
[1:24:15] the man of
[1:24:17] sin yes that's right that does that easy
[1:24:21] that does
[1:24:22] that's the man of sin this same man just
[1:24:26] keeps in stages riding on until he gets

[1:24:31] Christ comes on down through
[1:24:32] justification sanctification to the
[1:24:35] White Horse and that's to get life next
[1:24:40] amen first seal paragraph 295 remember
[1:24:43] in the church ages when we open the
[1:24:46] first church age back there we found out
[1:24:49] that the Holy Spirit was against a
[1:24:51] certain thing
[1:24:52] go to your church age book now go to
[1:24:54] reading your church
[1:24:56] ages that got started in that church and
[1:24:59] that was called the Deeds of the
[1:25:02] nicians you remember it niiko means to
[1:25:05] conquer Ley means the church the leoty
[1:25:09] nians to conquer the leoty take the Holy
[1:25:13] Spirit out of the church and give it all
[1:25:15] to one holy
[1:25:18] man let him be the boss of all of it you
[1:25:22] went through it the nickan notice nickan
[1:25:27] as a saying then in one Church they
[1:25:29] become a Doctrine in the next Church age
[1:25:32] and the third church it was a forcement
[1:25:35] and they had the Nan Council and it was
[1:25:38] then it was then made a Doctrine and a
[1:25:42] church that's right all
[1:25:45] right paragraph 297 the first seal look
[1:25:49] he starts out to conquer notice he has
[1:25:51] no crown
[1:25:53] the white horse rider I'm speaking of
[1:25:56] here see a bow and a crown was given him
[1:26:01] afterwards and he had no Crown to start
[1:26:03] with him really under your SE it says a
[1:26:06] crown was given it he said in a bat cuz
[1:26:08] you going to get the next seal he going
[1:26:10] to start
[1:26:12] killing right but a crown was given him
[1:26:15] notice later he was given a crown yay
[1:26:18] three of them three on one that was 300
[1:26:21] years years later at the Nan Council
[1:26:24] when he started out a spirit of Nici to
[1:26:27] form an organization among the people
[1:26:30] and then it kept on going going on kept
[1:26:33] on going on going on it become a saying
[1:26:36] then it become a Doctrine I on reading
[1:26:39] 298 you remember Christ speaking back to
[1:26:41] the church said thou hatest the Deeds of
[1:26:44] the nicians which I hate
[1:26:46] too trying to conquer take the Holy
[1:26:49] Spirit just on one holy man he can
[1:26:53] forgive all sins and everything have we
[1:26:56] just read it here Paul spoke of it that
[1:26:58] thing was said in the last days and he
[1:27:01] couldn't be revealed till the last days
[1:27:02] that's right and he that led us will
[1:27:04] take the spirit of God out of there and
[1:27:06] then he'll reveal himself today he's
[1:27:09] under disguised of a white horse watch
[1:27:12] how he changes from that white horse in
[1:27:14] a few minutes he don't only become a
[1:27:17] white horse he becomes a beast with many
[1:27:20] heads and horns see the the White Horse
[1:27:24] he's a deceiver now and that's the
[1:27:26] reason the people hasn't known it all
[1:27:27] this time they thought it but here it is
[1:27:31] now it's going to be revealed by the
[1:27:36] scripture paragraph 301 the first
[1:27:40] seal notice when nickan Antichrist is
[1:27:43] finally he's incarnate in a man then
[1:27:47] he's
[1:27:48] crowned when he starts off as a nielan
[1:27:51] spirit in the church he's a spirit you
[1:27:53] can't Crown a spirit but 300 years later
[1:27:58] he become a
[1:28:00] pope and then they crowned him he had no
[1:28:03] Crown to start with but he got a crown
[1:28:06] later yeah and when that Spirit become
[1:28:09] incarnate see he become a man nickan
[1:28:13] Doctrine become a man then they could
[1:28:15] crown it they couldn't do it because he
[1:28:17] was just a
[1:28:18] Doctrine now get what I was saying you
[1:28:21] say he becomes incarnate in man
[1:28:24] y but remember that's not the Beast
[1:28:29] right so the pope is not incarnate
[1:28:33] Satan he's incarnate false
[1:28:38] prophet he's not incarnate God I'm
[1:28:41] incarnate Satan right he's a good guy
[1:28:45] sure have a lot of people one of them
[1:28:47] got shot how many of us been shot for
[1:28:49] what we believe
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:53] paragraph 367
[1:28:55] 368 of the first seal now remember the
[1:28:58] Antichrist and the Beast is the same
[1:29:00] self Spirit there's the Trinity yes sir
[1:29:04] it's three stages of the same devil
[1:29:07] power remember Nica see it had to be
[1:29:11] incarnate before it could be crowned see
[1:29:14] now watch this three stages first he's
[1:29:17] called Antichrist second stage he's
[1:29:20] called the false prophet third stage
[1:29:22] he's called the

[1:31:15] room presuming the church ages are
[1:31:19] 378 of the church age book
[1:31:22] see how that Judah spirit that Judah
[1:31:24] Spirit came back as a rider on a white
[1:31:27] horse it was white so close to the real
[1:31:31] just as Judas was so close to Jesus a
[1:31:34] crown was given to him what or rer how
[1:31:38] that Spirit was now in the leader of the
[1:31:40] nickan system and he was a triple crown
[1:31:44] Pope who said as God in his
[1:31:47] Temple calling himself the Vier of
[1:31:49] Christ and Vier means instead of Christ
[1:31:52] or in place of or on behal of God then
[1:31:57] the pope was calling himself the Holy
[1:31:58] Ghost are disposing the holy ghost
[1:32:02] acting for him that was the Judah spirit
[1:32:05] in him doing that see how he conquered
[1:32:08] going
[1:32:10] forth conquering and Conquer Christ did
[1:32:13] not do that the only ones that come to
[1:32:16] him were already predestinated by the
[1:32:18] father and so on and on went that spirit
[1:32:23] and one day it will become truly
[1:32:25] incarnate in a man who will head up the
[1:32:27] World Council of churches control the
[1:32:30] whole world and the Antichrist system
[1:32:33] will own everything and try to control
[1:32:36] everybody Jesus will come back and
[1:32:38] Destroy them with the brightness of his
[1:32:40] coming and their end will be the Lake of
[1:32:43] Fire amen paragraph
[1:32:45] 190 Second seal then he become an
[1:32:49] antichrist now he couldn't be anti
[1:32:51] Christ only in spirit then he become an
[1:32:53] antichrist and that Spirit took a man
[1:32:55] that taught the same thing that that
[1:32:57] Antichrist Spirit was doing and then he
[1:32:59] become a false prophet that the
[1:33:01] Antichrist Spirit now what about a man
[1:33:04] in an organization suits yourself that's
[1:33:07] pretty good point right I don't know
[1:33:10] what you think about it but all
[1:33:13] right now finally he become a beast and
[1:33:16] wait we'll get in that in after a while
[1:33:19] all right now if say 's Trinity L lays
[1:33:23] like that Satan all the time Satan
[1:33:26] Antichrist Spirit the Antichrist Spirit
[1:33:29] incarnate false prophet then becomes the
[1:33:32] Beast
[1:33:34] see when not a demon that was in that
[1:33:37] Antichrist but when Satan himself is CED
[1:33:41] out he comes down and takes over the
[1:33:44] place where the demon was the devil then
[1:33:47] then the devil is carnate in is
[1:33:49] Incarnate in a man it's just just
[1:33:51] repeating itself now he's cast out as we
[1:33:54] go up right I ain't got time to explain
[1:33:57] it right that's right when we go up
[1:33:59] Satan's cast
[1:34:00] outen he can't be up there when we're up
[1:34:03] there he's up there right now accusing
[1:34:04] us right but he can't be there when we
[1:34:07] get there he's cast out so he becomes
[1:34:10] incarnate Amen in the Beast he becomes a
[1:34:14] man of sin right paragraph 160 the four
[1:34:17] seal I want you to notice the four of
[1:34:20] them notice the off Mark of four of the
[1:34:23] spiritual mathematics God is streets
[1:34:26] this is four he's in four here first
[1:34:30] Antichrist
[1:34:32] white Now read it look at it first
[1:34:37] Antichrist white that's the White
[1:34:41] Horse second false prophet red that's
[1:34:45] your second
[1:34:46] s third vior of heavens and earth and
[1:34:50] purgatory
[1:34:54] black now I got my numbers wrong with
[1:34:56] the red the white is the first seal
[1:35:00] right red is the second seal the black
[1:35:03] is the third seal right and the fourth
[1:35:06] is the Beast Pale Horse Satan being
[1:35:09] kicked out of heaven you want to read
[1:35:11] that Revelation 1213 Satan being kicked
[1:35:14] out of heaven then in Revelations 13:1
[1:35:18] he is Incarnate in the person of the
[1:35:20] Beast he's the Antichrist just a
[1:35:22] teaching called niol then he comes from
[1:35:24] that to a false prophet if he's an
[1:35:27] antichrist Antichrist is against
[1:35:29] anything that's against God's word is
[1:35:31] against God because the word is God okay
[1:35:35] amen there the reason he didn't receive
[1:35:37] a just a crown with Bo and no ARS
[1:35:41] right now this is a repeat of 301 I want
[1:35:44] to read 301 and
[1:35:46] 303 this is a repeat so it's on your
[1:35:49] things double repeat
[1:35:52] paragraph 301 through
[1:35:54] 303 of the first seal notice when
[1:35:56] nicadan spirit is finally he's incarnate
[1:35:59] in a man then he's crowned then he
[1:36:01] starts off as a nicadan spirit in the
[1:36:03] church he's a spirit you can't Crown the
[1:36:05] spirit but 300 years later be he become
[1:36:07] a pop and then they crowned him he had
[1:36:10] no Crown to start with but he got a
[1:36:12] crown later see when that Spirit became
[1:36:14] incarnate see that's in the PO now
[1:36:16] that's not the Incarnate Beast right
[1:36:20] listen and he a man ni and Doctrine
[1:36:23] become a man then they could crown it
[1:36:26] they couldn't do it because he was just
[1:36:27] a
[1:36:28] Doctrine notice when this holy spirit
[1:36:30] that we have becomes incarnate in us the
[1:36:32] one that's in our midst now the form of
[1:36:34] the Holy Ghost becomes incarnate in Us
[1:36:36] in the person of Jesus Christ we'll
[1:36:39] crown him King of Kings that's the way
[1:36:42] Satan learned that to be the
[1:36:44] beast when God becomes incarnate in you
[1:36:47] and I Satan will know how to do it so he
[1:36:51] just comes right to that
[1:36:53] false prophet deal right and that Pope
[1:36:58] becomes Satan incarnate now remember
[1:37:01] about the time Christ come on the throne
[1:37:04] the Antichrist come on the throne Judas
[1:37:06] about the time Christ went off the Earth
[1:37:09] Judas went off the
[1:37:10] Earth just about the time the Holy
[1:37:13] Spirit Come Back the Antichrist come
[1:37:15] back you see John said over here little
[1:37:17] children I would not have you ignorant
[1:37:20] you know about the Antichrist which is
[1:37:22] already come and working in the children
[1:37:24] of Disobedience the Antichrist then
[1:37:26] there he was began to form in there the
[1:37:30] nickan spirit to make an organization no
[1:37:33] wonder I hated that thing now listen to
[1:37:35] your Prophet see there you are it wasn't
[1:37:41] me and see people thinks he hates
[1:37:43] organized religion churches you he
[1:37:46] doesn't hate that he hates organized
[1:37:47] religion right right no wonder I hated
[1:37:49] that thing see there you are it wasn't
[1:37:51] me it was something in here there's the
[1:37:54] thing it's come out you see it I was all
[1:37:56] around the side of it I couldn't see it
[1:38:00] till
[1:38:03] now are you read MH is what your Prophet
[1:38:10] said I know it now there it is that
[1:38:13] nickan Spirit God hated and now that
[1:38:17] Spirit become incarnate they crown it
[1:38:19] and here it right here in the Bible did
[1:38:21] they do with it
[1:38:23] perfect even he didn't see it amen
[1:38:27] right he couldn't understand why he was
[1:38:29] seemingly against
[1:38:31] NOP organized religion so much right
[1:38:35] when the seals broke they showed him
[1:38:37] that's right sure
[1:38:40] did I hope you understand what I mean
[1:38:43] what I'm trying to say that's
[1:38:45] right you think I can't be deceived by
[1:38:48] an antichrist Spirit we already was yes
[1:38:52] amen the prophet had problems with
[1:38:57] it he said I didn't know it till just
[1:39:00] now right he said I'd have made a
[1:39:02] horrible mistake
[1:39:04] right if the Lord hadn't to come down
[1:39:07] and corrected me on what I fixing to
[1:39:09] R cuz he's going to preach the white
[1:39:11] horse rider right as a holy ghost no
[1:39:14] that's what he already
[1:39:18] sa now maybe a time like in Daniel said
[1:39:21] weeks he mentions about the Antichrist
[1:39:24] and the being the I think it's in that
[1:39:26] one there's one back there I know that
[1:39:28] he mentions that like the white horse
[1:39:30] rider would be the the
[1:39:32] Antichrist but see he didn't see it
[1:39:35] until it opened in the seals do you
[1:39:37] understand right right what he say what
[1:39:41] you understand the four stages
[1:39:44] man see it's
[1:39:46] Antichrist
[1:39:50] prophet
[1:39:51] incarnate false prophet What Spirit
[1:39:54] incarnate in a
[1:39:56] man make him a
[1:39:59] pope but that Pope still is not the man
[1:40:01] of sin right he's not dead until we get
[1:40:05] out of here right now you caught what
[1:40:08] I'm saying the first seal says that
[1:40:10] there was a man on that horse right
[1:40:14] right a rider on the horse y right a man
[1:40:18] right mhm that's second th Ians yeah
[1:40:22] that's the Antichrist in its fullness
[1:40:24] right amen we see where it come from
[1:40:27] that's right yes sir the man of sin
[1:40:30] sitting in the temple of God is not a
[1:40:32] baby Doctrine what is that Paul said in
[1:40:35] the children of Disobedience and some
[1:40:38] way let's see what brother around say
[1:40:39] I'm trying to paraphrase it he said if
[1:40:41] you think that this deceiving in the
[1:40:43] children he said what about when it
[1:40:44] becomes an
[1:40:47] adult if it started out deceiving what
[1:40:49] do you think it is now man that's right
[1:40:52] yes sir now you see all of these
[1:40:55] doctrines of the people in this message
[1:40:57] y out of one message thousands of
[1:41:03] doctrines ain't that mixed up in a good
[1:41:05] Baptist Church
[1:41:10] right who was it now they said Paul
[1:41:13] Harvey did I don't know said he said one
[1:41:15] day he said them brand Ms are not a cult
[1:41:17] cuz they don't follower their leader
[1:41:19] yeah
[1:41:23] exactly right that's
[1:41:25] right listen
[1:41:30] Church don't think you're ever a match
[1:41:33] for the devil no sir

[1:41:39] am brother brandham was not a match for
[1:41:41] the devil that's right
[1:41:46] amen amen it takes the Holy Spirit to be
[1:41:49] a match for the day amen even as we're
[1:41:52] showing in Daniel 70 weeks even the
[1:41:54] great Gabriel that brought the message
[1:41:57] to Mary of the birth of Jesus Christ was
[1:42:00] not able to handle right
[1:42:03] Satan yep Christ had to come to his
[1:42:07] rescue amen that's
[1:42:10] right now I don't think they got out
[1:42:12] there know good crate kid you
[1:42:19] know

[1:42:27] of places look people dead in the
[1:42:30] eye you better be ready to back up what
[1:42:33] you're
[1:42:34] doing but if you really got the goods

[1:42:45] message I don't mind looking anybody
[1:42:46] straight in ey right
[1:42:49] amen you'll see them start turning their
[1:42:52] head
[1:42:53] yeah why because they can't stand it
[1:42:57] it's not a pressured fight it's not
[1:42:58] kicking pops and you know boxing and
[1:43:05] stuff even Satan and Gabriel wasn't
[1:43:08] doing that is just he was holding
[1:43:11] him Michael just walked in
[1:43:17] yep you didn't have to hit nobody no
[1:43:20] that's right he just walked
[1:43:22] in his presence came in right brother

[1:43:53] see
[1:43:55] them if they put out
[1:43:58] that not trying to prove nothing but one
[1:44:01] thing a man's got the goods he ain't no
[1:44:04] problem with him being tested right

[1:44:48] stand it I got it behind him I said
[1:44:50] listen
[1:44:51] according to the
[1:44:53] prophet that white horse rider
[1:44:56] Antichrist thing is a Theon

[1:45:12] converted that person that's a false
[1:45:14] prophet to an antichrist system won't be
[1:45:17] converted nen that incarnate false
[1:45:20] prophet to the pope you think you got
[1:45:21] much hopes of getting him
[1:45:24] converted what about when he
[1:45:27] becomes the man of
