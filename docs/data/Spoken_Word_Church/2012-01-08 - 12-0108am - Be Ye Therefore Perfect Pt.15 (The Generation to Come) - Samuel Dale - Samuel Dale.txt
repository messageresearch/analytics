and amen amen I want to see don't you good to be in the house of the Lord good to see everybody just remember those that are away and I wa down preaching with brother Collins last night and today we had a real good time last night went down and fellowship with them a little bit you know had a good time in the Lord I got even with Terrence cuz you know how he's always coming along tapping me in the back of the head because we past life when we used to take him around to everybody's house and they had to eat bean sprouts and stuff like that you know because we was trying to be nice so I got even with him last night and brother Colin was want to know if I could lead singing I said no but Terren can't I got eat with just get himat me but we had a good time it was Wai wait really done a marvelous job preaching you know and really really did remember my wife this morning uh we got in last night about 11:00 and she just couldn't go to sleep and took a migraine headache and she's in the bed this morning with the migraine headache so remember her and just just keep praying for her that the Lord would take that away from her and let everything be all right now remember the Bible study will be this coming Saturday 6:00 so remember that cuz we we wouldn't able to have it yesterday because the way being gone and everything didn't want to do it that way so we'll have the the Bible study now there won't be any uh uh communion foot washing until next month so we announce it where we won't get everything tied up cuz we already had it first of the year and I we appreciate amen you like turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading in Matthew 5 and then we will go to Psalms 102 Matthew 5 and Psalms 102 I want to try to continue on the thought of what we were talking about on the new creation our Wednesday night and you know kind of carry it on over to a little further and and tie it together with the entire Bible to where we can see you know because I I as a firm believer I believe that by the new birth we are a new creature in Christ Jesus amen but in body and spirit we're still in this old natural creation and things of life but I believe in a Redemption that's right of not only the soul I believe in the body the spirit being redeemed to be a new creation and even this world to be a new creation right so Isaiah said you know that he create a new heavens and a new Earth I believe in that but not a different one right it's the same one made over cleansed and and redeemed so then that way nobody can't misunderstand what I'm trying to say and trying to bring unto you but you know just just remember that okay let's pray father we thank you for this day and your love unto us we thank you for your grace we ask you to just bless us now with your presence give us understanding ears that we may hear lead us by Thy Thy love Lord we bless way there today as he's ministering for brother Collins and we pray that you'd be with them and open their understanding and his that he may speak unto them and just let your love be there we ask you to be with our wife this morning that's old headaches and things that she has father we condemn them through the blood of Jesus Christ and believing that all is well we love you and we thank you and just have your way now in each one as we try to speak about you today you come on the scene and speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins because we want to be covered and kept covered by the blood guide us now and lead us Lord in Jesus name amen amen we've been reading this scripture and the way it looks now ANC I try to I'm going quitting announcing ahead of time all right I thought I'd try to get over this afternoon to questions and answers but looks like it's probably at least going to be next weekend uh to do because you know there won't be we won't be able to get to it I've got some points I'm wanting to bring to you and as I try to get something it just keeps unfolding so you know we just keep going also too now remember that on the 18th on Wednesday the Aaron will be preaching for you here because uh brother Donnie and Zach and Wade and myself will be in Alabama hunting for that week that'll be we start on the 16th I think and true but then we had to change the fellowship meeting and I don't really know where they're where it's going to be because we asked them to put it off from here it would due our time but we ask them to please change it to somebody else to where we could do it because you know it's not that you make some one thing above the other one but when things are set in order then sometimes it's hard to change and all so it's you say well you could go deer hunting at another time well that's true but we try to go for the prime time to where we can you know to be able to do and all like that but just forgive us if you don't agree course a lot of people don't agree we're going do them anyway so then that wouldn't change nothing you know it's just all the same but that's that's all right you just uh you do your thing I have to do mine and then I just tell you where I stand and where we walk in the Lord all right so just remember that and uh just Let Your Love be made manifest and uh father just bless us as we read your word yes you come on the scene now and you have your way in Jesus name Matthew 5:37 let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if we love them which love for if you love them which love you what reward have you ye do not even the publicans are say and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now we'll go over to Psalms 102 we'll begin about verse 16 when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his Glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord for Heath looked down from the heights of the sanctuary from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death now the main thought will be taken from verse 18 for this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word so you see immediately that we're still tying together with the uh message on Wednesday of the new creation so we're reading here that that there will be a people a generation see this is written for the generation that is to come right and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord so then we're we're not looking at something different or odd we're looking at the opening of the word and trying to follow that and then we know in Revelations 3:14 the message to the Ladi lady in church age is that he's the beginning of the creation of God all right so then if it means what it means as we do in the English language if he's the beginning of the creation of God then that means there will be more to that creation and that's the point I'm trying to get you and I to see is our part of that because by the new birth we become the children of God we become his offspring everybody brother Donnie and I talking about it last night coming back home every child in the world every person in the world is is a child of God by creation cuz he created him I mean there's no way the Devil Couldn't create right but now when it came down to life and sin entered the picture then you find out that in the Old Testament then they wouldn't be called the children of God they would be servants or things like that me using the words to signify but then when Jes Jesus came he was the beginning of the creation of God in other words God came down in human flesh amen took upon himself the form of human flesh and started a total New Creation as way was talking about last night about the uh the fact of him being his DNA see then you can't find the DNA of the Lord Jesus connected to mankind right cuz there's no way cuz he was a new creation and like we were talking about and I've expressed it to you and I know I spend a lot of time explaining things but I I don't want you to be confused and then just the devil can just play with your mind and all but him being a new creation then the prophet of God saying it he said his body came out of this Earth okay but did it come out of this sinful Earth because it went on for about 4,000 years before his body appears did he come out of the sinful Earth all right if he did it wouldn't be a new creation that's right Adam was a new creation right right because there was no creation before them so he was a new creation all right first of that human race well the Lord Jesus was a new creation of the this new race right that was going to be The Offspring of God all right then in that then the the Bible and the prophets right and we we stay with what we believe on it but yet did his body come out of this natural sinful Earth or did his body come from the original creation his body came not as a 16 elements of Christ that we've polluted he didn't take that and make a body he went back to the original creation and brought the body into existence because there's no way to connect your DNA to any human being upon Earth that's right because he was God made manifest in flesh he created a body to come down and live in all right that's the beginning of the creation of God was that body that he was there and we'll get to that in a little bit but I'm wanting you to see our part then because that to me me is the the great thing of the end time to understand is the revelation of one true and living God that's right all right see if we're One Creation he's another creation talking spiritually now we know he was physically but yet by the new birth he makes us his children then we are his offspring then if he's One Creation in a spiritual sense and we're another Creation in a spiritual sense what have you got you got something separate and it wouldn't work out and I I love to to uh you know uh to read what the prophet of God has said and and I'm I'm not saying this wrongly but the man that done the the bringing of the church age book into existence into words you know and put it down uh he evidently doesn't agree with the things that he wrote In the book I guess because brother brandom made him write it cuz he said himself that there was a lot of things he didn't want to put in there that brother R said you put it in there like that well you know that's that's I believe then the church age book is is authentic that's right I don't have no problems with it I challenge anybody to come and show me oh yes they wrote me a letter one time we got 17 contradictions in it I said come on show me one of them well they never come yet so you know but they say they got 17 because of this or something like that I said well come on show me so you'd say well brother rer said in the church age book that the Rapture would take place on the fourth seal and how did he know that well remember the church AE book wouldn't put out until after the SKS was preached I mean Common Sense answers most of their contradictions but they don't think about it like that well whether the man that wrote it agreed with it or not I don't have no problem I love it right because the church Agee book shows us and to me that's the greatest book to introduce the prophet's message with that's the one I use you may use different ones I use a church age book why cu the first 10 and something pages is is one God and serpent SE amen all right if they can swallow that you know you can move on you got the water baptism you got all of the one God and then you got the serpent seat you know right so it's a good thing to introduce so let's just read something we've read it many times but I want to make sure you get it you know get it yourself and understand it I'm not talking about just a revelation of a group of people or somebody that we think oh great look who we are you know look what we are it's not it's all in him if we have any honor glory whatsoever it's all in Jesus Christ it's not in you and I we're not worth nothing we're nothing but just the same old elements that Adam was made from you know and from the same one ones that can and and and all of that the garbage cuz see our M and daddies did eat eat us here you're body come from your mama and daddy and your grandmother and your granddaddy and etc etc etc they kept eating kept eating kept eating and finally It produced a a germ or whatever you want to call it to come forth and bring your natural body into existence but the Lord Jesus didn't come that way he come by creation all right so the new the the bride that I'm talking about is not the old order the prophet said will read made over or it wouldn't be called a new creation that's right all right see as I said Adam was a new creation nothing ever been created like Adam that's right so he was a new one he was the first of the human race all right but it meant there would be more to come all right Jesus was the first of this creation this race of God in human flesh amen amen all right but it showed there would be more right which would be you and me that's right all right see then we we wouldn't have to worry about it we could follow along and and that's why I love what the prophet has to say so let's go to 336 of the church age book and just get what the prophet is saying to us and read yourself in there I know we read this over and over and over but still read it and get yourself in there see he's not just explaining one God but he's not just explaining the bride he's explaining the whole thing of redemption that would come forth so now watch what he say but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stand there revealing who he is in this life age watch he calls himself the man didn't do that he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation what this has to do with the church now the message to the lady you see in church age is the message of revelation of one true and living God but to show you that God and where he's at no other age has that Revelation given unto him as I said the other day Paul in his saying that you know that we're a new create creature a new creation everybody received a new birth everybody down through time from from Pentecost till now that's received the new birth is a new creature in Christ Jesus right all right part of this race because it started a super race of people all right but no age understood who they were right all right then in understanding who we are all right and remember it is he that has made us not we ourselves so we're out of it it's what he takes to us all right but see he's made us this new creation all right that's why when we get there there'll be plenty of people be given eternal life yeah but they won't be a part of that in you race it won't be his wife that's right they won't be his bride whatever word you want to use that's right because they don't step into that line that's right all right then you can get into all of the things that we was this and we was that before the world why not just get down where we at and stay here where we're at and just let go on from here because I can't go back there right but I can start here and move on and see who I am amen all right see then if he's explaining one God as he says he is and says this is the true revelation of God then you're a part of God that's that seems to be hard for the human mind to comprehend but I'm not talking about your body that's the old order of man right that come from the adamic fall that's the old order and the prophet says here he's not dealing by ways of the old order he's dealing by a new creation we'll get to it this afternoon maybe a little see this creation that I'm talking about can't sin right right amen but the body that we live in by the spirit that we have that is in a fallen condition is still subject to life that's right right and can sin that's right that's right all right so we're in a split Condition it's not that he doesn't impute sin to the soul the soul can't sin that's right I don't want to get on that that's that's in my mind so we'll get back to that this evening all right but now listen see now he's standing in the midst of his church he's not outside right he's in his church amen all right you well over there it says he knocks at the door yeah cuz he's outside the church world all right where's the bride how is he outside of the church world today now listen that's why I try like to I like to explain things to where you know that he's in the church world today Healing The Sick and and they're shouting and having glorious times and worshiping and and all kind of you know he's there right right well then why does the bible say that he's outside the door knock you because he's in you and you can't get in that church that's right oh yeah if you lay down everything you believe and if you don't say nothing about what you believe you're welcomed right that's right but if you just won't go in there with long ha they know right real quick it's something different about you Y and you're not welcomed that's right see that way you are the one that's outside of the church the church world you are the bride that's been called out of the church system all right so then where's he at he's in you and me but he can be there to heal the sick all kind of things can happen in the churches but he's outside the door because the word has been put out right well you and I are the word amen right do you follow what I'm trying to bring yes but he calls himself this says this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself now he just said it was the church then he said it's himself right are you are you reading right he said it's the church but then he said it's himself right so The Church Must Be himself amen amen right right she's the one that's outside that's right she's the one that's trying to get back in right all right so watch what he saying this is a special designation of himself watch he is the creator of that church now watching so evidently as I said they even caught the point of what he was talking about about the writer that put it down you know into words must have caught what he was the point or either the Holy Spirit made him catch it because it should have been when he come down to the church he it should have been divided into paragraphs but it wasn't divided into paragraphs so it must have the same point did everybody understand what I mean by that yes when you change the thoughts you're supposed to change paragrass that's right amen so now he's talking about a bride and he's talking about how he's created the church then he immediately starts talking about his body right right whatever then it's got to be tied together so what the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride okay we can follow that yes all but how did he do it how did he create his own right as the spirit of God he's explaining how he done it that's right right as the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born amen that's right now he's talking about his natural body right but if you and I right wasn't in him when he was in that body now you follow me not in the DNA not in the the running around in the sails and a little bitty no no no no we was in the God that was in the body that's right right amen that created his own body which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very C in the wound of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human ovium supplied by Mary so see that does away with all of the things the connections the DN the things he said that would have been sinful mankind producing a body right because the woman has the egg right the egg is where the body comes forth from gerti by The Germ right all right so then she didn't have anything to do with it cuz he ain't talking about a natural body he talking about a spiritual body within himself he's talking about his own natural body right but showing us that that natural body was almighty God right right am not another person not this that or the other but almighty God that's going to come into manifestation and it didn't end it a Calvary it didn't end with him here upon Earth cuz now we're his body right come on follow the whole point it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human over and Supply by Mary that would have been the sin been sinful mankind producing a body right that would not have produced the last Adam right all right of whom it was said Lo a body hast thou father prepared for me God not Mary provided that Holy provided that body Mary was a human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son Son of God he was of the new creation God and man met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race all right now if he's the head of this new race then what would that make him Colossians 1:18 he is the head of the body the church so now who's the body we're his body right right that's right right so a body thou Hast prepared me that's right back there it was one body for God to live in right amen that's right now by the new birth we become the body of Jesus Christ so he hasn't stopped see when he created that body he didn't stop creating he's creating a bride to be his body am so as long as the members of the body of Christ are coming into the body God still created that's right he hasn't stop that's right he stopped the physical turned it into a spiritual all right he's the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have to PR second Corinthians 5:17 therefore any man be in Christ is a new creation new creatur old things that passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation that's what we was now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God now that's only in your soul right that's only in your soul right that's right that's right so we have to make a way to make these bodies a new creation right all right see that's the key to the end time is that we're here where this can be done right and all of the world Hebrews what is it 11:40 they're waiting on us right amen see to realize who we are Amen to step out on who we are and claim it that's right and walk for forth into him all right you can see that though man was of the old order of creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God that's Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus un good works Ephesians 4:24 and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness look this cre new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation right simple language right right all right it is another creation are you listening it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's issued Through The Godly Isaac line but but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator created himself a part of his creation and that's something in it God the Creator created his part of his own creation yes but look what he says it is this is the true revelation of God how can you see God without coming through the fact of finally realizing it has to deal up in with the church this is the revelation of God the true Revelation is one that he is the beginning of the creation and we're the rest of the creation he's not talking about our bodies in that that has to come forth into an understanding for this age right each age can get the Revelation I keep saying it of that they are a new creature that's right Paul said old things have passed away he said the Liv that I now live in this flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God see they could see that were new creatures in Christ Jesus but the end time Revelation is to see that we are going to have to be connected and I I'm just honest I don't believe they seen that that is what we see about that we're a part of God you said well I what I do too I believe they knew they were new creatures and that God was living in them but do you think they understood that they were actually a part of God to be made manifest I don't necessarily think they did that's right I believe that's the end time he says that's the true revelation of God what all this we've got to reading up above there about the bride and who we are and the new creatures is a true Revelation that's true of God Amen God living in his people right right God manifesting himself in his people all this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took form through election right how could you just stop on each one see that is why you look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to P by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them through the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his own if omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pipes how El could he know what's not he brought it to P how else could he know what that he be wor standing in the midst of the church you remember the Bible where it said you stand in the midst of seven golden Candlestick he standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren what if he did not make sure what how could he be doing how could he be standing there how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren if he did not make sure all things in you and all things are going to work to his honor and Glory that's right if I were you I would read that over and over and over and read yourself there but don't jump up there now s of a bodily thing until you start dealing with you know well then it don't matter what I do cuz I'm saved anyway brother Dell Don't Preach junk that's right brother said you sin a sin as a Christian he said you will repay TB F right but you can't be lost that's right well then don't make no D what to do because it can't be lost well if you think like that then you're already lost that's right is that plain enough I know I don't play games with wor that's right if we think we can this sin and live like the devil and get by with it then we're lost that's right well then you you do like the brother got mad at me when I he was telling me something and I just said well if you do that you're lost he went and told everybody I said he's lost I didn't say he's lost I said if he acted like that that was his choice not mine I believe in in being the truth of it don't you yes all right let's just read a few things look at the next one this is confirmation and evidence or e41 watch what he said now I feel religious why we are dead now how do you become a new Creature if you're still alive in your soul you're not born again that's right that plain enough yes you're still alive in your soul you're not born again if you're dead and let him come alive that's see it right there okay that's that's simple yes so the qualification for being a new creation has got to be dead that's right dead to yourself not dead physically that's right but dead to yourself that's what justification and sanctification done and then the Holy Ghost burning out right it destroys that old man that's true all right so watch what he said we are dead and our lives is hid in God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost I look back and see where I once was that William brandom died 32 years ago and now we are a new creation in Christ already raised with him and sitting with him in Heavenly places with the authority of his promise word every devil subject to that you said well I tell you what it don't look like it because look at all these Devils what do you think about the Lord Jesus in his life we think every devil was subject to it but you know what every devil in the world was I how could he be look 50 and only 30 because of the toils and the life and the doing that's right but see we think well the devil won't bother you no more after you become a Christian I ain't never preach nothing like that right I'd rather preach that you're going to have all the money in the world if you become a Christian I got Bible for that right he pour out his blessings that you can't control I'd rather go that way I Don't Preach riches as a Christian right right that's why people don't understand me I try to preach it straight that's right many are the afflictions of the righteous right well if I was a Christian I wouldn't be sick show me the Bible for that and Bre around Jo need one oh you never will have no more troubles somebody lied to you is that plain enough but we don't GL around and do like I said man told me that time said I I didn't know I was a Christian I found out that Christian have troubles and I have a lot of trouble so I must be a Christian that ain't it either the prophet said to what the the flowy skies and the things was the sign of God's approval neither was the the horrible things that would take place the sign of his disapproval he said his approval was in the elect right the church right God wants children amen that's right they can stand by the word that's right now come on around said a Christian is rugged but you know what if I said what I think most of the time a lot of you would have done been gone you said oh no oh yeah I try to be nice you said well just tell me like it is had two brothers tell me that one time I said you don't want me to tell you like it is cuz neither one of you would speak to me again after then but you see it's good to make a flapper of the mouth ain't it you let it tell me like it is brother Dale that's right uh-uh you tell people like it is and they're going to be gone well just run them off no I'm trying to save Souls I ain't trying to buildings everybody thinks I am but I'm trying to save Souls come on church if we're a part of God God can't get his feelings hurt that's right that's right cuz he don't have any feelings to get hurt that way that's right he said brother Dale you hurt my feelings that was my body dealing with your body to our Spirits cuz if you got the Holy Ghost and I got it it certainly can't be no offense in that that's right right that's right right come on wake up than let's face life and see where we're at I try to explain things and I get in trouble for trying to explain it amen I thinking there that scripture where it talks about you know if a man sue you at the law for you Coke just give him you cloak also I don't I don't think you ought to say okay now you know somebody sued me well I just take everything got that give it to him that's not what the Bible's talking about well it says that well go ahead I don't see you going down there giving it to him either right right I try to be sensible about everything because to me that's the only thing the Bible is the only thing that is sensible this message is the only thing that's sensible yes that's right that's why if you just be plain sensual about something it work out more than it will to try to prop it up and do everything else amen if we're a new creation in Christ Jesus then we're to live like it that's right right well you mean you won't never get your feet hurt I say that that's right but you can't get that soul to be hurt amen right that's right I told you about it you believe what you want to when I saw that person that time and I I was looking at a person condemning that person and what I did about that time something happened and I just backed up in a tunnel I was still standing there looking and I just went back in a tunnel and I saw that person as God saw him that's really been a help to me cuz that way I can you know I can try to preach and not condemn let's get on with it brother said that that man was dead William brandom was dead now you you can't be dead be a new creation you I mean you know you got to be dead to be a new creation so you can't be still alive let me make sure say correct you can't still be alive and be a new creation that's right and we're talking about in the soul that's right not talking about your body and your spirit right it is not redeemed that's right so everybody thinks that well why do I still have troubles I have all kind of problems well don't you think the Lord Jesus had all kind of problems and I didn't think we supposed to have problems we're Christian where' you get that that's right but being a Christian is the problem we are in spirit realm a new creation living in a natural realm in a human body that's right amen dealing with people that are of totally another creation that's right right it's bad enough just dealing with ourselves right PA said the things I would not I did I just told more but we're living in a world where 9 99.9% of the world is lost that's right they're of that old creation that old life that's right good people a lot of them that's natures and ways but they're not a part of this new race am why you have troubles that's right that's what brother R said in this creation he said our women don't cut their heart they don't Bight their don't put on back up that why cuz it's a new race that's right well if you see people around here got on like I always tell you sometimes you want to go to your wife and go lick your thumb and go over her face if it comes off dark color she got something on there well I just put on a little bit I try to be honest about that and then it gets me in trouble if you got a birth mark on your face now I know this going to be this going to get it people out there don't agree with it you got a birth mark on your face I don't see a thing in the world wrong with covering that birth mark up with makeup you ain't going to like that that's all right that's me but don't get spots on your face and try to cover them all up that's right I said a birk Mark that's right come on you make me say something I didn't say that's your lie that's right but my face is shiny it needs a little something to keep it from being too shiny well why don't you go rub some mud on you I sure stop it amen what I do I put my make up okay all right get off go ahead but listen Church we're supposed to be a new creation amen right what would God do I like that little thing they were you know the W whatever all on then what would God do and what would Jesus Christ do he said you don't never have no troubles hey I am trouble that's said that's what to say but I'm trying to get rid of myself and I have a lot of trouble doing it so you pray for me but I'm trying my best to get you and I to help each one of us amen that we can see Jesus Christ amen and not preach to you some kind of a gospel that you can never attain unto that's right see I believe it can be done all right but listen to what the prophet had to say now look at the lady you see in church age this is paragraph 117 but is preached 1960 12 11 the evening service to show that he was the first also he was he's the beginning of the creation of God oh do you catch it see how could he be created if he's a spirit how could he be he he's Eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was God at the beginning that's right but he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest that's it when God lived in him he is God's creation oh my see the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation of God when God created himself a body he come down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of God oh isn't he wonderful amen to the beginning of the creation of God and you know that when he was theophine and come forth from God logos or what you want to call it to create the world it was a new creation behold all things are made new all right he created a people Genesis 1:26 and 27 In His Image cuz he was a new creation but then he had to wait 6,000 I mean 4,000 years before he could bring that Genesis 126 and 27 man into being on the day of Pentecost in The Bride of Jesus Christ to separate himself among a group of people that we would be a new race a new people all right see but it would be Jesus Christ I hope you keep getting that point cuz that was what I want you to see yes that we were in had to be in him the only way we can have anything that's right is for us to be in him amen and that part of us that was in him is what the eternal life that we have not physically we were in him no you see a new creation then means it's got to be more we'll get down to read this on down a little further message why had to be Shepherds 1964 12-21 uh paragraph 98 he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself that just leaves us totally out don't it that's what people don't like I don't like you tell it like it is oh but I've got to have something to do with it I've got to do you know TR be no it's just it's a creation of himself the Born Again believer is God made manifest that's right in a human body amen and God is pleased to dwell that's one of those scriptures see River Jordan he was pleased to dwell in Jesus right he's pleased to dwell in you if he gives you the new birth right I just can't seee pleas to dwell in me you don't believe what the Bible says that's true all right he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwell Among Us that's the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel well God With Us he built himself a house to live in so that he could reflect his word to his subjects through that you know what God is when you see Christ all right now so he created a natural body and came to live in it right on the day of Pentecost he started a new creation by the new birth that he could come and live in us now what's he doing he's creating a was another body not a different body he's creating us right right he created a body he had to start in Us by created a spiritual form first right you couldn't come down and say cus you're the great you you're the high priest I I'll just make you a new creation no he wouldn't have it he killed the very one that brought it that's right but you see he started on the inside to work outwardly Amen to build a body that he could live in that's what's taking place today our problem is we don't yield it to him that's right H that's right I mean that's mine I don't know about you but that's my problem yes we'll get to it later on about the black dog white dog you know and the chief said back to me receive the Holy Ghost but he said which one win he says the one I feed the most well now you can't make the white dog and the black dog both of them in the same place that's right so you better make the white dog the Born Again experience and the black dog the outside of me that you're looking at now there's two people standing here there two dogs mhm but you see Church look what he's done look the next one proving his word 64816 paragraph 146 so he God came down after going through this and now ever son on that you eat and born of a natural sexual birth the way you come then when it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism then the Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims his creation the same as it did him all right he claimed his body there on the River Jordan that didn't make his body Eternal by the new birth didn't make our body Eternal right but it laid a claim on it right we're not going to get another one like I've tried to explain to people and how do you if you're going to get a new body you better have a new world somewhere created to get it from cuz if it comes from here it's going to be part of the old so you better run to Jupiter Mars on these Russians or the United States you got to meet couple of maybe 100 million you can ride up there and stay up there silly a same as it did him the Holy Ghost and God is the same Spirit see it comes down and claims his body for the resurrection he was raised for our justification all the one Higher the head will ever perish this is the beginning of the creation of God excuse me that is the beginning of the creation of God this is the continuation of the creation of God you and I are the continuation you said we've read this many time I agree we will probably read some more too until we get it we're not a different creation we can't be a different creation right we got to be the same creation that's right all right cuz we're a different creation we'd be a new creation right different all right follow me then the whole earth has to have a baptism see it's going to be made Eternal and the Holy Ghost comes down in a city to dwell upon the earth and the Tabernacle of God is with man and dwells with them God has Tabernacle here on the earth this whole Redemption plan justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the same as it is as it is then now are you thinking New Creation super race he calls them the church H book super race different from the old race cuz now we have with the inside of us the life of God right makes us A different race of people amen it's like who was it if I quote it wrong get one but one of the Great Men down through time might have been Luther one of them walking down the street one day and and he asked this guy excuse me let us pass and man said I don't step aside for a fool he said always do step down the street walk around one of them different race but can we do do that can we do that to be A different race now for a minute I want to try to explain something cuz this means a lot to me into seeing a new creation new race and it destroys what most people in the message the way they preach you know that most people preach that Eve is a byproduct you've heard it right he just hamburg meat compared to us Porter House steaks men you know he's a byproduct and they'll only quote the things brother brandham says that leans it the way they want it to be leaned all right but you know Eve they quot a lot that she was not in the original creation but brother Ram said she was in the original creation right cuz she was in Adam the same one they want to quote from see they to down her and I know what brother Brown is doing I got it for this evening I may repeat this again I know what he's doing when he's talking about a by front up in one stage of what he's talking about he's giv her the greatest place that could ever be that she was not taken not like the other animals that she was in that's right because he said we was in Jesus Christ right you don't never hear that side preached the only preaching that she's a by product meaning she's not an original creation but now where was she at I know what he's saying he was not made physically when Adam was made physically that's right you know two people standing there two bodies one Adam one e she wasn't made that that's right but when Adam was created she was in Adam that's right is that true yes he didn't go out and get another pile of dirt and blow it together and make an eve out of it he went back to the original creation amen right cuz she was in Adam in that original creation that's right see at one time brother Ram is explaining the situation of how that by her coming to where she came that it made her with the possibility of being able to do wrong is that true all making her with the possibility because separating her right right I believe that and that way she's a by product but that's the way he's explaining her of the reason sin could enter the picture right but on the other hand he's explaining her as the wonderful beautiful bride of Adam right that's right that was not another creation that he had to go over somewhere else get him a wife bring over she's part of him that's right amen you don't hear that preached she's only condemning the woman they don't even go look up the word by product go look it up you go down here now and you can buy you a brand new what is it 50 something model Ford when is that Thunderbird or whatever it was 60 something or 50 something Ford you can buy you a brand new one you know what it is it's a byproduct right that old Ford that was back there you don't even look up the word byproduct well bless God I know what it means it means go down dirty rotten sticking something where do you get it at the word byproduct means of equal value or great Torah you don't hear that do you brother I don't like you because you you you you you take up for the women I don't take up for women I take up for the bride of Christ they ain't nothing in the world no dirtier than a garbage Canin woman unless he'd be a garbage can man right right cuz remember he could have put her away he could have refused to took her the Bible doesn't say in Eve all die it's in Adam right amen Adam had a right to do what he could do we don't blame the woman this blame us all but get the point now yes on one side brother Brandon will be explaining the great beautiful position that Eve was in as to coming from Adam and not coming from another creation like the other animals had done and then another situation which is basically when he gets on over towards marriage and divorce and he's explaining them how that she was made to where she could fall and he calls her a byproduct you don't never read the message well bless God I just know it's a by product that's all it is see you won't study the message you won't compare the things brother R said the woman on one side is the most filthiest garbage can could ever be he said but on the other side she is a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ the most beautiful thing that could ever be which way you going to use it well bless God I'll use the way I want to go the hand cuz it ain't going to change that's but see when you face somebody like me you're going to have to face it one day cuz one day you'll hear this sermon again if you keep on with your ideas of of how that byproduct is just a garbage can and not see that it's the most wonderful beautiful thing that could ever be that God never went somewhere else and got something to make Eve out of he went right into his original creation that's right amen that's right and I thought come on I thought that a man and wife was a type of Christ in the church that's right I didn't know man and a garbage can you know what a man in the garbage can's got two garbage cans you we're not talking silly talking straight you would follow me about the new creation but you see this is laying a foundation to understand how these bodies can be changed that's what I'm doing all right I'm talking about a change of the body but see to look at it in the original then you see Adam and Eve was the same DNA right you going to argue the point come on what would it be come on we got a couple of nurses sitting here if Eve come out of Adam she's the same DNA as Adam right but all they got to find is a little old piece of bone or some kind of something they can get it all back but see her problem wasn't when she took somebody besides Adam right right right had it been that it was going to be natural multiplication from Adam and Eve you argue that I'm not even never worried about it cuz it it didn't happen anyway but had it being that there were going to be without sin you know that we would all come with the same DNA because Adam and Eve had the same DNA what are you going to make it oh on you get into all these technical points of this that get into all the technical points do all you want to with it but you know what I'm talking about the truth but see where the problem was is when Eve mixed and brought forth another DNA right right and that started all of this mess up in the DNA because we would have all been the same DNA we would have all been the same blood type we would have all been the same and it not been a fault you don't think sensible explain something else to deid that to be the truth so Eve was a part of Adam the Bible says she is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh brother random said she was Body Spirit and show a part of Adam okay so now we're talking about a new creation to Adam was a natural New Creation it was the beginning of the human race right and Eve wasn't made a byproduct to take AP part of the dirt maker like the other animals so we only deal man the preachers only deal with trying to make her some garbage can to prove Show sex or whatever this is and and whatever do they don't go to the point of seeing who she really was I don't understand all about it no claim to but brother Maloney said the Greek Bears out that a woman means a man with a wound w m b wound to reproduce himself Eve was not given to reproduce Eve she was given to reproduce Adam right she was not to bring forth hers that's where she messed it up New Creation let me get in a hurry I'll be glad to give you these let's go with the first one Brothers we'll get one or two and then you can have the rest of these I'll copy them off for you if you want but go to the marriage of the Lamb number six paragraph 10862 121 e now look it's so perfect that when God took took and made a man and to show that he did not want it out of anything different the woman was not in the original creation so she is not in the creation what but she's a part of Adam she's a byproduct he goes into the side of Adam not to make another creature but taking part of a creature and make another creature out of it he took the and he took the masculine spirit that was in Adam and he took the feminine spirit that was in Adam rather and put it over into the woman so both spirit and body they become one now if you don't agree with that then you better annihilate the rest of this down below here you better race this off okay take that off if you don't agree why said it was a beautiful type to what God did at Calvary he took Christ and connected him with the church through a Riven side he brought the blood that cleansed the person that sanctifies the Flesh of the church and puts the spirit of the Living God and he took of the Cross off the cross there out of Christ and puts it into the individual then they are one they become one Christ and you are one amen now don't sound like he was too dirty look at the next Masterpiece 64 paragraph 101 64 705 let us not forget that in the beginning that when he smoked the side of Adam he took something from this side now the spining of Christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride he might take him a bride so when the Masterpiece was perfected then he had to Smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation you say amen I agree with that that's that we're part of God he's explaining what happened with Adam and Eve right my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute if he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of the original creation then if he was a word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God in the word amen right jump down to let's go to number eight brothers but we'll drop down to paragraph 829 up the one where's questions and answers 57 106 we go down to where it says paragraph 829 because I'm trying to cut it short okay and Adam was lonesome and God to show that they could not be separated now I'm going to get back into this same thing just a second look he never went and got dirt and made an eve but he made from the original dirt Adam he took a rib from his side and made him a helpmate and that was Eve she was made for the man and part of the man she was a part of him in the beginning and the creation in the ofing are you reading she was in him in theophany she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided into another creation she had to be be made in the same creation he said because that's the same thing about the other let's see if I can find the other one but she would part of him in theophany look at the next one questions and answers number nine brother uh 639 God in the beginning when he know that man and woman was made one not two they were made one they were separated one put in flesh and one under theophany okay he knew that so in order to prove that to you when God made the woman he never took some of some took some dust and made her like he did the man he took a rib out of the side of Adam and she become a byproduct of a man because she's part of him you get it now so Eve was Body Spirit and soul a part of Adam you said well you're saying Soul well theophany you know how I've always preached it when he put her in flesh she had to have her own soul CU she would have it wouldn't have been Eve so he gave her body spirit and soul but do you think Adam is the only one that had eternal life we can prove Adam had eternal life right blackmans night but what about Eve brother Rand W marriage and divorce he said if you get a revelation that that is your wife he said that's your wife for life he said not watch some drunken magistrate joined together he say but if you get a revelation and how you going to get a revelation by the new birth right and the new birth then is going to make us all one that's why Genesis 1 26 and 27 is just one Soul one theoy an ever born again Believer by the new birth that's the life of God right and by having the life of God our soul is our theop then amen but all brother it's up you some words that's the positive of God's mind that's just like the new birth down at the bottom of the pyramid when you're right here at the new birth God believes and shows you're going to be up here he keeps pulling on you that's right it's drawing you amen but see Eve was in Adam not another creation like I said then I'll repeat it where people understand in one case brother Brandon will be explaining Eve as the most beautiful part of Adam that even in Theo in theop and I gave you the quote there where he said part of Adam was still in theophany where was it at was up in you know was it was Eve and it Eve was in Adam and theop but see on the other hand he'll explain how dirty she is and how that she was not an original creation because none of the original creation could fall the dog can't fall the horse can't fall the animals can't fall they're just for reproduction right but the woman is a human sexual garbage can but she's also a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ so which one we going to make it are you listening New Creation we're a new creation by the new birth that's right Adam was a creation Eve was in Adam Adam Eve was taken from Adam a part of the original creation that's right wonderful position you sisters have a wonderful place because you are a type of the bride of Christ live it and walk it but see you can be the type of the most gar most filthy garbage Canin that's ever been on so you have a choice you have a choice to be what you want to be we have a choice to be a new creature in Christ Jesus we can die out to ourselves and become born again and then we realize if we have eternal life then that eternal life never had a beginning so then if that eternal life never had a beginning then the eternal life that I have now in my soul is a part of God Amen and always was a part of God the Eternal life that I have cuz he's made me a new creation amen we were all the natural creation by birth right but by a new birth we become the spiritual creation the body of Jesus Christ a body thou Hast prepared me what just talking about Jesus the body he's talking about you and I cuz we're his body we have the opportunity to die to ourselves and accept Jesus Christ as our savior and become part of this new creation or we can go on with our mental attitude and stay lost why is it that I said the other day that that people do what the Bible says but God don't save them the Bible says if you believe in your heart confess with your mouth you're saved that's good bapst theology but it's the Bible which is true and if you're really right about it sincere you're going to be saved right but not just because everybody says it that's right right cuz this is a new race of people what about an opportunity to be of a new race you know what I think about I used to as a young man I used to think about oh it would be nice you know to inherit maybe a100 million doar you know and I could buy this and buy that and build a new church and we can have this we can do it I just go through and my mind just runs all the time like yeah I know yours don't but that's just mine you know just runs all the time you know and just you know and uh but you know what I was thinking the other day I thought what would I do if I had $100 million I don't really care what go sister G I mean somebody just come along and give you $100 million it wouldn't change thing would it it wouldn't make a r will go out no you could go down the house took out but they're still there it wouldn't change a thing you know what maybe one of these days we'll understand what Paul said he had come to a place that he said whatever state that I'm in there are to be content right that don't mean New York or Georgia either that's your spiritual condition to own the whole world lose your soul come on brother wouldn't be worth nothing what good would money do I just give it away you know why I give it away cuz I know it ain't going to last long it wouldn't matter because I a go life long you know but what it matter well we get to realize we're a new creature yes and realizing the reality today's a possibility you know what this message brought to me a possibility that my body could be changed thank you Lord a possibility that I'd get to see my savior a possibility that I could live eternally then who'd worry about millions of dollars but I'm just like brother brandom you know brother brand said if you knew what you had in your pocket you take it out and burn it right you know that quote M but now did he do it no no he didn't do it you know Reas he did didn't do it cuz we're human we got to have the stuff while we here you know they say the dirtiest thing in the world is money cuz how many hand just went through and all that's rubbed off but you just bring me all you want to and pile it up here I'll get rid of the dirty stuff far you see cuz we're human brother Rand was a human he told it like it was but it was a human being that lived he was a new creature he said I found out that I'm not the son of Charles and El brandham I'm a Child of God right a new creation let's stand what we got 16 just sing a verse or so we quit for L okay anybody have a need oh oh my heart oh saor oh my I pr we all problem we don't want but you know that's what's Mak what you are your trouble and then we real Pro you heard our he promises they never be anything put on us that we would not be because you said you that you would give us the ability to overcome so then they can't anything stop us we just let our sister realize that know that Satan is doing everything he can to hinder why would he be try to hindery Lord from your side see ourselves Lord just give our sister the blessing within our heart you look at it see Lord say thank you Lord for the test and the trial and I'm going pro give me ability to overcome promise we love you we thank you in Jesus believe Jesus oh Ser me oh God and know my heart might oh one all about think about it we're a new creature a different people I know some of you have from other countries and come here and have to adapt and change to our uh ways of being see that's that's what we're doing adap into God's word you see really are most wonderful opportunity to think about the right of Jesus Christ where're his bre him made manifest we own all of this everything is mine oh man that didn't work one day I said the Bible said
