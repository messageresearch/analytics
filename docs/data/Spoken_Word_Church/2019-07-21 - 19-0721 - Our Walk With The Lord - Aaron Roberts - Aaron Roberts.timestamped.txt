[0:13] [Music]
[0:25] from the
[0:31] chapter 24 yes
[0:49] [Music]
[0:50] well that's Richard by the life drug can
[0:53] I started versatile
[1:08] [Music]
[1:13] when you hear important
[1:17] Mar I made 24 last chapter of the
[1:22] Boogaloo first verse
[1:24] yes
[1:27] [Music]
[1:35] so Luke chapter 24 verse one says now
[1:39] upon the first day of the week very
[1:41] early in the morning they came under the
[1:43] Sepulcher bringing the spices which they
[1:45] had prepared and certain others with
[1:47] meal and they found the stone rolled
[1:49] away from the sepulchre and they entered
[1:52] him he found out the body of the Lord
[1:55] Jesus and it came to pass as they were
[1:58] much perplexed thereabout the whole
[2:00] three men stood by them in shining
[2:02] garments and as they were afraid and
[2:05] bowed down their faces to the earth they
[2:08] said unto them why seek to you the
[2:10] living among the dead he is not here but
[2:12] it's risen remember how he spake unto
[2:15] you when he was yet in Galilee saying
[2:17] the Son of Man must be delivered into
[2:19] the hands of sinful men and be crucified
[2:21] and the third day rise again and they
[2:25] remember his words and returned from the
[2:27] Sepulcher and come all these things done
[2:29] to the eleven and to all the rest so
[2:33] that just were we're finished in them
[2:35] later on we'll probably bring some more
[2:37] of this chapter
[2:41] this is a one of my one of my favorite
[2:44] scriptures in the in the Bible first
[2:48] verse thinkness is and they remembered
[2:50] his words I've always always found that
[2:55] fascinating in in our life especially my
[3:03] Christian journey I'm finding myself in
[3:05] the same position but the thing reality
[3:08] and as you go through this this host
[3:11] scripture because this chapter right
[3:13] here later on we'll get to it later on
[3:17] in this chapter is the two going on the
[3:19] road to Emmaus and you know it always
[3:22] always amazes me that you know here's a
[3:27] group of people that that walk with
[3:29] Jesus you know for three and a half
[3:32] years and all the things that they have
[3:33] been through and all the things that
[3:35] they had solved and you know the Angels
[3:39] come and tell them that Jesus : said you
[3:43] know destroy this temple in three days
[3:44] I'll race it here and he tells him what
[3:47] he come to do you know because he come I
[3:51] come to seek and save those which were
[3:53] lost and he knew they told me said he'll
[3:57] I'll be turned over into the hands of
[3:59] sinful men but you I will rise again you
[4:01] know he kept telling what he came from
[4:03] when he comes to do over and over he and
[4:05] they kept seeing all the things that you
[4:07] know in it every time that Steven when
[4:09] he was challenged by the Pharisees and
[4:11] the Sadducees he took them back to the
[4:12] scripture and say search the scriptures
[4:15] are these not the things that the
[4:18] prophets wrote about that I would do
[4:20] they said I'm not doing he said if if I
[4:23] don't do these things then you can come
[4:25] me over but if I don't then you're
[4:27] supposed to believe what the scripture
[4:30] says and I've come to do that and you
[4:32] know it's so amazing is because many
[4:34] times in our lives we seek things happen
[4:37] and we see and God moves them on the
[4:41] scene and you know what we still have
[4:43] our
[4:43] thing brother em says in one place he
[4:46] says you know we're supposed to purge
[4:48] our thinking and one of the one of the
[4:52] reasons why I wanted to get into this
[4:54] today was I was listening I know brother
[4:57] Joe was was in that was in the Army and
[5:00] he came probably tell us a lot more
[5:03] about it than I can but how's this
[5:05] another young man give us give this
[5:09] testimony about being in the military
[5:11] and the different things of the event
[5:13] three but it one thing you tell about
[5:14] this you know in basic training the one
[5:17] thing that they want you to do is get
[5:18] away from your way of thinking and one
[5:21] of the things that you have to change is
[5:23] the way you talk he said the first thing
[5:28] you do is you don't say me you don't say
[5:31] i you don't say my you don't say mine
[5:37] you don't own nothing they owe you and
[5:44] you know the thing gives us you know and
[5:46] what struggling with shoes listening to
[5:48] them well you know we are we're supposed
[5:49] to be an invincible army well you know
[5:53] what
[5:53] we're we don't own our singers I'm not
[5:56] my own not belong to Jesus he purchased
[5:59] me I'm obvious as the song goes so we've
[6:03] been bought with a price well you know
[6:04] we shouldn't have our own thing
[6:06] well this young man was talking about
[6:09] you know the first time that they were
[6:10] you know you have to do certain things
[6:12] and you know becoming their first thing
[6:15] he said was mild you know and then all
[6:18] of a sudden he said the drill sergeant
[6:20] was in his face and started screaming at
[6:22] him and he kept making him say this
[6:24] recruit this recruit this recruit he
[6:27] keeps saying that over and over and over
[6:29] why because he had to get away from
[6:30] saying I me my mine had to be this
[6:35] recruit and you know one of the other
[6:37] things that he talked about was that
[6:40] when we when you go in
[6:45] you know everybody it's one group it's a
[6:49] it's a it's a platoon a squad a company
[6:53] whatever it is you know there's a
[6:56] there's a group of people that are
[6:58] together and you all win and you all
[7:00] lose together and it was when one
[7:06] soldier he wanted to do his own thing
[7:09] and you know he's able to show off and
[7:11] then try to be his own and the first
[7:13] thing that drill started talking oh you
[7:15] want to be an individual you want to be
[7:17] an individual and you know there's a
[7:22] there's a movie that was made many years
[7:26] ago and some of you might have seen it
[7:30] but never heard of it but it's called
[7:33] Full Metal Jacket and there's a scene in
[7:36] there where this again one of the young
[7:39] men and the Marines think it's called a
[7:42] food and you know one of the rules about
[7:44] eating is you eat when they Kennedy you
[7:47] don't eat any other time of your food
[7:48] does not mix you go for food three of
[7:51] them the cafeteria or wherever a nudey
[7:54] are you even in the field and when you
[7:56] get done when they say you're done
[7:57] there's no more food you don't carry and
[7:59] they get scuffle and it's
[8:01] conclude this footlocker well you know
[8:03] the one thing that happens is the rest
[8:06] of the guys in the group are down there
[8:08] doing exercises and push-ups and
[8:11] everything and the drill sergeant gives
[8:13] the guy that had the doughnut gives him
[8:15] the doughnut and says well you know
[8:17] they're paying for it you eat it and he
[8:19] has to stand there in front of everybody
[8:21] and all the other guys are on the floor
[8:22] doing push-ups and he's sitting there
[8:24] eating that doughnut and you're one of
[8:27] these he was so much you know we win and
[8:28] loose together and you know we're
[8:31] nobodies enough out of nobody's father
[8:33] say to me how if we think we do this by
[8:36] yourself but really
[8:37] no but you know I'm singing about you
[8:41] know if we overcome we overcome because
[8:44] it is an overcoming as a personal
[8:46] overcoming but you know what it's a it's
[8:47] brother branham said that if if we just
[8:52] believe if we do something wrong so we
[8:54] can call the church to fail and you know
[8:58] so yeah it is a personal overcoming
[9:01] because when you go through the army or
[9:04] whatever you're doing for the joke you
[9:06] think you know it's you have to do it
[9:08] all by yourself because you don't nobody
[9:12] else is on the firing range when you're
[9:13] firing your weapon to qualify that's you
[9:16] you have to qualify and you know but
[9:19] ever but you have to think about you
[9:24] know I'm doing this not just for myself
[9:26] but I'm doing this for everybody
[9:29] everybody's included in this and you
[9:31] know and so you know if we if we look at
[9:35] it it all has to all has to come back to
[9:38] be a personal but it has to be then
[9:40] we're doing this as a group you know
[9:43] that was riding down the road that was
[9:45] thinking you know
[9:46] [Music]
[9:49] you know I could count the number of
[9:51] times that people's come on my heart and
[9:53] you just pray for somebody and it may be
[9:55] a quick prayer sometimes somebody's on
[9:57] your mind the whole day and you pray
[9:59] about if you pray over somebody you
[10:01] don't even know what they're going for
[10:02] you don't know situation sometimes you
[10:04] find out there is a situation that
[10:06] they're going through sometimes you pray
[10:07] for and then somebody comes back and
[10:09] says you know I've been dealing with
[10:11] this or whatever you know
[10:13] years ago I had a business many years
[10:17] ago his young sister she was on my heart
[10:19] and for some reason I woke up and she
[10:22] was on my mind I was praying I prayed
[10:24] all day long and it was just I just
[10:27] could never get rid of this feeling that
[10:29] I had you know it was just a real burden
[10:31] well then after I come back from work
[10:35] Betty I called her on the phone and I
[10:38] asked her I said are you okay or what's
[10:40] going on and she told me about some
[10:42] personal things that she had been going
[10:43] through and she said she didn't know
[10:46] what to do that she was really trying to
[10:49] seek God for an answer
[10:50] on what to do and I was like you know I
[10:52] just want you know I've been praying and
[10:55] she was so amazed that God had cut
[10:57] somebody and but somebody was on the
[11:00] other end thinking of her that somebody
[11:03] was killed many times we think we were
[11:05] so by ourselves and you know sometimes
[11:07] it's so amazing that somebody comes
[11:08] along and they think hey I've been
[11:09] prayin for you and sometimes you know we
[11:12] don't we could sit down and look into
[11:14] this other room and see how many times
[11:16] we've been prayed for about other people
[11:19] [Music]
[11:20] you know I always tell everybody that
[11:24] where I am where I am today because I
[11:28] had a friend grandmother
[11:31] that she really kept us before God and
[11:34] you know I'd make dogs for them because
[11:38] it really you know all the know that I
[11:41] do and all that I'm able to accomplish I
[11:45] always say to put health of her prayer
[11:48] and if I have less than anybody will it
[11:51] goes back to her because she she was
[11:53] wanted stood behind us to bring us to
[11:56] this place
[11:56] hey brother I'm talked about you know
[11:58] all the ones that went before us
[12:00] you know payment away you know you know
[12:02] we're walking the trails that they think
[12:05] blazed that they think you know so you
[12:08] know it's not anybody being by their
[12:10] self or or any you know you don't
[12:12] accomplish it all by yourself
[12:15] because lots of times you said well you
[12:17] know what I get load is there's somebody
[12:19] praying for me you know brother Dale
[12:23] talks about many times where he talks
[12:24] about you know waking up the middle the
[12:26] night praying for everybody in the
[12:27] church and you know it's it's amazing
[12:31] that but you know because somebody is
[12:33] praying on your behalf and somebody is
[12:36] uplifting you and you know sometimes we
[12:39] think what we're doing all by ourselves
[12:40] and we you know it's nobody but nobody's
[12:44] in our and you know become even even
[12:49] when you're by yourself and and you feel
[12:52] like you're you're fighting this battle
[12:54] all alone
[12:55] but you know there's one that said I'll
[12:58] never leave you I'll never forsake he
[13:01] said I'll be we even eating you to the
[13:03] end of the
[13:04] you're not you're never alone you're
[13:07] never you never fight the battle by your
[13:09] seat many times sometimes what happens
[13:12] this is we want to do things and try to
[13:14] accomplish things and we think we can
[13:16] figure it out on our own and lots of
[13:18] times the Lord standing there waiting on
[13:19] us to expend our wheels enough do we get
[13:21] aggravated and tired of what we're doing
[13:23] and then he's like would you like for me
[13:25] the hill it's like get a week save
[13:29] ourselves a lot of heartache in trouble
[13:31] that we just go that way than begin with
[13:34] but sometimes we we have this thinking
[13:37] so that we can accomplish them and you
[13:41] know here in the here in the scripture
[13:43] you know they hear hear these people are
[13:46] walking with Jesus and Jesus walk with
[13:48] them all of this way thanks and
[13:50] expounding the scriptures this whole way
[13:57] here
[13:59] sometimes we don't kiss because I don't
[14:04] but I don't think no matter what Jesus
[14:05] tried to tell them about the truth you
[14:07] know I don't you know we don't know
[14:09] their their thought process this is just
[14:11] kind of my thinking but you know they
[14:14] probably sing crucifixions before
[14:16] because it was a Roman penalty so it's
[14:20] probably something they sing before but
[14:23] you know when it's somebody that you
[14:25] love it is something different but no
[14:28] matter what Jesus trying to tell them
[14:30] what was going to take place and maybe
[14:32] they didn't maybe they just never caught
[14:34] the grasp of that you know you're like
[14:37] in you know you go through terrible
[14:39] things and you're in shock and you're in
[14:42] this minute here in this topsy-turvy
[14:45] world and you're trying to figure things
[14:47] out and Jesus don't say this is gonna
[14:51] happen to me but on race in three days
[14:56] you know and here's the same one thing
[14:59] you know that kept telling me you when
[15:03] you see this this man uh who've done all
[15:05] these great miracles you know there
[15:08] never was a funeral procession that he
[15:09] didn't ranks the data he took he took a
[15:13] boy's lunch and he fed 5,000 he walked
[15:17] on the water all the great miracles that
[15:20] this man had done and you know what if
[15:22] he could do that then it couldn't he
[15:25] couldn't be raised from the dead
[15:27] well that's what the Old Testament
[15:29] prophets said he would do
[15:30] that's what was testified in the Old
[15:32] Testament and then they come and testify
[15:33] to the same thing and yet here they come
[15:37] on the third date which is the day that
[15:40] he has folks to raise and they go to the
[15:44] sepulchre with their spices and with
[15:47] during all of their
[15:50] instruments and and elder spices and in
[15:53] bowls or whatever the linen whatever
[15:55] leaders I go then you know annoying the
[15:58] body preparing for death and they're so
[16:03] amazed that when he comes to he says ycq
[16:05] little of what angels come and say ycq
[16:07] the living among the dead
[16:09] why are you why are you here
[16:11] they did not tell you that he would do
[16:13] these things you know there's people
[16:16] time you know I've had times in my life
[16:19] you know we pray over things a week God
[16:21] to move in and when he does you know we
[16:23] were shocked that he moved well that's
[16:27] why if you pray for something to hurt
[16:29] for God to hit you when you do then
[16:31] you're taking back that it happened why
[16:34] because if you he said it the law he set
[16:38] up in the law of this word that if you
[16:41] believe and ask that he would do it well
[16:45] it's just like you know just like the
[16:47] law of gravity you throw something up it
[16:49] falls down well if you have the faith to
[16:51] believe in what he said you've confessed
[16:54] him bleep he's obligated to bring it to
[16:56] pass then it's not something that we
[16:59] have to you know we get worked up you
[17:01] know shocked at God healed me or God met
[17:04] my needs why because he said he would
[17:06] [Music]
[17:08] see it's our thinking that you know you
[17:11] know where we're trying to hedge our
[17:12] bets sometimes we think well you know
[17:14] what what's my second playing go me that
[17:16] God's not going to make the first well
[17:19] you know money if you are all sold out
[17:21] on the first one you would have to worry
[17:22] about trying to make the back-up plan
[17:23] why because there isn't a back-up plan
[17:25] with you I wouldn't you know I would
[17:29] much rather have all my hold my eggs and
[17:31] all my hoax in him did then try to come
[17:33] up with something else you know that
[17:36] that sister that was in the the message
[17:40] letting off the pressure you know
[17:41] brother-n-law thoughts about how she was
[17:43] such an older lady but she looks Tanya
[17:46] and he asked her sister woods
[17:48] what's your secret and what is it that
[17:51] makes you look so young and she had
[17:53] grown children he said you could believe
[17:55] could believe that she was that old it
[17:56] was like well when I first become a
[17:58] Christian it's like I knew I put all my
[18:01] hooks in him and he said he'd take care
[18:03] of me and said if he can take care of it
[18:06] I certainly can't so I'm not gonna worry
[18:08] but I just I got nothing to worry about
[18:11] why because when I give it all name and
[18:16] it's the same way with us that we don't
[18:18] have to worry about
[18:20] there's no thirst shouldn't be any worry
[18:23] we shouldn't have to try to figure
[18:26] things that one because he's someone
[18:28] this guy that I think you're back
[18:29] we just need to rest in him but as as
[18:34] these two and see the women went to to
[18:38] the Sepulcher and they found these two
[18:42] these two angels at the Sepulcher and
[18:45] they and they totally so why seeking the
[18:47] living among the dead he's not here but
[18:51] remember what he said it says and they
[18:53] remembered his words you know that's the
[18:57] reason that we only keep her always stay
[19:01] in the work I always state what the word
[19:04] says confess the word always have your
[19:07] mind on in the world because if we stay
[19:12] with that then we can't as brother have
[19:16] said we've heard earthly you know what
[19:19] if we think what he thinks if we think
[19:22] the word and work then we purge our
[19:24] father's we overcome our thoughts with
[19:27] this stuff we replace our thoughts will
[19:29] get stars and it's so amazing that that
[19:32] they go down this road and all of a
[19:35] sudden it's like oh yeah
[19:36] he said he'd raised today in England
[19:39] Ernie said well his body's not here so
[19:42] he's risen from the dead because the
[19:43] Angels have told us he's not here he's
[19:45] risen from the dead and all of a sudden
[19:48] here they go back to testify that he's
[19:50] risen from the dead and as he go how
[19:53] they go to tell the ulema ninh and them
[19:56] as he's risen from the dead and
[20:01] this is into all the rest at verse verse
[20:05] 10 says that it was Mary Magdalene and
[20:08] Joanna and Mary the mother of James and
[20:12] other women that were there with him
[20:14] which told these things unto the
[20:16] Apostles and their words seemed to be as
[20:19] Bible tales and they believed them up
[20:22] then a roast Peter and rent under the
[20:24] sepulchre and stooping down people held
[20:27] the linen clothes laid by themselves and
[20:30] departed wondering in himself at that
[20:32] which was come to pass so we know that
[20:38] when they heard it they didn't believe
[20:41] what then what was told because here
[20:45] though they come back and said jesus
[20:48] said I'll race from the dead that he had
[20:50] risen from the dead because the angels
[20:52] are here they told us and they didn't
[20:54] believe it and Peter and John runs back
[20:56] to the simple courtesy to find out if it
[20:59] was really true because they'd already
[21:01] heard the testimony that he was there he
[21:03] was he was gone he was risen it's empty
[21:06] but they had to go see for themselves
[21:08] and they ran back to see it now because
[21:15] they didn't believe what was said in
[21:16] this system and behold two of them went
[21:20] out that same day to a village called
[21:22] Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about
[21:25] three score furlongs and they talked
[21:28] together of all these things which had
[21:31] happened and it came to pass that well
[21:33] they commute together and reason Jesus
[21:39] himself drew near
[21:40] and went with them since with their
[21:44] house were holding that they should not
[21:47] know him
[21:48] [Music]
[21:53] and it's then he said that to them what
[21:56] manner of communications are these that
[22:02] he should not that you should have one
[22:06] to another as you won't in our set and
[22:09] the one of the old who's nameless
[22:11] Cleophus answering set at him bar though
[22:14] only a stranger in Jerusalem the past
[22:16] number known the things which are come
[22:19] to pass the pass there in these days and
[22:24] he said unto them what things and they
[22:26] said unto Him concerning Jesus of
[22:28] Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in
[22:31] deed and word before God and all the
[22:34] people in how the chief priests and our
[22:36] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[22:39] death and have crucified Him but we
[22:41] trusted that it had been he which would
[22:44] have redeemed Israel and besides all
[22:47] this today is the third day since these
[22:50] things were done yay and certain women
[22:53] also of our company made us astonished
[22:57] which were early at the sepulchre and
[23:00] when they found not his body they came
[23:02] saying that they had also seen a vision
[23:06] of angels which said that he was alive
[23:09] and certain of them which were whipped
[23:12] us men to the sepulchre and found it
[23:14] even so as the women had said that him
[23:17] they saw not
[23:20] [Applause]
[23:22] so it was pretty amazing that you know
[23:25] of all the things that they have been
[23:27] through and solved and then the women
[23:30] went to the sepulchre and came back and
[23:33] told him that he had risen that it was
[23:35] him and then Cleophus and his friend
[23:40] they tell Jesus that there were others
[23:44] with us that went to the sepulchre and
[23:47] found it and came back so not only did
[23:50] we have the first group of witnesses but
[23:52] we had the second group of witnesses to
[23:55] tell us the same thing that he was risen
[23:56] from the dead and they came back and
[23:59] he's gone done it and found it just the
[24:01] way they said and yet here these are
[24:04] deciding to walk away and Jesus says why
[24:08] are you saying he said here you are
[24:12] you've heard everything that I've said
[24:14] but Jesus told you all the way through
[24:16] and you've seen these things and now
[24:18] you're standing you're walking away and
[24:21] they're in this kind of condition and
[24:27] [Music]
[24:29] Jesus speaks to them and tells them and
[24:33] verse 25 and he said unto them both
[24:36] fools of slow heart to believe all that
[24:38] the prophets have spoken follow not
[24:41] Christ to have suffered these things and
[24:42] to enter into his glory and beginning at
[24:46] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[24:48] unto them all the Scriptures the things
[24:51] concerning himself and they drew not
[24:53] unto the village where if they went and
[24:56] he made us no people would have gone
[24:59] further but they constrained him saying
[25:02] abide with us for it is toward evening
[25:04] and the day is far spent and he went in
[25:07] to tarry Whitfield and it came to pass
[25:09] as he said it meet with him he took
[25:11] bread and blessed it and brake and gave
[25:14] to them and their eyes were opened and
[25:16] they knew him and he vanished out of
[25:18] their sight and they said one to another
[25:20] did not our hearts burn within us while
[25:23] they talked with us by the way and while
[25:26] he opened to us the scriptures you know
[25:30] so it's so amazing them you know many
[25:33] times
[25:36] we wonder about people
[25:39] [Music]
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:45] see God do miracles you know they
[25:49] there's people that talk about you know
[25:51] oh I wish we could see the book of Acts
[25:53] take place er you know all these great
[25:55] things and you know what you're a
[25:57] miracle in yourself because you know
[26:01] many people they don't see that you are
[26:04] a walking there and you know here they
[26:07] hear they hear these men are all the
[26:09] things that they had seen it all that
[26:11] they had heard and yet they walk the way
[26:12] and here's Jesus speaking to me you know
[26:16] he it takes him back to the scripture
[26:19] and shows him all the things that they
[26:21] had seen and all that they had heard and
[26:23] yet and yet they couldn't believe what a
[26:26] place and then here Jesus began to
[26:30] expound and then when you know they
[26:34] pretended that he would that he would go
[26:36] on and they wanted him to stay with them
[26:38] and so you know he stayed and he and he
[26:40] broke the bread and they realized who
[26:42] that was
[26:44] you know it's the same way with you and
[26:46] I there's many times in our lives it you
[26:49] know we would look we were to see
[26:51] certain things that you know it's like
[26:52] oh how great everything was in the Bible
[26:54] Basin and in the book of Acts and
[26:57] everything but you know what you and I
[26:59] are mirrors and you know you and I we
[27:05] work miracles God works through us Amin
[27:10] times we don't realize what God is what
[27:11] God is used us to do because there's
[27:18] Thompson in my life and I know everybody
[27:20] probably had the same thing is you know
[27:23] some of there's been a question or
[27:25] there's been a situation that's come up
[27:27] in your life and you have spoke because
[27:31] there's there's been times where people
[27:32] people have asked me questions or
[27:34] certain things come up and you know I'm
[27:36] amazed at what things that come out of
[27:38] my mouth because of you know I have to
[27:40] stop they call that was good and you
[27:42] know what that was God speaking and we
[27:46] don't realize you know God can speak
[27:47] through you
[27:48] say wow I wish God would speak this well
[27:50] you know what sometimes we overlook the
[27:52] things when God actually uses us to do
[27:54] things because we don't actually put the
[27:57] thought into Gorillaz you know that was
[28:01] not speaking to us God is using me
[28:05] because you know if somebody is out or
[28:09] somebody is sick you know just like when
[28:13] brother Colley and the different ones
[28:15] that have been a have been out you know
[28:17] what it's a when you come to church and
[28:20] and people are not here you know what if
[28:23] it if it doesn't there's something wrong
[28:26] me but you know what if it bears on your
[28:28] heart and you know what it was so glad
[28:32] to see one brother colleague made it
[28:33] back and there's so many other ones but
[28:35] you know that are babbling things and
[28:37] you know what if you know because it's
[28:40] us as a body we have to be the ones to
[28:42] hold them up in prayer but you know it's
[28:45] it's that we can God can use us and God
[28:52] uses us when you have children and you
[28:58] know there's many times when you're
[28:59] raising children you know we don't
[29:04] always go about it the correct way or at
[29:07] least I don't because you know sometimes
[29:11] I don't know how you are but lots of
[29:14] times I feel like I do
[29:20] I know you know lately the bowel says
[29:25] lay hands suddenly aluminum you know
[29:34] thank you know there's sometimes you
[29:35] know you you honestly you wish that
[29:37] there was a way that you could beat
[29:39] sensing and you know and I honestly
[29:43] thank you in my lifetime I think my
[29:45] death
[29:46] thought that he could and I think he
[29:48] tried in certain times in our lives to
[29:50] try to beat sense Intimus I don't know
[29:53] if it really worked or not
[29:56] but you know you're you're what's so
[29:59] amazing is when you look back and you
[30:01] think you know you try to do the best
[30:03] that you can but you know what you're
[30:04] human then you fail and you know we
[30:07] don't always handle every situation
[30:08] correctly but you know what's so amazing
[30:11] is when your kids when they look at you
[30:15] and they say things about you to other
[30:17] people and they can tell when people
[30:19] come back and tell you what your kids
[30:21] said about you it's so amazing because
[30:24] you know we look at ourselves and as
[30:27] failures and how could you know what our
[30:29] kids don't see and you know sometimes we
[30:32] look at ourselves as failures but you
[30:34] know what argon doesn't see it like our
[30:36] Heavenly Father
[30:38] because you know he seeks a bigger
[30:40] picture many times we think well you
[30:43] know I I don't do this I can't do this
[30:44] and hinder that you know what it's what
[30:47] you do have being faithful to what the
[30:51] little pork God gives you to do that's
[30:52] the main thing are you faithful and what
[30:54] God's given you there's no matter how
[30:56] big there's a little bit is are we
[30:58] thankful in that here because it's you
[31:03] know not everybody's come to do the same
[31:05] thing we all can't do the same thing and
[31:08] that you know honestly there's a lot of
[31:10] things I wouldn't want to do I have I
[31:15] have the highest honor for pastors but I
[31:19] honestly me that's just not my calling
[31:23] and I think the Lord that that's not my
[31:25] calling but you know what that's a
[31:28] that's a harder for somebody to be a
[31:30] pastor and I think we've got one of the
[31:32] greatest pastors ever walk Shula but you
[31:35] know the thing is is that's a position
[31:38] that God because you have to be God
[31:40] makes a man for that position and you
[31:43] know you come to that place where you
[31:45] can you can be in the that place you
[31:48] know it doesn't matter you know we've
[31:50] always want to be the high positions but
[31:54] you don't think is it's you know if we
[31:58] are prayer warriors to pray the Bible
[32:02] says here to pray without ceasing you
[32:05] know it doesn't take I know some people
[32:08] can pray long times and and everything
[32:11] like that and not really the type person
[32:14] to do that but you know the thing is
[32:16] this to be to have communion with God
[32:19] give my my prayer comes in the truck up
[32:22] I get in the truck and there's nothing
[32:24] me and me and the and you know I I'm
[32:26] listening to either brother ran over
[32:28] there so you know somebody you're
[32:30] listening to music or something and you
[32:32] know and that's it's an atmosphere that
[32:34] I can commune with God and yep you know
[32:36] there's been times that God has spoke to
[32:38] me and you know it's to me it's nice to
[32:41] get out and go and just be by yourself
[32:44] and you know you have to set that time
[32:47] and do that and let God speak to you but
[32:52] you know thing is this Airways as well I
[32:54] don't I don't have a lot of money I
[32:56] can't do this but you know what you can
[32:57] pray and you know I want one time i sat
[33:02] down it and I just started listening
[33:04] because you know you people will pray
[33:06] say will you pray for me and you know
[33:09] you and you say yeah I'll pray for you
[33:12] and then you forget and then just like
[33:14] the Lord who wasn't that said what they
[33:16] wanted prayer and then you think look we
[33:19] and I just started writin down even
[33:20] people that didn't even ask for prayer I
[33:22] just started listening people that I
[33:24] knew that had needs and you just start
[33:25] listing and you know and then it's
[33:27] something that just he start putting
[33:29] because you know these are verbs and
[33:31] Lord these people need a touch from you
[33:33] and you start thinking of them and you
[33:34] keep praying over these things too you
[33:36] know it doesn't take a long time it's
[33:40] just something that you set them and set
[33:42] a second time to do that and you never
[33:46] in you'd be amazed at what God can do
[33:48] through people just by taking that
[33:50] little bit of time to pray for somebody
[33:52] and you know to have a have a work to
[33:56] say to somebody you know uh at work
[33:59] everybody asks me how I'm doing it you
[34:03] know because you you find people that
[34:05] they don't have the Lord and you know
[34:08] whatever situations they they go through
[34:10] their life you know some people are just
[34:12] looking for a kind word somebody's
[34:14] looking for an encouraging word you know
[34:16] you know I always try to speak to
[34:18] everybody and I think with brother dr.
[34:21] Atkins
[34:22] I think he said hello to everybody the
[34:24] first BP 100 people or whatever we'd
[34:27] always try to greet everybody and you
[34:29] know there's a lot of people that that
[34:33] you know that first they wouldn't talk
[34:34] to me and they're there some people work
[34:36] they're still comforting but they don't
[34:37] talk to nobody so I don't feel bad
[34:40] unless it's something nice they actually
[34:43] have to say to somebody they don't see
[34:44] so they don't say it good morning hello
[34:47] you know get out of my leg
[34:48] they don't say nothing unless they need
[34:50] something but but you know I try to talk
[34:54] to everybody and try to speak to
[34:55] everybody and ask everybody doing and
[34:57] you know people only know how I'm doing
[34:59] a lot doing great you don't feel you
[35:02] know always and I've got people that
[35:03] work they laugh at because I have a set
[35:07] of things that I that I say I'm gonna go
[35:09] Mondays we help like this is marvelous
[35:12] Monday and this terrific Tuesday this
[35:14] wonderful Wednesday this thrilling
[35:15] Thursday and fantastic fabulous Fridays
[35:19] and I get off and everybody thinks are
[35:22] you serious like yeah and you know some
[35:27] people something you blood people's
[35:29] money you get up so you know what the
[35:30] Lord got me out of bed this moment I got
[35:32] here you know why there's a lot of
[35:34] people to get out of bed this morning
[35:37] you know and you start to look at it and
[35:40] everybody comes about you know you have
[35:43] problems than ever
[35:44] everybody's got problems you know you go
[35:47] to work you know like they say work is a
[35:48] four-letter word so you know everybody
[35:51] has problems and things that go on and
[35:53] work but you don't think yes it's not
[35:54] it's not how you know what the problem
[35:57] is it's how you handle the problem how
[35:59] you react to it is the thing that makes
[36:02] it better or worse
[36:05] because you there's some people that you
[36:07] know I honestly I got people or I can
[36:09] extend beer I don't will be around I
[36:12] don't listen to me and people ask me why
[36:15] do you have a problem it why because
[36:17] there's something get it I mean I'd
[36:21] rather I'd rather have somebody go ahead
[36:23] and meet with a wire brush I'm just got
[36:26] them down my back then have to listen to
[36:28] me you know you want to stick your
[36:31] fingers in the air and run away from one
[36:35] because they're so making but you know
[36:38] thing is is God has blessed us and given
[36:41] us everything that we haven't either
[36:42] everything that pertains to life and
[36:44] godliness and everything that you have
[36:46] Nina has been given to you in this
[36:48] earthly journey you know we're so
[36:51] blessed that we get up this morning
[36:52] but do we walk and just pass by and
[36:57] Jesus is talking to it's just like the
[37:00] two on the road to Emmaus her and just
[37:04] completely blind to what's going home
[37:08] are we are revolting just like Jesus
[37:12] speaking to them and telling them what
[37:13] was going to take place and then they
[37:15] just go on and write about their
[37:16] business and not realizing that God has
[37:18] called you and blessed you to a place
[37:21] that you know there are certain things
[37:24] in your life that never gonna change
[37:26] but you know what I'm not I'm not
[37:29] worried about that
[37:30] I always tell a little story about the
[37:32] man who had their great big motoring God
[37:33] told him to push the boulder and he set
[37:35] out there and he kept pushing the mower
[37:37] and Boulder
[37:37] you know I just kept pushing on it
[37:39] pushing on it we're gonna laughter years
[37:41] of fishing on that he realized that you
[37:42] know what I'd never moved that mower and
[37:44] he thought you know he was a failure and
[37:46] he kept telling others like look I've
[37:48] been fishing on this site for years and
[37:49] I never move and done why don't why am I
[37:55] going through this didn't is just I have
[37:57] I'm just a failure there's nothing
[37:58] accomplished in all this and the Lord
[38:01] told him said listen said I never told
[38:04] you to move it I told you to push
[38:09] they said no look at yourself they said
[38:11] look at the muscles that you feel look
[38:13] at the changes taking place in you not
[38:16] moving the bone he said I've never told
[38:19] you the movement he said I told you to
[38:20] push and he said the more you push the
[38:23] more the change took place in me and
[38:27] many times things happen in our lives
[38:28] where we can't change we're not going to
[38:30] be able to change but you know look the
[38:31] change takes place in us as the song
[38:35] says sometimes he calms the storm
[38:37] sometimes he calls me you know that's
[38:42] the way is are we mindful to seek things
[38:44] the way God has made that God has
[38:47] blessed us and coming up I just want to
[38:50] be mindful that if they got every day
[38:51] and to see the supernatural working of
[38:55] God in our lives you know as given here
[39:01] for this later brother Devils filled up
[39:02] you know we were talking about the nine
[39:04] spiritual gifts and you know many times
[39:07] people act like you know the gifts
[39:09] aren't working we don't seek the gifts
[39:10] well you know what if we actually open
[39:13] our eyes and actually read what the
[39:14] scripture says then you know what we
[39:17] realize God is working we do see the
[39:19] nine spiritual gifts working it's just
[39:22] not tongues of interpretation but you
[39:26] know it's gifts of healing it's the
[39:27] wisdom knowledge
[39:31] the working of miracles the different
[39:34] things that take the place that's right
[39:38] those two were the least but you know we
[39:41] see those things working you know
[39:43] sometimes if we open our eyes Lord let
[39:44] me open my eyes then let me see what's
[39:47] going on what you're doing around us
[39:51] because you sometimes it's I don't know
[39:54] about you but sometimes we'll really
[39:55] Dale preaches and you know he says long
[39:57] with you to catch this well you know
[39:59] what I don't catch you I know I mean
[40:03] sometimes it's like you know you know
[40:06] he'll he'll be preaching on something
[40:07] and they want you to catch something and
[40:09] I'm like well or not my kitchen then it
[40:12] takes a while but you know I think the
[40:14] Lord allows that to happen sometimes we
[40:16] both are you going to how do you want to
[40:18] react to because sometimes it's you're
[40:20] digging a little bit more you're having
[40:22] to pursue this a little more for God to
[40:25] come speak to so do you do we have that
[40:32] to look and then follow that and do what
[40:36] God has us to do what God has laid
[40:39] before us you know you know was like
[40:44] when God tell brother branham to create
[40:48] the squirrel and you know he said to
[40:52] speak to the squirrels he spoke this
[40:54] world into existence and they were there
[40:58] were three that he spoke into existence
[41:00] and you know ground was able to shoot
[41:01] them and he found them but the four of
[41:04] them there was one time that he couldn't
[41:05] find one of you know he spoke it and
[41:08] then and then the brother was praying
[41:10] like Lord if if brother branham's
[41:12] correct let him finding that four foot
[41:16] well you know brother Adam saw that
[41:18] fourth one and he saw him come into
[41:22] existence and he shot it but you know he
[41:24] had to go out there and start hopping
[41:26] around the truck
[41:27] five that for it was out there but you
[41:30] know what it took you a little while for
[41:31] him to get out there and he had to dig
[41:32] and you know he fell though it was under
[41:35] a piece of bark and everything and you
[41:36] know he had to get out there and dig for
[41:37] he was out there but he had a gig for
[41:40] and sometimes that's the way it is with
[41:42] us you know it's out there but sometimes
[41:44] we got a deep pool to look for here
[41:47] because God wants us to have something
[41:49] to do that we can see it because then we
[41:54] get into this little rough sometimes
[41:55] things come yes they get our attention
[42:00] well god bless you this morning
[42:09] [Music]
