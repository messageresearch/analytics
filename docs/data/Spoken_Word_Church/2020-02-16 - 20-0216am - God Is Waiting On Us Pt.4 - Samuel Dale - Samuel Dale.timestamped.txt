[18:41] completing you in Jesus name Amen
[18:50] go to Hebrews and we could just save
[18:55] reading a lot and all but you know let's
[18:58] go we're about verse 37 it says talking
[19:02] about how they were stones on the
[19:03] sundered tempted were slain with the
[19:08] sword all the Old Testament Saints
[19:09] everybody understand this this is the
[19:13] Old Testament Saints it's speaking of
[19:16] them and the things that happen to them
[19:18] in their lives and time all right of
[19:25] whom the world was not worthy they
[19:28] wandered in deserts and mountains and in
[19:29] dens and caves of the earth these all
[19:33] having obtained a good report through
[19:36] faith received not the promise something
[19:41] was withholding our didn't come at that
[19:43] time all right God having provided some
[19:46] better thing for us that they without us
[19:48] should not be made perfect you may be
[19:51] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[19:54] reading of the word we
[20:08] I had a good time yesterday and enjoyed
[20:12] it and everything they were even the
[20:14] ladies they told me how much they
[20:16] appreciated doing the things you know
[20:18] and all for us to just have a good time
[20:21] cause they could at least end back life
[20:23] a little bit with us and in the
[20:25] situations and all and we just enjoyed
[20:28] it you know right now I've been quite a
[20:30] bit on this this makes number four work
[20:34] yes message on that god is waiting on us
[20:42] and we think all the time that we're
[20:45] waiting on God well that's true and
[20:47] that's the human items we are people and
[20:50] we're supposed to be dependent upon him
[20:54] and wait on him to guide us into life
[20:58] but it it's like the the Prophet came
[21:00] over there you know and he he he told
[21:03] him said to Moses don't cry at all to
[21:07] speak it well it's always been that God
[21:10] wants us to take upon our own lips take
[21:16] up on our own being of what we are and
[21:19] in things and speak the word and move
[21:22] forward oh that's that's them Kamiya
[21:25] it's been my goal is to see a church you
[21:28] know that would believe God's Word and
[21:31] be able to anchor into that word enough
[21:33] to you know bypass all of this old life
[21:38] and times internet forth into what God
[21:42] has really designed and whatever all
[21:45] right but I'm trying to get a little
[21:46] point in and I want to get that in
[21:50] another thing I made a couple of
[21:52] statements the other day I've got to
[21:54] clarify late but I'll do it later I
[21:55] won't do it but the statements was
[21:59] writings and it was just West you
[22:02] misunderstood but anyhow well we'll get
[22:04] that straight cuz we just want to do
[22:07] today is to try to bring this point to
[22:10] an end why and for what for him if
[22:18] opinion what for what ungodly Rives them
[22:21] do you think that it would be the gods
[22:24] waiting on me and you you know I mean
[22:29] that may not seem strange to you I mean
[22:34] I mean we can to comprehend you don't
[22:35] understand waiting on God that's that's
[22:39] the point you know for him to come on
[22:42] the scene and do this and do that and
[22:43] that's true now let's see really God is
[22:48] waiting on me and you to be able to step
[22:53] out move on in him and to get away from
[22:59] ourselves and just walk in the light of
[23:01] the love of God
[23:02] all right now I've tried to get you to
[23:05] think about it because you know the Lord
[23:08] spoke to me about the point and to
[23:11] showing me what what is me meant by they
[23:16] without us there in Hebrews cannot be
[23:21] made perfect now we can go through the
[23:22] lineup of everything just to try to
[23:24] cover everybody that word perfect there
[23:27] does not mean that there's some kind of
[23:30] perfection or or you know you need to
[23:32] wash a little bit more a buff a little
[23:34] bit more do this out of the other now
[23:36] it's simply explaining a situation that
[23:41] I believe see by that that it's meaning
[23:47] to you and I it's in the end time what
[23:50] would be you know we go to a movie we
[23:55] watch it and it finishes you know and
[23:58] then it says the end it's always got a
[24:01] big scene that the whole story for an
[24:05] hour and a half of the movie is building
[24:09] a thing in your mind for you to think on
[24:13] but then all it wants it to end it this
[24:15] comes up and John and happy John and
[24:18] Mary lived happily ever after it comes
[24:21] to a point but remember that point is
[24:25] the reason for the whole story
[24:30] you know we thought what they well they
[24:32] just go right now through the you know
[24:34] the sunset sometimes well that whole
[24:36] movie is built for that see if you said
[24:39] well we'll sum up the sum up the movie
[24:42] you know to us in this then you just say
[24:46] John and happened John and Ray lived
[24:48] happily ever after
[24:49] see that would be the point but we
[24:52] wouldn't just do it that way but that
[24:54] would be the point right if you said
[24:56] well well you know give me the story and
[24:59] you give them page one and then say John
[25:02] will you to know who Johnny is and
[25:04] what's happening and that the whole
[25:07] story is to get you to get those two
[25:09] people together but to finish with the
[25:12] final scene of the movie
[25:15] alright natural way of expressing it see
[25:18] because I believe that that's the same
[25:21] thing as the spiritual is happening that
[25:25] God has waited to the last to finish it
[25:29] up alright we're down at the end of the
[25:33] book at the end of the story we'll come
[25:37] on folks we ought to be after all of
[25:40] these years waiting in this happening
[25:42] and that happening but then we find out
[25:45] God was waiting on us well alright let's
[25:48] wake up to the point of what we have to
[25:52] do with the story see the story is about
[25:57] John and Mary right I mean you make a
[26:01] move you know it's about them it's not
[26:04] about the author it's not about all the
[26:07] other thing it's about them we'll see
[26:10] then here's the whole Bible the entire
[26:14] Bible is to be summed up in the end time
[26:17] by a people becoming what God wanted him
[26:21] to be and he can come on the scene and
[26:25] make manifest his word you said well I
[26:30] don't think it'll ever happen alright so
[26:32] if you don't we go down and go but a
[26:33] great I mean we've got a choice this is
[26:36] the end time is not a time element
[26:39] running out of clock goes tick tick tick
[26:41] you know
[26:42] now this is not that this is the
[26:45] finishing up of all time and I'm as
[26:48] seriously as I can be I'm putting it
[26:49] here in three messages fourth one now to
[26:52] say God is waiting on you and I to wake
[26:58] up from our petty little talks and well
[27:01] we don't believe this but we don't see
[27:03] this what are you talking about you
[27:05] don't see I mean is your heart still
[27:07] beating that's a miracle
[27:11] right I mean what are we looking for
[27:14] miracles what I just don't see God doing
[27:17] things all right maybe we ought to wake
[27:19] up to that you know and see it around
[27:23] the world today there's great
[27:24] manifestations of God around the world
[27:27] every day and see then that's that's
[27:32] what we need but that's what the Lord
[27:34] showed me now here's the whole point in
[27:37] a nutshell whatever God started with
[27:41] that's the way he's going to finish
[27:46] right so if he started with John and
[27:50] Mary he's not gonna change situations
[27:53] and the story and come out and how two
[27:56] or three more people involved know he's
[27:59] going to end the story with John and
[28:02] Mary alright now that's the way I
[28:05] believe the Bible I believe the entire
[28:07] Bible is to be finalized finished
[28:10] brought into being now we're talking
[28:13] about two Gentile dispensation we know
[28:14] don't just say well hey don't we know
[28:17] that we're not going beyond to the the
[28:20] fields you we're not going on out to the
[28:22] Jews and the redemption of Israel we're
[28:25] talking about our Redemption are you
[28:27] with me see our Redemption because it's
[28:33] all dependent in there odd that he puts
[28:35] us right in the place to where the end
[28:41] of all of it would be he chose us for a
[28:44] Pacific purpose okay you said well
[28:49] what's my purpose and brother Dale I'm
[28:51] here to be the word and believe the word
[28:54] to just believe it and accept it how you
[28:58] gonna get your healing leave the word
[29:00] confess it with your mouth and let it be
[29:04] made manifest how are you gonna get your
[29:06] salvation believe in the word confessing
[29:09] the word walk into it all right how is
[29:11] there gonna be a change of the body
[29:15] somebody's going to catch it and they're
[29:19] going to walk into it all right
[29:21] now we then will have our right of
[29:23] choice to be able to volunteer for it or
[29:26] we can be this time can just keep
[29:28] running on for us but somebody somewhere
[29:30] is going to catch it and move into it I
[29:35] contend this up so let's believe it why
[29:39] would you read the Bible for somebody
[29:40] else come on now if you want to just
[29:45] stay a while on that that's what we've
[29:46] done the Baptist that's what I used to
[29:48] kind of believe it was for everybody
[29:50] else wooden for me but then I began to
[29:53] hate wait a minute this this Bible is
[29:55] talking to me then when I heard the
[29:58] endtime message see then I really saw
[30:01] what it was talking about impulses day
[30:05] without us could not be made perfect
[30:09] okay so that word perfect means to be
[30:13] complete or to finish up it has nothing
[30:16] to do with the bodily perfections you
[30:21] know anything in the rims of those
[30:23] things it has to do with the fact of us
[30:26] believing God's Word and walking right
[30:29] into it all right now so what was our
[30:32] thought centered on whatever God starts
[30:37] with God's original creation if you'll
[30:40] notice in the Bible
[30:41] see Adam was a grown man there wasn't a
[30:46] baby and grown up then their disciples
[30:52] the disciples was not babies
[30:55] grown men in the gospel so every bit of
[31:00] God's creation
[31:02] anywhere he starts a beginning of a
[31:04] creation in the way he wants it it
[31:07] always start with a full-grown all right
[31:10] there Adam in the garden was full-grown
[31:15] he was a human being created of God made
[31:19] in the image of God and made for a
[31:23] specific purpose to be God's plan and
[31:28] purpose best thing to say and God put
[31:33] into Adam what he wants ever son to be
[31:38] that's why it's so important to follow
[31:40] the prophets message because there was
[31:43] no way we could find it anywhere else
[31:45] see nobody else knows anything about
[31:48] Adam being and having eternal life in
[31:51] his soul the biggest portion of this
[31:54] message don't know it they don't think
[31:57] on it they don't study on it and you say
[32:02] well Adam had eternal life in his soul I
[32:05] don't know worry didn't know I don't
[32:08] know you know I don't everybody all of
[32:13] these brothers drink their water - cause
[32:16] it would dry well forgive me my mouth is
[32:24] just it's been four weeks now just dried
[32:26] out and alright but now listen so what
[32:31] did he start with he didn't start with a
[32:35] baby in the garden now he could have
[32:39] done that right he could have put Adam
[32:43] and Eve with all cuz of all the other
[32:45] animals see they were created full-grown
[32:49] I believe but then they started
[32:51] multiplying well I believe that you and
[32:54] I I mean mankind what started off would
[32:58] have been Adam with eternal life brother
[33:01] Branham says in blasphemous names
[33:06] especially into Adam the breath of
[33:10] eternal life to make him an eternal
[33:14] person with God I now do we believe that
[33:19] now it didn't take the new birth to
[33:21] bring that man into being
[33:22] he wouldn't birth as a baby Hindu all
[33:25] enough
[33:26] he was spoken into existence to be the
[33:29] beginning of a natural human creation
[33:32] and put in that what he wants ever son
[33:36] in that creation and daughter to be all
[33:40] right
[33:40] so then he put eternal out now if you
[33:42] won't teach them you just read it right
[33:45] around cents book god off the blasting
[33:48] minutes night especially upon Adam now
[33:51] either running any computers you're
[33:53] gonna run in special don't run in you
[33:57] know don't try to just run it in special
[33:59] way brother runs but God's put see feet
[34:04] clean let me put that in in the correct
[34:05] order a phone Adam breathed the breath
[34:08] of eternal life and he became an eternal
[34:12] person with God he had powerful like God
[34:15] he was an amateur God all right what was
[34:18] God doing making his first son and
[34:23] putting him in charge of the world right
[34:26] the earth and things his son all right
[34:30] and that's what he won't sit to be in me
[34:32] and you all right now when he started at
[34:37] him and put him there he put in there
[34:39] perfect you agree because God cannot
[34:44] create anything imperfect so when he
[34:47] created Adam he was perfect in body
[34:49] spirit and soul as a man this has to be
[34:54] what God wanted and he was there rent in
[34:58] the garden to do those things
[35:00] he put the 126 man if you wanted by do a
[35:03] background part he put to 126 man into
[35:07] the to seven I think is what it is where
[35:10] he created natural Adam and he puts it
[35:13] there in the you know to come forth all
[35:17] right that's why he would be called then
[35:20] the first Adam well now he's called the
[35:23] first Adam concrete now he was called
[35:25] the first Adam because he was created
[35:27] way God wanted him you know if you
[35:29] listen to that thought you'll see more
[35:31] about it
[35:32] it'd be more interesting to you to think
[35:34] about Adam his being what God wanted was
[35:38] right there all right now why did God
[35:44] not make the body and spirit of Adam
[35:50] eternal they made his soul eternal which
[35:58] was an impartation of his own life right
[36:00] why did he not make the body and spirit
[36:03] eternal because there was no way that
[36:07] they could have ever fallen if he ed
[36:12] eternal life in body spirit and soul
[36:14] there would have been no fall all right
[36:17] but yet leaving him like he was made him
[36:21] perfect to the point but yet God knowing
[36:24] what Adam would do so he just gives me
[36:29] everything ready
[36:30] you know everything is right in order
[36:32] and here comes the beast here comes the
[36:35] thing here comes ease now come on you
[36:38] get what brother branham on back to the
[36:42] eve and you'll find she had eternal life
[36:46] into her soul she did now what's you out
[36:49] you won't try to make her one thing in
[36:51] him another no she was the same thing as
[36:54] him Adam and Eve were the same all right
[36:57] now then in doing that then you see that
[37:03] they were made not to on they were not
[37:08] made to fall you know what I mean they
[37:11] wouldn't made default but they were made
[37:14] in the position they were in to where
[37:17] they could fall are you following me see
[37:21] Adam even though he had eternal life in
[37:23] his so he could still be tempted and
[37:26] tried well I don't know where that well
[37:29] then what about you don't you have
[37:32] eternal life in your soul by the new
[37:33] birth well you don't have no problems
[37:38] you don't you don't have no troubles
[37:40] well I'll be glad what we anytime you
[37:43] don't do that
[37:44] you know I have a battle and all this
[37:46] stuff but now listen to see he couldn't
[37:50] he didn't make Adam eternal life yNN's
[37:54] body spirit and soul he made him eternal
[37:58] in his soul
[37:59] all right knowing then that the fall
[38:01] would come that he would do what she
[38:05] would do Adam would do what he would do
[38:06] and it would bring the human race into
[38:09] that position but he knew that would
[38:11] bring forward all of his attributes
[38:13] right now are you with me that would
[38:15] bring his attributes so he didn't make
[38:18] them wrong he made them perfect he
[38:24] didn't make a sinner no he made a person
[38:28] a human being because that would be his
[38:32] design down here now as I said keep
[38:35] watching Adam if you'll take Adam from
[38:37] that you'll see I could name the animals
[38:39] how all the things could take place and
[38:41] all I kept because he was God of the
[38:43] earth all right now so water which is
[38:46] supposed to be all right now but see
[38:51] that put then a thing in line that God
[38:56] could display his attributes okay we see
[38:58] the fall and we see the the things
[39:00] happening down through we see in the Old
[39:02] Testament they were mighty marvelous
[39:06] situations took place great experiences
[39:11] those people had but yet we see that in
[39:14] that Old Testament they did not come
[39:17] forth with eternal life in their soul
[39:18] they just become a living soul good
[39:22] after the fall how could you bring
[39:23] anything all right now then see all of
[39:28] that would be waiting all that Old
[39:32] Testament was waiting there was nobody
[39:35] in the Old Testament had eternal life
[39:37] but Adam Jesus comes as the keystone
[39:42] between the old and the new putting it
[39:45] all together into one thing and as he
[39:48] does then Jesus Christ who Almighty God
[39:51] in human flesh here comes the second
[39:55] Adam the first Adam was
[39:58] was a natural human being but not just
[40:00] in a natural totally he was he had
[40:03] eternal life in his soul all right but
[40:09] yet he needed to get to that tree now
[40:11] you understand what I'm saying that God
[40:13] made everything so perfect everything's
[40:16] right in order the Tree of Life was
[40:17] right there they could have went to the
[40:21] Tree of Life right and it would have
[40:26] made their bodies eternal he said well
[40:30] how do you know that this Bible is the
[40:34] Word of God this Bible is the tree of
[40:37] life what is happening all we got to do
[40:44] is just read that Bible and we're
[40:46] protectors of eternal life in the
[40:49] natural no no I'm not saying you read it
[40:51] into something great eternal I'm just
[40:53] using the illustration okay now so that
[40:57] for I was kind of picking up the little
[40:59] different ones and you know new ones
[41:01] today not leaving them behind on us that
[41:05] Jesus Christ then was God's full example
[41:08] child but yet it was just a second Adam
[41:13] right I mean that's what he was what was
[41:16] Jesus then Jesus was a human being God
[41:25] was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[41:26] himself remember the Bible calls him the
[41:30] man Christ Jesus so that Jesus comes
[41:36] forth and he's a natural he's first he's
[41:39] a beginning of the creation of the
[41:41] spiritual Adam you know all right which
[41:44] would be the new birth to us but now to
[41:47] him he came forth into eternal life
[41:50] that was little Jehovah crying in the
[41:53] cradle that was Almighty God laying
[41:55] there playing in the cradle
[41:58] because he was a human being now here's
[42:01] worth then I'll explain it back when I
[42:03] dropped back for it but I still want you
[42:05] to follow the point or thought because
[42:08] this is the way I've always touted
[42:11] there Jesus was body a man name is Adam
[42:20] spirit and soul the same as Adam made
[42:28] him a man alright now we'll get into the
[42:31] division don't worry about it I studied
[42:34] a little bit I know that that spirit in
[42:37] Jesus was a spirit in in divers manners
[42:39] Roldan I know all I know the scripture
[42:43] yet we will get back to that later in a
[42:45] natural point my point is I'm wanting
[42:48] you to see whatever that man Adam
[42:52] international needed are doing it what
[42:55] happened
[42:55] you start the Bible if you look it's a
[42:58] beautiful picture to me you start the
[43:00] Bible with a full-grown child of God a
[43:05] son of God Adam was a son of God not
[43:10] just a physical creation he was the son
[43:13] of God that eternal life was dwelling
[43:15] within his soul uh-huh then when Jesus
[43:19] comes he he was Almighty God eternal
[43:22] life dwelling in a human being to be the
[43:28] second Adam alright now this man spent a
[43:32] long time but he was a man he didn't say
[43:37] I know what most people think
[43:38] and I've tried myself to explain it with
[43:42] you no I will get back to it
[43:45] Adam first man Adam second man Adam
[43:52] first man Adam was made a living soul
[43:55] is that what Corinthians says the second
[43:58] Adam was made a living spirit are
[44:02] eternal are the best way for me to put
[44:04] it in human language you realize that
[44:06] second man Adam was the god of glory he
[44:11] wasn't this the son of God that had a
[44:14] father up in heaven and he was on earth
[44:16] as a son and and we got all that now he
[44:19] was Almighty God see you say well
[44:22] who who was and he was God when he was a
[44:25] baby who was running the world oh that's
[44:29] really smart
[44:30] I mean we think were always smart who
[44:33] was running the world all I had to do
[44:35] say it because you see all of God was
[44:40] not in that human flesh he had to come
[44:47] down through time he had to come down
[44:48] through the anointings we'll get to that
[44:50] he had to come to those great things
[44:52] were they said anointing could come on
[44:54] in and then leave him in the garden
[44:56] we've been through these things so don't
[44:58] worry just listen all right
[45:00] see that but here comes what Adam had
[45:04] need of the trendsetting Adam has
[45:07] restored all things I mean in Jesus has
[45:10] restored all things that Adam fell by
[45:13] and all this restored in Jesus Christ
[45:15] all right now but get my point here's
[45:18] the beginning the man Adam a body a
[45:27] spirit and the soul a human being that's
[45:32] what God wanted was eternal life in Adam
[45:36] and then these other things would
[45:39] transpire in the fall would come he
[45:42] didn't make it come I'll emphasize that
[45:44] he didn't make them fall but he just
[45:47] knew they would let's see what was Adam
[45:51] waiting on what was know awaiting them I
[45:54] said there's great things back there
[45:56] great men great prophet since I you know
[45:59] walk off the earth but you know when
[46:01] he's walking off the earth didn't give
[46:02] him eternal life he just walked off the
[46:07] earth Elijah took a chariot ride they
[46:11] didn't give him eternal life they just
[46:14] took a chariot ride oh you said where's
[46:17] yet well I know where Elijah standing
[46:20] waiting till even get back over there
[46:21] don't want them to witnesses I know
[46:24] about that but Enoch I don't know about
[46:26] but I'm just making up illustration
[46:30] great wonderful things took place in the
[46:33] Old Testament
[46:35] under the blood of bulls and goats right
[46:42] you didn't have eternal life through
[46:45] that you can see the Spirit of God as it
[46:47] moves among man and does and and all of
[46:49] the great things that are happening but
[46:52] yet you don't hear him speak of his soul
[46:55] not the vex best you're gonna do when
[46:59] your study needs to get over David and
[47:03] the Psalms and the things you know then
[47:06] you'll find him crying out but that's
[47:09] the display give one come when he come
[47:12] run over then here's Jesus Christ he's
[47:15] the keystone between the old and new
[47:17] Testament that Old Testament was waiting
[47:19] on him all right see then it would start
[47:23] a New Testament he started his church on
[47:26] the day of Pentecost 120 in the upper
[47:29] room all right 120 in the upper room
[47:33] they received eternal life gave their
[47:37] soul eternal life with their body and
[47:39] spirit was not eternal but you see God
[47:41] standing now in the position that he
[47:45] wanted to bring it back remember what
[47:47] was it he wanted to bring this man Adam
[47:50] into being back there but he fell away
[47:53] from it but now you see the bride coming
[47:55] forth and as she's coming forth he turn
[48:01] a life begins to be a picture again and
[48:03] the listen it begins to draw so those
[48:07] are Old Testament people when that when
[48:10] that human being called Jesus Christ
[48:13] stood on this earth you think that I
[48:18] didn't make the word of the word that
[48:20] could field a pool and that's the point
[48:22] of what I'm talking about
[48:23] if you can just see the point of what
[48:26] I'm saying Adam was back back there was
[48:30] nothing else down through there that
[48:32] could take him and bring him to the
[48:33] right place but Jesus Christ good and he
[48:36] became the second Adam the god of glory
[48:41] all right he starts his church on the
[48:44] day of Pentecost 120 in the Upper Room
[48:47] few hours later
[48:49] three or four thousand outside but what
[48:52] did it happen
[48:53] they wrote around said the disciples had
[48:56] these virtues now I'm stopping right
[48:59] there because what he said he said but
[49:01] the headstone hadn't come yet
[49:03] that's his words all right there was the
[49:07] disciples standing there with what we
[49:12] call the faith of the father's eternal
[49:15] life in a human being and the capability
[49:18] of growing in grace and knowledge and
[49:21] bringing forth because that would be the
[49:25] the full-grown second atom all right so
[49:30] then Paul one of those men he one of
[49:35] those that made a proclamation somebody
[49:41] maybe said something to him one day said
[49:43] you know Paul what's gonna happen those
[49:46] Old Testament science and he says well
[49:51] we don't need to worry about to him
[49:53] you know maybe they pushed him a little
[49:54] so he did he just took the whole
[49:56] eleventh chapter and he describes all of
[49:59] them how wonderful and at the end of it
[50:03] he stops and the person again says yeah
[50:06] well what do we do now and Paul said
[50:09] let's remember one time we have within
[50:12] us what that same first Adam had we have
[50:16] eternal life in our soul we are the
[50:19] beginning of the creation of God as the
[50:21] bride across all right and he says now
[50:24] what do we do he said we're gonna have
[50:27] to wait and they're gonna have to wait
[50:30] cause it's not finished it wasn't
[50:35] finished for Jesus Christ to walk on
[50:37] earth that didn't finish it all he has
[50:43] to come forth and become all of the
[50:45] things and make the price and pay it of
[50:48] a Redemption to her that we could
[50:51] receive the life that he had within us
[50:54] but on the day of Pentecost you see what
[50:56] was pulling up Adam come on brother and
[51:01] said one of these days
[51:03] come on he says now quoting him he said
[51:07] Adam would wake up
[51:11] he said he'd reach over and get either
[51:13] says she wake up
[51:15] he said he reach over and get set and
[51:17] able to and he says they would stand up
[51:21] on earth what's he talking about a pool
[51:24] see once that first Adam come into the
[51:28] being you know Adam then when the second
[51:31] Adam comes in there's a direct pool
[51:33] right down through to where that second
[51:35] Adam can take all things all right
[51:39] you'll see that comes right into you and
[51:42] a new birth then there's the apostles in
[51:44] time yeah they had the new birth but it
[51:48] wouldn't have enough so Paul says they
[51:51] without us should not be made perfect
[51:55] well what are we going to do is it going
[51:58] to be that we pull them up and I'm just
[52:00] illustrating that to be carnal or a year
[52:03] carnal raise are we gonna raise up those
[52:06] people off and dust the dirt off of them
[52:08] you know and clean them up and now y'all
[52:11] are worthy I don't think so alright but
[52:16] what I think I've never had too much in
[52:19] my mind to where we're gonna have to
[52:20] walk out the graveyard didn't tell about
[52:22] bodies to come out I don't think so
[52:25] that's why we got the pictures down
[52:28] Stars of the people from here a lot of
[52:31] them that has pie stone and they're
[52:33] young you know why I wanna know what
[52:37] they look like I don't think we're gonna
[52:41] be up preaching or having services in
[52:43] here comes from one who told us David I
[52:47] don't think so now I believe when they
[52:52] walk among us they're gonna be young and
[52:55] I want to know them that I can see all
[52:57] right but now listen then one that God
[53:02] gave His life that could come back and
[53:05] live in me and you trying to make it
[53:06] short matter what Paul was the greatest
[53:09] teacher of the New Testament age you
[53:12] know he wrote most of the Bible all of
[53:15] the things with the great
[53:17] so Paul he understood the communion he
[53:19] understood all the things he understood
[53:21] the change of the body he spoke of it he
[53:24] understood it to be something would
[53:26] happen in the end time and he called it
[53:27] he says you know there have to be a
[53:29] force and an archangel enough to be all
[53:32] kind he understood a lot and he he said
[53:34] I've been to be hung in the glory said I
[53:37] can't even tell you the things I can't
[53:43] even tell you the things that I saw her
[53:47] alright reckon he saw where we're at you
[53:51] know maybe he did huh
[53:53] but the point now I see Paul then he
[53:56] realizes that there's something wrong
[53:59] the coast now there's an argument among
[54:04] mankind whether a mule pulls a wagon or
[54:07] pushes it you've heard that one you know
[54:11] mule and wagon and they argue whether
[54:14] the Mew pulls the wagon
[54:16] or pushes it you're gonna life that
[54:20] because he pushes it who don't know he
[54:26] pulls it will let turn around backwards
[54:28] and they do this way then well no we put
[54:31] Arizona okay thank you
[54:33] you get to hear his own football purpose
[54:37] what do you put the gears on for then
[54:40] you hook up these little trays James
[54:42] back here and ever what you got back
[54:44] there you're pulling it but you're not
[54:47] pulling it you're actually pushing it
[54:49] not just carnal what I thought maybe
[54:53] you'd never heard something like that I
[54:54] listened to stories sometimes cuz they
[54:56] give you a point all right see God is
[55:00] pulling you and I to a place when this
[55:05] message came forward now you can think
[55:07] whatever I've told you over and over
[55:09] when I saw God not say young man let me
[55:12] your old kid I always wanted to see that
[55:15] guard from you know until this day I
[55:17] still desire to see him you know what's
[55:20] left that's made of pool that's made of
[55:24] connection a pool that I have with that
[55:28] and I'm desiring to be that with that
[55:31] see then Paul realizes hey we got to get
[55:36] this on so he says day without us and
[55:41] they said well Paul what we're gonna do
[55:43] he said well until this finishes up
[55:47] we're gonna die and go by the grave we
[55:50] said one day we'll be changed the moment
[55:52] a twinkling of an eye he gives us a hope
[55:54] see he puts something out in front of us
[55:57] now come on listen to what I'm saying
[56:00] I'm trying to explain that they without
[56:03] us could not be made perfect where the
[56:05] connection is as you difficult came
[56:07] change of God has done that down through
[56:11] time from his beginning to coming
[56:13] through to where Adam and David and
[56:17] Solomon and all of them just a chain
[56:20] that's pulling everybody he come right
[56:24] over in the New Testament step forth in
[56:26] human flesh
[56:27] Almighty God dwelling on earth and it
[56:32] started a pool it started a gathering
[56:36] don't you feel the pool we sing that
[56:39] song like knowing I feel the pool I hear
[56:44] the call what can't you feel the pool
[56:50] you realize what I'm saying that that I
[56:53] was looking for something I told my wife
[56:56] when I first reading the Bible I said
[56:59] one of these days there's going to be
[57:00] two prophets come well I couldn't
[57:04] understand Malachi 4 3 & 4 but I knew
[57:08] Luke 1:17 and how it covered and could
[57:10] take you through that to where you would
[57:12] go to Isaiah 42 and you'd find John the
[57:16] Baptist's and the things the Elijah I
[57:18] couldn't understand the coming of a
[57:21] 4-time of Elijah see to be in our day
[57:26] all right let's see a pool started you
[57:30] understand what I'm getting at you
[57:33] realize when you receive the new birth
[57:35] at faith all right
[57:39] you realize the headstones pulling you
[57:44] the headstone is pulling you pulling
[57:51] this to that place to where one day
[57:54] we're gonna walk off this earth alright
[57:57] and see the pool is there that's what
[57:59] I'm getting to why or what why the does
[58:03] it say they without us gonna be perfect
[58:05] because we have to get a line up
[58:08] connection to tie Redemption all the way
[58:10] back to the garden and stand over here
[58:13] and let that come out in the end time
[58:16] and it did in the message of the hour
[58:19] I'm not looking for a message to come
[58:22] forth to try to explain Redemption no
[58:26] we've had the message of redemption
[58:28] that's what we've been waiting on that's
[58:31] what PO did not have come on Paul had
[58:35] the greatest message the greatest
[58:36] writings in time but he did not know
[58:39] what those seals are come on brother
[58:44] branham saw it dreams visions and
[58:45] whatever and it whipped top off and down
[58:48] in there he saw the seals but what they
[58:50] say unwritten word in other words nobody
[58:54] could understand it it took a prophet he
[58:57] realized then that once mankind started
[59:00] he was waiting for Malachi 4 to come
[59:03] into being
[59:04] darzee pool it's wonderful of having
[59:08] eternal life it's wonderful even to be
[59:10] like for the Apostle Paul and how the
[59:12] great gifts and the signs and wonders
[59:14] and all that brother Branham but still
[59:16] there's got to be a pool that's what I'm
[59:19] talking about a pool that that's the
[59:21] purpose of day without us it connects us
[59:26] each one gets connected with that he
[59:30] turn alive by the new birth in your soul
[59:33] makes the connection with you and
[59:34] eternity and all you got to do is just
[59:36] eat your way into it
[59:38] that's what this message was far this
[59:41] message now listen was not to just to
[59:44] restore the faith of the fathers that's
[59:47] wonderful that has to happen but it's to
[59:51] take us to a change of the body
[59:53] and Adam could not do nothing but speak
[59:56] of it he couldn't bring it forth even
[1:00:00] though the people walked off the earth
[1:00:02] chariot something like that still that
[1:00:07] did not bring forth the plan of
[1:00:10] redemption you see one day then a little
[1:00:13] man struck the earth Almighty God
[1:00:15] himself in human flesh the Lord Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ he was the keystone between the
[1:00:21] old and the new there's anything what
[1:00:23] we're doing that's why stir conquer you
[1:00:25] didn't get it I guess while ago world
[1:00:27] does the new pool of push the we look
[1:00:32] back we better start looking forward
[1:00:37] there I know the story with that true
[1:00:40] don't look back and don't look forward
[1:00:41] so ok that's what I'm meaning let's look
[1:00:44] at the present tense let's look at it
[1:00:46] right now let's see eternal life right
[1:00:49] now in our understanding of God's Word
[1:00:55] did you follow the thought the
[1:00:57] understanding of God's Word the opening
[1:00:59] of God's work this message came to bring
[1:01:01] us eternal life in a body the thing that
[1:01:04] we didn't have the things all of those
[1:01:07] Old Testament Saints didn't have the
[1:01:09] things that New Testament Saints Paul
[1:01:13] spoke of the change of the body but he
[1:01:17] never attained into it he went by the
[1:01:19] grave so is everybody going by the grave
[1:01:22] until somebody sees it and since this is
[1:01:25] the day this is the day of the change of
[1:01:29] the body alright but you see the point
[1:01:35] is the world then would be waiting
[1:01:38] coming down through in the Old Testament
[1:01:41] until Jesus Christ stepped upon the
[1:01:44] earth all right then he just kept coming
[1:01:50] on the truth made a New Testament made a
[1:01:53] pool you just consider what I'm saying
[1:01:57] that there was a pool started in you and
[1:02:03] I in the new birth
[1:02:06] let's see this was not to just stop it
[1:02:09] was not to just restore a third atom if
[1:02:13] you want to call him or whatever or a
[1:02:14] position of atom coming back into doing
[1:02:18] now huh
[1:02:19] we need you turn a life in these bodies
[1:02:22] and spirits that we have that's where we
[1:02:25] need any turn a life well I thought I
[1:02:28] had eternal life over there that's in
[1:02:30] your soul only it is not in your body in
[1:02:36] your spirit I hope not if you do come
[1:02:38] here and I'll paint you will find out
[1:02:40] what you got it give me a hammer I hit
[1:02:41] you on the toe he says that's it now
[1:02:45] that's been explaining your silliness we
[1:02:48] know that there's something wrong and
[1:02:50] the Bible said Romans 8 that the whole
[1:02:54] world even everything creation of all
[1:03:00] things is what groaning waiting for the
[1:03:03] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[1:03:05] of God right waiting on somebody to step
[1:03:11] onto earth that was doing and that's
[1:03:14] what I like about it you talk about even
[1:03:16] the nature of groaning things what do
[1:03:20] you think happened when that bull come
[1:03:23] running at that prophet he just says no
[1:03:34] you stop there stop go on the light down
[1:03:38] there and he just looks around brildor
[1:03:41] oh here he is
[1:03:44] one day he booked a hornet's nest and it
[1:03:47] just went all over him we're all hanging
[1:03:50] around him and he stopped and he said
[1:03:53] that little Hornets go back to you
[1:03:54] your nest I'm sorry what are you talking
[1:03:59] about you realize that nature saw its
[1:04:02] master I've always taught you that
[1:04:06] nature so it's master when a man could
[1:04:11] stand and look at a bull as charging and
[1:04:14] weighing thousands of pounds and him
[1:04:16] charging straight at you just look
[1:04:19] the board you just called lay down right
[1:04:25] you see I've seen people do things in
[1:04:28] the natural that you can show the
[1:04:30] connection we were up in Tennessee one
[1:04:33] day and was going to a meeting and we
[1:04:36] stopped to get her something to eat and
[1:04:37] all and man driver started I had this
[1:04:40] big old German Shepherd up in the back
[1:04:42] of the truck and so hey I need to kind
[1:04:47] of divert around him because that was
[1:04:49] his truck and I don't didn't think he
[1:04:52] needed another driver you know
[1:04:56] here comes this black guy gets out of
[1:04:59] his car
[1:05:00] walks up that dog runs into him Wow boy
[1:05:05] he was ill he got within about two foot
[1:05:10] of that guy oh lord if he jumps him I'm
[1:05:16] going out to happen you know I'm
[1:05:19] thinking things over I read I got run
[1:05:21] warned
[1:05:22] yeah about that tunnel that guy he just
[1:05:26] looked at that dog the dog just stopped
[1:05:32] and just got a bewildered look on his
[1:05:34] eyes he said lay the hell dogless laid
[1:05:44] down I said rotate him do it see there's
[1:05:49] a connection of us human being is
[1:05:51] already in the big we are the offspring
[1:05:53] of God where they're children of God
[1:05:55] there's people that have gifts like that
[1:05:57] to where they can do it brother Tatum
[1:05:59] I've seen him with a dog one day German
[1:06:01] Shepherd and he just walked right up
[1:06:03] ladies hand and said why black he said
[1:06:06] you just lay down there see we've seen
[1:06:10] things some of you have seen greater
[1:06:13] things because you were there with a
[1:06:15] prophet and saw the dead raised the sick
[1:06:17] healed all right I take whatever little
[1:06:20] bit of ounce I can get of understanding
[1:06:23] of helping to me now and I believe it
[1:06:28] would you see this message is the
[1:06:31] message to bring
[1:06:33] eternal life in body spirit and soul
[1:06:44] well where do we go start believing in
[1:06:47] saying thank you Lord see to me that's
[1:06:50] why it says that's the purpose
[1:06:53] when Paul put that in the word he put in
[1:06:56] the word if there is a drawing all the
[1:06:59] way back to Adam this come all the way
[1:07:01] down to where we are but he said it's
[1:07:03] going on because he would stand out and
[1:07:06] freeze and prophesy he prophesied of the
[1:07:09] future he never reached no change of the
[1:07:11] body and stuff like that Paul didn't do
[1:07:14] it would the one that I'm glad though
[1:07:18] did because the Lord Jesus not only
[1:07:21] raised eternal life in body I mean in
[1:07:26] soul he raised eternal life in body and
[1:07:29] spirit to go with that soul now we've
[1:07:34] got a pool the eternal life that Adam
[1:07:39] had in the garden that day says here it
[1:07:42] is the day you receive the new birth you
[1:07:49] received eternal life and you say here
[1:07:52] it is Lord this is the pool that I've
[1:07:55] had are you listening the pool the
[1:07:58] things that are happening that's why it
[1:08:00] says it like they without us could not
[1:08:02] be made perfect we're not going to pull
[1:08:05] them up and preach sermons to them know
[1:08:08] when they walk here they're gonna walk
[1:08:09] here and eat in the eternity we're gonna
[1:08:14] have 3040 days for a little while to do
[1:08:18] a whole lot that's why I don't argue
[1:08:20] with anybody about these doctrines and
[1:08:23] ideas or what they're trying to make out
[1:08:24] of brother Branham and coming back and
[1:08:26] do it the Bible says he's gonna be here
[1:08:29] 30 40 days the Prophet says it anyway
[1:08:33] see we're gonna have a time that we can
[1:08:36] rejoice they do because we're gonna
[1:08:40] already be into a kingdom
[1:08:45] now listen one saying finish the thought
[1:08:52] after we leave there won't be any
[1:08:56] Gentile pooling won't be any draw into
[1:09:01] any more Gentiles
[1:09:04] even the foolish virgin will have
[1:09:06] already reached their positional things
[1:09:08] in life there won't be any Gentile
[1:09:11] pulling anymore it'll be finished you'll
[1:09:15] turn to the Jews and there stands
[1:09:19] Moses and Elijah right standing there it
[1:09:28] says this is my beloved son and then one
[1:09:30] pleased to dwell here you him those Jews
[1:09:35] will hear the word of God they'll
[1:09:41] receive your people for here you know
[1:09:44] 120 I mean they're the 144,000 will
[1:09:53] receive eternal life into their soul but
[1:09:59] now watch the eternal life in their soul
[1:10:02] is only a gift and parted they did not
[1:10:06] go through justification same case in
[1:10:08] the baptismal holy ghost to get it like
[1:10:10] you can die so you know where their
[1:10:12] connection is they're waiting on me in
[1:10:14] you they're saying over there how long
[1:10:18] how long come on see all of that is my
[1:10:22] whole point because I asked him I said
[1:10:27] well why does it say it like that
[1:10:31] the day without us cannot be made
[1:10:35] perfect I understand the wording of
[1:10:38] perfections and the IRS's and all the
[1:10:40] different things but he said it made a
[1:10:44] connection all the way back to Adam in
[1:10:49] the garden so everything is waiting
[1:10:55] Roman day read it
[1:10:57] all creation is waiting Suns in doubt
[1:11:00] waiting on the manifestation of the sons
[1:11:02] and daughters of God what if the word
[1:11:04] manifests me to make no waiting on God
[1:11:07] to make it known we saw it come on
[1:11:10] church we're not making brother branham
[1:11:13] is some kind of a god or some kind of
[1:11:15] different things he was a human being
[1:11:16] but we saw some of your seen in person
[1:11:20] the dead raised the sick healed and the
[1:11:23] things but they saw God for a moment
[1:11:32] well you know I'm in bad shape if we
[1:11:36] think that was all of God no why can't
[1:11:41] we desire to move on in God and get away
[1:11:45] from our little things of ideas and well
[1:11:48] I don't know whether I said or no
[1:11:49] brother dev appreciated a guy I don't
[1:11:52] know what he's talking about I'm talking
[1:11:55] about plainly if you just go back and
[1:11:57] listen to the message you'll hear me
[1:11:59] just say the same thing over again they
[1:12:02] jump into ministers meeting one time and
[1:12:04] and they said we want you to get up here
[1:12:07] and explain yourself I said I ain't
[1:12:11] getting up how's the card if I got up
[1:12:14] fire we'd have a lengthy time for us to
[1:12:17] sit and me say over again exactly what
[1:12:21] you know I've already said so I'm gonna
[1:12:25] do it I just refused cuz that's what it
[1:12:29] would have been I'd had to spend hours
[1:12:31] telling over again what I had taught all
[1:12:34] them years and see they got real quiet
[1:12:36] because they knew that was right they
[1:12:40] didn't pursue it anymore because they
[1:12:43] knew what I'd already talked so we had a
[1:12:46] good time we man
[1:12:47] but listen Church one more time God
[1:12:51] started in Adam Jesus was the second
[1:12:55] Adam we are not a third Adam but we are
[1:13:00] the bride of Jesus Christ the sons and
[1:13:05] daughters of a living God as bride now
[1:13:09] which one you'd rather be
[1:13:12] I'm happy to be called the bride across
[1:13:16] I'm happy to be the point that I can say
[1:13:20] Jesus Christ is my husband my savior my
[1:13:24] all and all I don't have to wait on
[1:13:27] anybody else I just move on with God
[1:13:30] let's stand together just think on these
[1:13:34] things but that's a pool of drawing
[1:13:40] power when that Lord Jesus Christ went
[1:13:45] through that death Berlin resurrection
[1:13:47] he rose that connected him to ever
[1:13:50] born-again believer but now listen it
[1:13:53] didn't connect him to just ever
[1:13:54] born-again believe it connect him to
[1:13:56] ever person in the Old Testament this is
[1:14:00] well eternal life an opportunity do you
[1:14:07] have that eternal life that's the main
[1:14:11] thing because he can't pull you you
[1:14:14] don't know what I'm talking about it all
[1:14:15] on the pool until you get born again and
[1:14:18] then you find out hey yeah hey something
[1:14:21] kind of pulling me why is he picking why
[1:14:24] is it sometimes you pick up the Bible or
[1:14:27] something and you turn to one certain
[1:14:30] scripture and you start reading and
[1:14:34] after a while you realize I've been
[1:14:37] thinking on that scripture all week see
[1:14:40] it starts connecting to pulling us to
[1:14:44] the point of perfection in Jesus Christ
[1:14:47] amen
