[1:28] to Oklahoma and Kansas and Arkansas
[1:34] and you wants to go to Bass Pro shoping
[1:37] in Springfield Missouri so I'm going to
[1:40] let her do what she wants to
[1:42] do
[1:44] hallelujah amen to that that's where
[1:46] I'll take my nap that's

[1:54] doing the next Sunday January the 5th
[1:58] okay everybody got that so keep them in
[2:01] your prayers now we're talking about
[2:03] Temperance what I thought about today is
[2:05] is just before we leave for about three
[2:08] weeks cuz the next weekend is a
[2:09] ministers meeting down in Florida so
[2:11] we're probably going to be going to that
[2:13] so we're going to let the prophet and he
[2:17] does just you watch his progression in
[2:20] his ministry how that he progresses
[2:22] through on on temperence and and uhu
[2:25] fruits of the spirit and things that
[2:27] we're supposed to show cuz watch what he
[2:29] says here we're just going to read faith
[2:31] is a substance 1951 you'll see it here
[2:35] says no matter what outward
[2:36] demonstration you
[2:37] give as long as the inward here is the
[2:40] holy spirit it'll be the fruits of the
[2:42] spirit remember we talked about that
[2:44] Wednesday night we're the fruit on the
[2:45] tree of life so whatever fruit is is
[2:48] bore on the tree of life if it's life
[2:50] we're going to Bear life if it's death
[2:52] then we're still on the other tree of
[2:55] knowledge of Good and Evil it'll be the
[2:57] fruits of the spirit longsuffering
[2:58] goodness meekness patient gist Faith
[3:00] Temperance now watch what he
[3:03] says Satan can copy any kind of a gift
[3:08] right any kind of a manifestation but he
[3:11] can't
[3:12] love so we see the Capstone is love but
[3:16] remember that love started at Faith
[3:18] because that give you perfect Faith
[3:22] inside your soul right so that give you
[3:24] perfect love you have that's why brother
[3:26] BR
[3:28] said everybody's got a uh have a has a
[3:31] problem with when brother Brown went
[3:33] behind the curtain of time and they're
[3:36] saying that we' got to have perfect
[3:38] Faith here that brother bram's got to
[3:39] come back and speak that perfect Faith
[3:41] to us but I've always been this way
[3:43] about it brother brandham he goes across
[3:46] the curtain of time we know that that's
[3:48] the people cuz he said are these all
[3:51] randoms and he said no he said they're
[3:53] your converts converts all right uh born
[3:58] again I told her asked a brother one
[4:00] time that was that was saying Oh Brother
[4:02] R's got to come back to bring perfect
[4:05] Faith but if you read in the in the
[4:10] message brother Bram asked the
[4:13] angel well who are these people he said
[4:15] well there your convert right he said
[4:18] this is where perfect love is well now
[4:22] what was the every person in that
[4:25] Dimension had one thing in common they
[4:28] were white black red green orange short
[4:30] tall he said they had had red hair they
[4:33] had brown hair they had you know all the
[4:36] different colors but what did they have
[4:38] one thing in common they had the new
[4:40] birth while they were here on Earth they
[4:43] had the new birth and was born again
[4:44] under brother R's Ministry so that is
[4:47] perfect
[4:48] Faith that's the only way they could get
[4:50] there so it's not that we got to go
[4:52] there to get perfect Faith or brother
[4:54] ry's got to come back here to give us
[4:56] perfect faith when you're born again you
[4:57] get perfect faith
[5:00] right it's just that's just as simple as
[5:02] you can make it you get perfect faith
[5:04] when you're born again or perfect love
[5:06] but what has to happen is like I've
[5:08] always said You' got that capsule you're
[5:10] the capsule this is Bor this was off the
[5:12] tree of knowledge of Good and
[5:14] Evil all right so this is what we got to
[5:17] fight we got to fight man's knowledge we
[5:19] got to fight man's Temperance we got to
[5:21] fight cuz there is a Godly Temperance
[5:24] did you read what we were reading here
[5:25] what God all the things that the Lord
[5:27] was a lightning bolt and he was he was
[5:30] he gets mad he
[5:32] hates God hates sin so he has he has a
[5:36] temperament about him God had listen
[5:40] that's where these things come
[5:42] from
[5:44] these virtues come from almighty God
[5:47] they don't come from the devil but he
[5:49] says look he says Satan can copy any
[5:51] kind of a gift any kind of a
[5:53] manifestation but he can't love that's
[5:56] right see Satan can't love you see a
[5:58] humble man loving good to his neighbor
[5:59] good citizen good fell and a good man
[6:01] and a Christian man full of love and
[6:02] humility you watch that
[6:05] man you watch
[6:07] him and that's what you got to do you
[6:09] watch him that's right he's good
[6:11] charitable longsuffering you can talk
[6:13] about him it's all right he forgives you
[6:14] don't make any difference there that's
[6:17] the real man keep your eye on him that
[6:19] man Bears what bears
[6:21] fruit he's the
[6:23] example but remember he goes on and says
[6:26] that don't matter how much you shout in
[6:27] church and all those things like that
[6:29] it's going to come down to where it's
[6:30] going to be perfect love hidden life in
[6:33] Christ 1955 and the fruit of the spirit
[6:35] is love joy peace long suffering
[6:36] goodness dealing this patience meanness
[6:38] Temperance all right fruits of the
[6:40] spirit God knows today that's what the
[6:42] Holiness people need now they probably
[6:45] thought they already had
[6:48] that the Pentecostal people the the the
[6:51] Holiness people that's what they were
[6:52] supposed to be living but brother Bar's
[6:54] telling them in 1955 you got away from
[6:58] that remember what brother Dale was in
[7:00] the Bible study you know about the the
[7:02] messenger coming to the End of the Age
[7:04] Paul rebuked the true the people that
[7:07] were born again he rebuked those people
[7:09] for falling away from their first love
[7:11] now brother Brandon was rebuking the
[7:13] Pentecostals cuz at one time they had
[7:15] love joy peace long suffering goodness
[7:17] gentl but remember he said now they
[7:18] fight with a temper like a buz saww well
[7:20] that's Temperance they did not have the
[7:23] virtues to carry them on on up the
[7:25] pyramid problem was they didn't have
[7:27] anybody to preach them
[7:29] all right brother Bram came to preach
[7:32] these virtues that now they're a
[7:33] requirement since they've been revealed
[7:36] God knows today that what the Holiness
[7:37] people need and also the calvinist all
[7:40] of them needs today is more fruit of the
[7:42] spirit he didn't say more Spirit he said
[7:44] more fruits of the spirit all of them
[7:47] needs more fruit of the spirit more
[7:49] lives to prove
[7:58] it
[8:00] all right let's go around here and
[8:01] here's one of the greatest hindrances
[8:02] that there in the church today right
[8:04] here Edmonton or everywhere not Edmonton
[8:06] I didn't mean to say that I mean Prince
[8:08] Albert among other people everywhere is
[8:12] fear there's that word
[8:15] fear but love perfect love cast us out
[8:18] fear so the reason you're fearful is
[8:20] because the right Temperance of
[8:23] love we think a lot of times Temperance
[8:25] is we got to have control our ungodly
[8:27] temper well that's true but watch what
[8:28] brother Brown says the right Temperance
[8:31] of love that has never entered
[8:35] yet so it's not been preached it's 1956
[8:38] he's about four or five years away from
[8:40] preaching the statute of perfect man see
[8:43] when there's real love all fear passes
[8:46] away all
[8:52] right by your fruits you'll know them
[8:54] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[8:56] goodness meekness patience long
[8:57] suffering Faith Temperance all these
[8:59] find qualities that the world is looking
[9:00] to see in the Christian
[9:02] church they put the scope of God by
[9:05] Baptist Methodist Pentecostal nazarine
[9:07] all that they're looking for God all
[9:13] right weeping is not fruit listen
[9:15] shouting is not fruits for the
[9:18] spirit shouting at somebody is not
[9:24] either
[9:28] yeah we have 20 you were talking about
[9:31] all the things that um the fruits of the
[9:33] spirit are but there are denominational
[9:36] people that are
[9:38] happy it's hard to they're happy but
[9:42] like brother Brown said where the love
[9:44] of God is not that you're all Levy
[9:47] Dey that's not the love of God remember
[9:51] the love of God is corrected if the
[9:53] words presented to them and they turn it
[9:54] down they don't have that cross them up
[9:58] they just have nor normal they just have
[10:00] normal human
[10:03] love you can have every one of them one
[10:05] of them not not be born again absolutely
[10:08] you can have a bit of a piece of it you
[10:10] can't have all of it you can't have all
[10:12] somewhere brother R said in the statute
[10:14] of per man said you'll show your true
[10:16] colors all right so um you know and
[10:20] there is like Brother Richard Wilson
[10:22] There was a man at work for him at the
[10:24] bearing place there that he was so meek
[10:26] and Mild that that he said I believe you
[10:29] could have told him one week that we
[10:31] just not going to pay you nothing we're
[10:33] not going to make pay you a paycheck you
[10:34] going to work 40 hours we're not going
[10:35] to pay he said he' probably say yeah
[10:37] okay fine thank you you know that's to
[10:40] me that's just the temperamental part of
[10:42] what comes across in this guy because
[10:43] remember we were uh mom and I were
[10:46] talking about a certain family line and
[10:47] and your family line means a
[10:49] lot there's a certain family line of of
[10:52] two certain families in in Gillsville
[10:55] and which were K to one of them and
[10:59] they're K to each other and they have
[11:01] temper like you wouldn't
[11:04] believe and if they were born again
[11:07] they'd still have a little bit of that
[11:08] on this side but God would take care of
[11:12] that because they would come to the word
[11:13] and the word would mellow them out but
[11:15] the problem is they're not born again
[11:17] and they fight like cats and
[11:19] dogs but you have to look see shouting
[11:22] is not the fruit of the
[11:25] spirit cuz look watch weeping is not
[11:27] this fruit of the spirit but love joy
[11:30] now he don't mean just love joy P that
[11:32] ain't like I said last couple weeks
[11:36] ago sorrow brings
[11:41] Joy sorrow brings Joy do you think Jesus
[11:46] in his Humanity was joyful that he was
[11:48] going to the Cross no I don't think so
[11:51] but that thing that was inside of
[11:55] him that tie poost because remember he
[11:58] said not my will but thy will be done
[12:00] now we've got to get to where we come to
[12:01] that where our will would be to fight
[12:05] back and we do because we'll overcome
[12:07] that little that that thing inside of us
[12:09] now don't worry about me calling it a
[12:11] thing I told him wherever I was
[12:12] preaching couple weeks ago I said look
[12:14] the Bible calls you the thing that Holy
[12:17] thing that'll be born in you that was
[12:18] God that was the almighty so so uh you
[12:22] know what
[12:23] Gabriel didn't have a revelation of
[12:26] exactly who that was cuz he was an old
[12:28] Testament he was he was the the Jewish
[12:31] Messenger right but Michael would know
[12:33] who he was Michael would have knew that
[12:35] was Christ or that would have been him
[12:37] but um but the salutation was that Holy
[12:42] thing so anyway that thing that's born
[12:43] in
[12:45] you but love joy peace longsuffering
[12:48] remember when you read that You' got to
[12:50] read that with a whole different look
[12:52] than people in the
[12:54] world I hope that's what you're getting
[12:56] from this this is not just normal people
[12:58] right
[12:59] right this is not right this is not
[13:02] normal
[13:05] love because brother R said it breaks
[13:07] down to it goes to to AG goth of love
[13:10] which is the love of God top of the
[13:11] pyramid down to filal love which you
[13:14] love for your wife then it keeps going
[13:16] down and brother Brown said because of
[13:18] the Fall it keeps going to lust and then
[13:20] it keeps going to perversion it's the
[13:22] same thing you know it's like I said
[13:24] many times before we always say I love
[13:26] to go hunting or I love to read the I
[13:29] love do
[13:32] you I mean is that real love no that's
[13:36] not real love it's just something that
[13:38] you desire to do we ought to just say we
[13:41] desire to go hunting or we desire to go
[13:43] fishing because it's not a love we use
[13:45] that word so
[13:46] loosely but that true love is what's
[13:49] sitting here today in the I don't want
[13:52] to even say the message of the hour but
[13:53] in the New Birth that you have that's
[13:56] where that love is residing that love is
[13:58] there nowhere else in the
[14:01] world right if not if it is then they're
[14:05] all going to heaven right
[14:09] that's that word love has been so eroded
[14:12] till now you go to a funeral and it
[14:14] doesn't matter like I said it doesn't
[14:15] matter if the guy's a drunk and died a
[14:18] drunk he's going to heaven
[14:20] somehow no he's
[14:22] not no sorry he's not if he didn't
[14:25] repent right at the right at the end of
[14:27] his life no he's not
[14:29] like brother Brady stood up at time he
[14:30] said mine lived a drunk he died a drunk
[14:33] he's going to
[14:35] hell hold his family that at a funeral
[14:39] at a funeral at the man's funeral cuz
[14:41] they always say if there's anything
[14:42] anybody got to say before we you know
[14:45] let go the preacher gets up preach the
[14:47] guy in the glory you know and brother
[14:49] Brady knew
[14:50] him and brother Brady he said he told us
[14:54] this he stood he put his hand up he said
[14:56] I tell you he said I tell all of you he
[14:58] he said A man was a drunk he lived a
[15:01] drunk life he didn't do nothing but
[15:03] drink never went in a church that I know
[15:05] of and said if he didn't repent in the
[15:06] last minute of his life he's in hell
[15:08] right now and boy they didn't like it
[15:10] but you know
[15:14] what somehow the truth hurts that's
[15:16] right but love joy peace longsuffering
[15:19] don't get that as words we've got to go
[15:21] beyond we've got to see the
[15:23] Revelation that's behind love the
[15:25] Revelation that's behind Joy the
[15:27] Revelation that's behind peace the
[15:28] ration is behind
[15:30] longsuffering you can have
[15:32] peace and look like the world is just
[15:35] falling apart in your life you know
[15:38] that's when God's got a hold of you you
[15:40] not got you've not got a hold of your
[15:42] own
[15:43] feelings all
[15:44] right longsuffering goodness gentleness
[15:47] Faith meekness Temperance that's the
[15:49] fruits of the spirit that's what the
[15:50] spirit's fruits are all right now the
[15:53] reason we have these things they like to
[15:55] make organ well what he's saying is is
[15:57] talking about organization that's what
[15:59] we're talking about now organizational
[16:02] people sure you see people that are
[16:04] happy but you know what if they're not
[16:06] born again there's going to be a time
[16:08] when they ain't going to be real happy
[16:10] when we get out of here and go and go to
[16:12] glory in a Rapture and all hell breaks
[16:13] loose down here you'll see how joyful
[16:16] they are
[16:17] then I mean that's just the way it is so
[16:19] that's what I mean about God God is not
[16:22] God is a Jud he's a judge he's just he
[16:26] can't let somebody go to heaven a
[16:28] different way than somebody else go to
[16:29] heaven you all got to come the same way
[16:32] all right all nine gifts has to be
[16:35] working in the
[16:36] church and the fruits of the spirit is
[16:38] love joy Faith longsuffering gness
[16:41] patience goodness meekness Temperance
[16:42] there's the fruits of the spirit now if
[16:44] that look watch this now if that's
[16:47] operating in your life now watch what he
[16:50] says if that's operating in your life
[16:53] blessed be the name of the
[16:55] Lord but if some of it's there without
[16:58] the rest of it be careful your own
[17:00] Dangerous
[17:01] Ground see Satan can
[17:05] impersonate most anything that God does
[17:08] but you can tell it's not mixed with
[17:10] love or neither has it Faith the word
[17:14] being preached not profit them from
[17:16] being mixed with
[17:19] faith that's pretty good there I like
[17:21] that
[17:23] one what brother say we had to have
[17:26] substance faith and other words sub
[17:28] Faith was sub substance cuz the people
[17:30] go to church now in the denominational
[17:32] churches they're going by
[17:34] faith the faith that they see they
[17:37] believe that if they'll go to church or
[17:38] Paint The Barking Lot or if they believe
[17:40] they'll do that but you know what I was
[17:42] thinking coming down the road
[17:44] today it's
[17:47] Penance I I was as we were driving by I
[17:50] thought of a a man real nice man real
[17:52] good man don't believe it he I believe
[17:54] he's um for what he knows he's a nominal
[17:56] Christian and I drove by his house and I
[17:58] saw his car there but what they usually
[18:00] do is is they'll go to the Methodist
[18:02] Church and have a men's breakfast cuz I
[18:04] spoke at it one time they have a men's
[18:05] breakfast well they don't go back to
[18:07] church after that but see they felt
[18:08] they've done their Duty and the first
[18:11] thing came to my my mind was Penance
[18:14] they've done their Penance they went to
[18:16] that bre Men's breakfast under the under
[18:19] the umbrella of
[18:21] religion done their Duty for the day cuz
[18:25] Catholics and mass is the same way they
[18:26] don't go to church on Sunday unless they
[18:27] have mass on Sunday morning they'll go
[18:29] take mass and communion and they're gone
[18:32] same way that's the way that's the way
[18:33] it's happening now in message churches
[18:37] just be honest with
[18:42] you sorry about that but it
[18:51] happens you say look he's talking about
[18:54] the U Witch Doctors Jesus Never Said by
[18:57] their tongues you shall know them but by
[18:58] their fruits you shall know them
[19:00] Ephesians 5:1 say the fruit of the
[19:02] spirit is love joy peace long suffering
[19:03] goodness temp gentleness patience
[19:05] meanness faith and Temperance is that
[19:07] right there you are cuz what's happened
[19:09] is those
[19:10] people he said they're sincere what they
[19:13] cut
[19:14] theirself they throw their babies to the
[19:17] to the alligators to appease God it's
[19:19] just it's that Penance thing all
[19:25] right look he's talking about Esau watch
[19:28] the dad always said about Esau Esau if
[19:31] you took Esau's natural life versus
[19:35] Jacob's Natural Life you'd pick Esau
[19:37] every time I would he helped his poor
[19:41] old daddy he brought his daddy food
[19:44] right he done all the things that he was
[19:47] supposed to do he acted like he was in
[19:49] line but remember there was one thing he
[19:52] didn't have it was love for that
[19:53] Birthright now what's the birthright to
[19:55] a Christian the new birth
[19:59] so so what people will do is the Esau's
[20:01] of the world now good neighbor good life
[20:05] in the neighborhood Esau never harm
[20:07] nobody but Esau was of the devil why
[20:10] because he took that birth
[20:12] right cast it aside New Birth same way
[20:17] you present the gospel to people and
[20:18] they turn it down brother Bram said
[20:20] predestination off Jacob they came out
[20:24] of the same
[20:25] womb so they came from a Godly Mom and
[20:27] Daddy
[20:28] but Esau turned down the very thing a
[20:32] type of the new birth he turned it down
[20:34] but he was he would be a nominal chrisan
[20:37] now
[20:39] hey Jacob didn't do nothing but just
[20:41] kind of wander around
[20:43] and he was a Shyer all the way up a poor
[20:46] old father-in-law they were sitting
[20:48] there uh shying each
[20:53] other until uh until God got a hold of
[20:56] Jacob and then what Jacob had to have a
[20:58] name change you had to have a name
[20:59] change to Israel all
[21:04] right let's see a few going here he
[21:08] comes into the statue of perfect
[21:12] man let's get
[21:15] Temperance right here add Temperance oh
[21:18] my we've come to Temperance now you've
[21:20] got you've had Faith first have to have
[21:23] that to begin with then you add virtue
[21:25] to your faith if it's the right kind of
[21:27] virtue then you add knowledge if it's
[21:29] the right kind of knowledge now you're
[21:31] going to
[21:33] add
[21:37] Temperance right Temperance does not
[21:40] mean stop drinking alcohol no no
[21:43] Temperance doesn't mean alcohol cure not
[21:44] in this case this is Bible Temperance
[21:48] Holy Spirit Temperance that's what all
[21:49] these you must put Holy Spirit in front
[21:52] of it cuz it's the like I said in the in
[21:56] the sermon with the uh Genesis 126 to me
[21:59] this is a Genesis 126 man in full
[22:03] manifestation that's what that genesis6
[22:06] man had but it was eroded or like
[22:09] brother brand said it become blackened
[22:12] after the fall we couldn't get to
[22:16] that remember what I what I was telling
[22:18] you last Wednesday night man couldn't
[22:20] even get to the new birth until Jesus
[22:22] came did you not see what I said in in
[22:25] in the in the sermon there's no way you
[22:28] the new the new birth the the baptism of
[22:31] the Holy Ghost that he wanted everybody
[22:33] to come forth with man and human flesh
[22:36] women in human flesh with all these
[22:38] virtues totally working in their life
[22:41] that's what he wanted all right well
[22:43] that didn't happen because of the Fall
[22:45] which we know that the sin that sin had
[22:47] to come so he could come and pay the
[22:48] price to get us back to it well what did
[22:51] he do he brought all these gifts because
[22:55] remember Peter had them Paul had them
[22:59] James John all the apostles the 120 in
[23:03] the upper room even
[23:05] Mary was that the faith of the father so
[23:08] they had these things it's not that this
[23:09] is something new I told you this before
[23:12] this is not something new that's got to
[23:14] work in our life it's worked in Peter
[23:16] it's worked in James it's worked in Paul
[23:18] it's worked in Mary it worked in whoever
[23:20] was in that upper room all right but
[23:22] down during the ages it was so eroded or
[23:25] or why we don't need that till the Holy
[23:28] Spirit couldn't work brother BR said
[23:30] he's been bound for 2,000 years under
[23:32] what the door of Creeds and dogmas well
[23:35] what is Creeds and dogmas
[23:38] against preaching Temperance well you
[23:40] have a hey the Pentecostals they got a
[23:43] terrible
[23:44] temper I used to work with one talk
[23:47] about the Lord and cuss you out the next
[23:48] minute I mean didn't bother them a
[23:52] bit but this is Holy Spirit Temperance
[23:55] that's just one of the lust of the flesh
[23:57] but we're talking about about Holy
[23:58] Spirit
[24:00] Temperance that means how to control
[24:02] your tongue not be a tler how to control
[24:05] your temper not fly off every time
[24:07] anybody speaks cross to you oh my boy a
[24:10] lot of us going to fall off before we
[24:11] get started aren't we cuz remember he
[24:14] had a bad
[24:15] temper he would have been a murderer if
[24:18] God hadn't helped
[24:19] him yes he would have he put them
[24:22] bullets in that gun and he met them boys
[24:25] on that road and he had ever how many
[24:27] shells in that gun and he said I
[24:29] unloaded the
[24:32] gun and I'm sure at that time it was a
[24:35] bolt action so he was sitting there
[24:36] click B he was trying to get one in
[24:38] other words what I'm saying was he
[24:40] didn't just shoot one time and quit he
[24:41] was trying to get one of them to fire
[24:44] while them boys was running off right
[24:46] remember he put He said I put all the
[24:47] bullets back in the gun and he said
[24:49] every one of them fired well see he had
[24:51] a temper remember he said the teacher
[24:52] told him to tie the string around his
[24:54] finger with a knot you know tie a knot
[24:56] said you remember he got frustrated said
[24:58] he was untie ti ti ti said he just throw
[25:00] this thing down and went to fighting
[25:01] well you know what he had a
[25:04] temper he was a human but he overcame
[25:09] that he didn't get mad at the boy he
[25:12] didn't get mad at the guy that was going
[25:13] to try to kill him he said something
[25:16] took over that's what you and I have got
[25:18] to look at something must take over
[25:21] that's right all right now if it doesn't
[25:22] then that's where we need to work on if
[25:24] something doesn't take over like I told
[25:26] you about you know saying the bad words
[25:28] that I used to say so
[25:30] frequently and and then the Lord sto him
[25:33] stopping you know what he knew that I
[25:35] didn't want to do
[25:36] it but by my own human self I was so
[25:39] quick to do it that it was just a it was
[25:42] just a reaction and he wouldn't let me
[25:44] say it well see when he did that that
[25:46] showed me at least that God was trying
[25:48] to keep me straight you know trying to
[25:50] give me a little virtue a little
[25:51] knowledge maybe a little bit of
[25:52] temperance all right but a lot of us are
[25:55] going to fall off before we get started
[25:57] aren't we see then we wonder why God is
[25:59] not in his church doing Miracles and
[26:01] things that they used to
[26:03] do book of Acts book of Acts had these
[26:07] virtues working in their life all right
[26:11] now that we got to get back to that
[26:12] before we can get to anything else we
[26:14] want to speak the word and and have the
[26:16] manifestation of the third pull well you
[26:18] got to have this first before the
[26:21] manifestation because remember power
[26:22] without character is satanic so this is
[26:25] character this is character power with
[26:28] character is fit to rule all right
[26:32] now add these things add Temperance old
[26:35] temperence how to answer in kindness
[26:37] when wrath is spoke to you somebody says
[26:39] you bunch of Holy Rollers down there
[26:40] don't jump up and roll your sleeves up
[26:42] now see not that but talk with Godly
[26:44] love Temperance kindness is that the way
[26:46] you want to be congregation says amen
[26:49] when you're red upon R not back let him
[26:51] be your
[26:52] example they said if thou be the Son of
[26:54] God turn these stones into bread he
[26:56] could have done it and showed he was was
[26:57] God but he had
[26:58] Temperance when they called him be above
[27:01] he said I'll forgive you for that that's
[27:02] right they pulled a handful of the beard
[27:04] out of his face and spit on his face
[27:05] come down off the cross he said father
[27:07] forgive them they don't know what
[27:08] they're doing when he had the gift he
[27:11] knowed all things for in him was the
[27:12] fullness of the godhead botling they had
[27:14] seen him perform Miracles by telling
[27:16] people what was wrong with him and so
[27:17] forth like that they put a rag around
[27:18] his head and around his eyes and hit him
[27:20] on the head with a stick and said
[27:21] prophesy tell us who he him we'll
[27:23] believe you see he had
[27:25] Temperance now if you got it like that
[27:27] add it to your faith if you still blow
[27:29] up and Sass and fuss and stew and carry
[27:31] on uh-huh you ain't got no you can't add
[27:34] that cuz it won't add it won't vulcanize
[27:38] you couldn't take a piece of rubber you
[27:39] know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron
[27:41] it just won't work that's got to be
[27:43] flexible just like the rubber is see
[27:45] when your faith and your Temperance
[27:47] becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost
[27:48] Temperance that he had not that you mama
[27:51] had or your daddy had that he had then
[27:53] it will vulcanize with him you're added
[27:55] to it when your virtue is like his
[27:57] virtue than add to it when your
[27:58] knowledge is like his knowledge I come
[28:00] to do thy will oh God see with the
[28:02] father's word he defeated every devil
[28:04] Heaven and Earth will pass you away but
[28:05] the word will not when you got that kind
[28:08] of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your
[28:09] faith when you got the right kind of
[28:10] temperance like he had it'll vulcanize
[28:13] if you hadn't just a manmade halfway
[28:15] soued up belief or Temperance oh I ought
[28:17] to slap him down but maybe I better not
[28:20] cuz they might put my name in the paper
[28:22] about it that ain't the kind of
[28:24] temperance he's talking about don't try
[28:25] to add that it won't work but when you
[28:27] can really with the sweetness from your
[28:29] heart forgive every man hold your peace
[28:31] let it be done see then it'll vulcanize
[28:33] you can add that to your faith no wonder
[28:36] of the church is so short isn't that
[28:38] right no wonder I'd say repent and be
[28:39] baptized the Bible said in the name of
[28:40] Jesus Christ strict traran trinitarian
[28:42] don't believe that that that in Christ
[28:44] he's a Jesus name he's a Jesus only Look
[28:46] Out Boy I don't know about your
[28:48] Temperance right now why don't you come
[28:50] say let's reason together brother
[28:51] Brandon I'd like to hear this explained
[28:53] see then come down and listen to it then
[28:55] it put right before you and you you can
[28:57] walk away well we'll get to that in just
[28:59] a minute in godl but see when you fly
[29:01] loose want to jump at every conclusion
[29:03] uh-huh that's not it you haven't got
[29:06] Bible Temperance yet when you do that
[29:08] how to answer
[29:09] back now to me that's it right
[29:13] there how to answer
[29:16] back that's the whole thing how how to
[29:20] answer back is the whole that's the
[29:21] whole part of temperance cuz remember
[29:24] it's going to be tested so you're not
[29:26] going to go through life and God's going
[29:28] to say well I'm going to keep all this
[29:29] temperament away from you I'm going to
[29:31] keep all these people with tempers away
[29:32] from you and you're not going to get cut
[29:33] off in them road somewhere and you're
[29:35] not going to get this or somebody's not
[29:37] going to jump in line no it will come
[29:41] but he says how to answer back to that
[29:44] cuz it's how you react right you can't
[29:47] control how that person reacts right but
[29:50] you can control how you react and that's
[29:53] the greatest thing that I can say to you
[29:55] is let's have temperance
[29:57] to who we can answer
[30:02] back in the same Holy Spirit Temperance
[30:05] that God would answer back hey let me
[30:07] tell you something he's longsuffering
[30:08] with you and me so let's be
[30:12] longsuffering with each other and with
[30:13] people
[30:14] right A lot of people act like to do cuz
[30:17] they're not born again that's just a
[30:19] bottom line they act like they do cuz
[30:21] they got new birth and you can't help
[30:23] them do that you sure you can live the
[30:25] life that's the greatest thing you can
[30:26] do is live the life in front of of them
[30:28] and and and you know speak in peace
[30:31] speak in faith it don't mean for
[30:33] somebody to run over you that know what
[30:35] that means but it means to how do you
[30:38] answer
[30:39] back like Daddy said a guy breaks in
[30:42] your house if he's coming for my wife
[30:45] I'm going to shoot him if I have to but
[30:47] then I'm going to get down and pray for
[30:48] his soul and pray for God to heal his
[30:50] The Bullet Hole you know so Lord bless
[30:53] you have Temperance you definitely need
[30:55] it in this time Christmas stuff going on
[30:58] so let's have
[31:00] temper
