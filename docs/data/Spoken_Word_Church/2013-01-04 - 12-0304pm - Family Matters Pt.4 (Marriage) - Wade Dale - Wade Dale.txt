everything's already buding out getting getting green and we just pray that there's another a snowstorm come cuz usually in Georgia about March 14th or somewhere in there we have a snowstorm if we're going to have one so let's just pray that this thing will go right on into uh into a beautiful Springtime so let's bow our heads before we get started we'll read 1 Peter 3 verse 1-7 dear heavenly father we come again Lord as as just empty vessel that you would just fill us up father and give us something Lord for the people that truly we would be Lord one with you father that we would be closer to you that we would be closer to our spouse closer to our children closer to all individuals in the church Lord we'd all just draw closer together in you father we ask you to forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make Lord just bless us and be with us take care of us in the furth of this service Lord you be Lord the one that takes preeminence and takes over and speaks the word that has to be spoken and as they are spoken Lord that you will Quicken the ears of the hear that they may hear what the spirit says to the churches father give us Lord our daily bread today Lord forgive us of our trespasses be with us Lord the sick ones that are among us and the ones that are away from us we ask you just be with them Lord be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields Lord we always try to remember them Lord that You' be with them and give them a special blessing for their labor father be with us keep us we love you Lord your blessed name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and if brother Joe and him listening in we we want to say that we miss brother Joe we miss miss uh sister Gail and and all those that are away from us for a time for for sickness and I know brother Joe he's ready to go he's he's got to go to flly of California in a couple weeks to visit his his daughter he had that planned already so let's just pray that the Lord will make that thing heal so fast and and no infection and and that he will be um that he'll be able to go out and visit his daughter in California so we just pray that uh that the Lord will bless each and every every one of you all right let's read in First Peter 3 in like manner let wives be subject to their own husbands so that if some are disobedient to the word they may without a word be gained through the conduct of their wives having seen your conduct chased with fear whose decorations let it not be that external one of braiding of hair and putting on of gold chains or wearing of apparel but decorate the hidden man of the heart with what is Incorruptible a Meek and quiet Spirit which is very precious in the sight of God for thus formly also those holy women who hoped in God adorned themselves being subject to their own husbands as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose children you are become doing good and not fearing any Terror in like manner husbands dwell according to knowledge with the female as the weaker vessel bestowing honor as being also joint hirs of the gracious Gift of Life in order that your prayers may not be hindered you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the to the reading of the word that was out of the emphatic diglot um it's a neat little read it comes from uh actually probably you need to let a couple of Jehovah Witnesses come into your house cuz they got these yeah ask them for these and then let some ask them to leave so you ain't going to share with them U well they just give me the the book no they just going they ain't going they're going to they're going to leave anyway so I we were starting this morning talking about vows and and you know being co-equal and all that and I I wanted to look up byproduct again and brother dick brought me one which is I had seen it on the book back there but it never dawned on me but a byproduct of gas is diesel fuel for many years before that that's why a diesel motor was created because they had so much diesel fuel they didn't know what to do to get rid of it when when Terence and I first got in chicken business chicken wings were about 5 cents a pound or you just throw them away they were like offall they were just like oxtails and pig ears but now you buy them for $2 a pound cuz everybody likes buffalo wings never heard Where the Buffalo came in actually it was in Buffalo New York where that came in but see now the byproduct of that chicken is the wing which is now actually cost more than parts of the chicken they come off of same way with gas and Diesel look at your diesel pump we're at $4 a gallon on diesel and only 360 for gas so a byproduct can really be the same or better all right so that's the same way now don't you sisters get to thinking that you brother that's why I didn't want to say that don't count yourself as diesel fuel all Smoky and oily and all that stuff but just as a okay have a little fun have a little fun byproduct is a secondary product derived from a manufacturing process or chemical reaction it is not the primary product or service being produced Adam on the sixth day but it's a byproduct of that and it can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste and then there's your uh examples for that but Adam came as a person God fellowship with Adam because God was lonely he fellowship with Adam and because Adam was lonely God said I need to make something for that but creation was over right God couldn't start creating again his creation was ended on the sixth day right he rested on the seventh and in the seventh day we were talking about the Millennium last night in the seventh days where man fell in that rest God took a rest but he took a rib out of Adam made a byproduct called Adam not Eve called Adam and then she was to do what reproduce Adam amen Adam couldn't reproduce Adam by himself Christ can't reproduce Christ by himself Christ needs you and I I didn't say that he did right amen he did he said he needed us for reproduction right and then we read the quotes about where it was in part of redemption that's what part of redemption is because some woman let's just be honest some woman had to bring you into the world literally bring you into the world so that God could speak to you right amen ever how it happened think of it how your mom and dads came together right your grandparents came together and you don't even know the story of the great great grandparents that God brought from this one to this one and brought them down and and bumped into each other at the at a grocery store somewhere young kids never even seen each other didn't know each other day their life all of a sudden they fall in love they get married and Here Comes Your Dad yeah then your dad does the same thing he meet somebody he's over somewhere off somewhere not even thinking about it and all of a sudden you know you walking down the hallway we football coach one day you walking down your hallway football coach one day and this little girl walks by all right never know actually she she come after me I there a quote to that yeah there a quote to that yes you'll tell I sit online yeah but that's the way it happened I wasn't looking for Jim I had a girlfriend right Janet it was Janet's sister brother how know was that it was Debbie and we just kind of didn't we kind of were friends and didn't really know what we was going to do and then all of a sudden this girl comes into my life from the backside you know nobody I knew and she had to run away from home she had to run away from home she actually jumped out of her mother's house out of a window in Atlanta and her dad and stepmom met her at a at a shaking U taking Shake in uh on South Cob Drive a week later a week later she had lived a week out in the woods and different places but they took her back to Homer well I have never met her if she'd have stayed down there with her mama and maretta so all the things that we got that coming together you Adam and Eve was really easy yeah there really wasn't a choice he didn't have a few to look at to look at but when she came out of him though the what's the first thing he said she is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh and they commune together in a relationship talking with God the three people God Adam and Eve all right three that's what we were talking about you know the the double Covenant had to come apart had to come I mean everything had to come apart because of the double Covenant in what Eve done by coming out from under her head and done what she did then then woman had to come down under a different a different calling right man's calling and women's calling was right here they were to be co-equal amen but afterwards the double Covenant had to come in and when I do this that doesn't make you're not a door man you're not something lower than man okay cuz we're supposed to hold you back up Christ doesn't kick us around act like doesn't treat us like a doormat right all right he chastens us though amen right sometimes he talks a little Stern to us okay that's not a problem with that amen but when you got this Covenant though you the Covenant is that the male is to be the head well the head's up here and the body's down here all right so the male is the head as a figure head as a part of the body of Christ we all are right here amen so let's don't gloat about this up here because this is Jesus Christ and this is the bride GL but when it said join HS what does that do it brings you right here man brings you right back together right and through female procreation what happened we all got here so let's look at the four loves again just to kind of go back through agap love is the love of God Divine love or perfect love everybody got that that is the new birth eternal life you can call it the logos you can call it the Christ whatever that is the love of God Amen cuz what did he do with that he was totally unselfish with it he gave it to us right he didn't keep it for himself amen remember when you go through charity if you read that charity you read that's what he did to you at your new birth right he gave you those things all right and we may read them in a minute again but filal love is is the love that unfolds from AG love filal love comes down and it's real close I said close it's not AG love but it's close cuz you can love cuz brother B said you know I love you made it so much I just want to pull you inside of it physically he knows you know can't do that but I know what he was doing he was want to commune so much with her till he never wanted her to part away from him he wanted her to be right there up close to him and that's what true love is and I know we kid and joke about you know being in separate places and all that but but boy what a communion when you get back together so that's where the number three comes in so number three is just a part of us human our procreating the thing that we do to to as husband and wife and like I told you before last week that there's only there's only the only way you're supposed to have any kind of sexual relationship for all of us in here even the young ones is to be a husband and a wife amen everything outside of that everything outside of that is either fornication if you're not married or adultery if you are married so that's just pretty cut and dry the only relationship you're supposed to have is with your spouse no other woman no touching No Woman No Kissing No Woman No hugging no woman now see then you say well what about you kiss your momma on the head that's parent child that's story it doesn't hurt for me but I don't kiss mama like I kissed my wife there's ways that we have to look and that's why God that's why God knew we would be living under this people so this is not something we need to sweep under a rug no we need to talk about these things we need to bring these things out there's nothing dirty about sexual relationship between a husband and a wife amen see there's nothing nothing nothing bad about that at all I read you that quote last Sunday where I don't care he said you can be 60 years old or live with a woman for 60 years be married for 60 years she's just as pure as from the day that you started and the male too so you see there's what that there's the the problem we have is is it rolls itself on out into lust and all the other things of the world and we get caught up in stuff like that and then storage is a love between family which is a parent to a child or a brother to a sister uh you know I can I can hug Anna and and we're okay that's my sister she's my blood sister but I don't hug her like I hug my wife see you got the the world's got it to where everybody hugs everybody and they you know June's mother she's a she's a hugger yeah yeah and she's about that short so you have to kind of watch her a little bit every once in a while cuz Daddy she'll run up to the hug Daddy and he'll turn you know give her that old hip hug you know cuz she's about right here on him you know but there's nothing meaning to that I mean there's no there's there's no kind of nothing sexual or sensual about that I promise you but all that though all kidding aside all that even in loving your child and all those things is a type of going back up to the love right amen okay it's a t it's for us Robbie is for us to be able to handle life that's what I want us to do today I want to be able to handle life and not have you know not have dumb thoughts about things and not have everything we going to read it in a few minutes to let your conversation be pure we're going to read a few minutes where brother R was talking about sisters going through the change of life how we're supposed to treat the sisters going through the change of life because it totally messes up her whole being well that's something us men don't have to worry about I mean they say that men go through the change but I we go through the chains every day Tyler's going I know that you're only 17 but ain't that right I mean we do we what need to go through the change you change you change a lot but go through it with them yeah go through the change with them don't ever separate yourself from your spouse right amen don't ever don't ever sisters don't you ever ever deny your husband the love that he needs amen sisters brothers same thing am do not deny your spouse the love that they need especially during during hard times cuz we're supposed to love it's easy to love them when everything's going fine right yeah but let a little financial problem come along or let something else come along and you will do what I said this morning about the world the world see the world that's what they that's what they come to love for remember it was sexual desire romantic feelings good looks Financial Security wanting to fit in fear of not getting married or wanting to escape from home yeah all right and that last one that happens to a lot of people especially people around the message they want to escape from home so they'll just find somebody that looks at them and marries them but now let's try to get to the ones that that's not happened to yet now all of us I was thinking about back there a few minutes ago and I'm going to go and bring it out a lot of us you know how many how many I know that Bob and Monica y'all married while you were in the message right y'all married in the Lord I know that for a fact but there a lot of us didn't right Danny GE we didn't I didn't I mean we didn't right so we got to we got to take take that though as that God winked at that he winked at that ignorance of ours but look what it come to consider the end of the conversation consider what happens at the end like I said about uh the brothers and sisters here that their wives or her husbands are not here don't make it be little yourself don't make it ashame but something happened in the past that you didn't pray about right that maybe it wasn't thought out all well but that doesn't mean it can't can't change that does not mean it can't change we pray for all of our spouses and and children and everything else right up to the day that anybody draws her last breath there's always hope amen all right sister Trudy come up to me and shook my hand she said I miss Tom well that's the attitude I want you to have right sitting here by herself she felt that closeness that she should have felt with her husband sitting there beside of her she was feeling that and she said I missed H right that's what she was feeling because what this m this word brings us so close to God and so close to love that we can love them even though they're not sitting beside of we can love them A Million Miles Away 2 million miles away don't matter how far around the earth they are this that's why I said that I read the quote and let's go to that one now number eight the one that we ended on last this morning Hebrews chapter 3 about the only religion and salvation we have in love is amongst the real godly people you know the Bible said that would happen congregation says amen uh-huh you Bible readers I heard you holler amen and you preachers back there that that's right the love would be so far away in the last days why it's tumbled down to that filio OS and all the other ones and it's just got all jumbled up right but even through a prophet God restored everything he tells us how to live and how to do and how to work and how to be how to be a Christian in the most horrible time that ever was on the face of the earth you take Peter and Paul and all them like that he said you bring them into this into this age they'd have problems right cuz they weren't made for this age they didn't have the problems we have they didn't have the daily daily activities that we have to deal with the love would be so far away in the last days the only love there would be left would be between the elect of God's people father would be against mother mother against father children against parents and different ones against each other and the only love would be left would be just for that be that elect just elected the word elect there comes from the word elected God's elected people right and then we started off we kind of talked a little bit about motive and objective I pulled up this just a few minutes ago just for the name for to see what motive is motive is something that causes the person to act in other words the motivation for you to come to church today was you were going to hear from God right so that was your motive and your objective is is you're heading toward something amen amen all right something toward which effort is directed you made an effort to get here all right an aim or a goal or an end of an action the end of my Christianity is going to be going in a Rapture on this earth right on this Earth struggles and Li when we come back there'll be no more struggles right we either pass away or we go up in a Rapture one of the two either way the toils of Life are over right right either way over but it's something that we put our effort and direct our aim and goal that's the same thing with having a excuse me having a a u spouse what is your motive and objective for having the person sitting beside of you what's your motive and objective for dating someone or courting someone or or you know what is that have we lost that I'll be honest the only motive and objective I have objective I had was that June and I were going to be together I couldn't see past any of that cuz I wasn't a Christian but now being a Christian I can see that that there's many things that she does in her life there's many things that I do in my life that tries I said tries tries to protect God and go to a goal toward one solid goal exactly and that's for us to get out of here it's not a goal for us to build this or build that or you know uh yeah it's for us to grow in a relationship yep but her goal as well as mine is to get to heaven right our goal is to get to heaven now now all the other things are superficial but they have to be there that's right raising a family raising the children dealing with problems that's not going to go away right we're not going to get in this bubble and say oh dear lord our motive and objective is to go to heaven so I'm going to sit down and yeah you're going to lose your home you'll lose your cars you'll lose your family no so there's other things there's there's there's there's things that happen around us but we we got to have the same goal and objective though right right see because because let's just use Juni for an example if she was a career-minded person and she wanted to be a banker and she wanted to be in this banking thing and she takes all these banking courses and she becom the bank president and she just that's what happens a lot of times she'll head off in this direction right and I ain't know where with we don't sit around and talk about these things or or think these things over or or do like brother CLA said about about the brother that came to him and I I personally knew the guy he was a preacher there in their Church who was going to take a job making a dollar an hour more but had to work on Sundays well that's only $40 a week Claude paid him $200 every two weeks to preach on Wednesday night yeah right can you add that up the guy was not only losing money he lost his faith cuz he is not even going to church anywhere anymore he just out in the world doing the things of the world because what his motive and objective did not come from his heart his motive and objective came from something he thought up in his head right same way with marriage why are some of you not with your spouses anymore you can name it cuz I you know I'm not hadn't been in that situation and I'm not saying I was no better cuz we've all had our uh what Paul said we've all had past in conversations of the flesh so I Ain't Got You know I'm not no better than anybody that's had 14 wives just probably a little more same than the one that had 14 but David had 500 and he was okay with it so but listen we all got to live as human beings even though how spiritual and how anointed we are right when you go home and you get up on Monday morning spirituality is way back here in the back somewhere now maybe for the retired people they can they can build up on that a little bit but but the rest of us that work the rest of us that work s g said the other day she was trying to find said dick told her to holler and come and get her you know if she needed anything said she hollered for about 15 minutes finally got up went got her own coffee and and finally found him who was sick who was a sicking in this group she's doing this I don't tell why that but that's life but life's going to come like that I it's comical but you know what it's something that we have to interact with but see the motive and motive and objective even you young people that are just married even us older people that are married our motive and objective should be one thing and that's to be the best Christians we can be right together in Christ okay together cuz you picked her she picked you whichever one and now you have a relationship but you have to come under that double Covenant sisters we're going to get to that Brothers we're going to get to that when we separate the two out that there are things that a woman can and cannot do brother Brown taught us that marriage and divorce things you can and cannot do all right but see if June go back to my point if June set her gold for something else and me set one this way yeah now a lot of you are taking that Dave Ramsey course and and and it's not just all about Finance June and I live a good life we live a good life God's been good to us and and you know we're within about $1,400 of paying off all of our debts so we're doing pretty well especially with losing you know the income that I lost but that's okay it didn't hurt us but what did it do it give us a motive and and an objective down on the earth something to shoot toward cuz you can make goals down here there's no need just say well I'm going to go to high school then I'm going to go get me a job no if you if you really want to go make yourself a goal go to college go to a trade school learn something do something don't just sit around and be nothing all right God's just been good to me he just G me good enough you know good jobs and I was telling ter the other day you know he he's retired there in in his 40s and I just I told him I said well you know what I said I made a good bit of money I said but I wasn't smart with my money I'll admit that I wasn't smart with it and God knew I probably wouldn't control it if I had a lot of it so he didn't never give me any well that's okay Paul didn't didn't God tell Paul said be content was where I got you at be content but if my goal would be to do something else and June's goal would be to do something then in this direction and we didn't talk about it that's why when we come back from that Dave Ramsey course and it didn't just teach us about finance that taught us about communication amen right and for those of you that are going through the class you can shake your head but you know what somewhere you two going to have to get together and you're going to have to make a budget right somewhere you going to have to get together and make a plan you going have to look eyeball to eyeball yeah that's what I told you those of you that don't are not taking it you have any other excuse you want to it's just that you don't like change yeah I don't mind change but you just don't like change boy Ain going to change brother boy I mean really don't it put you together it m Janet it makes you think and you say well that's just carnal got to start something somewhere yeah got to start somewhere at least trying to get on the same track with each other right trying to line something up cuz the Bible does tell you that the borrower is always slave to the lender Bible tells you that so let's try to you know and I know this is it's not a financial seminar but it does help to even if you don't have a lot of money at least you know where it's going at least you know what you're doing with it right and you know what and I have to sit down and we still sit down we don't do it on Fridays anymore cuz we don't get paid on Monday I don't get paid on Monday so we do it on Tuesday we sit down at the table count all of our bills out what we in need and what we owe you know what we have to come face to face when I look at June and I go U we ain't got enough money what did you do with it she's going to say I didn't spend it you did we see there's accountability same thing with God we got to be accountable to him right tells us to come to church he tells us not to do the things of the world he tells us not to not to have things in our house that we shouldn't have not to do this and that and the other and it's not do and those but what do we do back to them back to God we do those things that we do we do them back to God out of what love out of respect and that's what we're going to see with with the woman with the female toward the male when we get into the separation but we got to keep them together cuz we're still in the marriage part of it so motive and objective you know check up every once in a while June and I when we started that course about a year or so ago we started you know at X but we had to kind of redo our goal 6 or eight months down the line cuz things change see God don't change right God doesn't change so we know what that motive and objective should be so we always should have that motive and objective is to be one with God to go back to that Oneness of fellowship with god well under all that is what we're doing now Glory we're heading to that direction so June and I are heading in a direction to pay off all of our bills and be debt free and then our next objective would be is to give more how many ever would like to give more Amen to God and His and to his work but you don't have it to give right Glory why cuz we might we spend it foreverly that's right okay so we're head towards that direction so same way in the in the spiritual when I come to this I thought Lord you know just bring us to a bring us all to an agreement amen where we agree with God not an argument an agreement that we agree with what God is doing cuz we know the message people I was telling brother CL and I were talking the other day and he said this first he said your people don't have an excuse he said every mystery that's in the message he said has been preached correctly in your church so we we don't have an excuse doctrinally but we can ruin that by our conduct out there if that Doctrine doesn't become here it's just lip service it's just we go to Lula and we know all things that's right well the devil knows them too okay and I'll read to you in just a few minutes where brother Brown talks about a mystery all right let's go to number where we at Matthew 22 there you go thank you they were there before I was this is what we read this morning Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and this is the first and great commandment right we're going to talk about today spiritual three-dimensional love between Body Spirit and soul now let's pull up my little note here that we're going to read and this will be all on the internet but you can read this this is kind of compiled what we're going to look at but in marriage there must be the same kind of love and unity in Body Spirit and soul that is why God took woman out of man so they could truly be one in marriage man is commanded to love his wife as his own body and indeed they were one being in the beginning the only way that a husband can truly love his wife as his own body if they have that three-dimensional relationship Body Spirit and so all right once again what is important here is that unless the man and woman are truly one in Christ they can never have the kind of true love and fellowship that God intended they may have a unity in body and spirit but without a born again experience you can never have the unit have that unit in their soul right okay so now look let's go back to Ephesians 5 28-31 saw out men to love their wives as their own body he that loveth his wife loveth himself that's right for no man ever hated his own flesh but nourishes it and cherishes it even as the lord of the church for we are members of his body of his what flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh so it's not just all I kind of I made myself a little note here the world does not have love as we should have we should be the only people in the world that has true love and understands how it works and its effects you hear what I said we're the only people in the world that should have true love and understand how it works and it's effect when it does work right only those born of God have real love because all others are first and second dimensional when you say first and second dimensional what do you mean First Dimension is the flesh right our first Circle second circle is what the spirit third circle is the soul all right so now let's go to 1 John 4 verse 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of Goden and knoweth God right that's what takes true love true love to to what you're born again of God and not just to be born again God knoweth th that ongoing knoweth God get to know him and we know how that is and we can say that in the natural let's just be plain that that word no in the in the Testament there I know dick likes it and I do too cuz he said depart from me I never knew you right well God knows everything right God knows everybody but go back to Genesis where Adam knew his wife Eve right in other words they had a relationship all right and not just a relationship of talking to each other no they had an intimate relationship amen you can't become one unless you become intimate right all right so that's what he's saying here but let's apply this also to our lives as human beings but whoever loveth is born of God and knoweth God well hey you know what you know your spouse when you really truly know God Amen you know how your spouse works and you can really truly it won't be that magnet where both ends pops apart it'll be that part where that magnet where they'll stick together so close to where you can't pick them apart but now look May isn't this true worldly marriages are established only has one or two dimensional relationships in a onedimensional union their love may be only a physical attraction outside guy right lust or romance okay a two-dimensional Union includes their Spirit the second realm they now have friendship common interest blah blah blah common interest and they live together and you know and everything's that's what I'm telling you you can do that but they now have friendship common interest only a Christian marriage does all three dimensions come into view giving them a fulfilling relationship all right so you can have a first and second dimensional relationship but do we have the threedimensional relationship but now don't do away with one don't do away with two I'm talking natural don't do away with one don't do away with two cuz it's a part of you but add three right amen add three don't just be one and two one and two will cause divorce and all these other things right but three which brings God to be involved in it actually he should be number one but remember we putting him at the Third Realm I don't want to say God is number three in our life he shouldn't be should be number one right but he is in that Third Realm which is what what I say this morning Faith or doubt right fear or love right one of the two Faith which is love fear which is doubt right CU either love or doubt right brother said either either Faith or doubt love or fear you can say every way you want to in that inner part but in the second realm which is what memory reason see this is where you all get the central stuff memory reason conscious what you think about affection you love with your spirit and Imagination boy before the fall remember what happened but before U Noah what the Bible say the imagination of every man was continually what evil so you better be careful if you don't have that hidden man of the heart or that third one that Third Realm if you don't have it full of God you see what's going to happen and you see that has happened in previous lives of of those that have uh divorces and and separations and and stuff like that and I know I hate to talk about that but it's it's just a truth I mean it's just I'm trying to get to the young kids how many of you can turn around and look at the young kids and say don't do like I did don't please don't do like I did don't do like I did all right like brother rown said remember I told you you know a woman man all of us we can be forgiven for what we did but we can't be justified we can't have our virginity restored right all right but in God I believe if you come in Union with husband and wife and it's a true love and you have God in your life and the new birth and both of you have the new birth then that's what God saw God knew that would happen God knew that would come about if you have all three right right and not be just one and two if you have all three right a nurtured relationship with God then you then yes you can't but you know you can't be forgiven of what you did I mean you be forgiven but you can't be justified and say well I can do no you can't do what you want to do there's certain things that we there's you know it's like in hockey you you have a penalty box well sisters you got put in a penalty box you can't preach up here anymore yeah right because of what happened in the garden but you can be a pastor at home you can be a preacher to the little kids right so guess what the Bible says we'll be priests and Kings is that Revelations 5 when everything's restored back it didn't say Priestess right it said priest and Kings that's right so when June and I walk through Glory God's going to see one right he's not going to see two right he's going to see one she and I are one when he saw Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden he saw one they were so one he saw one person right okay exactly you and I better realize that with your spouse if if she's your true love we'll get we'll get into this just now in just a second all right the next thing we're going to look at then uh everybody on that um threedimensional you got Body Spirit Soul remember all you keep your memory Reon conscious affection imagination keep your U SE taste still smelling here cuz really i' like to preach on this sometime but your spirit is really that spirit is really where all that filtering comes in and out at right cuz honestly your body is just nothing right it don't have nothing exactly and but for the for the sake of us doing this here you have to say that first realm is what controls you that's where the L that's where it's displayed right but but but we may get into that one day and preach on that Spirit part Daddy I know he said he wanted to preach on the spirit but there's some things in there that that's that middle where you got you got a soul right here you got your flesh right here that thing's the filter on memory reason where we get our trouble at memory what we think of and remember reasoning don't do that in the word of God conscience affection and Imagination that's where the problems are CK spill smelling here is not a problem if that middle guy's right okay I want you everybody to understand that I kind of felt that maybe from the congregation that that somebody was saying what about the spirit that spirit I know that Spirit does that but your body still is there that's right yeah you still got this thing to deal with it's what you look through these eyes with that's right so the first thing is to see when you see something yes see taste feel smelling here here but that middle guy is the one that stands between all that amen and filters it out either way I mean if it's the devil it's the devil all the way through if it's God it's God and the devil still trying to get you right here and this thing is just displaying it right you know it's kind of like the battery in a in a um a little model car you take that little model car and you lay it up on the table and without a battery and a little bitty electrical motor in it that's right don't do nothing exactly right put you a little bitty motor in there yeah motor but it will if you put something in there yes you can't put the battery in there in the car you got to have the battery the motor in the car right all right put the battery in what where the spark comes from the inside guy and then that motor will display what that battery tells it to do well all the car is doing is running because of what's inside of it that's the same way with you and I that's why it takes three does take definitely three dimension of a marriage your body spirit and soul because you can't be you we can't sit here and go here's my body here's my spirit and here's my soul you can't do that take any one of them out in your deadly so they all got to be one that's right three in one this is your unit right here this is the unit but we got to live in this unit as human beings and that's what we're talking about this this time we're talking about human life okay we can talk about being you know being a spirit later on but still that's the motivator the one in here is motivating and then this guy is this is where the the fuel comes from he gets all that well we'll get into that later let's go to the next one love edifies 1 Corinthians 8:1 now as touching things under Idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but love does what edifies all right Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying and what does the word edifying mean build up build up the problem I see with you and me cuz I got ears to to hear I said you and me is that most of the time we're not building people up we're trying to tear them all down exactly right okay that may hurt everybody's feelings and it hurt mine too just then that's why I've told him a lot of times at work Mark will tell you I tell him look quit talking bad about people don't say stupid don't say them thing let's try to We're All Humans we got feelings and emotions and stuff you let them grow wild go wild you know what you going to have to deal with it sooner or later but now as Christians though as being Christians we should edify each othera right with no stipulation right love edifies right but that which is good let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister of what Grace unto the people that hear it right not just you but the people that hear it all right let's go to nine we're going to quote number nine hey let me read my quote my let me read my notes here first what we say in love or hatred matters it does y we should never be hurtful we should build up the other one always when a disagreement comes and and it will speak in private keep Family Matters in the family yeah right that's a good key right don't mean you talked about that office work anywhere you you need to go in private if you going to say if you're going to have a private conversation with somebody a disagreement you know what you need to do you need to take it behind closed doors right same way with your spouse don't let me hear you downstairs letting letting in and each other and everybody else listening to you right remember what remember what the old saying is family fights in the backyard amongst ourselves but don't you fight my family in the front yard yeah cuz you got to deal with me right me and my brother may fight in the backyard that's nobody's business but when you get out in the front yard and mess with my brother you going to have to mess with me that's the same way we ought to be with with our spouse listen let's get back down to just read this right here so they brought the fell down and I never felt so sorry for anyone in my life the poor kid standing there now I'm just as well off as anybody but he had just as much as I had but see I looked at him he had a jacket on it' been washed through the washer not very good at that and trousers about a dollar a pair and his little old wife standing there little blonde had hitchhiked all the way from Indianapolis 120 Mi to meet him to get married poor kid didn't have any shoes on her feet hardl I nearly it nearly broke I nearly broke my heart I thought my girl might be that way someday I want to buy the little thing a pair of shoes I was afraid I'd H her feelings she was real backwards she was standing here beautiful little old girl and I asked him if they loved each other they said sure So I said well now remember happiness does not consist of how much of the world's good you own but how contented you are with the portion that's lotted you yeah well now remember happiness does not consist of how much of the world's good you own but how contented you are with the portion that's lotted to you so that's what it be in other words he's saying that's their lotted portion so that's where they are he's going to deal with it on that level that's what he said right so I said that so that's what it be I said now there'll be times when you all won't see you won't see things alike now remember we're talking about edifying each other I'm talking about edifying our spouse and our family but always remember you're still in love when you see one set in one way and the other one in other words when she turns over on that side of the bed and you turn over on that side of the bed cuz you don't want to touch each other that night you've had an argument she was wrong and you were right yeah she was wrong and you were right yeah are you were wrong and she was right look what he said when you see one sit the other one don't I said give in if you're wrong it'll show after a while it'll be all right I said there's a little bowl in the human heart I love this that is full of golden oil called love if it's ever broke it can be healed up but there'll be a scar there as long as you live I said don't never have I said always give to each other and remember that's what your vows are amen pretty good quote huh that was in 1951 1951 60 years ago all right let's go to B excuse me Christ The Mystery of God revealed listen to this that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up cuz it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life you read that right that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here it will kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do any it'll do everything see don't you do it you just wax that much closer together draw up the take the Buckle as a brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision that buckled on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and what then God will bless you pretty good huh number 10 desperations 1963 I'm not going to call these out cuz you can see them on the board how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's in filio now how about AG go for love to God how can it be if you don't love God if you said said you loved your wife and N tell her about it hello sisters yeah amen have you told your wife you loved her today amen if you said you loved your wife and never tell her about it and never set down and make love to her oh Prophet talks about making love expressed it to her kiss her hug her tell her she's the best cook in the country Danny all right let's go finish all the things that she do know in other words and how pretty she is I thought about that when I got that quote and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it edifying we're talking about edifying that's the last thing we're going to talk about edifying building up that's the way we do to God when we love him we tell him about it amen we sat down and we adore him and worship him and see love drives us to that love drives drives us to that and I want you to this is the next one let's go to what's the next one guys I don't yeah now let me give you a background on this in God in Simplicity brother brand when he was preaching remember the Tabernacle had been set up brother Bron preached God in Simplicity and then the breach and then the seals right well when God in Simplicity when he walks out he says I'm a little late because I married a couple in the back office well that brother that wrote that book about courtship and marriage he found this guy that he married and his name is brother Jim and now brother Jim's testimony this is what he said brother brandham said to him during that ceremony brother Bown told my wife and I never to argue he said it takes two people to argue he said because every time you argue you wound the heart remember the quote right we talking about breaking the oil the heart o breaking it you know you can mend it but it'll always be a scar every time you argue you wound the heart and everybody says it's exactly right it might heal but there'll always be a scar there and and I'm paraphrasing this cuz there was a little a long paragraph but the last thing he said he told them before they left the door he said or left out the door he said never argue with one another amen and you can see there's one quote I don't have it but now was it was in 1963 he said that Ma he and MAA had never had an argument never had an argument 1963 never had an argument now let's go to number 10 or 11 I'm sorry 11 you're right questions and answers 1964 the Bible said let not let one dirty conversation come among you when you profess Holiness now remember what we're talking about edifying we're talking about how we're going to act toward our spouse yeah the Bible said not let one dirty conversation come among you when you profess Holiness treat that little lady like she's your little sweetheart if she's 60 years old you be just the same you be that Gallant boyfriend remember you are you don't try none of those new things and I know what I'm talking you just be a husband a genuine brother a genuine Christian I know that sounds but the you're my kids I got a right to say it when I want to to you you see you're my kids you live right you women live the right way to your husband you husband live the right way to to to your wives be real real nice and respect one another just uh and your family relations and so forth like that let it be just as reverently and godly and agreed with among you and everything as it can be don't never push and shove and be dirty and vulgar he's talking about us living together as husband and wife all right keep reading look at this one understand talk to your her life if one nature is to you and another nature to her talk it with her you try to do the same thing to him sister in the same way understand one another and be real Christian gentlemen and real Christian ladies and be brothers and sisters with one another always remember you're God's children and you're from a royal family amen you're a royal blood there's no better blood in the world than yours and that's right and a royal blood shows itself that's what it is it's Royal all believe that say Amen yes sir show what you are I'm I'm a son of a king I'm a son of the king my wife is the daughter of a king how would I treat that King's Daughter how would she treat that King's son see what I mean be real genuine amen real what genuine edifying right understand your wife wife understand your husband let's start doing that around here let's start building our wives up and our husband let's be real men and real women let's let's not act I don't like that acting Bunch right you know you know it's like the it's like the guy said you know the I said about the the girl that the the brother went out thought he would you know pretended to be drunk goes in and knocks the plate off you know and him and his buddy goes around looks through the window and she's down there saying should Jesus bear the cross alone most of you women would be in down there going when gets home I'll kill him you know her whole attitude was that she was doing the best she could do with what she had right and she started singing a pong I told you for those of you that weren't here last Sunday I told them I said if there ever an argument starts just say let's pray that'll kill it let's pray and then just ask God and you still may have the argument but pray and say God help us we're humans we got a situation here that we don't know how to handle she's looking this way I'm looking that way just like my brother Brown said if she's this way and your Nature's this way on a situation come together because once you come to ain't it much better to come to a mutual agreement that you both are working toward the same thing instead of one saying well I'll just you know women say well I'll just submit to the husband but but but then get on the phone and say hey S I really don't want to do this you know this nothing nothing I want to do but I'm going to do it just cuz he's the head no no you're wrong to start with right right that's the wrong attitude to have you should talk that thing out and there should be nothing now listen to me there should be nothing going on outside of your marriage as far as your married life it's nobody else's business right it said leave your father and mother right and cleave to your spouse when Jeffrey and Amy is not here but I talked to them before we uh did the ceremony and I told him I said you love each other don't worry about nothing El because you're bringing two families together that don't know each other not in that way but when you come together you need to both of you let it be not let it not be arguments between your family remember husband and wife you make your own way right if we make our bed hard we going to lay in it but you know what look at that last quote be real genuine amen don't be fake don't be put on you ought to be able like like you know brother D said and brother brand said many times go talk to the people that work around you CU all of you brain this is going to be good can I I challenge any of you to bring two or three of your employees that work close to you bring them up here in this pull pit and have them testify how you act yeah when you're not in church yeah I see some of you let me be a little more plain let's bring your spouse up here yeah and say how do he act how does he act how does she act or react I told you we was going to get right down to where we live but you know what that's where it all starts let's finish this and we'll be done let's go to Genesis 268 now we're going to talk about real friendship and romance this will be the last two things we're going to talk about we talked about Fellowship we talked about edifying uh getting the family I mean getting the husband and wife together and talking about things but let's get this last part it's real friendship I'm talking about real friendship not just friendship that you have with a buddy of yours I'm talking about real friendship look what happened in Genesis 268 and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that AIX King of the Philistines looked out a window and saw and behold Isaac was sporting with Rebecca and his wife and if you read the whole thing Isaac didn't like it like his daddy he went to Egypt and told Pharaoh that that was his sister right just like Abraham and Sarah did but aik looked out the window and saw Isaac sporting with Rebecca his wife yeah if you keep on reading the whole story is he came to realize one thing they weren't just friends cuz with the way they were sporting with each other friends don't sport like that supposed to supposed to the reason I brought that out is is because that's what you and I I know there's times when you shouldn't do things but you know let people know that's your wife don't be ashamed of her let people know that's your husband if you're ashamed of each other and your ways you need to get back together go back to that little meeting and have that little meeting and get to understand each other a little bit better but Isaac and Rebecca the way they acted show the third person that they were married yeah all right now go to Ecclesiastes 9 and N live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life in other words of your vanity which is your time span which he hath given thee unto the son all the days of thy vanity for this is thy portion in this life and in thy labor which thou takest Under the Sun live joyfully with the the wife you get that out live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of in other words your whole your whole life up until the time that you pass away or we get out of here in the Rapture all right let's go to number 12 we got we're going to read 12 13 the law having the shadow look here if Eve was that sort I want you to look at this I want you to this is a powerful quote look at here if Eve was that sort of a looking brute every man in the world would admire a woman that looked dirty and ungod like that but there's not a man I don't care who he is but what admires a woman that keeps her place and is clean and acts nice if he's got any streak of man about at all he does right so it shows the very strain hold on now this is a strain coming all the way from Adam and Eve so it shows the very strain that Eve was the most beautiful thing that ever what that on the earth that's right she didn't need any Max Factor to fix herself up she had it from God that beautiful teeth would never turn yellow or fall out and that I see her sitting there and her hair hanging down there her back and her eyes was bright as the stars of Heaven listen to this when Adam looked at her it put such a shock that still lives in mankind amen right from the very beginning a beautiful woman now that now look take the quote back up here clean AC nice he's talking about this talking about he ain't talking about really Eve he's talking about your wife I see her sitting there look when Adam looked at her it put such a shot that still lives in mankind that's right I believe it there she was a beautiful species and he picked her up in his arms he looked at her and said why she's Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone and sweethearts when almighty God squared them off there and performed the marriage ceremony and took her by the arm and down through Eden he went perfect God's children right next one time tested memorials and was talking about men losing their affections for their wives and don't love them as they did when they were sweetheart shame on you you ought to do that you ought to do it she's always your sweetheart absolutely that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that little honeymoon cease cuz it listen oh never let that little honeymoon cease cuz it isn't going to in heaven right it's going to be just perfectly one there that's right it's all looks like some woman ought to say Amen to that don't it you never let me hear you always balling women out and talking like sister Hickerson why didn't you say something or somebody back there say did you thank you sister Cox that's very good brother Cox that's for you every where you are now every where you are now he was probably under the under the bench all right yes sir and we should never forget to honor each other always be sweethearts never let it cease all right number 14 remember this we're talking about being being romantic and being a real friend right up to right up to the time that we go out of this Earth or going a Rapture statue of a perfect man I said well if you're not going to live without her you better marry her then but if you can live without her you better not but if it's going to kill you you better you better go ahead and get married I said and so what was I trying to get to him this that if you love her so much now right now before you're married everything is just fine and dandy but after you get married then the TOs and trials of Life come in that's when you've got to be so in love that you understand one another you see what you see what um message that come out of don't you yeah virtues right that's you a perfect man he's talking about getting married now right here before you're married everything is just fine and dandy but after you get married then the toils and trials of Life come in that's when you got to be so in love that you understand one another Now understand means that you can't do some of the things that you used to do our bodies change things change when you're disappointed in her she's disappointed in you you still understand one another all right go to the next one number 15 questions and answers 1964 and you husbands to your wives when they're in that time of life if you ever if she ever was your sweetheart you let her be right then cuz she needs you she really needs your help she needs somebody to help her and understand her talk to her take her up in your arms like she was your sweetheart and she should be and understand her because she's going through a time that her entire makeup is changing and you must be good to her at that time talking about going to the change of life now 1 Peter 3 this is where we're going to begin with next Sunday talking about Abraham and Sarah but we're going to do the men first so you can all go fishing brother Tracy is going to take everybody fishing next s Sunday morning you know what he told me he said you know it doesn't bother me to preach on the men he said he preaching on the women and I thought what is he talking about I thought oh yeah when they go home they go do I do that is that me was he talking about me did I do that the man's like oh yeah we do that we say oh yeah we do that but the women's like oh you was talking about me was he so you got to deal with all that you husbands when you get home praise the Lord first Peter 3 and 6 this is part of our scripture that we read when we started we're doing okay even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling them Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazing right likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor to the wife as to the weaker vessel and as being HS together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered now let's go to the very last quote thinking man filter 1965 oh for the grace of God that he would give us listen to this w't you all pay attention oh for the grace of God that he would give us understanding of such great Mysteries as Paul spoke here further on down in Ephesians speaking of the husband and wife and said this is the mystery how the woman should be in respect to their husband even the second place I believe it is the entire Bible that reverence was ever spoken to said the woman seeing she reverence her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought listen it ain't just a woman reverencing the husband he live a hound dog life amen no sir cuz when we're going to talk about the role of the man and woman and the and the man is you're still back together but we're taking on a separate aspect to show the woman being a weaker vessel and the male supposed to be the head of the house then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a Son of God and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is a that is reverent man reverent and clean with his wife and before his family family a real servant of God then the women children and all should respect that servant of God with reverence amen woman love your husbands give him respect we were talking about you know Sarah well I've got a few more quotes in here we we'll read next Sunday about Sarah obeying Abraham why did she do that calling him Lord cuz he acted like one that's hard to understand when you he give her tried to give her away twice and she didn't say nothing about it right she didn't go running up like a lot of you would bless God Pharaoh I'm his wife he's wrong no she trusted Abraham that's the only thing I can say is that she trusted Abraham she actually trusted God but she trusted Abraham in what he was doing if not why wouldn't you as a human being if you husband was getting ready to give you away would speak up yeah she was submissive to her husband but Abraham acted the part she wouldn't have called him Lord and it would have been put in the Eternal Word of God if she called him Lord and didn't mean it amen all right and mean it so I me you know we don't have to go around doing that but we are supposed to have a Godly reverence and and a fear you know what the fear is the fear is not that God's going to kill us it's that we're that we might do something that would affect amen right that's my fear I think I got it settled with God but my fear is that that I'll Stand in your way y that I'll be a stumbling block to you guys that's what my fear is right cuz Satan can get in and do that that's why I always pray I say God when you come up for prayer whatever you get prayed for is none of my business unless you're telling me up here none of my business but when I'm praying I'm saying Lord don't let me stand in the way of them getting healed and man things will start rolling in my head that the day that happened that I should have done this and I should have done that and I shouldn't have said this and I shouldn't have said that and I just say God clear that slate out I'm sorry I apologize see I'm up there asking for repentance for myself actually but see brother bam said that your unconfessed sin in the way you act right you act the way you act can hinder somebody getting healed I don't want to come up to the day where we're going to have a give an account not in the day of judgment but the day we're going have to give an account and they tell me that because Gary Atkins has got a a disease that he's got that it was my fault that he didn't get healed cuz you're going to know it in that day in that day God's going to say You Hinder the service that this person right here should have got healed he's going to tell us that cuz that's the deeds in the body that we're going to have to give an account for God's going to tell us our actions what we did hindered or helped I like what brother CLA said he was right when when anybody gets behind this pull pit and they preach you the true word of God there's a reward for that it might just be one person right that's right but there's a reward for that right just like that sister came up to him and said brother clar I've been coming to this church for 40 years but what you said tonight changed me amen that was a revelation of of a mystery right that just come to one little person and that lady's about 70 how old sister J about 75 76 years old hope she's not listening you'll kill me when I get out there but she's pretty she's pretty she's 75 or 76 so she's been going through life a long time what I'm the point I'm trying to make she's been going through life a long time and there was a mysterious part in her life that she couldn't understand right and somebody brought something over the pull pit that she said that changed me or unlocked something that I never knew that changed the very person that I am that's what I want I don't want to I don't want to be a hindrance I want to be a help to somebody I want to be able to somebody to just you know you never have to you don't have to come and tell me and Pat me on the back but like brother Bram said we're all human we still like a little pat on the back yeah right remember that guy was criticizing brother brandham and he said re difference in me and you are said you're Li you're lying and I'm not but let's love everyone as husband and wife amen and then love each other as a church family right but I hope this part of just in marriage and we're going to split it up next Sunday we're going to do the the role of the male and the role of the female and I'm going to keep it secret I may start with a role of the female just to make y'all just to give you'all something to talk about between services and then the men can run out in the evening but no as a as a married couple we should remember one thing as we act down here as Christians should be the same way that Christ acts toward us as a church and as a as a bride of Jesus Christ we're supposed to not argue with him well brother Brandon said don't argue that's right don't argue takes two to argue we're supposed to be submissive as our we're wanting our wife to be submissive to us we we don't want to be submissive to Christ right no we got to be just as submissive to Christ as our wife is to be submissive to the husband right let's stand and and we'll get ready to take communion let's just sing one song Let's sing I love him just in case anybody wants prayer if not we'll let brother Dale come and start on the on the uh love you I love him he before we were lovable God loved us one more time to ah I love him do you love him I love him thank you Lord first love me and my Sal all now if you need healing let's think it like this raise your hand if you need healing he heals me you believe it now he heals me he took every stri for you his I he come completely now I free amen you love the Lord let's go right into the communion sweet Spirit here now let's just go right on into the communion brother day turn me off Tyler please amen amen enjoy the message that's what it is in Christ amen we're one together in Soul we're going to come together as husband and wife that's right right to be in the right channel right if we're one together and so if we're not then it won't work amen that's right we just tell wait how much you appreciate the the message be much in prayor the Lord will bless him as he keeps breaking down the things into to us and all and remember the ones that will be coming brother Andre will be with us here Wednesday preaching right and then remember the fellowship meeting brother uh jald Hughes will be here with us for the weekend so remember that just be much in prayer amen so if You' like turn in your scripture we'll go right into the communion 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus in the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eat of and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this me cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged that's this is what I like when we are judged we're chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world that's right wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come Discerning the Lord's body you know and that's who we are right what W's talking about right husband wife Church everything Pastor Church Fellowship together we're just one family somebody down ago was talking about U was looking at some pictures and and they said well that was just their family and the other one said yeah that's right it's just our whole family well there was all kind of people in that picture cuz that's what we are as a family in the Lord right amen so let's just take a few moments in silent prayer that the scripture says and then we'll go right on into to the to the communion and all and just pray one for another you pray for me I pray for you that's the main thing because that way God will honor it right father we thank you for an opportunity to being here today we ask that you would truly do unto each and every one of us to bring us to a place that we would honor one another and reverence one another husband wife church people Lord and bless each one those that will be listening or are listening now by internet and things that they are part of the body of Christ around the world and that's what we all are we're just your body we have nothing here to join Lord we have nothing in that order we just have you and we pray that you would just bless each one now forgive our sins lead us as we go into the furtherment of the service in Jesus name amen Terren welcome the brother that's here but we still say to him you know uh glad to have you we always say when you come here one time you're a visitor two times you're part of us so we just pray the Lord would bless you and and help you and guide in each way amen father we thank you for this bread it was made for this purpose here today that we may all partake together and Lord it represents your body which was broken for each one of us and it's not around way for us not just something to to throw aside or whatever to do or it's in representation of you in your word we pray that you would just sanctify the bread and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you in Jesus name it's not a not a something where you can just order it now right you can go online and you can just order a little thing that's got a little wafer laying on top it's got a little cup communion right you just get it order it keep it you know of course don't keep it too long because yeah it is grape juice yeah it is not wine because they don't most of the people don't do it that way but right we don't believe it that way we'd like to the bread supposed to be made today and it's supposed to be burned tonight before the night's over and finishing up you know it's supposed to be burned because we're not trying to hold over to another day amen we're trying to believe in the word for the hour and like the Bible says give us this day our daily bread you know that's what we're Desiring in the Lorden to me this is a a a great thing because tend to understand like I said we used to order it was in the Baptist Church we we'd order it and and get it they'd send it to us in a little bag and we we most of the time the deacons taken care of it would like a yearly thing that we would do you know and and as we would do that whatever bread we had left we just take it back and just you know put it in the freezer freeze it over 3 months later or whenever we took the communion we'd go back and we' get that bread out and thought it out we we do it but I'm not throwing no light at nobody right it's not that it's the main thing is understanding what it is because this is not the body it's just in representation that's it just represents the body of CH it's not not the literal body see and that way then we're we're holding it in the correct order amen father we thank you for this wine that's went through the process of aging and gets better every day Lord we know that it's a type of thy blood which was shed for each and every one of us the spirit of the Living God here to be able to Quicken to us that that we need we eat the bread we drink the the little wine and it stimulates and makes blood cells in our body we thank you for that because life only comes through you we ask you to just bless the wine and bless the partakers that we may all be together as one in you in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river our the everen tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight morning there for me sometimes I'm desp and rejected and I question oh Father how then I take one more look at M calary and it gives me the I some morning between 600 and 9:00 tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning is glor amen amen we've even seen people healed by taking the communion that's right it is a spiritual amen application it's a physical thing that's right if we get our mind off the physical and get our mind on thinking the spiritual and what is what it represents yes then there's healing amen AB in that there's Deliverance there's all kind of things in there for us through all of what you can think because it's your mind getting your mind in the right Channel and your thoughts that were you know the the communion then it took Paul as I've always said what about all of the disciples that walked even with the Lord Jesus and and witnessed and and re received the the communion and things on a they done it you know at least yearly on a a thing for the Passover so you know in that points but they were not chosen that's right to write about it and Paul that was one born out a due season that's right but he could take that Old Testament and he could look at them things and he brought out of that Old Testament as way was short one time he literally brought right out of there that they had those things that would take place that that would represent what we're doing right here and taking the community so it's all into the word it's not something outside of the word I'm so glad of that that's you know that our our Prophet brought us the message to where we can see and know the truth that's right okay go ahead go we're running one down today two three down right praise the Lord that absolutely what he's going to do I'll just say one word you know now listen please if anybody on the internet here this don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say I was thinking while Wade was preaching there and he said brother random said it and I believe him he said it him and his wife never had an AR well I believe that okay but do you think that they never had a difference of an agreement right no I don't think so no a lot of dark a lot of difference between an argument and a difference of an agreement you know I mean you know the wife says I I want to do it this way the husband says I want to do it this way that's a difference in agreement right but it can develop into an argument right but now he said it he said he never had an argument all right but what about when did she told him said okay you know slammed the door walked out and left him you know that's right and God placed a C on you know for doing those things so then when the prophet will say things I know they won't like the word but you got to analyze what he's saying that's right you got to be sensible right amen hallelujah that's right if he said that they never had if you say well now did y'all ever have a short word sure they'd say yeah did you ever have a time you didn't agree with each other he said I'm always telling her I love her and said she don't believe right that's qu that's right but see then to think about it that for a husband and wife to have a discussion about something right you know what they want to do here or to do there or what out to do thing is that an argument you now it can develop into an argument yes that's it but when it's a difference in opinion it's not a an argumented thing it's it's different right let's Aller take together you be seated you for a moment while get ready you know it's something to say that when we first started here they we would have only needed that's right a third of a third of one of those trays to Y be able to serve communion but now you know I would I would it get where we had to car out the wall we talked about it build on everything because we want to serve God that's right amen we're not going to do it till we have to so we're not going to worry about it so we ain't going to B buy extra communion Cuts already got them we've had them for years knowing you'd come one eventually right CU we ordered them and I've told well while told different people at different times even who would come back to the church right in the end time because I believed it amen and I've seen it take place all right and that way then you know we just wait brother said I don't know how many to be saved in that last moment to Rapture the church that's right now something in it amen I would to God this church would be so full until we'd have to bust out and cover the whole city of Lula as far as to preach the gospel to CU that's what we we're looking forward toen get the gospel out right right let the world hear not trying to be a pastor of the world on the internet no those people are told you don't ask me your questions they've even wrote the questions don't ask me your question sent back to them you ask your pastor or you ask the prophet's message right you know you know because it's we're not trying to do that we're trying to serve God am and just be what we can be that's right in the body of Christ and then help everybody we can amen amen isn't that the way we're supposed to be let's stand together when read the scriptures and then going into the foot washing John 13:2 and suffer being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his car Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rised from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and gted himself after that he poured water into a Bas be to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is wash needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and you are clean but not all now if you notice he didn't stay by his hands and his head Peter was saying you know not only feet being wash and do my hands in my head to do dirty parts of him God didn't mention that he just let that go but he talked about you know he don't need to wash his feet but he needs to be clean every we right but they were all clean see cuz Judas was still dark for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and then taken his garments and was set down again he sath unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's just pray and the sisters can go down the stairs for the for the foot washing father we thank you for today we thank you for what we've heard we pray that what it'll do is to it'll come down into our hearts and our lives and come back out of us and make us better Christians make us better husbands and wives and children and all Lord and fathers and mothers make us into the place that we need to be especially to make me into a better Pastor for you Lord that we all may be one together in you as our desire bless us now be with the people as we go through the foot washing and then take care of for everybody on the way home give a safe journey we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen good his
