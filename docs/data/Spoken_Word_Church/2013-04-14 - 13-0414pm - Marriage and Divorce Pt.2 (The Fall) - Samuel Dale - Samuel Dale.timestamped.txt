[7:33] amen and amen and amen i want to see him
[7:36] don't you
[7:37] good to see everybody in the house of
[7:38] the lord if you'd like to turn in
[7:39] matthew 19 again we'll be reading this
[7:42] scripture probably for a while
[7:45] to be speaking on
[7:47] the series on marriage and divorce
[7:50] and like i say i don't have any bones to
[7:52] pick with anybody
[7:54] i don't have
[7:55] don't want to think of have a private
[7:57] doctrine
[7:58] about marriage and divorce i may
[8:01] think of things in one way and you and
[8:03] another uh is doing it but i hope they
[8:06] don't
[8:07] pull apart i hope they all come together
[8:10] to make a beautiful picture
[8:12] to where we can study the word of the
[8:14] lord and and do and i've always been one
[8:17] person to be one thing
[8:20] if i'm wrong
[8:22] now if i'm not wrong you tell me i'm
[8:24] wrong i don't like that
[8:26] you don't either okay
[8:28] but if i'm wrong and you tell me i'm
[8:30] wrong i don't have any problems
[8:32] because i know i'm wrong
[8:34] so anybody would have any marital
[8:36] problems and things
[8:38] it's not the bible and the prophet or me
[8:41] or anybody trying to
[8:43] condemn you it's
[8:45] it's all trying to be straight
[8:48] now
[8:49] it's like i've said it i believe it
[8:52] i believe that if we don't have the
[8:54] correct understanding of marriage and
[8:56] divorce
[8:58] and get all things straight in our lives
[9:01] uh you you're going to differ with me
[9:03] i'm sure but
[9:05] i i believe we're going to go by the
[9:07] grave that's right
[9:09] i believe the ones who stand in the
[9:11] moment of twinkling of an eye to be
[9:12] changed are going to have everything
[9:14] straight
[9:15] and right you know and doing right now i
[9:18] didn't say you wouldn't go in the
[9:19] rapture that's don't accuse me of stuff
[9:22] just take what i say
[9:24] if i have a problem and i won't get it
[9:26] corrected then i may have to go by the
[9:28] grave
[9:29] well because i believe that the ones
[9:31] that will be changed i'm going to
[9:32] trinkle and i will be a world-born bride
[9:34] walking and everything would have also
[9:36] preached to you it's not going to be a
[9:37] perfect zombie looking thing we're going
[9:40] to be human the prophet said stickers
[9:42] until we're changed
[9:44] all right but we need to get everything
[9:47] right
[9:48] while we're here right now because it's
[9:50] not you're going somewhere else and try
[9:52] to pull a court of appeal
[9:54] and you know and get something right
[9:55] it's either made right here or we're
[9:56] going to answer for it
[9:58] so i'd rather have it somebody to tell
[10:00] me the truth here
[10:02] you know and let me make my own mind of
[10:04] what to do and everything then to leave
[10:07] me and not tell me
[10:10] because if i don't tell you the blood's
[10:11] on me
[10:13] you know so that's
[10:14] you know that's just the basis of it
[10:16] okay matthew 19 remember
[10:18] now the fellowship meeting will be here
[10:20] on the third saturday
[10:22] and remember the cash family there and
[10:25] the loss of the of his father and just
[10:28] pray that the lord would bless all of
[10:29] them
[10:30] and remember the sick among us but
[10:32] remember the bible said he sent his word
[10:34] and healed us
[10:35] so i believe it he said his word to heal
[10:37] us i believe that don't you
[10:39] matthew 19. father we thank you for your
[10:41] love and your understanding thank you
[10:44] for the day that we can truly stand and
[10:46] say
[10:47] the correct answer for all things has
[10:49] been given into our hands
[10:51] we may not know all the answers that's
[10:54] no problem father but we know a god that
[10:57] has all the answers
[10:59] and then he can give and give them unto
[11:00] us in our
[11:02] our needful times maybe sometimes we
[11:04] don't need
[11:05] answers
[11:07] maybe our questions is what holds us in
[11:09] line to keep us
[11:11] to waiting is our time to be for you to
[11:13] answer us
[11:15] but we just ask you to have your way now
[11:16] bless the cast family there lord and be
[11:19] with each and every one we love you and
[11:21] we thank you father let your grace be
[11:23] sufficient in jesus name amen
[11:27] matthew
[11:29] 19 we'll begin verse 3.
[11:34] and the pharisees also came unto him
[11:36] tempting him
[11:37] remember this morning not tempting him
[11:40] wouldn't care about what he said he
[11:42] would just tend to try to
[11:44] try to catch him some way
[11:46] or to show how smart they were you know
[11:50] tempting him and saying
[11:52] unto him is it lawful for a man to put
[11:54] away his wife forever cause
[11:56] no huh
[11:58] moses never never said it that way
[12:00] uh
[12:02] because if you don't believe it now
[12:04] i wrote this in my bible where it says
[12:06] there where it says can you put away a
[12:08] man forever calls
[12:12] read verse 9 sometimes
[12:14] where it says and i say unto you
[12:15] whosoever shall put away his wife except
[12:18] it be for fornication
[12:20] so jesus wasn't telling them it's all
[12:22] right for everything
[12:24] he put it in order like we've talked
[12:25] about this morning
[12:27] all right and the answer and said unto
[12:28] them have you not read
[12:30] that he that made them at the beginning
[12:32] made them male and female
[12:34] and said for this cause shall a man
[12:36] leave his father and mother and shall
[12:37] cleave to his wife and they
[12:39] twain shall be one flesh
[12:41] wherefore there are no more twain but
[12:44] one flesh
[12:45] what therefore god hath joined together
[12:47] let no man
[12:49] let not man put asunder they say unto
[12:51] him
[12:52] why did moses then command to give a
[12:54] writing of divorcement
[12:56] and to put her away
[12:57] he saith unto them moses because of the
[13:00] hardness of your hearts suffered you to
[13:02] put away your wives but from the
[13:04] beginning
[13:05] it was not so amen you may be seated the
[13:08] lord had his blessing to the
[13:10] reading of the word now
[13:13] we put a lot of information this morning
[13:15] i've already got
[13:17] a bunch of questions and i'll try to
[13:19] answer along the way
[13:21] but my whole sum of it until
[13:24] uh do we finish up into the series or
[13:26] something
[13:27] but and i enjoy questions because that
[13:29] means you're thinking right
[13:31] you know
[13:32] and and i hope you was following me this
[13:34] morning
[13:36] in the lineup
[13:37] and if i don't even get into the notes
[13:39] for this afternoon's message
[13:41] i want to make sure you follow me
[13:44] not to say i've never asked anybody to
[13:47] believe me
[13:49] all right i don't ask my wife to believe
[13:51] me i don't ask my kids grandkids and all
[13:55] the daughter-in-law son-in-laws i don't
[13:57] ask them to believe me
[13:59] i ask them to listen sit down think it
[14:03] over
[14:04] and let god speak to them
[14:07] because they take it on the basis well
[14:09] daddy said it or papa said it or
[14:11] something
[14:12] then you just build on a man
[14:14] and see i'm afraid that's what has
[14:16] happened basically
[14:18] with the people of the message that they
[14:19] just say
[14:20] brother branham said it
[14:23] right
[14:24] and that's wonderful
[14:26] but he also said in marriage and divorce
[14:29] he said if this is not revealed to you
[14:34] right
[14:35] amen marriage and divorce has to be
[14:37] revealed
[14:38] not just read it
[14:40] quote it but it'll be revealed he said
[14:42] it was a and it said because of a
[14:44] supernatural revelation because of the
[14:47] opening of the seven seals i say unto
[14:49] you
[14:50] all right now if the seals had not never
[14:52] broken unto him
[14:53] then he could have never told us those
[14:55] things but they were broke and brought
[14:57] forth the open word
[14:58] that would show him the truth
[15:01] all right so then we need to
[15:03] seek god for revelation well brother
[15:06] dale i i i'm pure wonderful
[15:10] wonderful that's great
[15:12] wonderful person could be able to stand
[15:14] there but just make sure you don't have
[15:16] any closets
[15:18] is that our terminologies for things
[15:20] that we
[15:22] have shelved away somewhere that we
[15:24] maybe think they're not too important
[15:28] but they may be as we go along
[15:30] because you know you sisters you could
[15:32] say well i was a virgin when i married
[15:34] well praise the lord
[15:38] can you quote with the prophet though he
[15:40] said
[15:41] a kiss is a potential adultery
[15:44] i mean can you quote that away see
[15:47] all right see that's that's a long gap
[15:50] and remember now brother dale's not the
[15:52] kind it just preaches against women
[15:55] okay
[15:57] like i said this morning they want to
[15:58] make women to be a a piece of hamburger
[16:01] meat
[16:02] you know
[16:03] but the man he's a t-bone steak man he's
[16:07] he's yeah
[16:10] my mother used to make a statement she
[16:12] said
[16:13] did a man go out and live and do all he
[16:15] wants to and go put on a suit of clothes
[16:16] go to church he's called a brother
[16:19] he said let a woman do one mistake since
[16:21] she's an adulteress rest of her life
[16:24] well that's true
[16:27] but see i don't preach this those things
[16:29] against women
[16:30] remember you men are the cause too
[16:34] the woman can't do very much by herself
[16:37] that's plain language but it's true
[16:40] you know
[16:41] all right that's right and see then
[16:43] that's you know they had to be a beast
[16:46] and we'll get to you know
[16:48] it wasn't something he had in her own
[16:50] so just remember we're not picking on
[16:52] women we're trying to find the truth
[16:55] because remember in the body of christ
[16:59] we are feminish
[17:02] come on amen
[17:04] and if you'll read marriage and divorce
[17:05] you'll find brother brown especially
[17:07] that in invisible union puts a lot of
[17:10] emphasis upon the spiritual side
[17:12] of spiritual adultery
[17:15] and how that we've got to confess
[17:16] everything before we can be married to
[17:18] christ the word
[17:21] see he's just not picking on just the
[17:23] women you know that's that's the point
[17:25] but now
[17:26] back up into what we were talking about
[17:28] this morning
[17:30] that said they said you know
[17:34] a man could just put away his wife for
[17:36] any cause
[17:38] well then why would in the same
[17:40] point i didn't read it this morning but
[17:42] you know i was quoting it there a minute
[17:43] ago verse nine which is right on over
[17:46] from this verse
[17:47] three
[17:49] and i say unto you so put away his wife
[17:51] except
[17:52] it be for confornique in other words for
[17:54] any other reason to fornication
[17:57] he commenced adultery
[18:01] that's adultery is the act all right
[18:04] now
[18:06] then that way it's not for just anything
[18:10] but yet they took it right
[18:13] and made it to be for anything see
[18:17] that they wanted
[18:19] all right now you see that among the
[18:21] people of the message
[18:24] you know
[18:25] you see a man maybe have one i have in
[18:27] mind had about 10 kids with his first
[18:29] wife and
[18:30] you know finally one day he decided to
[18:32] put her away and get him another one
[18:35] because she
[18:37] she would have done something wrong
[18:38] before they married but
[18:39] we found out probably she told him about
[18:42] it well now she told him about it
[18:44] and he forgave her how can he use it
[18:46] against her
[18:48] nose see
[18:50] i'm sorry
[18:51] see people are saying well i've got a
[18:53] right i'm right i know you can't tell me
[18:57] heard a man one day say that he said you
[18:59] can't tell me whether i got a right to
[19:00] marry or not mayor whatever i'm not
[19:02] going to try to
[19:05] you know
[19:07] but your own conscience or to condemn
[19:09] you if you don't it's like the prophet
[19:12] said you don't have no more conscience
[19:13] than a snake's got hips and
[19:15] so that's pretty blunt
[19:18] but now think about it
[19:21] jesus said go back to the beginning
[19:25] and look at the beginning
[19:28] and see if there's anything in the
[19:29] beginning
[19:30] because that's the seed chapter of it
[19:33] all right and i had these written down
[19:35] this morning kind of had to run through
[19:38] real fights
[19:40] but i had a bunch of questions
[19:43] you know
[19:44] to ask you
[19:46] i ran into it real quick but i want to
[19:48] go over it
[19:50] was there anything wrong
[19:53] in how god created adam and eve in
[19:56] the original creation you know eve in
[19:59] adam
[20:01] was anything wrong with that
[20:03] it was not according to the other
[20:04] creations right because he created
[20:07] male and female but when it comes
[20:09] to mankind he created adam
[20:12] and eve was in adam was anything wrong
[20:14] with that no
[20:17] then was there anything wrong in the
[20:19] fact that
[20:22] eve was taken from adam
[20:26] placed with adam in the garden
[20:30] and she would be a byproduct of adam
[20:32] right
[20:35] because you're the byproduct of your mom
[20:36] and daddy
[20:38] me
[20:39] see we use that byproduct as
[20:41] trying to use it as a bad thing
[20:45] but you need to go looking where i don't
[20:47] need rapster tell me i got a revelation
[20:50] all right my hands up
[20:52] you remember that this morning
[20:53] you just crossed yourself
[20:56] because if you can't take what you got
[20:58] by the english language what language
[21:01] you're going to put it in
[21:03] if in the english language a dog means a
[21:06] uh
[21:11] what a dog would mean a cat or a cat
[21:13] would mean a horse or what
[21:15] you got to have some form of language
[21:19] the prophet spoke in the english
[21:20] language
[21:22] all right
[21:24] now
[21:25] in doing that then we've got to get it
[21:27] to the right way
[21:28] there was nothing wrong when eve was
[21:30] taken from adam
[21:32] there's no sin
[21:35] and if you make her as i said this
[21:36] morning if you make her
[21:40] some outlandishly wrong thing as just a
[21:45] part of coming out of adam
[21:48] the
[21:49] then you're making god the author
[21:52] of whatever you're trying to say
[21:56] if you're saying that she was made so
[21:58] uh you know
[22:00] outlandishly
[22:01] sexy or whatever
[22:04] then you're making god the author of
[22:06] that
[22:09] see that's where you don't people don't
[22:10] even think about what they're saying
[22:12] they just say what they want to say and
[22:14] forget the rest
[22:19] but now watch
[22:21] in the original creation
[22:24] of adams and animals
[22:28] was there anything wrong in the way that
[22:30] the horses the dogs the cats etc were
[22:32] made
[22:33] they were made male and female
[22:36] they were made that way for a purpose
[22:39] what was that purpose
[22:41] for reproduction
[22:42] right
[22:44] because you know we get all these
[22:45] stories we look up all these things try
[22:47] to figure it out but the bible said he
[22:48] made male and female you know
[22:51] all right now
[22:57] then was there anything wrong
[23:01] with the fact that the male and female
[23:04] horse
[23:06] in that original creation
[23:09] was made and designed
[23:13] to reproduce
[23:20] come on the prophet said nothing in
[23:21] original creation right all right
[23:28] was there anything wrong with the female
[23:30] horse
[23:33] you know the male horse having a
[23:36] a relationship we call it
[23:40] for babies
[23:41] no
[23:43] that was all those four babies
[23:47] all right
[23:48] you go out yourself and you see it you
[23:50] you go out and you look at your dog said
[23:51] dog don't dier come to that female dog
[23:55] i mean you go to the lion which is the
[23:57] great big king that would want one thing
[23:59] and he could just
[24:02] kill a female but he won't touch that
[24:04] female
[24:06] she'll wear him out
[24:10] right
[24:12] but at a certain time
[24:15] then she comes to
[24:16] him and i was explaining to the bear
[24:20] especially into that because a lot of
[24:22] the animals do these things
[24:24] um
[24:25] you know there's amazing things in the
[24:27] animal kingdom that
[24:29] has come because of the fall we'll get
[24:31] to that i'm not going to express that
[24:32] this afternoon but
[24:34] because of the fall they get to a lot of
[24:36] things
[24:37] um
[24:39] that old boy buyer he'll he'll kill that
[24:41] baby it was his own baby that he had by
[24:43] her
[24:45] he'll kill it to worry she'll become
[24:47] receptive
[24:49] you know what she'll fight him to the
[24:51] death
[24:52] but then once that baby's dead and she's
[24:54] gone from in a while
[24:56] she'll go back and look up the bear
[24:59] because she's receptive again
[25:02] now
[25:03] that that is part of what you would call
[25:06] the the the
[25:08] you know the part of being a mother or
[25:10] being the instinct welling dwelling
[25:12] within them
[25:14] that is you know is dire
[25:18] you know
[25:22] because of the fall
[25:26] i ask you the question this morning
[25:28] that
[25:30] because of that fall
[25:35] polygamy comes into being
[25:38] but how did it come into being in the
[25:39] animals
[25:41] what caused them to go wrong
[25:46] see there's a lot of questions
[25:49] you know
[25:51] but i think if we get down far enough to
[25:52] find out what it is and what really
[25:54] happened in the garden we might find out
[25:56] a lot about other things too
[26:01] was there anything wrong with the
[26:03] animals being created
[26:06] with the
[26:08] desire or are
[26:12] you know thing to reproduce
[26:20] the only thing you can say that went
[26:21] wrong with eve is what i tried to bring
[26:23] out
[26:27] by
[26:27] being that she was created
[26:30] she was made with the ability to reason
[26:36] i hope he was listening to that very
[26:37] carefully
[26:40] adam
[26:43] evidently finally had the ability to
[26:45] reason because he did
[26:48] but yet he wouldn't listen to satan
[26:51] i remember one brother in this message
[26:52] used to preach it
[26:54] that
[26:55] that there was a male and a female beast
[26:57] well evidently there was because the
[26:58] bible says he made two you know male and
[27:00] female of each one and
[27:02] and the old brother used to preach
[27:04] and he had that female beast just
[27:07] flirting all around adam
[27:10] but it didn't bother adam
[27:16] he didn't reason
[27:18] but when the beast got around eaves he
[27:20] began to reason
[27:23] well we'll see we want to make
[27:24] everything so wrong but remember adam in
[27:27] the beginning
[27:28] he didn't let any reasoning come to pass
[27:33] you know he would not accept it
[27:36] you and i have that same
[27:38] thing right
[27:39] we can say yes or no
[27:41] about anything
[27:44] but yet if we begin to reason on
[27:46] it right
[27:49] see that's where we messed up
[27:53] was there anything wrong with eve having
[27:55] a
[27:55] motherly ability
[27:58] no
[28:00] she was created for that
[28:05] but see satan
[28:07] seduced her
[28:11] made her to start to think him
[28:15] and not being in the original creation
[28:19] when
[28:21] she was brought forth
[28:25] she was not a low degraded
[28:27] discrepant
[28:29] prostitute
[28:35] well yet that's what satan done
[28:38] brother brother says
[28:40] satan designed her have you noticed that
[28:42] marriage in divorce
[28:44] now did satan stand with god you know
[28:47] now
[28:48] you make her this way where i can get to
[28:50] her this way where i can do this
[28:55] now how did satan have anything to do
[28:58] with designing eve
[29:03] you should probably say
[29:05] satan designed her
[29:08] were
[29:09] in the fall
[29:12] come on
[29:13] in the fall he began to put into her
[29:16] mind
[29:17] his design his thoughts
[29:21] but not in the original
[29:24] creation let's see if we could stay that
[29:26] way what would it have been
[29:32] well we see we take
[29:34] my product and we say well that's what
[29:36] that's what it does she just made a bra
[29:39] well be careful you're going to have god
[29:41] creating her wrong
[29:47] but when he gave her a free moral agent
[29:49] see i got a question on that question
[29:51] was in the beginning of reason was it
[29:53] because she was a free moral agent
[29:55] that's exactly right
[29:58] adam now listen
[30:01] adam wasn't a free moral agent now you
[30:03] don't argue with me but listen to my
[30:05] point
[30:08] adam didn't have a choice for a wife
[30:13] right
[30:15] he didn't have a right to choose who he
[30:16] wanted
[30:20] see he never went into free world agency
[30:22] until
[30:23] she come into being
[30:25] and she come into being with a free
[30:26] moral agency
[30:29] and by using her free moral agency she
[30:32] caused him
[30:34] to
[30:37] walk into a freemore agency himself
[30:39] right
[30:41] right
[30:44] so to nazi you're gonna have god
[30:46] creating wrong
[30:50] instead of god creating her
[30:53] giving her body spirit and soul
[30:57] and that way she could reason
[31:02] all
[31:02] right that would be the original sin
[31:05] then
[31:07] it's the reason
[31:08] he said wait a minute now the bible says
[31:11] yeah i know
[31:12] blood bible
[31:15] the bible tells you not to reason right
[31:18] cast down reasoning
[31:20] yet it turns around and it says
[31:22] come let us reason together
[31:26] according to what you're doing with it
[31:28] right
[31:30] it's got a lot to do with it but see by
[31:32] being a free moral agent then eve could
[31:35] accept reasoning
[31:38] and when she did she went into the
[31:40] perversion
[31:43] so you ask most people even in this
[31:44] message what is the seed of the serpent
[31:50] you know
[31:52] and they'll explain to you the sex act
[31:53] that took place by even the beast
[31:57] right
[31:59] and that's the way most people do it
[32:02] but you see the seed of the serpent
[32:05] that's why i gave you that quote this
[32:07] morning tied with marriage and divorce
[32:09] but around said the seed of the serpent
[32:10] comes into view
[32:14] see the seed of the serpent was the
[32:16] reasoning that satan placed in the mind
[32:20] of eve
[32:26] you understand amen
[32:32] see we say we're deceived sure all of us
[32:35] humanly speaking these bodies
[32:38] came by eve and the beast
[32:42] let me put it correctly though even
[32:43] satan right around and said not even the
[32:46] beast because everybody's not off even
[32:47] the beast
[32:48] some are vegan the beast and some are
[32:50] even adam
[32:53] because that's a genetic makeup but it's
[32:54] so much infiltrated together until you
[32:56] can't separate it no more
[32:59] but it's even the serpent that brought
[33:01] us wrong
[33:03] right
[33:04] all right
[33:06] now
[33:07] this is the one i had this morning but
[33:09] didn't have time to
[33:14] brother random says prayer of page 216
[33:17] 215 excuse me church age book
[33:20] and that weakness in her allowed satan
[33:23] to seduce her
[33:24] by way of the serpent
[33:26] and has brought the woman to a very
[33:28] peculiar position before god in his word
[33:31] she is the type of all things vulgar
[33:33] fowl
[33:35] loves
[33:36] loathsome on the one hand
[33:39] and on the other hand
[33:41] she is the type of all-time clean and
[33:43] beautiful and holy
[33:47] now
[33:49] so we can get our own little reasonings
[33:51] in
[33:54] and you know by doing that we decide
[33:56] which one we want to be
[33:58] whether we want to be the vulgar lowsome
[34:00] or whatever
[34:03] all right
[34:04] i'll get to this in a minute
[34:06] more but
[34:08] was this was the act
[34:11] between even the beast
[34:13] the seed of the serpent
[34:16] no that was the seed of the beast
[34:21] come on
[34:23] you got to think
[34:30] cain came from the beast
[34:34] that was his father
[34:37] right right amen
[34:40] see
[34:41] abel came from adam that was his father
[34:45] that's not the seed of the serpent
[34:50] satan don't have a physical seed amen
[34:59] so the seed of the serpent is different
[35:01] from the seed of the beast
[35:06] the seed of the serpent is not a
[35:07] physical
[35:10] germs genes whatever you want to call
[35:12] all those words it makes up a
[35:15] a seed
[35:18] the seed of the serpent was where satan
[35:20] went straight to eve's
[35:22] reasoning factor that's right
[35:28] all right
[35:30] it caused her to
[35:35] commit adultery
[35:42] you see to the serpent is unbelief
[35:45] amen
[35:46] that's the only seed satan has
[35:50] he has no ability to produce another
[35:52] child
[35:54] that's right
[35:56] so right brother said in the church
[35:57] eight book he said so thereby he
[35:59] vicariously used the beast
[36:02] to bring to pisces to inject himself
[36:04] into the human race
[36:08] so separate your thoughts
[36:15] what is the seed of the serpent unbelief
[36:20] what is the seed of the beast cain
[36:24] that's what he wound up being with him
[36:25] because it was a sex act
[36:28] all right
[36:29] we're just dealing back there to try to
[36:31] find out what the fall is today
[36:34] let's read a few things about this
[36:35] because you may not agree
[36:38] to what i was bringing out this morning
[36:40] and then started doing over again
[36:46] that in the animal kingdom the female
[36:49] was given to the male to reproduce the
[36:50] male
[36:52] right
[36:53] right
[36:57] all right
[37:01] now i like to cover things where the
[37:03] people that are carnality won't jump up
[37:05] a worm can be both male or female but
[37:07] that's still a male and female
[37:08] irregardless what you want to do with it
[37:11] right
[37:13] it's still a male and a female
[37:15] it don't matter if it's all the same
[37:16] worm
[37:18] i just do that word that somebody come
[37:19] along on the internet and they say boy
[37:21] you don't know what he's talking about
[37:23] but listen
[37:28] then
[37:30] the reproduction of the animal was the
[37:32] purpose
[37:34] of the fact of them being made male and
[37:36] female
[37:40] well
[37:41] was it not the same for eve and adam
[37:45] as i said this morning i keep saying it
[37:48] whether it would be a literal act
[37:49] between the two or whether they spoke
[37:51] the child into existence
[37:53] it'd still take both of them
[37:57] if you want my opinion adam was having
[37:59] to wait until eve come to the right
[38:01] place
[38:02] she just didn't make it
[38:05] if she'd come to the right place they
[38:06] would have been the
[38:08] babies spoken into existence or whatever
[38:11] you want to call it
[38:12] you argue that point
[38:16] i'm just a preacher
[38:20] well let's see what brother branham said
[38:21] about
[38:23] this
[38:23] by-product
[38:26] and what her purpose was go ahead with
[38:27] number one brother
[38:32] over you must be born again paragraph or
[38:34] e34
[38:36] 58 619
[38:39] b
[38:41] he looked wonderful but he was lonesome
[38:43] talking about the man the creation the
[38:45] birds flew out he wooed over them the
[38:47] animals came forth he kept cooing and a
[38:50] man came up he looked wonderful but he
[38:52] was lonesome
[38:54] he he had no help mate
[38:57] so to see that i want you to be real
[38:59] sticky now i want this to be real sticky
[39:01] now
[39:03] god never put the woman in the original
[39:05] creation
[39:07] all right
[39:09] she's a byproduct of the man
[39:14] man and woman was one
[39:16] a woman in the beginning he took the
[39:18] woman from adam
[39:23] and a man and wife are really one
[39:27] he's not
[39:28] degrading the
[39:30] byproduct
[39:34] he's putting it to a position
[39:36] that we read this morning where that
[39:38] right around said that she was co-equal
[39:42] in her natural creation
[39:44] now my point of co-equal
[39:48] we were asking some questions some
[39:49] talking while ago and i love that
[39:52] but when you look at adam and eve as
[39:54] co-equal
[39:57] i'm funny i know natural
[40:00] i don't believe when she was made
[40:01] co-equal that meant both of them was
[40:03] exactly the same height
[40:08] and both of them looked exactly like
[40:12] sorry
[40:16] you know what i believe
[40:20] if you ever want to see a woman that was
[40:22] under subjection to her husband
[40:26] eve was one
[40:31] before the fall
[40:35] okay
[40:39] adam was her head
[40:43] he's like the hens
[40:45] the rooster
[40:47] the head
[40:51] the horse
[40:54] you know the prophet he said all the
[40:56] animal kingdom all of the females were
[40:58] uglier than the male but said in the
[41:00] human kingdom she's made beautiful
[41:04] that would've been a wonderful thing to
[41:06] be able to go back and see adam and eve
[41:08] in the garden and how long they were and
[41:10] brother around said god would come down
[41:12] in the cool of the evening and say my
[41:14] children have you enjoyed your day in
[41:17] the garden
[41:20] yes father we've enjoyed it he said come
[41:23] and lay them down and they go to sleep
[41:27] you've heard brother branham say that
[41:28] eve would say
[41:31] adam it's a little windy today
[41:34] and he'd say peace be still
[41:37] see she didn't stop that let's go don't
[41:39] go change that wind
[41:41] no that didn't come until the fall
[41:46] so if we're going back the other way
[41:47] maybe your sister's order to consider
[41:49] that point
[41:52] go back and let your husband be the head
[41:54] now that's not saying it the way it
[41:55] needs to be said oh you know like a lady
[41:58] said one time said i let my husband be
[42:00] my head now you don't let god be your
[42:02] head you don't let your husband be your
[42:04] head
[42:05] he is either your head or he's not your
[42:07] head
[42:09] and if he's not your head you the head
[42:17] everybody look around grin at each other
[42:22] but think about it
[42:25] the woman in the beginning
[42:27] he took the woman from adam pull it back
[42:28] up brother
[42:34] and the man and wife are really one
[42:37] but that was done to reproduce
[42:39] themselves again
[42:43] to put them in the flesh
[42:45] in flesh
[42:46] but he took the feminist part of the man
[42:48] and made a woman out of it
[42:50] now is there anything wrong with her
[42:54] is she standing there by product
[43:00] right
[43:03] went through part of this one this
[43:04] morning but
[43:06] go ahead with number two
[43:10] pergamon church age page 171 church age
[43:12] book
[43:14] that'd be number two
[43:18] the first son adam was the spoken
[43:20] seed word of god
[43:23] he was given a bride to reproduce
[43:25] himself
[43:29] that is why the bride was given to him
[43:31] to reproduce himself
[43:33] to produce another son of god
[43:35] but she failed by her
[43:37] hybridizing she caused him to die
[43:42] we know that's what happened
[43:46] but she was to reproduce him
[43:48] he gave you this one this morning what
[43:50] number three
[43:52] questions and answered on hebrews
[43:56] what have we got paragraph
[43:58] 393
[44:00] he was in he was he has a spirit in him
[44:03] a man does when he's born because he's
[44:06] the spirit of nature it's the spirit of
[44:07] the world that's the spirit of the god
[44:09] of this world he's merely an offspring
[44:10] of adam all right the tree reproduces
[44:13] itself vegetation reproduces animals
[44:15] reproduce themselves humans reproduce
[44:17] themselves there are the byproduct of
[44:20] original creation says he get it
[44:25] you're a byproduct of your mom and daddy
[44:28] does that make the byproduct a bad thing
[44:33] no
[44:34] right
[44:36] what they done
[44:40] they what eve done
[44:44] now can i say just a few natural words
[44:48] the animals in the garden must have been
[44:50] reproducing before the fall
[44:53] and you say well how do you know that
[44:55] well
[44:58] maybe just a simple little reasoning
[45:00] factor
[45:02] all right oh we're not supposed to reap
[45:05] well just listen and see
[45:10] where did all them other extra animals
[45:11] wind up in the book of genesis
[45:13] if there was only one male and one
[45:15] female
[45:21] all right
[45:23] where did god get those animals that he
[45:26] slew the skin took the skins off of them
[45:28] and
[45:29] clothed adam and
[45:30] eve it's simple
[45:34] it takes simple logic a lot of times and
[45:36] answers a lot of questions
[45:38] that's right
[45:39] oh but i got to get a revelation when
[45:41] you can't get a revelation until you get
[45:43] a head knowledge
[45:45] because god don't drop it down out of
[45:46] the sky to you
[45:48] all right
[45:50] so here we are in the garden with
[45:53] adam and eve was going to
[45:56] in one way or the other
[45:59] she was going to reproduce adam
[46:04] the other animals were
[46:06] already reproducing
[46:09] and the beast that's what he could
[46:11] explain
[46:12] he knew she had a now here's the problem
[46:14] he said satan had a knowledge of the
[46:16] principles of life
[46:18] okay you need that quote i'll be glad to
[46:20] get it for you
[46:21] so by doing that he knew how to get to
[46:23] eve
[46:27] so he begins to get her to reason
[46:29] over everything and
[46:32] he says that's what you're right for
[46:36] and he could turn around and since you
[46:37] see the animals
[46:42] and said
[46:45] they're
[46:46] reproducing
[46:48] and there wasn't anything wrong with it
[46:50] was it
[46:53] still not anything wrong with the
[46:55] animals reproducing right
[46:57] that's nature
[47:00] so the beast he had something to get her
[47:02] to reason about
[47:06] and you got her to reason to the fact of
[47:08] what she was there for
[47:10] and her motherly instinct began to move
[47:16] and when it did it caused a fall to take
[47:18] place
[47:21] but now
[47:24] it wasn't no five minute of fire i don't
[47:27] believe
[47:28] right don't tell them how long
[47:30] satan reasoned with eve
[47:34] because when he first told her about it
[47:36] she probably said ain't listening to you
[47:42] but then she began to reason
[47:46] and to take into consideration and you
[47:48] know what what he was telling her
[47:52] was the truth
[47:57] are you with me yes
[47:59] was he telling her a lie
[48:02] no
[48:05] he was telling her the animals are doing
[48:06] it and you're made for that to reproduce
[48:08] adam
[48:13] with no lie in that the bible had done
[48:15] told them
[48:16] genesis 1 26-27 or 27-28 then multiply
[48:19] and replenish the earth
[48:23] while she was in adam and theophany
[48:28] she was told to multiply and replenish
[48:32] and when he come into flesh you don't
[48:34] want your modification but then when the
[48:37] when the flood came
[48:38] and mankind went forth
[48:40] it was told our in scripture you know
[48:43] multiply and replenish the earth
[48:47] all right
[48:48] but now
[48:51] what went wrong was with him telling her
[48:55] what she was made for
[48:58] and she began to reason upon that factor
[49:01] right
[49:02] instead of waiting for adam is that the
[49:04] words of the prophet do you need that
[49:07] so she didn't wait for adam
[49:13] but now listen
[49:16] as she begin to reason
[49:21] now it's in here somewhere if i miss it
[49:24] don't have time you
[49:26] you you just ask me later don't you but
[49:28] around said it's impossible for a woman
[49:30] to have an affair with a man
[49:32] until she first accepts him in her mind
[49:35] you are not talking about a rape
[49:39] right
[49:40] i will get to that when we're going
[49:42] along a girl that is raped is not
[49:45] she hasn't lost anything right
[49:49] we will get down to that
[49:51] because she can't help it
[49:55] he said well she don't have this but
[49:59] your reasoning
[50:02] but listen
[50:06] what is sin
[50:12] what is sin
[50:16] we can all quote quickly that it's
[50:18] unbelief can't we yes
[50:21] but why don't we quote that
[50:23] the serpent seed is
[50:25] sin
[50:26] unbelief instead of quoting the serpent
[50:28] seed is a literal act
[50:31] i hope that dwelled on you a minute ago
[50:34] eve had a relationship with a beast
[50:37] that brought cain into the line right
[50:41] but she had the original sin which is
[50:43] unbelief
[50:47] she took that beast's idea
[50:49] into her being and and become so
[50:51] engulfed with it until she finally
[50:53] produced it
[50:55] same as the prophet said a woman can't
[50:56] have a relationship
[50:58] until she first has one in her
[51:00] mind
[51:07] so let's read a few things now
[51:09] let's think about just keep our thoughts
[51:11] on this unbelief a minute
[51:13] go ahead with number four
[51:17] the results of sin
[51:19] are executing the results of a decision
[51:22] 55 1008
[51:24] paragraph 73 there's only one sin and
[51:26] that sin is unbelief
[51:28] smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey
[51:30] telling lies
[51:31] committing adultery now what did we
[51:33] start off with that eve done it we'll
[51:35] get back to it eve committed adultery
[51:39] her committing adultery
[51:42] is not sin
[51:45] it's an attribute
[51:47] she had already sinned or she would not
[51:50] have let
[51:51] the adulterous act taken place
[51:54] that's why i emphasize that
[51:57] committed that's not sin that's
[52:00] attributes of sin you do that because
[52:01] you're a sinner
[52:03] that's what makes you do it see not sin
[52:06] itself that's just what the distraught
[52:08] results are sin
[52:09] now and the only sin there is is unbelie
[52:12] is his unbelief he that believeth not is
[52:14] condemned already in jesus
[52:16] matthew saint john 3 see
[52:19] you've got to you you don't believe
[52:21] there's only two
[52:23] facilities
[52:24] right you pronounce it
[52:26] one of them is unbelief and the other
[52:27] one is faith
[52:29] if you believe
[52:31] you are
[52:33] if you do not believe you are not
[52:35] that's the only thing
[52:38] see we need to get down you remember
[52:40] brother branham talking about that one
[52:41] day
[52:42] he's preaching away and he's talking
[52:44] about whiskey drinking and no it's not a
[52:46] sin
[52:47] and little sister
[52:49] brother branham
[52:52] what is sin
[52:54] he says unbelief
[52:58] see we've been taught all of our life
[53:00] right
[53:03] you're going to die and go to hell for
[53:05] commitment adultery
[53:08] you won't die and go to hell for
[53:12] smoking drinking we standing one day at
[53:15] my
[53:16] mother-in-law's and the neighbor was
[53:17] cutting grass
[53:19] there was a lady visiting with
[53:21] my mother-in-law and him
[53:23] she said one of these days he'll die and
[53:24] go to hell for that
[53:26] it's kind of no sunday
[53:31] see that was her
[53:33] he gonna die and go to hell he now no
[53:35] hopes
[53:36] he cut his grass on sunday
[53:43] we life at that
[53:46] but still how much does that bear upon
[53:48] our mind
[53:54] you know that some people believe the
[53:56] reason they're saved is because they've
[53:57] never done anything wrong
[54:04] true
[54:06] we find out that's not exactly what fits
[54:09] is it that's right
[54:12] we don't justify doing wrong but it's
[54:13] always one that done
[54:15] more wrong is more it i have to get
[54:17] forgiveness because they want it
[54:19] right
[54:23] but do we actually understand
[54:26] that there's only one sin
[54:29] and that's unbelief
[54:32] now you can see what he's done
[54:38] see by that you can see what happened to
[54:40] eve
[54:43] and you can see that that still happens
[54:45] to you and i
[54:50] uh
[54:52] he said but i'm a christian
[54:55] did your prophet make this statement he
[54:57] said only christians have sins
[55:00] but i can't sin
[55:02] bless god
[55:03] i know better than that
[55:05] where'd you get it from
[55:07] what school did you go to i went to the
[55:10] bible the bible said it it seems
[55:12] reminiscent oh
[55:14] it says if it sees remains in you you
[55:16] cannot sin
[55:18] it didn't say you can't sin
[55:21] show me a scripture says you can't sin
[55:28] we just don't put it to the sin of
[55:32] blaspheming the sin of total unbelief
[55:36] because anything's not a faith is sin
[55:40] i ate too much at lunch i should have
[55:42] had one hamburger
[55:44] i ate two
[55:48] i know better i'll burp
[55:52] he said well that's silly no anything's
[55:53] not a faith is sin
[55:57] so don't worry about trying to figure
[55:58] out whether you sinned or not just
[55:59] remember you already are
[56:02] he's born that way
[56:04] all right
[56:06] but do you understand
[56:09] those things are not sin
[56:13] they're attributes of unbelief
[56:16] now
[56:18] if you tell me say well brother dale
[56:19] define a little bit darlin
[56:23] are you saying that it's okay to go out
[56:25] and commit adultery
[56:26] as long as you say i believe
[56:31] no no
[56:33] don't accuse me of stupidity
[56:35] dumb yeah
[56:37] stupid
[56:42] see when you go back to the garden and
[56:44] you ask people what happens you have to
[56:45] match most of the people in the medicine
[56:46] what happened in the garden to cause all
[56:48] this trouble
[56:49] he had a relationship with the beast
[56:52] that's all i know
[56:55] right
[56:59] see she had her spiritual intercourse
[57:02] with satan
[57:04] in her mind did you understand the words
[57:06] i used spiritual intercourse
[57:10] with satan in her mind did she begin to
[57:12] reason
[57:17] you don't have a reason
[57:22] i wonder what the world brotherdale's
[57:23] getting at
[57:24] that's pretty good reason
[57:37] all of the things let me explain this
[57:39] one
[57:41] going over to number eight where i get
[57:42] back and preach a little
[57:44] over to number eight
[57:46] which is from the spoken words original
[57:48] seed book two
[57:49] 1962 318 paragraph 180 through 180
[57:56] we let the prophet say it
[57:58] that's how adultery just a minute he's
[58:00] explaining it right that's how adultery
[58:02] is committed spiritually
[58:04] when you knowing better
[58:07] by the word of god
[58:10] by the intercourse of the mind
[58:12] take in a lie of the devil against the
[58:15] word of god
[58:19] now if we do that we're unbelievers
[58:22] now the if i don't know the bible says
[58:25] so and so
[58:27] you know when i'm doing those things i'm
[58:28] not an unbeliever right
[58:30] but when knowledge comes
[58:32] i can prove whether or not i'm believer
[58:33] or not
[58:34] look what he says
[58:37] see knowing better by the word of god by
[58:39] the intercourse of the mind taking a lie
[58:41] of the devil against the word of god
[58:42] that's exactly what he's done
[58:45] with a spiritual intercourse
[58:47] first
[58:50] that come by believing satan's lie
[58:54] into the wound of her mind
[58:56] that polluted her soul set death in the
[58:59] soul and the natural natural act taken
[59:02] place
[59:05] now
[59:06] and that's the only way that a woman can
[59:08] ever commit adultery against her husband
[59:11] is to first let some man talk her into
[59:14] it and then receive another man that's
[59:16] not her husband then she's committed
[59:18] adultery
[59:21] and well i got you there brother dale
[59:22] because you believe the soldier okay
[59:25] just don't crow
[59:28] remember up until 1962 about the
[59:30] greatest battle ever fought
[59:32] brother random was teaching that you're
[59:34] a triune being
[59:36] he says your body
[59:40] soul spirit
[59:43] but then after 62 long in the greatest
[59:45] battle ever fought
[59:47] he began to explain and said you're a
[59:49] triune being your body spirit and soul
[59:55] so now we need back your dealing about
[59:57] eve
[59:58] it was her second part of her being that
[1:00:00] reasons right
[1:00:01] no matter what you call it
[1:00:04] brother branham always gave five senses
[1:00:06] for the
[1:00:07] outside man five senses for the second
[1:00:10] part of man no matter what he called it
[1:00:12] soul or spirit
[1:00:13] and one sense for the soul
[1:00:16] or the intervening
[1:00:18] so he's talking about eve in the
[1:00:20] reasoning
[1:00:22] into her mind
[1:00:27] she accepted satan's lie
[1:00:31] and she did then she had the natural act
[1:00:35] with the beast
[1:00:36] that was talking to her
[1:00:39] do you see what happened in the garden
[1:00:41] you see where unbelief
[1:00:42] is the original sin
[1:00:45] and you see unbelief then is the serpent
[1:00:47] seed
[1:00:48] because that's the only seed he has
[1:00:53] is this the seed of disbelief
[1:00:58] he has no word of his own don't thought
[1:01:00] of his own he perverts god's word amen
[1:01:06] but he'll tell you the 99.99 truth
[1:01:15] as i said while ago about him did the
[1:01:17] devil tell eve wrong
[1:01:22] he told her what the animals were doing
[1:01:24] he told her what she was capable of
[1:01:26] doing
[1:01:28] he just didn't tell her that it was the
[1:01:30] wrong way of going about it with him
[1:01:37] right
[1:01:44] what is it then
[1:01:52] brother brown says on the imagine
[1:01:54] divorce
[1:01:56] we read it this morning it's a foremost
[1:01:57] question in everybody's mind
[1:02:01] he said believers and not unbelievers
[1:02:02] he's called unbelievers don't care
[1:02:05] but he said believers are always wanting
[1:02:07] to be concerned about themselves right
[1:02:13] you don't have a
[1:02:14] conscious part about you that
[1:02:16] is desiring to do good
[1:02:22] you you don't have something to condemn
[1:02:24] you
[1:02:25] when you do do wrong
[1:02:30] even the moral obligation of a human
[1:02:32] being is to do good
[1:02:38] i told you when i was a center i'd go
[1:02:40] out and do things wrong i'd come home
[1:02:42] i felt dirty i felt
[1:02:45] and i would actually i didn't know how
[1:02:46] to crowd to god but i would be sorry for
[1:02:48] what i'd done
[1:02:51] and there were some things i didn't do
[1:02:54] because of a moral obligation
[1:02:57] i would not in no way ever fool with a
[1:02:59] married woman
[1:03:00] that was a built inside of me
[1:03:03] thing that would not
[1:03:05] i didn't have to decide whether or to or
[1:03:07] not that was already decided
[1:03:13] but listen church
[1:03:16] eve committed adultery
[1:03:19] that's what brought forth the first
[1:03:21] child
[1:03:22] which was cain
[1:03:25] come on that's marriage and divorce
[1:03:26] paragraph 58.
[1:03:30] that's what brought cain
[1:03:33] the unbelief she had is what brought
[1:03:36] death
[1:03:37] upon all
[1:03:42] mankind the act was
[1:03:45] the attribute
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:49] drinking gambling smoking is what
[1:03:51] attributes of unbelief
[1:03:54] you do it because you're not a believer
[1:03:58] brother dale i believe it's wrong to do
[1:03:59] that
[1:04:01] we'll
[1:04:02] quit
[1:04:05] it's no problem
[1:04:07] quit blocking we'll go get help
[1:04:13] i never did figure out how you could
[1:04:15] chew on a blue cigarette and
[1:04:17] claim to be smoking and it'd satisfy you
[1:04:19] but
[1:04:20] you know
[1:04:23] i mean i've always just been dogmatic i
[1:04:24] guess if
[1:04:26] it didn't fit i just took it off
[1:04:28] you know
[1:04:30] i don't like tight clothes and stuff
[1:04:31] like that
[1:04:33] it don't fit now i don't want to handle
[1:04:34] none of it
[1:04:37] but listen church
[1:04:40] what was the fall in the garden
[1:04:45] he said it was just an act between a
[1:04:47] beast and an eve
[1:04:49] now that's the attribute that's what
[1:04:51] happened
[1:04:52] because of the fall
[1:04:55] she had already fallen it didn't matter
[1:04:57] whether she went and had the act or not
[1:05:01] you want scripture for it
[1:05:05] i thought jesus said
[1:05:07] if you look on a woman to lust after in
[1:05:09] your heart
[1:05:11] you've already committed adultery that's
[1:05:14] what i thought he said
[1:05:19] it didn't matter what he'd done after
[1:05:21] she had taken satan's lie
[1:05:25] she had already brought sin
[1:05:28] unbelief
[1:05:31] upon mankind
[1:05:35] she died right there
[1:05:37] we know she did not physically
[1:05:42] but she set death in the human
[1:05:48] race so that's why you get into it and
[1:05:51] see that you can be forgiven of all sin
[1:05:53] except what
[1:06:00] now come on
[1:06:02] and you've got a marriage problems or
[1:06:03] hat or whatever
[1:06:05] you're not going to die and go to hell
[1:06:06] because of your marital problem
[1:06:11] if you did that would put
[1:06:13] salvation and things up on the basis of
[1:06:16] what you do or don't do
[1:06:22] well we're going to die and go to hell
[1:06:23] for unbelief
[1:06:26] all right
[1:06:27] and if we don't believe god made a way
[1:06:32] and what's the problem with serving him
[1:06:35] that's right i said this morning
[1:06:37] thinking about that brothers
[1:06:39] spending so much time going through the
[1:06:41] bible
[1:06:42] taking little things
[1:06:44] this one said this and this one said
[1:06:46] this
[1:06:49] oh man look look at it brother have you
[1:06:52] have you seen that video
[1:06:54] he explains on there all of these wrongs
[1:06:56] in the bible
[1:06:58] and he's also explained now brother
[1:06:59] brandon was wrong he's also explained
[1:07:01] how jesus was wrong
[1:07:04] and but he's real popular
[1:07:11] he said what are you calling him i call
[1:07:12] him nothing
[1:07:15] ain't going to call him either
[1:07:22] but listen church
[1:07:25] unbelief
[1:07:28] he that believeth not is condemned
[1:07:30] already
[1:07:35] well let me ask you a simple question of
[1:07:37] you to think about seriously
[1:07:42] anywhere you was at or any time you came
[1:07:44] to salvation you know
[1:07:48] what was you thinking about when you
[1:07:50] were trying to deal with the lord about
[1:07:51] salvation
[1:07:56] you were thinking about what you'd done
[1:07:58] wrong
[1:08:00] is that true
[1:08:03] lord i might not have been like some of
[1:08:05] these others but i've got some bad
[1:08:06] problems
[1:08:09] right
[1:08:12] when you start talking about salvation
[1:08:14] people immediately
[1:08:16] we all do i do
[1:08:18] we think about what we've done or didn't
[1:08:19] do
[1:08:24] how many times have you ever heard me
[1:08:26] make this statement
[1:08:30] if you ever thank god
[1:08:33] for bringing you out of a denominational
[1:08:36] church i really seriously thank them
[1:08:44] and you know how i preach it i don't
[1:08:46] preach the wrong of all of that
[1:08:48] they had their times
[1:08:51] and they're still good people out there
[1:08:55] wonderful people
[1:08:59] but yet when you're caught by
[1:09:01] denominational fornication spirit
[1:09:06] you're in unbelief
[1:09:10] and unbelief is sin
[1:09:17] now you could tell jesus that
[1:09:20] he was wrong about
[1:09:23] oh creating wine
[1:09:26] he did that didn't he
[1:09:29] you know someone probably got drunk off
[1:09:31] the wine he created
[1:09:38] you could
[1:09:39] condemn him about
[1:09:41] uh beating the money changers running
[1:09:44] them out of the temple
[1:09:45] well that was that was happening to
[1:09:47] people the people couldn't go out here
[1:09:48] and do all this right that happened to
[1:09:49] people they were doing a good job
[1:09:52] he said
[1:09:54] you made my house a a den of thieves
[1:10:01] well you know in the natural what they
[1:10:02] were doing is pocketing the money that
[1:10:04] was coming in they didn't turn it into
[1:10:06] the priests to give it over to the to
[1:10:08] the temple
[1:10:09] it's taking a little out of the tale of
[1:10:11] it
[1:10:14] but you know what i love about the
[1:10:16] scripture
[1:10:19] jesus said one day he said
[1:10:22] the devil cometh
[1:10:24] and have nothing in
[1:10:28] me he said show me where i've ever
[1:10:31] disbelieved
[1:10:33] right
[1:10:35] is that jesus talking
[1:10:38] show me wherever disbelieved
[1:10:41] yet you could tell him all about what he
[1:10:43] done
[1:10:49] you see church we need to get down to
[1:10:50] find out what sin really is
[1:10:55] well you think it's all right just go
[1:10:57] out and do anything you want to
[1:10:58] i didn't know i said that
[1:11:01] does anybody
[1:11:02] anybody get that out of what i've said
[1:11:06] well you're just saying it's not
[1:11:08] sin no it's not sin you're an unbeliever
[1:11:11] that's the reason you drink and smoke
[1:11:13] and run around you're an unbeliever
[1:11:17] get to be a believer he'll take care of
[1:11:18] it
[1:11:21] amen see that only one
[1:11:24] sin a sin of unbelief
[1:11:29] there wasn't any sin in the way was
[1:11:31] created
[1:11:34] oh we've been through that now two
[1:11:35] services
[1:11:39] is what she done with it
[1:11:45] there's nothing more beautiful than a
[1:11:49] a pure
[1:11:51] virgin
[1:11:53] young girl
[1:11:56] a great honor
[1:12:00] you know that brother random even
[1:12:01] explains that
[1:12:03] my wife being a virgin when we married
[1:12:06] if i die she could marry again right
[1:12:09] scripturally she could marry again
[1:12:12] you know she's
[1:12:13] still a virgin
[1:12:16] if she was one to start with
[1:12:19] she's a virgin second he dies the third
[1:12:21] one you remember they got into it the
[1:12:23] brother died this and died
[1:12:25] who's gonna be when we get over there
[1:12:27] you know
[1:12:30] he said this ain't no giving in marriage
[1:12:32] or anything we're not gonna be there as
[1:12:34] husband and wife
[1:12:37] now we will be recognized as husband and
[1:12:39] wife but not to be there as husband and
[1:12:41] wife for reproduction
[1:12:48] because he already tried to think ahead
[1:12:50] what you're thinking
[1:12:56] see when you say a man and his wife is
[1:12:57] the type of christ in the church
[1:13:02] david with his
[1:13:04] thousand wives he was the type of christ
[1:13:06] in the church
[1:13:08] is him being one because they couldn't
[1:13:10] help no other husband
[1:13:12] he said yeah but there's brother random
[1:13:14] got two wives
[1:13:16] not at the same time
[1:13:19] you better back up
[1:13:22] not at the same time
[1:13:25] one died
[1:13:27] he was able to marry again
[1:13:29] that's scripturally legal
[1:13:32] all right
[1:13:34] but you say well when we get to heaven
[1:13:35] is he going to have two wives
[1:13:41] why would you think like that
[1:13:47] well i i want to know who i'm going to
[1:13:49] be with when i get there
[1:13:57] why
[1:14:01] there won't be no
[1:14:03] kids born in heaven
[1:14:06] there won't be no desires and thoughts
[1:14:08] and ideas that's right amen
[1:14:14] you know the thing you can find where
[1:14:15] brother brown said it this way he said
[1:14:17] but we will have clothes on when we get
[1:14:18] there
[1:14:22] the ones he saw beyond the curtain of
[1:14:23] time had on long robes
[1:14:28] we ain't going to be there naked running
[1:14:30] around
[1:14:32] we don't come through all of that
[1:14:35] we're supposed to be going to perfection
[1:14:38] not if there'll be any sex acts or
[1:14:40] thoughts and ideas there
[1:14:42] it's just a form of what we've done
[1:14:49] you see church
[1:14:50] there's a lot of things maybe that needs
[1:14:52] to be explained
[1:14:55] about marriage and divorce
[1:14:58] we'll try to go through a few things but
[1:15:01] just like today i just wanted to bring
[1:15:03] it out and showed it in the beginning it
[1:15:04] wasn't so
[1:15:06] and run said and it won't be so over
[1:15:08] there
[1:15:15] so you can see people's mind is what you
[1:15:17] you don't have to have discernment
[1:15:21] you don't have to discern and see what
[1:15:22] people thinking
[1:15:24] look at their face
[1:15:26] we were sitting one day talking about
[1:15:27] going to hell when you heard me say it
[1:15:29] and this lady she wasn't much of a
[1:15:31] christian but
[1:15:32] you know she kind of
[1:15:34] thought about her body being beautiful
[1:15:38] well something was said and you could
[1:15:39] just see it on her
[1:15:43] i'll be beautiful
[1:15:46] freckles are beautiful
[1:15:54] did you understand what i just said
[1:15:57] molds are a perversion of life but
[1:15:59] freckles is not necessarily perversion
[1:16:01] right
[1:16:05] right
[1:16:07] but you see church we want to put
[1:16:09] everything into our own little cubicle
[1:16:11] our own little thinking and ideas
[1:16:13] well you're just destroying my idea
[1:16:17] oh thank god
[1:16:19] what are you going to do about it
[1:16:26] see because when we start explaining
[1:16:27] brother brown starts explaining that the
[1:16:29] drinking gambling smoking is not
[1:16:31] seeing
[1:16:32] people boy this guy believes he can just
[1:16:35] do anything in the world now he didn't
[1:16:37] say that
[1:16:42] he said if you are a believer you don't
[1:16:44] do them things right
[1:16:56] you need any help i'll explain it to you
[1:16:59] an unbeliever
[1:17:04] see the way god created things was
[1:17:06] beautiful
[1:17:11] now you're gonna
[1:17:12] maybe argue this point but listen
[1:17:15] with eve created with the ability to
[1:17:17] even the reason
[1:17:23] was a beautiful thing
[1:17:36] okay
[1:17:41] the bible says come let us reason
[1:17:43] together
[1:17:48] there's nothing wrong the prophet said
[1:17:50] with your reasonings
[1:17:51] if it is placed correctly
[1:17:54] do you need them quotes
[1:18:01] is there anything wrong with sister
[1:18:03] gayle
[1:18:04] reasoning that brother dick is the
[1:18:05] prettiest guy in the world
[1:18:10] he says that he is found
[1:18:15] you see church that's where we left and
[1:18:17] the things that we should have hold
[1:18:19] held on to it
[1:18:22] when he was made the way she was made
[1:18:25] and she took that
[1:18:27] and stayed there
[1:18:30] brother randall said you sisters are
[1:18:32] made
[1:18:34] with a virtue that you must not
[1:18:38] destroy
[1:18:41] there wasn't anything wrong with eve
[1:18:44] walking in the garden beside of adam
[1:18:47] and looking up there you know and said
[1:18:49] adam
[1:18:51] adam i love you
[1:18:55] you're my husband you're my head
[1:19:02] because i don't guess all you women tell
[1:19:04] you about your husband that you love
[1:19:05] them now do you
[1:19:10] do you ever tell us i love you
[1:19:13] you ever mean it
[1:19:22] you see church
[1:19:24] if a man and his wife is the type of
[1:19:25] christ in the church
[1:19:27] why can't the man and the wife be a
[1:19:28] wonderful pair of people put together
[1:19:31] that if you listen to what we were
[1:19:32] bringing this morning and thought about
[1:19:34] it that god hath joined together and let
[1:19:36] not man put us under
[1:19:38] if god joins you together as husband and
[1:19:40] wife you're one
[1:19:42] if man joins you you're not one
[1:19:46] you never will be until you both get
[1:19:47] born again
[1:19:49] that's why you're commanded not to marry
[1:19:50] an unbeliever
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:53] you're not supposed to marry an
[1:19:54] unbeliever
[1:19:57] he's supposed to marry a christian
[1:20:03] now
[1:20:09] to think about it
[1:20:13] i'll lay this part down and pick it up
[1:20:15] wednesday
[1:20:21] but brother dale you said this morning
[1:20:23] you gave some quotes from brother
[1:20:24] branham that eve committed adultery
[1:20:27] i don't believe that i believe she
[1:20:28] committed fornication because they've
[1:20:30] never been together
[1:20:37] we'll get to it wednesday right worth it
[1:20:41] joseph you're not to take unto thee mary
[1:20:47] thy girlfriend because she's committed
[1:20:49] fornication
[1:20:52] now that wasn't what it said
[1:20:54] you're not to take unto thee mary thy
[1:20:56] wife
[1:20:57] for that which is conceived in her is on
[1:20:59] the holy ghost
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:06] he said well brother dale i've heard a
[1:21:07] lot and i'm putting this on here for
[1:21:08] some reason maybe it's out there
[1:21:10] i brought this and i wasn't going to
[1:21:12] read the quote put it back put it up put
[1:21:14] it and put it back
[1:21:16] but i just want to read something
[1:21:19] that people use and then look what you
[1:21:21] do with it go ahead with number 10
[1:21:22] brother
[1:21:23] let's finish this up
[1:21:26] for some reason i keep coming back to it
[1:21:28] so i'm gonna put it on here
[1:21:30] maybe somebody here maybe somebody out
[1:21:32] in the world listening
[1:21:34] see a lot of people think that
[1:21:36] and it's true that fornication is before
[1:21:38] marriage and adultery is after marriage
[1:21:40] and that's exactly right
[1:21:45] all right
[1:21:47] but you've got to get it in the correct
[1:21:49] order
[1:21:52] brother bill what is the difference
[1:21:54] between four and this is uh paragraph
[1:21:56] 185 of questions and answers in 1959's
[1:22:01] 6 28 the evening service
[1:22:04] brother bill what is the difference
[1:22:05] between fornication adultery matthew 19
[1:22:07] 9
[1:22:09] jesus said in matthew 19 9 whosoever
[1:22:11] puts away his wife and marries another
[1:22:14] except it be for the cause of
[1:22:15] fornication committed adultery
[1:22:17] the difference between fornication and
[1:22:19] adultery
[1:22:21] the word could be applied either way
[1:22:25] now listen to it
[1:22:26] but to make it clear what he was talking
[1:22:28] about talking of there
[1:22:31] that a woman that's unmarried cannot
[1:22:33] commit adultery that's right
[1:22:36] well brett ryan said he committed
[1:22:37] adultery so she was married we'll get to
[1:22:39] this wednesday
[1:22:41] because she has no husband to commit
[1:22:43] adultery against
[1:22:48] what is if a woman does something wrong
[1:22:49] before they man it's unclean it's for
[1:22:51] her
[1:22:53] that's unclean is that fornication
[1:22:58] a woman is not married can't commit
[1:23:00] adultery right
[1:23:03] but we'll get into it if you just
[1:23:05] engaged
[1:23:07] you're married all right
[1:23:09] but listen
[1:23:11] she has to confess that to her husband
[1:23:14] before they're married
[1:23:17] if she did that if not and her husband
[1:23:19] finds it out later he has a right to put
[1:23:22] her away
[1:23:23] because
[1:23:24] she took a false foul
[1:23:28] eve was married to adam
[1:23:32] okay fornication is what a girl when she
[1:23:34] lives unclean that's fornication because
[1:23:37] she has no husband but when she's when
[1:23:40] she's married
[1:23:41] and then when she lives like that she's
[1:23:43] committed adultery against her husband
[1:23:45] all right
[1:23:49] he said it can be used either way
[1:23:52] the bible speaks of the old mother
[1:23:55] in revelation the catholic church and
[1:23:57] the things the harlots as being
[1:24:00] fornicators
[1:24:03] when it says they commit adultery with
[1:24:05] them
[1:24:07] we're going to get down into a good bit
[1:24:09] but the main thing i want you to think
[1:24:11] about
[1:24:16] eve was married
[1:24:19] that's why it's adultery
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:25] fornication is unclean living
[1:24:30] but it can be applied either way
[1:24:32] because adultery is what
[1:24:36] unclean living
[1:24:40] right
[1:24:43] see so the prophet's right when he said
[1:24:44] he'd be applied either way
[1:24:49] but you see eve committed adultery
[1:24:53] against her husband
[1:24:56] she disbelieved
[1:24:58] god's word
[1:25:05] and she took an act with the
[1:25:07] wrong person
[1:25:11] think on these things
[1:25:17] brother dale i've
[1:25:21] i've done this i've done that i've been
[1:25:23] wrong
[1:25:25] there's problems
[1:25:27] all right
[1:25:30] god can take care of a lot of problems
[1:25:33] if we let him
[1:25:35] but if we keep our own ideas
[1:25:37] and say bless god ain't nobody going to
[1:25:39] tell me i know what the prophet said
[1:25:43] hands up cross yourself
[1:25:48] why wouldn't you want to be free
[1:25:55] brother dale if i tell my husband he'll
[1:25:57] leave me
[1:26:01] you want me to get into that with the
[1:26:03] prophet
[1:26:04] he said you've already left god said
[1:26:06] he's left you
[1:26:11] as a sinner
[1:26:13] i said i wouldn't fool with a married
[1:26:14] woman it was just a it was a forbidden
[1:26:16] log to me
[1:26:19] i don't see why all boys and things went
[1:26:21] that way
[1:26:24] but i would not marry my wife until i
[1:26:26] told her my life
[1:26:29] she'll tell you that
[1:26:34] for why what reason
[1:26:36] i didn't know anything about the bible
[1:26:37] the message
[1:26:40] for some reason i would not marry her
[1:26:42] until i explained my life
[1:26:47] if it wasn't for just one reason i knew
[1:26:50] my family one day my brothers especially
[1:26:52] would come up and say sam i ain't the
[1:26:53] girl you used to be dating over there
[1:26:56] and i knew i'd have to explain it then
[1:27:00] it's always the best to get it out of
[1:27:01] the
[1:27:02] way tell her she could marry me if she
[1:27:05] wanted to then it wouldn't be none she
[1:27:06] could bring up later
[1:27:08] she always tell me i said honey the only
[1:27:10] problem you got is you're just too
[1:27:11] straight honest to tell everything
[1:27:13] why not
[1:27:17] why not
[1:27:21] why not be honest and straight that's
[1:27:24] right
[1:27:24] that's right
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:29] why not just be what we are
[1:27:31] and be christians
[1:27:35] solve a lot of problems
[1:27:38] they always say you want to do a wedding
[1:27:39] or anything remember the prophets are
[1:27:42] quoting where it says in the wedding
[1:27:44] vows you know
[1:27:45] see if any man have any reason
[1:27:48] it is too we should not be joined
[1:27:50] together let him speak now forever i
[1:27:51] hold her peace
[1:27:54] i had to use that one time because the
[1:27:55] brother came to me and he said brother
[1:27:57] dale so-and-so and so and so about a
[1:27:59] wedding
[1:28:00] i said did you know that before
[1:28:06] the wedding he said yes
[1:28:10] i said you shut up
[1:28:12] and don't you ever say anything to
[1:28:14] anybody
[1:28:16] because
[1:28:18] you
[1:28:19] were the one that was supposed to told
[1:28:20] me
[1:28:21] the blood's on you the bible says let
[1:28:24] him forever hold his peace and i meant
[1:28:28] it i said don't you ever say anything to
[1:28:30] anybody
[1:28:32] about that
[1:28:35] see this thing is not a play purdy
[1:28:39] if we'd have been serious about it down
[1:28:41] to our lives we wouldn't have so much in
[1:28:42] problems in our human lives
[1:28:47] but we tried to get around you know
[1:28:49] but maybe god didn't see that
[1:28:52] come on brothers
[1:28:54] what is the fall sin
[1:28:58] not drinking gambling smoking running
[1:28:59] around that's not sin that's attributes
[1:29:01] of unbelief you do that because you're
[1:29:03] an unbeliever
[1:29:05] if you believed you wouldn't do it
[1:29:08] well i've done it brother dale did you
[1:29:10] ask god to forgive you
[1:29:15] come on
[1:29:20] unbelief
[1:29:23] the only sin that there is
[1:29:30] he said well should we pray for
[1:29:31] so-and-so the bible says to pray for
[1:29:33] everybody
[1:29:34] except the ones that have been committed
[1:29:36] to the devil you don't pray for them
[1:29:38] anymore as specific about it
[1:29:41] but until then you pray
[1:29:45] why because
[1:29:46] what brought you out of where you are
[1:29:52] i never did do them things well
[1:29:54] then you ought to be able to sympathize
[1:29:56] with other people that did
[1:30:01] see then eve wasn't created wrong
[1:30:04] she was created perfect
[1:30:08] then by her reasoning
[1:30:10] she accepted satan's life
[1:30:14] and his lie was that she was there for
[1:30:16] that purpose
[1:30:19] that was the truth
[1:30:22] but it was the wrong way in the wrong
[1:30:24] person
[1:30:31] very easy to express
[1:30:34] when you know the truth
[1:30:38] and what i love it says you shall know
[1:30:40] the truth and the truth will set you
[1:30:41] free understand
[1:30:44] the only way we can know is true why
[1:30:45] wouldn't anybody want to know the truth
[1:30:48] i told one brother about a certain thing
[1:30:50] in the church one time i said if anybody
[1:30:52] in the world needs marriage and divorce
[1:30:54] priests here right here
[1:31:00] you realize why i preach it
[1:31:07] you realize that the fact that if i
[1:31:09] don't tell you the truth your blood is
[1:31:11] on me
[1:31:13] and you realize then
[1:31:15] that if i don't tell you the truth you
[1:31:17] can't get straight
[1:31:19] amen right
[1:31:21] and if you can't get straight me and
[1:31:23] you're both in trouble
[1:31:28] right
[1:31:30] see then i want to tell the truth
[1:31:35] because i'm as honest as i can be i
[1:31:37] don't believe
[1:31:38] anybody
[1:31:40] is going to be there at the change in
[1:31:42] the moment the twinkling of an eye i did
[1:31:44] not say
[1:31:46] nothing about the rapture
[1:31:48] the people that died down through there
[1:31:50] not knowing the truth
[1:31:52] will come forth as beautiful and perfect
[1:31:54] as we are
[1:31:55] right but when you get down to that
[1:31:57] chain that moment the twinkle of an eye
[1:31:59] you've got a different situation to
[1:32:00] stand on
[1:32:01] if you can't find a way to be free
[1:32:04] then i'm going by the grave if i can't
[1:32:06] find it
[1:32:10] that's as honest as i've ever been with
[1:32:12] anybody to try to tell you
[1:32:16] but we need to be free
[1:32:19] that's right
[1:32:20] to find out why we've done it it's one
[1:32:22] thing
[1:32:23] and find out it's still here
[1:32:28] still motivating us
[1:32:35] but the truth is that it's free oh my
[1:32:37] god number six in the red book
[1:32:40] number 60 in the red book anybody have a
[1:32:42] need
[1:32:51] anybody have a name
[1:32:57] i'm trying to get right here
[1:33:00] to have to wait dark
[1:33:18] divorce
[1:33:24] a revelation from marriage and divorce
[1:33:26] will never cross
[1:33:28] any other scripture
[1:33:34] right that's why did i stand and believe
[1:33:37] it
[1:33:40] the new birth
[1:33:45] the new birth
[1:33:49] sets us free
[1:33:52] marriage and divorce is a greater higher
[1:33:54] order
[1:33:56] invisible union
[1:33:58] the higher order
[1:34:01] than your birth
[1:34:14] gotta be dead
[1:34:30] anybody have a need
[1:35:08] blood pressure
[1:35:10] 180 something over 117 or something like
[1:35:12] that last night
[1:35:15] as i
[1:35:16] i believing that god can
[1:35:18] heal
[1:35:20] i believe he can take it away don't you
[1:35:23] don't you believe it i believe it
[1:35:26] but i want what she says she said i want
[1:35:28] to be right
[1:35:31] all right
[1:35:33] i believe that's what's going to take us
[1:35:34] to the chains don't you
[1:35:36] being right
[1:35:37] and believe it
[1:35:39] father
[1:35:40] just reach down and touch our sister
[1:35:42] about this whole blood pressure problem
[1:35:44] let it be taken away from her
[1:35:47] we know you did in mine lord years ago
[1:35:50] we believe you
[1:35:52] same god had touched me the same wanted
[1:35:54] to touch our sister
[1:35:55] to set her free
[1:35:57] and we believed it and her desire in her
[1:35:59] heart is to be right with you
[1:36:01] and move on with you
[1:36:03] but we believe you father and we thank
[1:36:05] you
