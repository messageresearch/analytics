========================================

man and amen and amen I want to see him don't you could just be in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Romans and uh let's see I lost my scripture I'll get it right in a second try to get them in place when they come out here it's all right just remember a bible study this coming Saturday six o'clock come and be with us we have a good time sitting around eating popcorn talking about the word of the Lord just kind of an informal doings and fellowship and if you need a place to spend the night we don't have to go back to Atlanta come and let us know you can stay with some of us and we'll have some time to Fellowship onto that Remember The Minister's meeting will be at brother Bill yountz and we will receive I guess we could do it today next Sunday we will receive an offer and we'll announce it next Sunday we will receive a special offering for brother bill yountz to help him because he's been out of work now for quite a while and being the stroke and things of the problems and also just remember that and uh we will send him a little money or waiting him can take it to him because they're having to ministers meet and then the fellowship meeting will be at brother Longoria's on the third Saturday if any of you are wanting to go along with us let us know and and we'll try to make arrangements to to take it on back you know it's the best thing we can do and even feed your meals on the way because we always do well you know we we don't let you go there hungry they feed you but we always give you something deep on the way there and stop somewhere and eat and also you won't be hungry but just come and be with us we'll try to do the best we can on taking doing it all right now I've lost my scripture but I don't worry about it I won't use it uh we'll bypass because I look put I put first Timothy 1 17 and I don't it ain't even what I wanted I'm doing pretty good now Jimmy got everything so because I could use that one but I don't want it I'll get it later in the next message because it'll it'll do it but we'll just read Romans 8 28-31 okay father we thank you for this day in your love unto us we thank you for grace and Calvary thank you for salvation thank you for being you and we pray now that you would just bless us and come Among Us Lord to speak to us you've sung to us we sung to you and you've worshiped we've had a good time in doing that prayed and and all Lord and talking about you now it's time to sit down and listen to the word so we ask you to open our eyes that we may see truly who you are and what you're doing we love you and we thank you forgive our sins guide us in Jesus name amen Romans 8. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for doing whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did notice you're going you know I keep saying this where you'll remember it you're going to this moreover verse 30 starts it's already done man all right see moreover whom he did predestinate that's done done he also called Already Done in whom he called them he also Justified already done in whom he justified them he also glorified it's all done in him now it's not done in me and you that's the difference in it but right all right said what's then what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us you may be seated Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word that undropped it I'll pick it up in a minute and the message I generally try to get everything so perfectly in line and and one time I might goof and leave the script and I put down first Timothy 1 17 but that's not the one I wanted all right I'll get to it in a minute it'll be in the message but now remember what we're trying to talk about how does God predestinate he predestinates by his foreknowledge because you've got to go to foreknowledge first then you go to predestination you don't go to predestination first because you're you're missing the point you're you're getting it that would be a predetermined Factor but by foreknowledge he can predestinate what will happen and do and can write it down to me the Bible was written before the world ever begun I don't have any trouble with that uh you know the whole Bible as far as God was concerned he was was done back there because he said infinite he's not like me and you that has to think things over and change your mind you know and do up and down what he once says is finished now that's what about having a mind like that but now you forgive me I try to explain something I believe that The Closer we're coming to the true understanding of God's word I believe we're coming to the mind of God you said well I was born with a mind of God that's true but we were born with babies babies mind of God that's the best way to say it because why would you need the statue of perfect man growth development if you were had everything to start with all right well see I believe that we're coming to a place now until we can talk about some of the things that we're speaking of in that way we can get a better understanding because we can we can tie together a lot the prophet has said and it won't be confusing and and then we will have a better understanding of God's word but now remember what this morning the one thing I want you to hold over to remember the prophet said if we don't stay with the same simple gospel said we will work our way away from the truth well now that's salvation one God word of baptism no eternal hell all of those things are the same simple Doctrine in other words what he taught up to that place he's talking during the seal book right see then we just want the great big things to look out and see what this is and that is no I want the Simplicity of the Gospel the word that I can walk upon what I believe you know and it'll hold me and like I've always said if the disciples had eternal life you know as everybody said well you come with eternal life whether the disciples had it why was they scared to death right right they scared to death in that Upper Room they weren't coming out of there until the Holy Ghost fell but when the Holy Ghost fail it was clear to nothing change the whole situation didn't it all right see that's the way we are when you know where you stand you don't have to worry about them right you're just going down the line believing it and don't worry about what's going but now we've tried to explain this morning about the fact of us being part of God and I know that's a it's a word that's been used the prophets words were there uh we talked about it but sometimes in the human element we have troubles comprehending very simple words part of God well see we want to we make that as being something he made right and talk about a part of I I have no thoughts whatsoever of talking about the children of God as being something that God made no I know maybe the wording is is different from maybe sometimes the way we hurt things and things but think about it just think if there is just God and he's eternal and that God has offspring children not only now all of us by natural creation are the children of God everybody in the world is a child of God by creation you understand that you know it don't matter who it is God had to give the life there's no way it doesn't matter uh what you do with all the other every person the prophet said that come into the world is a child of God why because God created us all right but now I'm back talking now about in eternity were that God dwelt Alone he was self-existing so then we couldn't be back there his people her ideas or thoughts we could only be there as an attribute that was in him as I said this morning then we talk about being there as in his mind well Judas was in his mind but see Judas proved who he was in what he done you know what we prove Who We Are we prove who we are what we do all right then in being that I'm talking about the children of God not children of God the way we talk about children of God we've talked about children of God that we become children of God you know well what are you talking about we received the new birth and it makes us a child of God but did we have a beginning does that eternal life that you received in your new birth did it ever have a beginning anywhere no it was a time we didn't have it right there is my whole key right the time we didn't have that and by the new birth it was transmitted to us and see that another way God he could dwell alone self-existing and yet he could have within him the attributes to be a savior A Healer a father a son and none of that in existence in any form other than within him is that hard to comprehend I know sometimes words we use and thoughts maybe that we hadn't thought of or are strange and we have to consider them a little while but see that's the way I believe God I believe Jesus was God made manifest according to the scriptures in flesh then being that God he's not a second person he's the person I looked that up one ago it's on Daniel 70 weeks paragraph 110 of the the part called six-fold purpose he's not as a second person or anything he's the person right and being that then God never had a time did he begin now the word God had a time that it began because it would be developed into being by worship God meaning an object of worship but it was the same Eternal God go back to the questions and answers in Genesis and listen to the prophet his explains he said the creation of the world a different thing he said like a child playing before the father's nowhere and said then he says let there be what who was speaking was that a son was that another person or was that God in another form called a son a lot of difference in it right see then Jesus Christ dwelling on the Earth was God in another form now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Bride of Jesus Christ is God in another form amen called a bride that to me is simple sure I admit there was a time that was very very confusing but yet you just keep thinking about it as he was the Bible says so are we in this world so here he was in mortal flesh Soul and Spirit almighty God flesh being a creation at a beginning that flesh had to be made Eternal in the resurrection all right you and I lost doomed and on the way to hell amen God came down by the new birth which I firmly believe in justification sanctification of baptism of the Holy Ghost not just walk up the altar shake the preacher's hand and say I believe the message don't do that with me I might tell you the devil does it too I'm sorry I might just do that because I don't want to hinder your faith but I don't want you just based on some thought of your mind see I believe you buy the new birth have eternal life and if that's true if that's true that you have eternal life then that eternal life never had a beginning so it always was eternal so the prophet's right when he says you always was eternal he's right but he's not talking about this body we have no sense to look at that know it right um see he's speaking in the terms of understanding the truth of the word of God and see then by doing that see he's he's bringing it down to showing us who we are he says we're little Messiahs he says we're little gods you know we are as the scripture says that the word comes to the sons of God we know how it comes right we're not no problem the word come by the way of the prophet as I said the other day you say well you don't you mean it can't come to me I agree with you can't come to you can't come to me he came to the prophet all right we want everybody now trying to correct him yeah see because they think the words come into them we'll get to it in a minute where brother random mentions the Catholics and he says talk about eternal sonship he said and the other churches we know the Catholics are the one that believes in eternal sonship the Baptist Doctrine is eternal sonship co-equal co-eternal right God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost and no scripture whatsoever for it that's right he said and the other churches all right let me say it like this you know the Catholics and the other churches like Lula they believe in eternal sonship blessed God I don't believe in it well I want you to explain it then because the only explanations I've ever heard of explaining Eternal sonship is always dealt with Jesus Christ I've never heard anybody in this message if you have I'm sorry and you know you tell me later but I've never heard anybody explain Eternal sonship in relation to the church have you I'm talking about in relation to us as a church we see then that's making us a second person and we we fight the quote of a lot of people that I'm a son of Jesus that was the son of God we say that was wrong you know and I agree but if you don't believe who you are then how are you going to have it straight we won't get to this because we're going to go over so far and then drop back and go back down so hang on to it the prophet of God said you never became a son of God by the new birth just believe that he said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God or the but it's the word or seed a lot of things brother random said see that we need to get them together and and think about it and and it's not just saying that brother Dale's a teacher no I'm just what I am but you see these brothers out running on the field and they're not going to tell you everything brother Brown and said they're just going to quote what you want to hear yeah yeah and what they want to use and what makes you feel good oh you always was eternal you always wasn't I've got the quotes for the prophet well amen but if you always was eternal how did you become Eternal all right got a question how did you become eternal well you don't hear him preaching about the new birth they're preaching it's just a doing away with the old thoughts and coming forth with a new thoughts and being just right missing the whole truth go ahead brother Anderson and pull up Romans eight that's not the one I was looking for a while ago but Romans 8. I want to keep on that we was this morning Roman 8 uh 14 or 8 15 we'll start we're talking about heirs and join ours the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children in heirs Heirs of God so whatever he has we have and in our day in terminologies now what's the point and our day and thoughts to get an inheritance means death of the one who has the property the material money whatever you want to call it right and see people say you know people will say well my God didn't die well who died on Calvary was that Jesus that died on Calvary sure but what happened there he within himself in the flesh could not give us anything that's why it starts off that we're Heirs of God we receive eternal life from God because he's the only one that had eternal life the flesh man Jesus didn't have eternal life him dying on a cross was an ability right to release the life that the life could come back on you and I and bring our inheritance to us which what is our inheritance the world who cares The Inheritance we need is sonship we use that word Loosely see we need children of God we need to be The Offspring of God not just Sons and Daughters of Jesus that was the son of God either Jesus was almighty God and we really are messed up see God dwelt in that flesh amen and death pulled that life out of him whose life God's life so that's why it says then in children and if children and The Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ now I've always believed this I don't believe when we get to heaven I mean it's just coming in the message I don't believe we're going to go up to heaven and we're going to see Jesus here and we're going to look over here in our little Halo we're gonna look over here and see another form or something I just since I saw one God I've never believed that I believe one day we will see Jesus and know who he is we'll know that he is father son Holy Ghost everything but only his children only his offspring I may not have it in here I got laid on the desk see only those who are predestinated can see the truth of one God there's people that would be given eternal life and to watch on judgment right you have your field sealed you let's give an eternal life you have your 144 000. that's given eternal life but none of them were the bride of Christ none of them are his offspring you agree see that if they're not his offspring his offspring is a special point but what is it it's a special designation of himself so what I was saying this morning now I believe that back before the world self-existing when he dwelt totally alone not a matter of molecule or anything that he had attributes and those attributes were his children now his children as I said this morning is not like our children the best we can do is our children all right but no see his children are the same as he is right and he was God made manifest in a human vessel right then we are to be God made manifest part of God because why because none of us can be the fullness but it takes all of us together to be the fullness as I was quoting this morning the prophet said God he is not complete without you but you mean God needs me now you don't need any of us get that out of your mind he don't need you at all right it's a wonderful glorious pleasure to realize and find out who you are right and then he can use you right he don't need us we need him but when we realize who we are and what we're doing here you realize you and I are to face Satan as no other age has ever faced him somebody's going to walk off this Earth without dying right you agree right well that means somebody's going to realize who they are now get out of that cobweb things in our brains it keeps running us back to thoughts and you know well mama said you know you know we're not God now son we're a son of God well that was good in Mama's Day she had a good point now we ought to understand it a Son of God is God made manifest in another form that's the Simplicity to me to the godhead because if the God is not complete without you then we certainly not run into a Oneness Doctrine remember the one that's doctor and one like your finger they believe that Jesus was the last form of God I don't believe that I believe you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth in you is the last form of God to the Gentiles then he goes to the Jews and he goes to the white throne he has many more ways of manifesting itself when I believe the bride of Christ is the last form of God in morphe change his form into another form he's not here now in Corporal body he's in you and I that's why he can't step back on Earth you don't you don't think like that why would it be that he can't come back to earth because he came back to Earth he'd be in the body and we'd be in a body so it'd mess it all up but by the time we meet him in the air we're going to be as he is which is eternal then we can Fellowship together think about it your simple points see we how we are a part of God by the eternal life that we have in our soul by the new birth that new birth makes us a child of God or if you want to call it a son of God there's no problem with it the prophet could call him Jesus the son of God but he never called him God the son you know he called him Son of God the Bible called him Son of God but not God the son because that's the second person I don't believe in that notice now we say we don't believe in eternal sonship what do we mean then we only talking about Jesus Christ are we just talking about that he was not an eternal son why would you want to be an eternal son see you're separating yourself from the real truth of the understanding of the word of God to be the children of God is not to be another person to be the children of God is to be the children of God a part of God and he didn't make us and put us over here right ah I don't look around at my kids and say well I tell you what you better behave yourself because I made you and I can I can take you out of existence maybe I needed to whoop them a little bit but you know I never wanted to take them out of existence why because they're part of me all right but you know what they're just apart they're part of the mother too you can run the DNA of the mother all the way back as much as you can run the father back we just lay upon the father line because of the the ego I guess the men have but to think we're something well you know what God was able to get Jesus Christ here without Joseph and Mary right he could have put him on a rock and done the same thing but it would not Abate him Akin folks so he didn't choose to do it that way he could have spoke him into existence he had done that many times when he went down to the the three you know going to Abraham and two going on to Sodom he had spoke bodies into existence that had done that but it wouldn't have been kin folks so you would not know dealing of calling us joint heirs he join ours to me means that I've got you so much as you got that's joined you know all right you got 51 and I got 49 that's not join ours means the same amen now how did he I wrote my thought here to hold it until we could break them down how how did Jesus get anything I said Jesus well I'm in it the man flesh how did the flesh man get anything first off God was in the flesh second off what was in him changed his body right well it's not that to What's Happening Now by the new birth God is living in us and he's going to change these bodies we just won't be the fullness of the godhead as one person but all together around the world we make up the bride of Christ his children and see if you get the scripture then you can can depend on things and do it where the Bible said back there you'll be with your offspring and God quickened that to me one day and he said your children will be there they're sitting here the grandkids is on the way and the great grandkids is on the way you see I have no problems with claiming uh you know like you'd say well now let me get this right oh Terence was getting the life out of everything so we use him to talk huh okay now he's my son he said well God told you your children will be saved see now here's your narrow-minded I believe Terence married the girl he's supposed to marry I believe Wade married a girl he was supposed to marry I believe I ain't a married divorce he's supposed to marry I believe that and you know what I believe that makes them one right right well when he said I'd be there with my Offspring you mean I'm going to leave my daughter-in-laws or son-in-laws out of it I don't believe it that way I claim them all and one by one they're going to come you just keep doing it just don't quit when everything gets to go in the worst is when you believe the most right and everything looked like it's totally gone there's no hopes right at the ends when you start saying I believe do you notice I used to tell her I said every time I look at wait I laugh at him not life and because it was wrong with life I just know that he's going through a hard Road but he's coming why because he's your child no come on no but because I as a child of God claim my children why can't you do that with yours yeah but mine's out there in the world of love you used to be lost somebody claimed you come on another run said some old great grandmother back down through there prayed for you I don't charge you on that part I just leave it okay yeah but I thought that we were supposed to believe the prophet I thought the prophet said that God would hear his child more than he would hear an angel you remember them quotes more than he'd hear an angel and see he never sent an angel down to die right and he never sent her son to die he came himself I can show you what the prophet said he said one day he said that's too big of a job I'm going myself that's just so expression right or showing you emphasizing the the fact that what he believed about he said I'm not going to send us I'm going myself too big of a job see he hasn't chosen us for this no purpose whatsoever he has chosen you and I to end this whole thing up I'm gonna quit writing notes I don't get to follow him anymore but listen Church God has saved the best to last you want to know anything about what I believe about God but he has not went to heaven to stay up there he's down here I love it when the prophet said that one day he said even though he knew the end from the beginning even though he could see Israel and all her he said he didn't go up to heaven and sit down did he come down to live it with him you want some more quotes he said that God one day said I'm going to go down to Sodom to make sure that things that I've heard are right now he's infinite God he knew everything about Sodom right but yet he said I'm going down I think he's still here what you're looking at just gonna get the ride to go off of this Earth because of the vessel it's in we'll get to that when we talk about the seed they come predestinated eternally we're getting over a little bit and then we'll start going back down through and come over back into time with it what I'm talking about now let me get on to the thought we're talking about the children of God not as secondary persons because children would go of God would imply now listen to what I'm saying I'll quote the rest of that in a second to be children of God in our human terminologies means we've got to have a mom and a daddy right right that's sensible requirement right daddy can't do it by itself right you'll see one of these days we ain't let Eve come in the garden I believe Eve was going to speak the word you should have just stayed with it Adam did not just speak it all the time he could have took care of it she just goofed up by getting her own intelligence in the way God is waiting on the bride to realize who she is what she's doing here where he can pour into her his revelation and I stated again like in the days of Martin Luther how many times did Martin Luther preach on the just you live by faith may have done great teachings on it because it's what he was see but one day it was quickened unto him he said you just shall live by faith he tackled the world and overcome the world with that because it's something real what do you think is going to help us keep us I mean what do you think is keeping us from walking off of here we don't have it the way we need it right and until we get it we'll keep on hammering it out until somebody says that's it right there and then what it is it'll take place well see because we are not a second person we are God made manifest upon the Earth a part of God I wish I could open up our heads and pour that into us to where we could see it but listen to what he said let's go back and I'll try to get in the notes go ahead we're number one brother let's talk about this eternal sonship I want this quote First into your mind taking officers we would see Jesus 1961 or 09 paragraph e or E8 and only anything that had a beginning has an end and only anything that had as a beginning as an end it's just those things which do did not begin has no end that's Eternal eternity has neither beginning or end and the only way that we can have eternal life is receive part of him in US now is that enough he said that's the only way yeah but I got it figured out we come this way and we can see now you're facing the prophet he said that's the only way you have a brother so-and-so made it's so beautiful now that they had this light and I remember one of them had this big old light up here and then he brought the light over and he brought it down this way and then he'd bring it over and I thought it looks beautiful but I thought a minute I thought that ain't right see something inside of me just said that ain't right you know why because he took all of this and he put it over here he left nothing here but everybody shouted about the Beautiful illustrations do you realize a quote right around and said is going to kill you if you can't get it right all God was he poured into Christ you remember that one and all Christ he poured into the church well I know you don't think it's carnal as I do but try it on let's try it a little bit every once in a while to be carnal instead of being so Holy Ghost revelated until everything is spiritual oh God was he poured into Christ you have no God anymore you got Christ all Christ poured in the church you don't know Christ anymore you have a church you don't realize what you've just done you totally done away with God and you left the people I'm not talking about something like that now the man would have had a beautiful picture if he'd draw it and left his Halo and he said now that Halo came over here and down here to begin to create Etc but never took nothing away from here you realize when that the prophet explained in question and answered Jesus that the sun went out he said not like an arm going off he's trying to explain it there was just as much of God here as it was over here come on have you done goofing it up do you take that God and you put it take the quote all God was he poured into Christ you don't do away with God he's still sitting right here looking he poured into Christ the son right you take all that and you pour it into church and you do away with nothing it increases God is expanding expanding himself brother won't preach that 1971. God expanding himself every time a child is born into the body is expanding God see we want to make a beautiful picture out of it though Brothers at my house one day and he said something I said my Lord man he went to God got drawn out he ain't even right it's a beautiful picture I can make you a beautiful picture they don't make it right he just going by a beautiful picture okay and the only way that we can have eternal life is receive part of him in US and that makes us sons and daughters what with God's life in US then we have eternal life as we are Sons and Daughters of God therefore we're Eternal with God when we receive eternal life there's only one way to do it how do you get eternal life that's to be born of this Holy Spirit the only way we can have eternal life is to be born of his spirit how can it feel like it I just feel like I always was it got to do with feelings what does the word of God say all right so I give you that to where we you won't I keep interlacing thoughts about our our quotes about that we must be born again to keep you from from settling down on a thought of trying to get it to try to make us something they were not the Bible said it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves so whatever we are God made us why not just have a good time you know I I pray to God and I've been around Prior Warriors I'm just not one I've never been one I'm sorry now your people make so beautiful prayers you know you know they seem like the Heavenly anthems opened up and all I can do is say Lord you know I'm sorry I ain't done too good today you know I let things get in my way I got upset I got this I got that I got problems I got troubles and I say well Lord would you help me when I have the kids they don't come over to the house Daddy I'd like to talk to you a little while you know we are your children and we're I say what do you want that's what I'd say right but they don't do it that way because that's not the way to approach it they just go to the house and say we need so and so I said go get it my kids has got a key to my house everything I got they got a key to it they come in the house get what they want they don't have to write down what they got well because they're my children I want them to be that away I want them to be the whether they can be at home me you know the old thing I never did see very much of it but was it called Dallas on a woman that called something 40 back to them you know South Fork or something south Florida you know they all live in that big old house you know and you know that's what I do with my kids if I'd had a house big enough of course I'd want them a private door where they could go out and I'd want a private door where I could go out but I'd love to handle just everyone in the same house we do that anyway it's no problem talking about the children of God all right let's get on the Eternal sonship let's talk about it a minute I'll try to get through in a hurry I've got communion go to number two which is revelation of Jesus Christ verse 1960 1205 in the morning service and look what he says about eternal sonship I want to ask you some of you precious Catholic people who call that the Eternal sonship of God God Eternal ship of Jesus Christ with God how can you say such a word I'm a dummy with a seventh grade education but I know better than that the word son has to have a beginning so how can he be Eternal and be a son eternity has no beginning or end so he can't be a son an eternal son he can't be all right now remember the point of what I'm getting at I spent this morning and half of the day whatever he is we're join ours when you're explaining him you're explaining us that's the way he done it not about what I decided to do look he can't be a son and he's an eternal son and then have a beginning because there's no such a thing as an eternal son my son had a beginning so he can't be Eternal you see he is the Eternal God not the Eternal son he says Glory Almighty Jehovah come down and made manifest and dwelt with us look what he says he is the Eternal God not the Eternal son why because he is God what are we supposed to be go to the next one this is questions and answers Hebrews part two paragraph 3385. or as I have went through it the Catholic call it the Eternal sonship of God which is I have said before the word doesn't even make sense see there cannot be an eternal son because a son had to have a beginning so now you can't but he can't be you can't be an eternal son come on and so Jesus had a beginning God had no beginning see but the son now he's explaining what he was how did it could come to pipe but the son was not Eternal Eternal Sunshine but the son that was with the father in the beginning was the logos that went out of God now what was we explaining the logos that went out of God the word the speech that was God in another form not another God and it was the theophany that went out the human form that didn't have eyes like you see the better eye didn't have the ears like it here but a far more hearing see it was a theophany that with all this rainbow condescended into theophany Moses saw it when it passed through the rock like that he saw the back Parts said it looked like a man even the scholars go if you've got a Scofield bible go back and read Genesis and you'll see it talking about logos God Etc and then when it talks about the creation you'll see him using the word Sun because it was a word see they know that much about it but how much do we know about it look at the next one this is Christ is revealed in his own word 65 822 paragraph 53 54. my son is the Catholic Church puts it Eternal son and all the rest of the churches the word don't even make sense so evidently now all the churches believe in eternal sonship now you're going to argue the quote with him go ahead see there cannot be any turn be Eternal and be there and be a son because the sun is something that's begotten from and the word Eternal it cannot be any he can be a son but he cannot be an eternal son no sir it cannot be an eternal son but now he is the son so much now he's explaining what it is that all the word that was in Jeremiah and Moses all them they spoke of me that's why he's a son that's why he was called a son that's the reason he was called son reason he refers father why it's just as simple as you can just let God pour it to you pour it into you all right God revealed in a body of Flesh notice reveal from flesh are from word unto flesh that's what he was God was revealed in flesh we call that a son so evidently everybody believes eternal sonship he said all the other churches go ahead let me read fast who is God 1906 or 50. I go backers and fourth word I'll go from 65 to 50 to 47 to see that he's holding the same thought back here as he's holding over here that's where everybody thinks he had this thought over here and then he changed his thought over there right well he learned better after the third pool and I agree that there was things open after the third book but it's like Wade said when we were facing some people about it and the people were saying we'll take what he said after the word and you know the sword in the hand all right we'll go back and read The Sword in the hand was out in Sabina Canyon or whatever and he come back to Jeffersonville under that anointing it was fixed the priest the white horse rider wrong on the first seal sure you hadn't heard that doctor in that long and that's 40 years that's 50 almost 50 years ago and he was right over here so far the message then he was wrong and the son of man come down and straightened him out well I'd like to know where he straightened him out because he was born to prophet and they're that great space for that no no one can fathom it in their mind beyond that that space eternity it's Jehovah God out there and we're taught in the beginning that the logars or the Son of God went out of God now I do not believe in eternal sonship he's always getting us away from believing what he's telling us that he called him a son but don't believe in eternal sonship okay that's even radical to even think even mentioned such a thing eternal sonship how he had a Eternal substances they're saying he had an eternal wait it's even it's even Eternal sonship how could he be a son he had to have a beginning see all right look at your neck number six Revelation Jesus Christ page 21 Church age book people talk about Jesus being the Eternal Son of God now he isn't that a contradiction whoever heard of a son being Eternal sons have Beginnings with that which is eternal never had a beginning he is the Eternal god Jehovah manifested in the flesh so is it today he's the same Eternal Jehovah God manifested in flesh right if we just realize it look at the next one wisdom versus Faith 62 401. Burger of 87-88 and here's a little thought that you everything that had a beginning had an ending but it's the things that did not have a beginning that doesn't end the only thing that's eternal therefore I'd like to ask the question how could we ever make sense out of the word of the Eternal sonship of God if he was a son he had a beginning if he was eternal son how could he be a son and be eternal her son is is a product of something but if he was he was could not be an eternal son there's no such a thing Eternal sonship of God there's no Son of God all right there's no such thing as an eternal Son of God God If he if he ever had a beginning he cannot be nothing but Eternal no I don't but if he was a son he had a beginning so he cannot be an eternal son it was the Eternal God manifested in a son well it's it's in the Sun uh-huh see Eternal God because God is the only thing that's Eternal I'm wanting to get down to one more that I got in here so hold on a second let me see if I can cuddle no we don't want to cut too much go to number nine because I want you to listen to the thought going to number nine which is thirsting for life 57 6 30. the book called The Facts of our faith and they use the word of Eternal sonship of God the word don't even make sense to me the word Eternal means eternity which had no beginning or has no end and the son means at a beginning so how could it what it could be a eternal godship you can have an eternal godship but not an eternal sonship a lot of difference what is eternal godship God living in many vessels eternal godship but never Eternal sonship a son is one that had a beginning what's what he's explained what it is and the low Gods which was the son of God went out created by these great Fountains of Purity God is those Spirits went out and it created the logos and it was a body he goes on to explain it it was a theophany of what it was doing but do you get what he's saying it could be an eternal godship but not an eternal sonship all right let's get the next one which is Hebrews chapter 5 and 6. be number 10. progress 64 is where we're going to he didn't have three people up there and sent one of them his son he didn't do that it was God himself come down in the form of a son because what are you going to call like I said this morning or when it was the three Hebrew children down in the fiery furnace and that never could have to look down in there and he seen these people being taken care of and not being hurt in a fiery furnace that killed the people that throwed them in seven times harder than it ever been to help he did before what would you call it didn't we throw in three yeah well there's four in there and one of them is like the Son of God if I could see the movement I've got to put a sonship apart connecting you know if you can see something visible all right you put a sonship form of the word all right but then you realize if he's taking care of the rest of him he's got to be God so he said he's locking to the son of God and look it was God himself came in the form of son son at the beginning and then Sunday a son has a beginning and the son that had a beginning and some of you you're Catholic people I got your book facts of our faith said the Eternal sonship of God how are you going to express that word how are you going to make it how sense how can it be Eternal that's not the Bible that's your book Eternal citizenship they don't that word is not right or anything that's the son had a beginning an eternal has no beginning so it isn't Eternal sonship Christ become God the Flesh and dwelt Among Us he had a beginning wasn't no Eternal sonship it's the Eternal godhead not sonship now think on that an eternal godship not an eternal son not an eternal sonship an eternal godhead that's the way I believe the way I do Father Son and Holy Ghost makes the godhead right amen right now is that that the godhead that was the scripture I was going to use that part of doing showing it but anyhow Father Son and Holy Ghost is the godhead you take out any part of that and you know how the godhead complete so you take us out of it you don't have the godhead to complete God we're his offspring see that's what I believe about an eternal God Eternal sonship and watch and I know the scripture I preached on it many years so don't worry I'll get to it in a second but the Bible said that God made me all in all you know there'll be a time when the sonship won't be in existence but will it be destroyed no won't be destroyed that's what we think see we think up here all this was great big thing and then it come down here and just leave a vacuum up here when we get dire folks and we see Jesus the Bible to be fulfilled where he said if you've seen me you've seen the father we won't be looking at a father son the Holy Ghost under a trinity Doctrine we will see Jesus Christ and know that he's almighty God he will be Father Son and Holy Ghost still standing right there you never do away with anything in God now come on that's one of the things that will keep a key that will help you anything God ever had he'll always have anything's a part of him that's why the hell's not eternal it's not a part of God that's why Sinners not Eternal it's not a part of God it will be annihilated is not a part of God but anything's a part of him will never be done away with him show me something that's done away in God that's why I believe in all the gifts I'm leaving all the things the Bible the nine spiritual gifts and all of that I believe in every one of them and see the prophet said we're going to have to answer for the gifts not working in this church let me tell you one thing about it this boy's never stopped him but don't you worry about it we can put it in order we got the word we put it in order if it comes out wrong we just get them tell you it's wrong well now you got the Holy Ghost you're gonna get mad at me cause I told you you're wrong come on if you get mad at me for telling you you're wrong you don't have the Holy Ghost now you might have problems with what I say but you can't argue about it why because you prove you're lost that's where people don't understand me I don't have any problems were you telling me brother Dale I don't agree with you that don't bother me but don't go tell everybody else you don't agree tell me then go tell them put in the newspaper the next day but come to me first because it might be something you and I are misunderstanding not going to the man the other day about something he said I just don't agree on I said brother it's it's you don't understand I'm trying to say the same thing you're saying I'm just using other words I said I'm not different will you I agree with you but it's just the way I see it the way I express it you know because I believe if you've got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to keep you straight but don't thank your feelings can't be heard because it can remember your feelings is on the outside we're in the spirit and the thing somebody tells you the truth it's only about the flesh but it's Amen for the inside of the hand right that's the difference in it you mean you'd get mad at me brother Marlo with me telling you the truth and I'll save your soul you might not like what I say in my terminologies you're not going to get upset with me why because you don't know the truth is the truth you might tell us I wish you'd said it some other time or a little kinder well that may be true the church I'm trying to tell you about God and his ways and doing but to express it to you to see yourself well the Lord will in the next message I may take some more and if not then we're going to start coming back this way toward time but we got a lot to preach before we can get into time we've got God's foreknowledge in his predestination and the writing of The Book of Life we got the morning Stars saying together and the sons of God shouted for joy we got all of those things to deal with before we can get back down to earth but my whole point is one thing we are the children of God and if children then we're Heirs of God because that's the way we become the children of God Is by receiving his eternal life and we're join ours with Jesus Christ that that logos that came out to come down see to do you or not or join ours with it if he had a right to speak the words you've got to write to speak the word that's where we're living below our privileges as the bride of Christ I know what it is folks I live in this human vessel and I start something starts coming and when it does the devil will come and I said but look what you've done look what you've done look what you've done yesterday look what you've done here look what you said look what right that's right come on am I hitting you something gets you on your shoulder and I'll tell you you ain't worthy of speaking the best thing to do is say Satan you're right uh ain't worthy but my daddy told me to ask amen he didn't tell me how good I was that he'd answer me if one of my kids went out and murdered and done everything in the world you know I would never reject them as my children they would still be my children well because they're my children I'd love them and everything else and try to help them in any way but you understand what I'm saying whatever Jesus Christ has or Christ is the Bible called it so Christ was able to create the world is that the scripture does the bible say that all things were created by Jesus Christ and without him there was not anything made that was made and when he came here on Earth he proved that he was one it was back there that said let there be he stood right here on Earth and said hey even before they'd rece received the new birth he said I knew you before the foundation of the world that's what he says about the disciples now don't go try to find that in the scripture on a lot of you got to give up but go to brother random and let him explain it he said Jesus said he knew them before the foundation of the world and I had Glory with you we don't remember it right why because we were only attributes the disciples don't remember it they were only attributes he wasn't having fellowship with them as a uh God in a a sinner it was when we was in God and then a part of God and the only part of God is the eternal life not people get this thing out of the way this is the garbage can we're trying to get redeemed well I just feel like I was back there brother Dale sometimes when you're preaching I just feel like I was back there I don't feel like I'm back there I know it was if I have eternal life today I know I was back there why because that's eternal life that I'm talking about not me not as a person you know what the prophet said your name was written there he said I'm paraphrasing the quote now because I have to get it he said not necessarily your name now your mind name may not be Donnie it may not be Anderson we have trouble with his anyway getting that maroon gone we don't make fun of people about their names it's just that we try to pronounce them sometimes we can't get it and I can't remember whether they're from Kenya or North Africa or South Africa or New Mexico I can't keep up with it I don't try to get that all in my mind I'm sorry I just try to be what I am but listen see the next message you'll see is we'll start coming back this way now I mean dropping it back into time because if you can see that before the world ever begun that you're a part of God you don't have no trouble with him predestinating but by foreknowledge he's got to get that flesh here you got a deal on four knowledge get that old flesh we're looking at don't deal with predestination about that old flesh deal before knowledge because how are you going to have in the morning start staying together and the sons of God shouted for joy you know one of the prophets said they'd done that he said because they seen the Plan of Redemption we way back there looking at the planet and how the Plan of Redemption didn't come into view until we start back this away you got to get Adam into the garden first and then you can talk about the Plan of Redemption because Adam in the garden didn't need Redemption right he wasn't a sinner he was perfect then you start dealing with those things let's stand together we got communion anybody has a need we just open up and say if you have a need just coming unless pray about it and believe it then we'll go into the communion anybody have a need before we go into communion with my children okay well let's believe that God will take care of it amen father we commit into your hands what our brother is talking about Lord Jesus he wants you to work out all of his problems so that's a good thing to do just take them give them to you Lord and father we love you didn't we We Just Praise Your Great Name we ask you now to bless our brother and just be with him and let everything work for your honor and Glory in Jesus name anybody else before we go into communion you know we'd just be like what the things that we've heard from the prophet are from the world and the people you know The Story Goes that there was a a man that he hired a bookkeeper you've heard the story to do all of his book work and handle everything and one day the guy came in and he said late in the evening he said your bankrupt said you're done you're broke you don't have any money everything's new and said what you're going to do he said I'm going to bed you're going to bed when I told you everything's messed up said yep that's what I hired you for yeah Corner way of saying it but you know we have a lot of problems and troubles and all that we just don't give them to God you know he's the problem solver we're the one who created them and we try to straighten them out we just keep creating them so the best thing to do just give them to him go to bed I tell you how I go to sleep at night we pray me and my wife we pray there in the bedroom you know and we get down and we pray and and then I just turn over to bed and I said well Lord I'm not going to do anything else this evening there's anything else you can make me think of and I need to go do I'll try to run do it in a hurry but if not I'll see you in the morning well well I said before the room gets dark I'm asleep well it's a good way you know when I can't sleep when I'm worried about my problems you want to try to tell her she gets worried about everything she builds a house she's got everything built in her mind before she ever even before we even bought the property I said honey that's not the way to do just lay down and say Lord when we get to our it'll take care of it until then you take care of it because I can't solve it you'll go to sleep a whole lot quicker than you will trying to figure everything out all right let's read our scripture and go into the communion First Corinthians 11 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you that's doing remembrance of me after the same manner also we took the cup we need some saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this new year as often as you drink it in remembrance of me where as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoot the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eating that bread and drink of that cup or he'd eat us and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body now I remember one time brother Mulk said something about this and it really helped me he said you come in here and you're going to fix and take communion and say it here you know that uh let a man examine himself and they said let him eat my wife found something wrong examine yourself you find something wrong he said well the best way to describe that is brother Dale if I said something to you offensively you know and was wrong or something like that and said I come to the communion and I've got to cover up you said something wrong well see the devil will keep telling you don't take communion he said why not just say well okay Lord quickly because I get where I'm going I'll take care of that he said go and take the communion but just make sure you get right on the other because if you don't you're going to bring damnation on your own self I mean if you do something wrong you come up to the communion you think well hey wait a minute I said something to a guy down there at work well I can't go call him up right now so I'll just say Lord I'll take care of that in the morning just make sure that's the first thing you do see he covers it all right I love it for that for this caused many a weekend sickly among you in many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we're chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world or for my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him meet at home that you come not together under condemnation and the wrestle I said in order when I come let's just take a few moments of Silent prayer praying one for the other where the Lord would be with us and forgive us and make us worthy to take the communion and to make all things straight and right in our hearts and lives if we have anything now that needs to be made straight it needs to be taken care of you don't say well hey wait a minute let me get this out of the way and see then that way we just take a little time to pray just pray in one for another thank you just blessing God each and every one of us Lord make us worthy in you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it Lord Jesus we ask you this be with us as we now partake of this communion and we come to the place of breaking the bread because it was a symbol of your broken body for each one of us we know it's not the body it's just in a symbol you know but yet Lord how wonderful assembly is when we do what you say we love you and we thank you sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name as I always tell you I think of the children of Israel when they were getting ready to leave out the last thing they done was at that lamb then they had a place in a park which in a form of the communion they took that and they were ready to leave I think we need to be about getting ready to leave out of here myself and you know I want to anyway but you know what I'm not too bad of shape I I'm kind of enjoying life myself I may have problems hurts and heartaches and troubles but you know what huh I'm still better than a lot of people a lot of people didn't get up this morning sister Johnny always says he says the Lord woke me up well you know not a clock did well he made the clock so you know he's helping us always if we just do that and realize it all would be well and different in what we're doing and we'd have a whole lot of a different life an attitude about things to just realize he's in command he's taking care of everything Lord Jesus we thank you for this wine just went through the process now we ask you to sanctify it's a symbol of thy blood that was shed for each one of us we ask you to sanctify the wine and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you and guide us now in Jesus name amen I know it was the blood I know it was a blood I know it was a blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was a blood oh I know it was a blood I know it was the blood I know it was communion is for everyone who has the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was a blood for me I know it was Supply I I know it was the blood I know it was Sublime thought one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood well whose blood was it it was Emmanuel's plan it was Emmanuel's mind it was Emmanuel's blood for me one day when I was lost he died up on the cross and I know it was a blood for me I know worship what a wonderful thing to be able to think about they were not tied up in things of believing this is a little robotic literal blood Etc we believe the truth it's in symbol form but yet said do this until I come so I'm in the message you stop taking communion because they believe the Lord Has Come that's their business that ain't nothing to you and I we'll take the communion here until the day comes that we're walking off this Earth because I don't believe that means you know until I come to work that I believe it means the last thing we're going to do and you know what we'll get over there the first thing we're going to do marriage supper is not going to be taters and beans it's going to be the communion so why not be with the lies I would love to be I wish it would fall that way that we would be taking communion and then we just go up and we just sat down at the table sit right down at the table and just take the communion it'd be a wonderful time wouldn't it let's all protect together you can be seated for a moment we're getting ready if you'd like to turn into scriptures in John the 13th chapter and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas is Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God and went to God he rides from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and gurged himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and wiped them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord just thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do that I know it's not now but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I washed thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head Jesus saith unto him he that is worse needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed her feet and taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me mastering Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also want to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's Stand Together be dismissed I was reading something in the paper the other day and I was thinking you know in some of the countries like brotherification lives in you know they can be put in jail for trying to convert someone from one belief to another you know it was in the paper the other day I meant to cut it out they're making it to her that it'll be against the law for you to try to convert a person from being a homosexual they're making that law they're taking actually be against you said no school no place no nothing has a right to try to tell somebody for thought to be what they want to be you think we're immune to these things no we're sitting right in the middle of them who's worried about it it even mentioned in our clergy and stuff like that trying to change someone's thinking that they have a right to think what they want the Bible don't give you a right to think what you want we are the children of God we have no right to think we follow what he says right but you see they're going to crack down and do what they want to because they're the law well so that means we've got to be here close to the end time if things are going to start taking place and praise God bring it on let's get under this you know do whatever Prophet said Church done better under persecution yeah I certainly don't want it but that's what he said let's think about these things father as we go now to have the foot washing we pray that you'd bless each and every one of us and guide us and be with everybody on the way home give a safe journey let everything be all right for you Lord we love you and we thank you we pray what we said today has been Lord worthy of being said because I tried but I know when doing the best I can do I still fail in words and terminologies and things that are not right according even to the human language because I just got my own words but I pray Lord that you'd help and guide each one of us and take care of us and give us of your loving grace in Jesus name you dismissed foreign
