[1:57] you want it we have a new air
[1:59] conditioned see if you shut that off
[2:01] there's nothing but stale air in here

[2:18] those of you that are cold you know even

[2:26] off turning back on but most of you did
[2:27] shut it stuff off don't remember terms
[2:30] okay go because I don't do that i do
[2:31] that was that so you know let's they do
[2:35] is leave it on and just deal with it
[2:36] bring your sweater get you get you over
[2:40] all mine oh right what was your question
[2:42] again Brian had a question making an end
[2:50] of iniquity is when they do the
[2:51] reconciliation for anything like a so if
[2:53] you make an end of sin pantis in
[2:55] absolute yep they knew not to kill him
[2:58] right they know he was 10 see brother
[3:01] brown yet they should have known it they
[3:05] were looking for the Messiah it wasn't
[3:06] like that works see the heat member c
[3:08] program said the heath and went even
[3:09] looking for anybody but the jews were
[3:11] definitely looking for a messiah and he
[3:14] came the exact way he was supposed to
[3:16] come right through the bible and they
[3:19] turned him down see that's iniquities
[3:21] actually knowing better they know the
[3:22] Messiah was coming they knew that they
[3:24] were he was supposed to do those things
[3:26] but he said the greatest mistake they
[3:29] made it was in that same damn 17 weeks
[3:31] we may read it later on then the Jews
[3:34] with the greatest mistake they made was
[3:35] is when they said let his blood be on us
[3:38] and our children so for perpetual
[3:41] generations
[3:42] that's what his room has been dispersed
[3:44] killed shot gasps and everything else is
[3:48] because of that one statement they said
[3:50] let his blood be on us in our children
[3:52] that was the same I was that was
[3:56] iniquity and saying both I'm in it
[3:59] anybody in sends the same thing sin
[4:02] because there's a file on there because
[4:04] you when you were a center did you know
[4:09] better no you did it but but once the
[4:13] consciousness comes to you though not to
[4:15] do something and you do it anyway that's
[4:17] iniquity I would say more let me put it
[4:20] this way real simple a center-to-center
[4:22] but a Christian can have an equity we do
[4:26] things that we are supposed to do and we
[4:28] know we ain't supposed to mean that's
[4:30] iniquity okay which is the hideous thing
[4:33] that's knowing to do better because the
[4:35] world today don't know to do better they
[4:38] just fit this under the anointing of the
[4:39] age and and you know they're just
[4:42] they're gonna be judged such but the one
[4:47] is going to be judged them harshest is
[4:48] when it goes up and says have I not cast
[4:51] out devils and all that stuff but shadow
[4:54] remember that Jesus blab it there that's
[4:59] right thank God put daddy he blinded
[5:01] their eyes so that we can come in
[5:06] actually this was one of the question
[5:08] told you we were going to run off some
[5:11] copies but drummer Hoff any copies today
[5:15] my coffee maker was in Atlanta all last
[5:18] week my computer died Jim's computer
[5:21] with her when I could get anything off
[5:23] of so she was done with it sailing not
[5:25] know do not be sorry don't know where
[5:27] that anything else
[5:30] I mean what would you say that in equity
[5:32] is a more advanced age yes seeing is
[5:36] your sin a guy go to smoke cigarettes he
[5:38] smoked always loud he does not get up in
[5:40] the morning and go man all right but
[5:44] right there's no condemnation but now
[5:46] somebody that says going to go to church
[5:49] and say they come to church and I
[5:50] started doing good and justified
[5:54] sanctified cleaned up but remember what
[5:57] island owl said that person will go
[5:58] right back if you don't get it cleaned
[6:00] and swept but the devil is going to come
[6:02] back and bring it again not to me that's
[6:04] iniquity that's knowing you have come
[6:06] under a religious order now you know
[6:08] better and that can't ever go away from
[6:11] you can't believe amnesia and with God
[6:16] he said no you you know you need to do
[6:20] better than get into okay so yes ma'am
[6:23] so we're under this damned is pooping
[6:27] yes that is the six full purpose that is
[6:31] the reason that of the 490 years that
[6:34] they've got to come together is because
[6:36] they did all these hideous things
[6:39] against knowing what hey look even in
[6:41] the Old Testament like we were reading
[6:44] Wednesday night and chronicles doc knew
[6:47] they was going to do that I needed one
[6:49] know how to set but they weren't going
[6:50] to do that and they weren't good they
[6:51] were going to put up gods they were
[6:54] going to put up groves with idols
[6:57] beginning said I'm going to save you hey
[7:00] open offer
[7:02] that's right he gave him out to me they
[7:05] were God's bright they were the Old
[7:09] Testament riot I mean they were the
[7:10] bride of Jesus Christ and for the old
[7:12] customer time but he had to put him away
[7:14] and when he cleared away and she become
[7:16] a servant that's why the hunter point

[10:47] I'm going to tell him everybody this
[10:48] evening about today morning doesn't end
[10:51] up here but when I said that Israel was
[10:54] in captivity for 70 years right three
[10:58] score and ten now I said they were
[11:01] really in captivity for native i miss
[11:03] stated that what i meant was the 70
[11:05] years at least asked me afterward and i
[11:07] said i don't know i went back watch the
[11:09] whole thing what happened in that 70
[11:11] years that they let the lan arrest was
[11:16] typing to 490 years cuz he there in
[11:20] bondage still from their freedom is only

[11:24] and the people right the bari luys i had
[11:28] he asked he asked the question answer

[11:32] working so fast and I told you for
[11:34] tonight they weren't in captivity
[11:35] wearing cap
[11:36] for 70 years but showing that the 490
[11:40] years that they were coming out was
[11:42] hyped by that stable year because during
[11:45] a 70-year what happened to land rest and
[11:49] it was a jubilee for the land but what's
[11:51] going to happen right here at the end of
[11:52] the 490 years it's going to be a jubilee
[11:54] from the land so thank you very much I
[11:56] appreciate that because remember you
[11:57] asking me win tonight and you were a
[11:59] little bit confused not confused with
[12:01] had a question about why wait back home
[12:03] that night and watched it Callay when
[12:05] you get something like when someone
[12:06] asked a question you know it's like
[12:08] Rachel you know somebody said wolf why
[12:10] does she have to go you need to go check
[12:12] out you need to look for yourself if I
[12:15] say something here that that 445 bc is
[12:18] wednesday extend away started don't just
[12:20] agree with me and say well I guess
[12:21] that's what it is because he said no go
[12:23] back to this good luck actually will
[12:28] read it because brother Brad was that it
[12:30] started 45 bc but still I don't I don't
[12:32] take you for that either we should all
[12:35] you need yeah you need to listen to a
[12:37] profit but you gotta run through your
[12:39] filter right you gotta have your own
[12:41] holy ghost I'm not going I'm not I don't
[12:44] get a revelation cuz brother my brother
[12:45] ground go to Revelation right now tell a
[12:47] personal revelation now it's got a tie
[12:49] into that revelation that's what we're
[12:51] going to talk about today brother ground
[12:52] was revelation today in 70 weeks never
[12:55] changed let me tell you again hitting
[12:59] never change never he never changed his
[13:05] his revelation of Daniel 7 2 weeks now
[13:07] most of the message world says he did
[13:11] and what this is what come out of the
[13:14] ministers meeting several years ago was
[13:18] that Brenda Reynold tall in here that
[13:20] basically this whole book was wrong that
[13:25] he was confused well see that's why
[13:27] people leaving a message to things that
[13:29] they talk about is the cloud and dane 17
[13:31] weeks that's the two topics that come up
[13:33] in 1977 well hope wins tonight you saw
[13:36] 1977 exactly my 1977 happened the way it
[13:39] did okay all right but they they don't
[13:44] deny that you
[13:45] never give them to say he was wrong but
[13:47] I asked him I said he preached 3 sermon
[13:50] put it in book form said thus says the
[13:53] Lord many times said the Holy Spirit
[13:54] Tony want to ride I said you're denying
[13:57] this whole book because what they're
[13:59] saying is is he caught down to 70 weeks
[14:01] in 1961 then when the seals broken 63
[14:05] this was all wrong and God updated his
[14:08] revelation because what what they're
[14:13] contending is that yeah he did say and
[14:15] he did we're going to read it he said
[14:17] that the 70th week will happen after the
[14:19] broadleaf seven times in this book he
[14:22] tells us that that after the raft of the
[14:26] church is when the last week will happen
[14:27] then end to end seal bug somebody asked
[14:30] him that question he said no no no Nene
[14:32] night he sa I was wrong he said you
[14:34] misunderstood what I say in another work
[14:36] okay he said no is only three and a half
[14:40] years well well there's only three and
[14:41] half years left ok this is ministry
[14:43] there's always been a half years left
[14:45] and I want to show you something right
[14:47] here this is 1957 1957 before because my
[14:54] contention is if they if it's if it's in
[14:59] continuity with what the preacher from
[15:00] the message say is that if he was wrong
[15:03] here and he granted it in the seals okay
[15:08] then we must contend that that was wrong
[15:11] and anything active before that was
[15:14] wrong and then he come up with a new
[15:16] revelation in 63 of daniel said we come
[15:18] from track the whole mansion upcoming
[15:20] just 97 with okay watch right here 1957
[15:25] is before 1961 this is when he starts
[15:30] preaching he somebody asked him a
[15:32] question will the Jews be saved after
[15:36] the bride leaves are right about that
[15:40] time what
[15:45] now believe it the Gentile Church this
[15:47] is 1957 questions and answers going he
[15:49] breathe now I believe is a Gentile
[15:51] Church will soon to complete completing
[15:53] of the body of Gentile Church the doors
[15:55] between Jesus said in Matthew 24 effect
[15:57] at one scripture from whence they will
[15:58] try down the walls in Jerusalem to
[16:00] attend college especially be finished
[16:01] know what it was given by Lord Jesus in
[16:04] Matthew 24 that the Jews will be taken
[16:06] out of the picture Dana stayed back over
[16:08] the old prophecy said there would be 70
[16:10] of weeks yet allotted to the Jews and
[16:12] the Messiah would come the prince and
[16:15] would prophesy in the midst of a 70 of
[16:18] weeks weeks and say weeks and weeks now
[16:22] watch here's the tea here's the key to
[16:26] the whole thing that people do
[16:28] understand which was the seven years
[16:33] Daniel 70 weeks is not seven years it's
[16:36] 490 what year is he talking about there
[16:41] is no bible that jesus was cut off in
[16:46] the midst of the week that's no
[16:49] scripture find it scripture says he
[16:55] would st. jesus he can make the cover
[16:59] menu for one weekend in the midst of the
[17:00] week he'll call the sacrifice no place
[17:02] in the seat right here that's not Jesus
[17:04] and this is not Jesus ministry Jesus
[17:06] ministry what brother branham is doing
[17:09] listen the whole 70 weeks can be
[17:11] compressed into one week or seven years
[17:16] three and a half years of Jesus's
[17:18] ministry while he was here and three and
[17:20] a half years gives his ministry to the
[17:23] Jews so he was cut off in the middle of
[17:28] that week but not the middle this way
[17:33] because the Bible listened the Bible go
[17:36] back to the Bible the Bible said that
[17:37] when we left when the Covenant is made
[17:40] the road round can't be wrong but but
[17:43] here's my contention if he'd look if
[17:46] he's saying now that there's only three
[17:48] and half years with the prophesied in
[17:50] the midst of the 70 weeks which was the
[17:53] seven years he'd be cut off in the mid
[17:56] look how perfect that Jesus was exactly
[17:58] preach three and a half years he's going
[18:00] back to Jesus ministry and was crucified
[18:02] but there is three that come riding on
[18:05] this earth question here there's three
[18:07] and a half years yet allotted to them to
[18:09] the Jews it's got to be so now hold on a
[18:13] minute now you take this quote go all
[18:16] the way over to nineteen sixty Korean
[18:18] put it with what he said in the seals
[18:19] you say well he's saying the same thing
[18:21] but now have more confused now as the
[18:24] Prophet when he preached in this way
[18:27] contentiously I'm saying when he
[18:29] preached it this way this was only 39
[18:32] years level then he comes up and
[18:34] preaches here that there seven years
[18:35] well Nene goes back preaches in 1953 at
[18:38] this tree and a half years web was he
[18:40] that confused we're going to continue
[18:45] this there's only three and a half years
[18:49] left of Jesus's ministry right the key
[18:54] for the website says the gym there three
[18:58] and a half years yet lauded to them but
[19:01] you got to remember go back to the six
[19:03] whole purpose 30 M is for the people and
[19:08] three of them is going to happen in the
[19:11] seventy weeks of Daniel but they have an
[19:13] after the battle born again you can't
[19:16] bring in everlasting righteousness and
[19:19] build the temple here and then destroy
[19:20] it and then have perfect harmony you
[19:24] know can't do that right so you can't
[19:28] put six photographs one day Tacoma he
[19:30] said read the sinkhole purpose
[19:31] understanding he said that will explain
[19:33] every bit of it and it did the central
[19:35] purpose to me explained and that's what
[19:37] brother Graham preached before he treats
[19:40] the 70th week of Daniel he preached gave
[19:43] Moses instruction to Daniel and then he
[19:44] creates 26 full purpose the six whole
[19:47] purpose will you will go by Rita a faux
[19:49] fur bus brother and whines it rather
[19:52] wear the number six is us entering the
[19:55] but we enter a temple here and then we
[19:57] have a battle of Armageddon to start all
[20:00] where's your Bible so I love love love
[20:04] one brother Brown said he says face
[20:06] final resting places in the word gun you
[20:09] got to put in here first and it brought
[20:11] around made this statement in 57 these
[20:15] statements in 61 we're going to read
[20:17] them there and then a different one is
[20:19] 63 then we do me do it for another
[20:21] problem we did he so confused no he's
[20:27] not he's talking about there was one
[20:30] minister they come up to me and that he
[20:35] said brother branham must be talking
[20:38] about a secret or an inside week that's
[20:42] true because you can condense all the
[20:44] Daniel 70 weeks to the Ministry of Jesus
[20:46] Christ through his self which we get we
[20:52] got that great heavier minister because
[20:54] he cut a lot he was cut off but not for
[20:56] himself French he'll come and destroy
[20:59] the city Titus disperse the Jews again
[21:03] right then in 1949 I started coming back
[21:08] right then you got a three and a half
[21:12] years ministry to bring out to finish
[21:15] transgression we can understand that
[21:16] reconciliation for iniquity this will be
[21:19] the same ministry of jesus christ that
[21:22] you and i are getting today you and I
[21:25] are now living under the Son of Man
[21:27] ministry so there's only when brother
[21:30] Brad watch he would prophesied in the
[21:33] midst of the 70th weeks not week he said
[21:37] we could have been right here this is
[21:39] the 70th week which was the seven years
[21:45] he condensed in you we won't read it
[21:48] today but in Daniel seventy weeks he
[21:50] says at about two more times he said 70
[21:52] weeks that's seven years he condenses
[21:55] all to remember the seventy weeks of
[21:57] Daniel covers 490 years and there's a
[21:59] lot of things you plug in but come down
[22:02] to the very bottom line that three and a
[22:06] half year minutes
[22:07] Jesus Christ it's the whole key you
[22:11] can't get saved I style that
[22:12] three-and-a-half-year ministry Jesus
[22:13] Christ Geor Gentile so God blinded their
[22:18] eyes so the Gentiles could come in now
[22:22] he's got three and a half more years so
[22:23] he was he was cut off in the midst of
[22:25] that son of man ministry to my style
[22:27] week Isaiah 51 51 53 as he was cut off
[22:34] his generation was cut off he was killed
[22:39] look like mom said if you took the
[22:41] Gentiles out and didn't blind them you
[22:44] just pull it right together right here
[22:45] they have the Jews would have been there
[22:47] Jubilee afterwards if you pull them
[22:49] together but you got to separate them
[22:50] and put your gym columns in but you got
[22:53] to go by the Bible the Bible says that
[22:56] he shall confirm the covenant with many
[22:57] for one week who that's the Antichrist
[22:59] we do not see that coming at me we're
[23:01] already interactor for one week he makes
[23:04] that covenant then you got all these
[23:06] scriptures it's got to be fulfilled but
[23:10] there's only three and a half years of
[23:11] Jesus ministry level that's what brother
[23:14] branham he's peeing on every time after
[23:17] he preached this he preached this and
[23:20] broke it down to the people it is to the
[23:24] Jews this whole week is to the dude
[23:26] that's not to us we're gone we're out of
[23:28] here we're doing something else what are
[23:32] we doing you know me I really okay I
[23:36] mean Jesus has already got it settled
[23:39] for us and the reason I said okay it's
[23:41] not that I don't care what God has but
[23:43] he's already got it he's got it lined up
[23:45] for us there's no need for us to sit
[23:47] here in wonder what we're going to do
[23:49] what does it matter what does it matter
[23:53] what your future home house is going to
[23:54] life I don't dwell old man it was made
[23:59] back that theophany this inside of you
[24:02] hey man that's what it was made out of
[24:05] it was made out of that part that's in
[24:07] you right
[24:09] same thing yeah it's been on for a while
[24:11] even while you talking about all them
[24:13] sexy dresses and then so anyway we got
[24:18] my little things here but let you you
[24:23] got to have one week left to finish all
[24:27] those scriptures no watch right let's go
[24:29] through so you got that daniel said the
[24:34] 70 of weeks allotted to the Jews seventy
[24:38] seven seventy times seven 490 years okay
[24:41] but now what you said to Messiah would
[24:42] come to press and will promise on the
[24:44] midst of the 70th week know the Bible
[24:45] doesn't they will say that right it's
[24:50] ready to find it find it we're selling
[24:52] wasabi carving the middle of week and
[24:54] then 10 then it says after sixty two
[25:00] weeks than mice I'll be cut off and then
[25:05] he the prince that shall come will
[25:08] destroy the city in sanctuary I'm almost
[25:10] 40 verbatim now we've been over too many
[25:11] times and he verse 27 to confirm the
[25:15] coming of many for one week that's not
[25:16] Jesus that's not the Messiah it's
[25:19] Antichrist in the midst of the way he's
[25:22] going to cause the sacrifice an oblation
[25:24] to cease and I showed you the other day
[25:25] but Passover so there's three and a half
[25:29] years yet lighted to them to the Jews I
[25:31] believe that amen there's only three and
[25:34] a half years left to that elected and
[25:36] forty-four thousand that's going to be
[25:38] called out of Israel because remember
[25:40] when they go into rapture one more time
[25:44] there's no Holy Ghost on the earth
[25:46] that's why we gone that's my brother
[25:48] Ambrose of Great Tribulation the whole
[25:51] world is going to go through tribulation
[25:53] not justice not just a small one is
[25:55] going to happen around the world because
[25:57] remember this peace treaty that he signs
[25:59] at least for three and a half years
[26:01] Israel is going to be safe right it's
[26:05] what the treaty is it's a
[26:07] right if you'll do this we'll do that
[26:10] but inside that there's going to be two
[26:12] prophets preached the Son of Man
[26:15] ministry that we're getting right now
[26:17] okay to get the Holy Ghost and then
[26:21] they're going to go on a rap trouble on
[26:23] their out of here all hexagon Brinkley
[26:27] bell alarm again okay okay so what which
[26:33] was the seven years so if you'll take
[26:35] all the Daniel seventy weeks squeeze it
[26:37] down to seven years three and a half
[26:40] years of Jesus's ministry here you can
[26:43] see all night three and a half years
[26:45] Jesus ministry that he preached on earth
[26:46] while himself which we get the
[26:50] revelation of because we they were
[26:52] blinded the Jews but they were blinded
[26:54] so that we could get the revelation of
[26:56] it then you had a two thousand year gap
[26:59] right now where you're in that gap right
[27:01] now then he's going to come back and
[27:03] priest we're going to have more years
[27:05] because this indicated through two
[27:08] prophets our two witnesses Moses and
[27:11] Elijah preaching the same brother Brown
[27:14] said the same message this message is
[27:16] going to go over there okay so there's
[27:20] your stare sure seven years so Jesus
[27:24] with what he was coughing a mist of that
[27:26] seven years now when we get over to the
[27:30] seals that's what brother Brown was
[27:32] going to say he said no no you
[27:33] misunderstood he was caught up in the
[27:35] mess the week there's only three and a
[27:36] half years of Jesus's ministry lab well
[27:38] there's only three hundred years in that
[27:39] clip but there's one week left half of
[27:42] the right to the finish seventy weeks of
[27:45] Daniel code remember it's 25 people and
[27:48] this city to me that was the key you
[27:51] didn't say just to the people because
[27:53] Jesus only get I mean the Jews only get
[27:55] the three and a half your ministry of
[27:56] jesus christ the CD don't the Sun the
[28:01] city is going to be level right here
[28:03] remember the Bible says they going to
[28:05] drop a bomb right in the middle of Rome
[28:07] well then we go to destroy everything
[28:10] else you think they gonna leave you
[28:11] think Jerusalem is going to be safe I
[28:12] like knowing just going to be heathen
[28:14] Jews
[28:15] he's an Jews and Gentiles and everybody
[28:17] else so they got to rebuild the temple
[28:19] sometime in here I don't know why that
[28:22] really matter because it's not it's not
[28:24] for us today it's for the Jews today
[28:27] they're going to build a temple we're
[28:29] going to come back into that temple
[28:30] according to the sixth fold purpose is
[28:35] where the temple is anointed with our
[28:37] presence coming back in Revelations 19
[28:41] riding back in the Millennium with us
[28:44] and 144,000 and the fifth fields you see
[28:48] you've got to see this is going to be a
[28:49] Jewish time that's why i was talking
[28:50] about wednesday night this is that you
[28:52] believe they've been looking for this is
[28:56] the jubilee that the Jews been looking
[28:57] for God told him 70 years i'm going to
[29:00] make that land rest i'm gonna get
[29:03] whether you like it or not in other
[29:05] words but then you try the 490 years
[29:08] into that 70 cuz remember seventy weeks
[29:10] from what Daniel was looking at is
[29:13] already finished it was finished back
[29:16] Daniel was in the 68 year of captivity
[29:19] two more years they went out but you
[29:22] gotta remember they didn't go out and
[29:25] was free they never been free who ruled
[29:29] Jerusalem when Jesus was that wrong how
[29:34] does a Roman 0 killed him and destroy
[29:37] them and put them on all over the place
[29:39] send them out into all them all over the
[29:41] world and then they started coming back
[29:43] during the World War that's what Hitler
[29:48] was so mad Hitler was killing Jews all
[29:49] the time cuz they had the money so so
[29:56] then you got all the six and a half
[29:57] million that were killed because they
[29:58] were Jews all right the end in 1949 they
[30:03] became a nation so you can really say
[30:05] from 49 till now is really the only time
[30:08] they have been free but have they been
[30:09] free no that's still in the captain they
[30:13] don't know Jesus Christ and the world is
[30:15] just the world is wanting to kill the
[30:17] whole town right don't tell you don't
[30:20] get your freedom is really when they go
[30:21] that temple this yield you comes up all
[30:25] that 144 Val
[30:27] and they see the Gentile come in that's
[30:30] when that Jubilees don't start this one
[30:32] said there's no can't be extended for a
[30:33] few blade can't go to 20 27 with 20 27

[30:41] 71st Jubilee I don't see it happen I
[30:44] just don't I just don't it nineteen
[30:46] forty nine to twenty nineteen years and
[30:51] seven year how about that how about that
[30:58] there was something else Louise brought
[31:00] to my attention win tonight he says come
[31:02] strange there your dad preached in 74
[31:06] that that about that about the date you
[31:09] know from 74 to 77 it's three years and
[31:12] then here we are now speaking on on
[31:15] Daniel seventy weeks in 2016 looking at
[31:19] 2019 that's three more years so so God
[31:22] may be in a cycle here in ain t nana
[31:25] cycle he's trying to put us in one yeah
[31:28] yeah you don't need a cycle with us as
[31:30] human beings we need to have our brain
[31:32] jogged every once in a lot you know so
[31:35] all right everybody got them so this
[31:38] three and a half years allotted to them
[31:40] to the Jews it's got to be if I
[31:43] understand that that's the prophecy of
[31:45] the 1260 days of two prophets preaching
[31:48] the Ministry of Jesus Christ the Son of
[31:50] Man ministry right remember we preached
[31:55] on some man son of God yet all right
[31:57] we're living under the Son of Man
[31:58] ministry now but if we don't get a
[32:00] revelation that we're still under the
[32:01] Son of God revelation which is not bad
[32:03] it's about to his mother Holy Ghost and
[32:05] we get a revelation for our time but the
[32:07] son of man ministries the only thing
[32:08] it's going to take us in a rapture son
[32:10] of man ministries don't think gonna take
[32:11] them to my okay they're like to be
[32:15] killed we will have to be killed if
[32:19] we're the page we take a body change
[32:20] won't be
[32:21] all right Congrats gonna it's gonna be
[32:25] 2019 some two years old I write labs
[32:30] that have to spend they're not gonna
[32:32] give it a right hot right the only thing
[32:35] is they can't have the Holy Ghost now
[32:37] because that's my whole contingent you
[32:40] say well we got to use opening up the
[32:42] Holy Ghost and they're going to be the
[32:43] to Edison can't happen brother Brown
[32:47] says when the rapture happens everybody
[32:49] that has the Holy Ghost is going to
[32:50] leave so they don't have to get it right
[32:53] there afterwards though so have some way
[32:56] and it can begin a one we going after
[32:58] one man a very next day they can go with
[32:59] instra and receive the Holy Ghost and
[33:01] start preaching to them because you you
[33:03] know what they do they listen to it take
[33:06] make you listen to or whatever you know
[33:08] taking they get a message preached to
[33:11] them they finally little quick and
[33:12] everything that they need and then
[33:13] they'll take this message and take it on
[33:15] for 1260 days listen our website
[33:23] yes all right here we go now that is
[33:26] 1957 brother Brown says that Messiah
[33:29] would prophesied in the midst of the
[33:31] 70th weeks which was 27 years does
[33:34] everybody understand that but I want you
[33:37] to run off a copy of that thing you made
[33:39] you know the charge huh yep and we'll
[33:42] look at next Sunday because it's
[33:43] beautiful but everything is hinged on
[33:47] just seven years the 445 bc into
[33:52] bringing in and building the walls
[33:54] that's just a build-up to okay the jesus
[33:58] coming then all this other two thousand
[34:00] years is the build-up to this coming but
[34:03] there's only three and a half years is
[34:05] his ministry here over there that he
[34:08] preached himself then there's three and
[34:10] a half years of uses main street to the
[34:12] Jews that's your seven years and he was
[34:14] cut off in the middle of that week that
[34:16] Messiah wait you watch it will read it
[34:19] even into a silver he talks about
[34:23] massage my silence on one side he
[34:25] doesn't talk about the land and all this
[34:27] other things being built costs about my
[34:29] side well this is the only Messiah week
[34:31] there is left there's three and a half
[34:32] years over there three and half years
[34:34] here so if we brother Graham said he was
[34:36] caught up in the midst of the week he's
[34:38] telling you that there's seven year
[34:40] Ministry of Jesus Christ you can
[34:43] compress all that seventy weeks of
[34:44] Daniel into that one week if I got that
[34:47] yes if I got it got it got it though you
[34:52] either laughing it up any attention by
[34:54] big guy okay thank you alright so now
[35:00] let's go to that was 1957 now we're
[35:03] going to go to Gabriel construction to
[35:05] Daniel could not freeze up
[35:10] all right here we go now look this is
[35:14] gareth instructions to Daniel got the
[35:19] first book called the schedule
[35:21] instructions to Daniel six-fold purpose
[35:24] and then the 70th week there i got that
[35:26] this is Gables instructions to Danny
[35:29] mean got none for nothing Bravo
[35:36] revelation 61 revelation 19 21 it's
[35:40] connected with the 17 weeks what forever
[35:44] lesson 6 1 beginning of the seal listen
[35:49] to 60 literally opens during this time
[35:51] right here the two prophets go back d 6
[35:57] they will start reading a steelbook
[35:58] because you see the sixth seal is these
[36:01] two prophets bringing fire bringing
[36:06] tornado earthquake whatever fire
[36:08] proceedeth out of their mouth stay open
[36:11] the students deal alright so for
[36:15] revelation 6 12 19 21 is connected with
[36:18] the 70 weeks now let me ask you a
[36:23] question revelation 6 1 starts to sealed
[36:28] revelations 1921 is what us riding back
[36:32] into the Millennium in 1921 or I started
[36:39] to read the whole Tiger the revelation
[36:41] 19 21 from 61 and 19 21 is connected
[36:46] with the 70 weeks now hold on a minute
[36:48] if I know it three and a half years left
[36:50] as most people say then we're going to
[36:53] ride back in the Millennium around here
[36:55] okay huh okay how
[37:00] therefore we must stop and explain
[37:02] before we go further we must stop and
[37:05] explain why these 70 of weeks because if
[37:07] you don't you'll miss the seals what you
[37:10] will be able to play some right because
[37:17] if you don't you miss those seals you
[37:19] missed the trumpets what the trumpets at
[37:21] all trumpets sound under the sixth seal
[37:23] which is the prophets how outstanding if
[37:29] you didn't get that you wouldn't know
[37:30] the one to trumpet sound they might
[37:33] understand that region still book read
[37:37] the face of the trumpets Brown said he
[37:38] preached on supernaturally in the sixth
[37:41] seal that all trumpets one through seven
[37:44] sound under the sixth seal which is
[37:46] right this is the message hmm which is
[37:50] message store that's correct too that's
[37:53] correct trumpet what is it trumpet what
[37:58] so I blow the horn you turning look you
[38:01] know and they said they sound a message
[38:04] one of them is retrieved one of them is
[38:07] charged because back then they didn't
[38:09] have cell phones in and walkie-talkies
[38:10] to let sound a trumpet to either charge
[38:13] or to retreat throw a trumpet what makes
[38:16] the sound you will miss the bowels and
[38:19] plagues three unclean spirits like frogs
[38:22] three whoa when does the third will
[38:24] happen go ahead third world war got it
[38:31] casting out of the red dragon woman in
[38:33] the Sun another woman in the Sun we know
[38:36] comes to Israel cops us too but comes to
[38:39] Israel because they hide her for three
[38:41] and a half years 1260 days they hide
[38:44] hurt they can't be key open till the end
[38:46] of that 1260 days right all right okay
[38:49] you'll miss it all if you don't cut the
[38:52] tape place right here in this 70th week
[38:58] what I just explained to you happens
[39:01] right here that's that last week that's
[39:05] why I told you they'll be more scripture
[39:06] fulfilled from right here to right here
[39:08] then then even when Jesus was on earth
[39:11] the district do you read that it takes
[39:16] place right here in this 70th week
[39:21] that's where it takes place right now go
[39:26] the National he comes up now to the six
[39:27] full purpose 64 Perkins no right here's
[39:32] part of your answer so Israel get it
[39:34] wrong to God and in this 70th week not
[39:38] this half week the 70th week what's
[39:42] going to happen God is going to finish
[39:44] the transgression of Israel finish the
[39:46] transgression will be turning away the
[39:48] ungodliness from Jacob and then all
[39:51] Israel will be born again now all Israel
[39:55] all Israel that's going to be safe
[39:58] 144,000 okay now all of them will
[40:01] receive the Holy Spirit finish the
[40:04] transgression transgressing against you
[40:08] is to do our own to you if you'll read a
[40:11] six-foot purpose you'll get your answer
[40:12] more clear maybe than I and I hit it
[40:14] okay but this is a 6-volt purpose in
[40:17] this 70th week what's going to happen
[40:18] God going to finish the transgression of
[40:20] Israel alright if I got that here we go

[40:40] Daniels 70th week rather coming to make
[40:43] an end of sin put it away in this 70th
[40:46] week in the sin he's coming right on
[40:49] down all right what's the First Minister
[40:51] aggressive man you understand number
[40:52] three tomi reconciliation for iniquity
[40:56] they wrote this down now there's a party
[40:59] answer their right to make
[41:00] reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is
[41:02] doing wrong as they did at the cross he
[41:05] made reconciliation but it will not be
[41:07] applied to them it was not applied to
[41:10] them why because they were blinded he
[41:11] could not see it why did they buy the
[41:14] wine because blinded them coach what
[41:15] you're blind because you're willfully
[41:17] blind God blinded them so that we could
[41:20] come in we can't say God blinded us we
[41:22] willfully blind ourselves everybody got
[41:24] that yeah we are getting nowhere
[41:33] okay let's read this one then we'll come

[41:37] have our sex education class it's
[41:39] virtually don't stand in my dresses all
[41:45] right look I'm sorry I all I think about
[41:50] this all the time say you know this I'm
[41:52] brain dead when it comes down the hill
[41:54] then down your on earth do I start
[41:56] dealing with the Jews there will be two
[41:57] prophets the eleventh chapter will pick
[41:59] it up two anointed prophets like a lot
[42:01] of Moses who I think it is and they'll
[42:03] bring great cursors after they have seen
[42:04] that them consolidated in Rome has
[42:07] broken this covenant that primped and in
[42:10] the middle of this 70th week what's the
[42:14] middle 73 and a half hit break its
[42:19] covenant with Rome or wrong we'll break
[42:22] it with Israel and that caused the
[42:24] abomination to begin to scatter and
[42:26] they'll be the great flood when the
[42:28] Gentile realm of the sleep of burden the
[42:30] dragon romford of water average mouth
[42:32] goes remember they're killing the
[42:33] foolish virgin in here yeah night people

[42:41] get part of the message and whatever
[42:42] they can they're going to be killed all
[42:44] full version listen there's gonna be
[42:45] eight times more of them than our rugs
[42:47] if you take your type of Noah and you
[42:53] know II not was one knowing his family
[42:56] were eight brother Brown said that's the
[42:58] fools version called they carried sin in
[43:00] the are right then they come out and
