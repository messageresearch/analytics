seated just for a second i'm going to do something a little bit different tonight tonight i want to speak on the final type post but before um before i do that i've just been kind of meditating on some things that um uh that you know there's all these different videos and things circulating about the way that young people think and and so forth and so i i wanted to just play a little clip for y'all and that the brothers can bring up that's only three minutes before i preach and uh what it is is as there's some folks down in alpharetta that went around to different user university campuses and they went and interviewed some of the young people and just talked to them about the lord and and it's really interesting the way that they react and so it's real quick but i want you to just just just real pay attention to the to the to the responses they they say to the some of the questions they're asked and then i'll preach on them so i'm just going to stand up here and y'all and y'all go ahead and play it so for you um would you tell me that i'm wrong if i said that i was a christian do you think that that's wrong no no okay i think it's right um it's not right or wrong it's uh it's your personal belief you have the right to believe what you want to believe anything can be true even alive a good amount of people believe in it but then does that make it true if it's a lie yeah because usually it's the majority the majority out rules the minority when it comes to things like that someone can say jesus is god's son and if a lot of people believe that then for that majority group it's true but for everyone else is not so if i got everybody in the universe somehow to look at you and say you're not a real person or you're not really you know alive or don't really exist would that make it true just because everybody says it i always say yeah is there a difference between true truth and someone's own truth i think there is but sometimes it doesn't matter is all truth vow the truth yes do you believe in absolute truth no so i know this is a crazy example yeah but let's say there's a culture that thinks it's really cool when you're five years old to have a ceremony where you stick you know burning hot poles into their eyes okay is that right or wrong morally subjective we kind of evolved from that because if you go back like i'd say 3 000 years ago that was just uh that was that's kind of sounds like a ritualistic approach to a boy becoming a man now would be wrong but that back then you know it would have been bad no not really nazi germany for example um do you think that they were wrong to kill six million jews yes why i guess because i was bred to think that it's wrong to single out a minority and kill them off um but maybe in other cultures that would be looked at as normal let's say um i really wholeheartedly thought that that trash can was god if i believed it's true you would agree with me it's your belief i mean it has nothing to do with me so yeah who determines what truth is you do what is truth truth is okay that's hard i think truth is something that is like universal yeah i think to build off of that i think it's something that's like very widely accepted um and that is valid i guess if that makes sense this is all truth valid truth is all truth valid truth um yeah i would say so all truths about truth what you just said yeah let's say two people believe things that are completely opposed to each other is that possible for someone to be wrong about their truth no no no because your truth is you're true everyone perceives the world differently so it doesn't matter like to me most of the time it's just like your own truth it doesn't matter all the time what other people think i feel like people can definitely have two different viewpoints and still be their truth whatever you believe is your truth that's what the truth is and uh you know if you talk if you talk to young people you've ever had a chance to really talk to young people you can see that it's not just something that's out there it the devil moves and he's trying to he's trying to do something and uh if you want to research that further what that's called is post-modernism where post-modernism the idea behind post-modernism is there is no truth so this morning or this afternoon i want to read from the book of acts in chapter chapter 20 and just take a take a topic out of this scripture as the final thai post lord jesus we're so grateful for truth lord and so grateful to know you so grateful to know you in the power of your resurrection lord jesus lord surely the things that we just heard are scary lord and lord but thank god that we've got a typo something that we can hang on to that we can hang our soul and hang our life and hang everything that we are on to lord and we just ask lord that tonight lord that maybe you'll answer some questions lord jesus and you'll you'll speak right to the need of somebody tonight lord and we just ask your blessing upon the service that you'll feel at liberty to move among us lord jesus and make these words not just not just dead letters on the page but lord let them leap off lord to a living reality in our hearts and lives granted lord that you'll just bless this service we ask in your name amen so paul here's somebody in in acts that that that's that's speaking uh in acts chapter 20 verse 22 and 24 that had had done a lot of bad things and uh gone down the wrong path but then god got a hold of him and he found that final thai post and he said now behold i go bound in the spirit of jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me none of these things move me neither count on my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received with the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so paul what a strange thing there to to think about that paul found something that so tied him down so so rooted him and grounded him to where he could face death and he'd say i it doesn't move me i'm not moved by all the things i'm not moved by being lowered over the wall in a basket i'm not i'm not moved by being stoned to death and then raised up i'm not moved by any of those things i'm not moved by face and death at jerusalem he found the final thai post now now let's just meditate on that video we just watched and and and kind of think about some of the things that we just heard people saying that that you know the devil has got people so tied up that they don't even know what's right and wrong that that go to these universities and this is in georgia now this is right down the road from where i live this is in georgia and the devil's got people so tied up they don't even know what truth is that when you ask them there's that other video circulating that some of you might have heard of some of the brothers talking about it's called what is a woman because they they ask they go and ask people what's a woman and they can't even answer because they don't even know what what truth it can't even they can't even get down to what what reality is but listen now let's just meditate on some of these responses that we heard being a christian the first one being a christian is not right or wrong you got the right to believe whatever you want to believe it's not right or wrong was it right or wrong we should be able to nail it down it's either right or wrong it's neither right or wrong is what the response is the next one anything anything can be true even a lie if enough people if you got enough people to believe it anything can be true even a lie that you heard it right out of the the fellow's mouth any can anything can be true even a lie and the majority out rules the minority if enough people say jesus is god's son then even if if enough people believe that and for that majority group it's true so if you've got enough people to believe it then that makes it true or if everybody in the universe got together and said you weren't a real person that would be a true statement and you heard it right out of their mouth and if everybody said that that would make it true the difference between truth and someone's own truth sometimes doesn't matter now see see tonight i i wanna i wanna just speak that it does matter it matters what you believe there there is a truth there is a real true something something there's a right answer and a wrong answer there's there's something that gives meaning to everything that we're looking at everything that we're doing there's there's a there's a truth the question was asked do you believe an absolute truth and and the girl said no there's in other words there's no absolute absolute what is absolute truth absolute truth is it's something concrete that's unchanging that never changes that that that is it that matches reality reality truth is what reality is reality is what truth is sticking hot coals in someone's eyes is not subjectively wrong and three out three thousand years ago wouldn't have been bad germany was only wrong to kill six million jews because of our our upbringing and other cultures that might be considered normal or what about this if i said that trash can was god would you agree with me it's your belief it ain't got nothing to do with me so sure i'll go along with it or who who determines what truth is is the question that was posed and the answer was you do you think about a society that we live on where you can just make up whatever you you want to you want us to be the truth and whatever whatever you say the truth is that's the way it is and that that sounds like madness to me you see what we see what a quagmire or the devil has got this world in where nobody even knows what's right and wrong and nobody even nobody even believes there is a right or wrong if you believe things that are completely opposed is it possible for someone to be wrong no your truth is their truth is what the answer was it's your own truth it doesn't matter what other people think people can have two different viewpoints and it's still be their truth whatever you believe is your truth that's what the truth is now see that's just that's some scary stuff right there and but thank god for the truth so maybe tonight i want to just ask you what what do you believe i'm sitting here tonight there might be all kinds of thoughts you know the young people go to school and they get bombarded by that but i want to challenge that i want to challenge your thoughts i want to challenge the things that the environment that you've been in school and and the the influence that you have in the world the people that you go to work with i want to challenge that tonight because there is a truth there is a right and wrong every time you go out in the world and you're you're confronted with something you have to make a choice there's a right way to go and a wrong way to go no matter what the devil tells you what no matter what the lie of the devil is that it don't matter it does matter and sitting here tonight it matters what you believe it matters what you're receiving it matters it matters the course that you go in life it matters what kind of job you take or what church you go to it matters where you hit sit at home and listen to a tape or go to a church where the five full ministry is preaching all these things matter do you believe in an unchangeable universal truth or do you believe the truth is what you make it do you believe everybody's got a point or do you believe that it matters what you believe see these are questions that need answering these are questions that you've got to come to conclusion to these are questions that matter do you is there a universal truth and i want to declare to you tonight there there is a universal truth there is something that we could tap into that stretches beyond all the time and all eternity that something that you can that will anchor your soul and anchor your life and anchor your family and give you peace and love and joy that the world don't know anything about you know if you if you go watch those videos if you go find them online and watch that it's called a road trip the truth they'll go the point they end up making is that people that don't know what truth is that's why there's all this depression and things because people don't know what the reason the reason for life or the reason for living is and they don't even know that there's there's a right or wrong or nothing the end of their story is that it just doesn't matter what i do but it matters you matter there's a purpose in your life and you matter to god enough that he came down and died for you on the cross and it matters what is real and it matters what you believe that's why paul could say in acts chapter 20 behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there a man that had found something that could go bound down into jerusalem freely knowing that he would give his life saved that the holy ghost witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me move me neither count on my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy he had found something that he could be anchored to to the point that he was willing to give his whole life over to it to lay his life down on the altar of sacrifice to give everything over to this and you think you think how do we know that the gospel is real because these 500 men saw jesus after he rose and they were willing to give their life and lay down their life all these men that we read about in the bible found something that was real it's more real than all that nonsense they feed you in school it's more real than all that stuff you see on tv it's more real than that gobbledygook you read about in the newspaper we found something we found the final top post in the gospel paul had found something to rest everything on and you can find something to rest everything oh too you can find something to rest your life and your soul and everything that you are and i want to say to you tonight that you'll never be a success in anything if you can't distinguish right and wrong you will never be a success and nothing if you can't tell the truth from the false you can you won't be a success if you can't tell the good and the bad and the wrong and the right you've got to have a tie post you've got to have something that you can anchor to and say this is this and this is that everyone's got to find something to tie to you're tied to tied to every great achievement every everybody's to every person and everything that's been did or done this is what brother brown said rather there has been an absolute connected with it everybody that's been amounted to anything had an absolute tie to him there's got to be something for it's the final time post there's got to be something first the final time post you know what what what you're tied to is what will determine the decisions that you make in life your decisions are based on what you're tied to if you're tied to the devil you're going to make that kind of decision you're tied to the devil then you uh it's a young man or a young woman tied to the devil they're the decisions around a wedding or it's going to or whether they even get married is going to be tied to that what they do with a bachelorette party or what they do with the bachelor party is going to be tied to the devil the life that the kind of home that they have is going to be tied to the devil but you get anchored in christ and everything changes and your decisions are based upon something else it's based upon the word of god who to marry and where to live and where to go to church and if you will go to church and all your life goals or whether or not you even have life goals are all tied to that tie post what you're tied to but we try to tie off to all kinds of stuff we try to tie off to most of the time it's our own opinions you know sometimes you you get around and you start talking about the word of god and and even then in that situation people begin to they start talking about well i think well i think this and i think that but you know what no nobody cares about what you think the devil don't care about what you think we don't you if i come up here with my own opinion you wouldn't care what i think you can't tie to your own opinions that's not a typos it don't matter what we think but i tell you what does matter is the word of god if you get anchored back to the word of god that's the only thing that matters we'll tie back to the popular opinion that's one thing that the kids have trouble with at school and people adults have problems with that because we'll try to tie to the most popular doctrine of what all the other preachers are preaching about it will tie to what everybody in school is thinking what what the popular opinion is but that's that's that's sinking saying we'll try to try to tie to the church's opinion if you know if you're tired of anything else anything other than the word of god you've got a tie post that's on sink and saying you got something that'll get frayed you're tied down to something that'll unravel and we'll leave you stranded one day maybe we'll tie to our favorite minister's opinion somebody that we really hold in high esteem and then after a while things they begin to say some strange things and maybe that'll all unravel you see you can't tie to a person you can't tie to an opinion but the only thing that's stable is god's word if we can get tied to that final top host everything will come out all right brother ham said god cannot say anything and ever take it back that's why we base our hopes upon god because god being infinite he cannot change you know you think about what a what a great thing that is we've got something that we can anchor to a god that can never change that if you could if you meet him in the same way that abraham met him in the same way that enoch met him in the same way that moses met him that you can get the same results if you come to him with faith believing because he's an unchanging god and he never changes that's the kind of tie post i'm talking about tonight you see the devil the devil don't care about any of them other typos you'll never be able to defeat the devil with any of the other other type hosts of our own opinions and our own thoughts and our own the things that we think the devil does not care about our own opinions in romans chapter 14 it says him that is weak in the faith receive you but not to doubtful disputations now the new living translation says accept other believers who are weak in the faith and don't argue with them about what they think is right or wrong because you see you you start talking to somebody this week in the faith and and it can turn into a turned into an argument about what what are arguments i think and you think and i think and what you think doesn't matter you sit there and you start arguing about stuff and arguing doesn't accomplish nothing that's something that's taken me a long time to learn but sitting there and going back and forth with somebody ain't going to accomplish nothing well because what we need we need to be anchored we need a revelation for our own self sometimes we want to argue it out with our kids and and beat them over the head with all of our wisdom and the knowledge and stuff but what everybody needs is a revelation for ourselves because you got to be tied for yourself you got to be tied for that typos yourself all the arguing in the world because what is it it's not it's not trying to reason it into somebody it's not trying to pack in the intellectual understanding but we've got to be anchored in christ christ is our absolute in galatians paul said for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet please men i should not be the servant of christ why are we not trying to please men because our opinions don't matter our opinions don't matter one iota in proverbs chapter 18 a fool has no delight in understanding but that his heart may discover itself and the english standard version said as a fool takes no pleasure and understanding but only in expressing his opinion he only wants to discover what's what he thinks in his in his heart is right you ever talk to somebody that's like well i think i think think think think and all all they're talking about what they think instead of instead of the laying laying something taking you back to a foundation of of where they got it from take it back to the encyclopedia take it back to an old person that you got it from that knew how to work on a car or something take it back to something that's real but see our opinions don't matter in romans chapter 8 verse 7 the carnal mind is enmity against god our carnal mind of all our opinions what we think is right what we think is what we think is right or wrong if we if we rely on what we think will be like that man that said that if you say that trash can is god then well that because that's that's as far as the carnal mind will take you the carnal mind is no anchor because it's at enmity against god it's it's against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither can be and second corinthians chapter 10 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves that talk about how good they are and their own opinions are but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise see when you compare yourself with somebody else you're not wise when you measure yourself against somebody else you're not wise why because our own stature and our own opinions and what we think about things do not matter maybe think about that when you go to school when you go to university and think about the opinions that the teachers are giving you and think about the opinions that your friends are giving you those opinions if they're contrary to the word of god don't matter at all you got to take everything back to the only solid typos which is the word of god and the devil's trick is to damage your confidence in that final type host that's what he did in the garden of eden is he damaged eve's confidence he got her to walk up from from behind the word and begin to think that she had a better understanding than the preachers go to school and listen to all that tommy rot and all that filth and stuff where they they pack into your mind where there ain't no truth there's no way for you to know truth truth is whatever you make it a and and the devil will begin to to sow and use this confidence in the in the ministers and the gospel of this age has tried to get you into the right mind they see the devil's lie is there's no right or wrong that everything's subjective that your opinion matters that isn't that like the lie of the age that your opinion matters your opinion does not matter at all your opinion does not matter oh if we could get to a place where we could die out to our own self and crawl up on that altar of sacrifice like abel did when he identified himself with his sacrifice we could realize that our opinions doesn't matter our own efforts don't matter our own works don't matter but christ is everything that we depend on christ is the one that we're anchored to christ is the one that we look to for everything we have need of he's that final type host there's a lot of shaky things to tie off to but there's one final unchanging type host that can never be moved and that's christ in his word and brother said and man cannot cannot by no means achieve anything until there comes somewhere where they recognize that there is an absolute now you think let's meditate on that you can't achieve nothing until you realize that there is an absolute there there is a truth i'm talking about a universal truth not just what you make it sitting here tonight sitting here tonight you might in your own mind think well well i i i want to do what's hap what makes me feel good i want to do what makes me happy i want to cut my hair the way i want to cut it i want to dress the way i want i want to dress but you see all those things will take you down the road wrong road you'll never be able to achieve anything until there comes somewhere where you recognize that there is an absolute and brother adam said that final typo is the last word he said it's the amen he said you hear people say absolutely that's it that's the last thing there's nothing else in its way it's the supreme it's an ultimate and an ultimate is when primarily an ultimate because you've reached the end it's the amen it's the it's the final thing the the final say like like the supreme court in the land or or a policeman that stops you on the road that's the final you you can't say nothing else because you've reached the ultimate you've reached a place where there's no argument there's no excuse there's nothing you can say what are you going to do if you if you come to the place where you stand at the white throne judgment what would you say what excuse would you make when the word has been preached when it's been laid before you and you'd say well you had come up maybe with all kinds of excuses well i was tired and that's why i didn't go to church and maybe i i forgot to get gas the night before and that's why i didn't come to church and these are the reasons why i didn't want to become a christian but you see the final type post is the ultimate when you reach that ultimate there is no excuse there's no opinion that you can you can raise there's no argument you can raise to reach that final ultimate arg the final tie post and brother i said one time in a doctor's office i was speaking to a doctor you see we you gotta have something that you base everything on he was talking to a doctor and he said the doctor said i believe that a man could appropriate enough faith that he could go out of here and touch this tree and be healed now listen to what brother brown said he said i believe i believe you could have enough faith and you could just go lay your hand on a tree and be healed and brother i'm saying no you gotta have an absolute you gotta have something that you can base your faith on i said but doctor how could a man ever appropriate enough faith to touch a tree and be healed because there is no background to that there's no place you can tie to it because it's not scripturally a foundation you got to have a foundation you got to have something to base your faith in we can't base our faith in one another's opinions or in a tree or in a cloud or something like that but you can base your faith on the word of god you've got to have something that you can tie to to know that this is it you got to be able to tie into it and brother around told that story about how he went to the hospital to pray for this little girl that had had got into a place where she didn't even know where she was at and he went in there and he began to pray for her and and he had a vision he said i looked back and the vision left me and said normal does she have a the the little girl's mother was normal does she have a boyfriend kind of tall and dark hair yes i said does he do something with them in singing i said yes that's right i said don't you worry i have thus saith the lord she is coming out of it now now norma got tied into that she was she was she got anchored in what a prophet of god said and she said brother ryan said norma threw her hands and caught me by the knee looked up to her husband said honey it's never wrong it's never wrong now if we could have that same kind of attitude about the word of god that it's never wrong said it's never wrong and about two hours from in the phone was just ringing when i come up from mr woods down below and it was her father he was on the phone he said brother branham i got something to tell you said you hadn't been gone 20 minutes until she come to herself normally and she's been examined by the whole staff of doctors were taking her home in the morning and he said you got in everything you got to have somewhere you could tie down to now see she she was so tied down to that prophet of god when he said he said i saw a vision thus saith the lord she said it's never wrong and she was so confident in what he said now can't we be that confident in the word of the lord that's laid in these pages that when we read by his stripes we're healed he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity he all these promises that are laying there in the bible and when you see it if you can have that kind of a confidence that it's not just letters laying on the page but christ that's rhythm from the grave and may these words come to life and that's what anchors you that not the letters on the page but the risen christ that's made it real to you you've got to have somewhere you can tie down to that's why in mark chapter 13 it says heaven on earth shall pass away pass away but my words shall not pass away and these are not these are not just empty words but you think about if all of heaven and all of earth were to be burned up and to be no more and to be completely consumed we still have a confidence that his words will never pass away so if you're anchored into his words his words will never pass away that's that's the name that's a sure tie post that's something real and that's what paul was sold out to in philippians chapter 1 he said according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness is always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death whether i die or whether i live christ will be magnified in me that's the kind of typos that paul was anchored to for to me to live as christ and to die is gain but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet what i shall choose i what not paul was so anchored he didn't care whether he lived or died as long as christ was manifested in his members and and would say a great brawler giving out great threats and doing things against the church of god making havoc of it and even persecuting it unto death and one day on the road down that's the reason he had this christ in her life is because he personally and brother said now laying aside his teaching he personally met christ listen there's there's been a lot of people that understood some things in the bible but you got to meet christ christ is the one that makes the bible live christ is the one that makes the bible real he's the one that wrote the bible they spoke it through the apostles and prophets you got to meet christ and brother said that's the only way that you're ever going to know him is to meet him to know him his life not even know his word now let's see does that trip you up tonight not even know his word as good as it may be yet you've got to know him to know him as life you see because you can read the bible and know all the greek and everything and say well this greek word means this and we can explain it what dunamis means and all those things but to know him actually brings it off of the page and gives you the understanding of what it is it puts the pieces together so you're not looking at daniel seven weeks over here the statue of a perfect man over here and the headstone over here and all these different parts and pieces all laying separate but christ comes and puts it together for you and you see him you've got to know him and the power of his resurrection you got to see who he is and don't do it don't do you any good just to read read about him on the page but when he becomes a living reality to you that's what the anchory is paul stood right in the midst of the people those jews and so forth he knowed who he had believed he would by no means have did it if he hadn't found something that was genuinely anchored him you think about paul's life before that how he knew the scripture he had said under under gramelia that great teacher and he he could he could talk about the scripture but he didn't have that anchor i'm talking about the anchor now i'm talking about christ not just an intellectual understanding of the word but i'm talking about christ that can make the word live that can fulfill the word in your feet and your hands and your walk and your talk to make these virtues live in you that it's not just something that you read about that it's not like a newspaper anymore but it's like a love letter that you can open up and read between the lines that christ means something to you that it's not just dead letters where you're just coming to church and going through the motions but it's come off the page into your life and it's real to you that's what i'm talking about you've got to be anchored into him are you angry tonight do you know him and the power of his resurrection do you know that he's come forth from that grave and that he's not dead do you know that it's not dead up there in jeffersonville but it's alive tonight and you and brother brown said i think any christian should be that way every believer and meet god upon those sacred sins where there's no philosopher can explain in a way you met god and you know it and there's nothing could ever hide it away from you to come on those sacred sands like moses did where he took his shoes off because he realized that he was on holy ground to realize that there is a real god that there's a real power that's beyond all the things that you can see with your moral eyes that no philosopher can explain it you know what philosophy is philosophy is just trying to trying to trying to piece things together to give you a little bit understanding of the fundamental nature of knowledge and reality and existence trying to trying to like when you talk to somebody and you try to dig in well let me see what let me see what your problem why are you shy why are you why do you have this problem that's all philosophy where you're trying to you're trying to poke around in somebody's psyche and something but that's an experience with god goes beyond all the philosophy where we're trying to piece it together with our intellectual understanding and brotherhood said we have times that we have great scholarship and nothing against that that's all right but all that goes good but you personally have got to meet god to a place that no one can twist any scriptures you were there you're the one that met him you had the experience of it you know him i wonder i wonder if we examined ourselves tonight do you remember where you met god i should remember i sure remember my experience i remember when i when i came to an understanding that there was a god and he loved me and wanted to save me and that he did save me and he come down and did something in my life and i knew that it wasn't just something that i was reading about but it was something real see you've got to come to a place where you meet god for yourself you have an experience just like abraham did and just like moses did and just like paul did and just like david did and all the ones that you read about in the bible is fine to read about it but you do you know god for yourself i'm not talking about where you just come to church and go through the motions but have you fallen in love with god where you're not doing it because somebody screamed and yelled you but because you love god to where you're anchored in christ paul said in hebrews chapter 6 that by two and we're getting to this in sunday school by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to take to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul and that hope is an anchor two immutable things that a god that cannot lie would make a promise that a god that there's no there's no falsehood in him and that god will make a promise that who who is who i justify you're going to be glorified and make a promise that if you'll believe my words you're going to be saved and make a promise that he's going to take you to the end of the road and that's the anchor of our soul the hope that we hold that anchors our life and brother evan said it's just like a ship a ship has an absolute and that ship's absolute is the anchor and there the ship has an absolute it's anchored waves might toss it about but still that ship can stand just perfectly still where it's anchored because it's an absolute to it and if christ is your absolute you're tied to him in that manner no matter what anybody says how hard the persecution gets how bad the storm seems to be you're anchored it doesn't matter what everybody's opinion is it doesn't matter what the world says it doesn't matter what people at school say because you're anchored in him it doesn't matter what your boss says how it looks for it to be how it looks impossible for it to happen it doesn't matter what the doctor says because you're anchored in him we've got that hope of those two immutable things that a god that cannot lie made an oath a god that cannot lie gave us his word he said it he said it whatever he said is my anchor and brother brahma said if something has happened in you that christ becomes your absolute or any promise in the bible becomes your absolute if you're sick and you're praying for healing or something that comes to that strikes that promise in the bible i've got it there's nothing going to wave you from it you need an anchor an absolute that you know because churches will fail and people will fail church opinions about churches will fail thoughts about churches will fail people's opinions about themselves will fail people's doctrines will fail but christ cannot fail how do i know whether i'm right or not this tells whether we got the right absolute or not this tells this tales whether we got the right absolute or not this tells so you can open this up and look into the mirror of god's word and see whether you're tied to it or not he said if you could read in that scripture something that christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because of some twisting around and someone would tell you that was for the disciples or someone else and then you don't hold on to that then christ is not your your absolute that person who led you out of the way is your absolute see that's why you hear you hear somebody at school you you hear your teacher saying there's no right or wrong there's no truth you hear your friend that girl that yeah at school that you really like that you think she looks real pretty or something and and you want to listen to her but that's that's something that's a tie post that'll lead you astray that'll unravel itself that'll lead you down into the gutter like solomon would say lead you into the pit or you want to get some wisdom go read what solomon would have to say about things like that some a a girl that that would lead you away and she becomes the mouth of hell and all those things you you can't tie yourself to those things you don't see brother i'm saying you you say you must get that absolute that's something that's real that identifies you with christ in his word and the word is christ and you must be sure that you can say amen to that word or your absolute is wrong see your whole identity your id the world doesn't know what their identity is they don't even know whether they're a man or a woman or what what they like or what they don't like or what's true or not or whether that trash can is god or not but your identity your whole identity is in his word you know what identity is the set and qual of qualities and beliefs that make one person a group different from others see your name is what makes you different our name is jesus christ miss jesus christ your name is what makes you different your background is make diff what makes you different the the history of your life as a christian where you come from and where you're going and your goals all that is your identity your goals is what makes you separate from the world your goals is not your goal is not to look like the world or act like the world but to be a christian to be a christian that's what separates you my family this just come to me my family we went a little kayaking trip with the family and we got all the kayaks in the water and we went on a nice little little outing and we came back and on the back of my van i've got that cloud the jeez with the picture of jesus it seems like every time we go kayak and every time i come back somebody wrote something nasty on the back there was some some uh some some dirt on the back of the van and they somebody had written uh something up i i forget exactly what what it was but something about whether or not homosexuality is right god loves everybody like god loves gays and all this kind of stuff and you see because you you put that picture of jesus you identify yourself with christ and you're different and it it's going to cause a reaction because you you you let's just listen to those people that we heard in that video the world is going to think that you're different and it's not because there's something wrong with you it's because there's something wrong with the world if you've got the holy ghost tonight you're the only ones that are in your right mind now to think about that you become jesus was the light of the world when he was on the earth but now you are the light of the world because christ that same christ is living in you and wherever you go you're a testament to the to the insanity of the world a world that doesn't know what's right or wrong that doesn't know what's black or white it doesn't know what's true or false but you are a living witness a living testament of what's right because you've got that holy ghost and the holy ghost brother said the holy ghost in you is like a compass that only points to the word just like the compass only points to the north star the north star that's unmoving the north star that is unchanging in the sky and the holy ghost in you always will take you back to the word he said you can't look up here and say this is shine and this star shines here and after a while it shines somewhere else see you've got to get somewhere where it's absolutely established and that's what the holy ghost does and you're down in your soul it's established that it knows where the north star is it knows what it's anchored to that it's anchored to this word there must be an absolute in your life you've got to have it somewhere and every one of you has got one you can't go on without one you've got to have an absolute now he would say there was a time when germany when germany when adolf hitler was an absolute in germany now what did that mean with that adolf hitler was an absolute no matter what anybody said hitler was the last word if anybody come to him if if i was actually reading the history of where where people would would have opinions different from hitler and hitler bring them up for execution and they would they would come up with all their different excuses and things well well i didn't know you were going to kill me i didn't know this and that but all their excuses and their opinions didn't matter because he was the absolute and when they came you see he was the one that determined who lived or died who was promoted or demoted he was the absolute you come up to him and his word was the final word that's what the absolute is mussolini was the absolute in in his day all those italian black shirts they had they actually had a motto if you go back and read the history of the italian black shirts that would go around and arrest you if you had an idea different from mussolini and it was it was really really horrible i certainly can't say it from behind the pulpit but the gist of it was was we don't care about you we don't care that was their motto so you come up with all your excuses and all your schemes and all your opinions and it didn't matter because mussolini was the final authority he was the absolute brother i'm going to talk about now this is funny he would talk about that was a woman's word that she had there was this lady that used to write in the newspapers called emily post and her word was at the absolute on how you should act at weddings and how you should act at the table how which fork you should use and which spoon you you should use and how you should act at funerals what kind of cloak whether you should wear white or black at funerals and we know you accordingly post you're supposed to wear black at funerals you're not supposed to wear white at a wedding except for the for the bride and all this stuff came from emily post who was the absolute so if you had any any qualms or any disagreements or any opinions about table manners or what spoon you're supposed to use you got to take it back to emily post because she was the absolute she was the final authority you know my wife's family they came from romania when chaucesky was ruler and he was the absolute they got all these stories about he would say give me your cow and you got to give him your cow give me your give me your crops you got to give him your crops because he was the absolute and if you disagreed with him well he'd have you thrown in prison because his word was the final authority and it didn't matter what your opinion is you see what i'm getting at it this afternoon it doesn't matter what our opinions are we we think so many times that our opinions are so great and we will argue with our mom and dad or whether our co or whether different people at church or whatever and we think that that we know what it's all about but you see ultimately your opinion doesn't matter you got to find something that you can base everything on you got to go back to a foundation not just some tree that you lay your hands on and say i believe i'm going to be healed but it's got to go back to a foundation it's got to go back to something real and that's what truth is something real something real not just some trash can or something where well i think that might be god or or whatever but it's something it's the real thing it's real real there was a time when pharaoh was the absolute of egypt and whatever pharaoh said had to be done but you know you know now if you want to go find out what happened to pharaoh you got to go out into the desert and you got to go dig down in the ground you got to dig 20 feet in the ground to find out where their throne was because it was not a firm foundation now they're all covered up with dust and i went we went to the museum one time to see i think it was ramsey's mummy when it was touring and we were i stood there and looked at his at his mummy and his face his nose had all fallen in and he looked all decayed and to think that once upon a time that was a great pharaoh that set up on the throne and he was the one that doled out punishment and said you're going to live and you're going to die but now his nose is caving in and we're standing around with all our kids and strollers and stuff looking at him thinking wow look at that you see you say what kind of an absolute is that something we think we think things are so great here that we can look we think we're we're so great but but there he was in a museum behind place of glass and all these people were crowding in paying fifty dollars each or however much it wasn't to get in and listening to a little audio recorder telling about ramses and that's all that his life amounted to was people that he never would have thought looking at him looking at his decayed corpse listening to an audio recorder you got to dig 20 feet in the ground to find where their thrones was is what brother ram said it's perished and gone and the people that relied upon that kind of an absolute they are perished with it and gone on it was man-made and anything that's man-made will perish with man but there is an absolute they cannot perish and that's the eternal word of god pharaoh comparison mussolini they hung upside down in the street after they shot him josh kiskew what they did something similar with him i forget what happened shot him they shot him and all these but you see there's that's an absolute that perishes but we've got an eternal word of god that will never die it can never perish you stay with it you got to have an absolute in everything you do you know you think about all this all this stuff in the news lately about roe versus wade how the supreme court's going to going to reverse that and how they take it all the way up to the the highest court in the land but you see the supreme court is the absolute so whatever the supreme court says that's the final say you say well i i don't i disagree with that i don't i don't like their opinion and see our opinions if you go if you would go to stand in front of those nine supreme court supreme court justices it wouldn't matter to them because they'd say our law is final and because as far as the united states laws go the supreme court is final and brother adam said they we got an absolute here we go out and have a trial and you get into trouble and you have a trial here in the city they can take it up through other courts and so forth it might finally come to the supreme court but the supreme court's decision is the absolute that's the end of trials that's all the further you can go that's the last court it's the supreme court and that's an absolute i was looking up all these controversial opinions of the supreme court decisions of the supreme court brown versus board of education plessy versus ferguson all these dred scott versus sam dredd scott you all remember that dread the dread case where the supreme court said that if you're african-american you don't even have a right to be a united states citizen but that was a decision of the supreme court at the time and you could say well my opinions are different but it's the supreme court the supreme court all the roe versus suede bush versus gore if you all remember that supreme court decision bruce forced a score and everybody was divided over it but the supreme court decided and they made the decision and your opinion didn't matter when they made their decision giafalo versus washington was the last decision over the i think that was the the last election they made a decision over how the votes were going to be counted or something i i forget the details but the point is the point stands when the supreme court makes a decision you can argue until you're blue in the face but they're the absolute they're the final decision and brother brown said sometimes we don't agree with them or like their decisions but just the same it's the absolute because the nation is tied to it see what the supreme court says you see sometimes we don't like what the bible says but it's our absolute jezebel didn't like it in her day she wanted to wear all her makeup and flirt with jehu and all that stuff but yet elijah in that day representing the word of god was her absolute it don't matter what our opinions is you you got to have you got to have an absolute if i can get my word straight you got to have an absolute in everything you go down to the ball field and somebody i work with the other day that we went down to the atlanta braves and watched the ball game and they were sitting there and watching all the umpires and stuff and you know even in a ball game you got to have an absolute and that umpire is the is the absolute if if there's any decision now brother brown would say he said don't argue with him he's there he's the absolute in that ball game he's the absolute you said you can't argue with him not many people do you go to the the youth ball games and stuff and you see parents leaning over the fence yelling you can't throw my kid out you can't do that they argue until they're blue in the face but what good does it do in the end because the umpire is the absolute our umpire is the absolute and a ball a ball game can't operate right without an absolute and that's the umpire sometimes we don't like his decisions but it don't matter because he's the absolute well i don't like the way we have to dress and i don't like but you know if you line up with the word you can claim all these benefits there's a there's plenty of stuff to like in the word of god if you pay your tithes he rebuked the devourer if you if you become a christian you can claim the benefits package if you get that token you can hold it over your prayer and watch god answer your prayer watch god move on the scene for your family in your life if you've got that token to hold over your prayer watch things brother around said what if there was no umpire in the game what kind of a fuss would it be it would all be chaos that's why you need an absolute to bring order to chaos that's what the supreme court does is to bring order to chaos that's what the umpire does is to bring order to chaos if somebody slides into home plate and it looks like everybody's arguing over whether or not they were safe the umpire comes out and brings order to all that chaos and says this is that and declares what it is you couldn't play the game without having an absolute in it what about life it has to have a resting place and every moral here this afternoon has got your absolute somewhere your ultimate that's the last word an absolute brings order to chaos you go through traffic you know you ever come to it when the power goes out and you're trying to and it's raining you go to a stop light and and the and the lights are all blinking and it seems like madness trying to get to that stop light but the stop light is the absolute and that stop light brings order to the chaos if the stop light's working properly when it turns red you just know to stop because you're you're in you're in line with what that absolute is and you play hate behave what the absolute tells you to do and the program will say what if that red light don't work one would say i'll go here first and the other one will say i'm in a hurry to go to work and you talk about madness and talk about a traffic jam because without an absolute then you end up with what we just watched in that video with people running to and fro and getting depressed and having to be on all kinds of pills and antidepressants and not knowing what the meaning of life is and not knowing what they're supposed to be doing and whether they're boy or girl whether they like men or women and all kinds of chaos because whether or not without an absolute it's just a bunch of chaos there's got to be something that's right there's got to be something that's true there must be something there to say you go and you wait and so forth or we'd be all messed up we'd be all messed up without that christ is our absolute in john chapter 5 verse 24 he said verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life now that's something you can hang on everything on he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life if you hear that word and you've you've hung on to it until it become something real to you and you've got a personal relationship with jesus christ that's an anchor for the soul in john chapter 14 verse 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also in greater works than these shall he do there's an anchor there's an anchor that when you come to church if you believe that scripture you can have hands laid on you and devils cast out and and and healing in your body if you believe if you're anchored to that type post brother would say the reason we've got into there is because that every one of us make our own absolute what what's our absolute my viewpoint is right the way i see things is right my chi my children are right the way my children are doing things is right my family's right our own opinion my family my opinion and everything else is wrong sometimes you can even say well my church is right but all that stuff all that pales in comparison to this ass absolute i'm not i'm talking about this absolute something that's real brother brown will say each church has its absolute each group has its own absolute and they say each one of them say we are the truth the way we got it all you see when you start saying that you're treading on dangerous ground we got it all we know he's the one that's got it all we got it all you ain't got nothing to do with it brother ryan said you're in a minority you say we're the greatest group no he's the one that everything is based on we say we are the truth and the way but there's really only one way and christ is that way you see why the word the bible says the word will transform your mind will transform your thinking to from listening to all that junk out there in the world to where you realize you know if i'm born a girl i'm a girl if i'm born a man i'm a man i i get all that homosexual tommy right out of your mind get all that untruth and all that all that filth of the world out of your mind get under under subjection to the word of god and let it claim hold of your life let god have preeminence in your life and god will change you to where you're thinking is right the world don't know how to think they don't even know what's right or wrong but this bible will straighten up your thinking to where you're thinking right listen to what jesus said he said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me he's the only way listen it's bold these days to say buddhism and and of the muslim and all the different faiths the sikhs and the jains and everything else is wrong because we believe that there is a wrong and a right there is a right everybody is not right there is a right and jesus said i am the way the truth and the life he said i am the vine you are the branches he he made it he anchored it down so you have something to hang on to he said i am the living bread which came down from heaven i am the living bread if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give as my flesh which i will give for the life of the world he said as long as i'm in the world i'm the light of the world as long as i'm in the world i am the light of the world he said i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture he's making it real that there is a truth and he is that truth he said jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live you believe these statements it's going to make you weird to the world not because you act weird but because the word makes you just it's weird to the world he said i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman he said fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore and have the keys of hell and of death that's the hope that we have anchored our souls to i a hope that you can anchor everything onto and brother i'm saying you've got to have something that we could come to and say this is it and it can be proven that's it that's what it is see him how is it proven it's vindicated vindicated by signs and wonder you can you can just look young people you can look at the lives of your mother and father and see how god has changed them see how they act different than than the way that they talk about how they used to be you can look around you and see the miracles that have been brought wrought right here in our midst of people being healed of uh you talk about brother ryan's daughter that's been healed of the epilepsy and and you could go down the list of all the different ones of sister regina that that problem with her with her throat she was healed of and paul that was raised up from his sick bed in the hospital when he had covered you go down the list of all the ones that have been touched by the hand of an almighty god but why because we've been we've been anchored we've been tied into the benefits you know god is real he there is a real god we were talking to coming up that we were just talking to somebody that was talking about their aunt that was sitting in a meeting i'm gonna share this and she said she looked over and she saw on the end of the pew and angel sitting there and the angel was listening to the preacher and nobody knew that that angel was sitting there and after a while the angel got up and walked down the aisle and she was watching this and he sat down next to the piano player now you think what what would you do if you saw that i sat down next to the piano player and watched her play the piano and she saw and you see listen how many times are there angels in our midst and we're unaware because we've just become we've gotten it it's become common to us and we've become and now we're not enthralled with the word anymore and it's not we're more entertained by what we watch on tv and stuff than something that will anchor our souls that will give us life and you think that that angels are in our midst right now they're they're in our why why we know that they're in our midst because the bible says that the angels of god and camp around those that fear him they actually camp out they camp out when you're home when you're in your prayer closet when you're driving to work they're camped out around you so you know if two or three gather together that he'll be in our midst that he's kept around here but we just our eyes are holding from actually seeing it but every once in a while you might bump into something and you feel something change something some emotion or something but god is real he's here and he's more real than all that junk that they feed you at school and all that trash that your friends try to tell you try to cram down your throat at school god is real there's an anchor for the soul that is real amen brother ram will say every man in his own sight say well now if i want to take the golden rule if i want to do this or some religion i believe my religion is do so and so and so and he'd say it's got to where it's like it was in the bible where it said every man just does as it was writing his own eyes where you just say well i go to sunday school on sunday morning i keep the 10 commandments and i keep the sabbath day all that's good but if you haven't got something a little more than going to sunday school let me ask you this do you love god do you really love god or do you just kind of like like coming to church and kind of going through the motions are you really in love with god if you've fallen out of love with god it's time to go back to where you left him from and you can go back tonight to that spot where you left him from and fall back in love with him fall back where you where maybe you left him you left that prayer closet you left him alone you left that alone time with god where you get on your back porch with your coffee in the morning or in the evening time and you sit alone and talk to god it's time to go back and fall in love with god again everybody thinks well they just do what they think is right but that don't make it right in proverbs it says there's a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death what way would seem right to a man his own ideas and his own opinions the opinions of his fellows the opinions of his schoolmates and other teachers that have their own idea i remember when i was in school i had some teachers that would they would come up with some doozies i remember i had a teacher that would say she'd say who would want to live forever because some books she read listen i want eternal life i want to live and reign with christ forever i i see you listen to all that junk that teachers are put pop in your head and there's a way that seemeth right into a man but the end thereof are the ways of death but his word is life in john chapter 6 it said his is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet if nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life brother adam said the word has to abide in you if ye abide in me and christ and my word and you then how do we get into christ by baptism of the holy spirit then that's one part but then if you abide in me and then my words abide in you then you can ask what you will but you have to have both christ and word spirit and truth the oil and the meal and you really can't have one without the other because it's the self-same thing you got to have that absolute i know the hour's getting late but i got to finish this yo y'all hang on with me now he said you see we take we take something else for an absolute when dr davis come to me and wanted him to do he said a certain thing there that absolutely was unscripture what was that thing that dr davis wanted to do that back there at the baptist church he wanted him to ordain women preachers but that wasn't that wasn't in what he was anchored to and he said i am tied to the word let every man's word be a lie and mind be the truth that was his absolute if you're tied to that word god's word is first god is right his word is right others are not right he said we got so many ties one pulling this way and one that way and one against the other what we need is the full gospel planted in a full heart with a full power to bring a full absolute you know brother brown would talk about he said them old timers you look back at the old timer billy sunday and all the ones that brother brown that picture with hope where he would get on the street corner and play it play his instrument or what plays tambourine and stuff and he he had he was tied to something where he'd get out on that street corner he didn't care if people mocked him or threw threw tomatoes at him or whatever and he'd say the old-timers were tied to an absolute he said that's the way pentecost is today your mother and father would have had a spasm if they had thought you'd have god in this kind of condition that's what god wants us to do he wants us to be real men and women of god anchored to something real bold with the truth he said them old-timers are tied to that absolute and held onto that word regardless of what it was they walked in the spirit and went out and done miracles and performed things they had azusa street meetings going everywhere brush arbor meetings you can't even get me in on the street corner anymore to testify and paul was one of them old-timers and he was anchored to something real because he said none of these things move me not one of these things move me i don't care if they stone me to death i don't care if they lure me in a basket over the wall i don't have care if i have to go if i get bit by a snake and i have to throw it in the fire i don't care if all these things assail me none of these things move me because he was anchored he was anchored to his purpose god had a purpose for paul and what was his purpose to do his will to fulfill his will now i'm wrapping up here i i'm not i'm not really going to go along i'm not brother i said look look how look how much different this word is from stuff you get out in the world he's so much different from others i see this is brother brown's word he said always there's something pulling everywhere you go there's something pulling you in the world your teachers your all these ads you go to facebook or tick tock tick tocks a bunch of nonsense instagram all that stuff and all these ads are popping up and what are they doing they're pulling you this way and pulling you that pulling you to buy this and pulling you to do this and pulling you to buy this book pulling you to get this self-help book pulling you to this and that but in this here you pull nothing the only thing that's brought down on you it's the absolute and brother and would go on to say he said the new and old testament coincides with one another like a dovetail piece of board coming together well he's explaining how this is different it it all dovetails together it's not just something that's all these different lectures or philosophy many men wrote that book that 66 books of the bible they wrote it in a span of hundreds and hundreds of years apart one not knowing the other you can't make one word contradict the other one not one word in this bible contradicts the other one and that is a miracle that not one word from the time that job wrote his book to moses all the way down to john on the isle of patmos not one word out of place you put your heart right on god's word and heaven and heavens and earth will pass away but that never shall pass away that's the absolute the solid foundation that's my compass myself that's my god that's my light is upon that absolute of god's word i'm tied there eternally eternally with him by his grace i'm tied to him what are we tied to what's and i'm gonna close on this on this thought we're tied not just the letters on a page but we're tied to that pillar of fire the same pillar of fire that anchored moses you know brother brown would say when moses met that pillar of fire he talked to that in the burning bush he talked to it but then the fire came out of the burning bush and went in moses and moses got on fire enough that he went down he went down to conquer egypt with a little a little donkey and his wife and his little child and and no army behind behind him because he was on fire for god you think about what happened on the day of pentecost that pillar of fire the same pillar of fire that paul met the same pillar of fire that moses met went into those people on the day of pentecost why because because the bible says that he'll baptize that's what john said there's one that's going to baptize you with the holy ghost and fire now you see we we've got the picture of the pillar of fire on our wall and we talk about the pillar of fire but that's our identification that was brother brown's identification but we are identified with that pillar of fire too because that pillar of fire is the anointing of god it's the life of god it's the anchor of god the anchor to our soul that anchors us that we're tied to not just our intellectual conception of the word but the revealed christ moving among his people let me get to that quote brother brown said in questions and answers somebody said was the pillar of fire the son of man and he said no the pillar of fire is the anointing now you think about meditate on that is the pillar of fire the son of man and we know we've been taught it's been laid out to us the the son of man is the word the fullness of god back in flesh the fullness of god moving in flesh the pillar of fire is not the son of man the pillar of fire is the anointing he said now that pillar of fire is the logos that went out of god the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of god when god become into it i'm talking about our anchor now y'all don't get tired on me when i'm wrapping up this is the thing we're anchored to when god become into a form to where it could be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth it's condescending coming down god the father the logos that was up over israel he was holy could not bear sin there had to be a blood offering right and eden then that logos become flesh that pillar of fire come into flesh and dwelt among us and where this logos dwell in a human body which was the sacrifice now let's finish our thought and questions and answers number two where he said then watch the works of it it among us that pillar of fire the thing that paul was angry to the thing that went into moses and anchored him it among us proves the same jesus that once lived in palestine the same spirit was upon him has come up through a body until it's come back to headship again which is coming soon to claim the body the heads coming to the body you get it that will be the son of god the son of man the son of david the i am the rose of sharon the lily of the valley the morning star i am not he i am his servant and the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form which was upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of men i'm telling you that's an anchor now this with that same pillar of fire that anchored moses and that led the children of asia israel through the wilderness has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together don't you think we need an absolute don't you think we need something real maybe we could say it like this don't you think we got something real we got something that the world doesn't have we've got we've got the pillar of fire in our midst identifying us with the risen christ the musicians come forward that same pillar of fire is here our absolute our top hosts you think i've heard so many times people talk about well i wonder if christ is really doing something but you think about all the things that that pillar of fire has been doing in this church that that pillar of fire would take care of brother wade's blood pressure that pillar of fire would take care of terrence's keys and ryan's daughter's seizures and take care of sisters milk his brother laying in there in the hospital for two weeks and come out of the hospital take care of take care of paul there in the hospital with covet and would move on somebody's heart to get right where they want to be baptized and you'd never see so many people want to get baptized that's the effect of that same pillar of fire that led moses and paul you see god i want to assure you that god we've got an absolute and god is in our midst god is with us people let's rise to our feet and worship him we're anchored to that type host if you if you're not anchored to that top post tonight there's an opportunity for you oh you got to reach all you got to do is just reach out and believe him believe his word let's sing something and worship [Music] billers himself once 57 if he's as perfecter of my soul when trials and fears
