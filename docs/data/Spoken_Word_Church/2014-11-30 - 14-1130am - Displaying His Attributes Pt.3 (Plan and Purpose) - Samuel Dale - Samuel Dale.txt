like to turn in your scriptures turn to Matthew 9 19 remember the announcements now the bible study this coming Saturday at uh 6:00 come and be with us uh remember the Christmas time together December the 14th there'll be one service that day just in the morning for the our Christmas time together remember that and then remember the uh watch Night Service will be on the 31st first brother William Boran will be here speaking for us and there will be no service here on December the 24th because of the your Christmas time so remember that we're glad to have our visitors with us and we always say when you come here one time you're a visitor you're welcomed but if you come back twice you're just a part of us CU we don't have anything to join but they are from Brother Gabriel's Church I think up in Illinois but we're glad to have you with us today we went up uh Friday had a real good time uh with them in the services our on Friday night and so we pray that the Lord would bless is that all announcements uh what have I got oh uh on the watch Night Service now make sure you uh you know how we do we generally have services to start with like regular starting at 8:00 and then we we go to whatever the minister ministers and then we have singing testimonies Etc on up till midnight so remember that and have your songs ready your things you know that you're doing have everything uh in order so that will be able to do that all right Matthew 19 forgive me today if I have to blow and huff and puff but you know how that is he's sinus problems and things but you know we'll get through Matthew 19 verse three the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause now remember that and watch the scripture now and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them May and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh now he didn't say wives cuz he's getting over into the laying in order all right wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put a they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and to put her away and Jesus said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoo Marth her which is put away does commit adultery you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're not dealing with necessarily trying to minister about uh marriage and divorce Etc but trying to uh get some things in order to uh give us a better understanding now uh I wish you a lot of you had went with us Friday night and I condemn you for it because we went they had probably 200 people in a building then and there was no out of order things everything was in good shape and running good I really liked it I like their worship they came in came to the altar children from 5 years old and up they came to the Altar and they prayed before the service the men the women everybody comes to the altar they you know they're well uh trained and in all of that group there was no children hollering and screaming and problem going on it was real quiet we were kind of laughing about the deacons walked to sides and all and I told Terrence he'd have to straddle the seats over you know on each side here but you know we don't have that type of building but my point is uh you know we've got a lot of little children here and I've been able to say something for quite a while we've got a lot of little babies little kids all right now uh before you had those children you used to turn around and snarl and get upset cuz everybody else's kids was uh making a racket cuz it was disturbing you but you know after you get your own kids you just don't hear them something cuts off ton it you just don't pay attention to it you just kind of let it go you know but you know everybody else around there has not that way they're still turning around snarling their nose and and looking now I've tried to make myself clear babies crying doesn't bother me but crying for quite a bit take them out take care of them whatever the need is take care of them and quien them down we have a nursery for that that you can keep them in but just don't keep on letting them cry because you know and they're they're expected to say goo goo g d d you know we train them to do that but you know just don't let them disturb the people around you you know take them to the nursery take them out whatever you got to do with them you know we're still in the days I know they don't agree with it with the law but I still believe if you'll bring you a little switch you can correct a lot of problems you know and you just kind of do a little tapping and you know it kind of gets to it the other day they I had to go to the doctor and they gave me a couple of shots Well the lady gave me the shots in the wrong place I said it's not back there that's bothering me it's my throat you know but you know you can always just kind of get people's attention the little kids you know by tapping them just a little bit you know and you know don't let them play with things that make a racket you know you you get to Rattlers you get the paper rattling you get you know to do don't don't do that that distracts everybody around you you know we're supposed to be doing everything decently in an order all right and see that way then like I've always said I don't have trouble with the babies I have trouble with the adults that snarl up and do their things because you know that they're doing and well you can always move to the front and it's designed for the kids in the back that they're you know uh specifically stated for the children you know in the back and and let your kids be back there and and it doesn't bother everybody but see you're going to sit in your seat and snarl up and pout all all the way through the service and I can't hear well you're you're hindering the service more than the baby is am all right that's right I try to be decently and in order and put everything in the straight in the line you know to make it work out because we don't want to be distracting to everybody around us we want to be you know to where we can can enjoy the service and like I said we try to provide you a place you know and don't let the kids be playing with Rattlers and ERS and towing things and doing things take care of them because that's that's what you should be wanting to do you come to want to hear and you know and we didn't really come to church to hear the kids make a racket we come to enjoy the word of God and try to you know do and brother brandham said even a child running to the church between Services now listen he said would hinder the next service coming on now you say well boy is God that back well you talk to him I didn't say that your Prophet says it you know so you go talk to God about it if you if you think that you know thing so if you get your feelings hurt make sure just get them hurt at me if the deacons calm you down a little bit about it or call you down remember uh um I'm the one telling them what to do okay so we put it in that order just try to keep everything quiet as possible and try to worship and have a good time and all like that in in the Lord and don't try to hinder those that are around you I've warned you over and over brother randam said one person could cause the church to bitterly fail now you come in here with your petty little feelings and your little sorry the words sarus attitudes you know and do and sit down you're hindering the people around around you right that Spirit get is getting off of you onto other people and I've warned you over and over now that spirit is getting off on people around you all right and when it does it causes them to set and pout and spewed and you know well that's your business now you've been worned from the pull pit some of you have been approached personally and I'm telling you that's your responsibility that's between you and God I'm not going to a church with a bad attitude I just won't go I just won't go at all I'll just go off to myself and forget it cuz if I can't do nothing with my attitude then I need to be somewhere else praying right all right so I pray that you take that as a heart of love but if not take it as dirty owe me cuz we should be everything should be done decently in order and like I said I wish you would have been there we sat and looked around one baby said a few words and the Deacon got up and went around the baby didn't say no more I mean I thought we were supposed to be coming here to serve God Amen and to so you know now don't come in my office after a while and ask me am I talking about you because I'll say yes I'll just put a sign on the front door before you enter it says yes okay and let's prob solve the whole problem okay all right but now think about it what have we been talking about as I said we're not dealing with say marriage and divorce uh We've covered serieses on those before and things but we're talking about something that I believe is very uh needful for the time that we are are here and and the things to understand and and follow in the line of understanding to to uh help us to walk into the light that we see all right now we talked about the last couple of services that and we'll keep going through this that brother brandham says polygamy was permitted it was introduced into the human race and I ask you the question you know up front is why would it be the way that it is because Eve was the one that done the wrong see Eve had too many partners herself it wasn't Adam right now Adam he didn't have too many wives you know but you say well you know Eve didn't have well you argue all you want to I said Partners where you can just leave it alone but you see because of her doing what she done cuz we don't have to go through the serpent Seed doctrine we know what happened in the garden we know that you know Eve had a relationship with the Beast and those on the internet that don't know about that just remember what I've said every time remember I preach to my people if you're going to listen that's your business but don't call me up and want to fuss with me about because of something I say because I I preach what I believe to my people and you can sit and listen do what you want to you know or turn it off that's your choice but see why would it be that polygamy would be introduced you know what would be the uh the dealings when now and I gave the definition cuz the word polygamy can mean too many wives or can mean too many husbands so don't technically play with me on words I gave the definition because it does mean it that way uh you can say well it's bames it's Isam and no you get into all other kind of words I'm sure they got modern words today to bring up how many wives is too much or how many husbands is too much but I'm not educated enough to do that so I just stick with what you know the prophet has said in the Bible and try to use that terminology but didn't you ever think about it that because of Eve doing the wrong God permits polygamy to come into being all right I mean is that um as I said is that condemning the woman is it meaning that God is mad at her and she's done this wrong so he's mad at her so he's going to get out of her he's going to make her go into these polygamy you know to where that uh you know it would be permitted or what is it and I ask you the question we'll get around to it in just a minute uh if polygamy is what it is then now listen to the wording we know that the fall we'll get to God's plan and purpose in a minute you know to express his himself and to be a Healer a savior a redeemer Etc all right now because of the Fall those attributes can be displayed right all right because of the fall all right so we got it right now what Eve done wrong she done it and and God didn't make that happen remember we went through that God cannot make you sin and condemn you for being a sinner so he puts you on free moral agency to accept or reject all right so then Eve when she rejected she went into the wrong thing and when she did see then the wrong made an opportunity um maybe not good language but best I got uh it gave an opportunity for God to display his attributes all right which was his plan and purpose now what not his plan to make us fall now don't go that way see you're getting into the wrong Avenue if you think God made this happen no he knew it would happen right and he permitted it to happen to where that he could display his attrib then there's nothing wrong amen see it's lined up correctly in the word of God all right but then when it comes down see to the point that he has the ability to display his attributes why would polygamy be allowed permitted or whatever the words you want to use uh polygamy now listen carefully polygamy is not a display of God attributes you say yes it is cuz he don't no no no wait a minute now see you're making him the author so be careful now we'll get back to this in a minute but be careful see you say well polygamy displayed his attribute what what attribute did God display by allowing polygamy that's a simple question I'd like a simple answer polygamy cannot be the perfect will of God sin in the garden was not the perfect will of God am I right sin came because of their being put to where they were that he knew that if he put them that way that they would fall yes but he could not make them fall and condemn them for being wrong that's right you can't do that with God that's what your Prophet had to say all right but see then when you come to polygamy remember the reason polygamy is brought into being or allowed was as a type as a type now and a type is not a display of an attribute necessarily because you you start in a negative form of applying the type all right now so then if what Eve done wrong would would bring into being the attributes of God is savior healer etc etc or make a way that that would come into being then we must deal with polygamy as not a display of an attribute like a Healer a savior this or that or the other but as a type that would be there to display then his plan and purpose in its fullness are you with me yes you can say well I I like to display I like to well go ahead play your games you see I say these and then after a while I'll drop down and drive a nail and you miss the nail all right but I can't help that see polygamy was wrong right now why would it be that polygamy would fall into the animal race am I right the first polygamy was who Lage come over and had two wi and that's on over into Genesis a little bit no telling how many uh hundreds of years or whatever it took place to get it dire two years what's the difference lame was the first one that had two wives see Adam didn't have two wives no he chose to stay where he was at okay now we want to take Adam and make him into a type of Christ be real careful there because remember Adam went into the wrong now Christ don't go into the wrong to redeem us right did you catch the nail it just drove it down so you're setting with your own thoughts all right now so then let's talk about polygamy as being a type of God's plan and purpose because before the world he knew what he was going to do or he's not God is that true I mean that's that's sensible all right he knew if he made man put them on co-equal our free moral agency whatever words you want to use that they would go wrong but he could not now I keep emphasizing that because I know how the human mind cuts off I say something your mind cuts off it don't click back in till after while whose's mind clicked in I didn't get no amen right is your mind clicked in yet how about saying amen because that's the way we do oh no I can keep up with everything you say and I can write down everything you say I'm sorry we are not speed typist right that's right you write down notes just try just a little note don't try to write the whole sentence because you're going to lose what I'm saying that's right all right now clinch and nail is what I try to do and then to me yeah I just don't have nowhere else to go maybe you do and maybe you're thinking but when I see something to the positive point then that's clenching the nail and it's finished all right now polygamy was wrong and cannot be a display of his attributes now did that clinch that nail where a while ago you was thinking it could be his display of his attributes now the display of that's future savior healer deliverer all of that's covered that covers all of his doings except for one thing his plan and his purpose see his plan and his purpose was not to just be a Healer a redeemer you know that's not all of God's plan and purpose that's just a part that's we look at right that makes us into the wrong thoughts now we know these things but just in case go ahead brother and pull up just pull up number two because from Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother R said God had a three-fold purpose in his great mystery secret his great mystery secret that he had before the world begun he's got a three-fold purpose in it what was it first to express himself completely God in Christ all right there's your healer your savior your Redeemer your all and all second to have the preeminence by this in his church see amen which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them I like that till he could have he starts off he works it finally gets it we'll get to that in a moment all right now sin and death it's separated him from the his presence and his entire expression all right before the foundation of the world his expression was what his his his attributes what he was all right now when he displays his attributes you can't take an attribute I'm trying to drive that hard you you want to make an attribute to be something you know in doing it but to remember you cannot have sin as an attribute see so if God is the author of sin we might as well forget it and go home right because nobody's got a hope will join your Catholic church and kiss the Pope's toe and forget it you say you ought not talk like that why not it's the truth but to see that he will use something for his own benefit is a wonderful situation so it permitted man to fall and that way he could come in Christ to redeem be but before Christ would get here you know I'm talking about Jesus the flesh coming 2,000 years ago to die for our sins we see that his plan and his purpose was already beginning to unfold right and he permitted polygamy to enter the situation all right and in doing that he would set in motion something that would be a beautiful situation once it was finished but would take a long time 6,000 years to bring it forth and then polygamy would be allowed to be a type of Christ and his church all right so we see then David 700 wives right Solomon thousand but you know what not a one of those women could have another man there's no way you said well that would be a horrible situation to be married to a man had a thousand wiv he probably get to say hi to you about once every 3 years but I don't have nothing to do with it now don't misunderstand because God will allow things to happen that are not his perfect will amen all right but then he can turn around and take that permissive will right and make it his perfect will okay because it can all come out in the correct order all right that's number three go ahead brother Joe and then I never know who's on the pole back there to pull the levers so what did he say does God just change his mind about his word but if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will he let you walk in notice he permits it all right but he will make it work out for his glory in his perfect will now if you like just like in the beginning it was not God's perfect will for children to be born on the Earth through sex no sir God created Man Out of the Dust of the earth breathe the breath of life into him and he became a living Soul he took from that man a helpmate and made a wife to him that was God's first and original will now are you following me I emphasize those things that was God's first and original will what Adam and Eve is one children do not be born by sex right spiritual multiplication not by sex every how you want to run all your other things think about it but when sin come in and did the thing that he did that it did then he permitted man to marry a wife legally and have children by her multiply and replenish the Earth then if that's the way you're going to do it but you see it never was his perfect will all right it was not his perfect will for babies to be born by sex we use the word sex as a word meaning intercourse all right it was never meant to be that way it was meant to be and we'll get to that in a moment because that's what Jesus is referring back to when he says goes back to the beginning watch him he covers it to to make the point all right now to make sure you don't misunderstand me I put this on each way go ahead with number number four and then we'll get number five because we do not believe in polygamy yeah you out there anybody else believe what you want to but if you're that blind you're on your bed to hell anyway so go ahead enjoy yourself that's right because you don't have anything for your after that's right well now pgy was put there and show me where done away we will do that it was done away in Christ right or else you got a problem okay so watch what he says on the 70th week of Daniel preaching 61 806 in the Nations now you know what he's talking about he says in America we have more divorces Etc and and I read you one the other day where he said because we're trying to make people follow a Bible terminologies when it's the law of the land right see the law of the land allows all kind of things but we're trying to make it work by the Bible and you can't do that so he said in the Nations where polygamy was legal he said it's better off but then he makes his point in the Nations where they have polygamy is a thousand times better and yet polygamy is wrong we know all right see now we know it's wrong all right go to the next one this is taken from the the supernatural preaching 56 uh 129 and he's bringing in explaining Christianity doctrin outside the world coincide with Christian doctrine you can't put nature of a lamb the pig say polygamy be better off you may not believe it but God would look at polygamy and then excuse it a lot quicker than what he would that's pretty strong is it CU we all of our lives have been taught polygamy was wrong right and it's true it is wrong but what about a prophet saying things would be better in a nation with this thing but yet he makes his plain now remember don't you say that I believe in polygamy I don't all right now so then he doesn't believe in polygamy and not believing in it we don't believe in it but we didn't believe in it before we believe what he believed in it uh I never did like the idea of too many wies and I've never liked the idea the way that 99% of them are done because you got an old man with a whole bunch of young women now you don't have old women with a young man right that ought to let you know through the brain without going anywhere else that ought not have to be revealed to you you don't need a light bub to be turned on you don't see a 20-y old boy marrying a 40 year old woman unless she's Rich right all right but you see you say well well what about this that the other well what about it see because polygamy then would be wrong and the reason it would be wrong is because now we're talking about polygamy now we're not talking about it was permitted back there everybody understand me I told you last week we stayed in the Old Testament we're moving toward the New Testament now all right see then that polygamy was allowed to type Christ in the church true amen all right but now when you come to Christ in the church you see why the prophet would say we don't believe in polygamy why because you no longer need the type right come on Amen once you've reached the top you got tops and shadows you got type you got what is the word I always miss it is antitype which means a fulfillment of the type and one of them there you can go anti and other go anti and you got the wrong word what I mean by it is that you've got something typing it but when you reach the per the perfect wheel then you're no longer typing in that basis we will get to it in a minute that even a man and his wife is a type of Christ in the church but that's why we read the scripture yes sir it's not man and his wives today right that are a type of Christ in the church see you're going in the wrong direction all right but now think about it then when the church came into being on the day of Pentecost you had the Fulfillment of all of that that was spoke of by David Solomon the you know the different polygamy part and you had it fulfilled in the bride of Christ to be a many membered body right correct all right and in that many membered body you would have it not as many wives you have it as one wife right right now I hold that one wife because we can't say wives I know how people think amen I know what you're running on your computers out there on the outside listening in he just don't understand well I guess I don't but let's see if it's right and then I'm always open for understanding you know all right so once you reach the point of typing Christ in the church what would polygamy have to do with it once you reach typing Christ in the church there is something that we're holding yes that we go with this but holding it to the point because look what Paul Paul says go ahead with number 5 a look what Paul says you remember Paul's in the New Testament in case you know you say well you ought not be that carnal I'm carnal with a carnal you know I talked to a man one day and he said I don't know where brother brand said that or not I said hold on just a minute I'll get my computer running we find out well okay cuz he knew I could pull it up you but look look what he says in Ephesians now now this is Christ in the church for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall join unto his wives uh is that what it says it says wife one and they too not 4 10 12 20 amen and they too shall be one flesh right that's simple isn't it is to me and look what he says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church see once you reach Christ in the church you come to the the Fulfillment of the type case I use that word anti wrong you come to the Fulfillment of the type and you're no longer longer having to type you move to a beautiful type you move to one man and one woman amen right we're going to get with Jesus back in the beginning because he said that's where we're supposed to go right all right so then it's not many wives in the New Testament I gave you my definition just just the definition but brother brandham says Paul had a problem with marriage and divorce and he had to solve the problem right that's in the book marriage and divorce Moses had it Paul had it brother Rand you know all right and and and my honest I try to be that Paul wound up with probably some guy walking up there and said well Paul what I do I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior I'm a Christian I'm born again but what am I going to do with these Wes that I got because remember polygamy was still legal at that time now what would you do if you was Paul well go take your seven and live with them now where you going to type Christ in the church that's right oh well that's one man and many wives no Paul just said one wife one husband one flesh amen amen all right now I'll give you my definition which is I think it's a good one I think Paul turned around to the man and said hey look you pick out one of them women ever what it is if it's your first one or whatever it's doing that's legal make it right and you take her home with you but you put them other six over you in the building and you don't have no relationship with them and you feed them you clothe them you raise the kids you've got by them right if you want to be a Christian that's right now you give me a better definition than that right don't you go live with them we don't believe in the people that walk down the road you know got their houses all out but think about it now he leaves his father and mother he goes with his wife singular and they're one flesh amen because you're not typing now listen to wording it's impossible to have Solomon with a thousand wives and they're all was his one body now I know the top so don't argue with me about what I'm saying listen to what I'm saying sensibly he had a th women right that was was fulfilled and typing right but he could not be one with all of them right you say yeah he was no they had to be one with him that's right because they could not have another husband he could go have number 1142 right right right because it was legal so that's what I'm saying I clinch nails but you don't never see the nails okay one day it'll appear you said hey that's what he said okay so now think about it so we get to something that I love in a little way of understanding and I've always tried to explain this to you and uh you see by the new birth that came on the day of Pentecost the soul of that individual is made eternal you agree the soul is made Eternal by the new birth eternal life all right now in that Soul being made Eternal but it doesn't do away with our natural lives in what we've done that's where people can't follow that and you've never taught that because you were taught that just get to New Birth it takes care of everything cuz you was never worried about marriage and divorce right till you come in the message right you wasn't concerned about it you didn't have no thoughts about it you just you had somebody's opinion somebody's idea all right but you see the soul being Eternal but the body's not Eternal all right now follow a point with me see some of the things of the Old Testament still apply right there are some things of the Old Testament that still apply but remember my point now the new birth makes your soul Eternal it does not make your body nor your spirit Eternal right so we're going to have to deal with that as long as we're here all right well it don't make no difference what I do I'm born again okay go right ahead what are we doing here 50 years after the Prophet come that's one question I'd like to ask evidently it took a long time to get a lot of things straightened out that you know yourself what's in the message you see these men run off on their strange Doctrine they also run off with strange women and polygamy comes into view you think it's not in the message come on folks click on the internet and you'll find out I don't you listen to them and find out but now watch there's some things about the body that you're and I are going to have to deal with and I've always taught you because this is way I believe it I believe that the faith of the fathers what the apostles taught you know the Redemptive plan that Paul taught what happened in the garden and showing it and even showing the tops and the Shadows comes out to a perfect understanding of husband and wife right as now being a type of Christ in the church I will put this in here because I'm blunt not every man and woman is a type of Christ in the church because you can't have polygamy involved and still tring to type Christ in the church that's right you can't have one man now a whole bunch of wives or or one wife and a whole bunch of husbands it don't work we got to change things we're in the New Testament all right well what's our hopes our hopes is only in Jesus Christ right but now think about it the body we went out and done things wrong we married two or three times etc etc you know problems well do you think the new birth just automatically does away with that just it's just gone that's the form of organized religion and understanding and that's the form of a lot of people in this message that think the new birth takes care of the marital situation well why did Brother ROM preach marriage and divorce and declare Grace come on that's sensible I nailed a nail down but you didn't hear it but there are some things even though the new birth comes to the soul cuz I believe this message this message prophet's message the opening of the seals the things was to bring us to a bodily Redemption right the soul was Redeemed by the new birth all right you could heard you know you could have heard Jesus preach somewhere got born again out in under dominations and people don't think that's true but go read brother brandham put the dog over the egg and have C his egg forget it he said they could be you argue with him all right but you see there are some tail tale signs or whatever you want to call it what are we going to do with a situation of Paul with a guy that had seven wives you know what are you going to do you better study the message to find out some things but now there are some things that are left over from the Old Testament that are sometimes hard to understand now follow me if you think the new birth does away with all your marital problems I ask the simple question why do you need to Grace of marriage and divorce right that's sensable but you see I believe this message is to bring a bride to the place may not be but a handful right because most people are not going to understand it that's right but somebody's going to come to a place that there's going to be a bodily Redemption right right according to my Bible it hadn't been fulfilled yet according to me cuz I'm still here is that we're supposed to be changed in a moment a twinkle of an eye right that's right all right that hadn't taken place yet but see something's got to happen in what this message is for right sure brother brandham had to go back and preach over the Bible cuz he had to restore the faith of the fathers that's Miki 4 come on but then he says on spoken words original SE as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled right am I right amen amen that was what the Lord put on his pin R I believe Malachi 4 is just what the prophet said he he said his message begun in the seals the other was what was already in the Bible to be understood they understood the new birth Paul understood serpent seed he understood those things he understood the predestination the great things but yet he did not have the understanding of the Antichrist because he never called it that he called it Grievous wolves John on the aisle of patmas came back the only one called it the Antichrist in the Little John's but how much understanding did he have of an antichrist because brother Brown said he was flatly flabbergasted about it when he saw that white righteous church right right see brother randam is one that come to bring us to message of the Redemption of the body right because that's got to be done right that's why you have to have the grace of marriage and divorce right not only for natural we got to have it for Spiritual amen remember your spiritual fornication is what causes your natural right that's right right now but there's some things that you have to deal with go ahead number uh six and let's see if Paul knew something about some of these things from Romans 7 2 and 3 for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth the Bible but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of her husband amen that's right I me is that scriptural sensible she's bound to her husband as long as he live it there's no divorce for a woman right period I don't care what you want to argue about there is no divorce show it to me you can't do it a woman can't divorce her husband that's right right that's according to the scripture she's bound as long as he liveth all right but if the husband be dead then she's free to marry why cuz he's dead right it's ful sensible but this is what I like that most people don't never quote so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she she'll be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulis though she be married to another man but we don't put all the Bible together well her husband die she go marry anybody she wants to Now where's that in the Bible well say right tired but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she's no adulterous though she'd be married to another yeah okay Corinthians answers it Corinthians 7:39 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at Liberty to be married to whom she will listen only in the Lord amen now you got a different topic right she can't just marry anybody she wants to we'll get down to it he can't either that's what everybody thinks they think she can't but he can now I want the scripture where he can CU we're going to go through the scripture the only reason he can only in the Lord right you're not supposed to go out and marry unbelievers most all of us did most of us was unbelievers when we married unbelievers so I guess we just all wound up being unbelievers right but I still don't make it right and then I'd like a good definition of what un what Believers are because I I know churches in this message that you can't marry outside that building because if you do that' make you an unbeliever well you see what I mean you're not going to solve nothing with an argument of the brain you're only going to quote quote quote quote quote but what does the Bible say I just clenched the nail by the Apostle Paul amen the woman cannot marry again unless her husband be dead that's right see and I'm I'm sensible I know a brother one time that that U is you know his wife and and I'm sensible she put out with a law you know and tried to find her husband and you can go legally for so many years and you know I forgot seem like it's seven years you got to legally prove that you're dead or unknown of and then you can declare him dead I'm sensible you know I'm just not a but just make sure he's dead right you remember brother brandham on invisible Union don't hang him up in the closet right yeah okay but now think about it so let's prove the point with the prophet's message so we go to number seven and let's let the prophet answer this about the woman and her doings and this is off of the invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 151 the pl the Bible plainly says here that her husband must be dead not just put away he's got to be dead all right we got the prophet's message we got the Bible the nails clenched right there is no divorcement for a woman I have always been sensible try to be you don't have to live with a man that beats you you don't have to live with a man that's dirty to you mean to you you don't have to I'll go with you to the court and we'll get him in jail but you can't remarry well what I'll do is then you know I'll just take my gun and I'll shoot him and he's dead so now I can marry no you're a murderer so what have you done right I try to make it comical where it won't be so dry at a point but think about it the Bible says it the prophet says it that there's no way that she can remarry only if her husband be dead all right we'll get into that later with the type of Christ in the church Etc coming down Through the Ages all right now but we know that according to the Bible and according to the prophet the man can put his wife away and marry again there's where we s up but is it true all right so let's go to where Jesus went to start with and just let him explain that then we'll read what the prophet said as we did on the other so let's go to Matthew go to number 7A Matthew 5:32 but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving which means for any other reason the word except on the other one is the same form of word for any other reason see that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication now if he puts her away for any other reason than fornication look what he does he causes her to commit adultery now I'll give you where the Prophet said if you want it he said cuz she will marry again that's his definition on that right in the scripture say because she will marry again she ain't going to remain single H and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery then he goes to Matthew 19:9 and he says I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another commits adultery and who so Marth her which is put away does commit adultery now watch what it says whosoever shall put away wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another if he does it for any other reason then fornication he commits adultery no no she no no no you didn't read it and shall marry another committ us adultery right Bible's plain straight honest all right but now think about it except it be for fornication I had some things moved over so we'll have to cover a little bit and then I'll back up this afternoon back on it okay uh I have it in my notes so if you want it now that's where people argue over the word fornication and adultery that's the argument in the people of the message the people of the message accept the fact that you can put your wife away for fornication some do and marry again but others say you know well this or that or the other but they cannot interrelate the word fornication and adultery all right you know fornication is technically we'll read what the prophet said what is done by an unmarried girl and brother brandham said invisible Union and if you've been married to that woman for 10 years and she confesses that she was untrue to you before you married you have a legal right to put her away and marry again that's on invisible Union because she married you under false pretense that's why I Bor girls make sure you get things straight I've always been one thing in a pastor I have no right I know what a lot of people do because they're nosy may you smile there people are nosy preachers are nosy tell me all about it I won't tell nobody else until I get behind the building and I put it on Facebook but nobody won't read it right nosy bunch of old preachers the only thing I know that I have a right to do is what brother brandham did I think it was his brother Howard brought a couple to him he didn't know him from nowhere and I mean this is Brother random he's one said it and said they want to get married he said well the only question I ask them is either one of them ever been married before he said well no he said well go I I I'll do the wedding all right you come to me and say well me and so and so talking about getting married that's okay either one of you been married before either one of you been engaged cuz if you're engaged you're married that's what the prophet says in the Bible too so said all right now but I'm not going to ask you personal matters that's not between me and you to know how many times you kissed a boy or how many times you know problems developed because I have no right to ask who is a virgin you may think that's way you could do it but you explain it you're just a nosy old Doty so I say have either one of you ever been married before either one of you ever been engaged they say no I said okay as far as I'm concerned I'll do the wedding but you two better go home and sit down and talk this thing over some of you of here you know what I told you you go sit down and you talk over your life before because you don't want it to be coming up later in your life straighten it all up now and then you won't have to worry about it that's just me okay that's Pastor all right let's see fornication let's see if I can find that one I don't want to read it where people won't misunderstand me it's on questions and answers I'll find it you can see I got a lot of notes lay out here so maybe it's in my office but on question question and answers I'll be glad to give it for you where that brother R says they asked him a question what is the difference between adultery and fornication he said technically fornication is a girl that you know before marriage but he said the word can be used either way all right now I'd like for you to get in the Bible and run a little reference sometimes of how that God would talk about isra is in fornication and then he would talk about Israel in adultery and I got where he said that Eve committed adultery two tapes on it we got to it now Adam and Eve didn't live together had live together so that would have been fornication come on am I right right they were in the garden together but they had live together so it would have been fornication for the Beast first why brother brother say she committed adultery hey I'm sensible fornication is technically before marriage adultery is technically after marriage what did he put the Lutheran away for for committing adultery right he put away the Methodist for committing adultery it's an interchangeable word but we don't like it like that we want our definitions to control the situation but I want to drop back and just take the point where we were dealing with that her husband must be dead and it would be saying are except for fornication and deal with this a little bit about the new birth and just let you see something if the new birth does away with our marital problems some of you may believe that that's right that's your business but see I want it in the message and I want it in the Bible to where you can explain it uh well the new birth this new birth just took care of everything thing well now then why if it took care of everything now here's the nail if it took care of everything why is it left that the woman can't marry again you don't know you just got nailed to the wall well I see the new birth this takes care of everything the new birth starts a process that's right that when that new birth is completed in a change of the body then you can talk about the New Birth all right why would it be that if the new birth takes care of everything why can't a woman preach right come on but yet we we don't let them preach right CU we don't believe it's right and we don't let them just go out and get married again just because they got a new birth we're not Catholic that takes the salt remember sprinkles it on them sends them back and makes them virgins big man in this message one time said they said he spoke the word and put the virginity back in this woman I thought now there's got to be a quote there somewhere the Lord where's it at so I've clicked it and there it was brother R said that's a Catholic Doctrine he said they sprinkled salt on them turn around them send them back make them virgins I ain't that dumb you may be but I ain't that dumb I don't think it works that way right but you get the point what I'm saying yes why would it State he can divorce her but she can't divorce him if you're going to hold it that your new birth takes care of it that's right oh you just trapped your own s see you can't do that cuz see it would allow her to preach let me get another one did the prophet say Adam and Eve in the marriage and divorce was co-equal is that right right if your new birth does away with all of it then you be back to co-equal we'll review this this evening you wouldn't have no double Covenant that says he can but she can't that's right right you see what I me amen well I don't change me I know it a going to change a thought in your mind because you already got yourself christianized and you're going to go run around all over the church and tell everybody else how that you don't agree with brother Dale about this would just remember the one telling it the one listening both guil kissm and you will answer to that because that's what's keeping this church from operating according to the way it's supposed to be and I will remind you that one day years ago we had a little problem I got to whole church together and we prayed and I said we're going to get to aen out of the camp and you know the Ain left the camp see I'm Pastor sorry folks I have to be different the rest of y'all you know com it's throwing stones I got to throw stones even though I don't like like it but let's just read what Jesus had to say and think about what he was just saying from Matthew 19 go back to that one brother go back to Matthew 19 where we started at uh get the whole 19 go back to Matthew 19 go back to verse one or two two or three God I wants you to read it I want you to read it for yourself the Pharisees came unto him tempting him they didn't want to know what he's talking about they didn't believe what he talking about they didn't give a hoot what he's talking about they were tempting him they thought they were smarter that's right right you don't tempt unless you think you're stronger or smarter right okay and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause change that little word any cause any and ever would be the same right for any cause you know what he didn't argue with him I love that he didn't say you're a bunch of this and I can discern out your spirits tell you who you are and who you with last night I can do all these he didn't use none of his GI you don't think he couldn't have done it you don't think he could have put them everyone on the spot I can't believe he could he answered and said unto them have you not read that which he made at them at the beginning made them male and female two two not male and female males male and female two okay and he said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh now watch what he's doing he's simply taking the scriptures that they are supposed to know and letting them explain it in said for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh you know they say after you live together so long you start looking alike maybe that's why brother dick grows a beard I can go into scientific fact with you on that if you'd like I do read you become one right so cleav to his wife and they twine shall be one flesh Adam and Eve was one flesh do you agree where did the Flesh of Eve come from out of Adam so it's one flesh so he's saying go back to the beginning they said can we put our wife away for every cause cuz you see they had got to where that's what they were doing that's right why would they be saying that they'd got to where they were just putting them away for anything CU poor woman didn't have no problem I mean she didn't have nothing back there what she should do you remember the guy that his wife got raped he took her and cut her up in 12 pieces and sent her all over the country wasn't that something how could she help being raped that's he cut her up sent her all over the country made him SAR to come and help him woman in the Old Testament just didn't mean nothing that's what it come down to be and that's kind of way it is now you know the byproduct you know the by product when I've asked you to get the definition of it you won't do it CU byproduct means of equal value are greater and you don't read sorry they're not tne no more to one flesh what God therefore hath joined together let no man put us under brother brandham said he better not no matter if it's judge who he is he said he better not they say unto him see they're not through they didn't understand what he's talking about right I mean he nailed their hide to the wall and they're standing there that's my saying come oh Georgia slang there was no way they had anything to argue with right they said unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and put her away first off number one I would like for you to find in the Old Testament where he gave a writing of divorcement the way they wanted it the way they say it the only one you got is Deuteronomy 24:1 who would have ever known that Mo that Paul gave a Grace over in Corinthians when he said I say unto you not the Lord we didn't know that to brother randam come along we didn't know Moses gave a Grace that's right look they said why did Moses command to give writing a divorcement he told us we could do it for any cause he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so amen and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery he did it and whosoever Marth her which is put away does commit adultery but you know what that didn't straighten out their Doctrine they went right on doing what they wanted to do cuz that's the way we are we got it all figured out amen I I like what one brother told one time and he said it did he took a marriage and divorce book after you know he he wouldn't hear when brother Brown was alive but he took the marriage and divorce book and wrote on the book and said I'd like to ask him these questions you know wrote out his questions on the marriage divorce book he said one day the Lord spoke to him and said are you going to believe your ideas are you going to believe what my Prophet said you know I believe God spoke to him I to I said are you going to believe what your ideas or are you going to believe what the prophet said now where you going to stand right come on are you with me let me get one more scripture cuz I don't want to leave this dangling then we'll review go ahead with number number 7B no excuse me yeah 7B you can see by putting A's and B's in there I do a lot of rewriting I write sometimes a sermon 10 times forever for preaching I thought that's what we supposed to do on football fields wouldn't he played all these things before you ever get on the field well that's what I do here I kind of play them at home and then when I get through playing I'm not worried about what I'm talking about here okay look what he says in Galatians about this situation of your uh New Birth taking care of everything I want to emphasize that because see I know that dangles on in people's mind we was riding down the road one day and my brother-in-law he'd been married twice I know three times but we was going down the road he said ain't nobody tell me I ain't free to marry I said Well good I'm not going to say nothing cuz that's what he said he said ain't nobody can tell me that's whatever do you can't tell me I ain't right God spoke to me I'd be careful saying God spoke to me I'd make sure God spoke to me before that I'd say it right you notice I'll say something spoke to me probably the devil CU he can line the word up too he just don't believe it look but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school master that was the Old Testament to thing for ye are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for it as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ now watch him there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all are all one in Christ Jesus and in the kingdom in the kingdom of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is no male and female we're all female right because we're the body of Christ all right that's sensible so then if your new birth took care of everything look where you'd be you wouldn't be worried about a Jew nor a Greek you wouldn't be worried about Bond or free and you wouldn't be worried about male or female so everything be say h Glory Hallelujah let's just let go do what we're going to do let's have a good time we're going to have sister FR to preach next week that'd be good wouldn't it she gets through we'll let some of you other sisters CA it's neither male or female that's right there's neither male nor female in the body of Christ by the New Birth the soul is made Eternal right married to Christ become one with him and you explain how there could be seven billion people in the world today receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and every one of them would have the person quoting brother brandom the person of Jesus Christ in spirit form living in you right now can you explain that I'll be glad to listen to you 7 billion people could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost right but every one of them would be singular see and you wouldn't have the ruling things you wouldn't have Genesis 3:16 come on Brothers if you're right about your new birth and the things you wouldn't have Genesis 3:16 that he us to rule over her you'd be back co-equal right well you just said he needed a male and a female that's right so we don't even argue about whether they male or female but the same man that said there would no difference male and female at all one there wouldn't know male or female the same man said keep that woman out of that pull pit why she got certain stipulations against her come on she can't remarry she can't preach right but you see folks we want to just make things well brother d never thought about that I always thought because always been taught and you were took care of everything well if it does what do we need the message for you know what I mean why do we need the the message of the Prophet why do we need the grace of marriage and divorce if it's if it's all took care of he said well brother Dale I don't need the grace of marriage and divorce may I look you in the face and call you a liar sorry ever kissed a boy potential adultery you ever ask girl to marry you you married leaving all that aside what about spiritual fornication what about spiritual adultery every one of us was married to organized religion and I say upfront without backing off a word we are still bound to a degree to those the denominational husbands you may say no then what's your problem I don't have no problem I'm free how'd you get free come on folks it's time to straighten up line up let's get out of here we ain't got 40 more years come on what does the Bible say well that's just your way of saying it pull pits open because I want to be right you know it let me put this in where that some of you won't be here this evening but just remember Grace I don't care what you want to call it salvation Grace marriage and divorce Grace I don't care what you want to call it Grace is not for the future Grace is for the past that's true there is no such thing as Grace for the future that's a Catholic Church that gives you a right to go out and pay you money and then go kill somebody and you're not guilty amen there's no such thing Grace is for the past like I told somebody the other day about it they were talking about how the devil was beating them and condemning them I said why don't you just tell him the next time he tells you about your past why don't you tell him about his future because he's going to be destroyed amen and I said he won't like that let's stand what do we got 113 113 the world from you silver and and have to get along with just remember in his word how he feeds the little bird take your bird I don't have the voice to pull it up so forgive me I just have to go low enough leave it there leave it there just take
