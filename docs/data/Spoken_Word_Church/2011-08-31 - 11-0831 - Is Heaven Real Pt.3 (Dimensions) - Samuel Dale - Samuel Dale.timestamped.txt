[11:25] the Savior the Redeemer the all in all
[11:29] in Jesus is your name amen and amen you
[11:32] may be I mean excuse me say you may be
[11:35] SE Revelations let's read Revelations
[11:41] 21 we just read a couple of verses
[11:43] because there still remember now we're
[11:46] still up in heaven so uh remember these
[11:49] points Revelation 21 and I saw a new
[11:52] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[11:55] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[11:57] away and there there was no more sea and
[12:01] I John saw the holy city near Jerusalem
[12:03] coming down from God out of Heaven
[12:06] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[12:10] husband now let's go over and I'd like
[12:12] for you to read this with me
[12:14] because Matthew
[12:24] 6:9 let's all read it together because
[12:26] it's a very very fitting
[12:31] after this manner therefore pray ye Our
[12:35] Father which art in
[12:37] Heaven be thy name thy kingdom come thy
[12:42] will be done in earth as it is in heaven
[12:46] give us this day our daily bread and
[12:49] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[12:52] debors lead us not into temptation but
[12:56] Deliver Us from Evil for is the kingdom
[13:00] and the power and the glory
[13:02] forever amen you may be seated the Lord
[13:05] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[13:07] word now we've been
[13:11] covering for a while and we don't have a
[13:13] lot of just a few little quotes tonight
[13:16] because basically what I want to do is
[13:18] just couple cover couple of items and
[13:22] then uh the Lord will in Sunday we will
[13:24] begin to make our descent down out of
[13:27] heaven and uh you know
[13:29] coming down to Earth in our journey cuz
[13:32] we've been covering now for for quite a
[13:34] few
[13:35] services that you know talking about
[13:39] heaven Butz I believe heaven is real I
[13:43] believe it's a real place it's not just
[13:45] the thoughts as we used to say and the
[13:47] prophet said you know like Mama used to
[13:49] think and people used to teach that you
[13:51] know you get up to heaven one day and
[13:53] you'd just be floating on clouds and and
[13:55] you'd just be you know playing hars and
[13:58] and things like that I I don't believe
[14:01] that I I don't believe that's the way it
[14:04] is I believe that it's more to a real or
[14:08] reality than even the reality that we're
[14:11] think that we're living in all right
[14:13] we've been covering the dimensions and
[14:15] the things to try to see a little more
[14:18] about that and you know of the the like
[14:21] we're in the Life Light and matter our
[14:24] life like time you know matter we're in
[14:27] existence that we think is real and
[14:30] solids because we can stand on it and do
[14:33] things but my point has been to you is
[14:36] to get you to realize that wherever all
[14:39] of this came from would have to be more
[14:43] real than what this
[14:45] is then we're we're just into the basis
[14:48] of of scratching the service surface as
[14:51] we call it on trying to to understand
[14:55] about heaven now we we know for a sure
[15:01] that that it's a real place
[15:05] amen and God is real that's the two
[15:08] points that I've tried to make to you
[15:10] that God is real and Heaven Is Real it
[15:14] is not just a a uh an atmosphere even
[15:18] though we have to read that in the Bible
[15:19] and it does speak of a certain
[15:22] atmospheres uh speaks of things and it
[15:25] calls them Heaven you know but still
[15:29] there has to be a heaven as we gave it
[15:31] there uh Sunday the scriptures where
[15:33] that it talks of heavens of
[15:37] Heavens there's many
[15:40] heavens and and and all like that but
[15:43] yet my point is if there is one Heaven
[15:46] here that is like a dimension that we're
[15:48] in well then surely we ought to be able
[15:50] to understand that all of this had to
[15:53] come from
[15:54] somewhere you know we say well God just
[15:57] spoke it into existence
[15:59] well that's the point I'm trying to get
[16:01] you to to see that we look at God as
[16:05] being just a an object of worship you
[16:08] know and think about him as being well
[16:12] brother Dale he might just be some kind
[16:13] of a glob he might just be a a a pillar
[16:16] of fire of something floating by you
[16:18] know and and all like that well why
[16:20] would we want to think
[16:22] that why would we want to make ourselves
[16:25] greater
[16:27] than him
[16:29] right why wouldn't we want to realize
[16:31] realization that he's
[16:34] real and that heaven is real amen God
[16:37] lives in heaven you say well where is
[16:39] Heaven it's beyond the the atmospheric
[16:42] ways of man or thoughts or atmospheres
[16:45] and things up into the
[16:48] eternity that's what I was bringing out
[16:50] about the dimensions cuz you only have
[16:52] seven dimensions you have the light like
[16:55] life and matter you know then you have
[16:57] the fourth dimension which is like TV
[16:59] and and things like that are traveling
[17:01] in that Dimension and then you have the
[17:02] Fifth Dimension which is the sinner dead
[17:05] you know those that have died without
[17:07] Christ and then you have the sixth
[17:08] Dimension which is the souls under the
[17:11] altar which is all of the Christian dead
[17:13] in the place that they abod and then you
[17:15] have the seventh Dimension which would
[17:17] be where Jesus went to in his when he
[17:21] you know was death burial resurrection
[17:23] and made Eternal and went up and see
[17:26] then nobody had to approach to
[17:28] immortality
[17:30] except the Lord Jesus Christ all right
[17:33] so then there has to be a place that
[17:34] he's there as one laying on the throne
[17:38] see we don't talk about heaven as having
[17:40] a throne but read the book of Revelation
[17:42] read Revelation 4 5 and all through
[17:45] there and and read those things and look
[17:47] at what it's telling you about the the
[17:49] the the places and all but we know that
[17:53] as we look at it
[17:55] see we we realize that that is more real
[17:59] than we
[18:00] are and that's what I'm that's my point
[18:03] that's the the whole thing of the of the
[18:05] message
[18:07] tonight is to try to get it to our
[18:09] hearts and minds and then we will start
[18:11] with the the creation and and you know
[18:14] and bringing in the angels and etc etc
[18:16] by way of the prophet and start our
[18:19] journey down toward
[18:20] Earth but what have we' been trying to
[18:23] do is to tell you of the things that are
[18:25] in
[18:27] heaven and and seeing those things that
[18:30] are there and seeing how real they
[18:33] are and why wouldn't we want to go there
[18:37] right well you know we just we yeah yeah
[18:40] that's our ideas that's what we've been
[18:43] taught see and then what we've been
[18:45] taught has put us to the basis that that
[18:48] we don't comprehend
[18:50] reality what about in we're reading here
[18:52] in Revelations 21 cuz you go on and read
[18:55] the rest of the story and and you'll
[18:57] read it and find out that
[18:59] the future home or the city comes down
[19:04] out of heaven and settles on a redeemed
[19:07] earth right
[19:10] well why can't we believe
[19:13] that but see we we're wanting to do away
[19:15] with everything that's just like the
[19:17] people of the message when when they
[19:19] want to you know you talk to them and
[19:21] they say all God was he poured into
[19:23] Christ I know that's a quote amen and
[19:26] then say all Christ was he poured into
[19:29] the
[19:29] church well see that's that's a quote
[19:33] that's just like reading John 3:16 it's
[19:35] the Bible it's a quote but yet without
[19:39] understanding what is it right if all
[19:43] God was he poured into Christ and
[19:44] there's no God
[19:47] left he said that's not what they're
[19:49] saying well why what's the purpose of of
[19:52] everybody wanting to emphasize so much
[19:54] on on those
[19:57] statements could it be that they're
[19:59] trying to do away with God could it be
[20:01] that that's Satan's
[20:03] idea see his idea is to come up to be
[20:06] God remember that's what he wants to be
[20:08] as God right and then he literally
[20:11] becomes God to the people that's what
[20:13] he's wanting well to do that he's got to
[20:16] do away with God being
[20:18] real He makes himself
[20:20] real so then that the point I've been
[20:23] trying to make to you like and even like
[20:25] Revelations 19 where that Jesus comes
[20:27] riding back on bu horses and we ride
[20:30] they come down out of heaven right see
[20:32] like you the prophet said you know
[20:34] people say but but brother brandom there
[20:36] ain't no horses in heaven he said well
[20:38] according to Revelation 19 there is you
[20:41] know what would be our trouble it's
[20:44] because of what we've been
[20:46] taught grandma taught me this and I'm
[20:49] going to stay with what grandma taught
[20:51] me bless God well just stay with what
[20:54] grandma taught
[20:55] you but you'll never understand the
[20:58] Bible
[20:59] as it unfolds right you'll never see the
[21:02] truth of the reality of what to look at
[21:05] right but see in doing that then we we
[21:08] tried to make our I say we kept
[21:10] ourselves up up up back before the the
[21:14] beginning of anything before there were
[21:15] any molecules or or air or anything and
[21:20] looking back to see heaven and I tried
[21:22] to get it to you there Sunday I believe
[21:25] Heaven is so real I I'll make it to the
[21:28] point what I'm
[21:29] saying it never had a
[21:33] beginning I don't believe Heaven had a
[21:35] beginning you said well now you read the
[21:36] scripture where Heaven and Earth we'll
[21:37] get to that just a
[21:40] minute but see Heaven if it has a
[21:43] beginning it have to have an
[21:44] end why would you want to think it'd
[21:46] have a
[21:48] beginning that God would
[21:51] exist billions of billions of billions
[21:54] of trillions of years before ever
[21:57] anything ever was brought into being and
[22:00] he would exist in
[22:03] heaven or do you think he was just
[22:05] walking through the remember there was
[22:07] no
[22:08] iron that's what I'm trying to get you
[22:10] to
[22:13] see it wouldn't take our if we didn't
[22:16] have to have these problems with lungs
[22:18] and things you explain to
[22:21] me now you explain this one little thing
[22:24] to me how that a baby can go 9 months
[22:29] in the wound of a mother floating in
[22:31] water with water in its lungs water and
[22:33] everything about it all in it just
[22:35] floating there it's like a
[22:39] fish and then it's
[22:42] born and when it does it starts
[22:44] breathing well how come you can't put
[22:46] the baby back into the
[22:50] water you had drowned it because it's
[22:54] changed the
[22:55] situation of what it was and that's way
[22:58] God does and things he just changes it
[23:01] and makes it go right on down the
[23:03] line and see in doing it then we've
[23:06] tried to keep it to there I don't
[23:08] believe heaven was ever
[23:10] created
[23:11] right
[23:13] right I believe Heaven is eternal I
[23:17] believe it's a place to go to this as we
[23:21] talk about is just basically a a gap or
[23:25] whatever you want to call it in the
[23:27] eternity
[23:29] that would come into being about a world
[23:31] and the existence of mankind and thing
[23:33] would just be that up on Earth it
[23:35] wouldn't be a you know it certainly is
[23:38] not more real than heaven right but see
[23:41] I don't believe Heaven is a
[23:44] dimension now I'm just getting a few
[23:46] things out of the way where we can go on
[23:47] Sunday all
[23:48] right I don't believe Heaven is a
[23:50] dimension because a dimension has a
[23:52] signification about it of a position or
[23:55] place or something to remind you know uh
[23:59] uh uh this room is a a a there's so many
[24:03] dimensions you you so wide so long so so
[24:05] high you know Etc that's Dimensions
[24:09] right and see then there's seven
[24:12] dimensions but Seven's not Eternal right
[24:17] am so then where would you get the city
[24:20] coming down out of the seventh
[24:25] Dimension it would not be eternal you're
[24:28] eternal
[24:31] life is a number
[24:34] eight we've got to get to that because
[24:37] you know it was the Holy Ghost fell on
[24:38] the 50th or the number eight right all
[24:42] the babies were circumcised 8th day
[24:44] because of the top of the baptism of the
[24:46] Holy
[24:47] Ghost read the future
[24:50] home and see what the prophet is
[24:52] covering about those things and you'll
[24:54] see that heaven then is not a dimension
[24:57] right it was where all these Dimensions
[25:00] come from yes that's right they were
[25:04] created brought into being for a
[25:08] purpose and they never will be
[25:12] annihilated you said but now what are
[25:14] you going to do with The Fifth Dimension
[25:16] where the sin are dead you clean it up
[25:18] what's wrong with
[25:21] it you better remember that your soul
[25:23] one day was as black as
[25:25] Su and God cleaned it up
[25:30] right and made it a perfect a place to
[25:32] be
[25:34] used through the new birth all right see
[25:39] a dimension signifies like a cube or a
[25:41] space or a thing that we would have but
[25:45] whereas eternity would signify that it
[25:47] goes just as much one way as it goes the
[25:50] other way right up or down round or
[25:52] whatever it would never have any
[25:55] stopping place to
[25:57] it we see we look at it we say well you
[26:00] know well what did they
[26:02] breathe well until we come into this
[26:05] Dimension we didn't need the a we
[26:06] breathing that's what I was trying to
[26:08] explain about the
[26:10] baby whatever Dimension the people were
[26:12] in or or Angels or whatever you want to
[26:15] do or God or whatever whatever was there
[26:18] in
[26:19] heaven don't need no air like we need to
[26:24] breathe it would change things to bring
[26:26] it here what about the Eternal God
[26:30] coming from where that there was
[26:31] eternity but he had to step into
[26:34] time and become a time
[26:37] being he had to start
[26:39] breathing and start living that's just
[26:42] what I'm trying to get you to look at
[26:44] look at something in reality instead of
[26:46] looking at it like Mama's idea I'm not
[26:49] against Mama's idea but my Lord Mama
[26:51] used to think hell was eternal
[26:53] too she scare us to death with it you
[26:57] better straighten up you going to burn
[26:58] in hell eternally you take that away
[27:00] from a Baptist preacher and he ain't got
[27:02] nothing left right cuz he'll scare you
[27:06] and old brother M City Fred you over
[27:07] hell that wey you know hold you out
[27:10] there and dangle you and threaten you
[27:11] with hell and scare the people into
[27:13] trying to get the kids to come to the
[27:14] altar that's right what it wind up doing
[27:17] two-fold child of
[27:20] hell cuz the kids wind up being smart
[27:22] enough to find out that they didn't
[27:23] believe what Daddy and mom was talking
[27:27] about
[27:29] and and it changed
[27:31] things I'm just trying to get us to look
[27:34] at eternal
[27:36] life as a
[27:38] person a
[27:40] being and not look at it as just a
[27:43] raindrops of clouds or some zap of
[27:47] electricity that we would receive and
[27:49] say oh I got the Holy
[27:52] Ghost that's the baby after it gets
[27:56] here you got to get the L
[27:59] first see then everything can can deal
[28:02] in it all
[28:03] right see anything that's Eternal can
[28:06] never have a
[28:08] beginning so Heaven never had a
[28:11] beginning and it can never have an
[28:13] ending to it now what we speak of
[28:17] Heavens in these atmospheres and things
[28:20] that we're
[28:22] in it it can come into existence and
[28:26] exist and be called heaven
[28:29] but then when it goes out of existence
[28:31] it doesn't do away with
[28:34] it that's what I want you to
[28:36] see go we read there in Revelation
[28:39] 21 see that the first Heaven and the
[28:43] first
[28:44] Earth were passed
[28:47] away all right we read that like
[28:52] annihilated but your prophet got into
[28:54] the future home you know and picking
[28:56] that up and trying to show us the word
[28:59] of what it would would mean that it
[29:02] means change in
[29:03] form it doesn't mean annihilate that's
[29:07] right this world is not even annihilated
[29:10] it just changes in form you and I are
[29:13] not annihilated we just change in form
[29:16] we change from Mortal creatures to
[29:18] Immortal
[29:20] creatures it's not we got to throw our
[29:22] body down and go get us a new one that's
[29:24] right CU we don't believe in that we
[29:27] believe in this body being redeemed cuz
[29:30] if he's going to redeem it why is he
[29:31] going to kill it right you know what's
[29:34] he going to throw it away for but you
[29:37] see I gave you a couple of quotes so
[29:39] let's get on to this to just get them
[29:40] out of the way and uh you know so we'll
[29:44] we'll read a little bit and I didn't P
[29:45] these out cuz there's not enough of it
[29:47] to to I just gave a couple now if
[29:49] anybody can't read it from up here I got
[29:51] a couple ling up here all right so if
[29:53] you say I can't see it raise your hand
[29:56] one of the deacons will come and and I
[29:58] gave them to Brother Ray where he could
[29:59] read and sister Julie and where they
[30:02] could use but if you need it raise your
[30:04] hand one of the deacons will come up
[30:05] here and get these and give them to you
[30:07] cuz that's what we intend to do as we
[30:09] try to get along but now look what the
[30:11] prophet had to say about heaven you know
[30:15] Paul one day was speaking and he said
[30:17] that he was taken up to the third
[30:21] heaven taking up to the third heaven
[30:24] right all so now there must be three
[30:27] heavens
[30:30] right and see then doing that look what
[30:32] the prophet I gave you one showing you
[30:35] this way then we gave the future home I
[30:37] mean the uh the next coming up on the
[30:38] other uh one it'll be coming up but just
[30:41] to get this one which is paragraph 134
[30:43] uh the true Easter SE 61 402 and look
[30:46] what he says now we know that the Bible
[30:49] speaks of three
[30:51] heavens we know it we know it first
[30:54] Heaven second heaven third heaven I
[30:56] believe it was Paul that was caught up
[30:58] into the third heaven and seen things
[30:59] that wasn't expedient for him to speak
[31:01] of then now the first Heaven is called
[31:04] into scripture like the
[31:07] clouds now that's that's Heaven is
[31:11] referred to just like the
[31:12] clouds it's up in the heavens you walk
[31:15] out and you look up in the sky and you
[31:17] see the clouds you're just talking about
[31:19] heaven clouds all right so I'm giving
[31:21] you this part to look at you like the
[31:23] cloud in other words down below here on
[31:25] the Earthly seal now when that
[31:28] atmosphere from up and above the clouds
[31:30] becomes down into the church that's a
[31:33] Heavenly place then the second heaven is
[31:36] considered the solar
[31:38] system and the third heaven goes beyond
[31:41] that so now he shows you what he's
[31:43] saying anything down in here then you go
[31:45] up into the solar system you go up into
[31:47] where all the stars and the moons Etc
[31:50] and all of that is and you can cover
[31:52] that is the second heaven
[31:54] H but you see then he goes on to the
[31:58] next one and I like this one because he
[32:01] he he went to the message Satan's Eden
[32:04] paragraph
[32:08] 167 and look what he's covering he's
[32:10] talking about in my father's house and
[32:12] all like that and the economy in the
[32:13] streets of gold all the gr uh where that
[32:16] you would talk about over Revelation 21
[32:19] saw the city coming down look there was
[32:22] no more sea the first heaven and first
[32:24] Earth was passed away what was our first
[32:27] first
[32:29] Heavens was the
[32:33] Millennium what's the first Earth was
[32:37] this it'll be
[32:40] renovated all right now what is the
[32:43] first heaven or the Heaven and Earth
[32:46] that you know as we read in 21 that will
[32:48] pass
[32:49] away the millennial reign will come one
[32:52] day to the church you agree with that
[32:54] amen and that will be heaven ruling over
[32:59] Earth
[33:01] am so that will be called in the first
[33:06] heaven and when we get back to it on the
[33:08] earth and start coming through some of
[33:10] the thing it'll begin to develop a
[33:12] little picture in your mind that it was
[33:14] possible that brother brandham went to
[33:16] that sixth Dimension and he can call
[33:18] that sixth Dimension and wind up being
[33:20] talking about the Millennium so he may
[33:23] have entered the Millennium when he went
[33:24] beyond the curtain of
[33:26] time not trying to make no Doctrine out
[33:29] of it but just saying that he does cover
[33:31] a lot of things that we need to to maybe
[33:34] uh enter there end all right but look at
[33:37] the next one is off the future home I
[33:38] just wanted to bring this point out and
[33:41] it's paragraph
[33:42] 173 I
[33:45] guess he couldn't pronounce the word so
[33:48] he spelled it out you know and all
[33:51] because the word meant that the heavens
[33:53] and earth will pass away now this word
[33:56] means passing from from one form to
[34:01] another all right it says to another to
[34:06] pass from one condition to another
[34:09] condition all right so just don't do
[34:12] away with anything remember anything
[34:15] that God made was to be made for
[34:18] eternity except for one
[34:20] thing you know what that is hell was
[34:23] created for the devil and his
[34:26] angels and hell will have to be
[34:30] annihilated cuz it cannot be Eternal see
[34:33] we were talk that while we in organized
[34:35] religion right oh we're going to burn in
[34:37] hell eternity you better be scared you
[34:40] know don't you you don't want to go to
[34:41] that place you're going to burn
[34:42] eternally why you trying to scare the
[34:44] kids right or why you trying to scare
[34:47] the adults
[34:50] right the only way that you could burn
[34:52] eternally in hell is to put God's own
[34:55] life in
[34:56] there and then you'd have God living in
[34:59] Hell For
[35:02] Eternity see just simple little things
[35:04] that we should have thought about and
[35:07] should keep in our
[35:09] thinking but to think about see that
[35:13] hell was made for the devil and his
[35:14] angels but there's things that will
[35:17] change in form as we go
[35:20] along there's going to be a millennial
[35:23] Reign for a thousand
[35:24] years but at the end of that Millennial
[35:27] reign
[35:29] which will be Heaven ruling over
[35:32] Earth see then it will be changed Satan
[35:35] is lose for a little
[35:37] season and you go forth and you have go
[35:39] and Magog which will be a final battle
[35:42] to destroy all things even demons and
[35:45] stuff like that will be
[35:49] annihilated anything that's not Eternal
[35:53] will have to face an existence after
[35:55] white drone judgment and those that at
[35:57] the white Throne judgment it will be a
[35:59] decision at the white Throne whether or
[36:01] not to go into eternal life but the
[36:04] bride will be sitting on the throne with
[36:06] him because he's already been made
[36:08] Eternal here and goes
[36:10] up see we're just trying to get into
[36:12] these things to see where we're going to
[36:15] where are we going when we leave
[36:18] here well it don't matter to I know it
[36:20] I've been through that now just don't
[36:22] even get on to that garbage can with me
[36:24] I've been through the Baptist and you
[36:26] have to and all of your other Church
[36:28] well it don't matter about all knowing
[36:29] about all this stuff where we're going I
[36:31] just want to go
[36:33] there right you know what everybody says
[36:37] what does it matter what we
[36:40] know I just want to be there I just want
[36:43] to know about
[36:45] Jesus I'm not not making no lie to
[36:47] nobody I'm telling it like it is cuz you
[36:50] see I'm talking about
[36:54] Jesus I'm talking about eternal life
[36:58] right amen there can't be a false Jesus
[37:01] with a false
[37:02] word and a trinitarian
[37:06] concept and a good little God that loves
[37:09] everybody you know and all these angels
[37:13] floating around whether they male or
[37:14] female they don't care they just put
[37:16] them in on Christmas now you know and
[37:18] got all them glorious sitting down there
[37:19] with them and they got now they got Mary
[37:22] is in the upper room with the Lord
[37:26] Jesus
[37:28] they got all kind of things going CU
[37:31] it's man's
[37:33] ideas amen but I'm talking about eternal
[37:38] life I'm talking about something to
[37:41] where that we come to a place to where
[37:44] that we can see that there has been
[37:45] things happening and are still
[37:50] happening to where that we can see that
[37:53] God is
[37:54] real and that everything was you know
[37:59] real and we go back though see we've
[38:01] been trained we've heard the prophet say
[38:03] it and the preachers preach it that way
[38:05] it's just in his
[38:08] mind you remember I spent a couple of
[38:10] messages trying to to to help our
[38:13] understanding along that
[38:15] line that God's thoughts are Eternal
[38:18] that he can never have a new thought he
[38:21] can't thank of something one day and
[38:22] think of something better the next day
[38:24] am he wouldn't be God see and we we we
[38:29] think we know all about the the the
[38:31] things and we just wind up being
[38:35] quoters instead of possessors of what
[38:37] we're talking
[38:39] about all right I've always told you
[38:43] Judas is car it was in God's mind yeah
[38:48] right but I don't want to be there that
[38:50] way right right so I con the phrase
[38:53] about probably 30 years ago and been
[38:56] trying my best to get you to to hang on
[38:58] to the phrase that I don't want to be in
[39:00] God's mind I want to be a part of God's
[39:04] mind I want the mind of Christ inside of
[39:08] me cuz that's what the Bible said it
[39:10] would make me a new Creature if I had it
[39:12] inside of me I want eternal life I don't
[39:15] want just a thought about something or a
[39:17] raindrop or or anything that you say
[39:20] that's my new birth no that would have
[39:22] to be the after
[39:23] effects get the new birth all right
[39:27] so if you say well it's just in the mind
[39:29] of God brother brand said 49 Church age
[39:32] book I didn't bring this
[39:33] one he said it's not like
[39:37] somebody with a blueprint draw
[39:40] out that will one day be made
[39:43] substance you know brother Gary he'll go
[39:46] down and look at a place somebody wants
[39:47] to build him a house and he'll go out
[39:49] and he'll he'll get a man to draw him
[39:51] out of
[39:52] blueprint well the man can walk up and
[39:54] he said here's your
[39:56] house
[39:59] the guy said I'd like to see it about 3
[40:01] months later if you don't
[40:03] mind no here's your house pay me you
[40:08] agreed to pay me when I give you the
[40:09] house there your
[40:11] house we know better than that now don't
[40:14] we that wouldn't quite
[40:17] work the man was paying him to build him
[40:19] a
[40:21] house all right something to bring into
[40:24] reality right but that's from a
[40:26] blueprint print that somebody's drawn
[40:28] right God never had a blueprint he is
[40:32] the
[40:33] blueprint he doesn't need a
[40:36] blueprint we're over here in Banks
[40:38] County a poor truction of the world and
[40:41] and you can't go over there and get a
[40:42] book to tell you how to build a
[40:44] house because the inspector will tell
[40:48] you and if he don't like the way you do
[40:50] it he'll tell you he don't like that
[40:53] you'll build it according to his
[40:55] standards and see you can't say back in
[40:57] Hall County you can go up to Hall County
[40:59] and you get the big old thick book it
[41:01] lays down tells you everything you don't
[41:02] have to worry long as you build it
[41:04] according to the book it's all right but
[41:06] Banks County don't have it well see God
[41:09] don't have no
[41:11] standard he knows what he
[41:14] wants he's not trying to make it take
[41:17] place as far as he's concerned it's
[41:20] already taken place
[41:23] right that's what I want to get on for
[41:25] just a few minutes tonight
[41:28] that we we covered this but I just want
[41:30] to get on to a point according to
[41:32] Revelations
[41:34] 13:8 it said all
[41:36] who names were not written in the loue
[41:39] Book of Life from the foundation of
[41:42] world will be
[41:44] deceived right now what is that name
[41:47] we've covered it but what is that name I
[41:49] just want to tie it together with a
[41:50] Redemption just just talk to you a
[41:52] little tonight about this and then we'll
[41:54] try to get this out of the way and get
[41:55] down to earth so we're trying to tie it
[41:57] together with
[41:58] Redemption so what
[42:01] about what was written in the book of
[42:06] life you know that in the bible really
[42:08] there's nothing but
[42:10] names well what do you mean I here's
[42:13] this we read about this we that's
[42:15] telling you what took place around when
[42:18] that name was
[42:20] here it's really a book of
[42:22] names it wasn't a scoffield or a
[42:25] Thompson Chain or or whatever ever that
[42:27] fell in the
[42:30] garden it was a book of
[42:34] names when Adam and Eve couldn't bring
[42:37] it forth the book had to go back to the
[42:39] hand of the one that sit on the throne
[42:41] you find it in Revelations 4 and 5
[42:45] right it's a book of
[42:48] names why because it's there's two
[42:50] sections of it we'll cover it when we
[42:51] get down to earth and start on it
[42:53] there's a section of it that's called
[42:55] The Book of
[42:56] Life and all names will be written in
[42:58] there but then there's a section called
[43:00] The lon's Book of Life that only the
[43:03] bride will be listed in the Lamb's Book
[43:05] of
[43:07] Life but what about that
[43:13] name all right let's read a few of them
[43:15] and then we'll just read these three
[43:16] right here is all we use
[43:18] tonight so let's read number four which
[43:21] is hear ye him
[43:23] 1956
[43:26] 92930
[43:29] 1956 paragraph 12 look what he says so
[43:34] God before the foundation of the world
[43:36] knew that we would be here he knew you
[43:40] by name before the foundation of the
[43:41] world think of it and many times we sing
[43:44] the song new name written down in glory
[43:48] tonight it was an
[43:51] ERA that's right it was written down
[43:55] before there was ever a human on the
[43:58] earth what your name was written down
[44:01] before there was ever human being on
[44:03] Earth your names are written in the Lou
[44:04] book of life amen think of it the Bible
[44:07] said that Jesus was the lamb slain
[44:09] before the foundation of the world
[44:11] taking 4,000 years for that to
[44:14] materialize 4,000 years later he was
[44:16] actually slain but when God spoke the
[44:19] word in the beginning he was slain right
[44:21] then because word God's word Can't Fail
[44:24] You See amen there's not a new name
[44:28] they got the song you know there's a new
[44:29] name written down in glory and it's mine
[44:31] it's
[44:32] mine it sounds good and beautiful but
[44:35] it's not
[44:36] scripture there's no such thing as
[44:39] writing down there it was written before
[44:40] the foundation of world or will never be
[44:43] written see we want to argue that point
[44:46] there well well you know that's all
[44:48] right it's a good song all right it's a
[44:50] good
[44:51] song what good is a good
[44:54] song right
[44:57] if there ain't some words on there that
[44:59] don't sound good and tell you something
[45:03] there's a lot of good songs out there
[45:05] that sounds beautiful but then you
[45:07] analyze the words go get your Beatles
[45:10] and sing some of them and and think
[45:12] about Jesus Christ and Mary and there
[45:14] what they're singing took
[45:19] place all never listen to them just
[45:25] read cuz never did care nothing about
[45:27] none of it but look at the next
[45:31] one paragraph 70 of the serpent seed
[45:34] 1958 9:28 the evening
[45:38] service he said the man talking about
[45:40] who wrote the song There was a new name
[45:42] written down in glory tonight in its
[45:44] mind his idea was all right but he was
[45:46] wrong scripturally your name wasn't put
[45:49] on the on the night you got saved your
[45:52] name according to the B according to the
[45:54] Bible according to Revelations 3 137
[45:58] 1317 I think it really go at 138 but and
[46:02] so forth was put on there before the
[46:04] world ever begun and Jesus Christ was
[46:07] slain before the foundation of the
[46:11] world now Jesus Christ was slain you
[46:15] said that's only in the mind of
[46:21] God as far as God is concerned it was
[46:24] over
[46:25] with right yep am right amen amen far as
[46:30] God is concerned where was our names
[46:32] written now let's see what kind of a
[46:34] name it
[46:35] was page 211 pergam Church age which
[46:38] would be the church age book
[46:43] 211 and don't worry about it I know
[46:45] about the Overcomer and all of the names
[46:47] of the The Messengers and the Overcomers
[46:49] and I know that too but here's this one
[46:51] listen to it he is going to give the
[46:54] Overcomer a white stone an end not own
[46:57] the stone a new name which the owner Al
[47:00] knows now the idea of a new name is a
[47:03] familiar one Abraham was Abram was
[47:05] chained to Abraham Sarah to sah Jacob to
[47:08] Israel Simon to Peter Saul to Paul these
[47:11] names either brought about a change or
[47:13] were given because of a change it was
[47:15] only after Abram and Sarah had their
[47:18] names Changed by the Lord that they were
[47:20] made ready to receive the coming son in
[47:23] Jacob's case he had to overcome and then
[47:25] he was called a prince in the case of
[47:28] Simon and Saul when they had received
[47:30] the Lord their their change came and
[47:33] today each one of us true Christian
[47:36] Believers have had a change in
[47:39] name we've already had a change in
[47:42] name what is it he tells you we're
[47:46] Christians right read we're
[47:50] Christians that's our new name
[47:52] Christians what do you mean we going to
[47:54] call everybody Christians well why not I
[47:57] thought that's what we
[47:59] are but look at
[48:01] it and today each one of us True
[48:04] Believers that had a change in name
[48:05] we're Christians it is a name common to
[48:08] all of
[48:09] us but one day we will have another
[48:13] change it will be of a certainty it
[48:16] change we will of a certainty receive a
[48:21] new name it could well be that name that
[48:25] was our true and
[48:27] original name written in the lounge Book
[48:29] of Life from the foundation of the
[48:34] world that's why my name is not Samuel
[48:37] in the
[48:41] Bible right my name is not
[48:46] Samuel but what name is written in the
[48:48] Book of Life the Lamb's Book of
[48:50] Life you're new
[48:55] name
[48:58] the name that was in the original
[49:03] right of
[49:07] when when
[49:09] god named his
[49:15] children see you're still not clicking
[49:19] with what I'm talking about
[49:23] at there was a day God named you right
[49:28] right you said well you're saying we was
[49:29] back there I done told you over and over
[49:31] and I do every service we wasn't back
[49:34] there as people we wouldn't back there
[49:35] as Souls we wouldn't back there as
[49:38] identities we were in
[49:41] Christ the Bible we read and how many
[49:43] services do we preach there from
[49:45] Ephesians were that we're chosen in
[49:49] Jesus
[49:53] Christ and what is that name
[49:57] that was when you received your name
[50:01] right what is that
[50:05] name there's some other quotes that goes
[50:07] along with it where the Prophet would
[50:08] get down to to talking about that there
[50:11] will be a group of people that will
[50:13] receive a new
[50:15] name and Jesus will receive a new
[50:19] name to he be revealed in the Thunders
[50:21] and things but what am I trying to get
[50:24] to
[50:25] you
[50:27] there was a time your name was called in
[50:30] heaven right John may I quote the
[50:35] prophet John saw his name written in
[50:38] heaven now did he see
[50:44] John you know what I'm
[50:47] saying R didd see his original
[50:52] name which one is
[50:55] it my name Samuel has to do with my
[50:58] Earthly
[51:01] Journey sure natures and ways Etc go
[51:04] with your name well if you can see that
[51:07] I'm glad you thought of it if you can
[51:09] see that nature and ways goes with your
[51:11] name why can't you
[51:14] see that in God when he named his
[51:17] attributes or his offspring or his
[51:22] children but they would also have n ways
[51:25] and Natures right
[51:28] amen why can't we see
[51:32] that why can't we see that there's
[51:34] something real about that name that you
[51:36] don't even know
[51:38] yet the prophet said to be made known
[51:40] when we get
[51:43] dire
[51:45] H not worried about it you know
[51:48] everybody in the message I remember this
[51:50] one brother he got on up in age and he
[51:53] divorced his wife and a bunch of garbage
[51:55] but
[51:57] he got him a new wife and you know what
[51:58] she found out his new
[52:02] name and she told him his new name well
[52:04] you know what that is contrary to the
[52:09] scripture cu the scripture says only you
[52:14] know the name read it the Book of
[52:18] Revelation that no man knows himself you
[52:21] know in other words nobody else knows it
[52:23] you only know it yourself so how could
[52:26] you get my new name and come tell me
[52:28] said brother Dale I I found it out your
[52:30] name is not Samuel your name is is Joe
[52:34] he's not here tonight trying to get
[52:39] him well what good would that help me
[52:41] cuz I know you're
[52:45] wrong it would be only revealed to
[52:49] me all right look at what I'm talking
[52:55] about
[52:57] you are
[52:58] real in
[53:00] heaven because we're talking about
[53:02] eternal
[53:06] life if you have eternal life tonight
[53:10] that eternal life was the life of God or
[53:12] is the life of God you
[53:15] agree all right and that was in God in
[53:18] the beginning
[53:19] right when he had all his
[53:22] attributes he was a father a Healer a
[53:25] savior Etc there was just nothing
[53:28] displayed on Earth to cover those things
[53:30] yet yet it was already there in him I
[53:34] was trying to get it across to a couple
[53:35] of services why can't we see the eternal
[53:37] life that he has given us was in glory
[53:41] then I can say that I walked the shores
[53:43] of Galilee in Jesus Christ am you know
[53:48] but you know I can say I was with
[53:52] Abraham I can say I was with David when
[53:55] he killed Goliath
[53:57] why right because of my connection back
[54:01] in that eternal
[54:03] life that's what I'm trying to get you
[54:05] to
[54:06] see your name written in the lounge book
[54:09] of life section the Eternal section will
[54:11] be the name that you should have had had
[54:13] it not been a
[54:16] fall okay you go along with
[54:19] me we should have come without a fall
[54:21] right you
[54:22] agree but God had attributes so there
[54:26] was no way it could be any other thing
[54:27] do allow it to take place he permitted
[54:30] it to happen to way it's happened to
[54:32] display those attributes but you and I
[54:34] had to be there in the beginning in
[54:36] Jesus
[54:38] Christ now watch that Sunday when we go
[54:42] back because I still hold the
[54:45] point you talk about people saying they
[54:48] come into the world with eternal life
[54:50] that come here that always was
[54:53] eternal I fought that from the beginning
[54:55] because we must receive eternal life we
[54:58] must receive the new birth to have the
[55:01] eternal life then the eternal life
[55:03] always was eternal cuz how many times
[55:06] have I made this statement be
[55:08] careful you'll redeem yourself out of
[55:18] existence you realize that he will never
[55:21] God will
[55:23] never go back to be self-existent
[55:29] he'll never go back to be self-existent
[55:33] amen why cuz he brought us into
[55:37] being we were there not as people's
[55:40] identities and little lines and him but
[55:42] what don't you look at it sometimes and
[55:43] draw it out and make it the body of
[55:46] Christ and just look at the body of
[55:48] Christ and see if that ain't the Bride
[55:50] of Jesus Christ why don't you look at
[55:52] the seven Church ages and just see that
[55:55] it was God in each one of these
[55:57] ages living in this true
[56:00] rde
[56:02] right God
[56:04] himself so like I said the other day
[56:07] where the Prophet said what age would
[56:09] you like to
[56:10] live brother R said I'd like to live in
[56:13] this life
[56:14] age but you know some of them maybe
[56:17] didn't get a choice about where they
[56:18] wanted to live but you know what God put
[56:21] them to that
[56:23] age in that
[56:25] time not their natural nature don't get
[56:28] that involved that's all that's part of
[56:30] it sure brother around had a natural
[56:32] nature of Elijah A wilderness man but
[56:35] that was not his the nature that God was
[56:38] talking
[56:39] about it's the nature of the
[56:44] Prophet that was his natural nature that
[56:47] you look out here and see that made him
[56:48] wanted to hunt and fish and
[56:51] stuff but you see ever born again
[56:54] believer then being a part of
[56:57] God we wouldn't all be the same way in
[57:02] things but if you see what I'm talking
[57:04] about and can see that that pull
[57:07] ourselves back there but just don't go
[57:09] too far and stop right there where we
[57:11] will get up Sunday to of where that it's
[57:13] the the the Lo logos the word the
[57:16] theophany the the pillar of fire the the
[57:18] Son of God that comes out to begin to
[57:21] create if we wasn't in that in God we
[57:23] never will be there cuz that was eternal
[57:26] life
[57:27] that was God's full nature that stepped
[57:30] out there to begin to
[57:33] create and I was part of
[57:38] that you that have eternal life was part
[57:42] of that
[57:43] nature that walked his shores of Galilee
[57:46] without you and I he doesn't have his
[57:51] nature but you see then you can be
[57:55] redeemed
[57:56] what does the word redeem mean it means
[57:59] to go back where you came from
[58:03] right you're in the pawn shop you're
[58:06] redeemed out of the pawn
[58:08] shop you go back where you come from see
[58:12] now we can go
[58:14] back and
[58:16] see that if we have eternal
[58:19] life we was in him in heaven amen and we
[58:24] can be redeemed to that point
[58:28] but we won't go back that
[58:32] far because he don't want us to go that
[58:37] far come on we're trying to get
[58:39] something God don't want us to go back
[58:41] that far that's right he don't want us
[58:44] to go towards self-existing that's
[58:48] right he wants us to be what we are here
[58:50] on
[58:55] Earth he wants us to be the part of him
[58:58] here on Earth to speak to people and do
[59:01] things amen he wants us to be his
[59:04] children his
[59:06] offspring and he'll never go back to
[59:08] self-existing
[59:11] he'll always be known as Jehovah which
[59:15] would be signifying a father with his
[59:19] family cuz he said over there in the Old
[59:21] Testament he said by my name Jehovah was
[59:23] you never was I never known that never
[59:26] did know that name Jehovah because they
[59:28] couldn't pronounce it cuz it was
[59:30] jvh and there was no way to pronounce it
[59:32] they put vowels in it you know the AEI
[59:35] O's and the U's guys in it you know and
[59:37] and they come up with
[59:38] Jehovah but that wasn't away his name is
[59:43] Jesus The Only Name God ever had was
[59:46] Jesus I like one old brother U what was
[59:49] his name Theo arasmus years ago right it
[59:51] up and he just take he take the the US
[59:56] off of Jesus and said what you got his
[59:58] name would be
[1:00:00] Jess I Glory shouted because that's the
[1:00:03] truth you take away the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ away from the plan of God's
[1:00:08] salvation and he has not got a Plan of
[1:00:11] Salvation he only got a this creation
[1:00:14] and a bringing forth and this happens
[1:00:16] and that happens and judge it and kill
[1:00:18] it and destroy it no it's
[1:00:24] not see we can be
[1:00:27] redeemed but how far do you want to be
[1:00:37] redeemed do you want to go out of
[1:00:39] existence
[1:00:42] no I want to go back to see my real
[1:00:46] part I want to be redeemed in my real
[1:00:49] part and you know what those who make
[1:00:51] the change is going to come to that part
[1:00:53] before we leave out of here cuz that's
[1:00:56] what's going to make the
[1:00:57] change you know
[1:01:00] what it's not a running out of time cuz
[1:01:03] God don't have any it's not a running
[1:01:05] out of Revelation because it never will
[1:01:07] exhaust
[1:01:09] that it's a real reality of a people to
[1:01:12] realize who they
[1:01:14] are We Are The Offspring of God we are
[1:01:17] his children we're the Sons and
[1:01:19] Daughters of a living God by the new
[1:01:24] birth
[1:01:26] our name has a lot to do with us your
[1:01:29] name naturally has a not lot to do with
[1:01:33] you that's you know that's that's why
[1:01:35] brother around said For Heaven's Sake
[1:01:37] don't call you kids
[1:01:39] Ricky he said don't do it he said change
[1:01:41] it for the
[1:01:43] gospel all right because now if he hears
[1:01:46] that on tape he he talk to me about
[1:01:49] it we'll try to find out something about
[1:01:51] it call him Richard orever what his name
[1:01:54] is
[1:01:56] cuz it ain't going to help him to change
[1:01:58] his natural name I'm wanting his heart
[1:02:02] changed when the heart changes Ricky
[1:02:06] goes right right right sure it still has
[1:02:10] a human bearing upon
[1:02:13] us the time you're born under the sign
[1:02:16] you're born under the time of the month
[1:02:17] you're born under your parents and their
[1:02:20] nature and and brother randam did you
[1:02:22] know that he even said that where you're
[1:02:24] born again at will determine whether
[1:02:26] you're emotional or not
[1:02:34] emotional all of that's
[1:02:36] involved but that's just the
[1:02:40] outside let's get on down in here where
[1:02:42] we live
[1:02:46] at I want I want to be redeemed to the
[1:02:49] part that I'm supposed to make manifest
[1:02:53] upon this Earth that's right that's
[1:02:55] righten
[1:02:56] because that will be the display of my
[1:02:59] father that's
[1:03:01] right that's why you've heard me say
[1:03:04] that brother ROM says see gifts and
[1:03:05] callings are without repentance the
[1:03:07] Bible
[1:03:08] say gifts are predestinated eternally
[1:03:11] now listen he's so specific if you want
[1:03:13] me to bring it I'll show you he said not
[1:03:16] to not the nine spiritual gifts the nine
[1:03:20] spiritual gifts is not counted in that
[1:03:23] but see the prophets were counted in and
[1:03:25] the for Ministry is counted a gift
[1:03:29] that's why it says he gave some Apostles
[1:03:31] and some prophets some evangelists I've
[1:03:33] tried to explain that to you my wife see
[1:03:35] in it he gives you what you out need
[1:03:39] of right some Churches they can't handle
[1:03:43] a p a teacher
[1:03:45] Ministry they would break up the church
[1:03:47] and lose all of them well God Honors
[1:03:50] that now what the preacher does with it
[1:03:53] that's his business I don't have nothing
[1:03:54] to do with it I just tell it like it is
[1:03:56] and leave it
[1:03:58] alone but you see he gave some prophets
[1:04:02] because that's what to add
[1:04:04] me God gave the
[1:04:07] church
[1:04:09] gifts according to Ephesians
[1:04:11] there and Galatians and gifts but not
[1:04:15] the just the nine spiritual gifts that
[1:04:18] can
[1:04:19] work but the real true gift the real
[1:04:22] true Ministry is a gift unto a
[1:04:24] church that's why you pull off the
[1:04:28] gift and don't look at to the guy that's
[1:04:30] doing the part that's working it cuz
[1:04:33] you're going to get confused every
[1:04:36] time now that don't justify us to go out
[1:04:39] and live like the devil ain't talking
[1:04:40] garbage
[1:04:41] C I'm talking about that we are human
[1:04:44] mortal people brother Dale is a human
[1:04:47] mortal and is subject to things of this
[1:04:49] Mortal life subject to frustrations and
[1:04:53] and heartaches and trouble just as much
[1:04:55] as
[1:04:56] anybody but I wish I could explain that
[1:05:03] gift I've tried
[1:05:08] to I've tried to explain a gift that God
[1:05:11] gave me that can't do
[1:05:14] it see he's never failed me yet I've
[1:05:17] never come to this pull pit without a
[1:05:19] message that's 40 something
[1:05:23] years I've come to this building without
[1:05:27] you know a good clearcut where your way
[1:05:29] it's going right but he's never failed
[1:05:32] the gift that's right it don't matter
[1:05:35] how sick I am or what's going on or what
[1:05:38] I can stop just a
[1:05:41] moment and that gift will be
[1:05:44] there but that don't make anything for
[1:05:47] you folks other than one thing you honor
[1:05:50] the gift God will honor you he will
[1:05:53] speak to your heart if you honor the
[1:05:54] gift any of these ministers you honor
[1:05:57] the gift I honor those gifts I do not
[1:06:00] there's no way will I say anything
[1:06:01] against a
[1:06:03] gift because the gift can be there and
[1:06:06] and the one that's using it can be all
[1:06:08] messed
[1:06:10] up but don't you worry about it if it's
[1:06:13] a true gift he'll straighten him
[1:06:15] out that's why I say I'm responsible to
[1:06:18] God to what I say and do and talk to you
[1:06:20] about and I try not to even some
[1:06:22] sometimes tell you
[1:06:23] something why because I don't want you
[1:06:25] built on just Samuel Dale and some point
[1:06:28] you know that there's a gift there's an
[1:06:29] operation or this that and the other any
[1:06:32] five-fold Ministry that there is with a
[1:06:34] gift of God can do the same thing I do
[1:06:38] and that's sit down in your study and
[1:06:39] say God give me what you want the people
[1:06:43] to
[1:06:46] hear come on the scene and speak to my
[1:06:48] heart then I'll go speak to
[1:06:50] them cuz see gifts and callings are
[1:06:53] without
[1:06:54] repentance I never repented to get
[1:06:59] one but
[1:07:01] listen it don't mean I'm saved either
[1:07:03] just because a gift can
[1:07:06] work I don't mind saying that that's
[1:07:09] right see that's where people think that
[1:07:11] it's not they say well well I'm a I'm a
[1:07:13] minister so it doesn't matter yes it
[1:07:17] does don't think because you're a
[1:07:19] preacher that you can get by of anything
[1:07:21] that's right you're going to answer more
[1:07:23] than anybody else right right you can
[1:07:25] take my word for
[1:07:27] it you'll answer more than
[1:07:30] anybody but you see that's why I never
[1:07:32] worry about you know being sick or
[1:07:37] anything I just say
[1:07:39] Lord I didn't call myself to
[1:07:43] preach you mean you talk to him like
[1:07:45] that yes
[1:07:47] sir Lord I didn't call myself to preach
[1:07:50] you call me whether I'm right or not
[1:07:53] just use it
[1:07:57] never seen him
[1:08:00] fail see if we just be that way as
[1:08:05] Christians and find out we're the
[1:08:07] children of
[1:08:10] God those gifts and things was ordained
[1:08:13] before the foundation of the
[1:08:15] world I see brother Richard quotes one I
[1:08:18] haven't looked it up but I know he
[1:08:19] quotes
[1:08:22] it there something like yeah will
[1:08:25] brandom said ordained you to preach the
[1:08:27] gospel before the foundation of the
[1:08:30] world we know that's true cuz that's
[1:08:32] what he said to all the
[1:08:36] prophets
[1:08:38] true Jeremiah knew you and ordained you
[1:08:42] a prophet while he was in your mother's
[1:08:44] W did that save Jeremiah
[1:08:47] no no don't ever get that idea that
[1:08:51] preaching saves you that's right I can
[1:08:54] quote too much and brother
[1:08:56] R he said I'm saved if I never preach
[1:08:59] another
[1:09:03] sermon but he said who would want to
[1:09:05] stop from preaching to tell him about
[1:09:07] Jesus
[1:09:10] right brother up in call brother that I
[1:09:14] knew years ago backley had I talked to
[1:09:17] him a few years later and he said
[1:09:19] Brother D why is it that I still get
[1:09:23] sermons he said I know
[1:09:27] backlit but he said I still get sermons
[1:09:29] just like I did when I was
[1:09:32] preaching I said
[1:09:34] yeah because gifts and callings are
[1:09:36] without repentance
[1:09:39] brother the gift is there but Heaven
[1:09:42] help
[1:09:43] you to use it brother Brown said his
[1:09:47] gift was there so much until some people
[1:09:50] wanted to know where Oil was one time
[1:09:51] you remember
[1:09:54] that
[1:09:55] and he said they had a selfish motive
[1:09:57] even though they said we'll put all of
[1:09:59] the money into the work you know he knew
[1:10:01] they didn't mean
[1:10:03] that he said I knew where the oil was at
[1:10:06] and said it wouldn't tell
[1:10:08] them he said they tried and tried and
[1:10:10] couldn't find it he said one man come in
[1:10:13] from somewhere else and sat down hit a
[1:10:14] gusher and found the the
[1:10:17] oil that gift to
[1:10:20] work brother Mo used to tell about the
[1:10:22] Russian monk you may have heard of him
[1:10:24] that the people that they had their
[1:10:25] their child had some kind of disease in
[1:10:27] this old Russian monk they would get in
[1:10:29] touch with him well he could be as drunk
[1:10:31] as a coot on the D Floor and women's
[1:10:32] arms all kind of good they got in touch
[1:10:35] with him he would stop the whole thing
[1:10:37] get right down on the floor and
[1:10:40] pray and God would heal that
[1:10:46] boy because it's what they
[1:10:51] believed but do you see what I'm talking
[1:10:53] about and as we end this part
[1:10:56] we found a lot of things are up in
[1:10:58] heaven you know that's where all the
[1:11:01] things that we have need of is coming
[1:11:06] from I thought we believe
[1:11:09] that the word came to the
[1:11:13] prophet but where did it come
[1:11:16] from it come from
[1:11:19] Heaven Come From The
[1:11:22] Throne what did the prophet cover on
[1:11:24] adoption
[1:11:28] Angels
[1:11:30] ascending are descending and ascending
[1:11:32] you know going up and down
[1:11:36] amen see those
[1:11:39] angels coming down and taking your
[1:11:41] prayers and carry them up to God L amen
[1:11:45] God stops in heaven and says go to Earth
[1:11:49] and take care of
[1:11:51] it amen you said well why don't we see
[1:11:54] more than what what we see brother Dale
[1:11:56] because we don't
[1:12:00] believe we believe the
[1:12:05] word
[1:12:06] right but we don't honor it to the basis
[1:12:10] of putting our entire life upon
[1:12:15] that nothing wrong with going to doctors
[1:12:17] nothing wrong with being anything like
[1:12:19] that you can go to doctor and have every
[1:12:22] bit of your confidence right in the
[1:12:23] directly in God that serve that you
[1:12:24] serve
[1:12:26] Ser because that don't prove
[1:12:30] nothing but you see one of these days
[1:12:32] we'll understand what the Bible said
[1:12:35] that heaven and earth
[1:12:38] kissed in Jesus Christ allmighty God
[1:12:41] came to this earth he came from
[1:12:45] Heaven that's why I wanted us to read
[1:12:47] that prayer you know what brother random
[1:12:50] would
[1:12:52] do some of you're grinning you know
[1:12:54] exactly what
[1:12:56] he would pray and a demon wouldn't leave
[1:12:59] people person would still be sick he
[1:13:02] said we're going to pray one more prayer
[1:13:03] and he's going and he'd stop and he'd
[1:13:06] say the Lord's
[1:13:11] prayer Our Father which are in heaven
[1:13:14] that's
[1:13:16] right ever Redemptive name of Jehovah is
[1:13:20] in the Lord's Prayer amen right amen
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:26] everything we have need
[1:13:28] of just think on these
[1:13:31] things we can be redeemed folks that's
[1:13:35] right that's right but we don't want to
[1:13:37] be redeemed out of
[1:13:40] existence so if we never had a fall we
[1:13:42] never had a problem and everything you
[1:13:44] you would be going back to where you
[1:13:46] came from and that would make you go
[1:13:47] back to the self-existing
[1:13:50] but when our journey on Earth took place
[1:13:53] and has taken place and is now taking
[1:13:56] place we have somewhere to
[1:13:59] go but it's not up into
[1:14:03] heaven we'll be able to go there one day
[1:14:06] because we want
[1:14:10] to because heaven and Earth is going to
[1:14:12] kiss
[1:14:14] again and the Bride of Jesus Christ will
[1:14:16] stand upon the Earth in God's
[1:14:18] word whether we believe it or not
[1:14:21] somebody's going to do it why can't we
[1:14:23] believe we're part of it come on stand
[1:14:25] together why can't we believe that we're
[1:14:28] part of
[1:14:34] it why can't we say that we're the
[1:14:36] redeem the Bible said let the redeem say
[1:14:42] so why can't we believe it why can't we
[1:14:45] stand up on God's
[1:14:47] word and say by stri I'm
[1:14:53] heal whatever we have Happ what we got
