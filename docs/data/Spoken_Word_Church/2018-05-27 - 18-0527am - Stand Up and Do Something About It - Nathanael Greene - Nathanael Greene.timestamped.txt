[3:00] others better than ourselves
[3:11] let this mind be in you which was also
[3:14] in Christ Jesus but made himself of no
[3:26] reputation and took upon him the form of
[3:29] a servant and was made in the likeness
[3:32] of man wherefore God also has highly
[3:51] exalted him and given him a name which
[3:55] is above every name and that every
[4:09] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[4:12] is the Lord to the glory of God the
[4:14] Father

[8:53] you have your seats for just a few
[8:55] minutes I'm gonna kind of like a
[8:58] background if the Lord will help me most
[9:03] of you know my dad and my grandpa and
[9:06] the gifts that's in their lives and on
[9:09] their lives and I kind of guess it was
[9:12] inevitable that it would fall upon me
[9:14] and but believe it or not I'm not I'm
[9:18] not used to not be the sweet Nate green
[9:20] that I am today I was quite rebellious
[9:23] quite attitude know at times and and
[9:28] just just I ran a long time brother
[9:32] weights been there he knows most of us
[9:35] have been there yeah it's it's hard
[9:38] being a pastor scary preacher's kid in
[9:41] general and you have that that spotlight
[9:44] on you all the time and you have to have
[9:47] to be on your P's and Q's when you're
[9:48] around people but it's a different life
[9:50] at home
[9:50] and I just I think the Lord that he they
[9:54] put a did a change in my life didn't
[9:57] work for me and and I'm not saying it
[10:01] wouldn't happen but it wouldn't happen
[10:02] without that little sister back there
[10:03] that that uh that come and kind of kind
[10:08] of set me in my place and gave me gave
[10:10] me an ultimatum you know I'm not gonna
[10:12] give him a whole testimony because it'll
[10:14] take up too much time but pretty much we
[10:18] were engaged to be married
[10:20] is this about 2015 I we were engaged to
[10:22] be married and that summer sister
[10:25] Kaitlyn had had enough and to the point
[10:29] to where it I was getting so bad that I
[10:32] was scared when I was you know bus cider
[10:34] for nothing and everything and uh the
[10:39] Lord really put it on her heart to kind
[10:41] of tell me to back off a little bit and
[10:43] we're gonna have we're gonna take a
[10:44] break and we're gonna we're gonna see
[10:46] how this goes just pray about it and and
[10:48] heard going to brother Ron's Church and
[10:51] me being best friends with brother
[10:52] Andrew that he was kind of our mediator
[10:55] at times and she was caller or he would
[10:57] call her and kind of give her some
[10:59] encouragement and then I would call him
[11:00] and pretty much break down and cry and
[11:04] and kind of tell him I don't what you
[11:07] know I don't want to lose her and he to
[11:09] the point he told me he said I wouldn't
[11:12] be mad if she left you this is just to
[11:15] put it bluntly I wouldn't be mad if she
[11:16] left you
[11:17] I would encourage it matter of fact
[11:19] because you're not where you need to be
[11:22] and she's trying to live right and she's
[11:23] wanting to start this family with you
[11:25] eventually and and if she doesn't break
[11:30] it now than it'll be it would be worse
[11:32] down the road so I got to the point of
[11:35] desperation I prayed I cried out to the
[11:40] Lord
[11:41] mom and dad prayed and I'm sure other
[11:44] people have prayed and I got to the
[11:47] point to where I didn't want to run
[11:49] anymore I didn't want to I didn't want
[11:51] to sit back on my haunches and just say
[11:54] well I'm a Pratt I'm a pastor's kid I'm
[11:56] I'm good to go you know and then turn
[11:59] around and cuss somebody out you know
[12:01] I've been there
[12:03] but I got desperate before the Lord and
[12:07] we were at camp meeting this 2015 the
[12:09] last night of camp me know some of you
[12:11] were later remember brother Ron preached
[12:13] and preached hard and after the service
[12:17] he was getting ready to come people up
[12:19] for prayer and he told me after the
[12:21] service he said I saw a lot over you and
[12:23] he called me out and said tonight is
[12:26] your night so men sister Caitlin walked
[12:30] down to the to the platform to get
[12:33] prayed for we were going as a couple but
[12:35] somehow we got separated brother Ron
[12:38] come to me and there's several other
[12:39] brothers come and prayed prayed to
[12:41] prayed with me prayed for me and all I
[12:44] remember in the prayer before I kind of
[12:46] fell out all I remember it was Satan
[12:49] this man is going to defeat you from
[12:50] behind the pulpit many times and that
[12:53] that's all I remember after that and
[12:55] then she was screaming everybody was
[12:57] coming the Spirit was it was unreal that
[12:59] night and that that night no one the
[13:04] same person I'm still not perfect let
[13:07] none of us are but from that night on I
[13:09] was a changed man and then he he kind of
[13:14] man he the next the next month we always
[13:19] tried to go up to their Labor Day
[13:21] meetings and he pulled me to the side he
[13:23] said I want to talk to you a little bit
[13:24] he gave me some encouragement and told
[13:27] me how to go about starting to study and
[13:28] starting to to gather thoughts and and
[13:31] just seeking the mind of the Lord for
[13:33] this Colin that he's placed on my
[13:34] laughing and he said I want to be your
[13:38] mentor because your daddy can't do it
[13:39] not that he can't do it but he don't
[13:42] want people to say well he's just
[13:43] preaching because his daddy's a preacher
[13:45] because both his grandpa's were
[13:46] preachers you know so he said I want to
[13:48] be that that mentor to you and he's been
[13:51] a real mentor and brother Wade and
[13:53] brother Sam have as well just watching
[13:55] their ministries and watching watching
[13:57] other ministers that I look up to and
[13:59] and just watching how they yield their
[14:02] selves to the to the Collin and to the
[14:04] spirit it's a it's a it's awesome to
[14:08] have friends and family that I consider
[14:11] these brothers and y'all family that
[14:13] that I can come to and confide in and
[14:16] to help me out when I when I need it or
[14:18] have a question or anything and so I got
[14:22] to I got to that point to say to kind of
[14:24] lead into what I want to speak on this
[14:25] morning I got to the point of I had to
[14:29] fight for what I wanted I had to I had
[14:32] to train myself to yield myself to the
[14:36] Lord to be in this position to where I
[14:39] can accept him to where he can come into
[14:41] my life and change my life and I'm gonna
[14:44] ask you to stand now and read the
[14:46] scripture I won't be too awful long this
[14:48] morning I'm sure you will turn your
[14:57] Bibles to Psalms 144 and also
[15:00] Philippians 4:13 you say a man when you
[15:08] got him
[15:09] blessed be the Lord my strength which
[15:12] teeth teaches my hands to war and my
[15:14] fingers to fight my goodness my fortress
[15:18] my high tower my deliverer my shield and
[15:22] he and whom I trust who subdue with my
[15:25] people under my feet the Philippians
[15:27] 4:13 it's a very familiar scripture I
[15:29] can do all things through Christ who
[15:32] strengtheneth me and you can have your
[15:34] seats this morning I want to speak on
[15:37] stand up and do something about it
[15:41] now many times we find ourselves in the
[15:43] midst of a battle I know everybody has
[15:45] battles
[15:45] everybody has trials and tests we find
[15:49] out whether that battle be spiritual or
[15:50] physical or mental looks like brother
[15:53] Branham said the greatest battlefield is
[15:55] in the mind the greatest battle ever
[15:57] fought hmm
[15:59] this seems more times than not that
[16:02] there's no way through it you're not
[16:04] gonna win you're not you're not gonna
[16:05] you can't see the light at the end of
[16:07] the tunnel but we know that God is our
[16:10] way maker we know that God is our
[16:12] strength as the scripture said we know
[16:14] that that he's there to lead us through
[16:15] no matter what no matter how bleak no
[16:18] matter how dark the circumstances that
[16:20] he's there brother Brennan says in there
[16:23] in the resurrection of Jesus and the
[16:26] great climax is at hand the great
[16:28] warfare
[16:28] between the devil and God is going on
[16:30] and the scene is being set for the final
[16:32] front lines where the where the clash
[16:34] will clump and God will reign and rule
[16:36] for the Lamb was with them overcome them
[16:39] for he's the Lord of lords for the king
[16:41] of kings and he will write down every
[16:43] opposition a man now us as Christians
[16:48] and trying to live in this world and
[16:50] trying to to be of this world we're not
[16:52] of this world we just have to live in it
[16:54] we have to fight daily we have to fight
[16:56] for our lives every time we go to the
[16:57] grocery store we have to fight you know
[16:59] we have every time we walk out of the
[17:01] house pretty much we're not in our
[17:02] sanctuary we have to fight we have to
[17:04] find out we have to make sure we have
[17:06] our blinders on make sure that we're not
[17:08] doing you know just a me anything that's
[17:10] unpleasing to God and thing that's going
[17:13] to hinder our walks now I read this
[17:17] morning excuse me I want to I want to
[17:19] try to bring out and forgive my folly
[17:21] but Bible says through the foolish
[17:22] foolishness of preaching souls were
[17:23] saved so I want to bring out a
[17:26] heavyweight title boxing match I want to
[17:30] kind of break it down for you and and
[17:32] tell you how that goes and kind of relay
[17:35] it to our spiritual walks this morning
[17:37] yeah the first the first step in a in a
[17:40] boxing match would be the promotion
[17:43] stage would be where they tell everybody
[17:44] that there's going to be a fight they
[17:46] printed the newspapers they printed in
[17:47] social media they do they do everything
[17:49] and there's there's a lot of ads in this
[17:53] newspaper right here there's there's
[17:54] there's ads for everything and but we're
[17:57] gonna speak on the ad the telling us
[17:59] that the fights coming 2nd Corinthians
[18:02] 10 and 4 for the weapons of our warfare
[18:04] are not carnal but mighty through God to
[18:07] the pulling down of strongholds he's
[18:09] gonna be there to pull down those walls
[18:11] when we can't do it when we can't when
[18:13] we can't get break through the wall when
[18:15] we can't get over the other side we
[18:18] can't jump over ourselves he's gonna
[18:19] pick us up in peace over the wall he's
[18:20] gonna break down the wall the brother
[18:23] branham says in the conflict between God
[18:25] and Satan God knew this great warfare
[18:28] was coming on between right and wrong
[18:29] and he knew what the enemy was going to
[18:31] do he'd know just exactly how to equip
[18:34] his people so if we notice the first
[18:36] thing the very first thing that God
[18:38] equipped his children with was being
[18:40] infinite he knowed what it
[18:42] to defeat Satan anytime anyplace
[18:44] anywhere on any conditions
[18:47] there's several scriptures that I have
[18:49] here that are advertisements for that
[18:51] fight telling you that it's coming and
[18:52] telling you to get ready job 14 and one
[18:55] man that is born of a woman is a few
[18:57] days and full of trouble so that tells
[18:59] us that we're gonna have troubles that
[19:00] tells us that we're gonna have
[19:02] heartaches and trials first Peter five
[19:05] and eight be sober be vigilant because
[19:08] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[19:10] lion walking walketh about seeking whom
[19:12] he may devour he's always on the prowl
[19:15] I always trying to always trying to find
[19:18] somebody who's broke down who's not
[19:20] strong and spiritually not not where
[19:24] they need to be and he'll sneak in there
[19:26] and try to bring him down excuse me the
[19:31] next the next the thing there's several
[19:33] components to this is the training and
[19:35] conditioning each fighter like rhoda me
[19:38] and brother Wade were talking last night
[19:39] brother brother Muhammad Ali he he
[19:43] trained he trained religiously and he
[19:47] always knew what his opponent was going
[19:49] to do he always knew when to duck and
[19:51] when to weave and when to Bob and they
[19:54] have each fighter has their own methods
[19:55] and on condition on ways of conditioning
[19:58] their bodies to get ready for the fight
[20:01] Ephesians six verses 12 through 17 for
[20:06] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[20:07] but against the principalities against
[20:10] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[20:13] this world against spiritual wickedness
[20:14] in high places where for unto you
[20:17] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[20:19] of God that you may be able to withstand
[20:21] in this evil day and having and having
[20:24] done all to stand stand therefore your
[20:27] loins Girt about with the truth and
[20:28] having the breastplate of righteousness
[20:29] and your feet shod with the preparation
[20:32] of the gospel of peace above all take
[20:34] the shield of faith wherewith you shall
[20:37] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[20:38] the wicked and take the helmet of
[20:40] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[20:42] which is the word of God now we know
[20:45] that the word stand means to get ready
[20:48] it means to stance yourself to get ready
[20:52] don't know understand hearing that come
[20:55] at me don't
[20:56] you know you're gonna get a knock on
[20:57] your rear end in other words but stand
[21:01] stand to be ready be ready to fight
[21:04] because once he starts throwing those
[21:05] punches he's not going to stop he's not
[21:06] gonna wait on you to get ready they said
[21:10] back the scripture says gird your loins
[21:12] that means they rolled up their skirts
[21:15] and tied them off so when they got ready
[21:17] to run into battle they wouldn't trip
[21:18] them up it wouldn't slow them down
[21:19] that's what we have to do today we have
[21:21] to get in the word and gird ourselves
[21:22] and get ready to get ready to to fight
[21:25] because he's not going to tell you that
[21:28] when the fights coming he's not going to
[21:29] tell you when he's going to come attack
[21:30] you it's just gonna happen it's gonna be
[21:32] right there many fighters they study
[21:38] their opponents they find their
[21:39] strengths and their weaknesses and how
[21:41] they move and when they're gonna go this
[21:42] way and go that way and brother Branham
[21:46] says in the contest is one of my
[21:48] favorite quotes he talks about
[21:49] six-second Smith think of this Smith is
[21:52] now now training for a contest is just
[21:55] like a boxer his enemy excuse me that's
[21:58] the wrong quote but we'll get to that
[21:59] one in a second that this one's good too
[22:01] now training for a contest is just like
[22:03] a boxer his his enemy that he's going to
[22:06] meet out there in the contest to fight a
[22:08] real good fighter usually knows then
[22:10] studies his opponent he studies his
[22:12] licks knows where he fights for or
[22:14] whether he leans forward hangs back
[22:16] fights right-handed or left-handed he
[22:18] studies all this and then if he's if
[22:21] he's a good smart fighter he gets him a
[22:22] sparring partner at a fight just like
[22:24] his opponent that he fights for he'll
[22:26] know all of his licks when he gets to
[22:29] that place and I think that's a very
[22:31] good thing for Christians to do that
[22:33] that's right and now if you want to
[22:36] start training start with John 3:16 the
[22:38] golden rule start right out with that
[22:40] and that'll get you on the floor and
[22:42] then train for the for the knockout
[22:44] punches because you're going to have to
[22:46] use them everybody knows that you you
[22:50] have to train to hit your enemy and
[22:51] always God uses his word we must
[22:53] remember that God uses his word to
[22:55] defeat his enemy if God could think or
[22:58] could have his give or could have give
[23:00] his people anything better to defeat the
[23:02] enemy with he would have done it he gave
[23:07] us everything we need he gave us the
[23:10] tools it gave us the the gloves that we
[23:12] need he gave us the outfit and you know
[23:15] the ring to practice in that's that's
[23:17] why we come to church that's why that's
[23:20] why your pastor preaches come to church
[23:22] be here when the doors are open and
[23:24] sorry brother that that's not in the
[23:27] notes but that's that's where we come to
[23:30] Train that's where we come to get fed
[23:31] that's where we come to to to to get
[23:35] stronger now read brother Brandon was
[23:39] talking in the quote they're getting a
[23:40] sparring partner that's the next the
[23:41] next step and there's that quote I was
[23:43] referring to says when I first started
[23:46] training for boxing before I got in
[23:48] professional fighting there used to be a
[23:49] trainer they caught him six-second Smith
[23:51] the first professional fight he had he
[23:54] whipped the man in six seconds and when
[23:56] I started training that man liked to
[23:57] killed me he knocked me knocked me plumb
[24:00] out of the ring and everything else and
[24:01] I was skipping ropes and running seven
[24:03] eight miles every day and taking all the
[24:05] training and I said six why do you have
[24:08] to do me that way see I said you just
[24:11] knocked the breath right out of me man
[24:12] when I went plumb over four ropes come
[24:14] right out of there and amongst them
[24:16] chairs and like two broke my back on
[24:18] them he looks laughed and said that'll
[24:20] do you good
[24:20] I said do me good how can it do me good
[24:23] you're about to kill me they said look
[24:25] Billy I don't care how physically fit
[24:27] you are your body's got to be able to
[24:29] stand it come back right quick if you
[24:32] take a hard punch said if your body's
[24:34] not used to coming back you'll lay there
[24:36] and take the county sit but if your body
[24:39] is used to taking it then coming back
[24:41] every time you hit it that shocks the
[24:43] blood runs back to the heart said if
[24:45] you'll do that then your body is used to
[24:47] coming back quick when you get knocked
[24:48] down brother branham snapped his fingers
[24:50] on your feet again see and said that
[24:53] that don't mean a thing when you get
[24:55] knocked down up on your feet again quick
[24:56] said you hate me now but you'll
[24:58] appreciate me when you get out there in
[25:00] the ring and that was right you'll
[25:02] appreciate these men of God that come
[25:04] and stomp on your toes and and and say
[25:08] things you don't you think we don't like
[25:09] to hear the things that you need may not
[25:12] be the things you like to hear just like
[25:13] when you're sick when you were a kid and
[25:15] your mama gives you this nasty awful
[25:17] medicine you don't like it but it makes
[25:18] you feel better
[25:21] there's
[25:24] there was two instances where where God
[25:27] could where David could prove God would
[25:30] help him defeat Goliath it was practice
[25:32] fights that David had it's barn barn
[25:35] fights practice practice rounds he had
[25:37] the lion and the bear that that he he
[25:41] defeated those that God put him into
[25:44] training so that he'd be able to defeat
[25:46] Goliath when the time was right and we
[25:49] come down to supplements and vitamins
[25:53] some of you know about it fighters they
[25:56] take vitamins and supplements to help
[25:57] build up their muscles and and their
[26:00] stamina and help them focus and and
[26:04] there's there's promises and medicine
[26:07] I'll through this by this medicine
[26:08] cabinet right here it's the best
[26:10] medicine ever there's there's there's so
[26:13] many so many supplements and don't even
[26:16] need a prescription for him just open it
[26:18] up and read it
[26:20] brother Blaine Lawson's sister she went
[26:23] through the message and counted out all
[26:27] the miracles all the excuse me
[26:30] she counted out all the visions in the
[26:34] message that come to pass and that's a
[26:39] that's a strong feat in itself just to
[26:40] sit sit there and listen to all the
[26:42] messages and and figure out what was
[26:45] right and have to go back and listen to
[26:47] it again to make sure you got it all
[26:48] down right but she come up with eight
[26:50] thousand eight hundred and eighty three
[26:52] visions in the message not the one just
[26:54] the ones that were on tape that the
[26:56] Prophet had that come come to pass and
[27:00] we're in the but we all know that
[27:02] there's eighty eight hundred promises in
[27:04] the Bible so that's that was a non
[27:06] comparison and that we don't have need
[27:11] of anything we need vitamins for
[27:14] spiritual strength just go to the
[27:16] medicine cabinet if we need an
[27:18] antidepressant just go to the medicine
[27:20] cabinet if we need something for we need
[27:24] a word just to encourage us about a
[27:26] loved one that may not be where they
[27:27] need to be it's in the medicine cabinet
[27:29] there's there's a gospel for everything
[27:32] Hebrew 6 and 12 says that ye may not be
[27:35] slothful but followers of them who
[27:37] through faith and patience inherit the
[27:39] promises brother Branham says again in
[27:42] the conflict between God and Satan now
[27:44] he wouldn't say I'll give them something
[27:47] here and then a few years later I'm a
[27:48] study out something better to give them
[27:50] and then after a few years later like we
[27:53] in military force the old bow and arrow
[27:56] and sledge and rock hammer and then the
[27:58] next was after a bow and arrow come
[28:00] musket and after the musket come to
[28:02] Springfield and now it's the atomic
[28:04] weapons and things say we keep growing
[28:06] more God always gives us what we need
[28:08] from that time but God at the beginning
[28:11] gave his children the atomic weapon
[28:13] because he's the infinite God now seeing
[28:17] where there was going to be a conflict
[28:18] and there was going to be a battle god
[28:21] equipped his children with the right
[28:23] kind of ammunition right kind of an
[28:25] attack excuse me the right kind of
[28:29] everything that they had need of that
[28:31] would sweep them all away from Eden to
[28:34] the rapture what was it it was the word
[28:36] the word that's what defeats Satan is
[28:39] the word it'll defeat him anywhere any
[28:41] place now why don't we why do we want to
[28:44] substitute something else when we've
[28:46] already got the best thing that there is
[28:47] the word that's there's there's nothing
[28:50] else but brother brother wait ask me
[28:52] when I left the house this morning you
[28:53] got your battle axe with you and he
[28:55] already knew what I was going to speak
[28:56] on this morning but I said yeah I got it
[28:59] don't go anywhere without it you know no
[29:02] one don't know when you'll have to whip
[29:04] it out and cut the devil's head off the
[29:10] next step leading up to the fight it
[29:12] would be the press conferences many
[29:15] times the two fighters will get together
[29:17] and they'll kind of hash it out talk
[29:19] about it talk about their expectations
[29:21] for the fight talk about what they think
[29:24] is going to happen and how they're gonna
[29:27] react to the opponent when it when he
[29:29] tries to come after them and stuff and
[29:31] there's some times that it gets a little
[29:34] heated they start talking smack to each
[29:36] other and getting nose to nose and
[29:39] wanting to start to fight right there
[29:41] and many times that's what Satan does he
[29:42] sits right up here and says you ain't
[29:44] good enough you're going to
[29:45] me you ain't gonna do you ain't gonna do
[29:48] what what you think you're gonna do
[29:49] you're not you're not good enough you
[29:51] have you have you ever the devil ever
[29:53] told you that there's a just me he he
[29:59] gets he gets on me quite a bit tells me
[30:01] I'm not good enough you know me just
[30:03] starting out preaching and everything
[30:04] and I know he is and that's that's when
[30:07] I take him to the word and show him you
[30:09] know show him what's what and who to
[30:12] tell him I got the best trainer in my
[30:14] corner we we try it we'll be finding
[30:23] that that too when during the press
[30:25] conference before the crucifixion before
[30:27] Jesus was crucified
[30:29] when Satan come to him Matthew 4 and
[30:31] tried to tempt him and God don't back
[30:34] down
[30:35] hey don't back God's children don't back
[30:36] down it's like I said we got the best
[30:39] trainer in our corner sometimes they
[30:43] have to hold each other back though they
[30:44] have to get their trainers and stuff to
[30:46] hold them back and and keep them from
[30:49] jumping on each other before the fight
[30:51] and then they there's times when when I
[30:55] was out in the world and stuff that
[30:57] people would look at me the wrong way
[30:58] and if I had been for some of my buddies
[31:01] holding me back that'd probably be
[31:03] behind bars somewhere cuz I was I never
[31:06] got into any fights but I wanted to
[31:07] fight a lot we come to we come down to
[31:11] the weigh-ins
[31:13] there's several weigh ins that leads up
[31:15] to the fight to make sure that they're
[31:17] where they need to be if they're not too
[31:19] big like me you're too small or they're
[31:22] just they just got to be just right and
[31:23] that's what we got to be is the bride to
[31:25] go to go home we got to be just right
[31:28] oftentimes like myself we find ourselves
[31:31] out of shape what's round is a shape but
[31:34] that's oh we find we find ourselves out
[31:37] of shape spiritually out of shape
[31:39] physically and well they the same can be
[31:44] said for us as Christians like I just
[31:46] said we let some problem or circumstance
[31:48] weigh us down too much yes sir
[31:56] and Hebrews twelve and one says
[31:58] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[31:59] about with such a great cloud of
[32:01] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[32:03] and the sin which does so easily beset
[32:06] us and let us run with patience the race
[32:08] that is set before us we can't run with
[32:12] follow I don't run anyways but we can't
[32:14] run with all this weight on us we can't
[32:15] run with all the weight on our shoulders
[32:16] and we can't we're not like you said
[32:20] when I took my jacket off can't fight
[32:21] with a jacket on you got to take stuff
[32:23] off to be able to move to be able to to
[32:26] dodge the fiery darts as I read earlier
[32:28] to dodge the smack-talk and the devil
[32:33] sitting on his shoulder just flick him
[32:34] off and keep going what you're doing and
[32:38] the ruin brother said the other night at
[32:41] home he said when you find out water who
[32:43] you're fighting then it's time to fight
[32:45] now as now comes time for the main event
[32:48] the moment you've been training for the
[32:50] moment we've we've been going to church
[32:53] for all these years the moment we've
[32:55] been waiting for it's time to fight it's
[32:59] time to time to stand up for that
[33:01] problem that you have your time to stand
[33:03] up for that deliverance you need for a
[33:05] family member for yourself time to stand
[33:07] up to get that depression off of you
[33:08] that that evil spirit that's been
[33:11] hanging around it's time to stand up and
[33:13] tell it where to go when that bell rings
[33:16] we have two choices we can either run
[33:19] and hide and we can fight they call it
[33:21] at work when I work security and they
[33:23] call it the fight-or-flight response
[33:26] either you fly and hide or you stand in
[33:30] fire and they want you to stand the
[33:32] fight as a last resort but I'm telling
[33:33] you somebody's coming after me I'm gonna
[33:35] stand there I don't I don't want to be
[33:38] the one to run away and hide I want to
[33:39] stand and fight for everything that's
[33:40] within me brother Branham says and God
[33:44] talks to Moses look I'll give it to you
[33:47] the lands over there but before you get
[33:49] there you've got to fight that's what's
[33:51] the matter with people today they're
[33:53] afraid to stand and fight what we need
[33:55] is and I'm assuming this is a song that
[33:57] says I must fight if I should rain
[33:59] increase my courage Lord must must I be
[34:02] carried home to heaven on a flower bed
[34:04] of ease with while others fought to win
[34:07] the prize and cell-cell through bloody
[34:09] seas whew
[34:09] me know I must fight if I must ring
[34:12] that's right he says we're when when it
[34:16] comes time to them to introduce the
[34:18] fighters you know the crowds getting
[34:19] amped up getting getting pumped up in
[34:22] the Devils just already in the ring
[34:24] waiting on us to come out he's just
[34:25] standing there yet and he had trained to
[34:28] lead like some people that don't come to
[34:30] church and then and then come in and say
[34:33] you know preached me happy I'm ready to
[34:36] go home and that's what he'll train one
[34:38] time and then sat down on the couch and
[34:40] ate tater chips and everything and wait
[34:41] on us to to come after him like we're
[34:43] gonna come after him
[34:44] we don't go cooking for a fight he does
[34:46] because he knows in the end who wins
[34:48] he's read the back of the book just like
[34:50] us but he's just sitting around this
[34:52] waiting and all of a sudden he hears
[34:55] that music Amazing Grace coming from the
[34:57] bag and he starts getting a little
[34:59] little antsy he starts to kind of
[35:01] straighten up a little bit and look
[35:02] through those doors back there and see
[35:04] see wait they'll come see Sam Dale
[35:06] coming to see Jesus coming and they
[35:10] share to hear the music Amazing Grace
[35:13] and everybody starts chanting Jesus
[35:15] Jesus Jesus there's there's no other
[35:18] name that has as much power as a name of
[35:20] Jesus it's like just like the song said
[35:22] earlier there's there's no other name
[35:24] that that can draw a crowd that can that
[35:28] can strengthen somebody just just just
[35:30] saying his name and the devil's just
[35:32] backing up and just just kind of
[35:35] watching and he's starting to shake a
[35:37] little bit he's a little nervous like I
[35:38] was last night when brother Sam said
[35:39] you're preaching in the morning yeah
[35:41] he's starting to shake and back up and
[35:43] kind of cower down as brother Ron says
[35:46] boo devil every time he says boob devil
[35:49] he gets smaller so that when they
[35:52] introduced Satan everybody was saying
[35:53] boo you know except for his little crowd
[35:55] over in the corner they were always a
[35:56] bunch of groupies you know there and as
[36:01] we enter the ring to fight for that
[36:03] problem that we have we have he's not
[36:05] he's not really looking at us he's
[36:06] looking at the trainer behind us he's
[36:09] looking at that who we represent who's
[36:11] behind those who's in our corner he's
[36:14] looking to to see what is he doing here
[36:17] why I wanted to fight them not him why
[36:20] why is he then when when the bell rings
[36:23] to fight now we're we're in the heat of
[36:25] the fight right now many of us are in
[36:28] the battle right now in the middle of a
[36:29] battle we feel like we're getting that
[36:32] rear ends wore out and fair like we'll
[36:34] feel like there's no hope there's no
[36:36] there's no chance of us recovering no
[36:39] chance of us coming back but just just
[36:42] keep pushing through cuz we know like I
[36:44] said we know the end of the book we know
[36:46] we know who wins he may win a battle now
[36:48] and again but we've already won the war
[36:51] brother Branham says in the contest he
[36:54] said Oh surely see there you come just
[36:56] that much
[36:57] surely you won't die but God said you
[36:59] would and that settles it and that that
[37:02] broke the great tug of war then and
[37:04] pulled the whole human race in the death
[37:06] because he listened to a reasoning
[37:08] against God's Word now it's now it's a
[37:11] shame that she did it but it's done past
[37:13] now we're still fortified and that link
[37:17] was made up with me in Christ Jesus we
[37:20] know that God gave us our best defense
[37:22] just simply trust his word don't reason
[37:25] with the devil that's what he does when
[37:27] he fights you he reasons with you your
[37:29] brother Donnie you're not you're not
[37:31] getting what you need you're you keep
[37:33] praying but you're not as nothing's
[37:34] going to happen you know there's there's
[37:37] no sense in wasting your time praying
[37:39] there's no sense in wasting your time
[37:40] coming to church you know I know I know
[37:42] everybody has that battle we think they
[37:44] might good enough to be a Christian am I
[37:46] good enough for the Lord you know and
[37:48] there's there's times where he almost
[37:51] wins but then you remember what you read
[37:54] in the in the Bible what brother Branham
[37:56] said John 3:16 for God so loved Nate
[37:59] Greene that He gave His only begotten
[38:01] Son and that just that just lifts you up
[38:04] and builds all your strength back to
[38:06] fight a little more push through and
[38:09] don't let don't let him know you're
[38:10] getting tired meaningful many fighters
[38:11] they they make that mistake of showing
[38:13] their their tired
[38:14] showing their getting weaker their
[38:16] they're not where they were they was at
[38:19] the beginning of the fight but don't
[38:21] don't give him that inch that he needs
[38:23] to take that mile oh all of a sudden
[38:27] we're getting our second wind we're
[38:30] getting ready to start fighting again
[38:31] we're getting ready to start putting
[38:33] them on the ground we've we've read
[38:36] we've read the word we
[38:37] got those vitamins we took a break
[38:39] during the intermission or whatever and
[38:42] we've got our feet under us again after
[38:44] being knocked to and fro and just being
[38:49] pretty much blindsided that we we've
[38:53] come to the we've come to the
[38:54] realization that we still have some
[38:56] fight left in all of a sudden the tables
[39:01] have turned and now we're whaling on him
[39:05] one brother told me after I prayed I
[39:07] preached this to home a few weeks ago he
[39:08] told me he said you could also refer to
[39:10] that as a tag-team match when you get
[39:11] tired just tag Jesus in and I bout
[39:14] shouted all he told me that during
[39:15] service he was leading song service and
[39:18] I said I thought of that but I didn't
[39:20] come out but I saved it for next time
[39:24] you start you started hitting him with
[39:26] those combinations start left and right
[39:29] left and right he hit him with the first
[39:31] Peter 2 and for 2 and 24 left hand then
[39:35] you come back and hit him with a excuse
[39:39] me in my notes guys messed up hit him
[39:41] with that mark 16 right hook tell him
[39:43] then you can finish him off with by his
[39:45] stripes I'm healed uppercut it's there's
[39:50] there's so many combinations that you
[39:52] can throw at him that back when I was a
[39:55] little kid we'd play video games and
[39:57] stuff and and we'd have cheat codes or
[39:59] combinations that would match sin and
[40:01] stuff and then we automatically kill the
[40:03] other guy or beat him up he's mostly
[40:05] fighting games and that's probably where
[40:06] my attitude came from by the end he's
[40:12] down for the count and he's not gonna
[40:13] get back up the referees already
[40:15] counting him out he's not getting back
[40:17] up he'll be he'll be back to fight you
[40:19] another time but this time he's not
[40:20] getting up you've won that fight and
[40:23] you've collected that prize that that
[40:24] healing or deliverance or that that back
[40:28] slid child that you've been praying for
[40:30] word now now it's time to celebrate now
[40:32] it's time to claim the victory celebrate
[40:36] now when you go back to the locker room
[40:40] afterwards and the coach is talking to
[40:42] you the trainer he's he's saying you did
[40:44] a good you put up a good fight you you
[40:47] you won you really proud of you
[40:51] showed your training today you showed
[40:53] what you've been working for and he asks
[40:57] if there's anything else he can do to
[41:00] help you start the next fight and I'm
[41:02] gonna read this quote here I told you I
[41:04] wasn't be long I tried to hold it out
[41:05] for brother Wade so he wouldn't have to
[41:06] a hard time this evening but but I'm
[41:09] gonna read this quote here from
[41:11] identification in 1964
[41:13] now sometimes faith is unknown to you
[41:16] you got it and you don't know it if you
[41:19] try to push yourself into something and
[41:21] you miss it you go over the top of it
[41:23] it's so humble and simple see and here's
[41:26] the high priest that can be touched by
[41:28] our infirmities then if you touched him
[41:30] he would act like he did before is that
[41:33] right now watch now this this is awesome
[41:37] right you see this woman sitting right
[41:39] down here I don't know the little soul
[41:40] she's just sitting there but somehow she
[41:43] is in contact with God because in the
[41:46] dimension that I'm now looking in I see
[41:48] the woman and she's conscious that
[41:51] something is going on she is praying for
[41:53] her children who was not here that is
[41:55] right I don't know her I've never seen
[41:57] the woman but she was deeply concerned
[41:59] about some children do you believe me to
[42:01] be his servant do you believe that Jesus
[42:03] Christ is here the Holy Spirit who you
[42:06] see if we can get ourselves out of the
[42:07] way see now to heal you I can't see or
[42:11] give you or to give you your desire I
[42:13] can't see that has to come through God
[42:15] unless he would tell me to tell you
[42:17] something now but if he can reveal to me
[42:20] what's the matter with that child or
[42:21] whatever it is you you will believe me
[42:23] to be a servant you will skip on down
[42:26] says yes the lady has three children she
[42:29] is praying for and all three of them is
[42:31] shadow that is they're not Christians
[42:34] they're unsaved that is right one of
[42:36] them is a girl and she has a sore on her
[42:39] leg up high that's right isn't it wants
[42:41] something wrong with her eyes one of the
[42:42] boys another one has got heart trouble
[42:44] and as an alcoholic that's true is that
[42:47] your desire is that what you want from
[42:49] God the sister says amen then I ask in
[42:51] Jesus name that he gives you what your
[42:54] desire is do you need anything else
[42:57] man when I heard that like in about
[43:00] shouted all through my office that's
[43:04] that's how awesome my god is that's
[43:06] that's how awesome my trainer is do you
[43:09] need anything else to help you with the
[43:10] next fight but you need anything else
[43:12] that's like sister June when she cooks
[43:14] you breakfast in the morning or supper
[43:17] and evening let me go this round when
[43:18] she cooks you supper in the evening and
[43:20] you get home off that Miller out and
[43:22] she's got your clothes laid out on the
[43:23] bed for you take a shower and put your
[43:25] pajamas on for the evening
[43:26] and she's got supper laid out on the
[43:27] table and you eat and you're sitting a
[43:29] recliner read a newspaper or whatever I
[43:32] know that don't happen in my house
[43:34] either but but she asked is there
[43:41] anything else I can do for you there's I
[43:43] mean this month still in training we
[43:47] have been married now she'll get me
[43:53] after a while but that's alright she's
[43:55] she's a preacher's wife now but is is
[43:58] there anything else that I can do for
[44:00] you is there anything else that God can
[44:03] do for you today
[44:03] there's there's nothing no requests no
[44:06] no thing that you can ask that's too big
[44:10] for too small for God like the like the
[44:13] like the the story goes the man went up
[44:16] to heaven and he sees the conveyor belt
[44:18] with all the small boxes going and going
[44:20] down to earth as a bunch of big boxes
[44:22] stacked up in a corner this is what are
[44:24] the what are the little boxes for and
[44:27] the angels tell them say that's the
[44:29] people's request that's what they've
[44:30] asked for they're sending them down to
[44:32] him he said well what does the big box
[44:35] is for us she said those are the the
[44:36] angel said those are the big the big
[44:38] problems the big circumstances that
[44:39] nobody ever asked for because they think
[44:41] they're too big for God don't don't
[44:44] think anything's too big for God don't
[44:45] think any fight any problem any any
[44:48] circumstance that you may face it's not
[44:51] too big for my god if if your God ain't
[44:55] doing it try mine there's there's
[44:58] there's nothing nothing that my god
[45:00] can't do that's we've we've been made
[45:03] more than conquerors through the blood
[45:06] of Jesus Christ only and and that's
[45:08] that's all it takes is just that blood
[45:10] to to cover us and we can defeat
[45:13] anything we can defeat any foe that the
[45:16] devil tries to throw against
[45:17] is any problem it may take a while it
[45:19] may be a long battle but just think
[45:22] during that battle you're getting
[45:23] trained you're getting you're getting
