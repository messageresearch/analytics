[46:13] coming just a couple of announcements
[46:16] number
[46:17] one I really thought that my wife was
[46:21] holding secrets for
[46:23] me it wasn't June that has vertigo it's
[46:28] Julie Mr Julie cramp CU she's sitting
[46:31] downstairs and she said that wasn't for
[46:33] June that was for me so brother
[46:35] Ryan Julie not juny cuz that scared me
[46:40] to death I talked to June this morning
[46:41] and they're in the Poconos and she's got
[46:43] to drive back and then fly back home
[46:44] tonight uh with the girls and she never
[46:48] told me
[46:49] that so I was a bit upset there for a
[46:51] moment but uh that all got cleared up so
[46:55] uh it's all an interpretation
[46:57] right remember Wednesday night brother
[47:00] Lis will be
[47:01] here we are leaving tomorrow uh when
[47:05] June comes back uh we have a cabin in
[47:07] the mountain for about four or five days

[47:11] time it's our anniversary next Sunday so
[47:15] 45
[47:17] years all all her not me amen amen amen
[47:23] that's all right sister Regina I'm glad
[47:25] you're excited about something
[47:27] so we're going to the mountains for a
[47:29] few days and we won't be here Wednesday
[47:30] night but we sure will be streaming in
[47:32] if we can um brother Aaron is at brother
[47:36] um Dutch Scott um remember next Sunday
[47:40] now brother uh Andre head will be here
[47:44] brother Bob's going to go speak for him
[47:45] up there and if some of you saw the
[47:47] pictures of what's going on up there it
[47:49] is totally
[47:50] devastating what's going on um up there
[47:53] took stevenh and Janice they had to go
[47:55] around the world and they going to have
[47:56] to go around to go world to go back home
[47:58] because a lot of places are totally gone

[48:06] we really dodged the bullet here we
[48:08] didn't have any problem at all we thank
[48:10] God for that but we also want to have
[48:12] sincere prayer for those people that I
[48:15] think right now there's a total of 70
[48:17] something people that they can't find uh
[48:19] scattered up in North Carolina in
[48:20] Tennessee that they haven't even been
[48:22] able to find besides the on they have
[48:24] some got swept away but
[48:29] um folks this is just a dropping a
[48:33] bucket to what's
[48:35] coming I don't want to scare you it is
[48:38] but this is a Dro in the
[48:40] bucket with what's coming especially the
[48:43] United States when when California
[48:45] sinks this won't even be
[48:49] remembered so let's get into what our
[48:51] refuge
[48:53] today the greatest thing we can you know
[48:55] I I saw the other day that some of the
[48:57] millionaires are taking these these big
[48:59] old uh silos and they've took the
[49:01] missiles out of it but the but the rich
[49:03] people are building houses underneath it
[49:06] Apartments so they can make it through
[49:07] the make it through the U the nuclear
[49:10] explosion or whatever it is
[49:13] but give me Eagle
[49:16] wings give me
[49:19] feathers I'll take feathers anytime if
[49:22] it's under his wing I'll promise you you
[49:24] can't dig a hole deep enough to get away
[49:27] from God so we're going to listen today
[49:31] to the word of the Lord couple more
[49:33] announcements real quick next Sunday
[49:36] brother Andre will be with us we'll
[49:38] still just have one service though but
[49:39] we will have communion and foot washing
[49:41] after that first service next Sunday

[50:03] $20 and maybe put some bins in there Ben

[50:18] for the berry coffee and we can they can
[50:22] make a book for 8 cents and they can
[50:24] make a church age book for 86 cents
[50:27] so for a dollar your $20 go a long
[50:31] way but bring your money if you want to
[50:34] write a check as we've always said for
[50:36] All These Years brother Dell said if you
[50:39] want to write a check and run it through

[50:54] opportunity to to maybe take a little
[50:56] bit more your taxes but I'm not going to
[50:58] worry about that I'm just going to give

[1:01:02] believe a Christian in this day is just
[1:01:04] a Christian as days gone by we're not
[1:01:07] called to be Christians so-called we've
[1:01:10] watered down Christianity so much it's
[1:01:12] pathetic that's what's Happ people pass

[1:02:18] keep me on track am because my mind will
[1:02:20] get going you know you try to put too
[1:02:22] much in but let's go to First Peter
[1:02:27] okay I I asked brother Louise could he
[1:02:30] understand Tennessee
[1:02:32] Tennessee he's having a hard time
[1:02:34] speaking Tennessee and I understand I
[1:02:36] understand that if I say yans that means
[1:02:40] you all so I just but you know I am what
[1:02:44] I am you know and um but there's one
[1:02:48] thing about it I know where I come
[1:02:52] from and we finish up today see that's
[1:02:54] what's so hard sometimes Terence you can
[1:02:56] remember what I used to be you could way
[1:02:59] can remember what I used to be amen but
[1:03:02] I'm going to tell you when I end up
[1:03:03] today you may find out I've been the
[1:03:06] self-same person all the time come on
[1:03:09] all right so let's just read this and
[1:03:11] get get going it's about time to quit
[1:03:12] here I Ain got
[1:03:14] started first First Peter 1 elect
[1:03:18] according to the four knowledge of God
[1:03:20] that's the only way like brother that's
[1:03:22] the only way you're predestinated is
[1:03:24] through the for knowledge of God now let
[1:03:26] me explain here for you young people I
[1:03:29] know it's not a use service but just
[1:03:30] think about it this way in in um future
[1:03:33] home brother Brandon was talking about
[1:03:35] for knowledge he said let me show you
[1:03:37] how for knowledge works let me explain
[1:03:40] how for knowledge of God works and he
[1:03:43] starts to talk about the Visions so let
[1:03:45] me just do it this way brother Brandon
[1:03:47] would see a vision he'd see he'd see the
[1:03:50] vision of what was going to happen in
[1:03:51] somebody's home he would say he'd say
[1:03:54] this lady's going to come in with a
[1:03:56] brown coat
[1:03:57] on going to have a brown coat on there's
[1:04:00] a hat that's on top of the coffee table
[1:04:03] right there's a husband's here a child's
[1:04:06] over here there's a sick woman here I
[1:04:08] see that sick woman get well all right
[1:04:12] so what happens is brother Brandon's in
[1:04:14] the home he's seen the vision he knows
[1:04:16] what's going to happen God's for
[1:04:18] knowledge has showed him what's going to
[1:04:20] happen that's what so you God know in
[1:04:22] other words God knows the end from the
[1:04:24] beginning that's that's the only thing
[1:04:26] it ain't you are special it's God knows
[1:04:28] the end from the beginning so God's so
[1:04:30] brother Brandon's in the vision he's
[1:04:32] there in the home now brother collie
[1:04:33] he's there there's no woman there with a
[1:04:36] brown coat on that's
[1:04:37] right right the hat is sitting on the
[1:04:40] kitchen table it ain't on the coffee
[1:04:43] table the little kid over here is laying
[1:04:45] there dying sick brother Brandon wants
[1:04:48] to heal pray for the sick child but the
[1:04:50] vision he can't do it why God's forign
[1:04:53] knowledge just said certain things have
[1:04:54] to be so from this remember you can't
[1:04:57] God change God's
[1:04:59] word all right you can't change his word
[1:05:02] you can't change his mind you can't so
[1:05:03] brother Brandon here he was a word
[1:05:05] Prophet greatest Prophet God's ever had
[1:05:06] on this Earth in my opinion not just a
[1:05:08] word Prophet a church age messenger all
[1:05:11] right so here he was he saw the vision
[1:05:13] he couldn't say well God I can't wait
[1:05:15] for the hat to get moved I can't wait
[1:05:17] for the woman to get I got to get this
[1:05:18] he couldn't do that he had to wait
[1:05:21] sister he had to wait so about that time
[1:05:23] somebody knocks on the door
[1:05:26] well there's sister Betty with her Brown
[1:05:28] coat on well sister June over here says
[1:05:30] Lord have mercy sister Betty where'd you
[1:05:32] get that brown coat at I I just stopped
[1:05:35] I saw a sign down there and they said
[1:05:36] they was having a sale and I just bought
[1:05:38] this brown coat never owned the brown
[1:05:41] coat but God knew she's going to have
[1:05:42] that brown coat on brother Brandon knew
[1:05:44] she was right so she gets the brown coat
[1:05:47] on here she comes walking in with it and
[1:05:49] while she do she just goes there sets
[1:05:52] the coat down there there the Hat
[1:05:53] sitting on the cof on the table she
[1:05:55] picks the the Hat up and set you on the
[1:05:56] coffee table yeah brother Brandon didn't
[1:05:59] have one thing to do with it but what
[1:06:02] happened he could then go and pray for
[1:06:04] the child there's for knowledge you
[1:06:08] can't make it happen what God knew it
[1:06:11] would happen and it just happens all
[1:06:13] right so like brother Bob said God
[1:06:15] brings things together but God don't
[1:06:17] make you do nothing he didn't put you
[1:06:19] through a pipe it's free moral agency
[1:06:22] every bit of it's what you choose to do
[1:06:23] with it all right all right so now let's
[1:06:25] stay with this right here because it's
[1:06:26] by the elect according to the four
[1:06:28] knowledge of God the Father through
[1:06:30] sanctification of the spirit under
[1:06:31] obedience the sprink of the blood of

[1:12:30] was the old book is gone that book of
[1:12:34] life you a you can't find your name in
[1:12:36] that book of life no more brother Dy me
[1:12:39] you young people let me give you an
[1:12:40] example I can read in the Bible and I
[1:12:42] can read it to you how many of have you
[1:12:45] ever read about Abraham everybody picks
[1:12:46] on the women many ever read about Sarah
[1:12:48] laughing God everybody's heard that what
[1:12:51] about your father Abraham sister Peggy
[1:12:54] when was m
[1:12:56] Elohim self-existing God talking to M
[1:13:00] talking to Abraham said you're going to
[1:13:02] have a child what Abraham do he didn't
[1:13:04] stand and laugh like Sarah did he laid
[1:13:06] on the ground and
[1:13:07] laughed laid on the ground and laughed
[1:13:11] then he went down to there the king
[1:13:13] thought he's going to try to save his
[1:13:14] own hi brother Gary what'd he do he said
[1:13:17] take take her she's my sister you can
[1:13:19] have her now listen don't you do
[1:13:23] that but let me ask you something
[1:13:25] something brother Bob read in the Bible
[1:13:28] show me in the Bible where Sarah and
[1:13:29] Abraham was ever
[1:13:31] changed on if he hadn't tried to give
[1:13:33] her away to the king how would you have
[1:13:35] ever known it why would a king want a
[1:13:38] granny when he could had every woman he
[1:13:40] wanted down there for 25 years why would
[1:13:42] he want a granny showing you right there
[1:13:44] in the word Right Between the Lines he'd
[1:13:46] been there' been changed if he hadn't
[1:13:48] done it to BR would never seen that's
[1:13:50] what they speaking of think about it now
[1:13:52] it's exactly what happened but than look
[1:13:54] here young people there was Abraham done
[1:13:58] those things look horrible so you got
[1:14:01] there's the let's just take it this way
[1:14:03] there is The Book of Life That's wrote
[1:14:04] about it but after Calvary when you read
[1:14:07] the New Testament read Romans 4 said I
[1:14:10] get down and out and start feeling sorry
[1:14:11] for myself I said I turned to Romans 4
[1:14:14] what happened in Romans 4 Abraham
[1:14:15] staggered not you can't find when the
[1:14:18] Holy Ghost started right brother colie
[1:14:20] they said brother collie did you can't
[1:14:22] find it written anywhere by the Holy
[1:14:24] Ghost and he did that you can't find
[1:14:26] where Abraham ever staggered or fell so
[1:14:29] you see what I'm saying see what the
[1:14:30] blood of Jesus Christ will do to a
[1:14:32] person it has nothing to do with the
[1:14:35] past it has everything to do with today
[1:14:37] hey man that's exactly what it is I
[1:14:39] ain't even got to my scripture being
[1:14:40] born again not of corruptible seed but
[1:14:42] of
[1:14:43] Incorruptible that's your inheritance
[1:14:45] that's what was reserved in heaven see
[1:14:47] that's the beauty of it God knew like
[1:14:49] brother B said that word will cross your
[1:14:51] path he knew what you'd do with it would
[1:14:53] crossed your path yes sir sure no you
[1:14:55] didn't have it when you got in this
[1:14:56] world you come between Satan and Eve is

[1:15:37] day and feel this he had birthed I read
[1:15:41] spoke word Original Seed there's your
[1:15:42] faith of the fathers there's your faith

[1:15:46] father he he's built it back he's build
[1:15:49] it back to Holy Spirit he's right there
[1:15:51] he's standing exactly where Paul stood

[1:15:56] limb what John say stood the same place
[1:15:59] brother call he had the baptism Holy
[1:16:00] Ghost 60 years what' John say all's lost
[1:16:05] we're just going to go back to Cosmic
[1:16:06] life all's lost what Paul say we go
[1:16:10] under Perfection if God permits but God
[1:16:13] didn't permit it so you got to go on so
[1:16:16] what happened the Holy Ghost told
[1:16:18] Brother Bron said pick up your pen
[1:16:19] Prophet pick up your pen and write amen
[1:16:22] what did he write The Law of
[1:16:24] reproduction
[1:16:25] then what did he get into he said as of
[1:16:27] yet as of yet Malachi 4 has not been
[1:16:32] fulfilled all right but I'm here to tell
[1:16:34] you it's being
[1:16:36] fulfilled Malachi 4 is being fulfilled
[1:16:39] all right all right so let me let me get
[1:16:42] by if Incorruptible by the word of God
[1:16:44] which liveth and abideth forever amen
[1:16:47] all right that's what was reserved in
[1:16:49] heaven for you all right so real quick
[1:16:53] now Romans
[1:16:55] 10 how you going to get
[1:16:59] it verse verse
[1:17:03] six but the righteousness which is of
[1:17:05] faith speaketh on this wise so
[1:17:08] righteousness of faith has a voice it
[1:17:12] can talk oh yeah it
[1:17:16] speaks here's what it says it says not
[1:17:19] speaking on it say not in thine heart
[1:17:21] who shall Ascend into heaven in other
[1:17:23] words it don't say it's in heaven
[1:17:25] waiting for
[1:17:27] me no it ain't
[1:17:31] that who shall Ascend into heaven that
[1:17:33] is to bring Christ down from above or
[1:17:36] who shall Ascend into the deep that is
[1:17:38] to bring Christ again from the dead but
[1:17:40] what saith it what does the righteous of
[1:17:43] Faith
[1:17:45] say the word well that's what you
[1:17:47] bypassed that's what was reserved in
[1:17:49] heaven for
[1:17:51] youen is n thee even in thy mouth and in
[1:17:54] th my
[1:17:55] heart now it's still you it's still
[1:17:59] talking to you so you say why my pastor
[1:18:01] got this it don't matter what your
[1:18:03] pastor's got if it ain't in you it don't
[1:18:06] matter what any man don't matter what
[1:18:07] any man's got if it ain't in you because
[1:18:10] the gospel of the your salvation comes
[1:18:12] through the mouth of somebody that's the
[1:18:14] only way you get it after you hear the
[1:18:17] gospel of your that's the only way you
[1:18:19] get it you that's why that's the way man
[1:18:22] chose all right so but but what sayith
[1:18:25] the word is neither even in thy mouth in
[1:18:27] thy heart that is the word of faith
[1:18:29] which we preach that if Thou shalt
[1:18:32] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:18:33] shall confess thine heart the god of the
[1:18:35] raising from the dead Thou shalt be
[1:18:36] saved now don't take this the wrong way
[1:18:39] that scripture has deceived more people
[1:18:42] than any scripture in the Bible in my
[1:18:43] opinion amen and I don't mean the
[1:18:45] scriptures deceiving because it's not
[1:18:47] it's the way it's interpreted to people
[1:18:49] just call upon the name of the Lord
[1:18:50] you're saved and live like the devil the
[1:18:52] rest of the time that ain't what it is
[1:18:54] it's when the very life of Jesus Christ
[1:18:56] comes in you and express itself through
[1:18:59] you oh we got signs and water that's
[1:19:01] wonderful it ain't over signs and
[1:19:03] wonders brother colie it's over the word
[1:19:05] the showdowns over the word all right
[1:19:08] what is Thou shalt for with the m with
[1:19:10] the heart man believeth you don't stop
[1:19:12] you keep believing unto righteousness
[1:19:15] and with a mouth confession is made to
[1:19:16] Salvation for the scripture say
[1:19:17] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:19:19] ashamed let me stop skip on down here
[1:19:21] real quick verse 14 how then shall they
[1:19:23] call in whom theyve not not believed
[1:19:25] here was Paul up there met that you not
[1:19:27] Paul Phillip now he was up there having
[1:19:30] a good time he at a red hot Revival
[1:19:32] wasn't he they seeing a lot of wonderful
[1:19:35] things and people say all these things
[1:19:36] about brother Brandon you know people
[1:19:38] leave the message people know what they
[1:19:39] want to oh he wasn't there you think
[1:19:41] they have believed Philip been picked up
[1:19:43] and taken 300 miles down the road I
[1:19:45] doubt they believed that if they lived
[1:19:46] back there sister Peggy they wouldn't
[1:19:48] have believed it but it happened so let
[1:19:51] me tell you young people something else
[1:19:52] you say I'm a Christian then you're a
[1:19:54] fanatic
[1:19:55] you believe in the fanatical you have to
[1:19:58] believe in the fanatical you Liv in the
[1:20:00] days of Noah they said it's never rained
[1:20:02] you said it's going to rain you Liv in
[1:20:04] the days of Abraham you say Abraham
[1:20:06] you're too old to make a baby I'm going
[1:20:07] to have a baby Sarah you can't have a
[1:20:09] baby I'll have a baby you have to
[1:20:11] believe in the fanatical that is close
[1:20:14] so so now you're living the day he that
[1:20:16] liveth and believeth in this shall never
[1:20:18] die well well sister Peggy from the time
[1:20:21] these babies are born we teach them to
[1:20:22] scared to death of death time they're
[1:20:25] able to crawl we're scared we're gonna
[1:20:26] drop them on their soft spot we're
[1:20:27] scared we prob putting plugins in the
[1:20:30] Sid so they won't stick their fingers
[1:20:31] and from the day we're born we're
[1:20:33] programmed to be scared to
[1:20:35] death but now we're trying to be
[1:20:37] reprogrammed to teach us death has no
[1:20:40] place here that's what we got to be
[1:20:42] programmed with the word of God is
[1:20:44] Incorruptible it's undefiled it sh
[1:20:46] fadeth not away that's what's being
[1:20:49] formed in you not in
[1:20:51] heaven don't believe that your theop is
[1:20:54] not in heaven
[1:20:55] your Theo is your soul what listen list
[1:20:58] not you if somebody sitting here this
[1:21:00] morning brother and they they never been
[1:21:02] born again they hear the word of God you
[1:21:04] know what they're hearing from they
[1:21:06] theop you know why they're hearing from
[1:21:08] not it's in heaven it's coming through
[1:21:11] my mouth what is your theophany it's a
[1:21:13] word body so what is the birth of the
[1:21:16] word it's that word somebody speaks God
[1:21:18] quickens in your heart not in your heart
[1:21:21] it makes your heart the word there you
[1:21:23] see you bypass that you bypass that word
[1:21:28] listen that's why I look like I do
[1:21:31] that's why I told somebody the other day
[1:21:33] I don't care to be
[1:21:35] baldheaded if I went back when I go back
[1:21:37] but sister pegan I'm 18 year old
[1:21:38] whatever I won't be 18 I'll be like I
[1:21:41] was at 18 it won't be no years attached
[1:21:43] to it I don't care it wouldn't bother me
[1:21:46] to still be baldheaded but I'll be so
[1:21:49] glad to get rid of these
[1:21:51] things I mean that they they you sweat
[1:21:54] they get all over it you get out there
[1:21:56] cows is act rain it gets all you it's
[1:21:59] just a mess they're they aggravation but
[1:22:02] that's all if that's the worst thing I
[1:22:03] got in my life I got a good life you
[1:22:05] know so but you see what I'm saying I
[1:22:07] I'm sorry I I'm just
[1:22:10] excited the word of God is something to
[1:22:13] get excited about I'll get into
[1:22:14] something here in a minute we got we've
[1:22:16] got something brothers and sister I'm
[1:22:18] telling you if we'll come by the word
[1:22:20] now come by the word all right let me
[1:22:22] just get going here so you see
[1:22:26] how shall they call how then shall they
[1:22:28] call in whom they have not believed and
[1:22:30] how shall they believe in whom they have
[1:22:31] not heard and how shall they hear
[1:22:34] without a
[1:22:34] preacher all right I don't believe in a
[1:22:37] fivefold Ministry that ain't my
[1:22:40] problem they'll say sister Peggy they'll
[1:22:42] say brother brandham now listen Matthew
[1:22:45] 16 what they say Jesus said who do men
[1:22:47] say I the son of man am so what they
[1:22:51] say you're one of the prophets that's
[1:22:54] right was the very god terance of the
[1:22:56] prophets and they was making him a
[1:22:58] prophet so the people will say brother
[1:23:01] bradon's the five-fold
[1:23:02] ministry let me tell you something don't
[1:23:05] do that to
[1:23:06] him right don't make him a a fivefold
[1:23:10] Ministry Prophet right it sounds
[1:23:12] spiritual to say those things but that's
[1:23:15] brother Paul when he met those people up
[1:23:16] on the road you know what happened he
[1:23:18] knew right quick they wasn't coming by
[1:23:19] the word didn't he he knew they hadn't
[1:23:21] come his way they hadn't come the way he
[1:23:23] came he said have you received the Holy
[1:23:24] Ghost since you believe well he didn't
[1:23:26] know there'd be such a thing he didn't
[1:23:27] say he what wonderful brothers no he
[1:23:29] didn't he said he what he told him what
[1:23:30] to do and they received it that's the
[1:23:32] difference most now they received it so
[1:23:35] what so that's my point about people say
[1:23:36] brother Brown no sir don't make brother
[1:23:39] Brown just a fivefold Ministry you're
[1:23:41] you're you're demeaning his office and I
[1:23:43] don't mean the five4 ministry is deme
[1:23:45] don't miss don't misunderstand me but he
[1:23:47] is a word prophet he don't answer to
[1:23:50] nobody but God I do he don't he doesn't
[1:23:55] all right but I'm going to tell you
[1:23:56] something this ministry down here does
[1:23:59] something that he couldn't finish and
[1:24:01] that's unite The Head and the body
[1:24:03] together we'll get to that if I go it's
[1:24:05] 12:00 and we Ain even
[1:24:08] started oh goodness see all right so how
[1:24:11] shall they preach except they be sent
[1:24:13] now brother Ram said he said you'll
[1:24:14] believe John 3:16 what about John
[1:24:18] 2019 huh he said I challenge you to
[1:24:20] believe that as if as my father sent me
[1:24:23] even so send I you and if he sent me
[1:24:26] here today and I had to come a long way
[1:24:28] to get here if he sent me here today he
[1:24:30] sent me here for
[1:24:32] somebody he had me come for somebody all
[1:24:35] right so so the word has come for
[1:24:37] somebody so you you got to be the one
[1:24:39] that says that's for me I need a new
[1:24:42] birth I need I need this I need that
[1:24:44] whatever it is you have need of it's in
[1:24:46] the word of God that spoke to you today
[1:24:48] all right so let so what how how can
[1:24:50] they preach that they be S as it is
[1:24:52] written how beautiful the feet of them
[1:24:53] that preach the gospel of peace and
[1:24:55] bring Glad Tidings of good things now
[1:24:56] remember this cuz we're going to finish
[1:24:58] with this here in a little while I'm
[1:24:59] going to try my best to go fast but they
[1:25:01] have not obeyed the gospel for Isaiah
[1:25:03] say Lord who ha believed our report
[1:25:05] that's right so then Faith cometh not
[1:25:08] comes
[1:25:11] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:25:13] word of God and the word of God Only You
[1:25:16] can't add the word in a Creed CU that
[1:25:19] body will not be built in a Creed it
[1:25:22] will not do it all right so I've got a l
[1:25:24] L the more scriptures I'll get to but
[1:25:26] we're just going to try to again so now
[1:25:28] stay with me okay Adam and Eve we know
[1:25:31] remember daddy preached that here a few
[1:25:32] months ago Adam and Eve put us across
[1:25:34] the chasm but there was a time there I
[1:25:37] could read the quotes I've got them all
[1:25:39] here I ain't going to take the time to
[1:25:40] do it because I'm GNA try to hurry I
[1:25:42] just get nervous I I can't help that I'm
[1:25:43] just I used to pick at my daddy and I
[1:25:46] shouldn't have done that cuz now I'm the
[1:25:47] same way you know you reap what you s I
[1:25:51] did Zach I said he'll see this I used to
[1:25:53] pick at about daddy why do you worry why
[1:25:55] do you worry you'll understand but I now
[1:25:57] I'm the same way I don't want to worry
[1:25:59] you out but I sure want you to get
[1:26:02] something I sure want you to get
[1:26:04] something I just want us free see the
[1:26:07] listen the Holy Ghost the message this
[1:26:11] Holy Ghost has been bound at the river
[1:26:15] been bound at the doors of Creeds and
[1:26:16] dogmas for nearly 2000 years but it's to
[1:26:19] be loosed by the end time message well
[1:26:21] listen then what's that mean brother
[1:26:23] Danny we're first
[1:26:24] it's loosed us we're listen whether you
[1:26:26] realize it or not we're in the Jubilee
[1:26:29] we're in the 70th we're in the final
[1:26:31] Jubilee it started in
[1:26:34] 1977 all right so we're in the time of
[1:26:37] release in other words it says brother
[1:26:39] Michael it says you know what you don't
[1:26:41] have to serve that Master no more that
[1:26:43] don't no body you don't have to serve
[1:26:45] that no more why Malachi 4 says a son of
[1:26:49] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:26:50] wings that ain't no healing Revival
[1:26:53] that's righten that's oh see everybody
[1:26:54] says Malachi 45 and 6 you Mali 4 no sir
[1:26:58] Malachi 4 it it takes us all the way to
[1:27:00] the Millennium through the change of the
[1:27:01] body Moses and Elijah's there the whole
[1:27:04] thing in Malachi for the fullness of the
[1:27:06] godhead bodies there all right I'll get
[1:27:08] to that here in a few minutes if I can
[1:27:09] get time but the thing about it now see
[1:27:12] there was a
[1:27:13] time there was no
[1:27:15] death no death across the CM there there
[1:27:19] was in the Garden of Eden they she
[1:27:20] didn't even have her name Eve her name
[1:27:22] was Adam she got a name she was living
[1:27:25] after she did what she did the Lutheran
[1:27:28] got their name Lutheran after they did
[1:27:30] what they did Sir the Baptist they got a
[1:27:33] name but they lost they name the name
[1:27:36] they lost their husband's name all right
[1:27:38] so so
[1:27:39] listen there was a time there death
[1:27:42] would have never got
[1:27:44] in there was a word there you that
[1:27:46] preach that right but see what Eve
[1:27:48] listen to the
[1:27:51] reason I'm already wearing myself out
[1:27:54] just stay with
[1:27:56] me see we as the Bible says we're grown
[1:27:58] this is the breach message it shows
[1:28:01] there something that we're not in our
[1:28:03] ought to be condition now listen like I
[1:28:05] said while ago when I was a
[1:28:07] sinner I wasn't groaning I was having a
[1:28:10] good time I thought it was I wasn't
[1:28:13] groaning right but it's after you're
[1:28:15] born again you s Joanna you start
[1:28:19] groaning cuz you're look your eye you
[1:28:21] got an upward pull before you just had a
[1:28:24] downward pull you didn't know no
[1:28:25] difference but now you've got an upward
[1:28:28] pull why the word has come to you all
[1:28:31] right so now look what happens you're
[1:28:33] groaning it shows there's something
[1:28:35] you're not in your right to be State
[1:28:37] you're not in your right to be
[1:28:39] conditioned you fall from somewhere now
[1:28:42] we don't need anybody to interpret that
[1:28:43] for us we know it was eternal life they
[1:28:45] fell from amen they lost her claims
[1:28:48] eternal life Adam and Eve eternal life
[1:28:50] death in the Garden of Eden brought all
[1:28:52] nature under them to death the tree died
[1:28:54] before that animal never died we know
[1:28:56] that it we cross this Chasm we're beyond
[1:28:58] the reach of God on the other side of
[1:28:59] the chasm he goes on talking about how
[1:29:01] this given free moral agency all right
[1:29:03] so we I'm I'm just going to preach and
[1:29:06] not read some of these quotes
[1:29:08] God here's the power of transformation
[1:29:11] 65 Birds didn't have to die the wolf and
[1:29:14] lamb were feeding together sounds like
[1:29:17] the Millennium doesn't it and the lion
[1:29:19] the leopard and Ox there was no killing
[1:29:21] no death no sorrow there was ad them
[1:29:25] male and female all she had to do is
[1:29:28] wait for her word husband to bring that
[1:29:30] word that they hadn't partook of what
[1:29:32] they was waiting for an oncoming promise
[1:29:34] she wasn't his wife
[1:29:36] yet they was an oncoming promise to her
[1:29:40] if they had waited now their youth was
[1:29:41] being renewed just that much was keeping
[1:29:44] their youth renewed but there's a part
[1:29:46] of that tree they hadn't eat from yet
[1:29:48] amen that was what going to change them
[1:29:51] to young people permanently Eternal
[1:29:53] people amen
[1:29:54] but they turned that word down that's
[1:29:57] the word they turned down so let me just
[1:29:58] paraphrase the save time that word they
[1:30:00] turned
[1:30:01] down that book the title deed to the
[1:30:05] earth now and that book went back to God
[1:30:10] Amen all right so now they didn't lose
[1:30:12] their salvation they didn't lose eternal
[1:30:13] life they failed from our eternal life
[1:30:15] In the Flesh all right so we know that
[1:30:18] but now look that book Let's just put
[1:30:20] this the Lamb's Book went back to God
[1:30:24] cuz it's a book of names it's the word
[1:30:26] of God it went back to God the original

[1:31:24] the quotes here when you're birthed to
[1:31:26] where brother Brandon was and that's
[1:31:27] where you have to be birthed to let me
[1:31:29] tell you where it's at same place Jesus
[1:31:31] Christ was birth to same place that's
[1:31:35] where it is you ain't going to
[1:31:36] die there's a fullness of the godhead
[1:31:39] bodily anointing on you you're not the
[1:31:41] fullest of godhead body don't
[1:31:42] misunderstand me but that anointing
[1:31:44] that's what left him in the Garden of
[1:31:45] Gethsemane he couldn't die listen how
[1:31:47] that anointing talked te this Temple
[1:31:50] down three days I'll raise it up that's
[1:31:53] what that you can't take my life I'll
[1:31:56] give it but you can't take it that's how
[1:31:58] it talks that's the way a Christian
[1:32:00] talks they ain't defeated think about it
[1:32:03] brother they ain't defeated are they
[1:32:05] they he ra what when enemy comes in like
[1:32:08] a flood what's he he raises up a
[1:32:09] standard listen so stay with me now and
[1:32:12] pray for me so look that went back to
[1:32:15] God it wound up in the womb of Mary it
[1:32:18] there was Mary birthed the very word of
[1:32:20] God in the beginning was the word and
[1:32:21] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:32:23] made flesh Mary had nothing to do with
[1:32:25] we know that but there was the book
[1:32:27] there see it was the book he didn't he
[1:32:30] in the book of life that's when it what
[1:32:32] it came in after the
[1:32:35] fall The Book of Life came in after the
[1:32:37] fall Lamb's Book never had no beginning
[1:32:40] that Lamb's Book sister Peggy had no
[1:32:41] beginning of days or end of life he
[1:32:44] never had no beginning of days or end of
[1:32:45] life no sir so what happened it brought
[1:32:48] us all here across the chasm we know
[1:32:51] that I'm just going so so here we are
[1:32:54] born across the casine no hope y
[1:32:57] lost no different Adolf
[1:33:00] Hitler the only difference that little
[1:33:02] woman at the well like brother B say
[1:33:04] that little woman at the well and them
[1:33:06] far them Pharisees down there that lived
[1:33:08] a whole lot better life than she did the
[1:33:11] only one difference between them was
[1:33:12] what representation of predestination
[1:33:15] what was it God's forign knowledge
[1:33:17] knowing what she would do with the word
[1:33:19] and what they would do with it and when
[1:33:21] it crossed their path they knew they'd
[1:33:23] make it above and it blacked their name
[1:33:25] out that's how important it is young
[1:33:27] people and old people alike not to turn
[1:33:29] the word down cuz when you turn that
[1:33:31] word down that blacks your name your
[1:33:32] name comes out of the book of life he
[1:33:34] said most Gentiles names come
[1:33:36] out you don't want to come out you want
[1:33:39] to
[1:33:40] transfer now when brother brand saying
[1:33:42] transfer brother Bob he's not saying oh
[1:33:44] it was always in the L's book He's just
[1:33:46] telling you what you've been born again
[1:33:49] you're now expressing the Lamb's Book
[1:33:51] you're now expressing what what you in
[1:33:54] God all the time all right so now say
[1:33:56] with me so they were we were born the
[1:33:58] original word had nothing to do with it
[1:34:00] but the original word came to the Mary
[1:34:03] right when that original word he what he
[1:34:06] started talking l a corn a week die he
[1:34:09] abide alone all right so he ain't going
[1:34:11] to abide alone because the promise go
[1:34:14] God predestinated the world of Sons and
[1:34:16] Daughters of God that's what he
[1:34:18] predestinated that's the whole plan and
[1:34:20] purpose that's what Adam and Eve turned
[1:34:22] that down here come the Lord Jesus what
[1:34:25] to bring that into fruition all right so
[1:34:27] then he had the his ministry that's son
[1:34:29] of man Ministry brother said you got to

[1:35:00] through Seven Ages Son of God through
[1:35:02] Seven
[1:35:02] Ages all right but there's a brother

[1:35:08] there there's a
[1:35:10] conjunction there's a conjunction in

[1:35:17] to be brought to you and I to at the
[1:35:19] revelation of Jesus Christ there is the

[1:37:40] start reading who that's my glory why
[1:37:43] why it's yours it's yours he's give it
[1:37:46] to you see that's what the Revelation is
[1:37:48] it's yours so don't let anybody tell you
[1:37:50] you don't have to understand you're too
[1:37:51] young you're not too young the Holy
[1:37:53] Ghost is the revealer of the word it's
[1:37:54] not
[1:37:55] you you're never too young or too old to
[1:37:58] understand God as long as he's the one
[1:37:59] doing the revealing see what's wrong is
[1:38:02] we want the people to be educated in it
[1:38:05] ever learning we don't need to be ever
[1:38:07] learning we need to be ever receiving
[1:38:09] Revelation long for God long for god
[1:38:13] let's don't forget Revelation cuz that's
[1:38:15] the only thing that Revelation is going
[1:38:16] to take you out of here so you young
[1:38:18] people says I just they get into second
[1:38:21] pool third one we're going to get into
[1:38:22] something here in a minute that pool
[1:38:23] third pool whatever let me tell you
[1:38:25] something how many young people here
[1:38:26] knows what two plus two is don't be
[1:38:29] afraid to raise your
[1:38:31] hand there was a time you
[1:38:34] didn't but you kept going to school sir
[1:38:38] now if I walked in you know my daughters
[1:38:41] are older now but if I walked in the
[1:38:43] house and they still had a pacifier in
[1:38:44] their mouth at 26 years old and they
[1:38:46] still in the third grade I'd be worried
[1:38:48] brother
[1:38:49] colie I'd be worried about them Paul
[1:38:52] says what he come to give us skill
[1:38:54] Daniel said he come to give us skill and
[1:38:58] understanding the Holy Ghost came to the
[1:39:00] same reason get the new birth and you'll
[1:39:02] get an understanding I promise you that
[1:39:03] God will reveal himself to you but what
[1:39:05] happens you understand two plus two is
[1:39:08] four that's a silly Inc carnal but it's
[1:39:10] help you understand two plus two is
[1:39:12] four well then all of a sudden brother
[1:39:14] Donnie this teacher says you know what
[1:39:15] we're going to do today we're going to
[1:39:17] add a little bit to that what's two plus
[1:39:19] two plus
[1:39:20] two well then you start scrap well
[1:39:23] getting your fingers and toes out well
[1:39:25] that's
[1:39:26] six well then the next year you're going
[1:39:28] to go they're going to move you up a
[1:39:30] grade they're GNA say what's two time
[1:39:36] three you know what that is that's the
[1:39:38] same thing as two plus 2 plus two so get
[1:39:41] the
[1:39:43] foundation the foundation was two plus
[1:39:45] two if you don't get the foundation
[1:39:48] right I guarantee you ain't going to get
[1:39:49] the multiplication or division anything
[1:39:51] else right so that my point is this get
[1:39:54] the new birth and get into the word
[1:39:57] listen to the word get into the word cuz
[1:39:59] when you hear something wrong there has
[1:40:01] to be one inside of you that let you
[1:40:03] know that ain't right that's what you
[1:40:06] have to have you got to have the one let
[1:40:07] me tell you brother Brandon sit in his
[1:40:09] room I'm just going ahead and get this
[1:40:10] and get it over with brother Brandon
[1:40:12] sitting there in his room he said as yet
[1:40:15] Malachi 4 ain't been fulfilled right
[1:40:17] he's sitting there in his room on that
[1:40:20] first seal Y come on he
[1:40:24] said I would have made not a mistake a
[1:40:30] horrible mistake if he had not come in
[1:40:34] the room now he didn't come through the
[1:40:35] door he was in
[1:40:37] him so the one inside him already knew
[1:40:41] what he was going to reveal he just
[1:40:43] hadn't revealed it yet so the one inside
[1:40:46] you already knows everything he knows
[1:40:49] what you have need of he knows when the
[1:40:51] time to reveal it he knows when they
[1:40:53] hear you hear he's waiting in you
[1:40:54] brother Bob for somebody to bring you in
[1:40:56] that word so he can reveal it to you so
[1:40:59] brother man said I have made a horrible
[1:41:01] mistake but he came in the room and
[1:41:03] straight he was going on Old notes and
[1:41:04] things youall know so let me tell you
[1:41:06] something I ain't read it yet but I will
[1:41:08] in a few minutes Ephesians 1: 15 is the
[1:41:11] only place you can stand it's your
[1:41:13] Prophet not Stephen that's right the
[1:41:15] only place you can stand and not be
[1:41:17] deceived in this hour and that's the
[1:41:20] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:41:23] that's the only place you can stand now
[1:41:26] I believe personally those seals was
[1:41:28] brother bram's adoption that's what I
[1:41:30] believe he wasn't adop there he was
[1:41:33] standing there just like Paul faith of
[1:41:34] fathers absolutely don't I hate to say
[1:41:37] this especially people see they already
[1:41:38] think I'm
[1:41:39] crazy I'm not saying brother Brandon was
[1:41:41] deceived or don't take it that way it
[1:41:44] hadn't open to
[1:41:46] him and why wouldn't that Holy Ghost
[1:41:48] sister Peggy let him wouldn't let him
[1:41:52] preach that wrong no you know why it
[1:41:55] wasn't in the
[1:41:56] book it's got to be in the book that's
[1:41:59] why you can't add or take away not in

[1:46:54] here and when he's preaching Christ the
[1:46:57] mystery I'm going to hurry cuz I'm going
[1:46:59] to cut a lot of it out and I'm just save
[1:47:01] time when he's preaching Christ the
[1:47:04] mystery we all understand and know he's
[1:47:07] preaching the seventh seal yes is he's
[1:47:09] preaching the third pull amen that's
[1:47:12] what he's preaching amen the third pull
[1:47:14] is the Finish it's over amen it comes a
[1:47:19] place the third pool it's to the totally
[1:47:21] lost it's to the toally lost but it's
[1:47:23] for the
[1:47:24] bride it's to the totally lost so it was
[1:47:27] over brother Brandon was preaching he
[1:47:29] based it on the entire Bible and he said
[1:47:31] you'll see this morning why I've said
[1:47:33] what I've said all the years of the time
[1:47:36] all my Ministry it's the third pull amen
[1:47:40] it's the seventh seal Amen in other
[1:47:42] words God had what incarnated himself in
[1:47:46] that Prophet when he started to read the
[1:47:49] message read spoken words Original Seed
[1:47:51] read Christ the mystery you want to get
[1:47:53] some I mean it'll help you too you
[1:47:56] better have some time cuz they're long
[1:47:57] but they're good live in them live in

[1:48:07] here what's happened see God had changed
[1:48:10] this one I'm not saying brother R is

[1:49:23] beginning of this message he said I'm
[1:49:24] not even going to look at the clock I'm
[1:49:27] not going to notice the clock he's he's
[1:49:28] talking about what what had happened in
[1:49:30] his ministry how this would happened but
[1:49:32] he immediately went to the scriptures
[1:49:33] there of of Jesus on the road to mess
[1:49:36] you know what it was they didn't know
[1:49:38] who he was there you go he went right
[1:49:41] here in the beginning not Colossians one
[1:49:43] he went first on the scripture the road
[1:49:45] the mass why he was telling the people
[1:49:47] you don't know who's here you don't know
[1:49:50] what's among you
[1:49:52] God had changed his form he changed his
[1:49:55] language you know what had happened he
[1:49:57] said by the washing of the water of the
[1:49:59] word you never did do it if you won't
[1:50:01] stand in the water and be washed you're
[1:50:03] just as filthy as Eve ever was spotted
[1:50:05] as Eve ever was you know what else he
[1:50:06] said I said it while ago you go go back
[1:50:09] and be born just like you should have
[1:50:10] been born at the beginning what did he
[1:50:12] say brother collie he said I ain't no
[1:50:14] longer the son of Charles and Ella
[1:50:16] Brandon now he wasn't denying who he was
[1:50:19] what was he doing he telling you he
[1:50:21] would been birthed back
[1:50:23] you know where he was at sister Joanna
[1:50:25] you know this you heard it you know
[1:50:26] where he was at he was standing just
[1:50:28] like he' never left the Garden of Eden
[1:50:30] he was standing right there brother
[1:50:31] colie like he never left the Garden of
[1:50:32] Eden that's where you and I are birth to
[1:50:35] we got to be birthed there by Revelation
[1:50:37] before we go
[1:50:38] there you have to say it that's my point
[1:50:41] to you young people you have to say it
[1:50:44] you have to say your you have to say
[1:50:46] your salvation the word of faith you
[1:50:47] have to speak it you'll have to speak
[1:50:49] the same thing down here Jesus said
[1:50:52] raise it brother Brandon said sitting
[1:50:55] there thinking on Mark see that's what
[1:50:56] happens my mind goes so many places Mark
[1:50:59] 11 Mark 11 he said I sitting there
[1:51:01] thinking on that here's another reason
[1:51:03] God won't change his mind about his word
[1:51:04] your word if it's word God's word don't
[1:51:07] matter whose mouth it comes out of if
[1:51:08] it's God speaking is
[1:51:10] Goden listen here brother BR sitting
[1:51:12] there brother Ryan he said think about
[1:51:14] Mark 11 he said why am i t some
[1:51:17] squirrels well speaking
[1:51:20] Prophet how many you want I want
[1:51:24] three what'd he do all of a sudden out
[1:51:28] where there was no squirrel where
[1:51:30] there's nothing there appeared a
[1:51:31] beautiful squirrel brother what'd he do
[1:51:33] he shot the squirrel what did he do
[1:51:36] though he went and got the squirrel said
[1:51:38] I'm going
[1:51:39] home now did he not but what' God do God
[1:51:44] said wait a minute Prophet you said
[1:51:47] three God don't change his
[1:51:50] mind he had to get three because why God
[1:51:53] said three all right so you so this when
[1:51:57] you speak it expect it cuz we got to
[1:52:01] speak it but it's got to be revealed
[1:52:02] first God first does it then he reveals
[1:52:05] it then he makes it manifest see he's
[1:52:07] done it people all not knowing this but
[1:52:09] if you'll turn and look at the clock he
[1:52:11] wasn't look at it but he looked at it
[1:52:13] it's on the dot two o'clock we've heard
[1:52:15] this for 50 years but all of a sudden

[1:52:27] hemisphere brother
[1:52:29] collie not knowing this it's on the dot
[1:52:32] 2
[1:52:33] o00 the end of the second pool wait a
[1:52:36] minute Prophet you preached the
[1:52:39] third not knowing this he didn't know it
[1:52:44] but God knew it God know it in the
[1:52:48] second pool the third pool is at hand
[1:52:52] right now Jesus's second pull what it do

[1:53:49] will come to pass behold I send you
[1:53:50] Elijah the prophet he'll turn the heart
[1:53:52] of the children back to the faith of the

[1:54:44] know who does it in the day that I do
[1:54:46] this sayth the Lord and ain't you and I
[1:54:48] doing it we've already got in the mess
[1:54:51] but he's here to what breaking out the
[1:54:53] mess we came in so I ain't worried about
[1:54:55] it I'm going to let him do it all right
[1:54:58] oh my what the anointed man now the
[1:55:00] anointed people oh my to bring back the
[1:55:02] anointed bride and bridegroom anointed
[1:55:05] by what right accepting what Eve turned

[1:55:11] did it produce you say well we can't he
[1:55:13] was born different he was come on buddy
[1:55:17] but this new birth is not different this
[1:55:20] new birth I'm talking about it's the
[1:55:21] word of God because see people say oh
[1:55:24] you're trying to get somewhere you can't
[1:55:25] get to you can't but he brings you there
[1:55:28] it's the washing of the water of the
[1:55:30] word brings you to the same place he was
[1:55:32] at cuz God only has one kind of son and
[1:55:35] every Son's after that kind don't now
[1:55:38] listen e that first Eve brother she fell
[1:55:41] on Hebrews 138 amen she fell on Jesus
[1:55:43] Christ the same yest stand forever so
[1:55:45] don't make me another
[1:55:46] person don't make me something else
[1:55:49] don't make yourself something else cuz
[1:55:51] you're following the same she did that's
[1:55:53] right you're saying the new birth
[1:55:55] different don't get quiet on me cuz it's
[1:55:59] not CU that's what brother Braham taught
[1:56:01] us you're back to where you should have
[1:56:03] been if You' have came in the right way
[1:56:05] in the beginning sir if you have came
[1:56:06] right in the beginning would you have
[1:56:08] ever died if sin hadn't got in turns you
[1:56:11] and I wouldn't be this old sin would
[1:56:13] have never got in so then if the word
[1:56:15] has come back to birth us back to that
[1:56:18] isn't any difference than what was in
[1:56:20] the beginning I thought he was reserved
[1:56:21] in for you I thought it was
[1:56:23] Incorruptible I thought it was undefiled
[1:56:26] that's right brother Michael that's the
[1:56:28] truth so don't don't deny it don't be
[1:56:31] afraid of it that's what God has sent it
[1:56:34] to you for that's the truth except to
[1:56:38] what anointed by what except what Eve
[1:56:39] turned down in Adam coming back with the
[1:56:41] anointing of the word because he said my
[1:56:43] word is his see the anointed word eve
[1:56:45] turned down he comes back and we
[1:56:49] accept
[1:56:50] s other place here i' got it wrote down
[1:56:53] what's he
[1:56:55] do here's the here it is he said he
[1:56:57] promised the word would be here and here
[1:56:59] it is so what happened there stay with
[1:57:01] me now I'm gonna hit these notes here
[1:57:03] I've got all this but I ain't gonna get
[1:57:04] to it look what he says a Malachi four
[1:57:07] child is a fanatical child
[1:57:10] amen come on bu all right they're a
[1:57:13] fanatical child people says you're
[1:57:16] you're a fanatic Wilson that's what I
[1:57:20] amen I believe in the
[1:57:22] Supernatural I believe in a God that can
[1:57:24] change a heart I believe in a God that
[1:57:26] can change a man or One A boy I believe
[1:57:28] in a God that can reveal his word all
[1:57:31] right so I believe he has to birth us
[1:57:33] back I'll get to it here in a minute I
[1:57:34] promise you amen believes things are
[1:57:37] impossible it believes they'll never die
[1:57:40] amen think about it now see the second
[1:57:43] pull of Jesus was prophecy turn it down
[1:57:46] and I'll raise it so there's the seed
[1:57:49] there's the seed brother Brandon brought
[1:57:50] us well God said wait a minute Propet
[1:57:52] second pull let's put that Gene let's
[1:57:54] put that seed in them they've got to
[1:57:56] have that seed to be birthed back just
[1:57:58] like you was birth that's what it was
[1:58:00] brother and sister whether we want to
[1:58:01] believe it or not
[1:58:02] see the second pull so I you young
[1:58:05] people when I say second pull what that
[1:58:08] is that's prophecy that's the word so if
[1:58:11] I tell brother Michael brother Michael
[1:58:13] I'll be at your house tomorrow I'm
[1:58:16] speaking of something that happen when I
[1:58:18] show up tomorrow there is the
[1:58:19] manifestation of it that's that's what
[1:58:21] Jesus said tear this Temple down in 3
[1:58:23] days I'll raise it what did he do he
[1:58:26] expressed what he said it went back for
[1:58:28] him so I see that so when you read where
[1:58:31] the third pull goes back for it there it
[1:58:33] does what's it do it goes back to the
[1:58:35] prophecy the word the seed that you've
[1:58:37] received it expresses it because you
[1:58:38] can't express it only God can do it all
[1:58:41] right is that I hope that makes sense I
[1:58:43] want to make it so simple
[1:58:45] you it is yes cuz it's revealed in
[1:58:48] simplicity so everybody wants to be
[1:58:50] go forget that stuff just get the word
[1:58:53] you know that's what it's all about we
[1:58:55] don't need that second pull all right no
[1:58:58] man spoke like him ain't never been a
[1:59:01] man speak like that man TI it down all
[1:59:04] rais it now there have been a lot of
[1:59:06] people raised from the
[1:59:08] dead even the Old Testament they throw
[1:59:11] the bones on the dead person on the
[1:59:13] bones of el they come back alive lot of
[1:59:16] things a lot of other people raised De
[1:59:17] Jesus raised a lot of people from the
[1:59:18] dead but nobody ever raised thems from
[1:59:21] the dead
[1:59:22] all right so now here was a man said I
[1:59:25] will die but I don't need I don't need
[1:59:27] Mama to come by and pray for me I don't
[1:59:29] need nobody no priest or my he here was
[1:59:32] a man said I will die I'll lay my life
[1:59:35] down and I'll raise it up myself all
[1:59:37] right so no man spoke like that man and
[1:59:39] let me tell you something else brothers
[1:59:41] and sisters that's who lives in you
[1:59:43] today the very glory of God that us rise
[1:59:46] and shine upon thee that's what lives in
[1:59:49] you today think about it now greater is
[1:59:52] he that's in you than he that's in the
[1:59:53] world what are we afraid of Hallelujah I
[1:59:56] mean I tell you what I will raise no man
[1:59:59] spoke like him then here come a man
[2:00:02] called William
[2:00:04] brandom then old man spoke like that man
[2:00:08] here he was saying things you can go
[2:00:11] back and be born just like you should
[2:00:13] have been born in the beginning what do
[2:00:15] you
[2:00:16] mean I come here across the C when
[2:00:18] you're saying I can be born right you're
[2:00:21] now then after that he starts
[2:00:25] saying you ain't the son of Charles Ella
[2:00:28] brandom you wasn't born on no certain
[2:00:31] day see he's in the very positive God's
[2:00:34] mind he had been B now he wasn't telling
[2:00:37] you something to learn he was telling
[2:00:39] you his experience through Redemption
[2:00:42] see that's what brother BR was preaching
[2:00:44] see we we have made it educational we've
[2:00:48] learned about it brother ter we can
[2:00:50] teach the new birth we just
[2:00:52] we can teach it I don't want to teach it
[2:00:55] I want you to experience it see brother
[2:00:57] Brandon was preaching us his
[2:01:00] experience and he had been birthed There
[2:01:02] Brother Gary he had been birthed back to
[2:01:04] there like he should so he was standing
[2:01:06] just like he was in the Garden of Eden
[2:01:08] that's why but he you know what he
[2:01:09] wanted to see he said I want to live to
[2:01:10] see it he wanted to see you live see you
[2:01:12] and I to get that let me find this right
[2:01:15] here get ready for that
[2:01:17] so
[2:01:20] look brother R look at his second pool
[2:01:23] prophecy that's what he started speaking
[2:01:25] that's right that second pull telling
[2:01:27] you who you were right now just because
[2:01:29] he told you that that don't make you
[2:01:31] that you got to be birthed there through
[2:01:34] the watching of the water of the word
[2:01:36] that's exactly what it all is see Paul
[2:01:40] all spoke in part I ain't got time to
[2:01:41] read those scriptures brother Brandon
[2:01:43] went into Perfection y Paul didn't go
[2:01:45] into Perfection brother Brandon went
[2:01:47] into Perfection Paul did not brother
[2:01:50] Brandon brought the full plan of
[2:01:51] Redemption Jesus Christ showed the
[2:01:53] entire Plan of Redemption went through
[2:01:55] the whole Plan of Redemption even
[2:01:56] through the change of the body he did
[2:01:58] brother Brandon went through the entire
[2:01:59] Plan of Redemption through Revelation he
[2:02:01] just didn't come to what the third stage
[2:02:03] of adoption which is the change because
[2:02:05] he couldn't where he was at just like I
[2:02:07] read he couldn't because of where he
[2:02:08] came in the scriptures that's the only
[2:02:10] reason all right so but
[2:02:14] look same seed Mary received is the same
[2:02:17] seed you're birth with amen that's right
[2:02:19] so you get the same B birth and stand
[2:02:22] the same place he stood the way you came
[2:02:25] had nothing to do with it cuz it was
[2:02:26] reserved it didn't corrupt it's still
[2:02:29] the same seed it's going to do the same
[2:02:30] thing that done if You' received in the
[2:02:32] first in the Garden of Eden brother
[2:02:33] Michael it's because you came wrong he
[2:02:35] got nothing to do with it it makes him a
[2:02:37] redeemer see it makes him everything it
[2:02:40] expresses him see everybody say brother
[2:02:42] B somebody says praise God I always was
[2:02:44] you know what they're doing they're not
[2:02:46] allowing God to express his attribute
[2:02:49] they don't realize it it sounds
[2:02:50] spiritual and they wonderful but it's
[2:02:51] not the truth God let it happen he
[2:02:54] didn't make it happen he let it happen
[2:02:56] so what he can express his attribute so
[2:02:59] what he's a redeemer you know who makes
[2:03:01] him a redeemer you and I make him a
[2:03:03] redeemer because why we come to full
[2:03:07] Redemption so there's his full
[2:03:09] expression as a redeemer expressed and
[2:03:11] you and I sister Joyce why I tell you
[2:03:13] what I'd like to throw these things
[2:03:16] sometimes they just getting the way but
[2:03:18] see what but see we we express the full
[2:03:22] Plan of Redemption oh my I got to hurry
[2:03:25] I'm sorry I got a long drive y'all don't
[2:03:28] so we're all
[2:03:30] right see brother see look here same
[2:03:34] birth stand the same place he stood
[2:03:36] brother Brandon took the place of God in
[2:03:38] marriage and divorce the fir look here
[2:03:41] the first man that had the book you know
[2:03:43] what he did he said that's a cow he said
[2:03:47] that's a horse he said that's a dog and
[2:03:50] you know what nobody's been a to change
[2:03:52] it s it's still a cat dog horse whatever
[2:03:55] it is whatever that son said that's what
[2:03:58] it was there's that Prophet up there on
[2:04:00] the mountain talking to God out there
[2:04:03] and that that Pillar of Fire going up
[2:04:04] and down people's watching what was he
[2:04:08] doing why there's no hope people sitting
[2:04:11] there being married three and four and
[2:04:12] five times and everything else all
[2:04:13] messed up what
[2:04:15] happened brother BR said there a mess
[2:04:18] here's what I believe and I ain't making
[2:04:19] a doctor out of this what do you you say
[2:04:22] Prophet what do you
[2:04:25] say what do you say prophet and what
[2:04:27] brother Rand
[2:04:29] say by the opening of The Seven Cals I
[2:04:34] can say this amen by the why see what
[2:04:37] those seals do it goes why it takes you
[2:04:40] back to the beginning if Jesus had he
[2:04:43] couldn't have done that but one
[2:04:45] scripture they come to Jesus and they
[2:04:47] about Moses and and divorce Jesus what
[2:04:49] would he say brother boy he know he'd
[2:04:51] say it wasn't so from the beginning so
[2:04:55] there was a man that was back before the
[2:04:57] beginning there he was so see what we've
[2:05:00] got we got something to it that what
[2:05:02] that God has brought you and I that's
[2:05:04] from the Garden of Eden to take us back
[2:05:06] there I got a whole goodness back in the
[2:05:08] garden you never see you're back in the
[2:05:10] garden never done it you came the same
[2:05:12] way you don't by Pastor theoy down here
[2:05:15] you bypass the word the first time but
[2:05:17] this time you don't bypass it it's being
[2:05:20] see that's what's going to change you
[2:05:21] the one inside you let me tell you what
[2:05:23] it is I'll just read the last little
[2:05:25] quote right here
[2:05:28] brother Bob was reading there a while
[2:05:30] ago well I thought I had it yeah they
[2:05:34] asked brother man what's the change he
[2:05:36] said it's the word in you he said it
[2:05:38] builds another person in the image of
[2:05:39] the person you are so it's not another
[2:05:42] person it's you it's who you are so
[2:05:46] potentially so potentially it's in here
[2:05:49] what is it the word promised from the
[2:05:51] the foundation of the world where's it
[2:05:53] at it's being formed in
[2:05:56] you this only reflects the negative that
[2:05:59] reflects the positive the word the same
[2:06:02] thing translation of the Bri be the same
[2:06:03] word same thing the word that's in you
[2:06:06] the body will materialize around that
[2:06:08] word the same thing did with Sarah this
[2:06:10] body cannot do it so it have to be
[2:06:12] changed same way to receive that son the
[2:06:14] word in you what's going to do it all
[2:06:16] right so that's why it's so important
[2:06:18] let me hurry here there stood a lamb
[2:06:19] with a book in his hand the original
[2:06:21] honor back on Earth amen back on Earth
[2:06:25] and he brought it to you and I in a
[2:06:26] prophecy seed form that you and I can

[2:09:32] anything oh listen now thank God praise
[2:09:35] God for open these seals my prayer to
[2:09:36] know these things now the real true
[2:09:39] revelation of me cazic comes into view
[2:09:41] what he was God the word and he became
[2:09:44] flesh
[2:09:46] yes he had to be no one else is immortal
[2:09:48] like him no but I see I had a father
[2:09:51] mother you did too Jesus had father and
[2:09:53] mother but this man had no father and
[2:09:55] mother Jesus had a time he started this
[2:09:58] man
[2:10:01] didn't this man could th Jesus gave his
[2:10:05] life this man couldn't because he was
[2:10:08] life
[2:10:10] amen and it's the selfs same man all the
[2:10:14] time so I can show you in the message
[2:10:17] one place brother R say that he said
[2:10:19] that was not Jesus talking to mecad
[2:10:22] or Abraham that was me that weren't
[2:10:25] Jesus it wasn't cuz Jesus hadn't been
[2:10:27] born yet but then he'll turn right
[2:10:29] around two weeks later and say brother
[2:10:31] Ryan that was Jesus can you go with me
[2:10:34] there that's what he'll say why he's a
[2:10:38] self-same person the flesh had nothing
[2:10:40] to do with it so that's what your new
[2:10:43] birth is this flesh what it used to be
[2:10:45] brother col it ain't what it used to be
[2:10:48] why it's coming to something so now let
[2:10:50] me show you this
[2:10:52] real
[2:10:59] quick me I got it printed over here I'm
[2:11:01] sorry let me get this right
[2:11:06] here this milk
[2:11:08] kesic the difference between you and
[2:11:12] him now think about this the difference
[2:11:14] between him and you as a son not your
[2:11:19] first birth right amen right brother not
[2:11:21] your first birth your first birth had
[2:11:23] nothing to do with it you came Satan's
[2:11:25] plan lost with the world but what
[2:11:28] through his act through his thoughts
[2:11:30] through his for knowledge he knew what
[2:11:32] you do and that word crossed your path
[2:11:35] you he didn't let be put this way like
[2:11:36] brother R said in the future home he
[2:11:38] didn't wait till you got down here to
[2:11:40] see what you choose he chose you before
[2:11:42] the foundation of the world but he
[2:11:44] didn't just choose you because he's
[2:11:45] going to make brother Michael serve him
[2:11:47] he knew brother Michael would serve him
[2:11:49] said he knew I'd love him he knew I'd
[2:11:52] love him he knew I'd serve him he listen
[2:11:54] I believe in free moral agency yes sir
[2:11:56] you're looking at one man believes in
[2:11:58] free moral agency God cuz why in other
[2:12:00] words if not God is not a
[2:12:03] redeemer there no way he's a respector
[2:12:05] person listen he he see you say see he
[2:12:10] was at the beginning the word and a
[2:12:13] morphe body amen he came and lived in
[2:12:17] that person that's who meaz make and the
[2:12:19] person of meaz later you heard no more
[2:12:22] of me cazic because he became Jesus
[2:12:25] Christ selfsame person all the time just
[2:12:29] changing his form so don't tell me when
[2:12:31] he changes his form to me I'm another
[2:12:34] person don't tell me when Ryan that that
[2:12:36] word becomes incarnate brother Ryan he's
[2:12:38] another person he may look like the same
[2:12:40] little brother Ryan that comes up here
[2:12:42] and real softspoken he don't change a
[2:12:45] bit but it's a selfs same person all the
[2:12:48] time that's what that birth does because
[2:12:51] b c was the priest but he became Jesus
[2:12:54] Christ you bypass that because in that
[2:12:57] form he know see you bypass that but as
[2:13:00] a sign down here you don't bypass it all
[2:13:03] right I promise I'm stopping two things
[2:13:05] when I'm going to stop cuz I believe the
[2:13:07] fivefold ministry is for the perfecting
[2:13:09] of the Saints what I'm talking about is
[2:13:11] perfection that's the Garden of Eden the
[2:13:13] only way to get there is through the
[2:13:14] fivefold ministry for the perfecting
[2:13:16] where you're not tossed to and fro
[2:13:18] everywh in the doctor as a child you're
[2:13:21] unskillful as a child I'm not talking
[2:13:23] about an age I'm talking about as a
[2:13:24] newborn baby Christ you got to be taught
[2:13:26] and brought up because the five-fold
[2:13:27] ministry is not taught in this day
[2:13:29] brought in this day for repentance don't
[2:13:32] misunderstand me it brings you it's for
[2:13:35] Perfection we've come for Perfection

[2:22:06] that what happened this weekend with the
[2:22:08] storms and the um I mean where he lived
[2:22:11] up there the bridges got wiped out
[2:22:13] people got wiped out uh if you saw on
[2:22:16] the news where they were extracting
[2:22:18] those people off of the top of that
[2:22:21] hospital that was only where they were
[2:22:23] Landing was right in front of his
[2:22:25] daddy's house right down below it if
[2:22:27] you've ever been there it's right where
[2:22:28] the old track used to be that was
[2:22:31] close and everything in the world Steven
[2:22:34] said he said everything in the world was
[2:22:36] going wrong to get down
[2:22:40] here had some trees fall
[2:22:42] overs a fence got
[2:22:46] cows let me tell you how God works
[2:22:50] he was almost ready to call me and say
[2:22:53] he wasn't
[2:22:54] coming and then the devil wasn't
[2:22:57] finished he goes down to the
[2:23:00] barn to crank his
[2:23:02] tractor he has a little friend there to
[2:23:04] help him and they can't get the tractor
[2:23:07] started so Steven's going to get a go
[2:23:09] and get a
[2:23:11] battery walking back home he said Lord
[2:23:13] if you don't want me to
[2:23:17] go he said
[2:23:20] don't start that
[2:23:22] tractor pretty much if you don't want me
[2:23:25] to
[2:23:26] go all this has happened all this is
[2:23:29] going on they went down there and tried
[2:23:30] him and his friend tried to crank that
[2:23:33] tractor he said when he got
[2:23:35] home to do all that he said he turned
[2:23:38] around and looked and there was a man
[2:23:40] down in the barn doing
[2:23:44] this got
[2:23:51] we don't believe in a supernatural
[2:23:53] you've missed it
[2:23:54] somewhere this was appointed of
[2:23:57] God this was a load I'm going to tell
[2:23:59] you something and this is no um a
[2:24:02] disrespect to to Steven we call each
[2:24:04] other by the first we we're family we a
[2:24:07] brother we're family I'm sorry but uh
[2:24:10] you just heard
[2:24:13] today you just heard for those of you
[2:24:15] that don't know my dad and never heard
[2:24:17] him
[2:24:18] preach you just heard my dad for the
[2:24:20] last 50
[2:24:23] years all in one sermon but it was in a
[2:24:27] different way that he brought it that
[2:24:29] you can understand it
[2:24:31] now and his dad same way it's what you
[2:24:34] heard and let me tell you something else
[2:24:37] this is the precursor to what you're
[2:24:38] going to hear when we get started on
[2:24:41] Malachi 4 cuz we're right at the last
[2:24:43] Church age we right at the last time I
[2:24:45] told you we're going to talk about
[2:24:46] brother br's Ministry well right there
[2:24:48] he told you the whole thing right there
[2:24:50] that was powerful if you didn't
[2:24:53] understand it then then you got to pray
[2:24:54] to God God's the only one who can help
[2:24:57] you understand it but it was a truth and
[2:25:00] that was the most positive sermon I've
[2:25:02] ever heard him preach and he was very
[2:25:05] comfortable he wasn't at first but he
[2:25:06] got comfortable but we appreciate
[2:25:08] brother Steven he has absolutely got a
[2:25:10] Ministry that that and I'll promise you
[2:25:13] he couldn't preach that at other
[2:25:16] places for those of you that know he can
[2:25:18] no he can pre he can only preach that
[2:25:20] here that we can understand it and at
[2:25:21] his church right that's why that's why
[2:25:24] our ministers Don't Preach a whole lot
[2:25:27] and I ain't saying nothing that's just
[2:25:29] I'm just giving God all the all the
[2:25:31] glory for it for the foundation we have
[2:25:33] with brother Dale and brother Richard
[2:25:35] Wilson all these years being together
[2:25:37] and being feeding off each other and
[2:25:39] feeding off the word of God and and I
[2:25:41] feel
[2:25:43] proud that that Steven didn't get his
[2:25:45] tongue ripped out of his out of his
[2:25:48] mouth Satan was trying to stop him I was
[2:25:51] thinking that when I sitting right that
[2:25:53] all come back to my memory when you were
[2:25:54] sitting I thought man he shouldn't even
[2:25:56] be up here talking his tongue was gone
[2:26:00] but the doctors put it back together
[2:26:03] and I think that was God's tongue that
[2:26:05] talked to us today I don't think that
[2:26:07] was D Wilson so let's give our brother a
[2:26:10] good
[2:26:11] hand listen we're in the closing of time
[2:26:15] everything that's happening is not
[2:26:17] happening it's happening for a purpose
[2:26:21] every
[2:26:22] step is happening for a purpose
[2:26:24] everything everything that's going on
[2:26:26] all the preachers that we have come in
[2:26:28] all the ministry that's been that's been
[2:26:30] ministered here and all the ministers
[2:26:32] that go out and Minister other places
[2:26:33] it's all coming down as brother Steven
[2:26:36] said is coming down to we got to all be
[2:26:39] right on they can't be 15 different
[2:26:43] doctrines come on no you said oh you got
[2:26:47] your way and you got my way even brother
[2:26:48] Ram said well he's coming on a horse or
[2:26:50] or or or a cloud he said it don't matter
[2:26:52] but that was with
[2:26:54] him that was with him he was talking to
[2:26:57] denominational people ain't talking to
[2:26:59] denominational people now we got to get
[2:27:02] this thing down right and you know what
[2:27:05] I don't know if y'all ever heard this
[2:27:06] before but God don't make a
[2:27:08] mistake God never I say it every service
[2:27:10] God never changes his mind he's always
[2:27:13] right he puts people in when he wants to
[2:27:16] put them in he takes them out where he
[2:27:17] wants to take them out sir cuz God is is
[2:27:20] in control of this whole thing and I
[2:27:22] appreciate brother Steven I appreciate

[2:27:40] t-shirt he forgot his clothes so he had
[2:27:42] to go buy he had to go buy that suit
[2:27:44] last night but uh see the devil he just
[2:27:47] tries to he's a trip uper he just tries
[2:27:49] to make thing go Haywire but guess
[2:27:52] what I think we heard from God today

[2:27:57] what he said you know he said God if I'm
[2:27:59] not supposed to go don't let that

[2:33:11] great How
[2:33:14] Great Is Our
[2:33:17] God you know we were we were up at the
[2:33:20] men's meeting a couple weeks ago and we
[2:33:22] need to pray for the sisters coming back
[2:33:23] today they should be getting ready to
[2:33:24] get on an airplane here pretty quick and
[2:33:27] get back home and uh um but we were at a
[2:33:30] men's
[2:33:31] meeting and
[2:33:33] um we were sitting around talking about
[2:33:35] something and then later on the minister
[2:33:38] he read acts
[2:33:40] 238 now how many times have we read acts
[2:33:44] 238 a lot a lot of times right yes amen
[2:33:49] and one day
[2:33:50] it was revealed to you what that
[2:33:53] said
[2:33:56] amen billions of people read acts 238
[2:34:00] and and don't even they don't even
[2:34:01] consider it old brother Tatum he told us
[2:34:04] one time when he was a Baptist you know
[2:34:06] they believed in Father Son and Holy
[2:34:07] Ghost baptism which is false we know
[2:34:09] that but brother Tatum he said I'd read
[2:34:11] that where John you know where in
[2:34:13] Matthew where Jesus said that he said
[2:34:14] when I get to Acts 2 he said I just flip
[2:34:17] right through the
[2:34:18] pages kind of skip over it well listen
[2:34:20] you can't skip over the word of God you
[2:34:23] might can but he's going to bring you
[2:34:25] back to it every time and I sat there
[2:34:26] and almost weeped and acts 238 if you
[2:34:30] really see that and you read it that God
[2:34:33] revealed that to
[2:34:34] you and he didn't reveal it to the whole
[2:34:38] world he only revealed that to you
[2:34:40] brother Ryan cuz you won't see it unless
[2:34:42] you do see it because of the 8 billion
[2:34:45] people in this world probably seven or
[2:34:47] eight Bill almost 8 billion people they
[2:34:49] baptize the name Father Son and Holy
[2:34:51] Ghost that's the common way to do it
[2:34:53] that's the most popular way to do it but
[2:34:55] it ain't the right way to do
[2:34:57] it you got to take on a name if you
[2:35:00] didn't realize your name
[2:35:02] today I adure you in the name of the
[2:35:04] Lord find your name in that
[2:35:06] book cuz remember that book is in the
[2:35:09] hand of the
[2:35:10] lamb and if you're not of the Lamb
[2:35:13] you're not in that
[2:35:14] book you're in that book of life that's
[2:35:16] going to be judged at the end of time
[2:35:21] but not not the
[2:35:23] bride not the Lamb's Book not that
[2:35:26] Eternal part that genesis: 126 when he
[2:35:28] said that that was all of us that was
[2:35:30] all of his children he's ever going to
[2:35:32] have that's at Genesis 126 man and that
[2:35:34] was what was in that book that's really
[2:35:36] what that book was was God spoke and
[2:35:38] said I'm going to have a group of people
[2:35:40] that's going to be my
[2:35:42] children and they couldn't fulfill it so
[2:35:44] he took all that back and hold on held
[2:35:46] on to it until Jesus came with the book
[2:35:49] inside of of him it's a
[2:35:51] secret it's a secret catching
[2:35:54] away like brother Steven said you know
[2:35:56] you look at brother Ryan and you look
[2:35:57] all people grow they just that's just
[2:35:59] brother Ryan no that's a son and
