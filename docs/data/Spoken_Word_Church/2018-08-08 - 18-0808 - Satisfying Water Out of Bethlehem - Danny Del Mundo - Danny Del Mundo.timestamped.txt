[3:45] and we certainly appreciate for the Sun
[3:51] was consistent confidence amen and every
[3:56] time there's opportunity he gives me the
[4:00] privilege to stand behind the podium and
[4:03] you know it's not that easy you know
[4:05] because the bottom said the pastors are
[4:08] the most suspicious people amen and so
[4:15] we have great respect for him and we
[4:19] also appreciate what you're doing the
[4:22] support you're doing for the mission
[4:24] works and we're always praying for you
[4:27] and of course my precious brother my
[4:31] friend but there by the way
[4:35] amen we're looking forward for his next
[4:37] visit to the Philippines amen
[4:40] along with sister Jude Lord willing amen
[4:44] so go straight to the reading of the
[4:47] word and probably in between we also
[4:49] would like to share you some of the
[4:51] things that are going on in the mission
[4:53] field amen
[4:55] so let's read in 2nd samuel chapter 23
[4:58] 14 to 17 I believe this is very much
[5:06] familiar with each and every one where
[5:10] the word is always familiar with the
[5:11] bride for the bride amen
[5:13] and we had nothing to preach except the
[5:16] word of the hour
[5:17] Amen so turn your Bibles with me on 2nd
[5:22] Samuel chapter 23 we read from verse 14
[5:30] it says and David longed and said oh
[5:35] that one would give me drink of the
[5:38] water of the well of Bethlehem which is
[5:41] by the gate and the three mighty men
[5:44] break
[5:45] through the host of the Philistines and
[5:47] drew water out of the well of Bethlehem
[5:49] that was by the gate and took it and
[5:53] brought it to David nevertheless he
[5:56] would not drink there off
[5:57] but poured it out and to the Lord and he
[6:01] said be it far from me O Lord that I
[6:04] should do this is not this the blood of
[6:06] the men that went in jeopardy of their
[6:08] lives
[6:09] therefore he would not drink it these
[6:12] things did these three mighty men
[6:16] let's pray dear Heavenly Father we thank
[6:18] you we give you all the glory and the
[6:21] honor and Lord you just speak once again
[6:24] through these lips of your little
[6:27] servant and made this be a little
[6:30] encouragement Lord for each and every
[6:32] one and thank you for your blood that
[6:35] continuously giving us wide access for
[6:40] your revealed word amen we thank you in
[6:43] Jesus Christ's name Amen praise the lord
[6:46] god bless you you may be seated
[6:48] amen so before I proceed on to the the
[6:55] preaching of the word we just want to
[6:59] acquaint you once again with the things
[7:02] that the Lord is doing of course in the
[7:04] Philippines the work of the Lord is
[7:08] still widely doing good by God's grace
[7:15] and with that more than 7,100 Islands
[7:22] Amen is in itself a mission field and
[7:26] also outside the Philippines we're doing
[7:29] a lot of mission works and before I been
[7:35] active in the Muslim country of
[7:37] Indonesia but things are now doing good
[7:40] and the ministers there are doing their
[7:43] own portion in in missions and that's
[7:48] that's our main purpose you know Bella
[7:50] Branham said get the natives save and
[7:52] let the native preach to some people and
[7:54] so Indonesia is for the Indonesian
[7:58] but we just want to try to do a little
[8:02] encouragement to the ministry and when I
[8:04] was there starting in 2003 and the first
[8:10] time I was there and then we did some
[8:14] exposition in starting in 2004 and just
[8:20] recently last February I was there and
[8:22] they requested that we got there all the
[8:26] local ministers in Indonesia and I was
[8:30] really I was really surprised because
[8:32] more than 30 ministers have been
[8:35] gathered in that three days of meetings
[8:43] along with some other local assembly
[8:46] fellowships and so before I was going to
[8:52] Indonesia at least two or three times a
[8:54] year but now I do it
[8:56] once a year because Myanmar has opened
[8:59] widely and in my previous trip there I
[9:03] was able to baptize another pastor and a
[9:07] portion of his congregation and if you
[9:10] remember when I was here two or three
[9:15] years ago
[9:17] there's a bishop in the denomination who
[9:21] who 30 churches under his ministry I
[9:28] brought my wife there and she was able
[9:31] to to see there's a Bible School in the
[9:34] church compound and he showed me the map
[9:37] where there are 30 stars and he said
[9:40] these stars represent the 30 churches
[9:41] that the Lord has given me for my 20
[9:45] years of ministry and last November last
[9:49] year we gathered all this ministry
[9:57] ministers three from each church one
[10:01] pastor the assistant pastor and at least
[10:04] one worker plus the local ministers
[10:08] and we were able to gather by God's
[10:11] grace more than a hundred ministers
[10:12] under him
[10:13] of course 30 churches and they are they
[10:18] are in in deep desire to know more about
[10:22] this message and that's Bishop his name
[10:25] is pastor Tom boy he said anytime you
[10:27] come over here but the Danny my my my
[10:32] pulpit my church is open to you and in
[10:36] fact at that time I was about to baptize
[10:40] six individuals but we have no place and
[10:45] we just we just discuss about baptism
[10:47] and he said if you have no place to to
[10:51] baptize my baptismal pool here is open
[10:53] and you can you can use my baptismal
[10:56] pool and my wife was there and I was
[11:00] surprised when I asked him because I
[11:02] have already shared with them about the
[11:04] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:06] Christ because we all we already had two
[11:08] meetings there and I was able to present
[11:13] the message of restoration you know and
[11:16] when you touch on the message of
[11:17] restoration of course initially the
[11:21] initial move of the restoration you
[11:25] touched on the baptism in the name of
[11:26] the Lord Jesus Christ and they have
[11:28] heard it already the students had heard
[11:30] it and I asked him well pastor you know
[11:32] I have you have heard what I what I
[11:34] taught about baptism i baptize in the
[11:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so if
[11:42] and he said if you baptize I will let my
[11:45] students go down and they will they will
[11:47] they will assist you in baptism
[11:50] so your students will hear that the
[11:54] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:55] Christ he said I have no problem with
[11:58] that if it is it if it is scriptural
[12:00] then I will just accept it so last time
[12:05] I was there he said please pray for me
[12:09] because the organization is already
[12:12] pressuring me and because you know I
[12:14] have accepted a minister from the
[12:17] Philippines that does not belong to our
[12:20] community
[12:21] you know and he was being questioned but
[12:24] he said if they couldn't continue on
[12:26] questioning me then that's the reason
[12:28] for me to go out of the organization so
[12:31] just please pray for that brother he
[12:33] ceases he's kinda old and we were
[12:38] looking for but there are actually three
[12:41] pastors under him who are directly
[12:44] communicating with me and directly
[12:46] inviting me to minister to their
[12:49] congregation but I'm still praying for
[12:52] that because I I'm thinking if I go
[12:56] directly to his outreaches it will not
[12:59] do good to him and you know he would
[13:02] think that we are proselyting his guru
[13:04] no so so I said you just wait and let's
[13:07] see what what the bishop will will do in
[13:11] the next meetings so I have not yet
[13:14] presented the prophet but I have already
[13:18] shared the five comings of Elijah and of
[13:21] course it's still Elijah there the
[13:23] fourth one so so by God's grace we were
[13:27] able to share them the urgency and the
[13:30] necessity of having the prophet in the
[13:32] last day so we're praying that next time
[13:36] if we if I got there and I'm praying to
[13:39] be there in October so we will see even
[13:45] because we have already discussed the
[13:48] first four seals and the peep and the
[13:50] six so when you I said it's not yet
[13:54] because it's seven seals you know in the
[13:57] seventh seal there's half-hour silence
[13:59] and so that will be next so you cannot
[14:05] share the 17 without sharing the seven
[14:07] star seven star messenger so so we just
[14:11] follow the leading of the Lord and then
[14:14] the the recent development also in Japan
[14:17] right now we are doing good by God's
[14:22] grace and we have put together our
[14:25] efforts last last January of this year
[14:29] brother Craig birth Timothy prove it and
[14:33] also George winters in
[14:35] in the church we agreed when I was here
[14:39] last year we agreed to to gather all the
[14:42] Japanese believers in one place and
[14:45] they're actually working in Gifu where
[14:47] there's pew believers there and it's too
[14:50] far so we agreed to hold it in Tokyo
[14:56] area where I where I operate for the
[14:59] past few years and as I was telling with
[15:04] brother Samuel there's a couple who used
[15:06] to be missionaries in the organization
[15:10] and now they have embraced the message
[15:12] they have accepted the Prophet and he
[15:15] said he is really the Prophet and now
[15:17] they are very instrumental in bringing
[15:20] in more Japanese people actually the
[15:24] previous Japanese believers I found out
[15:28] that most of them are Chinese that moved
[15:31] into Japan but when my wife and I were
[15:36] there visiting a widow and a daughter
[15:39] which we were staying in their home so I
[15:42] have to bring sister Isabella with me
[15:44] and at that time the Lord gave me two
[15:47] souls a mother and his son and then this
[15:51] son married that young young the
[15:54] daughter of that Widow and they got
[15:56] married and they and still now they are
[15:59] holding on to this message so and
[16:02] they're pure Japanese so now we are
[16:07] praying that we are going to to find a
[16:10] place to gather them because every time
[16:12] we hold meetings we just rent function
[16:14] holes so by God Lord willing we will be
[16:21] able to make it there once again and as
[16:27] we commit ourselves you know because but
[16:33] the Vanna made mention about Japan and
[16:35] he was not able to do to get there amen
[16:39] so we just keep everything in the into
[16:41] the hand of the Lord and we just
[16:43] committed and we believe that the Lord
[16:45] amen what he is supposed to do
[16:48] ayman so spray for us and so we just
[16:53] want to talk about the simple thought
[16:56] this evening about the satisfying water
[17:00] out of Bethlehem amen
[17:03] so now in this scripture that we have
[17:08] read we see that David verse 15 said
[17:16] David longed and said oh that one would
[17:20] give me drink of the water of the well
[17:22] of Bethlehem which is by the gate so it
[17:25] was just a longing it was just a wish
[17:29] because David realized that Bethlehem at
[17:34] that time was not under his control it
[17:40] was under the control of the Philistines
[17:43] and they say it says in verse 14 that
[17:48] David was then hold and the garrison of
[17:51] the Philistines was then in Bethlehem so
[17:54] they had they had full control and so in
[17:58] reality David could just wish even and
[18:03] he was not expecting to actually drink
[18:06] out of that water because the reality is
[18:09] its although it's not it's not
[18:13] impossible because the three mighty men
[18:16] were able to cut through and they were
[18:18] able to get water and in fact they were
[18:20] able to bring it to David amen and David
[18:27] in fact did not did not bring it because
[18:29] he said I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to
[18:32] to drink this kind of water but not just
[18:36] literally the water but the act of these
[18:39] three mighty men putting themselves
[18:42] putting their lives at risk is something
[18:45] a sacrifice amen
[18:47] that that David could not could not take
[18:50] aim and I don't deserve such kind of
[18:53] service amen and and so we could
[18:55] understand why brother Branham said you
[18:57] know that was that was Christ in David
[19:00] amen because
[19:02] there's something you know so in in in
[19:06] some messages but random describe
[19:08] Bethlehem
[19:10] we know that Bethlehem means it's it's
[19:13] the house of God spread right it's the
[19:16] house of God spread but also in the same
[19:19] message in paragraph 119 brother Branham
[19:22] said but Bethlehem is the water seat of
[19:25] the province - so it's not just a place
[19:29] of the house of God's bread but
[19:33] literally it is also a place for a
[19:37] special water but Bethlehem is the water
[19:40] seat of the province - there was no
[19:43] water like Bethlehem had David used to
[19:46] think when I take my ship and start out
[19:49] of mourning and go by that old well and
[19:52] drink oh how cool and how sweet and how
[19:54] it quenches the thirst amen and now his
[19:58] trots going yet anointed oh if only I
[20:02] had a drink of water and he screamed out
[20:06] in his despair
[20:07] or if someone would bring me a drink
[20:09] again from that old well yonder at
[20:11] Bethlehem after dreaming up all his
[20:14] childhood days and the victories and see
[20:16] him in the place where his setting her
[20:19] between the friars his scream oh if
[20:22] someone could bring me water from
[20:24] Bethlehem so it was a deep longing and
[20:28] you know sometimes it happens to us you
[20:31] know we're longing for something but we
[20:33] know it won't be possible it won't be it
[20:36] won't be available amen and we could we
[20:40] could only wish we could only think and
[20:41] that was the situation up David amen and
[20:46] Berman said you know David was dreaming
[20:49] of all his childhood days and perhaps
[20:51] you know that well has a lot of thing
[20:56] for David to remember you know and maybe
[20:59] he was when he wrote that song as the
[21:02] deer hunted for water you know he he
[21:05] might have taken the inspiration in that
[21:08] in that well you know
[21:11] maybe while while pastoring his his
[21:14] sheep you know here comes the blood the
[21:16] bleeding deer and you know but one said
[21:18] when when the deer is wounded when he
[21:20] went when the deer is fighting for its
[21:23] life the only thing that he could he
[21:25] could do is to run and he will he will
[21:28] not stop running until he find water
[21:30] amen and so that's is that some kind of
[21:36] an inspiration well David was able to
[21:38] write that song as the deer panteth
[21:40] poured water in it and so without the
[21:44] knowledge of David without the knowledge
[21:46] of David we come to realize that these
[21:49] three mighty warriors they said three of
[21:52] his mighty warriors pulled their swords
[21:55] sleep upon the cam and cut their way 25
[21:58] miles David in there going no doubt
[22:02] wondered where they are what they have
[22:03] done where did they go - did they know
[22:05] their job had ice in their lives they
[22:08] right in the jaws of death through a 25
[22:11] mile line laying in ambush everywhere
[22:13] and the swords a flickering and the
[22:15] shields of blasting but their men their
[22:17] brother that they believed that would be
[22:20] king decide a drink
[22:22] amen and so they did this for the King
[22:25] you know and these three mighty men no
[22:30] question about their bravery about their
[22:33] courage about you know their their men
[22:36] of valor and you know these are some
[22:42] kind of special force special team you
[22:46] know in the Philippines we have the SAP
[22:49] special Action Force of course we have
[22:51] the the sills sill Navy SEALs here you
[22:56] know they're special team and they are
[22:59] very they have so much in them you know
[23:04] and probably these three mighty men
[23:09] they're they have different kinds of
[23:12] specialties maybe one of them is a it's
[23:16] a sniper one is good in close combat you
[23:19] know and so the sniper will be just
[23:22] staying in
[23:23] in a higher place when the two come in
[23:25] and cut through and he just you know
[23:28] even and probably the other one he he
[23:32] has the the container of water is the
[23:34] water boy yeah so he's the water boy but
[23:39] he's still part of the team amen so it's
[23:42] the same thing when we go to mission
[23:44] works amen we are everybody is different
[23:47] but we're part of the team you know we
[23:50] cannot be the same in everything amen
[23:53] but all our talents are being used by
[23:55] God and God is a God of variety amen but
[23:58] the most important thing is to be able
[24:00] to accomplish what is supposed to be
[24:03] accomplished amen and it doesn't also
[24:06] matter where the credit goes a man
[24:08] because what we do just like these three
[24:10] mighty men amen this is not for their
[24:13] own glory but this is something to serve
[24:17] their king
[24:18] amen so it's the same thing that we're
[24:21] doing here here were there amen and
[24:23] everyone is doing his part we
[24:27] accomplished the same thing
[24:29] we also being converted and because
[24:31] we're working as a team Amen it is
[24:33] credited to us and it gives glory to the
[24:36] Lord amen so so that's why he said now o
[24:42] you Bethlehem dwellers in the same
[24:45] message hallelujah I call for men
[24:47] warriors who was not afraid I don't care
[24:50] if there's eight hundred standing on one
[24:52] side and ten thousand on the other
[24:54] I want warriors who will come with me
[24:56] and cut a hole through this line of
[24:59] unbelieving Philistines the world
[25:02] council has got garrison around the Word
[25:06] of God trying to make it Creed's and
[25:08] feed the people there's a well there's a
[25:12] fountain open in the house of David
[25:14] Bethlehem for sin and uncleanliness
[25:17] brothers sin is unbelief in his world
[25:20] amen so now with the denominations have
[25:26] put up you know high walls and fences
[25:31] just to take control amen but we believe
[25:35] we will not stop
[25:37] even speak about the endtime evangelism
[25:39] and we will not stop evangelizing we
[25:43] will not stop doing mission works I mean
[25:45] as long as there is opportunity because
[25:48] the reason why we are still here is that
[25:52] there still souls gender that need to
[25:54] hear this message of the hour to bring
[25:56] them into the fold
[25:58] amen and we need to work together for
[26:02] this purpose
[26:03] amen so just so I said I want warriors
[26:06] who will come with me amen and before we
[26:10] we came to to the States
[26:13] I invited one of the new converts in the
[26:16] message his is probably five to six
[26:21] hours south of Manila and this this
[26:26] pastor his name is rod Alvarez he also
[26:29] belongs to a a prominent organization
[26:34] but we were able to hold the mr. Expo in
[26:39] their group and then he was the first
[26:43] one to step up and he decided to be
[26:48] baptized also along with some of his
[26:51] congregation and he said now bastard I
[26:55] need I need prayers because now the the
[26:58] churches where I am you know where I
[27:00] still belong to them I still join with
[27:04] the fellowship but it looks like little
[27:07] by little you know I feel being there's
[27:11] some some kind of bit because they know
[27:13] that I was already baptized and he said
[27:16] our organization will is going to have a
[27:20] mass baptism and they had the meeting
[27:23] and and he said to what baptism you're
[27:26] going to to to baptize you know and they
[27:30] said they will still baptized in the
[27:32] name of the Father Son and the Holy
[27:34] Spirit and and he said so if that's the
[27:37] way you're going to baptize after all
[27:39] this thing because he already shared you
[27:41] know all these things and he or he he
[27:44] has already read the church age book and
[27:47] he
[27:48] cleared also that brother branham is the
[27:50] prophet and now he said his wife was
[27:53] testifying when when they were in her
[27:56] place prior to his preaching and and his
[27:59] his wife said you know every time we had
[28:03] they have a ministers meeting in the
[28:05] organization and every time he stands
[28:08] and he share his thoughts about the
[28:13] words that that but the scriptures that
[28:16] they're talking about and he is although
[28:18] he is not coating brother branham but he
[28:21] is coating what is what what the prophet
[28:23] has said about those scriptures and
[28:25] everybody's being astonished everybody
[28:27] is you know appreciate what he's saying
[28:29] amen and there are only some ministers
[28:32] that are inviting him to preach for
[28:37] their churches so that's why we really
[28:40] believe that there is really that this
[28:43] message is really the truth amen
[28:45] but even then they feel some some kind
[28:50] of pressure and so last time he said you
[28:53] know we need we need prayers because now
[28:55] I really feel some kind of pressure and
[28:58] he said should I should I leave the
[29:00] organization now and I said don't leave
[29:04] yes stay with them and you know Barry's
[29:08] opportunity you know he just shared them
[29:10] what what so you just keep on studying
[29:12] about this message and so until they're
[29:18] the ones to kick you out you know that's
[29:20] the time you have to leave and last time
[29:23] they actually was their church
[29:25] Thanksgiving and it was the first church
[29:28] Thanksgiving that he invited a minister
[29:31] he was inviting me but we have already
[29:33] flown here but I endorsed my assistant
[29:38] pastor in the church and and he spoke
[29:40] last Sunday so it was the first time
[29:43] that he invited a minister not with from
[29:47] within the organization so he is really
[29:49] standing up and he's really declaring
[29:53] what he is now standing for so we we
[29:56] pray for him because this brother is
[29:58] also influential is also active in
[30:01] pioneering works and he is also
[30:04] establishing many churches so through
[30:07] him we believe that we can expand you
[30:10] know we can still reach more people
[30:13] amen so in continuation he said now like
[30:20] brother Branham said that was that was
[30:21] Christ in David and brother branham he
[30:23] spoke here in God's always find their
[30:26] places he said in product in paragraph
[30:29] 32 he said David said far be that I
[30:32] drink it and he poured it upon the
[30:34] ground as a drink offering to the Lord
[30:37] what a beautiful type of the same thing
[30:40] of this John 3:16 tonight naman God so
[30:44] loved the world that He gave His only
[30:45] begotten Son and then in 33 and what did
[30:48] Christ do the light that he had to live
[30:51] eternally he poured it upon the ground
[30:54] from his veins his natural life upon the
[30:58] ground as a sin offering for us and how
[31:01] the Gentiles they men of honor men great
[31:03] men taking the sword and standing there
[31:05] and cutting their way through to get a
[31:08] fresh drink of water for Christ our
[31:10] David which is very unpopular today so
[31:13] that was a a prophetic act of David when
[31:19] he poured down that water that speaks of
[31:22] Christ Villa Branham said you know and
[31:26] David longed for that water and yet when
[31:31] that water was in front of him of court
[31:34] he accepted it but he didn't drink it
[31:37] not because Birmingham it was not mean
[31:40] Amen but he was portraying a future
[31:47] event amen so that when he when he
[31:50] poured that water into the ground he
[31:52] deprived himself of something he was
[31:56] longing because he realized the
[31:59] sacrifice of these three warriors amen
[32:04] he David in that in so much humility he
[32:10] poured that water I don't deserve this
[32:12] amen only the Lord this
[32:15] this kind of service Amon and so he
[32:19] deprived himself and this spoke bellman
[32:22] so this speaks of Jesus Christ himself
[32:25] because he had eternal he had that life
[32:29] in him amen he was God made flesh here
[32:34] on earth even the blood that was in him
[32:36] but when I'm said was not the blood of a
[32:39] Jew it neither it was a blood of the
[32:41] Gentile it was God's blood amen because
[32:45] that blood was to be poured down into
[32:49] the into Calvary amen
[32:52] for our Redemption amen and what did he
[32:55] do he said he deprived himself a man he
[32:58] was in glory his you know he is the
[33:01] Almighty a man but he went down a man
[33:04] depriving himself of all the glorious
[33:06] thing he had to to obtain but you know
[33:12] he'd applied himself he poured his blood
[33:14] amen and that was the blood you know
[33:17] that he said that he had to live
[33:19] eternally
[33:19] yet he poured it upon the ground from
[33:22] his veins that is natural and like a
[33:24] natural life to the ground as a sin
[33:26] offering for us hallelujah so as they be
[33:30] deprived himself it was the future
[33:35] manifestation of what the Lord did 2,000
[33:38] years ago and now you see in the
[33:40] scriptures there are many things many
[33:43] many occasions or events in the Bible
[33:45] where the bride is always connected with
[33:49] the well amen we remember we remember
[33:53] Eleazer when when Abraham designated
[34:00] Elisha to find the bride for Isaac and
[34:03] Alisa didn't know who that woman is but
[34:09] he knew what kind of a woman his Lord
[34:12] Abraham was desiring for his son Isaac
[34:17] because the servant always knows the
[34:20] desire of his Lord amen and so when when
[34:25] after crossing
[34:27] the the the vast desert you know in so
[34:31] ELISA asked for a sign and he sign and
[34:35] the sign we know that the sign that he
[34:38] asked was whoever will give him drink
[34:41] and not only him but the best with him
[34:44] amen and and so where was he he was in
[34:49] front of the well and so a we saw that
[34:55] in the in Genesis I believe that's in
[34:58] Genesis chapter 24 were you know there
[35:02] of course there were many other women it
[35:04] was not only Rebecca who was there and
[35:07] probably other women offered water to to
[35:14] Elissa to drink and he was waiting for
[35:18] some more drinks were poor the the
[35:20] camels with him you know but no one so
[35:23] they may be beautiful they may be
[35:25] appealing amen
[35:27] but that's not the sign he was looking
[35:29] for amen until there's a woman amen and
[35:32] we know that that's Rebecca and without
[35:36] even asking and after giving him water
[35:39] you know and Rebecca look at those
[35:43] camels and he went up and down you know
[35:47] quite a number of times going back and
[35:50] forth amen and until those those beasts
[35:54] were satisfied amen it was not just few
[36:01] you know going down those stairs because
[36:04] the well at that time were not we're not
[36:07] just the well that we have right now you
[36:09] know they they understand they they dig
[36:12] big holes and then they put stairs on
[36:15] the side that you can go down and carry
[36:18] this this vessel of water so it was not
[36:21] easy but that's the kind of service so
[36:24] what represents Rebecca was the kind of
[36:27] service and that was the one Elisha was
[36:31] looking because the bride the wife amen
[36:35] amen
[36:36] is designed to serve hallelujah
[36:40] just like those warriors they were
[36:43] designed to serve of course they had
[36:46] they were designed to fight but that is
[36:47] in service for the king and his kingdom
[36:50] so Rebecca amen and and so there was no
[36:55] second thought well ELISA that this is
[36:57] the bride for his Lord I saw a man and
[37:00] the good thing there we know that one of
[37:03] the beasts one of the camels that that
[37:06] Rebecca gave water to a man was the same
[37:09] beast that brought her to his to her
[37:12] husband
[37:13] Isaac amen so the same thing in the New
[37:17] Testament there was a woman and he was
[37:21] also in beside the well a man does in
[37:26] John chapter 4 and in John chapter 4 you
[37:30] see it's the same sign he said can you
[37:35] give me drink just like King David oh
[37:39] how I long I could drink what a lot of
[37:43] Bethlehem but Jesus asked the woman he
[37:47] said can you give me drink and the woman
[37:51] was so surprised how come you're here
[37:53] you're dealing with me I'm a Samaritan
[37:55] and you're a Jew amen so the first
[37:58] encounter she understood he was just a
[38:02] mere Jew amen
[38:04] but in the process of their conversation
[38:09] Jesus said well whoever drinks water up
[38:13] did out of this well he will be thirsty
[38:16] again amen
[38:18] but he said out of the water that I'm
[38:20] going to give a man out of him shall
[38:24] flow rivers shall flow rivers of water
[38:27] amen so this is a different kind of
[38:30] water and the woman became thirsty you
[38:33] know that's the good sign of the bride
[38:35] when when she hears the word she feels
[38:38] thirsty she wants more amen and she will
[38:43] be she will she loves for it
[38:47] hallelujah and this is and this design
[38:49] that that woman although in her
[38:52] condition you know
[38:53] we know the situation but she had five
[38:57] men in and she had still no husband a
[39:00] male and she had six already and the man
[39:03] Jesus was the seventh man he said I
[39:06] perceived that you are a prophet because
[39:08] this is the first time they met and and
[39:11] and he knew already what kind of
[39:13] situation he was she was a man and so
[39:17] then the woman later on she realized
[39:23] that he was not only a prophet but he
[39:26] was the Messiah amen and so what
[39:31] happened to the woman he became also the
[39:34] well amen so she ran to the city and you
[39:42] know when when just like in the book of
[39:44] Revelation whoever thirsts come amen and
[39:47] whoever will you know will come and if
[39:50] you are able to to drink a mint then you
[39:54] will now be willing to give out water
[39:57] also amen and and so in the process of
[40:01] their conversation so the woman realized
[40:04] he was the Messiah amen and now this
[40:08] woman got converted something happened
[40:10] to her and now it changed her life he
[40:13] mainly changed her life amen
[40:16] now another scripture in John in let's
[40:20] see in Genesis chapter 26 if you can
[40:23] follow with me let's read in Genesis
[40:25] chapter 26
[40:28] alright here's in verse verse 12 he said
[40:34] this is I said I then Isaac sowed in the
[40:36] land and received in the same year an
[40:38] hundredfold and the Lord blessed him and
[40:41] the man works great and went forward and
[40:43] grew until he became very great for he
[40:46] had possession of flux and possession of
[40:48] herds and great store observance and the
[40:51] Philistines envied him and 15 for all
[40:54] the whales which his father servants had
[40:58] did in the days of Abraham his father
[41:00] the Philistines had stopped them and
[41:03] filled them with earth
[41:05] ayman so during the time of Abraham he
[41:11] was able to dig wells and this means
[41:14] that Abraham dig provided sweet water
[41:20] they had spring in them but you know
[41:23] this Jill jealous Philistines you know
[41:28] this is this is what happened when I
[41:31] went when people became become jealous
[41:35] jealousy is is such a treacherous
[41:40] attitude you know and and people who are
[41:44] who have this kind of attitude you know
[41:47] if they don't have it they don't want
[41:51] others also to help it
[41:54] amen and so what they did with the the
[41:59] AP with the wealth of Abraham they
[42:02] filled it with with dirt they covered
[42:05] amen but one day in verse 17
[42:10] Isaac departed thence and pitched his
[42:13] tent in the valley of juror and he said
[42:19] Isaac dig again the wells of water which
[42:23] they had digged in the days of Abraham
[42:26] his father for the Philistines had
[42:28] stopped them after the death of Abraham
[42:30] and he called their names after the
[42:33] names by which his father had called
[42:35] them amen
[42:37] so it's the same thing with the message
[42:40] that we have right now it's it's not
[42:43] something new but when I'm said it's
[42:46] always there only it is covered amen
[42:50] only it is veiled because there are
[42:54] Philistines and these are the the
[42:58] dominica light and spirit Balaam is even
[43:00] Jezebel spirit in the church amen amen
[43:03] and because of the Cleaves and dogmas
[43:07] the the eyes of the people were being
[43:10] covered
[43:12] and with that as here the whales are
[43:15] being covered also amen but praise God
[43:18] in the last days and this is what have
[43:21] happened today this is not something new
[43:23] in it but our eyes are just open and
[43:27] there is something in us which is the
[43:30] seed of God amen that is able to respond
[43:33] and we realize Amen that there is
[43:36] something into it now aye sir
[43:38] a man realize it's the same piece of
[43:41] land it's the same piece of property
[43:43] that his father Abraham a man had in his
[43:47] day and he knew he knew that the words
[43:50] are just in there being covered and the
[43:56] only thing that David had to do was to
[43:59] dig it again because the spring
[44:02] underneath will not will not disappear
[44:07] it's always there it's always there only
[44:09] it is covered ayman and so he said the
[44:12] nice up serpents dig in the valley and
[44:14] from there a well of springing water and
[44:17] the herd men of gara did stripe with
[44:20] Isaac's headman saying the water is ours
[44:23] and he called the name of the well asset
[44:26] because they strobe with him amen and
[44:29] you know as it means contention in verse
[44:34] 21 and they did another well and strop
[44:37] or duck also and he called the name of
[44:40] it Sydnor which means strife and then in
[44:47] verse 22 and he removed from thence and
[44:51] big another whale and you know God is
[44:53] perfect in 3 amen and he removed from
[44:57] thence and digged another world and for
[44:59] that destroyed not and he called the
[45:02] name of betray Habad and he said for now
[45:04] the Lord had made room for us and we
[45:07] shall be fruitful in the land
[45:09] Amen now it's the same thing there are
[45:12] many people you know the people who did
[45:15] in this message but the only thing that
[45:18] they can find is contention right Amen
[45:22] they find scriptures they plant coat
[45:24] asian amen and the only thing they do is
[45:27] to find somebody to argue with
[45:30] hallelujah amen and then the second the
[45:33] second group is that they did and they
[45:35] could and I so called it Sydnor because
[45:38] it's try even now the same thing also
[45:41] there are many churches today they could
[45:43] not fellowship because they could not
[45:45] they could not agree at some point with
[45:47] something
[45:48] Amen but there are people who are able
[45:51] to dig deeper amen who are able to dig
[45:55] further Amen that they say you know now
[45:58] he said under that went deeper and
[46:00] Hiromu Pontins and dig another well and
[46:02] for that destroyed now amen we did this
[46:07] message not to argue with anyone we did
[46:10] this message not to to abstract the
[46:13] vision
[46:13] Amen but in the tournament with the
[46:16] planter and then any coal that that will
[46:20] remove all and he said for now the Lord
[46:23] had not room for us and we shall be
[46:26] fruitful in the land Amen so there are
[46:30] people amen who who studied this message
[46:33] take this message that to argue not to
[46:36] have division whatsoever but to find a
[46:39] place to be proposed hallelujah amen and
[46:44] I believe I'm looking for a bunch of
[46:46] people who have digged this well a big
[46:49] dis message amen and become fruitful
[46:52] hallelujah amen
[46:54] so now the message speak to the rock let
[47:02] me coated he said it says a great spring
[47:04] or well there and I like what brother
[47:07] Branham said many little wells a perfect
[47:12] type of the church the church he said is
[47:15] the judgment seat where heaven is the
[47:18] great judgment seat of God and the
[47:20] little words represent the little
[47:22] churches all out and judgment begins at
[47:26] the house of God amen and this is what I
[47:29] see amen when Isaac did these whales
[47:33] again
[47:34] amen we have a deacon in the church and
[47:40] his job is to to dig wells and to make
[47:43] artesian well and we have no we have no
[47:47] modern gadgets they have no modern
[47:51] gadgets there but I don't know what they
[47:54] have but you know they just cut a branch
[47:57] a little branch of a certain tree and
[48:00] and then he holds it and I don't know
[48:04] sometimes it move down and when it moves
[48:09] down that points that in that place
[48:11] there is spring underneath and so when
[48:15] when they and they will start to to to
[48:20] put hole and put the pipe you know and
[48:22] then little by little you know when when
[48:25] they did when they got through amen
[48:28] underneath then suddenly there's water
[48:31] in it amen now there are many peoples in
[48:37] the world amen we belong to some other
[48:41] organization I was born a Catholic
[48:43] raised a Catholic even taught in a
[48:47] Catholic school for a year
[48:48] amen you see but I found out just like
[48:53] what butter burns and there are little
[48:55] churches they're little individuals and
[48:57] they are wells it's an every one of us
[49:02] that are here are wells we are well
[49:07] designed to produce to provide water to
[49:13] provide sweet water amen
[49:16] but because of our natural birth amen
[49:22] something happened and the things that
[49:24] we have learned before this world for a
[49:27] long time were not working because the
[49:32] spiritual Philistines put that into it
[49:36] by our natural birth this world could
[49:40] not produce the sweet water it just
[49:45] provides the water because jazz
[49:48] like that water it was Jacob's Well
[49:51] that's what Jesus said whoever drinks
[49:54] out of this water
[49:55] he will be thirsty again and notice that
[49:58] it was even named after Jacob it was
[50:01] named after Israel amen so Jacob is
[50:05] unconverted so whoever drinks of that
[50:07] well will be thirsty again there is no
[50:10] conversion and but God amen the Lord
[50:13] Jesus has provided that water amen and
[50:16] you know the what do they do what what
[50:20] have happened to us because of this
[50:22] message because of this world
[50:24] amen and you know it you know if there
[50:27] is there is an old artesian well you
[50:30] know I
[50:30] you might have that here before amen in
[50:33] the Philippines we have some acid that
[50:34] in in in especially in the provinces but
[50:37] if for a long time you don't use it the
[50:41] water will the water level will go down
[50:43] and it will be hard for you to pump it
[50:47] you know but there is one thing that
[50:49] when we were young what we do we get
[50:52] picture a picture of water a pail and
[50:54] then we pour water down and then we pump
[50:59] and then we listen so we pour water
[51:04] again and then we pump it and then we
[51:07] listen and then we hear something and
[51:09] then little by little there is some some
[51:12] kind of a pressure a power that's
[51:15] holding it and then little by little the
[51:17] water is coming out you know the water
[51:19] is coming out and the first water that
[51:22] will come out you know it's dark it's
[51:25] dirty it's rusty later on it's sandy you
[51:28] know and then and then it becomes
[51:31] clearer and clearer and you know it
[51:32] becomes clearer and clearer as you pump
[51:34] it amen
[51:35] so it's the same thing the first time we
[51:37] heard this message amen it looks like
[51:40] Jesus said the water that I did that I
[51:44] give amen
[51:45] out of the end shall flow rivers of
[51:48] water because you need to drink from it
[51:51] first so that this water once it touched
[51:54] the water
[51:55] down low amen it will serve as Amanda
[51:59] that it will pump it up in and it will
[52:02] produce and you know the pressing when
[52:04] we received this message what comes out
[52:06] of our mouths what comes out you know we
[52:09] we start to repair we start to confess
[52:12] our sins amen
[52:16] because those are the rest those are the
[52:22] decks being down there for a long time
[52:26] amen so but when you drink of this water
[52:30] when we have this message of
[52:33] justification amen we start to realize
[52:36] amen that we are sons and daughters of
[52:38] God and the moment we confess our sins
[52:40] and then things are coming out but
[52:43] little by little lemon out of
[52:44] justification sanctification comes in
[52:47] and then and then the baptism of the
[52:49] holy spirit it becomes clearer and
[52:51] clearer and clearer and now you're not
[52:54] just drinking but you're giving drink
[52:56] also because I love you shalt know
[52:59] amen what you drink this water loop of
[53:03] the message of the hour am a little by
[53:05] little with all these things of the
[53:08] negative things all this bitterness all
[53:10] this they were the things that the
[53:16] spirit the Spirit of Palestine had had
[53:19] aborted amen once this come out
[53:23] hallelujah amen
[53:26] out of you shall flow rivers not just
[53:31] drop but rivers of living water amen
[53:36] hallelujah now in the message broken
[53:39] sister he said in John chapter 7 37 to
[53:42] 38 he said Jesus said in the last days
[53:45] of the Feast of the tabernacle What did
[53:48] he say if any man thirst let him come to
[53:51] me and drink right in a bunch of
[53:53] theologians if any man thirst let him
[53:57] come to me and drink or the scripture
[53:58] has said adobe's innermost being shall
[54:02] flow rivers of living water there's the
[54:07] living fountain
[54:09] the fountain that the people has
[54:10] forsaken today for the Creed they are
[54:14] per se caen the fountain of living water
[54:16] let me introduce you to him and I'm
[54:19] closing he said he to me is that
[54:21] fronting that say beggars like and the
[54:23] child when they were dying in the
[54:25] wilderness I believe is the rock in a
[54:28] certainty to his that rock in a weary
[54:30] land he is the shelter in the time of
[54:33] storm Zakaria 13 he is the fountain
[54:37] that's open in the house of David for
[54:39] sin I believe him to be that and then in
[54:43] some 36 verse 9 he is David's Fountain
[54:46] of Life
[54:46] he is the still waters of David and the
[54:50] green pastures he's the water by the
[54:52] Brookside for David in Genesis 17 he's
[54:56] Abraham's
[54:57] nursing blessed el-shaddai but when his
[55:01] life was gone from him a man a man of a
[55:04] hundred years old how will this thing be
[55:05] I am bought my wife is old how can these
[55:08] things be he said I am el shaddai now L
[55:11] is the the garden and the Shahada is
[55:15] breast and shad is plural which means I
[55:18] am the breasted God like a baby that
[55:21] splatting and it seek and it strength is
[55:22] gone from it lean upon the mother's
[55:25] bosom and nurse it strength back
[55:26] sure when it's nursing it isn't fretting
[55:30] no more at the mother's breast it's
[55:33] satisfied while it's getting its
[55:35] strength amen
[55:37] now that s the well of living water now
[55:42] in press Corinthians chapter 10 in verse
[55:47] 20 said moreover brethren I would not
[55:51] that you should be ignorant
[55:52] Paul said how that all our fathers were
[55:55] under the cloud and all passed through
[55:58] the sea and were all baptized unto Moses
[56:01] in the cloud and in the sea and did all
[56:05] eat the same spiritual meat and did all
[56:08] drink the same spiritual drink for they
[56:10] drank of that spiritual rock that
[56:12] followed them and that rock was Christ
[56:16] amen is a d'autre that follows the
[56:21] people of Israel
[56:22] Paul said that was Christ it followed
[56:26] them wherever they go it followed them
[56:28] whenever they need water to drink their
[56:32] the thirsty it satisfied their thirst
[56:36] wherever they go and he said that rock
[56:40] was Christ
[56:40] meaning anytime they need him anytime
[56:44] they need water to drink it provides
[56:47] water for them amen you know and at this
[56:51] point we just want to to change the
[56:54] thought because in Matthew chapter 27 in
[57:01] verse 33 it says and when they were come
[57:04] unto a place called Golgotha that is to
[57:09] say a place of a skull
[57:10] they gave him vinegar to drink mingled
[57:15] with gall and when he had tasted thereof
[57:18] he would not drink amen
[57:21] and what a situation you know imagine
[57:29] you're very thirsty and you're looking
[57:31] for water to satisfy your thirst and
[57:34] somebody gives you vinegar yeah or
[57:37] something bitter yeah amen
[57:40] it doesn't it's not good amen it's worse
[57:44] but this happened to the Lord 2,000
[57:47] years ago and that was the thing you
[57:51] know he the Lord was being placed in
[57:54] such a situation he was dying physically
[57:58] the life was you know was about to leave
[58:02] that body of flesh and at the brink of
[58:05] there you feel thirsty because brother
[58:08] Burnham said thirst is a sign of death
[58:10] that's why God he said place some some
[58:14] kind of a thirst in a man so that he
[58:18] knows his dying you know when when you
[58:22] feel thirst that means you're dying you
[58:24] need to satisfy that thirst to keep
[58:27] yourself alive right and so Jesus was
[58:30] asking for water so that reminds us of
[58:35] David
[58:36] David was not dying but he wanted to
[58:40] drink what up early
[58:43] who do work probably of meetings
[58:46] planning now he got thirsty and he said
[58:50] oh I love how I love how I wish I could
[58:54] drink out of that water from that layer
[58:57] there's many water available in his
[58:59] palace but he was thirsting for that
[59:06] water in Bali because he knew how sweet
[59:11] it was it's not after for any kind of
[59:15] water it's always available water is
[59:16] always available for David but there's a
[59:19] time that he was really longing for that
[59:22] water now in this same manner 2,000
[59:25] years ago that rock was Christ amen
[59:32] whatever they do remember Moses he heard
[59:37] the truck once because he was just you
[59:41] know helped to speak to that rock and
[59:45] the water will just break out it doesn't
[59:50] he didn't have to to hit that rock now
[59:53] just be but because of the head the
[59:57] congregation his temper came in and he
[1:00:01] hit that rock and that rock was Christ
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:05] but the thing is although Moses did not
[1:00:11] speak but instead he heard that rock
[1:00:15] although that rock was offended but
[1:00:19] still give water many times in our lives
[1:00:28] we disappoint him as a as a as a man I
[1:00:34] disappoint God once in a while even Paul
[1:00:40] said I die daily
[1:00:41] I passed like daily many Paul realized
[1:00:46] how he was
[1:00:49] consistently offending God but God is
[1:00:53] not rough but although beyond despite of
[1:01:00] all these hurt things every time any
[1:01:04] time we need we seek God but I need
[1:01:07] healing Lord I'm in the midst of
[1:01:11] struggles I need your help
[1:01:14] good thirsting for something but God set
[1:01:19] aside the offense that we do against him
[1:01:22] and then he provides satisfying water to
[1:01:26] provide for our thirst amen but at this
[1:01:30] point in time it's a different story
[1:01:32] because now he is the one that is
[1:01:36] needing water is the one that is asking
[1:01:39] give me water
[1:01:41] David I love to drink that water out of
[1:01:44] Bethlehem now this son of David speaking
[1:01:47] 2,000 years ago I need water I love to
[1:01:51] drink that water and he's seeking for
[1:01:54] that water out of Bethlehem amen
[1:01:57] and so but instead they gave him vinegar
[1:02:04] mingled with God and what a mingled with
[1:02:06] God it was better it was terribly sour
[1:02:12] amen now 2,000 years after loud the CNH
[1:02:19] came
[1:02:20] amen his thirsty yeah he's looking for
[1:02:25] water and it's looking for Bethlehem
[1:02:30] hallelujah a nice nap this not just a
[1:02:33] literal bedlam is looking for now
[1:02:35] because Barbara said these little
[1:02:37] Bethlehem's these little wells are the
[1:02:40] churches the little churches the little
[1:02:43] that the individuals the believers
[1:02:45] because in us is a well of living water
[1:02:49] we just have to realize we are dug
[1:02:53] Bethlehem today hallelujah and so he is
[1:02:56] bursting for this water and he wants
[1:02:59] this water to come
[1:03:01] Tobias Bethlehem and Reese's Bethlehem
[1:03:05] today not the denomination is not
[1:03:07] looking for water coming out of Baptists
[1:03:10] trails not from any Pentecostal Wells
[1:03:13] not from the Catholic Wells their wells
[1:03:15] are good their words are very appealing
[1:03:18] attractive to the eyes of all the people
[1:03:21] amen but these are broken sisters but we
[1:03:29] have the bridegroom today looking for
[1:03:34] that word he is thirsty and there must
[1:03:38] be a Bethlehem today to Sweetwater amen
[1:03:45] we just come out this little badly not
[1:03:50] Baptist we're not against the people in
[1:03:55] those wells amen but we we know what
[1:04:01] we're saying but the bride today is that
[1:04:04] living well and he identified that bride
[1:04:10] he wants to drink
[1:04:12] the Lord is thirsting and that's why he
[1:04:15] said in the loudest in the same church
[1:04:18] he doesn't want a lukewarm water that
[1:04:23] lukewarm water coming out of this
[1:04:26] various well I mean it doesn't taste
[1:04:29] good it doesn't even smell good no sweet
[1:04:33] sour amen
[1:04:35] in another smelling item for the Lord
[1:04:40] it's not after that no matter how good
[1:04:43] their cups are amen
[1:04:46] but today it's the bride which is the
[1:04:49] Bethlehem of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:04:51] he is looking for that water but only
[1:04:54] his Bethlehem only the bride today can
[1:04:59] produce and how can we do that
[1:05:03] just like that illustration that old
[1:05:05] well amen you need to pour in something
[1:05:08] into it so that it can reach
[1:05:12] spring deep down amen and so that sweet
[1:05:18] water out of Bethlehem needs a pouring
[1:05:23] from the message of the app so that's
[1:05:26] why we need to drink and drink
[1:05:29] hallelujah and when we started to drink
[1:05:32] amen and when it reach down there to the
[1:05:35] spring which is our heart where our soul
[1:05:39] is a mint suddenly something squeaking
[1:05:42] there something strike there and it
[1:05:47] opens up amen and little by little all
[1:05:51] this things all this stuff came out amen
[1:05:54] and he said brother Brennan again let me
[1:06:01] let me coat this he just illustrated at
[1:06:04] one time when he was he was a great game
[1:06:06] warden let me just read it I remember
[1:06:08] when I used to was the State game warden
[1:06:12] of Indian I used to go by in Harrison
[1:06:14] County a certain well a spring I was it
[1:06:17] was always bubbling up and just so it
[1:06:20] looked like it was the most happiest
[1:06:22] thing whether the snow was on the ground
[1:06:25] ice was froze how cold it was it's still
[1:06:28] bubble where the old man made pants and
[1:06:31] tongues with frogs and everything was
[1:06:33] out there froze over solid and that goes
[1:06:36] to show that any denomination threw a
[1:06:40] little lack of spirit or a little change
[1:06:43] of atmosphere will freeze over but God's
[1:06:47] artesian well he's the same yesterday
[1:06:50] today and forever it keeps all the
[1:06:54] things bubbled out of it and shoved out
[1:06:57] of it and there is none in there to
[1:07:00] begin with the minute it gets into it it
[1:07:03] will push it out of the way that thing
[1:07:07] was bubbling up like that and I said sat
[1:07:09] down there one day I thought I believe
[1:07:12] I'll talk to that spring just for a
[1:07:13] moment I took off my hat and I said what
[1:07:17] are you so happy about what are you
[1:07:19] babbling so about maybe it's because the
[1:07:21] dish drink from you once in a while if
[1:07:23] he could have spa
[1:07:25] can hit up said no I said maybe it's
[1:07:28] because that I drink from you now that
[1:07:32] isn't there I said well what's making
[1:07:34] you so pure so clean what is it bubbling
[1:07:38] that makes you bubble full of joy all
[1:07:40] the time and nothing can freeze you over
[1:07:43] you're spurting up in the air and there
[1:07:46] is nothing clean water if it could have
[1:07:49] spoken to me you know what that well
[1:07:51] would have said he'd have said brother
[1:07:53] branham it isn't me bubbling it's
[1:07:57] something behind me
[1:07:59] bubbling me and that's the way it is
[1:08:02] that's a poor word but you know what it
[1:08:05] about I mean and that's the way it's
[1:08:07] with a born-again experience you cannot
[1:08:10] contain it it's a well of water within
[1:08:13] you bubbling up into everlasting life
[1:08:17] see there is something about it that you
[1:08:19] have nothing to do with the magnet hands
[1:08:22] may freeze and then begging for revival
[1:08:24] and everything but a man that's under
[1:08:27] that fountain living in that fountain
[1:08:29] it's day and night no you don't have to
[1:08:33] wait on local drains and local rebels
[1:08:35] you're full of it
[1:08:37] I'll give it unto him a fountain of life
[1:08:39] in him bubbling under something in a
[1:08:41] best fresh every day pure and clean
[1:08:43] it's the unadulterated Word of God in
[1:08:46] your heart and not vindicating itself
[1:08:48] speaking for itself I don't care whether
[1:08:50] it's raining whether it's snowing what
[1:08:52] kind of weather this you are still happy
[1:08:55] because the Holy Spirit is in there
[1:08:58] bubbling up it's the hidden power amen
[1:09:01] oh it's secret it's within a theme and
[1:09:03] that's why believers that we believers
[1:09:06] should be the most happiest people
[1:09:08] living here on earth and sometimes
[1:09:11] people get sick but you know what makes
[1:09:14] them see is just that they're just so
[1:09:17] sad amen you know sadness brings
[1:09:20] loneliness and then later on it becomes
[1:09:23] it gives you more sickness in it now it
[1:09:26] gives up itself freely to whomsoever
[1:09:28] will drink and use its substance now you
[1:09:32] don't have to pick out saying well now I
[1:09:34] just have to go to the Methodist Church
[1:09:35] because I'm a method
[1:09:37] for a revival I'll have to go over here
[1:09:39] but I have to go a Pentecostal because
[1:09:41] I'm a Pentecostal revivalist I'm telling
[1:09:44] you when you got that well of water
[1:09:47] springing up that fountain when you're
[1:09:50] drinking by there there is no difference
[1:09:52] you give to anything that comes by
[1:09:55] you're willing to give hope of life to a
[1:09:59] Catholic to a Protestant to a Jew to an
[1:10:02] atheist or whatever it is you really
[1:10:04] really got something in you that's doing
[1:10:07] it
[1:10:08] hallelujah so we're here where we become
[1:10:12] the fountain because the fount we
[1:10:14] receive here
[1:10:15] he's the fountain of living water but
[1:10:17] very spring inside us amen the whoever
[1:10:21] comes to us whoever Easterns when they
[1:10:24] approach us they become satisfied people
[1:10:28] approach you they're discouraged but
[1:10:31] they leave you the tender but they
[1:10:33] become encouraged because they were able
[1:10:36] to drink from you amen he is the main
[1:10:41] source amen but we are also found we are
[1:10:44] also Springs of water that we can give
[1:10:48] waters to do those who are in need
[1:10:50] hallelujah Amen and so that's why in
[1:10:54] Revelation chapter 22 verse 17 and the
[1:10:57] spirit and the bride say come
[1:10:58] and let him that heareth say come and
[1:11:01] let him that is athirst come and
[1:11:03] whosoever will let him take the water of
[1:11:07] life freely Amen hallelujah so the same
[1:11:11] thing as you've made mentioned that
[1:11:12] woman at the well she ran to the city
[1:11:14] and brought in more people that were
[1:11:17] able to drink amen there was a man there
[1:11:21] were men Paul and Silas they were able
[1:11:24] to drink out of this fountain of life
[1:11:27] amen Paul used to drink from that water
[1:11:31] from the denomination from the seminary
[1:11:33] he was in amen but that water he drank a
[1:11:38] mint made him to persecute the believers
[1:11:43] and even persecuted Jesus because he was
[1:11:47] drinking from another source
[1:11:49] I mean but the moment he met that source
[1:11:52] and at the moment he started to drink
[1:11:55] out of the fountain of life his life
[1:11:57] changed even the people he was
[1:12:01] surrounded with with with with other
[1:12:03] group of people this this that the same
[1:12:06] people he was persecuting now he became
[1:12:09] one with them and all of them were
[1:12:12] drinking from the same counting and
[1:12:14] because they were drinking from the same
[1:12:16] fountain it produced the same kind of
[1:12:18] life in them
[1:12:19] hallelujah steepened because he was able
[1:12:22] to drink from that source hallelujah
[1:12:25] Jesus the source when he was right there
[1:12:27] at the cross of Calvary he said Father
[1:12:29] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:12:31] do
[1:12:32] amen and Stephen was able to drink from
[1:12:35] that source he must've found it but that
[1:12:38] steepened drank from and sleeper said
[1:12:40] when he was persecuted what sleep and
[1:12:43] said Amen Lord don't discount against
[1:12:46] them it produced the same light it
[1:12:49] produced the same reaction upon any any
[1:12:51] action hallelujah why because he was
[1:12:54] able to drink from that source amen and
[1:12:57] so the same thing Paul and Silas amen
[1:13:00] the Paul was able to drink from that
[1:13:02] fountain from that source and now it
[1:13:04] changed his ways it changed the world
[1:13:07] coming out from his mouth hallelujah he
[1:13:09] was one with the people because they
[1:13:11] were drinking from the same source now I
[1:13:13] will happily between drinking from the
[1:13:16] same source we will be preaching the
[1:13:18] same thing hallelujah
[1:13:21] and so now we will be producing the same
[1:13:23] kind of life Paul and Silas they were
[1:13:26] caught amen they did that react they
[1:13:29] were beaten almost to death and then
[1:13:32] later on they were imprisoned but they
[1:13:35] were so they they had so much in them
[1:13:37] they become also the spring the source
[1:13:42] in the rivers of water were flowing from
[1:13:45] them that at the middle of the night
[1:13:47] amen when they when they they woke up
[1:13:51] that spring kept bubbling it kept on
[1:13:56] pumping them and they could not contain
[1:13:58] themselves behind em
[1:14:00] beyond those paints those rooms that
[1:14:03] they had the bruises it didn't stop them
[1:14:07] because there's something in them that
[1:14:09] kept bubbling
[1:14:10] hallelujah come on Paul let's worship
[1:14:12] the Lord come on Silas I was waiting for
[1:14:15] you so why because there is something in
[1:14:18] them even in any kind of circumstances
[1:14:20] any in any kind of situation if there is
[1:14:23] a spring in us it will keep pumping and
[1:14:27] bubbling hallelujah amen and the bubble
[1:14:30] will come out and we cannot get rid of
[1:14:32] it
[1:14:32] hallelujah and so they they worship they
[1:14:35] praise they pray amen and what happened
[1:14:39] there's a thirsty vessel there this is
[1:14:44] thirsty vessel there a mate what shall I
[1:14:47] do
[1:14:48] amen and from him there are other
[1:14:53] thirsty vessels
[1:14:55] turn another well even the guard of the
[1:15:00] jail who who almost committed suicide
[1:15:04] amen
[1:15:06] they were there but because he heard and
[1:15:09] because he witnessed the way Paul and
[1:15:12] Silas Lee after amen it was wide open
[1:15:15] but they remained there they stayed
[1:15:18] there because there is a vessel there is
[1:15:23] a spring that needs to be watered amen
[1:15:27] and then later on you know what happened
[1:15:29] it didn't stop there amen you in your
[1:15:32] house even his family
[1:15:36] amen later on was father they were also
[1:15:39] vessels they were also wells and they
[1:15:42] only needed a man part of that water
[1:15:46] from the source amen so it's the same
[1:15:49] thing just like you know another thing
[1:15:51] in the book of Revelation we know he
[1:15:54] said that there is a voice of many
[1:15:56] waters
[1:15:57] you know the Bible said in Revelation
[1:16:01] speak there is the voice of many waters
[1:16:03] and Birmingham said also he pointed to
[1:16:09] another scripture he said it the voice
[1:16:11] of many waters is the
[1:16:13] multigon amen and this was being lent
[1:16:22] this verse was being lined up
[1:16:24] amen in Revelation chapter 19 rejoice
[1:16:27] and be glad for the marriage of the lamb
[1:16:30] is come and his wife had made herself
[1:16:32] ready so you know when you at times
[1:16:38] which they do this you know and when you
[1:16:40] are when people wants to have some kind
[1:16:44] of rest you know they did the you know
[1:16:47] when you're beside the still waters you
[1:16:50] know this was vertical this the the
[1:16:53] sound that this water the flow of the
[1:16:56] river you know it gives some kind of
[1:16:58] resting condition amen and so sometimes
[1:17:04] people they make this artificial sound
[1:17:07] also like a flowing river it does good
[1:17:12] to amen and we put that thing and you
[1:17:16] know just like a man you know resting
[1:17:19] and and he is hearing this kind of sound
[1:17:23] like a flowing river it's like in the
[1:17:27] book of the book of Revelation it is the
[1:17:30] voice of many waters it's the great
[1:17:34] multitude and with this voice of many
[1:17:36] waters the bride amen so the Lord is
[1:17:43] just resting and this bubbling sound
[1:17:47] from our hearts even just like the the
[1:17:52] water coming out of the bride today amen
[1:17:56] is good to hear by the bridegroom
[1:17:59] himself it's the voice of many waters
[1:18:03] because the the the channel's the
[1:18:08] channels are being open and so these
[1:18:12] waters are just coming out freely
[1:18:15] and it's a good thing to hear by the
[1:18:19] breakroom
[1:18:22] our worship
[1:18:24] our prayers are like flowing rivers
[1:18:29] voice of many waters amen
[1:18:37] in Revelation chapter 4 rotation he said
[1:18:40] alright here was voices oh how we need
[1:18:45] in jeffersonville thousands of live
[1:18:49] voices he said this was Jeffersonville
[1:18:51] but I believe he's saying this to the
[1:18:52] bride did the whole world thousands of
[1:18:55] lived voices the Thunder of God
[1:18:59] thundering out in sweetness and holiness
[1:19:03] purity and defiled lives walking around
[1:19:07] in the earth today without a blemish yes
[1:19:11] sir real Christians that standard
[1:19:14] against the enemy the devil don't care
[1:19:17] how loud you can holler the devil don't
[1:19:20] care how much you can jump or how much
[1:19:21] you can do this or shout but what hurts
[1:19:24] the devil is to see that sanctified holy
[1:19:29] life consecrated to God say anything to
[1:19:32] him call him anything
[1:19:33] just a sweet as it can be and move right
[1:19:36] on oh my that rose him away
[1:19:38] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:19:42] hallelujah in sweetness and holiness and
[1:19:45] purity and defiled lives you know today
[1:19:48] there's so much hatred you read
[1:19:53] newspaper so much hatred
[1:19:56] you know bla against why sometimes black
[1:20:02] against black or white against watching
[1:20:04] so much bitterness the world is full a
[1:20:09] bit full of negativism amen
[1:20:13] he cannot drink from it but the bride
[1:20:17] will always produce sweetness it's
[1:20:19] always sweetness rice the mystery of God
[1:20:26] revealed if the brother you think is a
[1:20:28] little wrong or the sisters say Lord
[1:20:30] don't let me never have the root of
[1:20:32] bitterness Springer because it will
[1:20:35] affect him and it will take the cry
[1:20:38] out of my life that poison acids of
[1:20:42] malice and jealousy and hatred that will
[1:20:46] just take the Holy Spirit right away
[1:20:48] from you it will run him from the
[1:20:50] tabernacle here it will kill the Spirit
[1:20:53] of God or drive it away from here
[1:20:54] hurt your pastor it will do everything
[1:20:57] don't you do that hallelujah so God is
[1:21:02] he's desiring his thirsting he's longing
[1:21:06] he wish like David how I longed I could
[1:21:11] drink out of the water of Bethlehem and
[1:21:14] may we be little Bethlehem's provide
[1:21:18] sweet water remember what we do amen
[1:21:22] what we ever we say whatever we think
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:25] these are waters amen and with us last
[1:21:32] scripture that we read this in Matthew
[1:21:36] chapter 26 this another woman here in
[1:21:39] verse 7 there came unto him a woman
[1:21:44] having an alabaster box of very precious
[1:21:47] ointment and poured it on his head as he
[1:21:49] sat at meat but when his disciples saw
[1:21:52] it they had indignation saying to what
[1:21:57] purpose is this race for this island
[1:22:01] might have been solved for much and
[1:22:04] given to the poor when Jesus understood
[1:22:07] it he said unto them why trouble ye the
[1:22:10] woman for she hath wrought a good work
[1:22:13] upon me now this is service for ye have
[1:22:19] the poor always with you but me have not
[1:22:22] always for in that she had poured
[1:22:25] disappointment on my body she did it for
[1:22:29] my birria verily I say unto you
[1:22:33] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[1:22:35] preached in the whole world there shall
[1:22:37] also this that this woman had done be
[1:22:40] told for a memorial of her now remember
[1:22:44] number one this woman although she was a
[1:22:48] sinner
[1:22:50] but she was able to discern the time
[1:22:55] that Jesus said she did it for my birria
[1:23:00] amen she did this kind of service for my
[1:23:04] birria but today there's another woman
[1:23:08] which is the bride of Jesus Christ which
[1:23:11] is doing a service not for his burial
[1:23:15] hidden it happened already 2000 years
[1:23:18] ago but we're doing a service today not
[1:23:22] to bury the Lord Napoli's Burien but
[1:23:25] this is poured the body change amen the
[1:23:28] service that we do is not for the burial
[1:23:32] but for the resurrection but the wrap
[1:23:34] for the coming rapture
[1:23:36] amen and so we represent we are being
[1:23:38] represented by this woman 2000 years ago
[1:23:42] amen now remember water was also
[1:23:44] involved also it would not because water
[1:23:49] is just a kind of service and that water
[1:23:52] that the Warriors gave to them it was
[1:23:54] just a form of service to the king amen
[1:24:00] now at this point the water was also
[1:24:03] represented not to be dread but a
[1:24:06] service because Simon invited Jesus but
[1:24:11] he was not welcome because if he was
[1:24:15] welcomed that he was able to give him
[1:24:17] water amen
[1:24:19] not to drink not just to drink but also
[1:24:22] to was his feet but no one gave him
[1:24:27] water to drink neither to wash his feet
[1:24:31] amen and so Jesus was longing for a
[1:24:35] service but this kind of woman a woman
[1:24:44] the moment she realized nobody gave
[1:24:49] water
[1:24:49] nobody wash the feet of Jesus and you
[1:24:52] know what the what words what was the
[1:24:54] next thing she ran to the to the store
[1:24:56] and bought and and got you know and I
[1:25:00] would like to believe that the money she
[1:25:02] had
[1:25:03] in her was not a good money amen but in
[1:25:11] this case it was God is always on top of
[1:25:16] every situation
[1:25:18] he knew that woman from the start he
[1:25:23] knew who she was he knew what kind of
[1:25:25] life she had he knew what kind of money
[1:25:30] she had in possession amen
[1:25:33] so this woman needs to be washed and
[1:25:39] only forgiveness can wash her amen and
[1:25:42] so that situation made the bad money in
[1:25:48] her was to be in exchange of something
[1:25:53] for service to the Lord
[1:25:56] and now she no longer had that money and
[1:26:00] what she had was an alabaster box with
[1:26:04] the precious ointment amen and he and
[1:26:08] she poured it upon his head because she
[1:26:11] recognized Jesus as her amen
[1:26:16] it's the same thing that we do we
[1:26:18] recognize our head today we give juice
[1:26:22] service to our head which is Jesus
[1:26:25] Christ amen
[1:26:27] and so down low and then little by
[1:26:29] little you know and and he knelt down
[1:26:31] and there was no water available amen
[1:26:37] but when when he when she knelt down and
[1:26:43] that precious ointment was flowing down
[1:26:45] just like a run you know from his head
[1:26:48] to the beard to the garment down to the
[1:26:50] foot amen and she could not even look up
[1:26:55] to see the face of the Lord but she was
[1:26:58] repenting she was confessing
[1:27:00] she was bowing amen and then suddenly
[1:27:03] Jesus called Simon what can you say what
[1:27:08] do you think who will rejoice more the
[1:27:12] one who was more there or the one who
[1:27:16] was little
[1:27:17] and for both of them are okay who will
[1:27:19] rejoice more and Simon knew what Jesus
[1:27:23] was telling about and also that woman
[1:27:27] fell it was rebuilt or what Jesus was
[1:27:31] saying that means it was a signal that
[1:27:34] her sins were forgiven and faith cometh
[1:27:42] by hearing and then that thing fell into
[1:27:44] his heart and as if he was the woman for
[1:27:48] a long time was able to drink because
[1:27:51] all her life she heard was accusation
[1:27:56] you're a bad woman
[1:27:58] you're an adulteress sure you're a dirty
[1:28:01] woman you don't deserve to live
[1:28:04] everything that she heard but for the
[1:28:07] first time she heard something from her
[1:28:10] head imminent that fell into his heart
[1:28:13] and it looks like a water to that dried
[1:28:17] artesian well and it dropped into the
[1:28:20] channel suddenly I could imagine just
[1:28:24] like that artesian and there was a deep
[1:28:30] what you call the groaning even there
[1:28:34] was a deep cry and a cry from Medan are
[1:28:38] to be repented heart Hindman and
[1:28:41] suddenly all the channels even came open
[1:28:45] wide open and those channels little by
[1:28:49] little
[1:28:50] hallelujah from her eyes flow rivers of
[1:28:55] water even and it was not just a small
[1:29:00] amount of water that came out of her
[1:29:03] over eyes amen
[1:29:05] and those those tears did not come from
[1:29:08] somewhere it comes from her heart
[1:29:11] Heymann and she was able to ask the feet
[1:29:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:29:16] out of that Anissa and brother Branham
[1:29:19] said the only decent part of that woman
[1:29:21] was her long hair amen and of course
[1:29:24] he's repented heart amen
[1:29:27] and so now out of that came
[1:29:30] the water in wash the feet of the Lord
[1:29:34] Jesus and that was the Atmos service
[1:29:38] that the Lord was able to receive he was
[1:29:42] thirsty he came to the temple one thing
[1:29:46] wanting to drink no one wants to give
[1:29:48] him water because they want to give
[1:29:51] their own water just like the broken
[1:29:55] cisterns they rejected the fountain of
[1:29:57] living water and then they dig their own
[1:30:00] sister he was rejected same thing two
[1:30:06] thousand years ago two thousand years
[1:30:08] after that a man in this age
[1:30:10] many churches many denominations
[1:30:12] organization big organization rejected
[1:30:15] the message of the hour which is the
[1:30:18] source but you should be glad tonight
[1:30:23] ayman that you open your heart and this
[1:30:28] water flow truly down to your heart and
[1:30:31] all the channels came or wide open and
[1:30:35] it's giving service to the Lord is
[1:30:38] giving sweetness amen
[1:30:42] and it's one thing desiring that's the
[1:30:47] voice of many waters that is hearing our
[1:30:50] service amen in the Old Testament he is
[1:30:55] always following Israel giving water
[1:30:58] giving water he still does this is
[1:31:01] provides water today that we need
[1:31:03] whenever we need it he will provide it
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:08] but on the other end we have to realize
[1:31:11] he's like David how long I could drink
