service for sure so remember these and the announcements I know you've prayed about all these things remember brother Benny and keep him in your prayers and keep June in your heart I talked with her just a moment ago she said her blood pressure now was like it was I think she said 157 over 85. but it had gotten real high it was up 200 and something over like 130 and that was real high but she's doing better and all but she just stayed there at home and trying to relax and she's viewing in today and and she'll you know the Lord will reach down and touch her remember Wade said he was doing fine everything's going great so we we thank the Lord for that all right any other announcements just remember that the ladies now make sure you get everything ready you know the food the doings and to the brothers that some of you you know make sure you bring some drinks and things you know for to be able to be used to dire and then we always have enough the next day to generally eat and do so bring good many drinks if you will but that'll be on the 21st and we pray that the Lord would bless I think that's all the announcements Lord Jesus we've asked you about brother pageant now we ask you to just come and touch our hearts the Lord is we try to meditate upon you and to talk about your word we love you we thank you and we know that you love us because look what you've done for us look where you've brought us look at the healings the things that we've witnessed within our lives and the doings of coming down to where we are now and then Lord most of all to open your word unto us to bring Salvation to our souls and to deliver your word that we may be able to walk therein we thank you for that and we Praise Your Great Name and ask you to just have your way with us tonight and lead us in Jesus name all right revelation one of these days we're going to get back to Revelation and I turn to see the voice that Spate with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle all right let's go over now we picked up trying to cover Genesis one and we're going to try to pull together with Genesis 1 and and going into Genesis 2. if we can tonight if you have enough time all right Genesis 1 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them know what's to them and and all that have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all of the earth and over ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him what's now male and female created he them right one being and God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and all upon the Earth all right now we drop over to 2 7. to try to pull up our point tonight and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust to the ground and breathed into his nostrils or Breath of Life and Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed all right we'll wait on the other verse 9 or later you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we tried to cover this past Sunday on the creation of man of Genesis 1 26 and 27. and I I pray that that you know I don't want to spend so much time to just trying to pound on something but I want to make sure you understand what I'm saying and then it's up to God to reveal that if it's true if not then he'll show you that it's not true that's no problem and then you can help me with it well what did we find out about this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27. that he was created a spiritual man a spiritual being the prophet called it a supernatural being uh he would call it a theophany he would call it a low gosh he would call it the words bringing it down to connecting all of it together and and bringing it out and showing who this was and then he would bring it down to be the son of God in the image of God well now what is the son of God see we we have been taught back prior to we heard of the message that you know oh yeah your son of God you do this or that or the other maybe if even they knew anything about it but in no way would they try to connect anything back to in the eternities and try to bring it down because we didn't understand but it's not that God created a son the because that's what a lot of people think because they know that Jesus Christ is the creator of John 1 Hebrews 1 Colossians 1 James 2 and 9. you just go on with the scriptures that Jesus Christ is the creator now not Jesus the flesh the flesh was not back there it had a beginning about 2 000 years ago and was be called in the beginning of the creation of God to begin in the wound of a woman all right and we covered how that Adam was God's created son but that Jesus was God's only begotten he said begotten by a woman that's the only time you know that any anyone came forth like he did in the doing even in Adam in his great doings was nothing compared to the Lord Jesus and his coming forth because it would not have been but we're trying to talk about one true and living God all right so then if we're created in the image of God it's not some likeness that you're trying to make or trying to form out and we need to find out what he looked like and oh yeah well we know um maybe he looked like Hoffman well then we need to all look like Hoffman I guess if we're going to be in that image or lightness but it's not exactly that away is it right it's the understanding of one true and living God all right that God never sent a son to die for you and I he came himself right well he never sent a son in the beginning he came himself it was his condescending down to bringing it to us and seeing you know Mankind and what it is and we covered Sunday now and I hope that will stick with you that we covered it in a twofold minor of talking or two-part whatever you want to call it that's not making it too much I don't have that education but uh we covered it that where it says that that it create man in His image and we covered that as the natural human being in the basis of the natural human being all mankind is in that form because there are a little Creator they're this they're that or the other but just remember now this man of 126 and 27 there was a special creation because there's nowhere in the natural of mankind that you can say that a man was made male and female I hope that went soaked into where you can think about it a little there was nothing in the human race that you can talk about male and female I Peggy wouldn't taken out of me I'd make her that much worse but see this man then of 126 and 27 would be a different man and I know that I try to lay things out for you to think about and we're trying to comprehend God remember the quote we gave that we can find out about how that God you know what God is we can find out what we are all right if we find out what we are we can find out what God is all right because if we're in the image then we are a an offspring and this man of 126 and 27 is an offspring from God all right it's one person because you can't make it many persons you can make that that one person a multiple form if you want to to try to bring it in to see you know that it would represent all that would receive eternal life and be in The Bride of Jesus Christ would be represented right there in in Genesis 1. all right we went back before the world in the bases that all mankind the prophet says were created in the image of God as because of a Creator but that was in the mind of God all right then he would know what everybody would do he would know whatever person would do and how they would be and and whatever because of in his mind but I've always tried my best to preach to you one thing be careful how you're dealing with your predestinations and your mind because you might just predestinate yourself out of existence right because if you're going to go back to where he was self-existing and he dwelt alone then we certainly wasn't people back there with him because he wouldn't be dwelling alone I try to make those statements where you can think about it like the statement has said that all mankind could be in the image of God as a Creator or something but there's no way that mankind can be male and female within one body but this man was made first spiritual in the image of God that's male and female all right then when Adam was put in flesh you know the flesh man Adam was what male and female right now you can't delay that at the end to just the human race I don't think here what you think you know that you well I think it's this way thank you well that's all right go ahead were you thinking but how are you going to put it there but this one that was created in 126 and 27 was not a creation no more than God was a creation remember we went through all of those things trying to explain what the prophet was saying that God was his first creation and out of God come the logos and out of the logos came to man well where did God begin our word creation signifies a beginning where did he begin so then that's just using terminologies or words to express something that will hide it from the wise and prudent but he where he can reveal it to his children his offspring all right see then that man that was created in 126 and 27 is a male and female creation now only God can do that right right only God could bring forth that situation right and then I told you I said and you remember we had it on the drawings and we had the things and we used it a good bit remember what I told you then that brother Branham said that in Adam and Eve was his desire for all of his children right do you know then that you can make that the Christ right your Prophet did he said that was the Christ that was back there or all right the Christ can be male and female now hold that real close with your mind without running and jangling too much the Bible speaks of man and wife and speaks of Christ in the church right all right Christ in the church as man and wife but remember in the body of Christ he is the male and the bride is the female made up of male and female right so it's hard to express it isn't it in the body of Christ is male and female right as human beings but there's only one Holy Ghost and that's not the doctrine that they had in Florida years ago about a male Holy Ghost and a female holy ghost that don't work no just leave it like it is right that is Christ in the church the prophet said all right Christ in the church can be male and female right but you understand what I mean see the the men in the body of Christ are female that can't be done in natural talkings can it you're talking about the bride of Christ and see there in Adam was the perfect example of what God wanted to come out in the end time to where it would be Christ and the church together as one again to bring it back like it was supposed to have been bruh I didn't give this one to him but I told y'all Sunday I'd find it for you because I made a quote listen this is taken from spoken word is Original Seed paragraph 2 16 through 218. and he says well that's the thing same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here right supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the fall but being that you're predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back where you were predestinated he said amen I said never saw that before he caught that right then as a revelation to him brings you right what what makes what makes you believe the word and turn down these other things what makes you believe the word and turn down these other doctrines there has to be some connection but it's not physically or genetically or as we've mankind has tried to make it but what does he say he said you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but remember if it had come that way they would have been no attributes of God displayed right so it didn't come that way all right but then what are we going to do is not the whole story of redemption to take us back to where we should have been in the beginning he sitting on what he's saying to bring us right back to the place to be The Offspring of God well to me that's what he started off in Genesis 1 26 and 27 because that's not the physical man that's the spiritual man right male and female created he them male and female created him the scripture says right this is one person brother Randall called it a theophany he called it the logos we've been through all of these things over he called it the son of God right right then we should consider these things and and not be so jumbled up and try to think about something having the beginning because it's got the word beginning the Earth or creation see get down to the point of seeing Christ and what he wanted to do but he's now doing it through his bride bringing her back to that place we'll get down a little bit to it think about it you remember this quote go ahead with number one and let's start because we're going to try to get to Eve tonight now is what we're trying to get to is to understand about Eve we went through two Services I put in both Services Sunday went back and viewed those messages to see if there was anything I needed to try to put in you know and and none of you didn't but I did to make sure because I want to make sure it's right but was you concerned enough to even consider what was said all right this quote we gave it Sunday but this is from demonology of Physical Realm 53. paragraph 27. but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image so when was this man of 126 and 27 created just because it winds up at the end of chapter one it's like I've told you if you want to sit down sometime and let's just tear that one tear that apart we know Man was created on the sixth day right right we know the animals was created on the fifth day but take that and look at it looks like he's trying to pull it over into the sixth day that man was created on the sixth day physically it's not talking about his spiritual creation that's what your Prophet is saying this spiritual creation was before the world because it would be an impartation of God's own life and we'll get to it in a minute we tried Sunday to explain it because that's what God gave to Adam he gave him eternal life all right but your souls were made up before the foundation were okay All Souls in the mind of God he knew every one of them for the foundation world but did he make them let me let me you know did he make songs and put them in little cubicles little spaces and then when you come on Earth you say that's silly I know it that's what I'm trying to expose is how silly our minds are God didn't have to bring into being any Soul before the world he had it in his mind that made it more real than anything could ever be when we got here right so then all mankind of all over the world has ever been in the world God knew in his mind before the world would it be with this man is a special one because this is the manifestation of himself he says offspring it's his children when God created man and his own image Spirit of man not a man in his own image because man is fleshed you know in the animal but man in his own Embassy and then he made them male and female before he ever had a man in the dust of the Earth so now you know which one he's talking about right I wish we had a chance this after two can break it down you know that's between the line remember that in the message you know it's not written out on the line it's between the lines but just remember what's between the lines has got to be what the line says now that's not L I always say that l-i-n-e says all right it just took somebody to bring it out we could read Adam I mean we could read about Abraham and Sarah and his King falling in love with grandma but we couldn't figure that out But Here Come a prophet that made a simple statement it says they were turned back Young see he was reading between the lines right but it couldn't be no different or what was online see that's what people say well I know the line says one God but I read between the lines I got three now you got off the line right right so what's what he's saying now it's between the line but when you see it comes right up with the line you read it Shake ahead somebody's getting sleepy so read off the board see had gone back in the beginning what he did there and how he moved down into the Earth and how that he made Man In His Image and then God turned around and was made in the image of man to redeem the man so now we've read between the lines we've read the line that all man has made in the image of God and we know that he's in the mind of God and that's fine but now we read between the line and we find one man because we can't read on the line that all mankind you know everybody was made male and female right so now we've got to drop between the lines bringing up another man this man is Christ this is eternal life because did we read it Sunday where it read around and said that he put into Adam eternal life they need to become an eternal person with God well he said he simply put what the 126 man into the two seven right so the part to be and I know you don't like that most people don't like to use the word part but you show me where that and I love the way brother random brain he said we're a part of God I rejoice when I read that to find out I'm a part of God now I don't care what part I am right if I if I'm a toenail or a fingernail whatever I whatever he wants to make me that's the part I want to be because that part is just as much God as the rest of it your toenail's not part of somebody else it is you've got a toenail transplant somewhere all right something went wrong all right but are you with me now what your souls were made up now he's supposed to be talking to the church the bride of Christ the Bible's not written to the center right it says to the Saints at Ephesus it says to the Saints here it says the Bible brother said is not written to The Sinner it is written to those that are in Christ Jesus all right but see he's speaking to those that are in Christ Jesus set before the foundation of the world when God created man in his own image Spirit man of man not a man in his own image but Man In His Image he'd made them male and female before he ever ever had a man in the dust of the Earth keep that in your thinking this man was made male and female but it's supposed to be a type of Christ in the church huh but brother Dale I've just always believed that I was eternal I don't know what part I asked a man one time when he was riding down the highway brother collie but I was there and the poor old brother I got feeling sorry for him after they got through with him because he made a few little statements and when he did it went haywire I just asked him a simple question he said oh we come with this Gene in US remember and I I you know I just asked him a simple question where was it at was it in your body was it in your spirit or was it in your soul he said I'm not going to answer you then they took it up and I shut up and really I got feeling sorry for the poor old guy because they sure done a good job of quoting brother Branham all right what you see there's a lot said about we have eternal life now remember in all I'm bringing out to you and the messages I've brought is to bring one thing eternal life is God all right look what he says going up to 2A brother well who is this Melchizedek paragraph 48 notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking was with him and in him in his thinking now if you was with him and in him why would he use the word in his thinking okay before there Ever Was An Angel star cherubim or anything else that's Eternal and if you have eternal life you always was that's to stop there that settled it we always was yeah but read the rest of it not your being here but the shape and form that the infinite God to whatever was back there was in the infinite God or was the infinite God yeah but it said we was with him and we yeah John 1 1 says what in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God but then we stopped didn't we we had two but then somebody read the rest of it and said and the Word was God so we were with him and in him in his thinking but as I started to say a while ago be careful how you're using your thinking because I don't want to be just in his thinking because everybody in the world right right foreknowledge right everybody within his thinking I want to be a part of the Thinker right right I just want to be a part of that eternal life I want to be a part of the one that was doing the thinking don't you and if I'm a Child of God deny the eternal life that I have within me was a part of that God before he ever began to even think about anything about life endurance if you have eternal life eternal life was always eternal right not our being here come on now they asked brother Brandon said were we Spirits then pull up number two which is questions and answers in 1959 628. where were we Spirits then no we were not even nothing then but in God's mind we were and he spoke it and it materialized Jesus was slain before how many knows that the Bible teaches that Jesus Christ was the lamb slain before the foundational world why God spoke it and when he spoke it it was as good as finished and when he saw me he saw you before the foundation of the world we were only figurative figurative in his mind then when he come to the world now you read them then when he come to the world we were both male and female male and female he separated the feminist Spirit from the man and made a woman out of it and left the masculine spirit in the man now may I restate you cannot use that for all mankind he's going to be a special person because the person's got to be male and female that's the only point I'm trying to make you can argue philosophy is all you want to but you've got to come back to that statement it was only a special being that could be male and female and that being would be none other than God himself well you're trying to make us God according to the Bible That's What We Are and just remember your Prophet was so strict about the way he said things so straight he said Adam was the god of the earth he says now Adam was not the god of Heaven right he made a distinction between the two because he knew we'd run it Wild let's just read a little bit on number three here is taken from the message of the identified Masterpiece of God starting off paragraph 51 and I think we've got about three or four paragraphs let us turn now our thoughts from Michelangelo to the great sculpture God almighty who in the beginning before there was a day or dawn of day for there was an atom or a molecule God in his mind had man and what a man should look like what he should be and what he should act like he wanted that man to be a part of him so he made man in his own image and in the likeness of God created he man oh when God in the beginning made this masterpiece something that reflected his thoughts remember there's only one form of eternal life an hour even our names and our thoughts were with God before there was a foundation of the world because now we possess eternal life and to do that we have to be a part of God right so we've we'd have to be as much as in his thoughts cause we have eternal life and was predestinated to this life and her names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world according to Revelations now that God had us in his thinking then we have eternal life because then he spoke us and we come into existence and a word is just a thought manifested God had us in the beginning in his thoughts now and when he made Adam that first man how perfect it was he looked like God the great Holy Spirit brooding over the Earth and he the birds come out maybe and the animals different things and he kept coming more in the form of the one that was brooding until finally there come up a specie just exactly like the one that was doing the brooding right God God would man was made in the image of God then when he placed him in his great this Garden like Michael and great Garden like Michelangelo has placed his great life's work and all the great sculptures God placed his handiwork in the Garden of Eden made him a help me mate what a complete satisfaction it was to god Till even he rested it was just at rest his work had been finished now do you believe that Eve was in Adam we have been over that enough in reading the scriptures and taking the rib and made it until even our little children ought to understand that he was in Adam but do you believe he was in Adam in that creation that for the foundation of the world there's the thought for tonight do you believe Eve was in Adam well I'll go along with it she's in his flesh well the Bible didn't say that the Bible said this man that he made was made male and female and then he gave them Dominion over everything of course now brother Dale you were not in the message because we know them women ain't nothing but old byproducts they they're a bunch of hamburger meat but we're good porterhouse steak I've fought that for 40 something years probably been called a lot of things because of doing it but I wished you would go home and look up the word byproduct have you ever looked it up I mean ask you to raise your hand but how many of you ever looked up byproduct somehow some of you smart enough you don't need to look it up but you might be dumb enough to not know what it means the Webster then to you that raised your hand you heard him say this that a byproduct is of equal value or greater no that ain't in my dictionary okay Peggy used to have the idea she got it from somewhere that somebody told her that you'd never be able to tell the difference in the summer and winter except for the shedding of the leaves and the button of the trees I said Dane in the Bible it's always going to be shedding of the leaves and butting to the trees and that is the seasons is what brings it you go overseas go over there in Jamaica and look at a tree and then stay that way all year round because it doesn't have any problems no weather conditions but you see ever tub will sit on its own bottom that's in the Bible my grandma told me that well sorry about it but grandma didn't know everything well you're throwing off with my grandma no I'm thrown off on you for believing it you ever heard the one where it's better to put you seed in the belly of a than put it in trying to make some kind of garbage can out of the Bible better do that than just spill it on the ground but they'll swear by and die by it I read that well praying it on I don't have a lot of money but I'll give you ten thousand bucks to bring those three statements to me out of the Bible because you ain't going to find it but you see we'd rather take what grandma and grandpa said brother Branham we just read said he wanted that man to be part of him so he made man in his own image into the likeness of God created He-Man male and female a creation cannot apply to all mankind it can only apply to a certain being and remember I am not that far off either just because a man and his wife becomes one that does not make them exactly like Adam and Eve right piggy wasn't in me Gail you wouldn't in brother dick could probably helped him if he would have been let's keep on reading now let's see what do you understand do you understand I'm asking the question because we got it on over here in a minute when we get down to it uh about Adam and about Eve and how that a man and woman was made one there were one they were separated one put in flesh one in theophany when he made a natural man he put him in flesh the afternoon of Eve would not put there only the feminist part not a theophany she was with him in the spiritual creation and she was part of him in the natural creation we'll get that to that a while but I want to see if what you believe you see this man of 126 and 27 then would be a special creation of and it would be male and female all right but there wasn't two people standing there you say well are you going to believe that man and his wife is a type of Christ in church I believe that but I don't believe today man and wife is one soul there too they're two people but if you're born again amen if the husband and wife is born again they only have one theophany One Soul that dwells within them which is the soul of almighty God now you explain eternal life any other way but see we've got a little problem there with Adam and Eve that we've got to consider and to to think about it see because this 126 man the part that was to be Adam went into Adam when he breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul Eve was still in the theophany and hadn't been transported down yet remember what the words you want to use so then you've got to think about something now what's the point follow it Adam and Eve was not one soul there were two people but they were one in the original soul of before the foundation of the world me and my wife both of us have eternal life by the new birth all right then by being that away that's just one soul but it's two Souls having that and it ain't the two Soul doctor okay that's a couple of souls having that get away from two Souls then think about it how many born-again Believers you think's in the world today let's give a number a million there's any problem with that or you don't cut it down a little bit because maybe you don't think it's okay A hundred thousand you want to cut down a little further ten thousand I don't care come on down to a thousand you know that are true Born Again believers you know that every one of them is one with Christ every one of them has eternal life and every one of them the soul of God came to their so being and made it eternal oh I want to get to that but I said your soul is just if you have a new birth it's just as Eternal as it'll ever be right you're not too sold out of you ever notice he's making this statement he said it's maybe he says me and God where he said either you and God together as persons that's not two people and God came in and give you eternal life sister Gail that eternal life is his soul coming to you you explain it any other way because the Bible plainly tells you he gave his own life as a ransom you remember the other day can we find a ransom for the soul take on these things see we're requiring you to think a little bit so when this as we covered Sunday now right to that part that this 126 man was put into 2 7. and we read it from Blasphemous names we're especially into Adam right came eternal life all right look what he says about this man Number Four Brothers which is Oneness 1962. paragraph 146. because we I didn't mark these for them sheep don't household see nothing had a soul has a soul but man God put he's an animal form that's true but he put a soul on him that's what made him different from the animals he node right from wrong when his soul came on him he didn't know right and wrong before then I could stop and spend a little time talking but I don't want to throw out too much but remember you're supposed to know right and wrong but it doesn't get marking against you until you reach the age of accountability right right okay see they just you think I'm trying to throw out too much I'm trying to I told my wife the other day I said honey I go in there and I said I tear that up and throw it away I turn it up and throw it away I'm trying to bring it down to where we can understand what's being said because look he's an animal form that's true but he put a soul on him that's what made him different from the animals he knowed right and wrong right from wrong when his soul came on him but he remember when God created man in his own image and then he became a living Soul see he became that knowing right from wrong you know the Bible says that a woman who lives in pleasure is what dead won't she liveth is that scripture you know that you're not a living soul now you're gonna have to swallow two parts okay baby gets life it's a living Soul it's a human being it's going but that's not the right one right when that baby gets born again then it really becomes a living soul right until then it's just like anything else a little higher than the animal but not a lot you remember what we brought out on the Blasphemous names how that brother Branham says that the Breath of Life go ahead and roll it up let's read it because I don't mind quoting again what things are said go ahead to number six now here's Jehovah Witnesses in their book it says it's a breath that you breathe it's the soul now that cannot be right the breath that you breathe is not Soul all right the breath is the wind the different things and you take the scripture they take the scripture that he breathed the breath into his nostrils and he became a living Soul running on up to save us time we went through that Sunday all right see if you've done that you'd have everybody breathe and the animals would Breathe this whole and we'd believe this whole girl can't be but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he became a living soul who into Adam right that's when he put the 126 into 2 7. right is that is that simple enough he put the 126 man the spirit man into 2 7. but you got to remember because I ain't gonna get there tonight but you got to remember that Eve was left in theophany she didn't come into flesh man to start with you got to wait till her body comes he said we're going to get become a living Soul a soul that can't die and watch we're going to get into honey plume to your to your elbows notice breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul because God breathed not what nature done now do you understand that he's simply saying God breathes into your nostrils eternal life and he's using it as a nature would this be natural life as you're living do you understand that one right now I think nature is not nature so don't fool around the trouble you mean the nature give me that no God had to give it to you what God did he breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living Soul then you say to me Adam died brother Branham but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him right now we will get back to that statement so remember it but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him Now where's that at in the Bible because Adam sinned and God branked the animal and killed it right come on we got to get between the lines and stay on the lines and run with it Adam come into the world and then he sinned and then God made an atonement as far as the natural but as far as the spiritual he was a lamb that stood slain before the foundation of the world amen he already had a lamb before his tinned he had a lamb right but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him Hallelujah because we're going to show when we get to it that Adam died you know when he died when he sinned he lived 500 something years no longer all right we've got a lot to go those who before knew he would he has caught he got a lamb to redeem them he was a type Adam failed then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of Eternal the Eternal God and he'd become a living Soul he was the son of God is that what the Bible said Adam was the son of God all right especially into Adam gonna look up especially I'm gonna come up in your computer you got to look up specially until you do that because it saves you trouble I wrote I tried he's special you know I tried that for so long until I wore out and it didn't work and I finally spelled it special when it come up okay but are you with me what about this next statements one I love because if you think it don't tie with Redemption go up to number seven brother 232 Blasphemous names number seven the church is the mystical Body of Christ borned of the Breath of God if you have a new birth today you're born by the Breath of God it gives you eternal life watch it but look how far it goes did you get it congregation said amen the Church of God is born to the Breath of God God breathes breath into the nostrils spiritually of Adam and he became a living soul did you know the Pentecostals are the true Pentecostal Church is born of the Breath of God they got another one going on to this one in a minute in case I forget it don't get it on tonight he said when that image is brought all the way up then he breathes on it and she becomes a living soul special something in there think about Eve for a minute let's see I want you to see that Eve was in that original creation that's that's what gets you when brother Branham is trying to explain that she's not in the original creation because of the fact that she was he had stopped creating and then you know she wasn't made male it wouldn't Adam made a male an evil female like the dogs and the cats and the people just run that thing so Haywire until it's silly but for one statement I wished you would read it in the Bible that he took from Adam a rib she never come out of a secondary creation she was right out of the original but not as a person at the time right then look up byproduct I don't care what you say it I mean I believe byproduct means something that's worth a Bad Thing something down below well you ain't gonna believe it anyway so forget it go buy your product I told you I don't like jokes well what do you think about Eve let's read what your Prophet had to say go to number 10 questions and answers on Hebrews number three since 57. 1006. now God in the beginning when he knowed man and woman was made one not two they were made one they were separated one put in flesh and one in with theophany so they got the same theophany we'll get that in a minute now don't try to make a soul let you onto a soul so much because we've got to define something real close all right he knew that so in order to prove that to you when God made the woman he never took some dust and made her like he did the man no she's just a byproduct he thought so much of her until she was not created like the other animals were created we don't hear that do you no it's just a byproduct right she can't even be circumcised she's not in the Kingdom without a head I thought by the new Earth Christ with her head yeah but he took a rib out of his side and she become a byproduct of a man because she's part of him you get it now she's part of him but look when he was put in flesh one put in flesh one in a theophany look at the next one question is answered on Hebrews 3 but it's going on to paragraph 8 26. and as he walked through the Garden of Eden first is theophany like the holy spirit is in here now walking in here it led the animal life and it controlled everything but it couldn't till the soil so we put man so he put him in flesh so that he could till the soil give him his five senses to till the soil and fix up in The Vineyards and so forth and then the man still looked Lonesome oh this is a beautiful picture look for when he was first made he was made two people together now you can't put that between me and Peggy and the natural life now right right I don't care how much you think I got my wife well a lot of them got what what was it on Wiki uh Gallant married about seven different men I ain't gonna call the name gonna be on tape but y'all did okay well that won't work too good but well she gonna be in heaven I don't think he's going to get tired but that's all right God look for when he was first made he was made to people made two people together he was made both male and female the man was the Bible said he was God made man both male and female created he him notice now when man was separated from the theophany and put in flesh he was he wasn't just all together there part of his being was still in a theophany so it didn't look right well something lacking in Adam wouldn't it Adam was lonesome something lacking in Adam go ahead let's see Adam was lonesome was going to 29. okay she was part of him look at this one never went and got dirt and made Eve but he made from the original dirt that made it from Adams here and he took a rib from his side and made him a helpmate and that was Eve she was made for the man and part of the man before I get onto that other I know people might want to make me a smarter like I'm not correcting brother Branham but the Bible does not say help mate the Bible says help meet read your Bible Genesis give him a help meet mate can be two men right meat means part of you man and wife is one okay yeah I'm smarter like all right but look she was made for the man and part of the man she was part of him in the beginning in the creation in the theophany she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided in another creation she had to be made in the same creation that's exactly why Christ and God had to be the very same person couldn't be too had to be the same person right are you with me he was lonesome took a rib from this man Adam made a body stood the body there with Adam in any place to 126 into Eve now remember Adam never had a name under the 126 man there's no name mentioned remember Eve never had a name until she fell because Eve means the mother of all living and at the time she was there she wasn't the mother of anything when she was there in Adam what do you understand Adam and Eve the only time that could ever happen was placed like that you want to stay all night and let me talk about where brother random said and we will get back to it where brother random said that Jesus come here with us in him he said I walked ashore to Galilee in him but you know what they'd rather do and rejoice about it everybody wants to Rejoice to think not that that we come here in Jesus they want to think that Jesus come here in them because that's all that eternals and predestinations deal now just remember Eve was in Adam and if there's any part about you and I that was in Christ it would have to be part of the eternal life because we were not little bitty peoples running around in the body of Christ we ought to be dumb and I mean smart enough to figure that one out and not dumb enough to swallow it what are you following me now here's Adam he's made and God breathed into his nostrils and he become a living soul here's Eve she's made God breathed into her nostrils she become a living soul now I don't mind even stating it to you because somebody's going to come up with it anyway so I'll beat you to it brother Branham never talked about God breathing into Eve No statement foreign what are you doing I'm reading between the lines well that's your reading okay what's yours I don't mind doing it that way I'll listen to you but you see where our problem is is not thinking about that Adam had to have a human soul to be Adam if you put the spirit in the soul of God into flesh without bringing a name or titles to it or something wait you've got God it's all right because Adam was but still get my point that man Adam brother Branham State and I've got it right in here he said there he stood with his feet in the earth dead I don't mind giving you both oppositional sides because I want you to think but I want you to think about sensible time Body Spirit and soul makes a man right So Adam was Body Spirit and soul standing there and God placed eternal life into the soul of Adam and he became a living being Eve was taken from Adam but around said the feminist part was taken from Adam and placed into a body and she was given made a living Soul now or either she's still dead some if that's not true and remember my point is if Adam came from theophany to flesh and Eve was still in theophany then when that was put in flesh Adam and Eve both had eternal life there's a type of Christ in the church not every man and woman is in the world mm-hmm you can't top every man and woman in the world as a type of Christ in the church you got to bring it to the right place so I'm telling you what I believe Adam was Body Spirit and soul and then God breathed into his nostrils eternal life and there's Adam the son of God if you don't believe that Soul then how does it do with Jesus when he came but that's all right Eve then was taken from Adam and the part that she would have been in the original with Adam in theophany was placed into Eve and she became a living Camus living soul eternal life in the original Power that started it eternal life me and what are you and I look at number 14. taken from adoption number two 1965-18 now but he wanted to put things in time he had to make something to worship so his attributes produce this then he made the man you said well the Angels worshiped him that ain't the kind of worship God wants I'm sorry our smartness runs us into the ground to miss the rest of the story Angels worshiping and just makes him God man worships him makes him father over his children okay he had to make something to worship so his attributes produce this then he made the man then in this man he looked along some so now to show now his great mind what he had in picture of the Christ and the church now are you with me I've been stating that over and over and over but now we read it he took not a different piece of clay and made a woman but he took from the side of Adam a rib and took from the spirit of Adam the feminist and put it in this rib what about it pull up number 15 we'll read this and then we'll quit because I only want to read the bottom part we read the first part Bring It On It 236. um come on there you go 235 Church mourned on the Breath of God this is taken from blasphemy missed names right down below where we were reading while ago Church born to the Breath of God when this stature has molded itself up there in condition God's breathe breath breathe upon them receive ye the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God and look at what brother random would say you can join anything you want to now is he telling you when you come up in the Statue of a perfect man to The Headstone you can join in church you want to if it is but you're blind as a bat come on up a little close to where you can read what's he saying he said you can join anything you want to but you're born into the Church of the Living God born by the Breath of God God breathed upon them and said receive ye who eat the Holy Ghost oh my there you are and you remember in the Bible you know that he preached upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost six months before Pentecost right nobody's giving you six months I don't really know okay but before then okay but what was your prophet's answer to that he said they said did they get the Holy Ghost right then he said no that was only a promise see because Jesus Christ hadn't died right when this pyramid is finished and the bride of Christ as a whole then he can breathe upon her it's a promise right now but what a promise but one day it won't be a promise you say one day I'm not making it out in the future and I'm not making it out in the past I'm making it ever when he takes care of it when he adopts the church fully I believe he adopts individuals into the body of Christ I've had a lot of people argue with me and fuss like crazy and he'll say brother Dale when a man is adopted he cannot die I said well brother Branham did and Lord Jesus did so now you go argue all your points you say you can't die when you adopted brother Branham did well well he had to go that's okay that's not the point the point is he did you see one day death is going to be destroyed and then the bride of Christ won't have to die death will be destroyed one day in you and I come on you musicians What About Eve Eve was a part of God a part of Adam in the original and Adam was a part of God so Eve was a part of God to Eternal part she's placed in the flesh God breathed into her nostrils and she become a living soul yeah but stand out because look what he's done poor ignoramus is there anything is a big sin or a little sin foreign such thing as a big sin or a little sin well then the least thing that we could do would be enough to annihilate us right but yet you're a born-again Christian brother Dale I don't sin your Prophet said he did every day now but I I I can't see it that's right the Inside Man Of You little John says it that seed cannot sin inside of you can't sin if you're a born-again Christian but these outside body he's got a lot of problems right and we'll be according to your Prophet a sticker as long as we live well you don't think we're going to get better and better and better I've been watching for 40 years trying to find some better and I ain't found no better and you ain't found no better than me may I quote brother Brandon from the tape last night the priest in 1961 he said the Azusa Street people now it's paraphrasing but it's very close he said azusa's treat people had more of God working among them than we do now he said because they didn't have anything they just had to go on what they hadn't believe God let's quote all he said let's talk about all he said that way we won't have to fool around with wondering what this is and that is you see those people back there had to believe God and had to search for sometimes for food to eat you think down to the Dark Ages when they were being killed just for believing they were Christians you know we get our feelings hurt because somebody don't shake our hey yeah he didn't speak to me let's stand but Eve was a part of Adam both spiritually speaking and physically speaking but then there was never any other man that away until the Lord Jesus came he was not a man to the Old Testament whatever brought forth as male and female can't be but when Jesus Christ came he came with us in him and we are the bride so he came male and female not a morphodite now don't be stupid he came here with us in him the part of eternal life that he was why can't you read what brother Randall says and think but common sense when he says a part of God went out and he says it's not like an arm Fallen offer that's doing it he said it's the part of God he says it's hard to explain which is God in another form Adam and Eve was God in another form and that never happened again until the real one came then he made a way for you and I to come to Salvation and that Christ in this church could stand up on Earth Christ and his pride not a male and female Holy Ghost that's stupidity if one Holy Ghost one eternal life the one brings a form of the man the other brings a form of the female to be Christ in the church what we got 596 I feel the poles anybody have a need the altar is open and I begin to cry and my mind just fails to know exactly why I can't explain we're tongue or been the spirits Within it must be God here in my soul cause I feel the poor feel the Satan's fighting he's fighting Wade over there I'm sure overseas aren't doing but then he jumps on the dunes need to try to run everything else messing it all up but you know what let's just believe and say all is well no matter what all is well he laid on brother Al's heart to think about that so let's take that as God and just believe all is well father Lord in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ thank you for putting it on our brother's heart about Wade in June and how Satan's fighting on every hand and Lord we know who's going to take care of everything because all is well we thank you Father we love you and we just commit everything into your hands and reach down to June Lord take away that old blood pressure problem yes Lord father thank you people to wait and take care of him we love you and we thank you Father thank you for loving us from Curry Farms thank you for putting it on our brother's heart about this Lord we believe that's you working through the body of Christ so we believe you father in Jesus name let's please father our little buddies got sinus problems that's bothering me they've bothered him a long time but they bothered him enough in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our little buddy we believe you father and to say that by your stripes he's healed and we thank you in Jesus anybody else I lay in bed and I I begin to cry you ever do that let everything be taken care of I believe you father we believe all is well no matter what Satan does he can't conquer the Bride of Jesus Christ we ask you to just make manifest the Lord show our brother did all is well thank you Father all is well all is well knows each here is why because God says it is to me and I agree Lord please come and take control I feel do you feel that pool there's a pool in the last days trying to pull us to the right place in the word to bring us to that position to understand the prophet said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for Satan to be powerless before well why can't we just believe it I've never tried to tell you anything about where I am in God because I think that is uh beside the point it wouldn't help you if you believe me to be God himself standing in human flesh that wouldn't help you right it's trying to get you to believe that you're God in human flesh and then you can realize that Satan can't conquer you he don't understand it yeah but you people you think you're a God and look at it oh look at all that one okay just hang around oh boy things are going to work and are working that's my point my part my fighting has been one thing as we say oh look what was back there and look what's over here but we're not seeing what's here well if ain't something here it wasn't back there and it never will be over there all right so why don't we believe what's going on now and to say Thank you Lord yes thank you Lord we appreciate it Lord Jesus all we've tried to do is get your people to see about you Lord because if we can see you and see where you're at then we don't have no problems all is well no matter how bad things get in our lives how horrible they become all is well when things go all wrong it's for our benefit to try to bring us to a place to understand who we are and how then that we can take control of these things by faith in you Lord and cast that demon away Bless the people on the way home give everybody a safe journey we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you dismissed all ye Saints of Life Proclaim Jesus the light of the world life and mercy in his name Jesus the lighter we'll walk in the light Beautiful Life come when you do drops of mercy of bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world is called
