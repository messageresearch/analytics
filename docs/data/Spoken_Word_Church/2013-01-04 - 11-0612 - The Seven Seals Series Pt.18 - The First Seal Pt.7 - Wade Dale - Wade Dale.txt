========================================

all right good morning everyone good to be back trying to get this thing started good to be all right okay we got burley's camp coming up in another maybe five or six weeks so we need to start getting their ducks in a row for it and for those of you that are going camping this weekend with the brothers we need to meet after a second service somewhere when all these women get out of here praise the lord when they all get out of here we'll have a meeting about what we need to get and bring and why did you tell them where to put them what would you put the sign she said that's already uh let's turn revelation 6 and get started yeah life sounds like a mountain biker i am a whole bunch of airplanes they don't want that sign so whatever we want to do with it dick does not want that sign so whatever we want to do with it yeah these signs are vinyl both to last over 10 years or 10 years guaranteed 10 years no fading or peeling or cracking we'll say i hope we don't have to find out 10 years from now all right revelation six verse one all right where's sadie what's remember susie's name all right now we spoke last wednesday on the part of iniquity where we were going through the buddha seal food seal number one gotta gonna kind of recap a little this morning uh i want you to start reading the second seal the first seal is showing the mystery of iniquity or the man of sin but the whole point of the first seal to me is if we don't have a true revelation of one god then the first seal will not break because without that first seal i was preaching out in oklahoma this past weekend and they kind of got the idea that i said the first seal was the very most important one well we all know the seventh seal the important one the most important because it's christ right without him being on the scene the first seal won't open but without the first seal opening the second seal would have opened right what brother brown said he said i don't know what that second seal is but once that first seal opened to that prophet it was easier for him to say hey i'm not going on my notes anymore because i was fixing to go on my note my old notes my old notes were that the white horse rider was the holy ghost and then he would have preached that man all the way through the fourth seal as the holy ghost does everybody understand that okay so very important that first seal was so important that god let that prophet come right to a you know like the day before at 12 o'clock or the day of at 12 o'clock he said he said i've made a horrible mistake if the if the angel of the lord had to come in the room at 12 o'clock and straightened me out on this well from 12 o'clock when they had the service that was getting pretty close so i'm sure he had to tear all those notes up and start over again and the lord just started revealing things to him showing the i don't like and i know the bible says it revealed the wicked one but i don't like to reveal the devil because if you'll reveal jesus christ satan will be exposed we want to expose that man right we want to and truly reveal means to make known plus it will do that it will make that there's two things going to be made known in the end town christ and the antichrist no in between no you know you know let's just get down to brass tacks that's all that matters this man the the antichrist has been so close to jesus christ until he's almost deceived the very elect he's basically let's just be honest those people that baptized in father son holy ghost baptism god was winking at their ignorance and allowing that to happen but now god don't change his mind about his word matthew 20 whatever that matthew um whatever it is 22 or 24 or 27 therefore he says baptize in the name of the father and of the son of the holy god did god change his mind and say father son holy ghost is it no man changed his mind and he allowed satan so close he didn't accept that but he allowed it brother said god winked at our ignorance the ignorance of the people in the pulpit right right because god reveals it to the minister first whether you like it or not that's right he revealed it to the minister first and then you get it he gets the big loaf like jesus did on the there on the shores of galilee he got the big loaf and then he started tearing off loaves and handing loaves to the people he did not handle those to the people he handed the loaves to the twelve that's right and they distribute it to the people and one of them was the devil god always remember judas was there that's right he handed out the bread the same bread that jesus broke he handed it out so you got to be careful of that man of sin that's why that man of sin was so deceptive he was sitting right there so close until he was almost ready to deceive a prophet but you can't deceive a prophet you can you can keep you can be in deception but somewhere it's going to be made known because god's got a perfect will his perfect will was father son holy ghost baptism is not right three gods or trinity of doctrine is not right all right so somewhere somehow that got eat down and we we were talking about it by the cloud now and then not seeing council in there that's that's where it really happened because you had the faith of the fathers you had first three ages the the first three ages parallels were the first seal right first seal in the first three ages we'll wrap that up probably next sunday but the first seal parallels the first three ages all right or compares with the first three ages because that was the lion spirit l-i-o-n lion that went out the bowl paul peter james and john all those that wrote the bible all those that were in the early church did not have a father-son holy ghost baptism to deal with they didn't have three gods to deal with they believed in one true living god they believed in water baptism in that lord jesus christ but 606 it's kind of ironic that that was when the last night seeing council was in 606 a.d and that's when the third church ended according to brother brown of course we know there's a lap over but brother do you look in your church age book 606 a.d is when the third age ended what happened in 606 a.d they took on the father son holy ghost baptism and jesus being a like substance of god not the substance of god so therefore they set up the trinity they start to worship the virgin mary and all those things see all that evolved remember god doesn't just dump everything on you and satan doesn't either he's wise so he started in that in that first three ages he he started as a saint well is was that man jesus or was he the same was he god or was he just like god or did god send the son satan got into the ministers of the hour right brother brown said true prophets went to nicaea he said they should have stayed away from it but they went to nicaea and to make a long story short they got sucked in on some of the doctrine and when they got sucked in on some of the doctrine they started going well so saying if he ever puts a question in your mind see then you start dealing with that question that's right and then he goes over here and gets in this other brother and his other brother when you get he see remember power was given he got straight from what to people the people started their little saying remember it was a saying a d doctrine it goes all the way up we'll get into that in a little while but at that 606 council you got constantine you got all these people that come in you got you got a pope actually that doctrine became crowned remember they put you can't put a crown on the spirit it says the crown was given what a crown was given to a flesh person satan started his ride just like god started his ride through jesus christ the holy one of israel one only one of israel all right and then satan started his ride because we read a couple of sundays ago paul said grievous wolves will come in now and not spare the flop but remember what paul said and we read this that in oklahoma they never really read it that way paul said and even in my congregation in other words right even in my congregation it's where it's going to be and he said in yourselves in other words you're the one that's going to do it grievous wolves are not only going to just come in it's going to start among you and then john which went to the isle of patmos after paul was killed john goes to the isle of patmos comes back and he sees that man of sin that person standing there with a triple crown on his head the pope and read in the bible he said let's see if we can find that revelations 18 i think it is something there john admired verse 6 chapter 17 verse 6. now this is john the revelator remember the sermon i preached not too long ago how long was he born again 60 years this man was a sage he was a prophet not a prophet like an end like a a church age prophet but he was the prophet because the word of the lord came to it he was a prophet john was on the isle of patmos to write everything down that he saw he'd been born again for 60 years he was at the faith of the fathers he was up there had all those virtues working in his life wow pretty good guy huh didn't have a father-son holy ghost baptism to deal with satan couldn't fight him on that he didn't have a three gods to deal with he didn't fight him on that but listen to what he said right here verse six and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration the original is wonder and you can go all the way so if you admire something you've almost fell into lust great admiration donnie and i go to the bass pro shop we see this 3 000 dollar over and under shotgun that just fits us perfect we're not only admiring it we're wanting it you understand one thing we're not only admiring it we're wanting it now john didn't because he was born again he didn't want it but look how close this thing was john i believe john in his own person this i'm just you know throwing this out john with his own in his own mind he said how can this be so evil and be so beautiful she looks good yeah sure but he saw all this i remember what he wrote down you read verse one two three four five man by the time we get to number five down here if you'll read that we'll know on this side on this side of that writing that she was a horn she was the most vile creature on the face of the earth she had destroyed saints by the billions and john's still admired because she was beautiful he said i'm sure i'm sure john said in his human self he said how can that be so evil be so beautiful and be so evil but that was the white horse rider writing he was right there on isle of patmos come on the devil wasn't boy the devil didn't leave john alone i don't think he don't leave me and you alone doesn't he he'll leave john alone he's playing with john's mind but john knew with the holy spirit we've got to know john you by the holy spirit what he was pinning was right whether or how he felt see because the man of sin is is full of lust and all these things iniquity and all that what is that that deals with this fleshly thing it deals with the flesh john admired it because his his senses looked at that woman and said how can this woman be so beautiful and be so evil but it was but man you read the rest of that i mean she's got uh um she's got was like i said the blood of all the saints see john had to be thinking because remember he was the only one he was the only one that was alive that he knew of john i mean uh paul had been killed he knew that peter had been killed hung upside down on the cross james had been run through with a spear matthew and bartholomew some of them went to um uh one of them went to india and they drug him through the streets and killed him see john knew all these things he knew the blood of those martyrs those saints was in that woman's hand but yet he still admired it you see how close this is that's like we were talking about this weekend it's going to be just a little small group of people that's going to really understand what this woman is saying man of sin of course she's portrayed as a woman because she's a church but it's satan behind them doing the work all right all right let's read that 7 and the angel said unto me wherefore didest thou marvel i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrying her which has seven heads and ten horns and then he shows that what is that that's all the beast coming up all the powers the beast that that sauce was and it is not shove his hand out of the bottom of his bed and go into perdition then it keeps on going to verse nine the seven heads are seven mountains which the woman sitted now there's only two places in the world that there's seven hills and roamed one of them so he was talking about the pokemon are there not just rome the physical city it's not just it's not just rome italy is evil gangs where georgia's not evil the city it's the people in the city that's evil okay are good you know our good good our evil but back to this he admired this great person this great woman this great church he admired him so but that great church at that time said here is 1896 by 80 by 303 or somewhere in there when they had the person i see in council watch what had happened satan had got in and started putting little sayings you couldn't see this man of sin he was just working as a spirit the prophet said because you can't crown a spirit but he had to start working somewhere in baby form he was working through the people but then in 606 after the third age ended and you started into the fourth age which was what your red horse there was a man standing there that they could put a crown on and say this is the biker instead of god see so that spirit had become something that they could crown now let's go back to revelation 6. and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals i heard as were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see now that was the lion l i owe him and i saw him behold a wild horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went for conquering and to conquer all right that seal ends there conquering in the conqueror but remember one is just a step for the next one all right one seal makes a step for the next one to open up all right so this one ended with finally they got a man standing there a man robed crown power he went forth conquering and to conquer you'll read back in the old time the reason they did the killing in the fourth age was because of what happened in that third age when they had that council in 606 they said hey this is law we're going to start worshiping mary we're going to start doing novenias we're going to start doing this we're going to start praying to dead saints all this evolves from that we see it now we go that's so stupid but remember in 606 a.d the people were ignorant to certain things they didn't have television and cds and dvds and and message preachers they did have their message preachers but they were local assemblies and they couldn't get tied together what is satan's greatest greatest greatest way to get you and i away from god when the pope comes out this ain't victory to the pope this is divide and conquer he went forth conquering and to conquer in other words he started dividing the people into denominations ideas that's that's satan's greatest brother branham said oh if the bride could come together under one thought one you were not going to have the same thought but you know this is to me this is the thought the message of the hour is the thoughts of god right that was the pure thoughts of god all that father son holy ghost and all that three gods and all that mary and worship and all that stuff that's not god god allowed that to happen and actually work through that john wesley was father from holy ghost baptism martin luther you know come out of the catholic church franklin and all that stuff but he went back to the to the basis of the bible that the just shall live by faith not by not by praying to mary not by just like dad was talking about and the people in the message it kind of flips their brain because brother brown says wesley started restoration i mean i'm sorry reformation he was a reformer that's why they say lutheran won't make it and wesley won't make it because they were reformers they were reformers but the message they brought was restoring the faith back to where it used to be so it was doing a work of restoration in reformation did everybody understand that he made that comment wednesday night i hope everybody understood that he's not contrary to the prophet now i'm not conquering the prophet the prophet said they started a reformation what they started reforming the people right but god inside that started a work of restoration because the holy ghost can't be reformed right the holy ghost only restores right he don't reform nothing that's alcoholics anonymous that's trying to do good that's why wesley said don't drink tea it has no value so they quit drinking tea well see he was in a little bit in the flesh but the holy ghost inside of him was teaching clean your life up but wesley didn't catch the whole revelation everybody understand my little illustration i'll tell you again this is you know god god winks in our ignorance right what does winking do it turns one eye when you wink at something you can't see over here god winked at our ignorance because god started in the days of luther and this is all that man could see this is all the light that man could see see i can do this and all i see is brother tim when he was really happy with martin luther and joe show that my faith but that didn't mean that this room wasn't here see that didn't mean that god's word was already in works but right here is all we can see now what if we broaden the revelation oh now i see brent anderson i see whatever her name is can't remember it now but i see three people now now were they sitting there when i was doing this yes but if i walked in the room and only could see that i'd say well that's only one person the just shall live by faith you understand what i'm saying there was more revelation you know the word don't pass away right all right but now i can see with a little more light i can see three people we'll see in the end time guess what happened brother said the book is open right see they was only reading pages of the book now the book is open see now everything's in full view it didn't it didn't do away with with all you sitting over here you were already sitting here but i could only see brother tim but now that i see brother tim and brother anderson and his wife that don't mean his sister whatever her name is no that's regina yeah sister regina that i've only known for a few minutes so that's okay but that doesn't mean that she's not sitting there but see my revelation only shows this it's a very simple explanation but it explains why people in the message go cuckoo and say well brother graham said luther didn't have anything no no luther had what what luther had was what he saw right there didn't do away with all this but right here was what god was pleased with and what man could see during that time then john wesley was a little deeper revelation he could see more of the word didn't do away with all this but when the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost in our age in our age not back then in our age you know in 1906 to do the street it made it a little bit bigger right then when brother brown comes he had to type all the loose ends well where was the loose ends the loose ends were over here y'all are about to loosen but when he tied the loose knives together see that brought god's whole vision back together again all right then he started preaching the seals to get us out of here see that didn't just get a revelation of back to the to paul and peter's day that didn't do them any good as far as changing their body that's why brother brown said the messenger of malachi 4 do two things two parts number one he's going to restore everything back to where paul peter and all them preached in the first three ages everybody understand that right you understand that that's what he come to do the first part the healing ministry was to catch the people's attention and then he started bringing the people back to him lord jesus christ one god what happened in the garden all of our basic uh beliefs and it's not our idea it's a total belief that we believe those things and then in 1963 he went out to arizona met the angels got the message and he said you know i was telling them this weekend brother branham was standing in that first seal second seal read the seal book he didn't pray for anybody right he answered their questions on between the six and the seventh seal he answered their questions he had questions and answered he seemed like he was he was not as excited as he was back in the early age everybody you know he's just he's bringing a message but what did he say about the second or third or fourth seal he said i have never in my life worked in this realm and he seemed dead ray sick healed bulls go lay down all these things storm spoken and all these things he saw all that he said i am working in a realm this week that i have never worked in my entire life what had done he had went up a level and he didn't say the bible became a brand new chapter right he said it became a brand new book the book became open to him and he saw why the serpent's evil was right he said what yeah he says what he said he said because the revelation uh revealed in the seals he said i say unto you go and you know stay as you are don't do this no more and imagine divorce problems and all the things like that well he didn't preach marriage and divorce in the seal did he he hardly made mention of it but because of revelation of opening of the seal showing the man of sin showing the antichrist showing jesus christ he had a better understanding why there was american divorce problems why there was a way out because to me the seals show grace because without those seals you and i are going to go by the grave we're going to die and just have to wait on the right depend on the resurrection okay and we do same spirit that raised up jesus from the dead if he lives in you he'll look in your mortal body one day and you'll rise up out of the ground but there's a group of people that god said through paul we there's one of these little words again remember i always tell you if it's a little word but it's very powerful if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you right right paul said we which are alive and remain if paul had never said that there wouldn't have been a there wouldn't have been a scripture we could fall back to because see even jesus died himself the only scripture we have is as paul said we which are alive and remain we that's a little word but it's going to cover a group of people we which are alive and remain see jesus couldn't even say that he said all power in heaven earth's been given unto me this was after he got his glorified body but see once he got his glorified body you and i were in there we have now the ability the ability we now have the ability to become just where he was standing when he said all power in heaven has been given unto men his body was changed he still could eat he could disappear he hung around 30 40 days just like we're going to after our body change but paul said we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep or they go on that's all that's all brother tom's doing he's resting right he's finally got his body to rest if you look at many people and it's just to close and we'll start next sunday if you ever noticed and sister janice wilson was telling us a couple weeks ago when we were up there you know she does hair of the people that pass away the the funeral home will call him safe would you come up and you know fix the hair of the deceased well she said i've seen them in every form of you know they're very dignified they don't have they just land on them on a form and their hair she fixes their hair and stuff and does their nail and but she asked the uh undertaker she said do you see a difference in people dying that have died that are christians or so-called you know i mean people there at peace there's going to be people be given eternal life they're either good and preaching people i just believe that okay they've never been shown the gospel how the world are they gonna know the gospel that we know if we don't tell them brother brown said it's our fault because they died that way our fault okay but she said do you tell the difference he said oh sure he said yep didn't you said yes absolutely did some people come in with the most horrible look on their face and he said we pretty much know those people you know die drunk or you know whatever and they have a real hard look on their face when they pass but a christian's face is just so relaxed why we're going to sleep that's right right and let's just be honest the last time i saw brother tom he looked all bent over and of course he talked to me but you know he but he looked at peace in that casket why all the worry lines were gone out of his face all the worry of life was gone everything was relaxed well that man was sleeping waiting on you and i to get through this and do one thing and that's believe that it's for you i want us to focus on that i don't want this to be a sunday school class that i'm teaching i want you to believe what's being taught i want you to believe and that's the bible says by your words you shall be justified and by your words you'll be condemned that's real simple but that's real profound if you believe if it's for you if not you'll go by the grave which is not horrible but i'd like to be able to see this thing change right and and be changed in the morning until i'm going tonight and get out of here right that way our is over here we know we're at rest as christians but we still have heartaches and trials kids family work job situations that we all go through and that's what gives us worry lines on our face really to me that's why wrinkles come and you worry a lot people worry you know you uh y'all can tell when i have a headache right because my eyes start squinching over like this look see that's traits of satan of the fall of what he's doing to this human body and this human body is not going to change just because we read the field and because we really understand them you got to believe them you got to believe that those that that message from 1963 to 65 which is the whole message 47-63 don't kick out the first part because without 47 to 63 you have no foundation because see look i'm going to show you one thing turn that camera around before we go i haven't made this statement but i'm gonna make it now you can turn it around here for everybody to see if you're born again with the faith of the fathers this is not your foundation remember paul said leaving the principle leaving the principle this is our foundation right here that's right now i'm talking about any end time people that are believing that are born again and have the virtues working in their life let me be plain about that the people that are born again have the virgins working in their life this is our foundation right here because this is the countdown this is the seal this is the love this is what we're working on right now okay i know this is all part of it and this is part that we still got to deal with but leaving the principles of the doctrine of the cl of christ let's go on to perfection perfection is right here well these seals are a foundation not down here because they don't have this down here you're not under fantasy and let me be a little bit more plain without these virtues working in your life you're really not going to fancy it right but brother brown didn't preach him in 1947 he didn't preach him in 1959 he preached in 1963 when he had come to an adoptional stage where god had come down and identified himself with that man and not just was pleased to dwell in him he said here's him if you're gonna get it this is where you're gonna get it from right here so if we're short which we all are and don't get like i said the other night don't get caught up with these lines they're just a marker there because because if you could write it you put virtue knowledge patience godliness brotherly kindness you put them i put them all like this well that's where it's going to right here okay all right we need a foundation but we got to get off that thing you know we could lay a foundation of this building back in 1971 when we started if we built this thing from scratch and we're standing on this right now on this foundation now if we'd never built the building from 1971 to 2011 we wouldn't have church we'd be a bunch of dummies oh we got a church we got a perfect place to worship you only got a slap what did we do we started building a building on that foundation but now did we come back down here and start building again no no paul said leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let's go on to perfection so it's up here and these spheres now that we're living in these in this time something happened son i got so weak creature i couldn't stand it i had to sit down somebody got something in the service thing about it in oklahoma i never felt that way before last year i couldn't get up i just flopped out in the seat after finish preaching i said god kill somebody save somebody and the spirit lord fell out of that place claude got to preaching he got the breathing he said he wanted to shut up but it was something that not happened in a long time and i think god's moving he's moving among us he's trying our faith because he lets you go a long time and you feel like you are absolutely in the desert eating sand and cactus of the house that's it brother there's two things that we got to deal with and i dealt with one of them last sunday and brother claude got a lot out of and he said he was going to preach someone but faith and love are two things that you and i need to really look at right faith and love they go together but they're separate you've got to have faith before you have love you can't have love without faith but you have faith without love because you'd be born to pyramid and not have that love of god now i'm not talking about just hugging your brother and sister and saying i love you no i'm talking about the love of god that'll drop down from right here to right here but if we get it right here if you're born again and you open yourself up to god and not the devil he'll drop it from here to here you can't do that right this is the human part lisa that you can't you can't you can't just grab this and stick it in here no god you have to open up that channel and then god's obligated he's not just going to think he's going to do it by faith he promised you he'd do it he promised you he'd go from here to here and it's just a straight shot drake's not right now you don't have to go through it it's a straight shot okay quick i'm getting preaching i couldn't listen to brother wilson this week i know now what for the grant that when he said you can love god no no when you got that load right there there's no way you'll be lost there's no way you cannot make it right okay all right we'll see you next time you
