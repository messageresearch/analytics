[35:36] love said my people will need me and I
[35:40] will send them a
[35:42] message to straighten out the
[35:45] difficulties because the times truly
[35:47] will wax worse and
[35:49] worse God would send a message by a
[35:52] prophet that Prophet would get people
[35:54] back to the center of the word of God
[35:57] that message would prepare people for a
[36:00] Rapture because the times were going to
[36:02] get
[36:03] horrible before the message I didn't
[36:06] even know what love was Sir and now we
[36:09] know what love is we are also learning
[36:12] what true evil is where the world is
[36:15] getting so
[36:16] evil that everything good will be
[36:19] speaking evil against and everything bad
[36:22] will be justified and spoken well about
[36:25] we're in the days of the end time
[36:28] message amen we should not be
[36:31] surprised it would come in so sneaky so
[36:34] horrible to try to destroy the very work
[36:37] of
[36:39] God hold tight to the word of God this
[36:43] is our hour this is the time when we
[36:46] stand this is the time when we uh
[36:49] display Jesus Christ in Hearts amen and
[36:53] the times will grow worse yes and some
[36:55] of us maybe here even
[36:58] right will be arrested for this
[37:02] word we're already scorned we're already
[37:05] set aside like we are odd but it's the
[37:08] days of the message amen God would send
[37:11] a messenger a prophet yes sir God would
[37:15] also
[37:16] send a five-fold Ministry for the
[37:19] finishing work of the prophet's
[37:22] message God would also send sermons and
[37:26] make sure that they were taped yes the
[37:28] same God who sent a Bible and made sure
[37:31] it was in printed
[37:32] form and then he would have a people
[37:35] that would live those words that would
[37:38] live the written and the spoken
[37:40] word I believe this
[37:43] message I did not learn this message

[1:14:11] in now what if what what if what if that
[1:14:14] last one was here hallelujah in this

[1:14:22] my perspective and and my uh in Iration
[1:14:25] my motivation for doing what I do in
[1:14:27] Christ is to find that last
[1:14:31] one you know the prophet talked about
[1:14:33] how uh that if there was only one in
[1:14:36] Jeffersonville going it was going to be
[1:14:38] him huh so I just borrowed that
[1:14:40] inspiration and carried it over into
[1:14:43] looking for that last one if the last
[1:14:45] one is going to be
[1:14:46] found guess who's going to find that
[1:14:48] last one amen so I may not be called

[1:15:13] fat white black yellow whatever you are
[1:15:17] in this
[1:15:19] realm your calling is to be a light and
[1:15:22] a witness sir amen
[1:15:27] St John 4:
[1:15:29] 7 simply
[1:15:32] reads there cometh a woman of Samaria to
[1:15:35] draw water Jesus said unto her give me
[1:15:39] to drink right verse 29 verse 28
[1:15:43] actually the woman then left her water
[1:15:46] pot and went her way into the City and

[1:15:52] told me all things that ever I did is
[1:15:55] not this the Christ amen let us bow our
[1:16:00] heads Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:16:04] our place in the building today amen we
[1:16:08] thank you for a calling Upon Our Lives
[1:16:11] and when we hear that word Lord we
[1:16:14] immediately think of the ministry the
[1:16:16] calling but Lord we've all been called
[1:16:19] into this walk we've all been called
[1:16:21] into this way and sure there are
[1:16:22] different offices and different uh uh
[1:16:25] obligations and and callings
[1:16:27] respectfully and and particularly but in
[1:16:30] in the general sense of or in the broad
[1:16:32] sense of Father we've all been called
[1:16:35] and so we thank you for calling us into
[1:16:38] this place this church this building
[1:16:41] this Tabernacle this Sanctuary that that
[1:16:43] was dedicated for the indwelling of your
[1:16:47] presence and this place that was
[1:16:49] dedicated this place that was built Lord
[1:16:52] brick and mortar and and and all the
[1:16:54] things the wood and the timber all of
[1:16:56] these things that go the shingles all
[1:16:57] these things that go into construction
[1:17:00] Lord it was all for the Saints to be
[1:17:04] able to have a place to bring their lick
[1:17:06] of
[1:17:07] fire in order that that lick of fire can
[1:17:10] start a bigger fire so Lord that's why
[1:17:13] we're here today oh God to assemble in
[1:17:15] this place to to do our part to to say
[1:17:18] an amen to clap our hands to to to to
[1:17:21] give you praise to give you glory to
[1:17:23] show forth to Dying World that you are
[1:17:26] still alive and that you are still doing
[1:17:29] if you raised from the dead if you Rose
[1:17:32] like you said that you would and we know
[1:17:34] that you did then you will be continuing
[1:17:36] to do what you have always done so
[1:17:39] therefore there has to be somebody to
[1:17:42] get a hold of that understanding to get
[1:17:44] a hold of that reality and make it
[1:17:48] live until you return until you come
[1:17:51] back for us so father we're gathered
[1:17:53] here our place in the building our licks
[1:17:55] of fire and we're here to raise hands
[1:17:57] we're here to worship you and we're here
[1:17:59] to say sick him sick that old devil and
[1:18:02] and run him out of our Lives we're here
[1:18:04] to see chains are broken today yes we're
[1:18:07] here for a youth service we're here for
[1:18:09] a gathering and and Lord humanity is
[1:18:11] such that as time goes on Lord we may
[1:18:13] have received the victory last Sunday or
[1:18:15] the last service that we were gathered
[1:18:17] Wednesday night po possibly but here we
[1:18:19] are once again on a Saturday and Lord we
[1:18:22] need you once again amen
[1:18:26] we've encountered some things in this
[1:18:28] old realm of time that Lord that that
[1:18:30] make us feel dirty that make us feel
[1:18:32] filthy that that's bombarding our minds
[1:18:35] and Lord we need deliverance we need
[1:18:38] Victory and I pray oh God with all
[1:18:40] that's within Me Oh Lord that you would
[1:18:43] just use me as an instrument of that
[1:18:46] power oh God that you'd come down and
[1:18:49] you would strike these old lips of clay
[1:18:51] that you come down and you touch these
[1:18:53] old ears oh God granted oh God so the
[1:18:56] hearer can be blessed together with the
[1:18:58] speaker oh God and we can say within our
[1:19:01] souls within the depths of who we are
[1:19:03] did not our hearts burn within
[1:19:06] us as you came and talked to us along
[1:19:10] the way so get your glory father God
[1:19:13] just reporting the service one more time
[1:19:16] who knows this very well may be my last
[1:19:18] time this might be our last time to
[1:19:21] gather here so Lord may we not miss it
[1:19:24] may we not miss our opportunity to lay
[1:19:26] hold on to eternal life and it's in
[1:19:29] Jesus Christ we pray and ask these
[1:19:31] things
[1:19:33] amen amen you may be seated oh isn't he
[1:19:38] good isn't he
[1:19:40] good we
[1:19:43] are presented with today a very familiar
[1:19:49] scripture by the way I often laugh when
[1:19:52] I even say that and hear it a familiar
[1:19:54] your scripture they should all be
[1:19:58] familiar but we're we're here with a
[1:20:00] story and quite frankly this is one of
[1:20:03] my uh most inspiring one one of one of
[1:20:06] them in in the scripture because it
[1:20:08] speaks of a situation where as I was
[1:20:10] just saying there a moment ago the the
[1:20:12] the the calling the purpose the the
[1:20:14] desire that we should have to spread
[1:20:16] light because this little girl this
[1:20:18] woman here at the well that day she did
[1:20:19] not know that she was an eternal
[1:20:22] creature right but yet she was reled
[1:20:25] religious she had an experience that
[1:20:28] that that that let her know enough that
[1:20:30] well I I I believe the message or we can
[1:20:32] say all say it that way I I believe I
[1:20:33] believe God sent a prophet all of these
[1:20:35] things but do you realize that you are
[1:20:38] an eternal
[1:20:39] creature I'm thoroughly convinced that
[1:20:42] if we really knew who we were then we
[1:20:46] would be doing those Greater Works that
[1:20:48] he spoke about we would be seeing more
[1:20:50] done Among Us
[1:20:54] but my thought today just if you if
[1:20:56] you'll travel with me just for a moment
[1:20:58] and and for those that care I'm looking
[1:20:59] at my
[1:21:01] watch that I'm conscious of my time and
[1:21:04] for those that care I took my jacket off
[1:21:05] so you think well he's either going to
[1:21:06] preach long or he's not so I'll take
[1:21:09] care of all of you
[1:21:10] amen you know in a time like this too
[1:21:13] that you know the prophet says there's
[1:21:14] three types of Believers in every
[1:21:16] service so I've got a lot of work to do
[1:21:20] today is that right y'all listen fast
[1:21:24] and we might preach fast but but
[1:21:26] actually in that why are we here anyway
[1:21:29] who is rushing the
[1:21:31] preacher who are you don't rush the
[1:21:33] preacher this is eternal life
[1:21:37] amen amen you can rush me if you want to
[1:21:39] but you know what I got breakes on this
[1:21:43] model I might camp out for a little
[1:21:46] while around I better not feel
[1:21:49] that so I give you permission to go now
[1:21:52] if you need to go go
[1:21:54] but just a little
[1:21:57] thought again I can only be me brother
[1:21:59] the
[1:22:02] way leaving things
[1:22:05] behind leaving things behind John 4 and3
[1:22:09] says he left Judea and departed again
[1:22:12] unto Galilee just to give a little back
[1:22:14] uh uh backstory just to to to gather my
[1:22:17] thoughts just a little bit but he Jesus
[1:22:20] he takes out on this
[1:22:22] journey and he doesn't take
[1:22:25] the route that most Jews would take if
[1:22:28] you just let me for a moment I'm going
[1:22:30] to speak of him as being a Jew we know
[1:22:31] he's not a gene or he was neither Jew
[1:22:33] nor Gentile but in in this instance he
[1:22:35] he didn't take the route that that
[1:22:37] typically a Jew would take because there
[1:22:39] were typically two routes that the Jews
[1:22:41] would take in order to prevent from
[1:22:43] going through Samaria sikar which was a
[1:22:46] word and and of reproach but they would
[1:22:48] they would either looking at a map of
[1:22:50] the area there they would either uh go
[1:22:52] up uh along the the the the western side
[1:22:55] of the coast along the Mediterranean
[1:22:57] they' travel that way or they would go
[1:22:59] up on the Eastern side they would go up
[1:23:01] the Jordan River which would lead them
[1:23:02] into the Sea of Galilee all for the Ben
[1:23:05] even though it was longer it took them
[1:23:06] longer to go that way all for the
[1:23:07] benefit of not going through
[1:23:10] Samaria those people look funny they
[1:23:12] they smell funny they act
[1:23:15] different huh God put it on your heart
[1:23:19] maybe that that that beggar out on the
[1:23:20] street literally standing on the corner
[1:23:22] God put it on your heart
[1:23:25] yes to go give them a little bit of food
[1:23:27] a little bit of money or to go witness
[1:23:28] to them well I don't want to because
[1:23:30] they smell funny H I don't care what you
[1:23:34] look like I don't care what you've done
[1:23:36] I don't care what you are going to do to
[1:23:39] me I want to show forth Jesus Christ
[1:23:42] Wherever I Go amen are we not called to
[1:23:45] be Jesus Christ or are we not called to
[1:23:48] be Jesus Christ and Jesus himself
[1:23:50] embodied love and I say this everywhere
[1:23:52] I go because this is simply who I am
[1:23:55] Jesus embodied love and if we're not
[1:23:59] being that to
[1:24:01] everybody if we're not being loved to
[1:24:04] everybody then we're missing it forget
[1:24:07] about William brandom forget about
[1:24:09] Malachi for in the sense of that message
[1:24:12] that he brought if you're not being
[1:24:14] loved forget all of
[1:24:18] that but they would not go through
[1:24:21] Samaria because to them the Samar an
[1:24:24] were considered ethnically and
[1:24:27] religiously
[1:24:29] unclean
[1:24:31] right hear me now now now in looking at
[1:24:36] it and studying it out the the the the
[1:24:37] distance is about a 70 mile period And
[1:24:40] depending on what type of traveler you
[1:24:42] are or or or or how long whatever you
[1:24:44] take with you or who you're traveling
[1:24:46] with the this this journey this distance
[1:24:48] would take anywhere from from two two
[1:24:50] and a half days up to two
[1:24:52] weeks now to the Natural Observer being
[1:24:57] that this was H the halfway point
[1:24:59] between what the on his journey the
[1:25:02] halfway point of the journey it makes
[1:25:04] sense looking at it from a natural
[1:25:06] observation it makes sense that Jesus
[1:25:09] would be stopping to take a rest because
[1:25:12] even in verse six there in John tells us
[1:25:15] it even says that he was wearied with
[1:25:18] the
[1:25:19] journey how many weary Journey folk do
[1:25:21] we have today getting wearied along the
[1:25:24] way doing what God has called you to do
[1:25:26] but you get weary
[1:25:30] sometimes now I like the cute folk y'all
[1:25:33] probably if you heard me preach you
[1:25:34] heard me say this many times the cute
[1:25:35] folk they don't get
[1:25:39] weary I like those cute folk
[1:25:42] yeah
[1:25:44] amen getting wearied with his journey
[1:25:47] here the the the master of it all the
[1:25:50] creator of everything was
[1:25:52] weary and if he got weari in what he was
[1:25:55] doing so shall we but we're still called
[1:25:58] we still got a
[1:25:59] purpose so St John 4 introduces us to a
[1:26:03] woman and we don't even know what her
[1:26:05] name
[1:26:06] was scripture don't even name her she
[1:26:08] she was she was uname she was a nobody
[1:26:11] she was a friends dweller and maybe
[1:26:14] you're here today maybe maybe you feel
[1:26:16] like that little woman in the sense that
[1:26:18] you you think that you're just a nobody
[1:26:20] why because somebody in churches treated
[1:26:23] you bad
[1:26:25] right if you're here today and feel that
[1:26:28] way I'm letting you know that you are
[1:26:30] somebody in Christ and if you are the
[1:26:32] person that's made that person feel bad
[1:26:34] you better find out who you are in
[1:26:37] Christ because this word will make you
[1:26:40] there's a power there's a power in this
[1:26:42] word that will cause you to live the
[1:26:45] right kind of
[1:26:47] life I'm not talking about a form I'm
[1:26:49] not talking about a tradition I'm not
[1:26:51] talking about all of these things I'm
[1:26:52] talking about a genuine in life in
[1:26:54] Christ you said brother Joel That's
[1:26:56] mighty simple well it's simply going to
[1:26:58] get us out of here one
[1:27:03] day my a fringe
[1:27:07] dweller I begin to think about these
[1:27:09] things being been invited to a youth
[1:27:11] service the youth today as well as as
[1:27:13] even the adults but the youth today
[1:27:15] they're being bombarded with so
[1:27:17] much so many things
[1:27:20] amen there has to be somebody
[1:27:23] surrounding them in their life Mom Dad
[1:27:25] don't give up on your
[1:27:29] young I don't care where they are I
[1:27:31] don't care where they they they what
[1:27:33] they've done you still go out in love
[1:27:36] you remember the prodigal son that that
[1:27:38] Daddy that father he saw him from
[1:27:42] afar he didn't write him off he didn't
[1:27:45] dismiss him why because he loved that
[1:27:49] boy that's your heritage that's a part
[1:27:51] of your promise to the Natural eye this
[1:27:55] was a chance encounter to the critical
[1:27:58] eye he should not have been where he was
[1:28:01] at that particular time there's somebody
[1:28:05] somewhere always up in your business yes
[1:28:07] sir somebody always
[1:28:12] meddling you just might be meddling in
[1:28:14] the Divine Providence of
[1:28:17] God right so get your little bony scny
[1:28:21] finger put it in your pocket
[1:28:26] is that all right because Divine
[1:28:29] leadership is never fully understood
[1:28:31] it's never understood fully huh people
[1:28:34] are not going to understand why you live
[1:28:36] the way that you live it's not up to
[1:28:38] them to understand that it's up to them
[1:28:40] to understand the Christ that's in show
[1:28:42] them
[1:28:44] Christ show them the manifestation of
[1:28:47] what love really
[1:28:50] is faith wants delivered to the Saints
[1:28:52] the prophet says it this way and there
[1:28:54] there a visible light in the shape of a
[1:28:56] dove what a faith he had talking about
[1:28:58] him him being weary on his journey here
[1:29:01] and and or or tying in that way walked
[1:29:03] about
[1:29:05] calmly could you think of the weight
[1:29:07] many times I think of this the the
[1:29:09] weight and the and the strain that that
[1:29:11] was on Jesus the man the body the boy
[1:29:14] the weight that was on him but the
[1:29:16] prophet says it this way he walked about
[1:29:19] calmly his persecutors on every side
[1:29:22] making fun of him blast fer
[1:29:25] babbler his own received him not but he
[1:29:29] walked steady knowing just exactly that
[1:29:32] God was in him ordaining his
[1:29:37] destination God is in you ordaining your
[1:29:39] destination you say I don't understand
[1:29:41] what I'm going through it's not
[1:29:43] important that you understand what
[1:29:44] you're going through it's important that
[1:29:46] you understand where you're on your way
[1:29:49] too if you understand where you're going
[1:29:52] it'll help you a little bit of
[1:29:54] understanding where you are
[1:29:56] now there you are every person that's
[1:29:59] born of the spirit of God that knows
[1:30:01] that holy spirit's in you rests assured
[1:30:05] God knows your destination walk calmly
[1:30:08] before
[1:30:10] him leaving things behind we'll get
[1:30:12] there shortly so the Jews they resented
[1:30:17] and despised the Samaritans and guess
[1:30:19] what the Samaritans rented resented and
[1:30:21] despised the Jews
[1:30:24] that like the devil they don't ain't
[1:30:25] going to shake my hand I ain't going to
[1:30:26] shake
[1:30:30] theirs they didn't invite me to dinner I
[1:30:32] ain't going to invite them to
[1:30:34] dinner you inviting them to dinner may
[1:30:36] be what breaks that
[1:30:39] devil huh where can I
[1:30:46] hide so these two strangers they begin
[1:30:49] to have a conversation we're we're
[1:30:51] familiar with the story I know but but
[1:30:53] it was his dress and it was his speech
[1:30:57] was all that she needed listen to this
[1:30:59] it was all that she needed to know not
[1:31:02] so much who he was but rather what he
[1:31:07] was right the way he's dressed and the
[1:31:10] way that he spoke and and and and it
[1:31:12] that was all that she needed to
[1:31:14] formulate an
[1:31:16] opinion she was satisfied with what he
[1:31:19] was but she needed to know who amen he
[1:31:23] was right amen now I I wonder often
[1:31:26] wonder how many how many Jews she she
[1:31:30] had encountered in her
[1:31:32] past and in her her goings about in life
[1:31:36] that had berated her that had belittled
[1:31:39] her that considered her nothing amen
[1:31:43] hear me now Jews religious people
[1:31:46] treating somebody as though they're
[1:31:47] beneath
[1:31:49] them in fact I heard brother juel fory
[1:31:51] say this this is stuck with me was years
[1:31:53] ago he was speaking about this very this
[1:31:56] very encounter and he said that when
[1:31:58] Jesus went out and began his public
[1:32:00] Ministry which we know that he
[1:32:02] identified who he truly was through this
[1:32:03] woman or or at the what at this time but
[1:32:07] he said the first Spirit the first
[1:32:09] Spirit he encountered was
[1:32:12] racism that's a real one how you know
[1:32:15] brother
[1:32:18] Joel it's
[1:32:21] real it is real so here she was and no
[1:32:26] doubt that this man she was thinking
[1:32:29] this that no doubt this Jew this man she
[1:32:32] began because of she knew who he was and
[1:32:34] where he was from no doubt she was
[1:32:37] bracing herself for
[1:32:39] slander bracing herself for ridicule
[1:32:42] another battle to be battled another
[1:32:44] opportunity to be
[1:32:46] belittled maybe you come to church and
[1:32:48] you think well well here I'm I'm going
[1:32:49] to go to church again and nobody's going
[1:32:51] to be free me nobody's going to shake my
[1:32:53] hand nobody's going to treat me kind but
[1:32:56] you came
[1:32:58] anyway you're here to receive something
[1:33:01] from the
[1:33:02] Lord and sure enough as expected this
[1:33:05] stranger this Jew speaks to her as
[1:33:08] though she is nothing more than a
[1:33:10] servant right the first words out of his
[1:33:13] mouth to this woman was give me
[1:33:15] something to drink right right let me
[1:33:18] tell you something brother who in the
[1:33:19] world do you think you are do you not
[1:33:21] know I'm the bride of Christ you know
[1:33:24] I've been called I'm Sanctified filled
[1:33:26] with the Holy
[1:33:27] Ghost really acting like that huh give
[1:33:33] me the drink what does she say why why
[1:33:36] are you asking me to get you something
[1:33:38] to drink y'all don't have anything to do
[1:33:41] with us Samaritans
[1:33:43] remember
[1:33:45] attitude that's a
[1:33:47] devil if you got it it's time to go it's
[1:33:51] time to get rid of the
[1:33:52] attitudes this this is a word that's
[1:33:54] changing us
[1:33:57] Saints sweeping through the gates that
[1:33:59] New Jerusalem that new city we think I'm
[1:34:01] I'm going to go I'm going to make it in
[1:34:03] yes you might but guess what that
[1:34:04] attitude that nasty indifference that
[1:34:06] you have when you treat and encounter
[1:34:08] other people that's not
[1:34:10] going yes sir and you want to take it
[1:34:13] and you want to baby it and you you want
[1:34:14] to hold it close to you get rid of that
[1:34:16] thing
[1:34:17] today you said well my mama was that way
[1:34:20] I don't care I ain't talking about your
[1:34:21] mama your mama's going to be lost if she
[1:34:23] don't don't get rid of it you're going
[1:34:25] to be lost if you don't get rid of
[1:34:28] it amen amen amen give me the drink here
[1:34:32] she meets him responds with an attitude
[1:34:35] this is not looking too good is it it's
[1:34:38] not looking very good cuz the way you
[1:34:41] respond to the word will determine
[1:34:43] exactly what you
[1:34:48] get we recall in the scriptures Matthew
[1:34:51] 15 the story of the woman from Canan who
[1:34:54] comes to Jesus her her her daughter is
[1:34:57] is demon-possessed
[1:34:59] Matthew 15:25 the Bible tells us that
[1:35:03] with her having this need 15:25 Matthew
[1:35:06] she says that she worshiped him now
[1:35:09] watch this she worshiped him and that
[1:35:12] word worship here in this particular
[1:35:13] instance meaning to kiss the
[1:35:16] hand like a dog licking his Master's
[1:35:19] Hand so she comes up to him she begins
[1:35:22] to worship she begins to worship so it's
[1:35:25] not so much that she has her hands up
[1:35:26] and she's praising or she's prostrated
[1:35:29] she is at the master close enough to
[1:35:32] kiss his
[1:35:36] hand like a dog licking his Master's
[1:35:39] Hand and she's saying
[1:35:42] Lord help me help me she's worshiping
[1:35:46] him and what does he do watch this he
[1:35:50] meets her in the condition that she
[1:35:52] meets him in come on he he responds to
[1:35:56] her in the way that she responded to
[1:36:00] him you think you're a
[1:36:02] dog hear this I'm not called to your
[1:36:07] race I'm not called to give you dogs
[1:36:10] food huh she came at him in that way so
[1:36:14] he presents a word to her to see what
[1:36:16] she's going to do and we know the
[1:36:18] prophet says that that even Jesus
[1:36:20] himself could not run her off that's
[1:36:22] right in that condition in her low state
[1:36:24] in her time of need he responds in a way
[1:36:27] that that that should have been okay
[1:36:28] your daughter's going to be saved your
[1:36:30] daughter's going to be but he's responds
[1:36:31] in a way that would cause her seemingly
[1:36:34] humanly looking at it to shrink back
[1:36:35] even further fine if that's what he's
[1:36:37] going to be if that's how he's going to
[1:36:39] be I don't want to follow him that's
[1:36:41] right when I when I realize this begin
[1:36:44] to look at that I realize that sometimes
[1:36:47] we don't get anything out of God simply
[1:36:49] because of the way that we come at
[1:36:51] god well I'm not
[1:36:54] worthy and we're not but that Spirit
[1:36:57] needs to be broken off of you because
[1:36:59] you are worthy you've been
[1:37:01] called God's called you to a place in a
[1:37:04] position that's higher than any position
[1:37:06] that this world can ever give
[1:37:09] you so you never receive anything from
[1:37:12] God because you're coming at God as
[1:37:13] though you're not worthy huh just as
[1:37:17] this woman did when she came at him like
[1:37:19] a dog well fine I'm going to treat you
[1:37:21] I'm going to give you some word that's
[1:37:22] fitting for a dog
[1:37:25] and so even when we come that way and we
[1:37:27] we've been praying about something and
[1:37:29] well I'm not worthy and I I guess the
[1:37:30] healing is not for me and but we're
[1:37:32] still praying and you stay sick and you
[1:37:34] stay in that condition you stay trapped
[1:37:36] in your mind and all of these all of
[1:37:38] these things that's going on in your
[1:37:39] life only because you need to change
[1:37:41] your language change your attitude
[1:37:44] change your perspective change your
[1:37:46] [Applause]
[1:37:50] words to get something from the Lord
[1:37:53] because you know how we are in this age
[1:37:55] we're so soft we don't want anybody to
[1:37:56] talk bad about us anybody say anything
[1:37:59] negative huh go pout somewhere off in a
[1:38:03] corner and well where's brother so and
[1:38:05] so brother sister so and so she had been
[1:38:06] to church well I think something I said
[1:38:09] the other night brother Wade but think
[1:38:10] something that I said across the pool
[1:38:11] but I made him upset you better get back
[1:38:13] in the house of God this is your
[1:38:16] livelihood this is not just church this
[1:38:18] is who you
[1:38:21] are so the woman her her preconceptions
[1:38:26] prevented her from fully experiencing
[1:38:29] her
[1:38:30] experience did you catch that I know
[1:38:32] that's simple you say well that ain't
[1:38:34] too profound yes it is her
[1:38:36] preconceptions prevented her from
[1:38:39] experiencing her experience it it was
[1:38:41] her day her moment her
[1:38:46] time her Traditions her religious
[1:38:48] Traditions prevented her from fully
[1:38:51] experiencing her experience here she was
[1:38:54] quoting the word to the
[1:38:56] word like she had some some greater
[1:38:59] revelation of the word but yet she
[1:39:02] presented her religious oity to him
[1:39:05] yeah wait I'm tired I'm tired go weary
[1:39:09] people rallying around and saying God
[1:39:10] sent a prophet well what are you doing
[1:39:13] with that word
[1:39:14] amen how is it changing you how is it
[1:39:17] impacting your life is it causing you to
[1:39:20] to to to to be a true example when
[1:39:22] you're walking through Walmart I hate
[1:39:24] mentioning Walmart when I preach cuz I
[1:39:26] hate that place but it's a it's a common
[1:39:28] everybody knows about Walmart everybody
[1:39:29] goes to Walmart but even when you're
[1:39:31] there when you're pushing that little
[1:39:32] buggy grabbing those items off the shelf
[1:39:34] you can be a light and a
[1:39:39] witness so don't miss your opportunity
[1:39:43] today brother sister don't miss it don't
[1:39:46] turn it away Redemption Redemption
[1:39:49] incompleteness the prophet says it this
[1:39:51] way there was a woman come out out from
[1:39:53] Samaria one time she was
[1:39:57] discouraged she was sinful and had a lot
[1:40:01] of things hanging on her life
[1:40:05] amen no doubt I'm looking at some saints
[1:40:07] today that you're
[1:40:09] discouraged you got a lot of things
[1:40:11] hanging on your life perhaps and she was
[1:40:15] discouraged she went to Jacob's Well for
[1:40:17] Relief and watch what she does and she'd
[1:40:20] go
[1:40:21] back she went to to Jacob's Well for
[1:40:24] Relief and she'd go
[1:40:26] back she'd go to the well and then she'd
[1:40:28] go back and one day one day one day she
[1:40:33] set the water pot
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:36] down and was standing there discouraged
[1:40:39] and there stood The Rock standing by her
[1:40:42] she spake to that rock he gave her a
[1:40:44] great gusher in her
[1:40:46] soul all he wants you to do is talk with
[1:40:49] him communion with him don't let the
[1:40:51] preacher just preach don't let the

[1:41:09] things behind you're laying them down
[1:41:13] amen amen she spake to that rock he gave
[1:41:16] her a great gusher in her soul and I
[1:41:19] pray to God that's what happens today to
[1:41:21] to to someone just but one that a great
[1:41:24] gusher would spring forth in your very
[1:41:27] Soul she ran into the city she never
[1:41:29] come to draw

[1:41:35] life she said come see a man that told
[1:41:38] me everything and I ever done isn't this
[1:41:40] the Christ she spake to the Rock and The
[1:41:43] Rock brought forth its
[1:41:47] water speak to him amen speak to him
[1:41:51] today are you discouraged Ed do you have
[1:41:54] a lot of things hanging on to you of
[1:41:56] Life the trappings of Life maybe family
[1:42:00] strains this is real
[1:42:03] saints this is real people walking
[1:42:05] through life thinking well I'll be okay
[1:42:07] no you're not okay why because you
[1:42:10] haven't called out for help Lord help
[1:42:14] me that thing hanging on to you that
[1:42:17] depression state that all that
[1:42:19] depression that that weariness that
[1:42:21] gloominess that gets around you even
[1:42:22] sick
[1:42:24] itself how are you approaching the
[1:42:27] master how are you coming to him and
[1:42:29] when he responds are you still going to
[1:42:31] say be it unto me or yes Lord I'll hang
[1:42:34] on to that word I don't understand it
[1:42:36] but I'm hanging on to
[1:42:38] it so here we have the longest single
[1:42:41] discourse that Jesus had with any one
[1:42:44] individual in all of the Bible was with
[1:42:46] this
[1:42:48] woman a
[1:42:49] prostitute a Loosely living woman
[1:42:53] that the master of the universe chose to
[1:42:55] come to her and we say we're the bride
[1:42:58] of Christ and we can't lay hold onto
[1:43:01] this word and make it act and do like it
[1:43:03] did in the days of old the M here you
[1:43:06] him I hear the prophet say it now he
[1:43:07] said we must be inspired by the word of
[1:43:10] God that'll make him come to that Worden
[1:43:14] that that your inspiration will bring
[1:43:16] God to that word and then blend them
[1:43:20] together and make it act and do like it
[1:43:23] did in the days of old so we must first
[1:43:26] have to be inspired otherwise it's just
[1:43:28] a book with some words in it otherwise
[1:43:31] it's just a message that a that a man
[1:43:33] spoke but if we're not inspired by it
[1:43:36] it's just going to be dead and all that
[1:43:38] we're going to do is go through the
[1:43:39] motions of of churchianity and all the
[1:43:41] the religiousness that's associated with
[1:43:43] all these things we'll go to this camp
[1:43:45] and this camp this meeting this special
[1:43:47] service and we we'll just go and people
[1:43:49] will say well I saw you last week I saw
[1:43:50] you last month last year good to see you
[1:43:52] again and have no amount of victory in
[1:43:55] your life at
[1:43:56] all that's what I'm weary about that's
[1:44:00] what I'm growing tired of seeing I want
[1:44:02] to see Victorious children of God if we
[1:44:07] are the Queen of Heaven then we need to
[1:44:09] start acting like it to hold our head
[1:44:12] high in dignity
[1:44:15] Amen in fact Malachi
[1:44:18] 4 God identified me before he even
[1:44:21] identified
[1:44:23] William
[1:44:25] Brown you say That's mighty bold brother
[1:44:27] Joel that's just the word of God right
[1:44:29] he says behold I send you sir
[1:44:34] Elijah
[1:44:36] huh take that and do whatever you want
[1:44:38] to with it but it's still the Bible so
[1:44:41] if he's getting my attention he has
[1:44:42] something for me to hear amen so if God
[1:44:46] got my attention and he telling me he
[1:44:49] said to me Elijah then I want to hear
[1:44:50] what Elijah has to say because God God's
[1:44:53] wanting me to do something with what
[1:44:55] Elijah had to
[1:44:56] say
[1:44:59] Amen the first words that Jesus speaks
[1:45:02] to her is about his
[1:45:05] need you ever think about that right
[1:45:08] right when they have this encounter the
[1:45:10] very first thing he says to her is about
[1:45:12] what he has need
[1:45:14] of his
[1:45:16] need he met her where she was in her
[1:45:19] condition he's here today he has stepped
[1:45:21] and filled this room to meet you where
[1:45:24] you are amen you say brother Joel you
[1:45:27] don't know my condition you don't know
[1:45:28] how low I've been you don't you don't
[1:45:29] know all of the the the the trappings
[1:45:32] that that are holding me bound but I
[1:45:34] don't need to know but I'm here to let
[1:45:36] you know those things don't have to hold
[1:45:37] you any
[1:45:39] longer a prisoner in your
[1:45:43] mind there's some chains I believe are
[1:45:45] going to be broken
[1:45:49] today he met her where she was in her
[1:45:52] condition
[1:45:53] and in his Humanity he matched her
[1:45:57] condition think about that in his
[1:45:59] Humanity he matched her condition
[1:46:01] because he could have just swooped in
[1:46:04] did all this Great Mighty thing and the
[1:46:06] wind begin to swirl and all these things
[1:46:08] and music Celestial music begin to play
[1:46:10] no that would have scared the liver out
[1:46:12] of that
[1:46:14] girl God will meet you where you
[1:46:18] are God will speak to you in a way that
[1:46:21] you are familiar with amen
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:24] you know it's his voice so he met her
[1:46:27] where she was he was discouraged she was
[1:46:31] discouraged he was weary she was weary
[1:46:35] he was tired she was tired he was alone
[1:46:40] she was alone she he was carrying a
[1:46:44] burden and a weight and so was she
[1:46:46] carrying a burden and a
[1:46:48] weight these two seemingly opposite
[1:46:50] individuals going through the same thing
[1:46:53] and what does the devil want to do
[1:46:55] sometimes to make you think that you're
[1:46:56] the only
[1:46:57] one you're the only one that's
[1:46:59] struggling with this thing you're the
[1:47:01] only one that was violated by an uncle
[1:47:03] or a brother or a father or
[1:47:06] whoever there's others that's struggling
[1:47:08] with that same thing today and God is
[1:47:10] here to set you free from that
[1:47:12] thing leaving things
[1:47:16] behind discouraged weary tired alone
[1:47:19] carrying a burden why Romans 8 and3 says
[1:47:22] it this way for what the law could not
[1:47:24] do in that it was weak through the flesh
[1:47:27] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:47:30] of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin
[1:47:33] in the
[1:47:34] flesh so Jesus the body the the the boy
[1:47:38] the man the flesh condemn sin in the
[1:47:41] flesh so that's letting me know brother
[1:47:44] way that I too in my body in my flesh
[1:47:47] can condemn sin I don't so much need the
[1:47:50] hands laid on me and that's good and we
[1:47:52] believe in that we'll do that but God
[1:47:54] says that we can stand in our humanity
[1:47:57] and condemn the very works and hes of
[1:48:00] the devil
[1:48:03] amen I believe this
[1:48:05] Saints you can float out in the
[1:48:07] stratosphere if you want to and get out
[1:48:09] in the Deep things and I love the Deep
[1:48:10] things believe the Deep things live the
[1:48:12] Deep things but it's the simple things
[1:48:15] it's right down where we live cuz see I
[1:48:18] can hide behind the seal I can hide
[1:48:20] behind the Deep mystery and say Amen to
[1:48:22] it but it gets a little squeaky when you
[1:48:24] get down on where I
[1:48:27] live that's what I want I want some
[1:48:29] preaching I want I want a word that's
[1:48:31] going to scour me
[1:48:32] out I remember growing up washing my
[1:48:35] momma on the old Wash Tub she get those
[1:48:36] old clothes and that old wash and they
[1:48:38] wash up and she just go to that washing
[1:48:40] board and just scrub and scrub and scrub
[1:48:43] getting the clothes clean getting all
[1:48:45] the dirt every all the filth everything
[1:48:47] out so that's what I want to do today is
[1:48:49] take this word and just scrub scrub get
[1:48:51] all the dirt
[1:48:53] get all the filth get all the
[1:48:58] trash Hebrews 4 and 15 says for we have
[1:49:02] not an high priest which cannot be
[1:49:04] touched with the feeling of our
[1:49:07] infirmities the feeling of just that not
[1:49:10] even speaking anything by the way but
[1:49:13] not not even saying a word but with a an
[1:49:15] inward cry God please take this thing
[1:49:19] from
[1:49:20] me nobody knows the hurt that I'm going
[1:49:23] through Nobody Knows the scars that I
[1:49:25] couldn't tell anybody what I'm going
[1:49:27] through and what happened to me but God
[1:49:29] Can Be Touched By The Very feeling of
[1:49:32] your infirmity and many times when we
[1:49:33] think of infirmity we think of in the
[1:49:35] body and that's true he can be touched
[1:49:37] by those but also that inward groaning
[1:49:40] that inward
[1:49:41] part that spirit that has been wounded
[1:49:44] that soul that has been
[1:49:46] scarred that that that Spirit that's
[1:49:48] been diverted yes on Sir science will
[1:49:52] tell you psychology will tell you that
[1:49:55] when a person experiences a traumatic
[1:49:57] event maybe it's sexual abuse or
[1:49:59] physical abuse or something along those
[1:50:00] lines maybe just three four five 10
[1:50:03] years old at that moment there's a part
[1:50:06] of your brain that shuts
[1:50:09] off you don't develop and grow any
[1:50:11] further in that part and anytime there's
[1:50:15] another trauma another bump your mind
[1:50:18] will take you back to that event to that
[1:50:20] moment and see that's what the devil
[1:50:22] want you stuck in is the
[1:50:26] past Moses said who who do I tell them
[1:50:29] sent me he says tell them I am that I am
[1:50:33] and anybody that knows the English
[1:50:34] language knows that I am am is a present
[1:50:37] tense
[1:50:40] verb so therefore if you capture God in
[1:50:43] the present tense he will always be
[1:50:45] present
[1:50:47] amen but if you're laying hold on to a
[1:50:49] god of the past well God sent a prophet
[1:50:53] yes he did but you know what that
[1:50:55] message that he sent is still going on
[1:50:58] today why because it's living in me I
[1:51:01] keep Malachi for present I keep Malachi
[1:51:05] for
[1:51:10] alive yes that's bold yes that's
[1:51:15] true my for we have not a high priest
[1:51:18] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:51:20] of our infirmities but was in all points
[1:51:22] tempted like as we are yet without
[1:51:26] sin Hebrews 11:6 says but without faith
[1:51:31] we know this it is impossible to please
[1:51:33] him for he for for he that cometh to God
[1:51:36] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:51:38] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:51:41] Him diligently giving some attention to
[1:51:45] it putting a little work into it amen
[1:51:48] well I read my Bible and I prayed today
[1:51:50] I read you know no Dil ently seeking God
[1:51:54] where are you as we know in the Garden
[1:51:56] of Eden that day it was God crying out
[1:51:58] for Adam Adam where are you he was
[1:52:01] looking for Adam even though he knew
[1:52:03] where he
[1:52:04] was amen God knows exactly where you are
[1:52:08] and in what you're going through but
[1:52:09] he's waiting for you to call on
[1:52:12] him amen I think of that old song if you
[1:52:15] call on Jesus he will answer a prayer
[1:52:19] old Pentecostal song just over and over
[1:52:21] if you call on Jesus he will answer
[1:52:24] prayer he will do that very thing we got
[1:52:26] to call on him from before the
[1:52:29] foundation of the earth God's purpose
[1:52:32] was to share his eternal life with
[1:52:38] Humanity from before the world was even
[1:52:41] formed he had a desire he had a purpose
[1:52:44] he had an intention and that was he
[1:52:46] wanted to share his deity with you amen
[1:52:51] amen that you can walk upright even
[1:52:54] though you've been knocked down that you
[1:52:56] can walk upright even though you've been
[1:52:58] scarred and wounded you can still carry
[1:53:01] yourself with a royal air not with your
[1:53:05] nose stuck up in the air but with a
[1:53:08] royal air dignity huh people a curious
[1:53:14] wonderment Divine Healing the message

[1:53:20] go all the way back I don't just stick
[1:53:21] around the seals and go from there I go
[1:53:23] all the way back cuz the message is the
[1:53:25] message is the message and by the way
[1:53:28] the message is the
[1:53:30] message did you get my
[1:53:32] message you understand what I said
[1:53:36] because see this word he either meant
[1:53:38] what he said or he did
[1:53:41] not and my part in that is I either

[1:54:13] me so we should be the happiest person
[1:54:16] on the face of the world think about it
[1:54:18] if everybody just that one thought if
[1:54:20] everybody lived that way think about how
[1:54:24] Victorious things would be think about
[1:54:26] how the services would be think about
[1:54:28] how God would just open up those windows
[1:54:30] and pour these things
[1:54:34] out but what do we do we close the
[1:54:36] window oh it's a little Breezy in here I

[1:55:42] God would come down lock watch what
[1:55:45] watch how the prophet places this that a
[1:55:46] holy infinite God would come down and

[2:00:14] he was the one that extended the
[2:00:15] invitation to it's his fault this plan
[2:00:17] was to be to the praise of the glory of
[2:00:20] his grace listen to this let me tell you
[2:00:23] how special you are through the words of
[2:00:25] the prophet of the messenger of this day
[2:00:27] it was the Plan of Redemption it was the
[2:00:29] Plan of Salvation now listen closely God
[2:00:33] being a savior it was necessary that he
[2:00:37] predestinate a man who would require
[2:00:41] salvation don't just stop right there it
[2:00:43] gets great it gets better right who
[2:00:46] would require salvation in order in
[2:00:48] order to give himself reason and purpose
[2:00:52] Pur of
[2:00:54] being so your Victory today gives him
[2:00:57] reason and purpose to be you are the
[2:01:01] reason that he hung there on that cross
[2:01:03] you are the very reason if it was just
[2:01:06] you he would have taken those stripes he
[2:01:08] would have taken those those whippings
[2:01:10] those those he would have heard those
[2:01:11] words he would have taken that spit on
[2:01:13] his
[2:01:15] face what is your view of Calvary what
[2:01:18] does Calvary look like to you oh right I
[2:01:22] think sometimes we forget we got to
[2:01:24] realize that there was blood there that
[2:01:26] day huh there was a life that was
[2:01:28] expired but that life got up amen so
[2:01:31] that lets us know when we get down to
[2:01:32] our lowest point where we can't go any
[2:01:34] further if we are in him we can't get
[2:01:36] back up
[2:01:38] amen St John 4:28 the woman then left
[2:01:42] her water pot and went her way into the
[2:01:45] city now the Bible doesn't record and I
[2:01:48] couldn't find maybe you could but I I
[2:01:50] didn't find anything that that that she
[2:01:53] ever returned for that water
[2:01:57] pot she didn't come back to the Altar
[2:02:00] and pick it up right when she stood when
[2:02:02] she knelt down at the altar that day and
[2:02:04] and was crying out in Blood and and or
[2:02:06] or snot and everything tears running
[2:02:08] down Dr to the a mess looked awful but
[2:02:12] she said Lord I'm laying it at your
[2:02:13] altar and what did she do before she
[2:02:14] went back to her Pew she picked it back
[2:02:16] up but the Bible does not say that she
[2:02:19] ever returned for that water pot why
[2:02:21] because she had left it amen behind amen
[2:02:25] so we were able to conclude that it may
[2:02:28] have been something that wasn't that
[2:02:30] significant to her after
[2:02:32] all but then again it
[2:02:35] was much like her
[2:02:37] life this water pot that she carried to
[2:02:40] the well that
[2:02:42] day it was brought to the well
[2:02:46] empty you said brother Joel I'm empty
[2:02:48] I'm spent I'm done I don't know what
[2:02:51] what else to do I've come to church I'm
[2:02:53] empty I'm so weary I'm so tired I'm
[2:02:57] tired of fighting this battle I'm tired
[2:02:58] of fighting this thing I I I I want it
[2:03:01] gone but so like her coming to the well
[2:03:04] that day here you are in this service
[2:03:06] this youth this Fellowship service weary
[2:03:08] tired I don't care how old you are you
[2:03:10] say you might young trying to be telling
[2:03:12] me what to do this is the

[2:03:20] anybody amen the old old the young the
[2:03:23] in the out the indifferent
[2:03:25] everybody brother the
[2:03:27] intention the purpose The Habit the
[2:03:32] routine for her going to the well was to
[2:03:35] what was to fill with it with water once
[2:03:38] she got to the well that was her routine
[2:03:40] that was her habit that was her purpose

[2:03:44] going to sing that song then we're going
[2:03:45] to sing this we do that we know the
[2:03:47] routine right but I'm tired of coming in
[2:03:51] a routine
[2:03:53] way I want something fresh I want to
[2:03:55] bring my water pot and I want to leave
[2:03:58] it I don't want to pick it back up and
[2:04:01] take it back with me huh cuz that's why
[2:04:04] she was there to fill her water pot
[2:04:07] here's my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord huh
[2:04:12] fill it up Redemption incompleteness I
[2:04:15] want to read it again there was a woman
[2:04:17] come out from Samaria one time she was
[2:04:19] discouraged she was sin and had a lot of
[2:04:22] things hanging on her life what's
[2:04:25] hanging on your life today oh yes what's
[2:04:28] hanging what's dangling out there huh
[2:04:32] that the devil wants to lower the God
[2:04:33] wants to lower the boom on that thing to
[2:04:36] get rid of it once and for
[2:04:39] all and she was discouraged she went to
[2:04:42] Jacob's Well for Relief and she go back
[2:04:45] she go to Jacob's Well and go back in
[2:04:47] one day she set the water pot down set
[2:04:50] down your water pot
[2:04:52] sis set your water pot down brother
[2:04:55] today the day here's your opportunity to
[2:04:57] leave these things behind she set it
[2:04:59] down and there she was discouraged and
[2:05:00] there stood The Rock standing by her she
[2:05:02] spake to that
[2:05:04] rock amen amen see a man that told me
[2:05:08] everything that ever had done isn't this
[2:05:09] the Christ she spake to the Rock and The
[2:05:12] Rock brought forth his water so here she
[2:05:14] was doing what she always
[2:05:18] did so here you are doing what you
[2:05:20] always do when you come the church you
[2:05:23] may be visiting such as me but still
[2:05:25] there's a certain routine that you're
[2:05:26] used
[2:05:27] to but God's here to shake us up without
[2:05:30] that thing today it's time to leave some
[2:05:32] things behind
[2:05:35] Saints so here she was doing what she
[2:05:37] was always doing and not realizing she
[2:05:42] had no clue that the answers to her
[2:05:45] deepest desire was about to be
[2:05:49] met you had no clue when you came into
[2:05:52] the house of God today that there was
[2:05:54] going to be some questions answered for
[2:05:58] youen that spark of Eternity has been
[2:06:01] ignited around the illumination of this
[2:06:04] word has expanded itself around
[2:06:07] you and with the illumination and the
[2:06:09] power of this word it's time to grow
[2:06:12] up it's time to grow it's time to grow a
[2:06:14] little higher in Christ so what did the
[2:06:18] woman do she left her water pot
[2:06:22] teaching on Moses this is for the the
[2:06:24] the the the youth aspect of the service
[2:06:27] teaching on Moses 1956 Here We Go Again
[2:06:29] way back there
[2:06:31] yep now boys and girls you know what
[2:06:33] there's a lot of things in the world
[2:06:35] that's real valuable and one of those
[2:06:37] things is you have it with you
[2:06:41] today let me let me back up boys and
[2:06:44] girls men and women brothers and sisters
[2:06:47] you know what there's a lot of things in
[2:06:49] the world that's real valuable in one of
[2:06:51] those things is you have it with you
[2:06:52] today and it's the soul that's inside of
[2:06:55] that
[2:06:56] body that's what the devil's after he
[2:06:59] may be buffeting you with cancer or this
[2:07:01] sickness this disease or that that
[2:07:02] weariness in your brain but really what
[2:07:04] he's after is your
[2:07:06] soul his intent is to take you down he
[2:07:09] wants that
[2:07:10] soul and that's the most valuable thing
[2:07:12] in the world to you is that right mother
[2:07:14] say Amen mother say amen and the most
[2:07:16] valuable thing that you got is your soul
[2:07:18] now if you keep your soul then you're
[2:07:20] going to lose it this to me is probably
[2:07:22] one of the most simplest things in the
[2:07:24] message but yet it's profound to the
[2:07:27] point where if we get a hold to that one
[2:07:29] thing if we sometimes we have things in
[2:07:31] our life that we want to hold on to what
[2:07:34] did Abraham do he took
[2:07:36] ishmail he raised him up before the Lord
[2:07:39] this is my little ish oh I love him so
[2:07:41] much that's my that's my
[2:07:44] baby I've had this thing all my life my
[2:07:47] mama was that
[2:07:48] way you got to you got to let go of that
[2:07:52] it's time for ish to
[2:07:54] go the most valuable thing that you got
[2:07:56] is your soul now if you keep your soul
[2:07:58] then you're going to lose it and if you
[2:08:00] lose your soul then you're going to save
[2:08:03] it if you lose your soul to Jesus see in
[2:08:06] other words if you believe on Jesus you
[2:08:08] become his
[2:08:11] disciples and then if you give your life
[2:08:13] to Jesus when you're young like this
[2:08:15] then you're you're he's going to save it
[2:08:17] to everlasting life
[2:08:21] but if you want to keep it you're going
[2:08:23] to lose it
[2:08:24] yes if you keep that
[2:08:27] devil you're going to lose
[2:08:30] everything bud let go of that thing let
[2:08:34] it's it's just that
[2:08:36] simple that thing dangling on you
[2:08:39] that'll torment you at night when you're
[2:08:40] in bed alone and there that thing just
[2:08:42] coming at you maybe when you're by
[2:08:45] yourself or maybe even when you come to
[2:08:47] church it's still there it's time to Let
[2:08:50] It Go yes
[2:08:52] sir now you remember that now that it's
[2:08:55] the most valuable thing in the world is
[2:08:56] your little soul and if you keep it
[2:08:58] you'll lose it if you give it to Jesus
[2:09:01] you save
[2:09:03] it give that thing to Jesus concerned
[2:09:06] and convinced when I had a little vision
[2:09:08] I don't want to call it a translation I
[2:09:10] never had a vision like that I was
[2:09:11] standing up there looking at it looking
[2:09:12] back at myself here recently many of you
[2:09:14] read in the magazines and things friends
[2:09:16] you you can't afford to miss that you
[2:09:18] can't afford to whatever you do don't
[2:09:20] miss it to prophet
[2:09:22] now there's somewhere there I was there
[2:09:24] just as I am here looking back at myself
[2:09:27] and I've had Visions I know what Visions
[2:09:28] are it was it was a vision it was the
[2:09:30] strangest one I ever had and I seen the
[2:09:33] people the ones that's gone on I seen
[2:09:34] them there the old was young and they
[2:09:36] were standing there human beings just
[2:09:39] like I am beyond the curtain of
[2:09:41] time only without sin my what a place
[2:09:45] amen that alone I don't don't care about
[2:09:48] a new body just let me be somewhere
[2:09:50] there's no sin
[2:09:53] I care about my new body y'all know what
[2:09:54] I was saying I'm going to get that too
[2:09:56] but if I could go just where there be no
[2:09:58] sin that that' be great that'd be
[2:10:01] wonderful it was beyond Perfection
[2:10:03] Sublime you just couldn't mention what
[2:10:05] it was and when I knew that I had to
[2:10:07] return back there's only one thing that
[2:10:10] I would return to try to persuade people
[2:10:14] yes so that's what I'm doing here today
[2:10:16] is trying to persuade you trying to let
[2:10:17] you know that there is a life that's
[2:10:20] beyond this life life and everything in
[2:10:23] this life that's holding you here you
[2:10:24] got to let it go you got to leave it
[2:10:26] behind whatever you do the prophet says
[2:10:29] don't miss it he says it again don't
[2:10:32] miss it and guess what he says it again
[2:10:34] don't miss it you can't afford to miss
[2:10:37] it he says it three times for the Father
[2:10:40] the Son the Holy Ghost right for the
[2:10:43] Lord Jesus Christ so we would catch it
[2:10:46] don't miss it you can't afford to miss
[2:10:48] it everything else let everything else
[2:10:51] go but make ready for that whatever you
[2:10:56] do if Mama don't go I'll Journey on if
[2:11:00] the preacher don't go it's not going to
[2:11:02] hinder me because why I'm on my way to
[2:11:04] canaan's
[2:11:05] land leaving things behind Brethren
[2:11:08] Philippians 3:13 I count not myself to
[2:11:11] have
[2:11:12] apprehended amen but this one thing I do
[2:11:15] the musicians would come this one thing
[2:11:17] I
[2:11:19] do what are you going to do
[2:11:22] Paul forgetting those things which are
[2:11:26] behind I'm not going to go back and pick
[2:11:28] up that water pot I have no more need
[2:11:29] for that water pot because I found a new
[2:11:32] pot in which to hold all the Living
[2:11:35] Waters of Eternity
[2:11:38] amen because she would go and she'd get
[2:11:40] this water and she'd have to come back
[2:11:42] and get
[2:11:43] more he would run out she' have to go
[2:11:45] and get more but drink from this well
[2:11:48] this Fountain of
[2:11:49] Life for forgetting those things which
[2:11:52] are behind and reaching forth unto those
[2:11:54] things which are before that word
[2:11:56] forgetting means to forget somebody say
[2:11:59] forget forget simply forget neglecting
[2:12:03] no longer caring
[2:12:05] for goodbye word I'll be no longer with
[2:12:08] you is that right no longer caring for
[2:12:12] forgotten given over to
[2:12:16] Oblivion if we would forget these things
[2:12:19] that are trapping us here amen they're
[2:12:22] going to be sent to Oblivion anyway and
[2:12:24] guess what if we are still attached to
[2:12:27] that thing guess where we're going to be
[2:12:28] found in
[2:12:30] Oblivion we're not promised Oblivion
[2:12:33] we're promised eternity a land Without
[2:12:35] End a land that had no beginning
[2:12:39] am Paul goes on to say in verse 14 I
[2:12:42] press I press toward the mark for the
[2:12:46] prize of the High Calling of God in
[2:12:48] Christ Jesus that word pressed means to
[2:12:52] run swiftly in order to catch a person
[2:12:56] or a thing to run
[2:12:59] after figuratively it means of one who
[2:13:02] in a race runs swiftly to reach the goal
[2:13:05] am to pursue in a hostile manner it
[2:13:10] ain't no time to be cute it ain't no
[2:13:12] time to be pretty this thing that's
[2:13:14] holding you has to be pressed against in
[2:13:17] a hostile
[2:13:19] manner his brother David was singing the
[2:13:21] song devil we are
[2:13:25] over no
[2:13:28] more and when they sing that song they
[2:13:30] get that little growl
[2:13:34] and it ain't no pretty little it ain't
[2:13:36] no pretty little Sunday school song it's
[2:13:38] got some up to it it's got some power
[2:13:40] behind it because we're pressing toward
[2:13:43] this thing and we're letting all of
[2:13:44] these things
[2:13:47] go leaving things behind woman comes to
[2:13:51] the well that day and she leaves her
[2:13:54] water pot metaphorically that word means
[2:13:57] to pursue to seek after eagerly
[2:14:01] earnestly Endeavor to
[2:14:05] acquire leaving things
[2:14:08] behind what is it in your life what is
[2:14:12] it that's holding you that's trapping
[2:14:14] you that's that that's causing you to to
[2:14:16] pull back just a little bit this this
[2:14:18] this this eternal thing this quality
[2:14:21] that that we've been given this this
[2:14:22] life that we've been promised do you not
[2:14:25] realize the value in it do you real
[2:14:28] realize the depths of it it's like you
[2:14:31] know they talking about the little fish
[2:14:32] in the ocean I'm just going to drink a
[2:14:33] little bit because I don't want to drink
[2:14:34] at all no there there's there's a vast
[2:14:36] amount more you're not going to exhaust
[2:14:39] this
[2:14:40] thing there's a lot more to this there's
[2:14:42] a lot more to God than you realize
[2:14:45] there's a lot more to God than what you
[2:14:46] have now I guarantee you that I promise
[2:14:49] you that because why there's a hunger
[2:14:50] and desire for more of God and if that
[2:14:53] hunger and desire is there then that
[2:14:55] means there's more of God to be
[2:14:58] have
[2:15:01] amen cuz if you listen to the devil long
[2:15:04] enough you will eventually forget your
[2:15:10] testimony if you listen to him long
[2:15:12] enough if you stay around and listen
[2:15:13] what what was her name Nelly Sanders the
[2:15:15] little dance Queen the prophet called
[2:15:16] her yeah huh she come to the service and
[2:15:19] she she gave her life to the Lord and
[2:15:21] she was Victorious and she thought she
[2:15:23] got over that demon she got over past
[2:15:25] all of that but she found herself
[2:15:27] outside the dance hall one night and
[2:15:29] because that was familiar to her and she
[2:15:31] thought she could still attach herself
[2:15:32] to that when God had already delivered
[2:15:34] her she stayed just for a little bit to
[2:15:37] listen cuz that's my
[2:15:40] jam huh and it caught her
[2:15:44] attention and there's nothing more that
[2:15:46] the devil wants than to bring a familiar
[2:15:48] Jam your way right to get you to pause
[2:15:51] just for a moment and the prophet goes
[2:15:54] on to say that before she realized what
[2:15:56] was happening she was in that dance hall
[2:15:59] on on the dance floor that's right and
[2:16:01] not just in the dance hall on the dance
[2:16:03] floor but she was in the arms of some
[2:16:08] man who's the man brother Joel The

[2:16:29] you something young people there is not
[2:16:31] one thing that the devil can give to you
[2:16:34] that's going to be greater than the
[2:16:35] things that are in this
[2:16:37] [Applause]
[2:16:39] world because the prophet has told us
[2:16:42] that he is after your soul he don't give

[2:17:37] to be no more the only thing that shall
[2:17:40] stand when there will be no time is
[2:17:42] those things that are of Eternal quality
[2:17:45] those things that are fulfilling an
[2:17:46] eternal purpose
[2:17:48] now the evidence of the Resurrection is
[2:17:51] in me amen the power of the in fact it's
[2:17:56] going to be my voice it's going to be
[2:17:57] your voice it's going to be the voice of
[2:17:59] the Bride that calls him back just as it
[2:18:01] was with the children of Israel what did
[2:18:04] God say I have surely heard your moans
[2:18:07] I've heard your cries and I've come down
[2:18:10] to deliver you I've come for your words
[2:18:14] Hallelujah so what are the words that
[2:18:16] you're just giving to the atmosphere
[2:18:18] that you're just giving to that
[2:18:19] circumstance what are those words well

[2:18:35] away from that boy he ain't no good she
[2:18:38] ain't no good because listen there's
[2:18:41] been plenty message boys that's ruined a
[2:18:43] lot of message
[2:18:47] girls there's another side to that
[2:18:49] statement H there's been plenty message
[2:18:53] girls that's ruined a lot of message
[2:18:56] boys one thing that that that's always I
[2:18:59] don't want to say baffled but I just
[2:19:01] kind of sort of wondered you know within
[2:19:03] the the the the the depths of the
[2:19:05] message and everything that's in there
[2:19:06] you know and I know it was his
[2:19:07] commission his calling but the the angel
[2:19:09] of the Lord told the prophet says don't
[2:19:11] smoke drink or defile your body you
[2:19:14] don't hear that preached
[2:19:17] much
[2:19:19] huh it's just as good for me it's just
[2:19:21] as good for you as it was for the
[2:19:26] prophet the devil wants nothing more
[2:19:28] than to tear you down yeah you look fine
[2:19:31] Brother po looking good she sees you
[2:19:36] uhhuh you can take all the Selfies you
[2:19:38] want to that picture is going to lead
[2:19:41] you to a path of
[2:19:43] Hell take it down take it off amen huh
[2:19:48] yeah s you look cute the prophet
[2:19:53] says preer what's these splits doing by
[2:19:56] the way they're coming back what's up
[2:19:58] with Dad I shut up I should have did
[2:20:01] that in the first part huh but leaving
[2:20:04] things
[2:20:07] behind that's what we have to do she
[2:20:09] came the the Bible says and upon this
[2:20:12] came his disciples and marveled that he
[2:20:14] talked with the woman yet no man said
[2:20:16] what seekest thou or why talkest thou
[2:20:18] with her and the woman then left her
[2:20:20] water pot and went her way into the City
[2:20:23] and we know I just want to share this
[2:20:25] and I'll close I promise but if in
[2:20:28] looking at at this this occurrence in
[2:20:30] the scriptures we find out that when the
[2:20:32] discip when she leaves and the disciples
[2:20:34] begin to inquire and he begins to talk
[2:20:36] to them and and he begins to tell them
[2:20:38] he says that say not ye there are yet
[2:20:40] four months and then cometh Harvest now
[2:20:43] this woman has just left their company
[2:20:46] and she's gone into the city to go tell
[2:20:48] what had just happened to her I don't
[2:20:51] know the time frame how long it took but
[2:20:53] the evidence of what she had received
[2:20:56] and then what she
[2:20:57] shared came so quickly because Jesus
[2:21:00] begins to talk to the disciples about
[2:21:02] the harvest season he says then four
[2:21:04] months and then cometh the Harvest and
[2:21:06] and so it took four months genuinely or
[2:21:09] typically for when you plant something
[2:21:10] for you begin to see evidence four
[2:21:13] months four months but this is just a
[2:21:15] discourse between Jesus and the
[2:21:17] disciples so that when he's talking to
[2:21:19] them he he's telling them this in four
[2:21:21] months but he says behold I say unto you
[2:21:25] lift up your
[2:21:26] eyes look coming from the city of
[2:21:30] Samaria and look on the fields lift up
[2:21:33] your eyes and look on the fields for
[2:21:34] they are white already to harvest and we
[2:21:37] find out that the people of Samaria
[2:21:39] typically their Garb their dress was
[2:21:42] white they wore white garments so the
[2:21:45] power of what this woman received the
[2:21:48] power of her words the evidence of her
[2:21:51] Revelations was so magnanimous and it
[2:21:54] took effect so quickly that Jesus was
[2:21:57] able to point the disciples immediately
[2:21:59] to the
[2:22:01] evidence of what he was bringing so
[2:22:04] don't back down from this word don't
[2:22:06] don't don't don't ever take this word
[2:22:08] and feel ashamed of this
[2:22:10] word you share this word you live this
[2:22:12] word you become this word because the
[2:22:15] word is coming to the word oh yes and as
[2:22:18] I said it's going to be our voice it
[2:22:20] calls him back huh oh my father how does
[2:22:25] the scriptures close out even so
[2:22:31] come amen come let us bow our heads
[2:22:33] stand with
[2:22:34] me Heavenly Father we love you we honor
[2:22:38] you we adore you oh God we thank you
[2:22:41] Lord for your word we thank you for your
[2:22:43] presence we thank you for coming and and
[2:22:45] and being in this place today oh God we
[2:22:48] thank you for the evidence and the
[2:22:50] realities of Malachi 4 and Lord it's not
[2:22:53] just trapped in the life of a prophet
[2:22:56] lord it's within me it's in Believers
[2:22:58] around the world upon every continent
[2:23:01] upon the face of this earth oh God I
[2:23:03] believe your word is is is is there
[2:23:05] that's being propagated it's being lived
[2:23:07] it's being manifested and oh God I'm
[2:23:10] longing for to see you I want to see you
[2:23:12] Lord but father until we get rid of
[2:23:15] everything that's Earthly until we get
[2:23:19] rid of everything that's holy us here
[2:23:21] you're not coming back so Lord you know
[2:23:23] my purpose you know my unction oh God to
[2:23:26] illuminate a life just as you did that
[2:23:29] day the woman at the well she had no
[2:23:31] idea that she was an eternal creature
[2:23:33] yet she was religious so God if there
[2:23:36] would be some here today the Lord that
[2:23:38] hasn't understood or come to to realize
[2:23:41] their true worth their true value May
[2:23:43] the illumination of this word oh God as
[2:23:46] this overshadowed them as it's crossed
[2:23:48] their path may they rise up in the new
[2:23:50] newness of who they are in you oh God
[2:23:52] granted Lord we love you we thank you
[2:23:54] Lord for the Simplicity of your gospel
[2:23:57] the Simplicity of your life it wasn't a
[2:24:00] simple thing that you did but Lord you

[2:24:14] since the prophet has been called off
[2:24:15] the scene but Lord where are our lives
[2:24:19] where is the god of Elijah I want to see
[2:24:21] you on the scene once again oh God I
[2:24:24] want to see you doing the things that
[2:24:25] you did in the days of old through me
[2:24:27] through my brothers and my sisters

[2:24:31] are people that's trapped in all kinds
[2:24:33] of situations many things that they have
[2:24:35] no control over but oh God the devil has
[2:24:38] them trapped in that moment in that
[2:24:40] season in that event in that time lord
[2:24:43] and they can't get away from it they
[2:24:44] can't get free from it oh God all of
[2:24:46] these things pornography Lord stap the

[2:25:24] value of Calvary may we still see the
[2:25:27] blood streaming down from you oh God and
[2:25:30] we believe oh God that when we see it in
[2:25:33] that way it will cause us to live a
[2:25:34] different life Lord but Lord even there
