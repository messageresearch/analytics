[0:04] had have an answer for the
[0:07] question really ni the italicized words
[0:10] in the King James Bible are words that
[0:11] were added by the translators to help
[0:15] the
[0:16] reader it's usually necessary when
[0:18] translating from one language to another
[0:20] because word meanings and idioms change
[0:23] so so to produce a more readable
[0:26] translation the King James translators
[0:30] added certain words to the Bible text
[0:32] however to make sure that everyone
[0:33] understood that these words were not in
[0:36] the available

[5:14] things have a USB on the side of that
[5:16] which most of them do on the TV well
[5:18] that's what this is plugged in right
[5:20] there no
[5:22] USB
[5:28] that
[5:31] did you hear that I got you some meat
[5:49] yesterday hard to see that should be it
[5:52] right
[5:53] there
[5:58] us
[6:17] set thanks for
[6:24] help okay let's go to paragraph 3:15 and
[6:28] we're going to read through
[6:31] paragraph
[6:32] 315 now what we're talking about statute
[6:34] of perect man I want you to did y'all
[6:36] listen to that service Wednesday
[6:41] night that was that was past
[6:44] good I fill my pad up with
[6:47] notes but remember we talked about that
[6:51] last Sunday right did we not you
[6:54] remember that we talked about last
[6:55] Sunday very same thing he was preaching
[6:57] on except for the overcoming part now
[6:59] now what I'm going to do is take the
[7:00] overcoming part and put it in the
[7:02] statute of perfect man because these are
[7:05] overcoming okay the last overcoming is
[7:09] what anybody listening to me
[7:13] yes same thing you preach last
[7:18] week no that's not why I say it there's
[7:22] eight overcoming yeah right right the
[7:25] eighth one is what Daddy preached on in
[7:27] Revelation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 eight is what
[7:33] you be my son I'll give you a little
[7:35] snippet of that that's adoption this is
[7:38] where adoption happens not down here it
[7:40] happens up here right isn't that what it
[7:42] said you'll be my son okay and then we
[7:45] can back it through I was telling
[7:47] brother Joe even even
[7:48] in the this overcoming here you're in
[7:52] the temple sitting on the
[7:53] throne now what's the throne the throne
[7:55] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[7:58] so we set with him in his throne so just
[8:03] keep that in the back of your mind
[8:04] because these are truly
[8:06] overcoming you're overcoming something
[8:08] to have virtue you're overcome coming
[8:11] something to have knowledge because what
[8:13] are you
[8:15] overcoming who's your biggest enemy me
[8:19] yourself yeah you that's right no me I'm
[8:23] my biggest enemy I must overcome me
[8:26] because my adamic nature throws me
[8:29] contrary to all this Godly all this you
[8:32] understand the godliness part of this we
[8:34] can have virtue uh we can be there's a
[8:37] lot of people in the world is real smart
[8:39] but it's not God smart okay there's a
[8:42] lot of people that has patience I've
[8:43] even seen people out in the world like
[8:45] Brother Richard Wilson said there was a
[8:46] man that worked with him said he was so
[8:48] Meek and humble that if you said Hey Joe
[8:50] I'm going to take your paycheck and I'm
[8:51] going to spend it and you're not going
[8:52] to have nothing he said well it's okay
[8:54] see that's to me that's that's just a a
[8:57] nature born
[9:00] and I like what brother remember what
[9:02] brother Marcus said brother Marcus
[9:04] remember the German that came remember
[9:06] he was talking about going back to your
[9:08] family if your family was blessed then
[9:10] you'll get a blessing through your
[9:12] family or if your family had been cursed
[9:14] somewhere you got to go that curse is
[9:16] going to be on your family right brother
[9:18] Brown said and even the Bible says it it
[9:20] goes back so many
[9:22] generations good and bad all right but
[9:25] now remember the new birth overcomes
[9:27] that bad you say well my father was a
[9:29] drunk my grandpa was see that's that's
[9:32] human that's something you can't do in
[9:34] this right okay but if you get born
[9:36] again it's not alcoholic synonymous it's
[9:38] not that I well I'll always be this no
[9:41] once you're born again amen it's done
[9:45] right that unclean Spirit has gone out
[9:47] of you and gone away from you all right
[9:50] so and and then if you got the Holy
[9:52] Spirit it won't let it come back sure
[9:55] you'll be tempted honestly you're going
[9:57] to be tempted amen
[9:59] right okay I was telling you the story
[10:02] you know when the Lord when the Lord
[10:03] when I started on my journey of
[10:05] justification sanctification to the
[10:06] baptism and the Holy Ghost he took that
[10:09] desire of the tobacco away from him
[10:11] chewing
[10:12] tobacco but now the next day the next
[10:14] two days the next three days they were
[10:16] you know you get around a bunch of
[10:17] smokers and you don't have a cigarette
[10:19] what's the first thing a smoker does
[10:21] want some want some yeah cuz you don't
[10:23] have one you're not with you know you're
[10:24] not with them you know so oh you need a
[10:26] cigarette you know no well see that my
[10:29] buddies would say hey you you don't have
[10:31] a dient in your mouth you need you need
[10:33] no I don't want it anymore had no desire
[10:35] for that
[10:37] anymore and and really folks that is in
[10:39] justification and sanctification that's
[10:41] not in the baptism of okay all these the
[10:44] unclean Spirit goes out at
[10:46] sanctification and I want y'all to pray
[10:48] for me because in the next few weeks I
[10:50] got to go do a Minister's meeting and
[10:52] this is what I got to do the subject do
[10:54] the subject on is what happens to the
[10:57] soul the red emptive process of the soul
[11:01] of man so I'm going to really have to uh
[11:04] put a lot in about an hour's worth of
[11:07] speaking to a bunch of
[11:08] ministers and I'd rather speak to a
[11:10] bunch of Sinners
[11:12] sometimes that's on the internet so
[11:14] that's
[11:15] okay I
[11:17] had daddy would too and all the other
[11:19] preachers if you're real honest you'd
[11:20] rather preach the center sometimes than
[11:22] a bunch of
[11:23] preachers brother Brown said the most
[11:25] problem he ever had was with what
[11:27] preachers right preachers are the
[11:30] problem and it's true preachers are the
[11:32] problem because you know what like me
[11:33] and Daddy were're talking about Friday
[11:36] night your pastor is right here and you
[11:39] can't go no higher than your pastor now
[11:41] if your pastor is right
[11:43] here you can forget going any higher
[11:45] unless you go somewhere else that's
[11:48] right do you understand that brother
[11:50] rown said you cannot and some of you
[11:52] have come from other places to hear
[11:55] knowing that your pastor was just at a
[11:57] certain spot and he was at that spot and
[12:01] you were at that spot okay so we must
[12:04] seek someone that's own up a little
[12:06] higher because remember Peter had Peter
[12:09] couldn't come down here on the day of
[12:12] Pentecost and just start with first
[12:15] Peter or second Peter add to your faith
[12:18] virtue but no he kept growing in Grace
[12:21] and knowledge and then in second Peter
[12:23] he comes forth and says having the
[12:24] divine nature of God add these things to
[12:26] you okay so it's a journey
[12:29] excuse me same way with brother brandham
[12:31] brother brandham had to come to the
[12:32] stage of adoption
[12:34] because only the Lord Jesus had come to
[12:37] that place and for us to become adopted
[12:39] there has to be the word has to be open
[12:42] right so that we can receive that word
[12:45] because really I think most people in
[12:47] the message think that it's just going
[12:48] to be and I've always told you this that
[12:51] I think people go well the Lord's coming
[12:54] right here right
[12:57] yeah and that's when he's coming no if
[13:01] he's coming on that day everybody's
[13:03] going to be ready right there at that
[13:08] day God didn't pick a day to come back
[13:12] for the Rapture for the for the body
[13:14] change God didn't pick a day brother
[13:16] Brown didn't say if we're waiting on the
[13:18] day that God's coming back he said God's
[13:21] waiting on the read of the
[13:23] Bride so he knows the bride's going to
[13:25] get ready on that day right and that's
[13:27] next Thursday for most of you that want
[13:29] to know get
[13:32] ready before the festival wait it's
[13:34] actually the Hindu festival of
[13:37] lights so anyway that's what it's but no
[13:41] just tell but but there's no red letter
[13:43] day on God's calendar so he's waiting on
[13:45] us to come to a place then he's going to
[13:47] come he's going to come because we're
[13:49] ready he's not going to come before he's
[13:51] going to come when that last
[13:54] one and I don't like that word comes in
[13:57] cuz there people come in these people go
[14:01] out when
[14:05] theom but when they come in and
[14:08] stay when the last one has made herself
[14:11] Rich when the last one has been birthed
[14:14] into the body of Christ when the because
[14:16] remember and don't get me wrong I don't
[14:18] know why I'm talking about this but
[14:19] we're going to talk about it anyway
[14:21] everybody's waiting for somebody to come
[14:22] from out there on the street come in to
[14:24] be the last
[14:26] one some of you me clude it could be at
[14:29] sanctification and been that way for 10
[14:32] years and one day God will strike that
[14:36] give me the new birth and I'll be the
[14:38] last one who will be gone cuz he's not
[14:40] going to bring a baby in and then leave
[14:42] him out of here cuz if not they got to
[14:43] die that's right right you understand
[14:46] what I'm saying if not they got to die
[14:48] real quick and then be resurrected back
[14:50] up and that can happen cuz that happened
[14:52] to
[14:54] the to the
[14:56] um the faith on the cross you know
[14:59] he wasn't in Paradise I mean he wasn't
[15:00] dead long he was in parad went paradise
[15:02] and then he went up with Jesus but um
[15:06] and that can happen but I don't want it
[15:07] to happen that way we want it to be that
[15:11] that we come in we get born again and we
[15:12] become a body and then we look for the
[15:15] last one and I don't look for the last
[15:16] one out there Jun and I were talking
[15:17] about coming down the road about U our
[15:20] church doesn't do a lot of Outreach
[15:22] community outreach we don't we just
[15:24] don't do that but people come in here
[15:26] and I want to get these people birthed
[15:30] okay brother Brown said be salty yeah be
[15:33] salty and it'll draw them in okay but
[15:36] you know we're compelled to uh to
[15:40] sometimes go out in the highways and
[15:41] byways and and the hedges and all that
[15:43] and compel them to come in but I believe
[15:45] that's those people right there you see
[15:48] that big old long list of people that's
[15:50] some people that are kin to me and kin
[15:52] to you and their your family we're going
[15:55] to compel them to come in okay cuz I
[15:58] want them to make it I ain't selfish but
[16:00] I want my kids to make it I want your
[16:02] kids to make it but I want my kids to
[16:04] make
[16:05] it but you got to have you you got to
[16:08] have somebody you can't what I'm saying
[16:10] is you can't come to adoption on your
[16:12] own that's
[16:15] right you can't you can't do that
[16:19] there's a plan and a purpose of God that
[16:21] brings us through this statue of perfect
[16:22] man which makes it one of the most
[16:24] important to me one of the most
[16:25] important things that is so ill taught
[16:27] well you you just get everything when
[16:29] you
[16:31] believe I don't you know I don't see
[16:33] that uh Peter didn't get everything when
[16:36] he got he got the Holy Ghost on the day
[16:38] of Pentecost and he didn't jump out and
[16:40] say all right now you got to add to your
[16:42] virtue knowledge no it was a few years
[16:44] he went
[16:45] through now he might have had virtue
[16:47] Silver and Gold Have I None and all
[16:48] those things but he had to come to a
[16:50] place where God quickened those virtues
[16:53] and he could put them in the Eternal
[16:54] Word of God Amen there was a time there
[16:58] was a growth period in there and that's
[16:59] where all of us we got a growth period
[17:02] That's why that we don't need don't need
[17:04] to be LAX because we've had 50 years to
[17:06] try to get into this growth period and
[17:08] and you know we've stuned our
[17:11] growth we stuned our growth by what we
[17:13] eat Ain that right it why would brother
[17:18] have to preach a whole sermon on just
[17:20] the stature of right if it wasn't
[17:23] important then you can see though as he
[17:25] goes past that and you look into excuse
[17:29] me Church AE books talking about
[17:30] overcoming I believe that this message
[17:32] helped him see where he
[17:35] was yes yeah cuz if he if he wasn't if
[17:39] he was here and preaching to
[17:41] us all this see he
[17:44] couldn't he couldn't give you the The
[17:46] Headstone
[17:48] right it's not been revealed to him
[17:52] right um Martin
[17:54] Luther great Martin Luther started the
[17:57] Reformation
[17:59] but I doubt now listen I doubt that he
[18:03] ever taught on the statute of a perfect
[18:06] man cuz he didn't need it they didn't
[18:08] have to come to adoption in Luther's
[18:11] age okay
[18:13] yeah because adoption puts you at a
[18:16] place to where God can give you the
[18:19] ability to do the speaking give you the
[18:23] ability uh that's why I don't it's not
[18:25] going to be a it's not going to be it's
[18:27] going to be a colle leaving out of here
[18:29] but it's not going to be a collective
[18:30] Revelation it's an individual Revelation
[18:33] with God sitting in this room today they
[18:36] could be every how many people 20 or so
[18:39] people we could be in all different
[18:41] levels right but if you put yourself in
[18:45] a place to
[18:46] grow go to the right restaurant and I'm
[18:49] not saying here's the right place to be
[18:51] but I'm saying I feel that this is the
[18:53] right place to be because we got
[18:54] somebody we got teachers preachers all
[18:57] of us have a mindset like when we we're
[19:00] preaching down to brother Matthews
[19:01] remember after the service he said this
[19:03] is what we have to come to I wasn't
[19:05] preaching on statute perfect man at that
[19:08] point I was preaching on adoption in
[19:11] stages well see that's our call in the
[19:12] end time is to not to just adopt
[19:16] men there's more sisters in here than
[19:19] there are
[19:20] men is to adopt you so that
[19:23] you have the ability to speak in God's
[19:27] step
[19:30] cu the son of man is not just a man made
[19:33] you know son of man it's God made flesh
[19:37] God in human flesh not God in a man or
[19:41] God in just men right because remember
[19:45] remember what I said throw all of us
[19:47] into the feminist part because we're all
[19:48] feminist in the body of Christ so we all
[19:50] have feminine traits when it comes to
[19:52] Jesus Christ being our head okay brother
[19:56] please no I was just want to mention
[19:58] that
[19:59] um some people I've heard some people
[20:02] tell me they they feel like they need
[20:05] and I think what throws them off is the
[20:06] fact that it says holy spirit top they
[20:09] think that they need to get to that in
[20:11] order to get the Holy Spirit and a lot
[20:14] of people teach it like this yeah yeah
[20:17] well they just well they physically turn
[20:19] it over and and they think and they
[20:21] think by the way that it's at that
[20:23] point when they get
[20:26] adopted which which it is comes at that
[20:30] point but you can't get up to that point
[20:33] without the Holy Ghost working in your
[20:35] life anyway let's go to Second Peter
[20:37] let's let's read that in case somebody
[20:39] wants to question it or have a
[20:42] question cuz
[20:45] really excuse me
[20:47] really it's spelled out right here in
[20:51] the Bible not what the prophet said in
[20:54] the
[20:55] Bible cuz see brother Brown does make a
[20:57] statement see you come all the way up
[20:59] here and I haven't got the Holy Ghost
[21:00] yet well look remember one thing when
[21:02] you're born again you're a what b a b y
[21:06] baby right and the illustration I made
[21:09] at at brother Bray was good grief I got
[21:13] his keys and I he Bob gave me the keys
[21:15] and I handed it to a little boy in front
[21:17] of him that was probably what 8 n 10
[21:19] years old maybe I said here go drive
[21:21] Bob's car and everybody whoa no no no no
[21:23] no why not he's got two eyes like Bob's
[21:27] got
[21:28] he's got two ears like Bob's got he has
[21:31] the same physical features as Bob he can
[21:33] even be a
[21:36] daddy right he has the ability yes but
[21:40] now why don't you give him the
[21:44] key character development he's a son
[21:48] just like Bob's a son he's a human just
[21:51] like Bob's a human he actually probably
[21:53] has more intelligence than Bob
[21:55] had did I say that down there down there
[21:59] I might have said that but anyway and he
[22:02] could have more intelligence really
[22:04] honestly he could have more intelligence
[22:07] human intelligence than b but what makes
[22:10] that boy different from him even the
[22:12] Bible says the Eternal godhead can be
[22:14] understood by the things we
[22:16] see I have not g been given the ability
[22:19] to drive a car until I'm 16 years old
[22:20] the law not the law it's not really the
[22:23] law it's what man has sat down and said
[22:26] look this person has has matured to this
[22:29] spot so therefore they can they have the
[22:31] ability to do this right cuz remember
[22:34] they took the drinking EGS and I'm just
[22:36] use for an example sorry but when I was
[22:37] growing up the drinking age was 18 right
[22:41] then they saw all these people getting
[22:42] somebody made that assumption that they
[22:44] were able to drink at 18 years old then
[22:47] they had a lot of killings and people
[22:49] getting killed and car wrecked so they
[22:50] moved it to 21 see that's man but see
[22:53] God doesn't do that God knows exactly
[22:55] what you need when you need it all right
[22:56] he doesn't change his law that's what
[22:58] David said I'm not CH he said I I'm glad
[23:01] you're precepts are forever they're
[23:03] settled so the same thing with that
[23:04] little boy now why not he's a
[23:08] human why can't he drive Bob's car but
[23:11] we'll all in our brain go he's not
[23:14] mature enough well now God's word is if
[23:17] you're not mature enough to be temper if
[23:19] you still got a temper God's not going
[23:22] to birth that Temperance into you until
[23:25] you come to the maturity that you can
[23:28] handle that power without character
[23:30] right the boy had power he was a human
[23:33] he could see he could talk he could
[23:35] speak he had the power to drive that car
[23:39] but he didn't have the character to
[23:40] drive it now that boy's never going to
[23:43] change in his characteristics Eyes Ears
[23:46] you understand he's a human you can see
[23:48] it looks just like B you got it yes but
[23:51] his growth development now remember he
[23:54] was born a son that's where you tell L
[23:56] you got to be born a son listen right
[23:59] here let's read this real
[24:02] quick verse three according as his
[24:05] divine power now there's only one kind
[24:06] of power of God and that's divine all
[24:09] right I'm sorry second chapter first
[24:13] verse second pet second Peter 1 Chapter
[24:16] I'm trying to hurry because it's almost
[24:18] time to leave verse three according as
[24:20] his divine power hath given unto us all
[24:23] things that pertain to life see we're
[24:26] talking life lessons here and godliness
[24:29] now how can you be Godly without being
[24:30] born again cuz look through the
[24:33] knowledge of him that ha called us to
[24:35] glory and virtue whereby are given to us
[24:37] exceeding great and precious promises
[24:39] that by these you might be partakers of
[24:41] the divine nature now he hadn't started
[24:43] in the in the in the virtues yet but you
[24:47] got to have the divine nature of God
[24:49] before he starts into the virtues now
[24:51] what is the divine nature of God the new
[24:53] birth right your old nature is not
[24:56] Divine there's nothing about you divine
[24:58] without God okay so Paul Peter's telling
[25:01] us right here you might be partakers of
[25:03] the divine nature look having escape the
[25:06] corruption that is in the world through
[25:07] lust and besides this there's the key
[25:10] right there exactly those three words
[25:12] and beside this what beside the new
[25:14] birth that you have
[25:17] now right and beside this giving all
[25:20] diligence in other words you got to go
[25:21] to work you got to
[25:23] overcome add to your faith see he starts
[25:25] then in the virtues besides this read
[25:27] them there
[25:28] brother L read them that those three
[25:29] words and besides this what Peter saying
[25:32] you got to have the new birth and
[25:33] besides this divine nature this is what
[25:36] you got to have very simple in scripture
[25:39] if you'll break it down and besides this
[25:42] and besides this if this is what Peter's
[25:45] talking about and besides this
[25:49] add all
[25:51] right so there's the answer there we
[25:53] better go Richard Marlo's going to give
[25:55] me a look that being born again
[25:58] that's right being being born again
[26:01] being right right
