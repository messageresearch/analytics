========================================

hello please repeat Mommy well it will play again nobody man breaks another thought to my mind but they mentioned the birthdays this morning there was two of them and I thought you said Brother Dean but I guess it was sister Peggy we got one in four years old I don't know how old the other one is ain't gonna say but you know a birthday means a whole lot more to an older person that does a child either the alternates it's your birthday ain't too good you know sister Anna's gonna come and a Canard and she gonna minister of course this afternoon and y'all pray for her we're going to start with a course right get your microphone that's in me planning by the way we've got a little brother here that's been over in Afghanistan amen you know I've seen something on the Internet or this uh Marine had written a book and he was talking about the Brotherhood and how the young men that come back the camaraderie and the Brotherhood that they have over there there's just nothing to take hardly take its place and it takes a while for them to get back into civilian life but God bless you little brother the Lord and this is a song that brother Tom saying and I thought about this this first time I've practiced it okay so y'all bear with me of course foreign foreign before amen amen Jesus God sent to him that's all stand we'll change over the service amen amen amen amen Open the Eyes of My Heart oh yeah out of my heart my heart you see him then see you here pour out your power in love holy holy holy I want to see me look into the word you can be seen that rothine has a word you want to say to us so if you would come on up I just want to take this opportunity to thank everybody for all the prayers here and everybody else was praying for me because it was a bad thing the doctor said that uh when they felt this thing and it was ugly it was really bad and I could have died and if I hadn't had it taken care of I would have died but see God God knew where that thing was at right Satan had it here he wanted to kill me see but this was for me and for you it was for all it was it was partly to bring us all together that we could truly pray for one another sincerely and see God do something now they told me they told my wife that that maybe six weeks my eyes would start getting better well in six weeks I couldn't tell any difference but just I began I was talking to people here and uh and thank God for the cards and telephone calls and the the late at night when he was praying for me I just can't thank you enough you know and praise God enough but now they told me that it would be a six months to a year and he couldn't go further could go much further well I can see if you can see my eyes my eyes is here now this is a miracle you see the miracle is standing before you and I'm wondering how much we recognize it in America more than one Miracle's here but there's a miracle standing here I saw when I went over to see brother Tom when he was in the hospice I couldn't hardly stand up and back and forth during the service I I had trouble doing that but I still don't learn but I've seen him for hours stood there that's right so I'm and God was trying to show people he is a healing hand is his miraculous hand man and and I don't I don't know if I can I can get it out but it fit to me perfectly what Brother Sam preached this morning I can see this through my whole experience in Christian experience and I've had many things but God says I'm the Lord thy God that delivers you out of them all right so here she has a miracle but now I wonder how many really believes that and sees that for what it is but I just wanted to I I knew it was time because he he said you put it all flowing up I'm still having trouble stuttering and get my brain so your brain has to recompute with your mouth I'm still having trouble with that but it's on its way I had trouble walking having my eyes and my feet together but I'm walking so so I'm just I just want you I want the church to know that none of this this being a priest is in vain because if it was just me and I know there's many of us but if it was just me I see the hand of God in the word of God and we know we never know all things worse to get to the good to together to them see what I'm saying but it all works together to the good of them that love the Lord which are called according to his purpose all right so he's straighten that out and God bless you on um see him come on scene and he said he'd do it he promised it so we see him doing it and then we can't say well there's nothing going on because I believe there is the lovely things is going on Amen I appreciate that testimony yeah I mean if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Ephesians 1 where we've been reading and then we'll go to Romans 8. and just remember now that the Lord willing brother for cash will be with us on the 15th of June that's on a Wednesday and I think that's the time sister is going to be gone and things are taking place but anyhow I'll take care of him might go to my I feed him and we appreciate sister Gail too for fixing bringing the flowers and things of course we really appreciate it and you said this morning we appreciate all of the all of the men the women and everything around the world that have are serving in the military and the things to keep us free that we can have the opportunity the coach had they not been there so you would say well I don't like it because well if they hadn't been over there they'd be over here right so we thank God for that part you know that it stays over there until you know we we can get out of here ourselves but we appreciate it appreciate you know your thoughtfulness and I'm sure brother Dean does about you praying for him and you know and visiting him and and the main thing's praying for him amen oh that's what that's what'll take care of all things see we're not to I have a little thought coming behind this but let's don't let's don't look over the Simplicity of God trying to find some way you remember the prophet said look at the blade of grass you find God it's a simple thing simple thing with y'all you know in their thinking and find God you know so the child should lead them so that's just think about it in that and it's you know I know one of these days I get around to preaching on it but we just appreciate it let's pray and just remember all of these we're waiting them on the way home this afternoon after the service and remember all the little ride around the world because we're all together in one thing getting ready to get out of here father we thank you we love you thank you for your testimony to our brother our Lord because we were all witnesses to these things and all that the doctors would be saying but then we believe that you are the Healer you take care of things you do it in your ways and and all Lord you could do it by just instantly taking away with the prophet of God said that would not bring the faith to us that sometimes of God just you're just allowing us to go through things you know to where we can come forth as a witness see that way then man can't deny what's taking place we love you and we thank you as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts now forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us guide us in Jesus name yeah Ephesians one and then we'll go to Romans 8. blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto adoption now remember this is our day then predestinated unto adoption this today all right predestinated unto the US unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in thee beloved now we'll go back to Romans 8. we'll start in verse 18. for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed were in US see not just to say reveal this will be revealed in us are really not even to us right that's fine but being revealed into us all right watch what he said for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God if you've got a Scofield bible you go over in the middle to your little o and it says the unveiling the unveiling of the sons of God for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption glorious Liberty of the children of God you may be seated the Lord that is Basin to the to the reading of the word now we're trying to bring this adoption that we've been talking about into you know the placing and getting into the right place and you know someone pick up just just one message and they hear it I don't want you to get confused you know because I know what the prophet has said we've given those quotes at previous times and we will keep giving it that your adoption is different from your birth and we know that we understand that but then he would turn around and talk about the new birth and and bring it in and we're you know we're just trying to bring it in a way to to get an understanding so we we're using it as we have many times even back many many many years ago probably 40. uh talking about the adoption in stages to where that we can have an understanding of like the first identity of the Lord Jesus on the River Jordan and then the recognition of the fact that when he came to the amount of transfiguration experience and then going on to and the change of the body so that it would be taught in that way or in a progressive understanding you know growth developments uh all of those words to try to get a better understanding of what we're talking about but we read here where it says that you know the earnest expectation of the creature waited in other words the creation just the translations are which means everything you know the animals the world the mankind the the situations and it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God now as I said this morning is the world waiting to come to an end is the animals waiting for a great destruction to wipe out you know the existence of things on the earth like it will come one day I don't think that's the understanding to you if it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and I I know I've given a quote not well find it for you see it's waiting for the time to deliver nature Nature's not groaning to be destroyed the world animals Etc everything's not one wanting to be destroyed it's wanting to be delivered that's right see and let's watch to take place in the last days but then you've got to remember to keep it in the right order that it will only be just for a short period of time and then the world and all creation will be destroyed right Armageddon will take place and things will be transpiring but the point that the Bible is saying is it's waiting for the time to deliver in other words this is a key thing all right the the time that we're talking about now is to me that the key that the whole Bible is tied into the place the position the the doings the were that in this manifestation of the sons of God it will be a time to deliver nature and that would be the most valuable or most important thing because now listen we've had the message we believe that that's why I keep emphasizing recognizing your day the prophet said and its message we recognize the message that the prophet brought we believe that but do you recognize that this is your day see Martin Luther had to recognize that the attack was his day and when he did he was able then to protest the Catholic church and the people believed it but do we recognize this is our day what is our day we say well our day is the day of the change of the body amen now that will take place one day but that's not what the world's waiting on to change of the body right you know that's not creation waiting so it doesn't just say that the children of God are waiting for it says creation which means world and Cosmos the animals the trees the nature is waiting to be delivered all right and see in doing that then you know we are the ones that it's looking for so it's not saying that the world is waiting for for Malachi 4 but around to come that we know and believe that if he hadn't to come we wouldn't have what we have right exactly right but just put the emphasis in the right place the emphasis in the Bible place and what we're talking about is if these if we do not become the Sons and Daughters of the Living God in the basis of what the Bible is talking about in that position of manifestation of making him known where he can make us known then there is no hope for anybody that's right because those that have one owner grown and crying waiting for us he said well I just don't see anything going on well open your eyes wake up please we're looking for something as we said instead of Looking Backward or instead of looking forward let's just say where we're at because we can't do anything about we believe what took place and we look for something to happen but we we're here and you know tomorrow will be today right that's right because that's why the Bible says today is the day of salvation it moves it's with who so when tomorrow comes we'll be looking back to today as history okay all right and another day to come all right but see this state where we're at in seeing that what the world is waiting on as I said if you've got your Scofield bible you look there in the Middle with a little circle around it showing that he's giving you the understanding of what the world is waiting for the unveiling of the sons and daughters now it just said sons of God so I hope the sisters don't get upset and say Well it don't say nothing about the women you know but that's just the way the Bible's written right right see it's the Sons and Daughters of the Living God because I believe you sisters have just as much right to speak the word as we do that's what I I've been kind of you know ridiculed a little bit made by some people for believing it but I believe that Adam was there could name the animal that's right but he couldn't bring a baby whether it come right or wrong he couldn't bring it all right and he couldn't have brought it if it hadn't you know if the sin hadn't happened he couldn't bring it that's what Eve would put there for she had her part she would go equaling him there until the fall came all right but she keeping it in the right order to where that we can understand all right we preached about that you know that the prophet of God said that what is the manifestation he says to making known me all right I've tried to explain that emphasize the point that if we make him known by preaching teaching talking the sisters talking to one another are you talking to your children are you you know all the whole thing of Christianity is we make him known all right and to see then he may trust them by signs and wonders and by things taking place all right see then that way it's the the understanding that the world is waiting on you and I to make it known now I hope you follow me because it doesn't say that the prophet of God was for the perfecting of the Saints according to my Bible it says the faithful Ministries for the perfecting of the same but there's one thing for certain you click it off on your internet but don't listen to this before you click it off you know hear it and one thing for certain you and I no preachers none of us wouldn't have had anything had the problem if he hadn't a problem right so the emphasis goes wrong and you know where he's at he's in the body of Christ Ministry because he could fulfill any part of the faithful Ministry in his doing because of the word he was at so when I say the five full ministry I'm talking about him when I'm talking like brother Adam said he said the 5-4 ministry he said they said will the bride have a Ministry he said sure she consists of Apostles prophets evangelist pastors until so that's what she consists of that's right because all around the world there's people that are you know depending on the ministry to break down the prophet's message we don't have to explain it but break it down speak on it and long enough to the Holy Spirit can explain amen and to where we can get into revelation of it all right see then that's what the world is waiting on waiting on you and I to find our place all right you said well we've been doing we've been talking about these things for 40 years yeah but they're coming to pass too and it's been coming to pass that's what my emphasis has been lately on not to say something to come or something that has been it's looking to what's taking place now amen you say well well I just don't see nothing well then you're blind nice you wouldn't say anything when Jesus was dying come on how long could we stand and talk about brother Brown and what he would say about the Apostle Paul said it sure didn't look bad in the days of Paul when he come to the end of his ministry that he was down in jail didn't even have a coat to stay warm with had to send a brother after it or tell him to bring it with him a physician that where he used to be and just speak and people would die and things would happen because it's against him or if it would heal you know the sick was healed but said his last days he's sitting down in the jail saying I'm cold bring him a coat but you know that's one brother random city looked up and he said death where's your sting when he was fixing to get his head cut off wow see the way we look at it Paul order walked up to that old Guillotine or what it was and just laid down there and said follow no guilty and go and just stop and stop we'll bring in a guy with a knack he just stops you know see that's what we think it ought to be but no God had a plan Paul was working as we said this morning all things worked good look at the Lord Jesus in the life of his ministry look at brother Branham right now more personal to where we can understand look at him in the last days of his ministry when he used to preach to 500 000. he used to preach to a thousand maybe two thousand five thousand in his last days he may be 25 in a little old trailer out there and he came down to the spoken word right and how many accounts do you have that he told of of the spoken word come on it was only what five times maybe seven or whatever you call it 20 if you want to call it 50 if you want to call him no problem what I'm talking about it looked like the greater part of brother Brown's Ministry was in his early Ministry when he would just simply stand there and say I take every Spirit under my control and demons are just leaving and sick with Hill the dead was raised and the shawl kind of thing you see we look at it wrong don't we so let's just don't miss this one all right because we can't afford it all right but see what I want to do is just give you we read in the Bible that the whole creation the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the Son of God I'd like to read that to you from the original translation this is from the the original dyed lot now all right which is translated straight over into English the original dialogue says for the earnest desire of the creation the revelation of the sons of God look for now that's the original translation so what do you understand it for the earnest desire of the creation the revelation of the sons of God look for dude that's what everything's looking for the revelation of the sons of God all right see myself what is this saying the making known of the sons of God now I emphasize again we can't do anything but if we make him known he will make us not all right now this is the making known of what the bride of Christ right but what is that the making known of Jesus Christ in his bride you agree yes all right so what are we looking at now Strong's gives you the definition of manifestation and it says revelation be revealed to lighten that doesn't mean you know to flatten your load that means to lighten up you know to illuminate or bring into view it means manifestation it means coming I thought we were looking for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and I thought he had to come here before we could go there all right it means appearing that's what manifestation means a period I thought we believed that he would appear in last days and at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ I thought we were in the scriptures to believe it but what it means too it means to lay something bare you know it means to to actually make something naked the word manifestation that actually means to make something to lay it back or to to actually to make it naked you said well why would it be doing that see because what it's doing is bringing it out from Undercover you understand see when you bring something out on from out from undercover you lay it back you open it up right this is the day when the Sons and Daughters of God are to open up enlightened by the eye of Revelation and to open up and to bring God not naked but to bring him into the bases that you can see him right see lay open to the eye right amen the word is nothing to cover naked means there's there's nothing see in this it's probably water I I can't see it I'd have taste it to know what if it would be some way to remove this outside Shale without the water filling all over the place then see I would lay that bear and it would be naked before my eye otherwise I could see it all right all right let's give you some more uh definitions of well let me finish that one Ultra strong it means a disclosure of Truth now manifestation this is out of your Strong's number 602 is going to look it up a disclosure of Truth so I thought we were to preach Jesus Christ instruction concerning things before known now you can use that two ways either way so it wouldn't matter so before known would mean that it was known once before which it was in Jesus Christ are before known to be down here that it means it's coming into a place of Illumination today to be made known right now that it was never known before so either way you take the definition of what what the person is saying it says it's used now manifestation it's used of event events by which stains or States are persons hit or two withdrawn from view me are made visible to all manifestation or appearance see we're not here to adoption as I've tried to tell you is not the the father going off the scene and the sun coming on the scene I've never preached that right the 47 years I've been preaching I've never preached nothing like that because I didn't believe it then or don't believe it now I believe adoption is the father coming on to sing in the sun because that's what happened when Jesus Jesus was God made manifest in human face what will the bride of Christ be in the last days go and make manifest I tried to say that many years ago well no it's the father's going off oh God quote here where the father he just leaving what it's not right all right listen to what John I'll give you some some other Bibles I like them I've got a book there it's called 26 translations of the Bible and I really love to look at what other translators say beside the King James version I stay with the King James version couldn't believe it all right but I still like to read other translations to see what they hold and you'd be surprised sometimes what you can receive from it um taken from the New Testament that was translated or brought forth by J.B Rotherham this is what manifestation or what that scripture is saying are the manifestation of sons of God for the eager Outlook of creation ardently awaited the revealing of the sons of God though the world is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God another translation which is the Epistle of Paul which was written visuals or Paul which was written by W J corn burn b-e-a-r-n-b-e-a-r-e convert just for the longing of the creation looks eagerly for the time when the glory of inferences the sons of God shall be revealed huh good point shouldn't it revised Standard Version more modern translations right so as far as the creation weights with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God the Amplified fish for creation wakes efficiently for God's Sons to be made known waiting for the revealing the distort disposing is closing you know bringing out disclosing my words are sometimes I can't pronounce them correctly but waiting for the revealing our disclosing of their sonship are they holding a pretty good point now Phillips translation which is his Bible you know the whole creation is on tiptoe to see the wonderful sight of the sons of God coming into their own I like to read those because I like to see the comparison to see how they hold a point you know all right and they all was pointing each of the translations and that's all that's given see if it's 20 tricks translation doesn't mean I got to buy a book with 26 translations it'd be like oh you know it means if there's any different in variation in it they don't they give the difference in variation but if every one of them said during this expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation sons of God they don't they don't put that in there because that's already in one doing he's just giving you something where they have different variations of speech right but now listen so then the world is waiting for you and I to reach a place a position we'll come down to that in the message today if you'll watch it real close and you'll see we're running around places the things has to work to be but I want you to just think about it I believe that this is the most special place now this is that brother they have personal opinion I believe if the Sons and Daughters of God As I said a moment ago cannot come to the position of sonship in order they're supposed to be then there will be no future there is no future home there is no Pace no present no nothing right it's all hinged on whether or not we can reach that may not be but two of us you notice I said us because I'm fully contended as the prophet said if there's not but one in Georgia going I'm the one you need another state that's the way I got to believe it all right but that's the way you've got to believe it all right all right so then the world is waiting on you to reach a place well I just don't see how in the world we can well all right we preached out the other week that brought our Wednesday I guess it was or last Sunday whenever I was preaching a couple weeks ago that even persecution I mean it's just past Wednesday persecution is brought upon us for a reason right drive us to a place the prophet of God says what see we talk about desperation right all right boy we need to get desperate well I agree with you but now do we go to the prophet and say now brother Branham what is that the definition of desperation and what is the definition of how we obtain under desperation so he preaches a message called desperation and you know on that message you remember what he said he said we can't get desperate until he brings it to us but he said now whoa listen but he said as much as we've seen of God in his manifestation in order to bring us to desperation see now let's put it all together but everybody thinks it is I'm trying to you know but that's in the same book the same message and but the point is not to just say well will it sit down and wait on God then well these days he'll make us desperate he gets ready I'm ready well now that's the kind of person for 40 years has gone off into and look back and look forward but the little true variety goes right on down the road and no matter what takes place we're still the same people all right let's see now let's get the point you and I are and we are a special people that all the things of life the world Etc is waiting on a Little Ride a little bride to be able to handle lack of words that I could use the word of God handle means you know that you get a hold of something what I mean by it is is to some see it's the not to go in fanaticism with it it's very easy to take a Bible going to fanaticism I've talked to people I told you I talked to a preacher one day and it was a Pentecostal preacher he said I'm not working on commanding the Lord I mean commanding the devil he said I've done that he said I'm working on commanding the Lord I didn't talk to you anymore I don't want to talk to him anymore he's going to command the Lord he might command and without me a bunch of scared of him I just wouldn't talk to him no more why because when a man gets that foolish what can you say you know bad as one boy told me one time he said the end of the world is here and I said well Glory I believe it too he said yep cause him buzzards is laying three eggs I said well would you mind explain it you know what do you mean he said well you know in the Bible where it takes all them buzzers to eat up the bodies he said budgers used to have one but I was delivered with him I used to be around buzzards I've seen them all my life never did go around with us kids we go around the home place we'd find a buzzer so we would like help and generally had more than one but I didn't argue with anyone had me in the head I was just wanting to hear what he said he said that you know I said all them buzzards said they got to have all them buzzards to eat up the bodies okay that didn't make me too happy you know I didn't feel no great Revelation no no thing over it I just and I wasn't laughing at him either oh this you know and I actually heard a person say one time and it was one of them said like this he said in the Bible where it says watch him pray which was the same guy you told me and he said you know what that means I said well I I do but what do you what do you say it he said well watch and pray means you keep one eye open while you're praying yeah pretty good point you know I mean take it literally and I'm not joking now that anything happened all right but listen folks the Bible's not waiting on stuff like that he's not waiting on the fanaticisms as followed this message this went off into polygamies just went off into Millions following people you know and and all like that and around the world and brother so and so is the the man that took over when brother Branham left you know and this that or the other that's not that's not what the world is waiting on is waiting on sincere on his hearted good people that will take the word of God and just simply stay with it when everybody else has to run out one of their owns and do things you know but just keep on being Christians day after day and just keep believing God and just keep worshiping God and just saying well Lord now I'm not making fun of them it's just that's the way they believe you know I just don't believe it that way you know and it's not waiting on something that we think is great big you know that's what I said you see him in the message see and a young guy I'll come along and boy he's got a little um Charisma or what you call it you know Cash America or whatever how you pronounce those big words and and all that people just flock with him this is it this is it this is what's going to take us out of here well then maybe a year or two later you see him I don't know another dude to do it with him and then they're going back where they come from or going to other places see no it's not that right but you see we think it's some kind of a great big thing that we can't attain them to Alice don't make it that way either I thought the prophet of God should a Christian Life was one that could jump up in the Airship Gloria Hallelujah to walk straight and they come down to me that was a great definition just to be able to walk straight when you come back down to earth you know and just be yourself right and that way you don't get all exalted and blowed up about it you just go on being yourself okay all right we get off today but see what I want to talk about I want to try to hold it to a point now I don't want to go over into we're going to read a little about Matthew 17. but I don't want to go there with it tonight I mean today all right we'll take a message on that but what I want you to do is just kind of hold a point right here and I'll give you the emphasis of the number uh one of all your notes the word that you'll kind of follow me in the line that I'm going because we talk about adoption and actually see we've been in this the process of adoption all right but there is a completion of it all right and and I want to see more of God moving and Etc the great things happening right but I realized too that we must wait on him to be able to go forth brother Brown never run out in this first Ministry you know I'm blessed God I'll take every Spirit here under my control I've seen people heard people say that you know it didn't amount to anything but see after a while he come to the place that when he said that he had every spirit in our under his control because he's tutored and trained and brought to the place right but you see now let's get what the prophet and I said don't try not to go up to Matthew 17. don't try to go there as much in your mind and thinking just kind of hold into the life of Jesus and understand that like I said this morning that from the time he started on the River Jordan as we call it there's something like three years before you come up to a mount of transfiguration then there's only like five or six months from amount of transfiguration going on to Calvary all right so then he was in a tutorship for about three years under his ministry and things but what was taking place sick was being healed debt was being raised do you read and let's say a moment ago do you read that when he went to Calvary when he went to Pilot and them when those people were beating him did he just say and they're killed now that didn't happen and it happened we wouldn't be here it looked like he was in another defeat causing being healed the dead being raised and always taking place back here during the time of his tutorship I can't get away from that because see people keep saying well over 40 years ain't nothing been going on I I differ with you 100 a thousand if I could say it or a million because I got all the Bible and the prophet to stand behind me to say it on look at brother random in his early ministry as I said a moment ago heal death rage and things but then when he gets to his amount of transfiguration experience which will place that as much as we can which I believe was when he went so they met the Angels out there and come forward for the seals you could bring forth because we'll proved it with the Bible all right all right but look at the time before then in the 30-something years he was preaching before he comes to the opening of the seals the Earth where the dead was raised the sick was healed Etc of great Mass numbers but when he comes to the opening of the word it seems like it's smaller amount of numbers right right we look at it and thinking ought to be reversed but that's our car of conception that's right but he knew the will of the father and he only done what the father said that's why Jesus when he got up there he never spoke no more amen very little is said from the time he left the Mount of transfiguration Calvary study your Bible very little is said to leave and come to the place you know he wouldn't even open his mouth man one because your father said don't do it in the garden he had yielded himself to where he was under complete obedience and the father never said a word so it wasn't spoken do we look at things and try to get it into some super place that we can't never Attain oh you can bring it down to the Simplicity of life but don't make it so simple until it's like we just fall into it you know it just people are here like I told you the other day people say that I am up here right there at brutally kindness I'm right there because that's the age I was born in um I don't give you brotherly connish that's no more than Philadelphia Thunder this guy because that's what the word Philadelphia means brotherly kindness or brotherly love you go up there and walk down the streets and you have to keep your money in your front pocket and too much brotherly kindness right but now listen let's just read something the prophet said it'll take it kind of an overview then we're going to drop back it's kind of like a view of looking at it then we're going to drop back and then we're going to to be in discovering things about us all right this is from the message hearing him and I would invite you to you've got an opportunity you don't have to study for a sermon you've got an opportunity I don't know really how many message they are called here you him just on that title so you got an opportunity to click on your computer run it up and listen to hear you him for 24 hours a day for quite a while did it take you to listen I don't want to hear you him and I'd invite you to do that then go to the adoption go to Blasphemous name go to the Statue of a perfect man we'll reach up some blasphemians names the Lord will we get time well look what the prophet said here he him 1957 5 19 the the a part of it now I want you to notice what a beautiful thing when this son was adopted the ceremony was said and the people stood by to witness then that father adopting that son into his own family to which he was born now see you're born when you are born again in the spirit of God then you are a doctor who placed into the body of Christ's position see you're born again and then adopted or positionally placed into Christ's positionally and with the this adoption taking place that boy's name was just as good on the check as his daddy's was right all right now that's a place to be reached all right you know we go through life and we you know you can put on your checkbook you know you go down and you give the permission and you put your children's okay on there for them to sign a check right but you see it's because you give them the authority um you've given the authority all right now watch as we go along I remember Miss cash Jesus back then he just didn't do it but miss cash would would sign Hermann cash by mayor Sherman cash you know the bank of I say they wouldn't do it today wouldn't it because her name went on anywhere to write a check they had to have trouble when when Mr Cash passed away to get everything clear because her name wasn't over I went away but you see it was giving permission is the point when a child of God is Born Into the family of God it has certain rights and and things but when the adoption comes it will come to where that their name is as good on a checkbook as the father all right but before we can come to that position you read all these things going down to number two and you'll see thank you well actually takes place when we receive the new birth it's just a message Jesus Christ the same 1955 603 anything that was included in the atonement is the personal property of every believer I love that when a man gets saved or a woman boy girl God gives them a checkbook as it was Jesus's name at the bottom of every check for anything Redemptive blessing that for anything Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for it's your personal property don't be afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven will recognize you all right I say brother dick would get up you know and he would take and say okay now I'm going to pass out checks today well he could take checks and pull them out and it's just a girl said to leave your money alone but he could pass out checks to everybody in the building right nobody can't cash it right that's right well what if he signed his name at the bottom my wife will tell me sometimes we're starting to go to the bank you know the deposit she's sitting here she gets the things I'm going to deposit he says here go ahead and sign a chance I said no I'm not going to sound like that guy you know what I can have a wreck and you know what anybody coming along could reach in there in my pocket and get the check and go around what they want to do wouldn't do very good but you know it probably got a little rubber in it if it got very big but the point is don't sign the check till you get ready to lay it down at the bank you give somebody a check you just remember you're gambling this is truthful he's all my children I trust them well all right there's a lot of children I wouldn't trust all right you know what I mean just be sensible all right but you see when you're a Christian God don't worry about you where are you gonna write a bad check or not that's right amen all right and here's what Rhoda Brandon would say why ask for a little thing he said ask for the windows of Heaven to be open and poured out upon you all right ma'am what you understand see and don't worry about it like the father said one time said and brother Brown actually said it said God would bankrupt heaven and the streets are paid with gold so it take quite a while but he'd bankrupt heaven to back up a check and he told you that you could sign that when you become a Christian when you become a babe in Christ God gives you the right to use his name he signs his name to the bottom all you got to do is fill out what you want I need healing I need Deliverance whatever you sign let me put on there he found it down here that's what he does for you when you're a baby in Christ he gives you a checkbook because he knows he can trust you that you're not going even though you're a baby you may do things wrong and mess up but still he knows he can you know he gives it right to you because the Bible even says he'll give you the desires your heart you know what they done by getting their desires their heart you remember the Old Testament they got their desires of their heart they wanted me you know what happened well they had to meet in their teeth God come down and destroyed like twenty thousand of them or something because they're mermaid didn't complaining so be careful about what you're doing but see God gives that right to it so now I gave you a few more uh you know ways to run around saying it which is Jehovah Jireh 1961 209 that's quite a little off the top of the earth that's what it is when God Saves a man he gives him a whole big checkbook now at the bottom it's got everything the name of Jesus wrote on it at the bottom of the checkbook whatever you ask in my name that will I do right Abraham C believes that just fill out your check and send it in the deposits already made it's in the bank he goes on to say don't be afraid to write the check the bank will pay it off don't be afraid to write a check don't be afraid to ask God for healing see now we go in and we keep a balance because the Bible said don't ask a Miss to consume and consume it up on our own Lush that's right we'll see any Christians shouldn't be wanting to do that that's right I want my daily bread I don't want bread for tomorrow it gets stale I want my daily bread but you know I've never seen the time that he didn't Supply how about you all right so he says the bank don't worry about your bank will pay it off he talks about a ceremony and you know and taking him out into the public that's going to hear you him number four you know 1960 so I'm trying to move up just for her now once 806. he takes them out a certain ceremony as hell for the boys boy taken out of the public Fire and Put on a certain Royal rope now he's coming to the adoption right and they performed the father did perform the performance of adoption and he adopted his own son that he had mourned and when you receive the Holy Ghost that's one thing you're born but now for the ceremony of adoption then he adopted his boy into his family and they had a ceremony and if they'd write checks in other words if that's the way they done it back then which we know they didn't anything that the boy did was just as good his name was just as good on the check as his father's after that adoption he was Heir after the adoption Galatians says he's no different see though he bees Lord of all huh so my point is now trying to just get right in here and stay in this place with me Nora stay in the place between the point of where that we have got the checkbook with Jesus's name written on the checkbook and we fill out what we need and a certain position the to were that it would come to a place that when this adoption is completed in the manifestation of the sons of God or the recognition stage of adoption then we don't have to let him sign his name until we start out ask anything in my name that's scripture so we ask it in his name and see then it's written down huh now then we can write a check sign our own name he said not the head checks in other words now you know what he goes on to explain I may not have it in here but you know what he said what happened back in those days he said they had a ring and they had like a wax thing and you would go in you know to do and you just stuck your hand down and that ring made an imprint that was made your father was okay in you to be able to use that see all right so but now let's stay in between that because if we don't we'll move I bleed too fast and that we will jump up into trying to look at something that's a way out there that makes it to where we can't reach it now let's move a little bit at the time and just understand because there to me is the most important part of the journey the finality of and all of what we're looking for yes but I believe the biggest part of our journey is taking place right now right this is where we're learning the things this is where we're learning the nature of the father because you're not going to give the Signet or checkbook to an unworthy child right they'll go squander it that's what happens to people that's why brother Ernie told us and very wisely he said don't send those people over in those foreign countries a large amount of money they don't know what to do with it he said they'll just go out and buy everything he said send them what they have need of and said they'll learn to use it well wise decision you know what I'm talking about people win the lottery and they get a million dollars or something all right and then just go squander it but we're talking last night and Terrence what we're talking about a neighbor over there that won the lottery and bought a home just passed us now 250 000 house or whatever they gave close to that out of a 500 000 Lottery which she probably wind up getting 350 000 after paying taxes maybe I don't know the run but anyhow and they got motorcycles they got trucks coming in with furniture and they lived in a Danny could tell you all about it but I don't know where they live but she's a cook over there and a little cafe all right and they won this Lottery well they just you know just like Derek said they said well you need it that way here and I'll just give you a thousand dollars because they don't know what to do with it Go free anyway didn't work put it in the bank if you weren't put in the bank you'll be a little easier about riding out right Cody got to work put more back but when it's just locked on you man well that's the way God does God doesn't love it on us right right he gives it according to what we can handle and that's maybe that's my problem he knows I can't handle it she just giving me a little bit of once in a while but still I thank God he's my daddy and he gives it to me you know but see people couldn't stand it give some people the authority of preaching the gospel or a pastor of a church and what would they do with it exactly right like my wife never always saying if Richard says it and she said she said if I Pastor up there I said do I would I'd done run everybody off so that's what she said and that's what Richard says you're arguing them too about it you know I said that's why you're not Pastor smash for a good reason so you know we're not here to run everything oh we're here to try to instruct right right amen bless God if you don't believe it forget it well bless God I remember when you didn't believe it now here's the problem I'm too old folks I've had people right here to come and say boy I tell you I don't understand why that brother didn't understand that what a baptism I the first time I heard it I've done it I can remember the day I started talking to you two years later you finally got baptized all right but you see we all think we're just super duper so that throws it away to a word that the real thing God can't trust people like that and he has to bring as we were bringing this morning what heartaches and troubles and trials what to do to build his nature into us or better than ever look back at he just flooded with things yeah and we'd be a bunch of spoiled brats right that's right so he doesn't do it but in your early night everybody ought to relate to this let's see if you can or any part of your Christian Journey you're bathing Christ right you'd ask God for something he'd just come do it you remember that you remember when you first got saved I mean I heard for maybe a year or something like that six months to the year it was just like you know you were just living on a a world this there was nothing could bother you and something would go wrong you just said oh that's just a trial my Daddy's doing that you know he he just he's doing these things for my benefit about a year later I wonder what went wrong see he just floods us when we first get born again amen he just Pampers us gives it to us and then we turn around one day and we say father I need so-and-so you don't say it fine what did they've talked before two weeks before you asked yourself yes son I'll give it to you then you ask him one day and you just don't hear nothing can you relate to this thing amen and you asked him and you ask him and your father you even begging you've never done that lady I know I know you never begged me he's actually dead say one time he said if God tells me no he said that's just as good as yes boy that didn't suit my old ways of thinking what about you but he said if he says no that means he's right I don't need it well Lord I need this after the other you said you can't handle it and I know hope by the time she's 10 years old she said Daddy I need a car uh what kind of car are you going to give me you don't give no car you might have even bought her a car you know or you may do that with your kids that's your car but it sits under the shed or daddy drives it I want to drive it no no no no no a little more stipulation of this and that you know if you don't make good grades I'll take the car back oh now Daddy I didn't know we had stipulations on me yeah we have you understand you get the point of what I'm trying to say God in our early Christian Journey he just forced things on then he begins to seemingly back up where before we get down and pray and we could just feel this presence and just cry and worship and just and then we get down and pray and we even cry because we can't pray like we used to pray that we can't worship like we used to worship and we wonder as God left us that's child training right that's building his nature you know why because he went through it like that he said I do nothing until a father shows me don't you think he wanted to heal everybody save everybody deliver everybody whatever don't you think so but he couldn't do it do you understand okay but listen get to the place that we can realize that our child's training period is a great part of our life we went around looked at some land one day and we're Beyond us there and the guy that had it for sale or whatever it was came out there and he had no Shaggy her hanging down in his own home looking iffy looking thing you know we got in the car and started back around the road and this ain't been just a few years ago maybe 10 I get we started back around the road and Terence looked over at him and he said yeah I'm glad you just don't look like that I'm glad I don't too what do you mean he said what I'm going to look like that if you did because it won't look Nike well that made a lot of change you know a lot of talk we talk about our children following in our footsteps you know and wondering why they're stumbling and fall and come find out we're the ones are making the footsteps the wrong place but you understand what I'm trying to get to a place I mean we can talk about the adoptions we can talk about the things that we're looking forward to but just remember the prophet said as we read that last one there when you're born then you have the ceremony when you have a ceremony then your name is as good on the checkbook it's not as good on the checkbook when you're young you know starting your Christian Journey right it's when you come to the place that the father can trust you now I gave you a lot of quotes which would be useful in the next two or three messages but see look at down at number five says here you hymn 1960. 806. well that's where and that's just the continuation of the reading of number four okay well that's where the church needs to be tonight it needs to be to a place that God will call you off from work and through his glory over you spread his power upon you adopt you and place you glory into the body where when you speak something happens that's what the church is needing tonight sure we need that and I'm looking forward to that but it's just like I've told you many times that when I first come into the message the statements back then were one of these days will speak the word I made the statement then I still make it now unless you gotta have it before you can speak it oh you just being sarcastic that wouldn't be as sarcastically being truthful because see I was looking at things like this that there's a time going to come sure that he can trust us that he can allow us to write the check and to write our name to it was all tied together in your Christian journey I like to emphasize things through your understanding in mind when brother Brandon was speaking to Sister Hattie Wright have you really read that story when he was talking to Sister Hattie Wright he said you say you know whatever you say I'll speak it behind you he said she couldn't exactly catch it now what did he say you go read it he said sister Hattie Wright or sister he said that's that's saith the Lord she called it you know what because she'd seen him say thus saith the Lord and seeing God healed and deliver y see she needed a little something to help her to believe it because this time he was not placing upon thus saith the Lord because now remember when you say thus saith the Lord when brother Brown would say it when any Prophet says thus saith the Lord you know that's not that Prophet talking now come on right if I if I said now now brother dick I want to tell you something this is what brother Cauley told me to go tell you well that's not my word that's for the college word thus saith the Lord is when the Lord is speaking it but yet it's coming through your lips as from him and this is what God says but it come to a day when the prophet of God said you don't have to save us saith the Lord because it's the Lord speaking it Chief sister had it right couldn't catch that you couldn't catch it when brother Brown said you say it I'll say it behind you I think but he said sister that's thus saith the Lord she knew it then she believed it and she got the salvation of her sons and that's where all of everybody goes and do years ago they backslid what I heard they had nothing to do with it because done been saying amen amen you're still a bit sad that's right brother all right they may have a hard Road or whatever to take place but it's not been said because you can't deny it all right but now listen so just think about it let's see I'm trying to just jump down now so you take these home where you bring back we'll get on to a Wednesday a little bit and I'm trying to drop down to Blasphemous names it's number nine on your notes because I want to tie it together with this there's some quotes in between there that word that is speaking of the fact of how the child can that you you have the right to use Jesus's name pretty signs a check right but then it comes the time to work you sign the check right but you see that's your adoption that's your headstone adoption that's the part of adoption when God comes down and unites with the individual and I'll get to that that's not just a part of your journey that's getting into the climax of your journey Jesus never had a matter of transfiguration experience when he first started he had a river Jordan experience then three years later he had amount of transfiguration experience place it correctly see we we come in as babies and we we get into it and we read a little bit about what the prophet said and said oh look at that my name just as good as his is I've been around and heard these more blessed God we just speak the word what all these predictions all these dates and times and times Lord told me well now the Bible says kill him of course we don't want to be that way do we and we're not well that's what the Bible we read it this morning Prophet crosses out of the line only supposed to be killed that's what they're doing with them back there you know what that done that done away with a lot of that blabbering but see instead of that we call them brothers and they make predictions and then they just make another one and that don't happen they just make another one and all of it is thus that forward Lord told me not be like ain't right this time that's their business that's there to draw off people I started to try you to see what you're going to do about it all right what you see that has a specific position of authority that we'll cover later but when you come to word that your adoption is the point of Jesus Christ adoption on Mount Transfiguration that comes the headstone that comes to those things but let's just stick where we're at here's blasphemian's name number nine on your nose 62 1104 in the morning service do you remember over the Book of Matthew the 17th chapter of the first verse and the first to the fifth verse Jesus on my Transfiguration you heard me hear ye him that sermon I just hear about a year ago preached that become so popular hear ye him the placing of a son in Ephesians 1 5. now watch Ephesians 1 5 we read now watch him he says the placing of a son in Ephesians 1 5 this is why I keep reading Ephesians 1 5. because Ephesians 1 5 says God has predestinated us unto adoption of sun that's for our day and time see a family when a son is born into it it's a son then but that son had tutors to raise it and if that son never did come to the to be the right kind of a son he never become heir but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son was adopted or placed positionally he'd become heir of what the father had and that's what God was doing on Mount Transfiguration when he took his own son after he had been given excuse after he'd been proven to be the right son see and Stuart had stood in Temptations He took him through all temptation he took him up on map Transfiguration and overshadowed him you know in the Old Testament they took a son dressed him in a nice pretty garment and set him out before the public and they had a ceremony of placing or we called it adopting and Galatians start I kind of think Paul refers to it as adopting Sons Now by placing a son ministers will understand the spiritual Bible read and Spiritual Bible readers placing this son in other words the son was a son when he was born now here's where you Pentecostal people made a mistake being born into the family by the Holy Ghost that's right but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right tutor going over still part of number nine because that line goes down Blasphemous names that was on page we started reading on page 23 went through into 20 renowned 24 coming out on the 25. and he tells you what they're doing but look down at the now in the Old Testament when that son would adopted her place into the family his name was just as good on the check as his daddy's was yes sir they didn't have a they had a ring in them days a sign Signet and they spit on it and brought around them does a spitz joke that was a Signet that was just a he wore his daddy's ring his his Signet and that was just as good as his daddy's now when Jesus had been or obedient Jesus to God God placed him positionally this is him now remember you're supposed to want you to get now now when the member is born by the Holy Spirit into the family of God and has proven to have these virtues Now read with me that God can see virtue knowledge Temperance patient brotherly kindness and godliness in him then God seals him or places him and that there that's when you see the Sons and Daughters of God so when these virtues are in US if the virtues are not dire what I'm trying to tell you know brought it all the time up and down to tell you to go to the Statue of perfect man study that because see we must have these things right and like Richard said that time he said I didn't know it until I came down here that it's required and around the and statue of perfect man that's required that you and I have these things in this age it's required it's not a a well we make a choice no if we're going to make the change we got a choice we can go by the grave but if we're going to make the change of the body if we're going to finish this situation of adoption out then we must have faith virtue of knowledge temperature patience brotherly kindness and we must have the headstone which is love all right now we'll make a statement and then back off we won't say no more because you see that's why that's been waiting because your profit said the heads don't have to come yet now the disciples had these virtues but they didn't have a headstone so they wasn't positionally placed the disciples was not positionally adopted that's contrary to most people now you're gonna I'll probably get something back off the internet on that that's all right that's what your Prophet said see that's what everybody thinks as I read what he said he said Pentecostal people think well we just got everything when I got the Holy Ghost blessed God I got all these virtues in me I just preached a message and what being born again growing in Grace and knowledge and trying to tell you them things of how that we come to that how do we come to the Statue of a perfect man well I need virtue I was happy give me some of it when you get it if it's that easy to get you can give it to me now I'm not making a joke I'm making truth if it's that easy to get give me some of it you know what you see it's ever individual has to have these things right not just the preacher right if every member of the body of Christ must have these things before The Headstone can unite as a unit now you you're what I said unit which means the entire group individuals can have the headstone but one day it will be sealed as a unit then is when you're going to see the powers of God you say you're looking to the Future no I'm not I'm telling you what's going to happen what's taking place now because I believe I believe look around and how do we look around what do we say this morning how do you try false prophet by the word how do you look around to see who's right or wrong by the word create the condo priest doing all that it's not a state of the word so your Prophet says that when we have these virtues then we can come to a place to be adopted all right but you see it in the meantime we're in that Journey right I didn't get my notes where I wanted that's all right we're in the Journey of a Christian we've been in a journey of a Christian for all these years it's taken all of these years to bring it to the place that we could talk about these things talking about something and preaching something that's entirely different to me I mean sorry about that when I mean talk about something I mean we can talk about it being in manifestation I'm not talking just jabbery I mean that there is a people on the Earth today that I believe are standing in the place and listen folks brother Dale has never taught it and never will teach it to tell you where I'm at because it's none of your business where I'm at except for one thing you can draw from whatever you think it is it's trying to get you to find out where you're at if you find out where you're at I ain't worried about you find out where I'm at just find out where you're at but if you don't know where you're at it's like wave one time was following my father knees what let's see who would yeah pulling these boys down through the woods and and my brother-in-laws are always real good at directions and uh anyhow that got turned around and this little boy never been in the woods and and they're standing after my brother-in-law is trying to figure out where in the world he was at where did he get out you know wait said this little boy said I think it's right over that way and my brother-in-law he was like me just blunt what he said you know you know he looked at him he said you ain't never been in these woods and you trying to tell me how to get out yeah that's the way people are they know nothing about the gospel but yet they can tell you all about what it's supposed to be I swear I've always told you I've got one of my office there's one another Joe's office and probably two or three downstairs and I got three computers at the house but it's the most damaging thing that could ever happen to the people of this message but it's most wonderful thing to do because we can use it in a hurry to find what we're hunting but it's the most damaging cause you've got preachers young ones especially that is I got 200 quotes on that Wrecking order preaching if you've got one that don't sound right you better not hmm look after one that no God could be one word off did you hear me yes I didn't know that he'd be one word off I thought it would have to tie together now I know the prophet May slips of the tongues etc etc I know that so don't go that way just get to reality at one time we've had an opportunity to be able to hear God's word and gradually like I said the other day brother I'm talking about that cat eating that grinding stone I told you that cat eating that grinding stone you say it can't be done yes it can because when he touches that grinding stone one strain goes off of the grinding stone his tongues tore all the pieces but his tongue grow back and I had a while he can get two grains made a while he gets enough corns on his tongue until he can get four grains you know what's happening the grinding Stones going away it can be good to those that have stayed with the message there's an opportunity of coming to adoption but to those that run off after the flimsy flimsy little things of the people of the message in there there's no opportunity so you know what I'm not de-christianizing nobody never have never will they just have to go by the grave I've always told you if you don't know enough in the message to be able to straighten out by the message your marriage and divorce situation you're born by the grave me you always you say you yeah and you anybody here want to say they didn't ever kissed nobody according to your profit that's potential adultery I don't need the Grace Management boards bless God well what about the spiritual side where you were married to organize religion Curt about this Bible convert them to a Baptist Faith or a presbyterian I think we all need a lot of Grace but if you don't know the message enough to be able to free you from that where are you going marriage and divorce is one of the greatest messages or to be preached to everybody in this message to where they can make a choice because if they can't see it by spiritual Revelation for God to show them how it's straightened out they're going by the grave sorry I just tell the truth I try to tell it like it is the old saying knows there you go what do you see what I'm talking about we have had a wonderful opportunity for 40 years right here in this building to hear the word of God that has not been caught in no I stand Here Right today and you bring it and told me we've never been caught by any of these doctrines don't show me all the doctrines are the two Souls the seven Thunder virtue and all the Holy Ghost all the perus is all of the things we looked at them we studied them but we cast them out because it didn't fit the rest of the message amen maybe we have become exalted and going to take care of that because he knows how to whip his children you might accuse us of saying well you think you got it all no I don't think I got it all there's one thing about it I don't think I don't have anything I at least tried to make you available to where you could say you've got something by preaching the message to you because to me that's the only way you can get to virtue is to preaching of the Gospel I mean that's simple to me I don't I don't understand why people don't want to hear that I don't want them deep things I might get confused now like a brother said he said don't go down there and get confused he said what he really was saying don't go down there and find out you already confused that's the point let's Stand Together take on these things I believe we're in the most wonderful opportunity that had been ever given to mankind upon God's Earth that's my brother Randall said if I had any day in the Bible that is this what he said he said if I had my choice of any day in the Bible to be living on Earth what did he say he's not take this time he must have known something about this time he said it'd been great to have been there when Jesus was there it'd been great to been there when Moses and the partner of the Red Sea he said but this is the day the everything is dependent upon this day as I repeat again if we don't come to the place the bride of Christ around the world don't come to the place of this adoption to be finished in the point of the manifestation Sons and Daughters of God then there is no heaven to go to you see you shouldn't talk like that well God's word said who I don't have to worry about it left up to him take care of it amen oh he got rid of it 152 in the red book anybody having a orders open ing I hear not today with the moral maintenance Lord I know foreign baby in Jesus foreign because our Lord let's walk that will bring him here right here for the change comes right here is where we're going to be playing and while they're waiting on you and I know I'm ready foreign foreign foreign I think I'm in my face feel no alarm that's what I wanted to know brother Perry green said brother and told him said brother Pray when you're praying and talking to the father he said tell him I love him all right he wanted God to know that he loved him so when you're talking to the Lord just tell him say brother Dale said for me to tell you he loves you God I wanna I want him to do what's right in my life do you know what that does it takes a death to me but you know and sometimes death is hard isn't it we want to struggle we want to work and do amen we'd ask you for a few of the men if you would because we're going to try to take down brother Mark wants the tapes in the back room of brother Branham and all of the things brother Donnie's already said he put him in the back of his thing and Care at home for you so uh if a few of you will help we have a couple of drills and all we got to do is just take them but don't go down there and start getting nothing out of the rack now if I get there don't get there just just take the screws out and change it over and lay it down and then all he's got to do is just take him pick it up and stick it right back up the wall you don't have to remove no tapes it won't take just a little bit but we're trying to do and rearrange and we're really having to shift a lot of stuff so forgive us if Rachel and and uh Monica would make sure in their room that anything you know that you need to move around or do move it somewhere that's because we're the Little Women that's where we're going to be tomorrow paint and then and rearranging and doing and we thank God for Brother Gary He's come up and done a lot of work and doing to to do things and and it's a little more convenient to wear that Richard's on into the back room now with his taping things but now just remember that when he's in there between services and the things you know don't go kids don't go running through there he is going to lock the doors you know don't go running through that little Park you used to we left it to work for safety we can get out but it's still the word that you know Richard can be a little bit more private in what he's doing so remember that kids don't be trying to run through that back or the doors and all because he's going to be in there doing his work but if you will Monica and Rachel did anything you need to move to get it you know got to set it out if you don't we'll take it down tomorrow and move everything and we'll try to set everything where you can put it back up you know but we're trying to rearrange a lot of things make it more convenient I hope you went down and looked at the bathroom I think it looks real good and go into Richard's part over there that we've got him set up brother Gary has a few more solins than things to make but he'll have his own place to where he can do his tapes and this stuff in a little more private and what it is out there were you running backwards and forth so we don't have a whole lot to do with this whole building but we're trying trophy wheel for some of you men will just go down there and we've got a couple screwdrivers all you got to do is I sit now loosen the tapes and just take the whole rack and lay it down don't try to start taking the tape out of the rack there's a specific place for them each one and brother Mark wants to put him in his basement so all you got to do then is just put him aboard on the wall stick it up there and screw it up and he's got the whole message down there in his basement that he can work out and do it and listen to tapes and whatever he wants to do we appreciate everything that everybody does and all of the work and things that's done uh Nanny and and uh June and Rachel and Lisa and all for coming up and working like everything and getting the water out and getting everything you know to fix to where you could do it and just pray that that tile will just stay to the floor amen because most of you remember about 10 or 15 or not maybe it's been 30 years ago in early now that the guy over here left the water running and we had just put down brand new tops I'm talking about just a few weeks we had put down brand Utah to Dr Church and a heated water came dumped down through here onto us and flooded it well you know the Lord left his stuff you know it could have removed it now this past week we've had two times that we've had water but in Utah you know so maybe the Lord don't want us to have new tile around here maybe we want to change or something else I don't know what it is but you know that's all right I mean ain't worried about it just one of those trials one of those tests to see what we'll do you know and how we will handle it and we pray that we will hand it correctly amen father we thank you we ask you now to dismiss us with your love and grace but never from your presence Lord and help us to walk in you bless the people on the highway the late June as they traveling home or the many different ones back and for for Brother Gary and them as they're traveling and different things and many others that are they're Lord not here we don't know until we pray that you would just bless each one have your way with us and forgive us of our sins we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you're dismissed and everything foreign over here
