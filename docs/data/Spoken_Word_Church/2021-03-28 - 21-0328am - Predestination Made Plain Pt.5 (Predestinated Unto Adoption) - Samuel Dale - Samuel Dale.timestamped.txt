[14:21] brother colley is the only one that is
[14:23] uh still maybe on the positive
[14:27] end of it and all but uh he should be
[14:30] through with it it should be covering
[14:31] all of the things but it's just a lot of
[14:33] sicknesses that are different things or
[14:36] are you know not the viruses and etc but
[14:39] just
[14:40] something that you know in life of
[14:42] doings we don't blame
[14:43] everything on that but yet we still say
[14:47] pray
[14:48] and ask the lord to take care of
[14:49] everything all right
[14:52] now remember the lord willing next
[14:54] weekend
[14:55] wade in june will be flying out to
[14:58] be with brother chris long and them and
[15:01] for the services and also just pray that

[15:05] in their journeys there and back the
[15:07] lord willing this coming wednesday
[15:10] brother aaron will be ministering for us
[15:13] taking the services there so we're doing
[15:15] that all right then
[15:17] next sunday uh it'll follow our lot to
[15:21] where that
[15:22] uh i'll be doing maybe the morning
[15:24] service brother bob doing the
[15:25] evening service and he said it was his
[15:28] birthday
[15:28] so that's that's be pretty good we get
[15:30] to hear him and
[15:31] and get to hear him you know preach
[15:33] about his own birthday
[15:35] so it's his birthday on that that'll be
[15:37] good you know but
[15:38] uh let's see is that all welcome the
[15:41] visitors i
[15:42] write myself a note you know to where i
[15:44] can remember all of the things
[15:46] but if you'd like turn in your
[15:46] scriptures turn where we've been reading
[15:48] from
[15:49] in ephesians 1 and we'll take our
[15:53] thought from there and try to continue
[15:55] on in our understanding of
[15:58] predestination
[16:00] all right how have we come to the point
[16:02] of understanding
[16:03] how did the prophet teach it how does
[16:05] the bible teach it
[16:07] it teaches predestination by for
[16:10] knowledge
[16:11] those who he foreknew
[16:14] he did predestinate all right he set a
[16:18] journey
[16:19] for those he did for know so remember
[16:21] one thing now
[16:22] he foreknew all things
[16:25] so he foreknew everybody's journey
[16:29] you know that's the main thing to hold
[16:30] he he would
[16:32] uh understand and know what would take
[16:35] place and what would be in the hour that
[16:37] we're living
[16:38] but yet uh you know we want to just get
[16:40] into the thought and
[16:42] continue on our our kind of little
[16:46] notes and things so we go to ephesians 1
[16:50] verse 3.
[16:52] let's be the god and father of our lord
[16:54] jesus christ
[16:55] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[16:57] blessings in heavenly places
[17:01] in christ now watch
[17:04] because remember what our heavenly
[17:05] places that's the believer's position
[17:07] right
[17:08] okay all right because that's heavenly
[17:09] places according as he has chosen
[17:12] us in him before the foundation of the
[17:14] world
[17:15] that we should be holy and without blame
[17:17] before him in love
[17:18] having predestinated us unto the
[17:21] adoption of children by jesus christ
[17:24] to himself according to the good
[17:25] pleasure of his will
[17:28] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[17:30] wherein he hath made
[17:32] us accepted in the beloved in whom
[17:35] we have redemption through his blood the
[17:38] forgiveness of sins
[17:39] according to the riches of his grace
[17:43] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[17:45] all wisdom
[17:46] and prudence what now having made known
[17:48] unto us
[17:49] the mystery of his will now what is his
[17:53] will his will is his word
[17:54] so what is the mystery according to his
[17:57] good pleasure which he has purposed
[18:00] in himself you may be seated the lord at
[18:02] his blessing
[18:03] to the reading of the word now we're
[18:05] trying to
[18:07] get a thought and just holding that
[18:10] thought
[18:10] the prophet said you know
[18:14] if you get something and hold it up
[18:16] before the people
[18:18] he said hold it there until everybody
[18:20] sees it
[18:21] all right then move on to something else
[18:23] so we've been talking about
[18:24] predestination for quite a while so
[18:27] it's very easy for us to drop back this
[18:29] morning with
[18:30] company we don't want to lose them and
[18:32] things in what we're doing we're trying
[18:35] our best to understand
[18:37] the word of god that covers
[18:40] us in our day preaching about what
[18:44] happened
[18:45] in the the prophet is wonderful we're
[18:48] that's great we're there
[18:49] preaching what happened in luther's day
[18:51] wesley's day
[18:53] zeus street what happened there what
[18:55] happened in all of those positions is
[18:57] great
[19:00] but how about where we're at to see the
[19:03] hour
[19:04] because see that's what we've been
[19:05] talking about what does predestination
[19:08] say predestination is a destiny
[19:13] set all right a destiny
[19:16] a determination
[19:19] you know a position or whatever is set
[19:22] for us
[19:24] in our do it in life and things and
[19:26] that's what is called a
[19:28] a destiny all right see then that
[19:31] destiny
[19:33] is set for everybody in the world
[19:35] because god foreknew
[19:36] all things so everybody has a destiny
[19:41] you say well you mean ever well what are
[19:44] you going to put it that would you
[19:46] wouldn't believe that everybody has a
[19:47] destiny
[19:49] everybody has a an appointed part
[19:52] because of god's foreknowledge and how
[19:56] does he predestinate
[19:57] how does he set a destiny to be by his
[20:01] for knowledge
[20:04] he could look down through time and see
[20:06] everything that would ever take place
[20:09] in the world if not then what kind of a
[20:11] god are you serving
[20:13] you know i serve a god that i believe
[20:16] that he knows all things
[20:18] all right and in knowing all things then
[20:21] he can
[20:22] set down a destiny because he can see
[20:25] what will take place
[20:28] so he looked down through time he saw
[20:30] all that would be there
[20:31] and he just set that for that but the
[20:34] main thing that he set was the word for
[20:36] each age
[20:38] remember how we've been trying to bring
[20:39] that the word for each age
[20:41] each age has a a part of the word all
[20:44] right you've got the seven church ages
[20:45] and each one of those ages has a part
[20:48] of the word of god and for it to be
[20:51] and to be made alive by someone
[20:54] amen all right so then we look back and
[20:57] we see well
[20:58] luther's done his wesley you know we go
[21:00] to paul irenaeus martin columbus you
[21:02] know we go
[21:03] through the bible of understanding the
[21:06] day
[21:06] and the time and knowing where we're at
[21:09] but what is the destiny for this
[21:11] age what is the determination or what
[21:15] has god set forth for this age
[21:18] not that he made it happen
[21:22] as we consider a lot of time thinking
[21:24] about predestination
[21:26] he desires that everybody be saved he
[21:28] desired that everybody
[21:30] have an opportunity for salvation
[21:33] all right then that desiring would put
[21:35] him to the bases that he would not just
[21:37] stamp it and say
[21:38] that's the way it's going to be no he
[21:41] would see it
[21:45] he would look down through time and see
[21:48] what everybody
[21:51] would do is any problem with that is any
[21:54] trouble with
[21:55] with that or thinking of that about our
[21:58] eternal god who is infinite
[22:00] who who uh you know doesn't have to
[22:02] think things over
[22:04] his first decision is his final decision
[22:07] he doesn't have to change his mind to
[22:08] make it fit anything
[22:10] it's all set all right see then he could
[22:13] look down through time
[22:15] and see what would be and he saw this
[22:18] you know covered
[22:19] he saw all the people of the old
[22:20] testament he saw david he saw moses
[22:23] he saw all of that and he could could
[22:26] put a point there before them
[22:29] that they would bring forth the part of
[22:31] the word for the hour that they're
[22:32] living
[22:33] we're living all right then you come
[22:34] into the new testament you pick up
[22:37] and you get into paul irenaeus the
[22:39] church ages and things you know
[22:40] and as you do then you can see that
[22:42] there was so much of the word
[22:44] for each age to be able to
[22:47] make manifest or bring forth
[22:51] or reveal or are to do all right and
[22:54] they've lived their ages
[22:57] all right now you just think about what
[23:00] we're trying to say
[23:01] they have lived their ages
[23:05] they have made manifest the word
[23:10] that was foreordained to come forth
[23:13] all right see then in that then it comes
[23:16] down to where we're at
[23:19] it comes down to our point of what we
[23:22] got we have the full word of god to be
[23:24] able to be brought forth in this age
[23:27] whereas maybe you know one of the ages
[23:29] behind you could look at something
[23:30] well they didn't have the amount of well
[23:32] that's true they didn't have the amount
[23:33] of word that we now have because
[23:35] we have the finality
[23:39] we have the fullness of god's word
[23:43] in this age i believe that you know no
[23:45] matter how long we're going to live here
[23:46] in this world
[23:47] and what it takes place that ain't got
[23:49] nothing to do with it what's to do with
[23:51] it is to be able to understand
[23:53] and recognize our day and its message
[23:57] okay yeah we believe brother branham was
[23:59] a prophet he brought the word of god
[24:01] unto us we thank god for that
[24:04] okay but now somebody has to make that
[24:06] manifest
[24:08] martin luther preached the just shall
[24:10] live by faith
[24:12] but the people is what made it manifest
[24:15] the pope in them didn't get mad at at
[24:17] luther
[24:19] he was doing fine they didn't get mad at
[24:21] him but when the people
[24:23] begin to rally around what luther was
[24:26] preaching
[24:27] then they begin to get upset
[24:30] see the enemy doesn't care as long as
[24:33] you're
[24:34] just dabbling around but when the people
[24:37] of that age and time begins
[24:39] to make manifest the word of god
[24:42] then all right so we see luther with his
[24:45] as we said a moment ago that
[24:46] then he just brought the part of the
[24:48] word that he had but see then wesley
[24:50] comes along with sanctification
[24:52] and bringing them into those things and
[24:55] as it does
[24:56] there's the word of god for that age
[24:59] okay and the people of that age
[25:01] made that manifest
[25:04] they brought forth into reality
[25:08] what was their age all right zeus street
[25:12] pentecost they had the word of god for
[25:14] the age that they were living
[25:17] all right they made manifest that
[25:20] you know they seen the things and they
[25:22] made manifest in
[25:24] in those days and some of you are old
[25:26] enough to remember especially some
[25:28] listening in
[25:29] of some of the end of the age maybe
[25:30] their timing there was
[25:32] with us getting older you know and you
[25:34] could remember some about the azusa
[25:37] street and the people and the
[25:38] the doings you know of of life and
[25:41] things and how they lived
[25:43] and they believed that word
[25:46] and by believing that word then they
[25:49] made
[25:49] manifest the word of the age that they
[25:53] were living
[25:54] all right see it wasn't up to luther to
[25:56] try to manifest wesley's message
[25:58] no it wasn't that it was just get his
[26:01] message
[26:01] get it right and get everything set in
[26:04] order
[26:05] and that would start the stages of the
[26:06] restorations and the things to come
[26:08] forth
[26:09] and see it would come forth in wesley
[26:11] you know the just shall live by faith
[26:13] then it would come into the
[26:15] sanctification
[26:16] or setting aside of the people you know
[26:20] and then it would come into azusa street
[26:22] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[26:24] the prophet said there's where the
[26:25] people made their mistake
[26:28] he said they got the new birth now i'm
[26:32] going to believe with him a lot of
[26:33] people you know i've even heard
[26:34] ministers in this message say
[26:36] the zeus street was false and they
[26:38] wasn't true
[26:39] well now i i don't agree with that at
[26:41] all i believe azusa street had the word
[26:44] of god for their age and time
[26:46] they manifested their part for their age
[26:48] in time and that's why i believe we must
[26:50] have a part of that
[26:52] it's not to just look back and see
[26:54] somebody else and see what they do
[26:57] we've got to come to a place to find out
[26:59] what is to be made manifest in this day
[27:01] all right azusa street see they started
[27:05] bringing
[27:06] back the gifts the word of god and
[27:08] things began to
[27:09] be restored to the church all right sure
[27:12] they cabbage down on that
[27:14] but that's why god would have to send a
[27:16] prophet
[27:18] in that age and the starting and and and
[27:21] to bring the word
[27:23] of god back to its purity all right then
[27:26] he would start preaching
[27:28] uh the things and bringing it forth come
[27:30] on down through the seals come on out
[27:31] through the
[27:32] entire word of god being made manifest
[27:35] as he was preaching
[27:36] the gospel and see people began to
[27:40] rally around that in back in years ago
[27:44] and and they moved on pretty good but
[27:46] then after a while it's now beginning to
[27:48] fall away because now the people are
[27:51] saying well
[27:52] you know uh brother branham was wrong
[27:54] here it was wrong here
[27:55] uh that's expected to happen
[27:59] because the devil is not going to quit
[28:03] i mean is he going to throw up his hands
[28:04] and say well that i can't well no no
[28:06] no he's going to do everything he can to
[28:08] try to destroy you enough
[28:10] and that's what we should be doing we
[28:12] should be thinking about it
[28:14] and studying the word of god in that
[28:16] realm
[28:17] or line of the age that we're living not
[28:20] to azusa street
[28:21] that's right i'm not trying to bring
[28:23] back azusa street with the gifts and all
[28:25] amen i believe in the gifts and i'll
[28:28] approach
[28:29] the prophet said a church without the
[28:31] gifts would have to answer
[28:35] all right so then we're responsible
[28:38] see if the gifts are not operating in
[28:40] this church then we'll have to answer
[28:42] for that one day
[28:44] because that's what is supposed to be
[28:46] done
[28:48] we don't we don't throw away what
[28:50] anybody has brought
[28:53] martin luther priest of joshua lived by
[28:55] faith
[28:56] he stood on that and the people rallied
[28:58] as i said around it
[28:59] and when they began to rally around it
[29:01] the catholic church got upset
[29:03] oh yeah right amen but see then it moved
[29:06] on up
[29:08] into the time of john wesley and john
[29:10] wesley began to
[29:12] preach sanctification a cleansing and
[29:14] setting aside
[29:16] of the of the vessels and things well if
[29:18] it did
[29:19] then he began to try to
[29:22] uh convert those that were behind
[29:27] and all like that but yet still he had
[29:29] to not try to bring luther's message
[29:32] he was to bring his own message the
[29:35] message he would bring would be the
[29:36] message that would bring the conversion
[29:40] right and see that's what it's to be to
[29:41] me and you
[29:43] the message that we have heard in this
[29:45] last days the bride the prophet said
[29:47] is to give birth to malachi 4.
[29:50] luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 and those
[29:53] things
[29:53] she used to give birth to that well
[29:55] that's our time that's our
[29:56] responsibility
[29:58] that's our destiny
[30:01] we have a destiny set before us today
[30:03] which is the entire word of god
[30:07] the entire word of god to be brought
[30:09] forth in this age
[30:10] because what's going to change the
[30:12] people what's going to bring these doing
[30:14] as i said the prophet will tell you zeus
[30:16] is street
[30:18] sure they were wonderful they've done a
[30:20] done a good job but they begin to
[30:22] cabbage down
[30:23] on what they were bringing and as they
[30:25] did then god had to move on
[30:27] he had to send a prophet with a message
[30:29] to brain all right
[30:32] and see we've got a message okay we're
[30:34] not looking for another prophet to come
[30:36] or somebody to do those things
[30:38] no it's already finished in that realm
[30:40] that the word of god has been brought
[30:41] unto us
[30:43] okay what are we to do make that word
[30:46] alive
[30:48] make that word manifest there's the
[30:52] destiny of this age
[30:55] all right see if you'll think about it
[30:58] the bible is so
[30:59] marvelously uh laid out
[31:02] and and having a prophet to express
[31:05] those things unto us
[31:06] to put it in order that is a marvelous
[31:09] situation because
[31:11] like i was covering the other day you
[31:12] know we read here and that
[31:15] paul speaks of and he says predestinated
[31:18] us unto
[31:19] adoption a great mystery that's right
[31:23] well we baptist we preach the great
[31:26] mystery
[31:30] but you know what we preached it as and
[31:31] it was right
[31:33] don't misunderstand me listen it was
[31:36] right
[31:36] in the basis that the gentiles being
[31:39] grafted in
[31:41] to you know to where it would be a
[31:43] gentile dispensation literally
[31:46] you know and the gentiles coming in to
[31:48] the re
[31:49] receiving of the word of god and as
[31:51] those gentiles become
[31:53] then see the jews begin to get all upset
[31:56] about it
[31:58] and they begin to fight paul and the
[32:00] tangs and their disciples and things you
[32:02] know
[32:03] the the natural jews then even the
[32:06] jewish people that
[32:07] tried to believe they begin to turn
[32:09] against the
[32:11] the gentile dispensation but that's not
[32:14] the mystery that paul's talking about
[32:16] it is part of the mystery yes or the
[32:19] engrafting of the gentiles
[32:20] amen we believe in that it is part of
[32:23] the mystery
[32:24] but it's not the mystery that he's
[32:25] speaking of of a predestinated unto
[32:28] adoption
[32:29] now you've got another word involved
[32:31] you've got something else
[32:32] involved instead of just having the
[32:35] engrafting of the gentiles
[32:37] now you've got the bringing forth of the
[32:39] word of god to where the gentiles
[32:42] are going to make manifest god's word
[32:46] see this is a gentile dispensation all
[32:48] right
[32:50] in doing that then it'll be made
[32:51] manifest in this day
[32:53] to finish it all up and you realize
[32:56] well what if it what if we you know
[32:59] another 40 years 50 years what we are
[33:01] all right but still somebody's got to
[33:04] carry the torch until that comes
[33:06] we've got to carry everything and line
[33:09] it up and if
[33:10] it's going to be 50 years 100 years
[33:12] still that
[33:13] has nothing to do with it right
[33:17] that that's that's turned not for us to
[33:19] look at you say you think you'll be
[33:20] no i ain't going to be around here 100
[33:21] years i ain't preaching dummy
[33:24] uh i kind of think i believe the truth
[33:26] about it i mean
[33:27] i'm 80 years old i don't look to be
[33:29] around here another 100 years
[33:32] but somebody is if time lies
[33:36] all right well see i don't believe
[33:38] time's going to last i believe we are
[33:40] at the time and when the prophet was
[33:43] bringing it about this age
[33:46] is the age of adoption
[33:50] all right see that was what paul was
[33:52] speaking of
[33:54] not the end grafting of the gentiles he
[33:56] covers that later on
[33:58] he gets on over into the romans in a
[34:00] different one
[34:01] but he's covering it he covers it in
[34:03] galatians
[34:05] how the the air is is same you know
[34:08] until he's uh tutored and raised and
[34:11] different things
[34:12] he covers it in uh
[34:15] doing into the romans how that even
[34:18] comes down to the life's part would be
[34:20] the
[34:21] redemption of the body he covers that
[34:24] and relates it to adoption
[34:27] okay peter picks it up and puts it in
[34:29] and calls it
[34:30] in first peter he's talking about as
[34:32] newborn babes desiring sincere america
[34:34] the word that we may grow there by
[34:36] a growth development then he brings it
[34:38] on over in second peter is picking it up
[34:41] of bringing the stature of a perfect man
[34:43] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[34:44] temperature
[34:45] showing those things has to be made
[34:48] manifest
[34:50] here it was not made manifest back there
[34:53] in
[34:53] total reality sure paul and them had
[34:56] those things
[34:57] i believe paul and those brothers had it
[34:59] but they did not have the headstone
[35:01] to come to the church and see then
[35:03] brother branham when he would come that
[35:05] would be where he would be dealing
[35:07] and bringing the word of the truth of
[35:09] the seven seals and the opening of those
[35:11] things
[35:11] just trying to give a little run-through
[35:13] of fights to where we can understand
[35:16] maybe brother russ won't have to put me
[35:19] on the double this morning
[35:20] he has to he has to that's so southern
[35:23] talks to slow the brothers dunker he
[35:25] he just puts us on fights forward well
[35:28] that's that's doing very good again
[35:30] but i thought i was you know that was
[35:33] what i thought i was over in israel
[35:35] and uh this guy that was
[35:38] there he said sam slow down
[35:44] what they were a bunch of people with us
[35:47] were
[35:47] northerners you know in our group
[35:51] i said what do you mean he said you're
[35:53] slanging things of your words is off and
[35:55] said that's a lot of trouble
[35:56] but he said you're you're talking too
[35:58] feist
[35:59] i see you telling me i'm talking facts
[36:01] when them yankees is over there
[36:04] you know they're over there talking like
[36:06] a magpie to what we think about it
[36:09] but uh you know maybe brother russ could
[36:11] catch up okay
[36:12] but listen knowing the day
[36:16] and the hour that you're living
[36:19] is the main thing that we must
[36:20] understand for where we're at
[36:23] all right see keep these notes because
[36:27] i'll need them in the next message the
[36:29] next one coming on
[36:30] to where we can have an understanding so
[36:32] there's you that keep the notes doing
[36:35] all right and and they can put it on the
[36:37] internet to where they can hold it
[36:39] because a lot of times now i've been
[36:40] where i just quote something i don't
[36:42] read it off
[36:43] because that way it can be put forth all
[36:46] right but
[36:46] thinking about it the last message we
[36:49] preached was
[36:50] talking about what is your destiny
[36:55] what is your destiny
[36:59] huh well i didn't know i had a destiny
[37:01] well
[37:03] what are you doing you know
[37:07] what are you trying to
[37:11] uh make manifest or live
[37:16] see because these ages are saying each
[37:18] age had a word
[37:22] they had to fulfill that word all right
[37:25] that's part of the word of god that is
[37:28] the things it was doing in those ages
[37:30] all right but we come down to the finish
[37:32] of all things
[37:35] this is what the scripture says at the
[37:36] end of all things has come upon us
[37:40] all right we're not a doomsday trying to
[37:42] say the lord's coming tomorrow they said
[37:43] no no i ain't never preached nothing
[37:45] like that
[37:45] i ain't never done it so don't accuse me
[37:47] of it i have told you that we could last
[37:50] way on
[37:50] out beyond where we're at now but i
[37:52] didn't try to make that to where it
[37:54] would be a doctrinal idea
[37:55] i was just saying what i believe the
[37:57] lord showed me all right
[37:59] but see knowing that here we are
[38:02] somebody has to make manifest the word
[38:05] of this
[38:05] hour all right
[38:09] so it's your job it's your
[38:10] responsibility
[38:12] men women children whatever it is
[38:15] you realize that you living the word of
[38:17] god is what god has waited on
[38:20] amen it was trying to express you've got
[38:23] peter in him
[38:24] you've got a few of those back there of
[38:26] the faith of the fathers
[38:29] that they could have a great amount of
[38:31] the word of god
[38:32] all right they were always doing good
[38:34] and they were trying to bring it
[38:35] to teach us how to go on and come up the
[38:38] statue of a perfect man how to do those
[38:40] things
[38:41] but there were some things that they did
[38:43] not have understanding of
[38:46] you know and see then that way it has to
[38:49] wait
[38:50] and had to wait until the prophet could
[38:52] come and then when the prophet comes now
[38:54] the word is here
[38:58] see he brought the word all the way
[38:59] through to us all right
[39:02] now it's our job to take that word that
[39:04] he has brought
[39:06] let the fivefold ministry as the
[39:08] brothers have been trying to minister
[39:09] about wade especially
[39:11] take the five-fold ministry and let that
[39:13] fifo ministry break down
[39:16] into just straight terminologies or
[39:18] languages or ways
[39:20] and try to help us to understand what
[39:23] has been
[39:24] taking place among us all of these years
[39:28] and i believe that i believe god has
[39:30] been uh
[39:31] bringing forth his word you know i
[39:34] remember my memory goes back into the
[39:37] 70s and
[39:38] and the things where the when you you uh
[39:40] you know
[39:42] you just uh you mentioned adoption and
[39:45] the people just go oh we don't want none
[39:47] of that old deep stuff
[39:48] that is well i didn't know it was deep i
[39:51] thought the word of god was the most
[39:52] simple thing that there was
[39:54] when it's revealed
[39:58] see we went through those things and we
[40:00] were supposed to
[40:02] understand what was to take place
[40:05] and like i told you in 1969 i was
[40:08] preaching that the bride of jesus christ
[40:10] would be the word of god made
[40:13] manifest the son of man the lord jesus
[40:16] christ
[40:17] in a bodily form called the bride of
[40:20] christ
[40:21] living on this earth i was preaching
[40:22] that then and how much you think i
[40:24] believe it now
[40:26] but knowing too that that had to come
[40:28] forth into manifestation
[40:31] how do you think the prophet felt when
[40:33] he would stand out there and preach
[40:34] those great things
[40:36] and then the people would say you know
[40:38] he'd come to the seals and he'd say
[40:40] now just give me the questions on the
[40:41] seals now because we want to know what's
[40:43] on your mind
[40:44] well you know what was on their mind
[40:46] should we wear pantyhose
[40:50] should the women do this or should the
[40:51] women do that what about
[40:53] water baptism brother branham
[40:56] you teach for lord jesus christ when the
[40:59] bible seems to say father son and holy
[41:02] ghost
[41:03] how do you think he felt
[41:06] how do you think the man felt about
[41:08] trying to bring the word
[41:13] and there was babies and i call them
[41:16] babies because that's the way you and i
[41:18] are
[41:19] every born-again believer starts as a
[41:20] baby
[41:23] we all start as a baby in christ and
[41:25] grow in grace and knowledge
[41:27] i don't care how much you say you think
[41:29] you know and whatever if it's not made
[41:31] manifest it's not worth anything other
[41:33] than head knowledge
[41:35] all right well see we've been preaching
[41:37] these things for 40
[41:38] 50 years when my mind goes back and it
[41:42] did this morning just picking up and
[41:44] looking at it that you take the bible
[41:46] and
[41:47] and read it and see how that that the
[41:50] corinthians
[41:51] you know the word uh for uh corinthians
[41:54] ii
[41:54] first and second corinthians that means
[41:56] correction
[41:58] well there was the church that needed
[42:00] correction
[42:02] there was a group of people that had
[42:04] received the baptism in the holy ghost
[42:05] yes
[42:07] they knew by the new birth what it was
[42:10] but they couldn't go on
[42:12] amen and see paul and peter and
[42:15] all of them john and them was trying
[42:17] their best to tell them how to go
[42:19] on in christ but yet they just well i
[42:23] don't know
[42:24] you know i just don't understand uh you
[42:27] know
[42:28] i don't understand what what he's
[42:29] talking about here what does adoption
[42:31] mean what is it
[42:32] well then you have to go back and
[42:33] explain adoption
[42:35] you have to explain to the people what
[42:38] that
[42:38] adoption was when we was teaching that
[42:40] in the baptist church and i'm not
[42:42] throwing those stones at you or anybody
[42:44] but that's the god's honest truth we
[42:45] were teaching adoption
[42:47] we talked about adoption in the baptist
[42:49] church but we didn't have no
[42:50] understanding right of what it is and
[42:52] the truth really of it
[42:53] we done the best we could do
[42:56] but yet we taught some of those things
[42:58] back there and believing and trying to
[43:00] move on into it
[43:01] but the main thing is to get the people
[43:03] to believe it
[43:05] get the people to see it
[43:08] i keep quoting i always like to quote
[43:10] that because see the catholic church
[43:12] never got upset
[43:14] with luther
[43:17] oh they didn't like it they didn't like
[43:19] what he was doing and they talked about
[43:20] him and against him and everything
[43:22] no but when the people
[43:25] begin to rally around that message
[43:29] oh man they went after luther then
[43:32] because they knew they had to get him
[43:37] they've done everything in the world to
[43:39] try to destroy him
[43:41] right kill the christians of those days
[43:44] and things
[43:45] right because of what they were
[43:46] believing and you know who was killing
[43:48] the christian
[43:52] christians
[43:54] you ever thought about during the dark
[43:56] ages when they just take a woman up and
[43:58] cut her open and
[43:59] and grab the baby out and feed it to a
[44:01] hog and everything else
[44:03] trying to get them to deny jesus christ
[44:05] and you know who's doing it the church
[44:12] come on go back and study your history
[44:14] it was a church
[44:15] church was what was killing people
[44:22] name was trying to bring the truth to
[44:23] him to to protest the fact of what they
[44:25] were doing
[44:26] luther never wanted to get out of the
[44:27] catholic church i've read his own
[44:29] writings got it at home
[44:31] he didn't want to get out he wanted to
[44:32] convert to church
[44:39] he was going along with a lot of what
[44:40] they were saying
[44:42] but he wanted to convert to church
[44:45] but the church wouldn't turn they went
[44:48] back to catholicism
[44:50] all right but you see we're we're in
[44:53] another age another time
[44:56] it's not for us to try to protest the
[44:58] catholic church
[45:00] you know you don't see me get up here
[45:02] every sunday and preach how this an old
[45:04] catholic church is that old mother
[45:05] and that's this is another one it's all
[45:07] of these things
[45:11] that's not for us to preach
[45:15] that was for luther to preach
[45:19] that was for wesley to bring amen amen
[45:22] that was for azusa streets and him to
[45:24] bring
[45:24] yes ours is to take the entire word of
[45:28] god
[45:30] and fully understand it
[45:35] like i said then you say what is
[45:37] adoption okay adoption
[45:39] in the natural is you're adopting
[45:41] somebody else's children
[45:43] you know you adopt somebody else's
[45:46] children that's what you call adoption
[45:47] you go down you fill out all the
[45:49] paperwork you get all of the things done
[45:51] and they let you adopt that person
[45:54] that child into your family change the
[45:57] name making it to the name
[45:59] making them part of the family all right
[46:03] and see we have the new birth
[46:10] the new birth came on the day of
[46:12] pentecost
[46:14] luther had the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:16] the new birth
[46:18] wesley had the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:20] the new borough it was just the age and
[46:22] time that they were doing
[46:24] they had the new birth for their time
[46:28] and azusa street had the new birth for
[46:30] their day the gifts and
[46:32] the things happening all like that
[46:36] but they turned down the word
[46:42] when the word came forth to the prophet
[46:44] see then
[46:46] they stood with him up until a certain
[46:48] time
[46:49] they done pretty good with the prophet
[46:51] until he's preached through the 40s and
[46:53] the 50s
[46:57] began to taper off in the 60s
[47:00] that they wouldn't have him where he
[47:04] would start preaching to start with to
[47:06] 500 000 in
[47:07] india or something and he'd wind up
[47:09] preaching to half a dozen people in a
[47:11] trailer
[47:14] why because people turned him down who
[47:17] turned him down
[47:18] the church
[47:23] right who was against him the church
[47:27] when he tried to preach one true and
[47:29] living god who was the one that was
[47:30] against him
[47:31] the church when he tried to preach
[47:35] serpent seed and things like that
[47:37] and bringing forth the real truth of the
[47:38] gospel of the word
[47:41] who was turned against him the church
[47:45] when he got into adoption like i said we
[47:49] baptist preached on adoption
[47:53] but when the pentecostals got into it
[47:56] they just cabbage down to the point
[47:58] we've got the new birth that's all we
[48:00] need
[48:03] that's true if you want to die and go by
[48:05] the grave
[48:08] i'm saying to you in the little church
[48:10] i'm speaking to the little church not to
[48:11] anybody else anybody else out there is
[48:12] listening on their own account
[48:15] you know i'm not talking to you i'm
[48:16] talking to the little church
[48:18] you see we must
[48:23] step out on this message that has been
[48:25] brought unto us
[48:29] not protest the catholic church
[48:34] but it don't do no good to protest
[48:35] jeffersonville
[48:39] come on i'm not against nothing like
[48:41] that
[48:42] right i'm for the people of this message
[48:46] all around the world
[48:49] but what's wrong the people won't take
[48:51] the message and move on
[48:52] to see what's my what's my destiny
[48:58] you realize that what happened with
[49:00] martin luther when he
[49:02] started preaching to just shall live by
[49:03] faith that was what god
[49:05] saw before the foundation of the world
[49:08] and knew exactly that he would be that
[49:10] and there he stands
[49:13] why don't we talk about abraham and they
[49:15] like why did god choose those certain
[49:17] ones
[49:18] because he could see in abraham
[49:20] something
[49:23] that would be a contact that he could
[49:25] lead or be with him and
[49:27] no he saw in martin luther a man yeah a
[49:30] human being sure
[49:31] had a lot of problems a lot of troubles
[49:35] drank beer and sat in a pub and smoked a
[49:37] pipe
[49:41] that's no joke about it he would say
[49:43] amen if he was standing here
[49:44] because that's the things that they done
[49:46] because they didn't understand
[49:50] john wesley began to preach
[49:52] sanctification
[49:54] the lutherans got upset with john wesley
[49:58] when the people of john wesley's day
[50:00] begin to make manifest a thing
[50:02] and believing in sanctification and and
[50:05] cutting off those things and all
[50:10] the lutherans turned against them
[50:15] are you following me one age right after
[50:18] the other
[50:19] one age would try to bring the word
[50:24] then you'd see that age die down
[50:27] then you'd see the people running and
[50:29] fighting against that
[50:33] being against it see then when the
[50:36] prophet brought the message to this age
[50:39] he was welcomed in the 40s 50s
[50:42] 60s
[50:46] when he was preaching adoptions and the
[50:48] things
[50:49] of the word of god they rallied in that
[50:51] i've noticed a couple of them that i've
[50:53] got
[50:53] were that he was saying uh you know he
[50:56] said that message was
[50:57] a great accepted message
[51:00] of the you know hear ye him and he
[51:04] preached that constantly back in the
[51:06] in the late part of the 50s and then on
[51:08] into the 60s
[51:09] and preaching hear ye him to bring it to
[51:13] an adoptional stage
[51:15] to bring it to the point that we could
[51:17] understand what it was
[51:19] and what was it you're born a child
[51:25] all right but they had a way over there
[51:28] doing it
[51:29] and really if you'll check it you'll
[51:31] find out you're coming down from the
[51:32] romans and the greeks and the things
[51:34] with the adoptional parts
[51:37] but it was perfect for the word of god
[51:39] so paul could use it
[51:41] to explain what was happening
[51:45] and he was the great one to take all of
[51:47] those things and bringing it forth into
[51:49] the ephesians the romans
[51:52] the the galatians and the people
[51:58] that he could start teaching those
[52:00] people the word of god
[52:03] showing them what they need to be doing
[52:07] all right see that's what the prophet
[52:11] done in this day
[52:13] forgive me for coffins listen when he
[52:18] began to bring the message
[52:20] the people rallied around it
[52:25] but when he began to lay it down
[52:29] and teach it and bring it to a place a
[52:33] position
[52:34] that it was something in a life of an
[52:36] individual
[52:41] right adoption is
[52:44] we'll get back to these when we get into
[52:46] it
[52:48] you realize that the holy spirit is your
[52:51] tutor
[52:54] and you know that holy spirit being the
[52:56] tutor it teaches us
[52:58] and you know brother brown says that
[53:02] said see there said god said sometimes i
[53:04] have to kill the people
[53:09] you don't read all brother branham said
[53:12] you don't listen
[53:15] god allowed people to die
[53:23] he didn't kill nobody don't
[53:24] misunderstand me
[53:27] allowed satan to take the church
[53:32] and put it in the ground in isaiah
[53:36] right he didn't do it
[53:40] but he allowed satan to do those things
[53:44] looked like he would run to the church
[53:45] and rally around it that's what
[53:47] used to bother me when i first heard
[53:49] about it and and read like
[53:50] the the fox's book of martyrs and things
[53:53] you know
[53:54] back it even when i was first hearing of
[53:56] the prophet
[53:58] and thinking about how those people and
[54:00] thinking about what i was saying that
[54:01] while ago
[54:02] and you got somebody standing out there
[54:03] and they're they're killing that person
[54:09] and they're standing there saying you
[54:10] deny that god you believe
[54:13] you say i can't deny jesus
[54:17] who do you serve i serve jesus
[54:22] what's the problem you're serving jesus
[54:25] i'm serving jesus i used to look at that
[54:28] and wonder
[54:28] what in the world could people come to
[54:31] that they'd kill each other over or kill
[54:33] somebody over
[54:34] and they believe the same god yeah but
[54:36] you don't believe the god i believe well
[54:38] what
[54:39] is there another jesus yeah
[54:42] father son holy ghost
[54:46] yeah trinitarian doctrine
[54:50] the trinitarian doctrine is what killed
[54:51] the people
[54:58] and the trinitarian doctrine is the
[54:59] teaching of the trinity of the people of
[55:01] the religious world do you understand
[55:04] what i'm saying
[55:06] what would make the catholics want to
[55:08] kill anybody
[55:09] for believing in the same god they
[55:11] believe in
[55:12] unless it be they don't believe in the
[55:14] god you believe in
[55:20] come on they don't believe in the gods
[55:21] you believe in you try to explain to
[55:24] them the gods you believe in
[55:25] of the one true and living god that it's
[55:28] not
[55:29] trinitarianism it's one true and living
[55:32] god
[55:34] they're going to kill you for it again
[55:36] right
[55:38] because somebody one day
[55:42] is going to do it the prophet said it
[55:43] too many times he said one day somebody
[55:45] will stand up
[55:48] so the word the bride will come to the
[55:50] word and as she does
[55:53] says then the world's going to come
[55:54] after the bride
[55:57] this is i told you with this viruses and
[55:59] stuff like that that's not though
[56:01] no no tribulation that's a tribulation
[56:04] that worketh patience
[56:05] i was reading sister trudy gave me a a
[56:07] book to to do and they told in there
[56:09] about the people from
[56:11] uh 165 a.d this away
[56:15] and there's been over 500 million
[56:19] people died of viruses
[56:24] one of them alone was 200 million
[56:28] people
[56:34] you know what most of those done within
[56:36] one year
[56:38] that's according to them no they even
[56:40] give the dates
[56:42] of where it started or it began to taper
[56:45] off and ended up
[56:46] most of them the longest any of those
[56:48] viruses ever lasted was like five years
[56:53] 500 million people
[56:57] that's not the tribulation
[57:03] that's pre-tribulation that's
[57:05] tribulation
[57:06] the work of the patients see
[57:11] all right so you say well let's it's
[57:14] poured out on us no we're not under no
[57:16] tribulation if you are
[57:17] you're under the wrath of god
[57:19] tribulation means the wrath of god
[57:21] poured out upon you
[57:25] it is not because you get sick and you
[57:27] have this virus and you have that one
[57:29] or you have this bug that takes so many
[57:31] whatever that's not tribulation that's
[57:33] tribulation at work with patience
[57:36] that's a pre-tribulation you've heard
[57:38] the prophet in the seal vote get into it
[57:40] a pre-tribulation to where people would
[57:43] die he said
[57:44] i was looking at one this morning he
[57:46] said uh cancer would be like a toothache
[57:52] no well look at the viruses that's going
[57:56] around look what's taking place
[57:58] but it's tapering off now right
[58:02] well how long have you had the virus
[58:08] come on you don't think about what is
[58:10] being said and what happens
[58:13] how long has the virus been in effect a
[58:15] little over a year
[58:16] right now it's tapering off
[58:23] well is it odd then i mean i'll give you
[58:25] the book
[58:26] i'm not trying to promote a book or
[58:27] anything but i'll let you read it to
[58:29] where the
[58:30] that most of those viruses only lasted
[58:32] like one year and then it would begin to
[58:33] taper off
[58:35] and die of 200 million people die in one
[58:38] year
[58:41] but that's not the tribulation
[58:46] tribulation is when the wrath of god
[58:48] will be poured out upon
[58:50] the people but there won't be no prey
[58:52] and there won't be no virus and there
[58:54] won't be no
[58:55] uh go down and get a shot to take care
[58:57] of you'll die right in your flesh and
[58:58] just rot
[59:04] the animals just come and eat right off
[59:05] the flesh as you're still alive
[59:07] that's according to the bible that
[59:10] is coming to a tribulation all right
[59:14] what you see the bride of christ crisis
[59:17] to go into rapture
[59:19] she's not to go through the tribulation
[59:21] she goes through the tribulation that
[59:22] make us patience
[59:23] she has her troubles with all the world
[59:25] sure we're under all of the things
[59:27] that's happening to us is having all
[59:29] we're not immune to sicknesses
[59:33] as a matter of fact the bible says many
[59:35] are the afflictions of the righteous but
[59:36] the lord leadeth out of them all
[59:38] it speaks of maybe more for us than it
[59:40] does for others
[59:42] i tried to tell you when this first
[59:44] started i said this is not the
[59:45] tribulation church
[59:47] i said this is this is tribulation that
[59:49] worked with patience
[59:51] how many people has died of this thing
[59:56] but i'm praying and hoping that it'll do
[59:57] like the rest of them it's tapering off
[59:59] on hope
[1:00:02] because that's what they're saying now
[1:00:05] all right
[1:00:08] but see the bride don't go through the
[1:00:10] tribulation
[1:00:11] she goes in the rapture for the
[1:00:12] tribulation takes place
[1:00:16] but what about them poor old jews
[1:00:17] that'll be there
[1:00:19] even the chosen of god 144 thousand
[1:00:21] they're going to be in the tribulation
[1:00:25] the world is going to be in a
[1:00:26] tribulation where there won't be no it
[1:00:28] will be the wrath of god poured out
[1:00:30] it won't be that you can pray and god
[1:00:32] will hear you
[1:00:36] that's tribulation
[1:00:39] when there is nothing just you scream
[1:00:41] and cry or you want to at least you can
[1:00:43] go get an
[1:00:43] aspirin for a headache but what time
[1:00:46] the time comes when nothing don't work
[1:00:50] then you're talking about tribulation
[1:00:55] it's not supposed to be upon the bride
[1:01:00] so then we were we were going to get out
[1:01:02] of here before but you know what's going
[1:01:03] to cause us to get out of here
[1:01:09] is the revealed word that was brought
[1:01:11] unto you and i
[1:01:12] by this prophet messenger that is made
[1:01:14] alive by someone
[1:01:18] why is it that the the diseases is not
[1:01:21] supposed to come on you
[1:01:22] because of what you have inside of you
[1:01:26] don't mean that you won't get sick and
[1:01:27] things can happen
[1:01:32] but you can pray
[1:01:37] what about a time when it doesn't do no
[1:01:38] good to pray that's right
[1:01:43] he said well that sounds like doomsday
[1:01:45] that is but we're not supposed to be
[1:01:46] there
[1:01:47] we're supposed to be in the rapture what
[1:01:50] is the life stage of adoption
[1:01:52] according to romans we'll get back to it
[1:01:54] romans 8 to wit
[1:01:56] the to understand to wit to witness
[1:02:00] to become a part of a something that
[1:02:02] will take place
[1:02:03] that these bodies
[1:02:08] are going to be redeemed
[1:02:12] the prophet said that will take place
[1:02:16] at the resurrection
[1:02:21] because it'll all transpire right in the
[1:02:22] resurrection change in the moment of
[1:02:25] 2011 and i
[1:02:27] step off this earth why because we
[1:02:29] believe the word of god
[1:02:31] because somebody's going to believe it
[1:02:32] and going to stand on it
[1:02:34] somebody's going to say it's for me
[1:02:39] you said well but i just can't see this
[1:02:41] for me brother well why can't you
[1:02:43] what's your problem that's right
[1:02:50] do we believe god
[1:02:56] see these sicknesses you say well
[1:02:57] they've come among us they've come among
[1:02:59] everybody
[1:02:59] there's no such thing as saying that
[1:03:01] that we're immune to sickness because
[1:03:03] we're a bride of christ
[1:03:05] but now listen you say what the prophet
[1:03:07] said it okay now you handle it
[1:03:10] you got the pulpit come on
[1:03:14] you handle it
[1:03:18] no you ain't gonna do it you're gonna
[1:03:20] all you're gonna do is run your mouth
[1:03:21] when you get it home
[1:03:23] but run your mouth over one thing
[1:03:28] the bride of jesus christ as long as
[1:03:32] that blood of jesus christ is here
[1:03:35] and it'll be here until the change of
[1:03:37] these bodies
[1:03:39] that's going to be there for you and me
[1:03:41] to be able to pray and god will hear
[1:03:44] us and honor our prayers
[1:03:49] but he's waiting on somebody to step out
[1:03:52] he's waiting on somebody to just step
[1:03:54] out and believe it and say that's for me
[1:04:00] that was why i was so thrilled when when
[1:04:02] you began to tell me and
[1:04:03] there i was in the hospital and things
[1:04:05] and saying well the world they've got
[1:04:06] you on the internet they've got you on
[1:04:08] this you're in all of the countries
[1:04:09] we've got it
[1:04:10] brother dale we put it out everywhere
[1:04:13] and they're praying for you well thank
[1:04:15] god because somewhere
[1:04:18] it may not be for one person and i ain't
[1:04:21] worried about it
[1:04:22] i'm just saying it that way it might not
[1:04:25] be but one person that was praying but
[1:04:27] god heard
[1:04:29] that's right well
[1:04:33] and the most of you have been taken care
[1:04:35] of that the fact that you didn't get the
[1:04:37] viruses and
[1:04:38] things and even if he did it's turned
[1:04:42] down into a smaller case
[1:04:46] well maybe it had to strike me and my
[1:04:47] wife where we could stand on faith and
[1:04:49] one thing
[1:04:50] and say we're going to make it through
[1:04:55] we're going to make it through this time
[1:04:59] we're going to pray we're going to get a
[1:05:01] bride people around the world to rally
[1:05:03] around the prayer line
[1:05:05] and pray for god to take care of these
[1:05:08] things
[1:05:12] somebody's going to come what is
[1:05:14] adoption to be
[1:05:17] the natural story of adoption as i said
[1:05:20] you adopt into
[1:05:21] your family a child make them part of
[1:05:23] your family
[1:05:24] all right now see in the spiritual part
[1:05:28] it's you that have received the baptism
[1:05:30] of the holy ghost the new birth
[1:05:34] all right your new birth is not your
[1:05:35] adoption
[1:05:38] we'll read these later on but we've got
[1:05:40] them laying here it's not your adoption
[1:05:42] to your new world
[1:05:45] the new birth is you coming into the
[1:05:46] body of christ
[1:05:48] as a child of god adoption
[1:05:52] is when you take that child and tutor
[1:05:55] that child and train it
[1:05:56] for all of the times and it comes out to
[1:05:59] be a child of god with understanding and
[1:06:02] and then god can take it out and give it
[1:06:04] full authority
[1:06:08] as i said what did paul do paul took
[1:06:10] galatians explains it
[1:06:12] if you want to study adoption read these
[1:06:16] let's see i wrote them read galatians
[1:06:22] especially the fourth chapter
[1:06:26] read romans especially the eighth
[1:06:29] chapter
[1:06:31] read ephesians especially the first
[1:06:33] chapter
[1:06:36] read first peter
[1:06:40] and read second peter
[1:06:44] and you'll see what god is expecting out
[1:06:46] of you and me
[1:06:47] somebody's going to make that manifest
[1:06:51] somebody's going to stand on this word
[1:06:52] and say god is real
[1:06:54] and he's bringing all of these things to
[1:06:56] pass
[1:06:58] and we're not afraid of him
[1:07:02] i honestly can say i could lay there at
[1:07:04] a hospital by myself and nobody around
[1:07:07] and nowhere
[1:07:07] to talk to anybody but yet i was never
[1:07:10] afraid
[1:07:13] there was never a moment of fear
[1:07:17] there was a moment of rejoicing to find
[1:07:19] out that people
[1:07:21] was praying for me
[1:07:26] that was a rejoicing time not a fear
[1:07:31] you see you're not afraid of dying no
[1:07:32] i'm not afraid of dying that's that's
[1:07:34] the problem
[1:07:35] if you're afraid of dying you've got a
[1:07:36] problem
[1:07:38] you need a new birth see that's the
[1:07:40] first thing that we need
[1:07:42] the first thing we need is the new birth
[1:07:44] do you have that
[1:07:46] because there's no need of talking about
[1:07:47] how you become adopted into the family
[1:07:49] if you don't have the new birth
[1:07:56] if you're not born again don't worry
[1:07:57] about adoption it's not for you
[1:08:00] it's like the prophet says that it was a
[1:08:02] child that never proved to be a
[1:08:04] a trooper or the tutor couldn't bring
[1:08:06] that child up to a position
[1:08:08] of you know a adult hood or acting like
[1:08:12] it
[1:08:12] that child stayed a child
[1:08:18] he stayed a child of god
[1:08:22] but he was never adopted now i'm going
[1:08:24] to say this whether you like it or not
[1:08:26] then you're going to see
[1:08:28] the days of martin luther they had the
[1:08:31] new birth
[1:08:32] but could never reach adoption
[1:08:35] because they never understood it the
[1:08:38] days of john wesley
[1:08:40] they had the new birth of sanctification
[1:08:43] even your prophet said
[1:08:44] they had the new birth they were in the
[1:08:45] body of cry but they
[1:08:47] never reached an adoptional stage
[1:08:51] azusa street coming to be the greatest
[1:08:53] of all of the movements of god
[1:08:59] signs and wonders and gifts and all
[1:09:01] working
[1:09:04] but yet they never come to adoption
[1:09:08] like we were talking about the other day
[1:09:10] why why would people be so
[1:09:13] you know odd i never have understood
[1:09:15] this because
[1:09:16] you know here's brother branham i'm just
[1:09:18] not making a joke but i'm just talking
[1:09:21] here's brother branham stands up there
[1:09:23] and he says now
[1:09:24] uh you know said there's there's graham
[1:09:27] said that's g-r-a-h-a-m he said that's
[1:09:29] six letters
[1:09:31] right in the name and said we've never
[1:09:34] had a worldwide evangelist or anything
[1:09:37] like that
[1:09:37] with that ham on the end of it until
[1:09:40] billy graham
[1:09:41] and he thought the world he said he had
[1:09:43] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:45] i believe all right
[1:09:49] and he said here he comes with that but
[1:09:52] said there's got to be
[1:09:54] somebody come to pick up higher and get
[1:09:56] 7 is the right number with god
[1:09:59] well why didn't somebody sit there and
[1:10:00] say seven then now billy graham
[1:10:03] g-r-a-h-a-m that's six
[1:10:05] who's this guy by preaching william
[1:10:08] marion branham
[1:10:12] seven seven seven
[1:10:17] you know that they had his name was
[1:10:19] changed
[1:10:21] brother brown's name was originally
[1:10:23] graham
[1:10:25] his father changed his name
[1:10:30] why didn't somebody get up say who is
[1:10:31] this guy what'd you say your name was
[1:10:34] how many letters in your name i got 21
[1:10:37] of them
[1:10:38] i got seven in each one
[1:10:41] well maybe this is the guy we need to be
[1:10:43] looking for
[1:10:44] no they were still looking for the guy
[1:10:46] they were still trying to find the
[1:10:48] malachi 4.
[1:10:50] when he was even telling them his name
[1:10:51] was telling it
[1:10:54] even showing him mathematically
[1:10:56] everything was correct
[1:10:58] do you think they'd believe him oh they
[1:11:01] believed him while the guest was working
[1:11:03] right sure he was a prophet guest was
[1:11:06] working
[1:11:10] but what about like wade was talking
[1:11:11] about the other day what about when he
[1:11:13] began to tell that catholic church and
[1:11:14] all that
[1:11:14] there was not one whole church converted
[1:11:17] you know what i'm saying nobody no age
[1:11:18] no people got converted
[1:11:21] to those things
[1:11:27] what are you trying to say brother dale
[1:11:28] i'm trying to say one thing church
[1:11:30] somebody has got to make this message
[1:11:32] live
[1:11:35] when are we going to start believing it
[1:11:36] that's right
[1:11:38] and believing it's us
[1:11:42] and accepting it to being
[1:11:46] that simple yeah but i i
[1:11:49] don't believe we'll ever be nothing like
[1:11:50] that well then where are you and what
[1:11:52] are you expecting
[1:11:57] who's going to do it
[1:12:05] could it be that you don't have the new
[1:12:07] birth cause the new birth is supposed to
[1:12:08] teach you
[1:12:09] that you're a child of god
[1:12:13] adoption is not the new birth the new
[1:12:15] birth
[1:12:16] is to realize you are a child of god
[1:12:19] born into the family of god
[1:12:23] then adoption is to positionally place
[1:12:25] that child into full authority
[1:12:32] when are we going to rally around the
[1:12:34] message of the hour
[1:12:39] if not we're going to keep on dying and
[1:12:41] going by the grave
[1:12:43] you can say what you want to but that's
[1:12:45] what the lord spoke to me
[1:12:46] about 40 years ago
[1:12:51] and i never had no references and never
[1:12:53] have any references to anybody or
[1:12:55] anything
[1:12:56] but the reference was the one thing the
[1:12:59] biggest portion of the bride of jesus
[1:13:01] christ
[1:13:02] is going to die and go by the grave
[1:13:05] because they cannot come
[1:13:07] to the adoptional stages that is
[1:13:09] required for this age to be done
[1:13:11] why because they will not accept it
[1:13:16] they've got their own ideas
[1:13:19] like one man said said that statue of a
[1:13:22] perfect man he said
[1:13:23] that's deep we said that that uh um
[1:13:26] ii peter that's simple that's the same
[1:13:28] thing
[1:13:31] but yet to him see that meant something
[1:13:37] what are you thinking about what are you
[1:13:38] thinking while i'm talking
[1:13:42] what do you mean brother dale if you
[1:13:44] think that we've got to become the word
[1:13:47] if not what are we here for let's go
[1:13:50] home
[1:13:51] it's raining out there
[1:13:58] you shouldn't be like that well why
[1:14:02] somebody's going to stand on it
[1:14:06] and believe who they are
[1:14:16] now that'll be just like maybe what the
[1:14:18] prophet said he said the people would
[1:14:20] come to a place that
[1:14:21] they'd say you know the tribulation
[1:14:23] starts falling and things start going
[1:14:24] wrong
[1:14:24] and they'd say but we thought
[1:14:28] we was to go in a rapture that we was to
[1:14:31] be
[1:14:32] go and leave out of here before the
[1:14:33] tribulation
[1:14:35] but we thought see
[1:14:39] come on direct quote if you need it
[1:14:42] people would come to that basis of
[1:14:43] saying
[1:14:44] i thought
[1:14:51] the church is left up to me and you
[1:14:54] that's what i'm
[1:14:55] that's bearing on my heart more than
[1:14:57] anything in the world because that's why
[1:14:59] i just picked to go this way this
[1:15:01] morning and not not go with the notes
[1:15:04] for one thing we have got to stand upon
[1:15:08] what has been brought to us
[1:15:10] and we haven't played six and seven
[1:15:12] little messages along the way
[1:15:13] to try to get you to understand we've
[1:15:15] been talking about this for 50 years
[1:15:19] come on how long have you been here how
[1:15:20] long have you been here brother ray
[1:15:23] 20-something years some of you been here
[1:15:26] 40
[1:15:26] 50 years brother colley brother
[1:15:29] daugherty
[1:15:30] 50 years
[1:15:34] you know for one thing for sure that
[1:15:37] i've hollered and screamed about this
[1:15:39] ever since you've been here at least
[1:15:47] like that brother was saying there the
[1:15:48] other night he said
[1:15:51] you know that you talk about brother uh
[1:15:55] ron spencer when he was at one of those
[1:15:56] meetings preaching that we needed this
[1:15:58] we needed that we need it isn't that
[1:16:00] but see where did it do any good for the
[1:16:02] ministers
[1:16:03] where did they pick that up and start
[1:16:05] preaching that
[1:16:07] we're around this message have they
[1:16:09] picked it up and and tried to teach
[1:16:11] adoptions and their things
[1:16:15] oh they're beyond that oh yeah
[1:16:18] we're beyond that we've we've already we
[1:16:21] got the new birth well that's what your
[1:16:22] prophet said now listen
[1:16:24] i've got them laying at home and some
[1:16:25] with me your prophet said that's where
[1:16:27] your pentecostal people
[1:16:29] thought that they got the new birth and
[1:16:32] that was
[1:16:33] and he said and they did right he said
[1:16:36] and they thought that that was the end
[1:16:39] of it
[1:16:40] that that was all that was required i'm
[1:16:43] telling you to be changed and go in the
[1:16:45] moment between
[1:16:46] requires more than a new birth of
[1:16:48] luther's way
[1:16:49] age or wesley or zeus or street
[1:16:52] amen if it's true
[1:16:58] that the life stage of adoption is to
[1:17:00] wit to understand the redemption of the
[1:17:01] body
[1:17:02] the prophet said that'll take place at
[1:17:04] the resurrection
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:07] well if it's true then that's what's
[1:17:09] going to take place but you know what
[1:17:10] your resurrection is inside of you
[1:17:15] by the baptism of the holy ghost you
[1:17:16] have with inside of you the thing that
[1:17:18] will take you in a change
[1:17:22] that's why there's no fear i'm not
[1:17:25] afraid of all of these viruses or
[1:17:26] whatever takes place
[1:17:29] because we're not supposed to be here
[1:17:31] under a tribulation
[1:17:35] like you're trying to make it but we can
[1:17:38] be here when this thing becomes so
[1:17:40] physically bereft until we don't even
[1:17:42] have food to eat
[1:17:46] well now god's not going to let that see
[1:17:47] there's where you've got your pity
[1:17:49] pattern without you thank god
[1:17:50] you think your god is not able to handle
[1:17:52] all of these things
[1:17:55] god knows how to separate what
[1:17:56] tribulation is to tribulation that work
[1:17:58] with patience
[1:18:00] he knows how to bring things upon you
[1:18:02] and i that can even take members of our
[1:18:05] family i'll quote it to you from the
[1:18:06] prophet but i can read it to you
[1:18:09] you just got your notes you just run
[1:18:11] through it and you'll find him saying
[1:18:14] that the holy spirit said i even took
[1:18:17] their families
[1:18:19] i made them sick
[1:18:22] and said they stood on the word
[1:18:26] and still believe me to be
[1:18:31] the healer the deliverer the thing then
[1:18:34] now take them out and adopt them
[1:18:40] the one thing that i've never understood
[1:18:41] of people
[1:18:44] the prophet said he'd take you out on
[1:18:45] the back side of the desert
[1:18:52] um he said
[1:18:57] preach you would give something
[1:19:02] all right out on the back side of the
[1:19:04] desert
[1:19:07] he said then you'll come forth to be a
[1:19:08] child of god
[1:19:10] the way that he wanted it
[1:19:14] well
[1:19:19] one brother said one time he said
[1:19:21] because he's been a little bit sarcastic
[1:19:22] maybe i was too okay
[1:19:24] he said something about you know the the
[1:19:27] like that the authorities and the things
[1:19:29] you know and he said well
[1:19:31] you know you're just saying that
[1:19:35] you've got it and we ain't i said ain't
[1:19:37] never said nothing like that
[1:19:40] because i believe it's for the entire
[1:19:42] body of jesus christ
[1:19:45] but i believe i'm a part of it i'm a
[1:19:48] part of the body
[1:19:50] i'm a part of the fifo ministry
[1:19:54] and i believe that you say does that
[1:19:57] make you no don't make me nothing
[1:19:59] see because he is the fifo minister
[1:20:06] adoption is
[1:20:09] sonship coming into being
[1:20:13] now i don't know where i have it let's
[1:20:15] see let's see if i can find that
[1:20:20] yeah let me just read you a few things
[1:20:23] from other translations
[1:20:26] beside the king james
[1:20:32] romans 8 and 23 speaks of
[1:20:36] to wit the redemption of our body
[1:20:41] listen to what one translator says
[1:20:43] longing the adoption
[1:20:45] that shall ransom our body from its
[1:20:48] bondage
[1:20:51] these are other translators you know
[1:20:55] while we eagerly await our full our full
[1:20:58] adoption of sons
[1:21:01] the redemption of our bodies
[1:21:05] full adoption redemption that's some
[1:21:07] good thought
[1:21:09] as we wait for full sonship in the
[1:21:12] redemption
[1:21:13] of our bodies as we await that right of
[1:21:17] sonship
[1:21:19] that involves our bodily redemption
[1:21:25] what we'll write for a redemption of our
[1:21:27] bodies which will mean that it
[1:21:30] at last we have realized
[1:21:33] our full sonship in him
[1:21:41] for the eager outlook of creation
[1:21:45] ardently awaits the revealing
[1:21:50] of the sons of god
[1:21:54] for the longing of the creation looks
[1:21:57] eagerly for the time
[1:21:59] when the glory of the sons of god
[1:22:02] shall be revealed
[1:22:05] this is what other translators i got a
[1:22:07] book that's got 26 translations in it
[1:22:10] and it's wonderful to talk and see what
[1:22:12] they were talking about
[1:22:15] i don't go by that i still use the king
[1:22:16] james i don't know you doctrine but
[1:22:18] but i still read some of these
[1:22:22] all creation is yearning longing
[1:22:25] to see the manifestation of the sons of
[1:22:29] god
[1:22:32] for the creation waits with eager
[1:22:35] longing
[1:22:36] for the revealing of the sons of god
[1:22:40] for the creation waits impetuously or
[1:22:44] what he pronounces
[1:22:45] for god's sons to be made known
[1:22:49] waits for the revealing the declaring
[1:22:54] the sonship
[1:22:58] the whole creation is at tiptoes
[1:23:02] to see the wonderful sights of the sons
[1:23:05] of god
[1:23:06] coming into their own
[1:23:11] longing for the adoption that shall
[1:23:13] ransom our body
[1:23:15] from bondage so you get different ones
[1:23:18] eagerly awaiting our full adoption the
[1:23:21] redemption of our bodies
[1:23:25] await the right of sonship
[1:23:29] that involves our bodily redemption
[1:23:33] sonship
[1:23:37] sonship
[1:23:40] will end with a bodily redemption
[1:23:46] you're not wanting to do that you're not
[1:23:48] wanting to have that part
[1:23:50] you're not thinking about it then in the
[1:23:52] age that we're living that this is our
[1:23:54] time
[1:23:54] where else is there anybody to come
[1:23:56] forth where is the promise in the bible
[1:23:58] for another group of people to come
[1:24:00] forth
[1:24:04] we might not be that people well i don't
[1:24:06] know but i'm part of it i'm glad of that
[1:24:09] that what little bit i can understand i
[1:24:11] like
[1:24:14] but a bodily redemption
[1:24:18] the lord jesus christ body was
[1:24:22] bodily redeemed
[1:24:25] not because he was sinful but because he
[1:24:27] had a beginning see our bodies are going
[1:24:31] to be changed one day into the glorious
[1:24:33] image on our body like unto his glorious
[1:24:35] body
[1:24:39] that's sonship
[1:24:44] you know how you like you you know
[1:24:47] you're proud of your children when
[1:24:48] people brag on you as a
[1:24:50] man was a friend of ours at a bank there
[1:24:53] at home he told me one day he said sam
[1:24:55] he said
[1:24:56] you and your wife must have done a good
[1:24:57] job said you've done a good job raising
[1:24:59] the kids
[1:25:00] well you know i like that
[1:25:03] you're patting on your back yo that's
[1:25:04] good
[1:25:06] i like what he was saying because
[1:25:09] that meant more to me than it would if a
[1:25:12] joe blow off the street walked up
[1:25:14] and just said you you've i'm talking
[1:25:17] about somebody with full authorities and
[1:25:19] things that understood
[1:25:20] something had to bring forth into
[1:25:22] manifestation
[1:25:24] in a life or whatever for him to be able
[1:25:26] to fully say those things
[1:25:28] and i enjoyed it
[1:25:32] are you not proud of your children
[1:25:37] oh yeah sometimes we'll beat the
[1:25:39] daylights out of them you know
[1:25:41] scream and holler at them and everything
[1:25:42] in the world but you know what
[1:25:46] they're still their children
[1:25:49] but you know what i like about god in
[1:25:51] his ways
[1:25:53] i'll get back to this those who do not
[1:25:56] come to the point of a full adoption
[1:26:01] are going to have to go by the grave
[1:26:03] that's the point i'm making
[1:26:04] because each one of these relationship
