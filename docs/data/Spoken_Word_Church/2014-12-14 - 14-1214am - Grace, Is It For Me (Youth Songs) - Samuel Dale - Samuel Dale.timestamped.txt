[28:19] you know
[28:22] nobody got it up yet but we'll
[28:25] get to it okay
[28:27] romans 3 24 i just want to make a few
[28:30] comments about what i've been preaching
[28:31] on in a very short point
[28:34] and then we will
[28:35] go into the rest of the service
[28:39] paul says being justified freely
[28:42] by his grace through the redemption that
[28:45] is in christ jesus
[28:47] and what god has set forth as a perpetu
[28:50] to be a perpetuation through faith in
[28:52] his blood i didn't put this one on but
[28:54] to declare his righteousness for the
[28:56] remissions of sins that are passed
[28:58] through the forbearance of god all right
[29:00] now we'll go to
[29:02] ephesians 1
[29:04] and verse 6.
[29:08] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[29:10] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[29:12] blood
[29:13] in whom we have redemption through his
[29:14] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[29:17] to the riches of his grace
[29:19] we're in he had to bound it toward us in
[29:21] all wisdom and prudence
[29:23] having made known unto us what the
[29:26] mystery of his will
[29:28] according to his good pleasure which he
[29:30] has purpose
[29:32] in himself
[29:34] so we don't know that it's in his time
[29:36] right you may be seated the lord had his
[29:38] blessing
[29:39] to the reading of the word now i just
[29:42] want to
[29:43] cover a point
[29:45] you know
[29:47] and i really want to ask you a question
[29:50] you know
[29:52] we talk a lot about grace
[29:55] we talk about it being grace grace
[29:57] amazing grace and
[29:59] talk about how it's unmerited favor and
[30:02] and all of the things of being
[30:05] in the line of grace
[30:07] and
[30:08] you know
[30:10] what i want to ask the question
[30:12] is
[30:14] is it for you
[30:15] or is it for me
[30:17] you know
[30:20] the title is grace is it for
[30:22] me
[30:24] you know
[30:26] everything that we receive from god we
[30:28] must receive
[30:30] by revelation
[30:33] all right to where he can reveal it unto
[30:35] us and see then grace
[30:38] as i tried to cover in the life's
[30:40] message there was the greatest attribute
[30:43] that i could think of
[30:45] in all of the things that god
[30:48] was displaying was grace
[30:51] because it was way back before the law
[30:54] it was in the law at the time you know
[30:56] and after the law but there was no grace
[30:59] in the law it was the letter
[31:02] and that's why paul would say the letter
[31:04] killeth
[31:05] but the spirit giveth life see there's
[31:08] no grace in it now there was grace while
[31:10] it was in existence
[31:13] but the law the law
[31:15] was just like putting you in jail
[31:18] it was nothing to get you out it was a
[31:20] condemner
[31:22] you know
[31:23] a prosecutor
[31:25] of things but then see we believe that
[31:28] grace is unmerited favor
[31:31] that we didn't do anything to get it
[31:35] right
[31:36] and see then
[31:38] it's what god gave to man
[31:42] and remember how we brought it out that
[31:44] the grace was
[31:45] the first thing in the garden because as
[31:48] quick as they done wrong
[31:50] the atonement was made that was grace
[31:53] all right see then we covered that
[31:57] grace being to israel in the form of a
[32:01] prophet
[32:03] and see now to the world
[32:06] a prophet is
[32:08] judgment
[32:10] all right now don't misunderstand me see
[32:13] to the world and to people that are are
[32:16] not what we call christians and things
[32:20] a prophet is a judgment sign right
[32:23] all right
[32:24] but to the people of god who will accept
[32:26] it it's grace
[32:29] why because god is going to speak
[32:33] you see he never does anything outside
[32:35] of coming through the prophets and
[32:37] speaking through them
[32:39] you know his word and brother branham
[32:41] even used it he said the messiah is
[32:43] going to speak so we know thor john the
[32:45] baptist was that introduced the messiah
[32:48] all right as i told you we started off
[32:50] then talking about a prophet
[32:53] and in it amazing that you wind up in
[32:56] the gentile dispensation
[32:58] of winding up that you wind up with a
[33:01] prophet
[33:02] being sent to bring us the
[33:05] complete word all right now that's to me
[33:08] is grace
[33:10] and like brother brown said one time
[33:11] like this he says then god gave he said
[33:15] he went to the jews
[33:17] and said he even went to the samaritans
[33:19] you remember
[33:20] in doings you know and and talking with
[33:22] them a little bit but said he never went
[33:24] to the gentiles
[33:27] all right
[33:28] because he was going to go to the
[33:30] gentiles in the end time
[33:32] all right now i appreciate that i think
[33:36] you know about that grace
[33:38] of what it is
[33:40] but what i want you to think about
[33:44] grace is only for those who accept it
[33:49] you remember a pardon is not a pardon
[33:52] unless received is one
[33:54] all right
[33:55] you can hold the paper in your hand
[33:58] you remember the man did
[34:00] they they said it signed you know
[34:02] abraham lincoln and all and he had the
[34:04] paper but yet they killed him the next
[34:06] morning because he refused to
[34:08] accept his
[34:10] grace
[34:12] all right
[34:13] see then they had to pass the law apart
[34:15] that grace is not
[34:17] you know a pardon not a pardon unless
[34:19] received is one well we ought to see
[34:21] that's that way in god he's not going to
[34:23] force himself upon you
[34:27] he will not make you receive him
[34:30] see
[34:32] he won't we want to thank well there
[34:34] paul was he he you know he just got
[34:36] knocked down and and and you know he
[34:39] made him take it no he didn't make him
[34:41] take it
[34:44] see because you can't do that all right
[34:47] but is it for you
[34:51] and before i start that point i want to
[34:54] remind you of what i tried to say that
[34:56] may be hard for
[34:58] the natural mind to comprehend but to me
[35:01] grace is a person
[35:05] it is the person
[35:07] of jesus christ
[35:10] to come down
[35:12] pay the price
[35:14] do the atonement do everything and then
[35:17] come and live in us
[35:20] now if that wouldn't be what you would
[35:21] think about grace i don't know what what
[35:24] you would want to think about how that
[35:25] he would do every bit of that for you
[35:27] and i
[35:28] but now remember then being a person
[35:32] he is the person of the word
[35:36] so he doesn't leave us to just look out
[35:38] and say well grace is a person
[35:41] he died for me
[35:43] you know
[35:44] he leaves us the word
[35:48] he or brought us the word
[35:51] which is the person of god in word form
[35:56] all right any problem with that john 1
[35:59] 1. you know in the beginning was the
[36:01] word word with god and the word was god
[36:03] all right
[36:04] now then that word being there being the
[36:08] the product of god's grace
[36:12] that he himself would come down
[36:15] and die
[36:17] to release his life
[36:19] that he might be able to
[36:21] transmit that life to you and i
[36:24] or to bring the grace into being so
[36:26] that's what we've been talking about on
[36:28] the what we've been doing is displaying
[36:30] his attributes
[36:31] um
[36:32] to me that's the greatest this is
[36:34] message number eight on it
[36:36] that the greatest display of his
[36:38] attributes
[36:40] is to see what really true grace is now
[36:43] not disgrace
[36:45] i've been through it over up and down
[36:47] every form trying to make sure you don't
[36:50] misunderstand me you know
[36:52] i mean making sure you you don't get the
[36:54] wrong thing out of what i'm saying see
[36:57] we don't believe in disgrace we believe
[36:59] in true grace
[37:01] disgrace won't get you anywhere
[37:03] you said and holler all day long that
[37:05] you're you're god's children and and or
[37:09] can't be judged and all this stuff
[37:11] you can do everything all day long
[37:13] you're still going to judgment if it's
[37:15] not corrected
[37:16] right all right
[37:18] see then that'll that'll put us into
[37:20] that place to where that we you know we
[37:23] want to not just scream for grace
[37:27] but to realize what it cost
[37:32] do you realize what it costs to bring
[37:33] grace
[37:35] i mean you've ever just really thought
[37:36] about that point what it costs to bring
[37:39] grace into being
[37:43] that god himself
[37:45] not a second person we don't believe in
[37:47] trinitarianism but it wouldn't matter if
[37:49] i did if i believed in trinitarianism
[37:52] i'd have three piles up here to show you
[37:54] that all of that is still a product of
[37:57] grace
[37:58] you know and would be
[38:00] three times worse
[38:02] because each one of what they would
[38:03] suffer but we know what he suffered
[38:07] to bring that grace into being
[38:10] he came into the world and lived as a
[38:12] man
[38:15] died
[38:16] at the hands of a sinful man beat until
[38:19] he looked like a piece of hamburger meat
[38:22] there was a cat of nine tails you know
[38:24] on the things
[38:25] but
[38:26] being that very person
[38:30] of grace
[38:33] people to think about that and then
[38:35] reading the word and the prophet said if
[38:37] you don't see what christ in every verse
[38:39] go back and read again
[38:41] but i want to ask you or i want a
[38:43] thought in your mind
[38:45] grace is it for
[38:47] us
[38:52] all right now we know for certainty
[38:56] that god paid the price for everybody
[38:59] right
[39:01] now
[39:02] get down to the not a pardon unless
[39:04] being received as one all right
[39:07] grace paid the price for every person in
[39:10] the world
[39:13] all right
[39:15] but what's wrong with the people then
[39:20] they won't accept
[39:24] what was done for them
[39:28] right
[39:29] if they won't accept it then god can't
[39:31] override that and make you receive it
[39:34] right
[39:34] so then now getting to that way of
[39:37] approaching it we can boldly say that
[39:40] grace is not for everyone
[39:46] right
[39:47] because it's for those who will accept
[39:49] it
[39:52] but for those who will not accept it
[39:56] sure he paid the price for the bible
[39:58] city for the sins of the world
[40:01] all right he died for everybody in the
[40:03] world but for all but those who would
[40:06] accept him was the ones that grace would
[40:08] be imparted
[40:10] grace is not imparted unto you unless
[40:12] you receive it
[40:16] well it don't matter what i do god loves
[40:19] me so much to you no no no no not quite
[40:21] now that's really getting a little bit
[40:23] further than the baptist used to be
[40:26] you know
[40:28] but think about it
[40:32] grace
[40:35] now what we want to do sometimes is we
[40:38] want to
[40:39] uh divide out things
[40:42] i don't know whether that's a good word
[40:44] to use but
[40:46] what i mean
[40:48] is we want to
[40:50] even look in the bible
[40:53] and looking into the bible we look at it
[40:55] and we
[40:56] we want to think part of it's true
[41:00] and maybe part of it's not
[41:04] well now
[41:05] number one what kind of a bible would
[41:07] that be
[41:08] all right and if yours reads that away
[41:11] then
[41:11] i'd suggest you check the authors
[41:14] because you may have some good news for
[41:16] modern men or something involved
[41:18] you know even they're not that far off
[41:21] most of the time but you know i would
[41:24] check it out
[41:27] but what about the promises of god
[41:33] they're for everybody right
[41:36] but everybody won't receive it
[41:38] that's right
[41:40] so he's not responsible correctly
[41:44] because we make our own choice
[41:47] all right
[41:49] see then once he lays it out in front of
[41:51] us
[41:53] he gives us a choice to receive it
[41:56] if we don't receive it
[41:59] it don't matter how much you read and
[42:01] holler and scream about grace
[42:04] it's no good
[42:06] all right
[42:08] but what about
[42:10] is part of the word right
[42:13] is my point i want to get at for a
[42:15] minute
[42:17] it's part of the word right
[42:19] and part of it not right
[42:23] then how would we have hebrews 13 8
[42:26] to be saying that he's the same
[42:28] yesterday today and forever
[42:32] well that that old bible that's just
[42:34] what some man wrote well thank god
[42:36] that's true
[42:38] you know
[42:40] i mean that's that's true
[42:42] that's what some man wrote
[42:44] but you know that some man
[42:47] was guided
[42:49] by the hand of god
[42:51] to write
[42:52] what he wrote
[42:54] so it's not the words of man
[42:59] it's the word of god
[43:01] because if he didn't you'd change one
[43:02] one you'd say in the beginning was the
[43:04] word that man thought about and hoped it
[43:06] was right and maybe it was right and he
[43:08] wrote it down
[43:09] no it doesn't even mention it like that
[43:11] does it the beginning was the word the
[43:13] word was with god and the word
[43:16] was god
[43:18] all right
[43:20] but i want you to think of it like that
[43:23] to doubt one word
[43:26] or a promise
[43:28] you know
[43:32] what would it do to us
[43:37] to that one word what would it do to us
[43:43] then to believe that part of the word is
[43:46] correct
[43:49] but part of it's not correct
[43:53] now who are we going to get to tell us
[43:55] what's right
[43:56] and what's wrong
[43:59] you know what
[44:01] i mean we've got to find something right
[44:03] right
[44:05] but see i thought the word was correct
[44:10] i thought every word was correct
[44:13] i thought it was all the word of god
[44:17] because if it's not all the word of god
[44:19] then how can we judge what part is god
[44:21] and what is not
[44:29] see
[44:29] it's either
[44:31] i'm looking at what the prophet said
[44:33] about he said it's either all good
[44:36] or there's none of it good
[44:38] i like to quote i was looking for
[44:40] something you know
[44:42] he said
[44:42] it's either all good
[44:45] or
[44:46] none of it's good
[44:50] it's either right
[44:53] or we need somebody
[44:57] to tell us what's right
[44:59] and what's wrong
[45:01] all right now a lot of people think
[45:03] brother branham come to tell us what's
[45:06] right
[45:07] and what's wrong
[45:09] now
[45:14] did he ever tell us what part of the
[45:16] word was wrong
[45:18] i've been around quite a while and you
[45:23] my understanding of
[45:26] of the way he brings things is
[45:31] it's either all god or let's forget it
[45:34] right and that's
[45:36] paraphrase quote that's
[45:39] very close
[45:41] you know
[45:43] but think about it
[45:46] is it right or is it wrong
[45:50] if it's of god it must be right
[45:53] all right
[45:55] and he'd say it like this
[45:58] say well we believe this
[46:04] we don't believe this
[46:06] you know
[46:09] well you can't believe this
[46:12] without believing this all right
[46:15] now that's taken from the message when
[46:16] his eyes were open
[46:18] they knew him
[46:20] you got to believe it all
[46:22] it's either all god
[46:25] or it isn't any god
[46:28] all right
[46:29] now remember the point i was making a
[46:32] few weeks ago
[46:34] on the marriage and divorce that we were
[46:35] talking on
[46:37] that
[46:38] everybody wants to correct brother
[46:40] branham you know he's wrong here he's
[46:43] right here and you know he should have
[46:45] said this the author said that what he's
[46:47] done he ought to let me
[46:48] showed him what was right
[46:51] you know people don't like me being that
[46:54] strong about it but isn't that true
[46:57] i mean if you can tell me brother brown
[46:59] was wrong i want you to show me
[47:02] right
[47:03] and then if you can show me he was wrong
[47:07] then i need to follow you
[47:10] why because you straightened him out
[47:14] well you remember the point i was making
[47:16] though did he you know everybody they
[47:18] they want us correct this they want to
[47:20] correct that but i haven't heard any
[47:22] doctrine yet where they're correct in
[47:24] marriage and divorce
[47:28] you know
[47:30] everybody wants that
[47:32] everybody wants the grace
[47:35] you know
[47:37] oh they may have a lot of
[47:38] interpretations about thoughts
[47:40] but everybody's kind of holding on to
[47:41] that
[47:44] well
[47:47] if that's right
[47:50] then the other's right
[47:53] but if that's wrong
[47:54] then the other is wrong that's what we
[47:56] just read right
[48:01] so it's either all god
[48:04] or it's not god you say well there's
[48:06] problems here with this hey
[48:09] you don't let's don't
[48:12] we have a prophet to place our things
[48:14] upon
[48:15] we're not people of the world that what
[48:17] is your and i like that wiggle word i
[48:20] love him i love him big old words people
[48:21] come up with you know what is your input
[48:26] why don't you say what do you got to say
[48:30] you know
[48:31] but what is your input on this
[48:34] do you think the word of god let's see
[48:36] what was that and it used to be do you
[48:38] think that this is the word of god or
[48:40] contains the word of god
[48:47] that's argued in this what 60s
[48:50] way back
[48:54] but what i'm trying to get a point to
[48:56] you and i
[48:58] is
[48:59] if part of the word is right
[49:02] and part of it is wrong
[49:05] we need someone to
[49:07] correct the errors
[49:09] but don't say brother branham corrected
[49:11] the errors because there was no errors
[49:14] to correct
[49:18] true
[49:19] he said the the dian's in the bus is in
[49:22] the right place now i know we're all
[49:25] real good to read
[49:27] where he says well it should have been
[49:29] the lie instead of a lie
[49:33] that's not correcting it
[49:35] that's modernizing it or putting in the
[49:37] terminologies that helps us to
[49:39] understand
[49:41] it's not a correction
[49:44] it's just a point that it's the same lie
[49:46] that he told eve
[49:49] you say well eli was told to eve and
[49:52] they lies told of us that's the same lie
[49:54] that's all thee is
[49:56] emphasizing huh
[49:59] didn't worry say you know that they
[50:01] without us or whatever precede us
[50:04] you know
[50:05] try to change wordings
[50:07] those words are not changed in their to
[50:10] correct it
[50:12] it's just more modernistic terms we use
[50:16] all right
[50:19] he said well what are you getting at
[50:20] brotherdale
[50:22] i'm getting at what i think and i
[50:24] believe
[50:26] we want to believe what we want to
[50:28] believe
[50:34] and we won't accept
[50:37] truth
[50:40] because that it's the the things that so
[50:43] embedded in our mind
[50:46] until
[50:49] you know
[50:51] we don't want to give in
[50:55] we don't want to admit
[50:57] that we're wrong
[51:02] we don't want to believe that
[51:04] we
[51:06] could be deceived
[51:11] we want to leave it on the basis that
[51:16] i believe this
[51:18] well what about this
[51:20] well i don't know about that
[51:23] i i don't know whether that's right or
[51:25] not
[51:27] well how do you know what the other is
[51:29] right or not
[51:30] i mean we've been taught all of our life
[51:32] this is your right hand how do you know
[51:36] all i got to do is turn around and which
[51:38] way you're going there
[51:42] you say well it's because of this
[51:43] because no i don't prove a point the
[51:46] point is
[51:47] we've been told all of our life a horse
[51:50] is measured by hands not by inches
[51:54] right that's right
[51:56] you go down you say i got a horse down
[51:58] here i don't know how many you'd say 14
[52:00] hands high
[52:02] well you put one of these little kids
[52:04] down there and
[52:07] a hand you got a little bitty pony
[52:13] you get old brother r line
[52:15] and you stretch out his hand on there
[52:18] and you've got a 9-foot horse
[52:23] now whose hand
[52:28] is what
[52:30] you getting what i mean
[52:33] it's whatever we want to make it to be
[52:36] right
[52:37] and what tickles me today this this this
[52:39] is what it gets me
[52:41] and you'll say that horse i don't know
[52:43] about the hands what a
[52:44] well we'll want to say that horse has 14
[52:46] hands the others say 13 and a half
[52:54] and the other guy i'll say 15
[52:57] and they'll argue and shoot each other
[53:00] over
[53:01] what size the horse is
[53:05] or do we do the word of god that way
[53:10] what are you getting at either this
[53:12] message is right or it's not right
[53:16] there's not a gray area to be fallen
[53:18] into
[53:20] the message is right or not right
[53:23] all right if the message is right let's
[53:24] follow the message
[53:30] that's simple isn't it
[53:34] all right
[53:35] if he's right over here and explaining
[53:37] the godhead
[53:40] then he's right over here explaining the
[53:42] no eternal hells
[53:44] you know the things
[53:47] but yeah we want to judge what we think
[53:50] is right
[53:53] and put it to that point all right
[53:57] but what do you think about it
[54:02] do you believe the bible is correct
[54:04] yes
[54:08] do you believe that to add one word to
[54:11] it
[54:14] is death
[54:16] to take one word from it is death
[54:21] then do we believe it
[54:26] you say well well really what are you
[54:28] getting at because you start off talking
[54:30] about grace
[54:32] well
[54:32] we baptist used to describe grace as
[54:35] unmerited favor
[54:38] all right
[54:40] and
[54:41] in their terminologies it meant
[54:43] that it was all right for me to go ahead
[54:45] and do little bitty things now none of
[54:48] them didn't believe in doing big great
[54:49] big ones you know
[54:50] they did hold that point
[54:52] but it's all right do little bitty
[54:54] things
[54:56] because we're saved by grace
[54:59] and they spent all the time trying to
[55:00] figure out whether you were sinning or
[55:03] whether you was uh what was that word
[55:05] you were uh you know
[55:08] manifesting it or whatever you know was
[55:10] doing
[55:11] well you move over to the presbyterian
[55:14] well they kind of held a little more
[55:16] line of say be keeping things a little
[55:18] straighter
[55:19] and and when you would get to that point
[55:22] then you would ask them about grace
[55:24] and they would describe it
[55:27] and they would put a little
[55:29] form of
[55:30] display of works maybe within that you
[55:33] know to do
[55:35] all right you move up to another group
[55:37] of people and ask them what do you think
[55:38] about grace
[55:41] and see everybody would give you the
[55:43] same definition unmerited favor
[55:47] but their description
[55:49] of that unmerited favor
[55:52] determined what they believed
[55:55] more than the words
[55:58] that they used to describe it
[56:03] right
[56:05] that's why you don't have to worry about
[56:06] me because i tell you what i believe
[56:08] but you know yourself most preachers
[56:10] you're not going to get out of them what
[56:11] they believe
[56:15] they're going to just kind of hold back
[56:16] just
[56:18] you know and you're never really going
[56:19] to know exactly what they believe
[56:21] you'll hear them one time
[56:23] and they're going to get a new body
[56:28] huh
[56:30] the next time you hear them they're
[56:32] going to get this body redeemed
[56:37] well you don't know what to believe
[56:42] well
[56:43] no you don't know what to believe
[56:45] because they made two statements
[56:51] see what they're doing is they're trying
[56:52] to fill out the group with them that
[56:54] they're talking to
[56:55] you know
[56:56] and they're trying to find out how many
[56:58] in that group believes it this way or
[56:59] how many of them believes it this way
[57:01] you had never caught on to preachers
[57:03] like that yet
[57:04] you had never seen a preacher and he'll
[57:06] be preaching he'll be reading he'll be
[57:08] preaching he'll be preaching that long
[57:09] he'll just lock in on one side and he'll
[57:12] walk at one side he'll never go the
[57:14] other way because his side over here is
[57:15] agreeing with him
[57:16] right
[57:19] i just
[57:20] watch it and say you know
[57:22] come on
[57:23] wake up
[57:25] but now what about it
[57:29] is grace for everybody
[57:33] if
[57:34] they
[57:34] will
[57:35] accept it
[57:40] yeah
[57:41] but it's not for those who will not
[57:44] accept it
[57:47] all right
[57:50] and see then looking at it
[57:53] and seeing that what it means to you and
[57:55] i
[57:56] we look through the bible and we see the
[57:59] bible is
[58:00] describing
[58:02] the message of grace
[58:04] but it's really describing the person of
[58:07] the lord jesus christ correct
[58:09] this is revelation that over in
[58:11] revelation 1 or you know is
[58:14] the revelation of jesus christ
[58:20] and what do you think about it
[58:25] now laying it down and getting it
[58:27] straight and then we're going to our
[58:28] point we don't believe in disgrace so
[58:30] we're not in that category
[58:32] we don't believe in garbage cans
[58:34] we believe in being the fact that
[58:37] you know that sure all of us are human
[58:39] and we have all made mistakes
[58:42] we have all done wrong in our lives and
[58:45] we all needed salvation
[58:48] all right and then that salvation would
[58:50] be given unto us as unmerited favor
[58:54] because the only thing you could do
[58:58] was the point of what
[59:00] you could accept
[59:02] it then you go through justification
[59:05] sanctification you know and the baptism
[59:07] is really him so you're it's not a point
[59:10] of saying we're going through
[59:11] it's the point of what he's doing
[59:13] all right
[59:15] so then that proves whether or not you
[59:17] believe it by the fact of what you're
[59:18] doing
[59:21] you know
[59:22] you are at least receptive of it
[59:25] and then by accepting it you know the
[59:28] pardon
[59:29] we do look on the pardon now and we see
[59:32] that the requirement is to not just to
[59:35] be as the man was to take the pardon
[59:38] and say you can't kill me
[59:41] the point is now that we must take the
[59:44] pardon
[59:45] and accept it
[59:47] but our accepting it is what that we
[59:50] must walk through
[59:51] certain things
[59:53] whereas he had to accept it walk out of
[59:55] jail
[59:56] we have to go through justification
[59:59] sanctification
[1:00:01] and the baptism of the holy ghost to
[1:00:03] make us the children of god and make us
[1:00:06] then to work that his grace has
[1:00:09] been bestowed upon us
[1:00:13] and paul said therefore being justified
[1:00:15] freely
[1:00:16] by his grace
[1:00:19] me we become his children
[1:00:21] all right
[1:00:23] and see then we believe that grace
[1:00:27] we believe it it's not for everybody
[1:00:29] because everybody won't have it
[1:00:31] but we believe it's for everybody that
[1:00:33] will have it
[1:00:36] and made unto that point
[1:00:38] of grace
[1:00:39] all right
[1:00:41] now
[1:00:43] you know that there's people who believe
[1:00:47] that
[1:00:48] you must go to the tabernacle
[1:00:56] sister sister barbara her husband
[1:00:58] believes he got to go to
[1:01:00] pakistan or what that place is overseas
[1:01:02] you know
[1:01:04] and you know they got to make their trip
[1:01:06] every so often and
[1:01:08] and then we life and make fun of them
[1:01:10] but you know that a lot of people
[1:01:11] believe that you got to go to
[1:01:12] jeffersonville for everything
[1:01:17] and they believe there's nothing
[1:01:18] authentic unless it comes out of
[1:01:19] jeffersonville
[1:01:24] what do you think
[1:01:30] do you believe the message is only for
[1:01:32] those in jeffersonville
[1:01:36] i don't think you do or you'd be there
[1:01:38] now
[1:01:39] right i would
[1:01:41] if that's what i believe i'd be there
[1:01:44] right
[1:01:45] right so it's pretty well proof and i
[1:01:47] don't believe it that way
[1:01:49] i thank god for what's come through
[1:01:50] jeffersonville
[1:01:53] uh-huh
[1:01:55] for the spoken words and all the
[1:01:56] different things
[1:01:58] we have here done everything we could in
[1:02:01] our day to kind of stay in a line of
[1:02:04] believing
[1:02:05] until when they put out the thing that
[1:02:08] we was all wrong for getting the
[1:02:10] messages the way we got them
[1:02:14] we went and purchased the message from
[1:02:16] them
[1:02:18] with the right to use that message
[1:02:22] you know
[1:02:23] to distribute the gospel
[1:02:26] we paid the price of what they
[1:02:28] wanted to do i've never argued with them
[1:02:30] about the things
[1:02:33] i didn't think it was fully necessary
[1:02:35] but i thought that's a good idea costs
[1:02:37] 500
[1:02:38] that's not going to kill us
[1:02:40] we'll just make sure that everybody
[1:02:42] can't say we've done this wrong
[1:02:45] we'll go do it right
[1:02:47] all right
[1:02:48] i thank god for what
[1:02:50] all of these people have done
[1:02:53] y'all didn't come up some of you most of
[1:02:55] you didn't come up the way we did
[1:02:57] when we came into the message
[1:02:59] you know
[1:03:01] i mean i bought every concordance it was
[1:03:06] you know what first 15 pages was to
[1:03:08] prove their doctrine to be right
[1:03:11] i got the books if you want to read them
[1:03:13] and i'm going to show you the doctrines
[1:03:14] you know but
[1:03:17] the rest of it was good
[1:03:19] and even them quotes was good when they
[1:03:21] were put in the right place
[1:03:25] but i don't everything i could to try to
[1:03:27] do that because see y'all you got the
[1:03:29] computers and you just
[1:03:31] sometimes for a sermon i'd search for
[1:03:33] three months for one quote
[1:03:35] my wife would like
[1:03:37] she'd come in my study and i'd have
[1:03:40] earphones on listening to a tape and
[1:03:43] reading a book
[1:03:45] and she looked down and said what are
[1:03:46] you listening to and i'm saying well i
[1:03:48] got the future home in my ears and i'm
[1:03:50] reading uh see not air with a shock
[1:03:53] and she'd just shake her head
[1:03:56] how could i read one book and listen to
[1:03:58] a tape on another one well i'm just
[1:03:59] waiting on some quote to come up you
[1:04:01] know i had to do that
[1:04:04] i thank god for everything that's ever
[1:04:06] been done
[1:04:08] i went to the baptist preacher
[1:04:11] and told him that i appreciated what all
[1:04:13] he done for me
[1:04:16] when i walked out
[1:04:18] i've had to walk out of this
[1:04:20] message in a couple of places
[1:04:22] you know what i told them
[1:04:25] that i appreciate it
[1:04:27] and i do
[1:04:29] i appreciate people that are trying to
[1:04:31] help in any way irregardless of what
[1:04:33] you're trying to do trying to finish it
[1:04:35] up i'll get something good out of it
[1:04:38] if i approach it correctly
[1:04:40] because see what i'm wanting is my
[1:04:42] pardon
[1:04:44] all right
[1:04:46] and everything i can get to do that on
[1:04:48] that pardon i accept that
[1:04:51] so is this grace is the pardon of
[1:04:53] salvation
[1:04:55] you know
[1:04:56] grace for salvation
[1:04:59] do you fully believe that
[1:05:01] or you only believe heart
[1:05:04] see if you believe you've done something
[1:05:06] good and that's the reason god saves you
[1:05:09] then your your grace is not grace that's
[1:05:12] works
[1:05:14] right that's something you've done
[1:05:17] but when you know and realize you didn't
[1:05:18] do nothing
[1:05:20] but then you scream and run to that
[1:05:23] pardon
[1:05:24] and then you hold it
[1:05:28] you know
[1:05:29] and you come out of it with an
[1:05:31] understanding
[1:05:32] of the grace of god
[1:05:36] do you know that brother branham
[1:05:38] actually said
[1:05:40] this message was only for the tabernacle
[1:05:54] his brother dale says something then he
[1:05:55] throws it up on the screen so let's read
[1:05:57] it
[1:05:59] what do you think about it
[1:06:02] what are you thinking about
[1:06:05] this message
[1:06:07] uh
[1:06:09] let's go to number
[1:06:12] number four brother
[1:06:14] well excuse me going down going down to
[1:06:17] five i like that one for the point of
[1:06:18] what i want you to get
[1:06:20] rolled it onto five
[1:06:22] this is taken from a thinking man's
[1:06:24] filter
[1:06:25] and look what he says
[1:06:30] this message
[1:06:33] all and all other the messages i speak
[1:06:35] on is directed to my congregation
[1:06:41] it's not for your congregation
[1:06:45] so
[1:06:49] unless you want to receive it but it's
[1:06:52] directed to this people
[1:06:54] all right
[1:06:55] look at what he said i want you to know
[1:06:57] that that this is only for my
[1:06:59] congregation i speak these things i have
[1:07:02] a right to do that because i've been set
[1:07:06] by the holy spirit to watch over these
[1:07:08] sheep
[1:07:09] now
[1:07:11] now we've got a
[1:07:13] thing laid out
[1:07:16] that
[1:07:17] we have the words of the prophet
[1:07:21] that
[1:07:22] it's only for his congregation
[1:07:28] right
[1:07:30] well we all got to pack up and go to
[1:07:32] jail
[1:07:37] see now you must
[1:07:41] whether you like it or not
[1:07:43] you've got to put a little self-thought
[1:07:51] is that a bad word to swallow give me a
[1:07:53] gooder one i'll say it
[1:07:56] you've got to self-interpret
[1:08:04] come on if you don't self-interpret and
[1:08:07] say wait a minute we are his
[1:08:09] congregation
[1:08:12] then we're not his congregation we
[1:08:15] either are or we're not
[1:08:17] right
[1:08:18] uh the hall of background
[1:08:20] either right or wrong it's either god or
[1:08:24] not god
[1:08:27] but i don't interpret nothing i just say
[1:08:30] what he says
[1:08:32] well that's good
[1:08:35] huh
[1:08:38] look on over to number
[1:08:40] six
[1:08:41] taken out of thinking men's filter
[1:08:45] and he's talking about how these things
[1:08:47] was done in top to israel for the
[1:08:48] congregation of israel only
[1:08:51] no is that true
[1:08:53] god wasn't to the people around
[1:08:57] right
[1:08:58] on to israel
[1:09:01] if ministers disagree on anything that
[1:09:03] said
[1:09:04] this is for my congregation that the
[1:09:06] lord has given me to preach too
[1:09:11] okay
[1:09:13] so now
[1:09:17] what are we doing
[1:09:24] go ahead to number seven
[1:09:27] this is taken from marriage and divorce
[1:09:32] and i'm speaking to our followers only
[1:09:36] who is following me in this message only
[1:09:40] not the outside
[1:09:43] bear me record
[1:09:45] of this before god
[1:09:47] just to this group only
[1:09:51] so is marriage in divorce only for those
[1:09:53] who go to the tabernacle
[1:10:00] see now you're going to have to do what
[1:10:03] you think that you don't do
[1:10:05] that brother dale has got in trouble 40
[1:10:07] years
[1:10:08] of trying to get you to do
[1:10:10] is to use your own brain
[1:10:16] i don't think i just want the mind of
[1:10:18] god well remember it ain't up here it's
[1:10:20] down here
[1:10:24] now if the mind of god was up here we'd
[1:10:26] be in good shape or better but the mind
[1:10:29] of god is down in here
[1:10:31] all right look
[1:10:33] what about the grace of marriage and
[1:10:35] divorce
[1:10:37] some believe it's only for those who go
[1:10:39] to the tabernacle
[1:10:41] or for those who were sitting there when
[1:10:43] he preached it
[1:10:45] now let's read what he said
[1:10:48] this is
[1:10:49] go back to number three
[1:10:52] and this is taken from marriage and
[1:10:54] divorce
[1:10:55] paragraph
[1:10:57] uh
[1:10:58] 312
[1:11:00] 313.
[1:11:02] don't you dare try to do it again i'm
[1:11:04] speaking only to my
[1:11:07] congregation
[1:11:11] so now is that right or is it wrong
[1:11:15] now you must
[1:11:17] define
[1:11:20] what is right and what's wrong
[1:11:23] you must define
[1:11:25] if he's talking about
[1:11:27] that group of people that was sitting
[1:11:29] there that day amen
[1:11:34] or is it the message that's going to the
[1:11:37] entire bride
[1:11:39] that he is the
[1:11:41] that we as the bride are his
[1:11:43] congregation
[1:11:45] now which definition do you use
[1:11:50] right
[1:11:54] look at number four
[1:11:58] this is from christ the mystery god
[1:11:59] revealed
[1:12:02] preached in 1965 paragraph 40.
[1:12:06] these tales going he's talking now he's
[1:12:07] speaking why in the marriage in divorce
[1:12:10] you said this you said that
[1:12:12] and you know
[1:12:13] these tapes goes only i'm speaking to my
[1:12:15] congregation brother i'm not responsible
[1:12:18] for what god gives you to shepherd i'm
[1:12:20] responsible what kind of food i feed
[1:12:23] these people
[1:12:25] this is for this tabernacle only
[1:12:33] see now if the people want to listen to
[1:12:35] the tapes that's up to them but i'm
[1:12:38] speaking to what god has given to me
[1:12:40] it was their sins that was omitted
[1:12:43] right
[1:12:44] see
[1:12:46] it to this this is only to this people
[1:12:48] right here
[1:12:51] the people here in the tabernacle
[1:12:53] my own flock
[1:12:55] now if god wants to be you know if you
[1:12:57] want to people want to be hybrid go
[1:12:58] ahead
[1:12:59] now what is what are you going to use
[1:13:01] there
[1:13:03] what is your definition
[1:13:09] i lay before you a
[1:13:13] a situation
[1:13:16] so we can define that
[1:13:20] the grace of god
[1:13:24] you know even if we try to upgrade it
[1:13:26] pull it on
[1:13:27] we would define the grace of god for
[1:13:29] salvation for the new birth of things
[1:13:32] you know
[1:13:33] would
[1:13:34] be for all those who believe
[1:13:39] and when the prophet would say this
[1:13:40] message is for my followers
[1:13:42] we quickly move ourselves into that
[1:13:46] point
[1:13:47] of being a follower
[1:13:50] brother and said about paul he said paul
[1:13:53] was real quick to
[1:13:55] think about himself as being part of the
[1:13:57] promise that's paraphrasing it but it's
[1:13:59] close
[1:14:00] about the seed of abraham said he was
[1:14:02] quick
[1:14:03] to say that see he wanted the people to
[1:14:05] know you know i'm related to this
[1:14:08] all right what about you
[1:14:11] is the grace for
[1:14:15] anybody that will accept it
[1:14:19] of salvation but then we move up to
[1:14:21] marriage in divorce
[1:14:24] and we had to be either sitting in the
[1:14:26] building that day when it was preached
[1:14:28] or have to be in that building today
[1:14:32] to be able to qualify for marriage and
[1:14:33] divorce
[1:14:39] that's why i asked the question is it
[1:14:42] for me
[1:14:46] what do you think
[1:14:48] i don't know arguments to nobody about
[1:14:50] anything
[1:14:51] no problems
[1:14:54] but as pastor i state what i believe
[1:14:57] i believe when the prophet said this is
[1:14:59] for my congregation i'm happy to relate
[1:15:02] to the point that i believe that i'm
[1:15:05] part of that congregation
[1:15:11] and that doesn't mean i've got to go to
[1:15:13] jeffersonville
[1:15:15] you know
[1:15:17] because i believe it like he said when
[1:15:20] he said lord said you just couldn't
[1:15:21] trust me
[1:15:23] see all these others has got their
[1:15:24] million dollar buildings and time and
[1:15:26] the lord told him said just look up
[1:15:30] he said here's your
[1:15:34] church
[1:15:35] right paraphrasing the word i remember
[1:15:37] exactly the words of you but here's your
[1:15:39] congregation
[1:15:44] your message is to the whole world
[1:15:47] those who will accept it
[1:15:50] all right now we're going to be the ones
[1:15:52] that defines well now
[1:15:54] it's got to be this way it's got to be
[1:15:55] that way well okay
[1:15:58] but just remember
[1:15:59] if you can take
[1:16:02] out one piece
[1:16:04] of your puzzle and say that only applies
[1:16:07] to jeffersonville indiana
[1:16:10] and put it down that way or that it only
[1:16:12] applies to those that were sitting there
[1:16:15] that day
[1:16:17] you know that it was preached
[1:16:19] then
[1:16:20] you have just annihilated your whole
[1:16:23] point of grace
[1:16:27] is it for me
[1:16:33] they have a group not too far from us
[1:16:37] and they have that this
[1:16:39] brother's a missionary so he goes out
[1:16:41] and he starts churches
[1:16:43] and then he puts in
[1:16:47] a pastor
[1:16:49] that becomes the associate pastor
[1:16:54] because the other man's a pastor
[1:16:56] you know because that's kind of like
[1:16:58] apostolic successions and different
[1:17:01] things you know that are going and
[1:17:03] what do we have
[1:17:07] you know
[1:17:09] oh
[1:17:12] is it up to one to a point
[1:17:15] you know somebody to a position or is it
[1:17:18] the holy spirit to lead
[1:17:20] them into that position
[1:17:22] uh i don't go to that point but i don't
[1:17:25] have no problems because it's none of my
[1:17:27] business you know
[1:17:28] anything's none of my business you know
[1:17:30] what that's done in my business
[1:17:34] but you see if i'm going to believe one
[1:17:36] thing is for me
[1:17:38] then i'm going to believe it's all for
[1:17:39] me
[1:17:41] he said well do you believe the grace of
[1:17:43] god is i believe the grace of god let me
[1:17:47] give the life statement of it and
[1:17:49] that here's somebody he's right over in
[1:17:51] that church over there
[1:17:53] and he's
[1:17:55] you know
[1:17:56] he needs salvation
[1:17:58] i believe he can come into the word of
[1:18:00] god and receive that as salvation
[1:18:04] if he has a marital situation
[1:18:07] he can come under the grace
[1:18:09] of marriage and divorce
[1:18:12] now well i'll go with you on the
[1:18:14] salvation but it won't go willy on the
[1:18:15] marriage in divorce well all right
[1:18:17] you're taking hyphen atonement
[1:18:20] i'm taking it all
[1:18:23] because why would you want to believe it
[1:18:24] that way
[1:18:27] now i don't have anything to call him up
[1:18:29] telling me to come over here
[1:18:30] hey we're sitting right here
[1:18:34] i've never told any of you you were
[1:18:35] right
[1:18:38] we have marital situation sitting here
[1:18:40] you know in the church
[1:18:42] you know what i mean people married
[1:18:44] before etc
[1:18:46] i've never told any of you you're right
[1:18:49] i always tell you that you must go
[1:18:51] before god
[1:18:53] and ask him what's right
[1:18:57] because if i told you what was right
[1:18:59] that would be my presumption
[1:19:03] right because i don't know the whole
[1:19:05] story
[1:19:07] you know
[1:19:09] i i don't know everything correctly so
[1:19:12] that to me is why brother branham said
[1:19:14] he said we don't have time to straighten
[1:19:16] these things out he would have had to
[1:19:18] take an ever individual person to went
[1:19:22] through their life and seen what it was
[1:19:24] and to do he would have had to do and he
[1:19:26] didn't have the time
[1:19:29] but he said i say go on
[1:19:32] as you are
[1:19:34] all right
[1:19:36] i accept that as being the word of god
[1:19:39] but i accept that it's being for
[1:19:42] anyone who can receive it
[1:19:45] but if you can't receive it
[1:19:47] many of you have asked me many questions
[1:19:49] i told you it's not for you if you can't
[1:19:52] accept it
[1:19:56] if you can't accept it it's not for you
[1:19:59] but if you can accept it then deal with
[1:20:01] that between you and god
[1:20:05] why because
[1:20:06] grace is not to be dis stowed out as a
[1:20:10] blanket
[1:20:12] it's an individual affair
[1:20:19] see whether it be grace for the soul or
[1:20:20] whether it be grace for the entire and
[1:20:22] i'll make a life statement without the
[1:20:24] grace i believe
[1:20:26] of the marriage and divorce situation
[1:20:28] that the prophet brought in the last
[1:20:29] days i'll quote the scripture that would
[1:20:32] say
[1:20:33] there would be no flesh saved
[1:20:37] i don't care how good you think you are
[1:20:40] or what you've been
[1:20:44] then there'd be no flesh saved
[1:20:48] so to make sure there's going to be
[1:20:50] something safe
[1:20:51] he's in the grace
[1:20:53] for those who can take that
[1:20:58] accept it
[1:21:01] but i don't like for people to use grace
[1:21:04] in any form to try to prop up
[1:21:08] you know what i mean
[1:21:11] well it's all right because of
[1:21:15] it winds up like i told you about that
[1:21:16] man at work
[1:21:18] that was telling me about god baptized
[1:21:20] jesus come and baptized his wife in the
[1:21:22] hospital bed
[1:21:24] because he didn't know where she's going
[1:21:25] to live or not so he no that's his word
[1:21:28] i thought that's kind of funny but you
[1:21:30] know
[1:21:31] he said
[1:21:32] god didn't know where she's going to
[1:21:33] live or not so he come down and baptized
[1:21:35] her right there in the bed
[1:21:37] i thought okay
[1:21:38] so i asked him a simple question most of
[1:21:41] you know
[1:21:42] i said let's turn this thing around now
[1:21:45] that was my wife laying in the hospital
[1:21:47] bed and i'm telling you the story
[1:21:50] i'm telling you god come down in that
[1:21:52] hospital room and baptize my wife
[1:21:56] i said would you believe that he said no
[1:22:03] he had a wife it was a woman preacher i
[1:22:05] never met her
[1:22:07] never met her never didn't have to worry
[1:22:08] about it but she's a warmer preacher
[1:22:11] why because she had him under her thumb
[1:22:15] i ain't quite that blind
[1:22:18] my wife come tell me god come down
[1:22:20] baptize her in the bed i just tell her
[1:22:22] say honey you don't need a bass saturday
[1:22:25] you got your saturday bath but that's
[1:22:27] all you got
[1:22:30] you don't believe that to be done
[1:22:33] i don't believe you'll prop it up
[1:22:36] right it'll be right okay let's get
[1:22:39] through we're done
[1:22:41] before we end anybody have a need or
[1:22:43] something to be prayed for come up and
[1:22:46] let's pray
[1:22:47] and then we'll just go right on into the
[1:22:49] service
[1:22:50] and bring up everything and get
[1:22:52] everything done from here we're only
[1:22:54] going to have one service today so we
[1:22:56] don't have to be in no big hurry you
[1:22:58] know and all and we appreciate before i
[1:23:00] forget it to everybody
[1:23:03] of what you're doing the jobs you've
[1:23:05] done the things you've done the little
[1:23:07] bitty things
[1:23:09] god sees all of the things
[1:23:13] the little bitty things
[1:23:15] he sees them
[1:23:17] and now remember we're human as we try
[1:23:20] to
[1:23:21] uh do everything
[1:23:22] and we may miss somebody in their doings
[1:23:26] but but don't come up and say well well
[1:23:29] i i i done one time

[1:23:48] nobody

[1:23:51] right order and to do the best we can
[1:23:53] all right does anybody need any prayer
