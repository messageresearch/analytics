amen god bless you good to be in the house of the Lord we are assembled here together regardless of what the world's doing if you will take your seats for a second I've been trying to find a little something to say and I found it everybody believed Martin Luther was a man of God right he was a born-again prophet of God for his age right he was one of the seven stars so we can take some of the things that he says that's coming from the Lord and in all this coronavirus and all this stuff that's going on in the world we forget that Martin Luther was dealing with the Black Plague which killed almost a million and a half people just in Europe not just a coronavirus it's just getting started but and I want us to show due diligence we do not ever want a maka devil but they can't have control over us because we're children of God we have promises that the world don't have we have benefits that the world doesn't have so I'm gonna read to you what Martin Luther said when dealing with the black death play he wrote these wise words I shall ask God mercifully to protect us then I shall fumigate help purify the air now this is back in the 1500s administer medicine and take it I shall avoid places in persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance inflict and pollute others and so caused their death as a result of my negligence if God should wise to take me he'll surely find me if God should wise to take me he will surely find me and I have done what he has expected of me and so I am not responsible for either my own death of the death of others if my neighbor needs me however I shall not avoid place or person but will go freely as stated above see this is such a god-fearing faith because it is neither brash nor foolhardy and does not tempt God amen and if you want to read that yourself and hold on to it it's on Facebook under so you're a pastor's wife sorry but I thought that what I was trying to think of something and I was just flipping through Facebook actually I was looking to see if anybody heard anything about brother Donnie I heard that he was still in the hospital still having test run but it was not a heart attack of those either don't know brother Donnie kind of fell over last night and during his church service and they took him to the doctor and EKG reports nothing so now they're checking for other things that's the last I've heard so we must be doing something right because the devil sure on a rampage he's got brother on Spencer in the in the bed and he's got brother Donnie in the hospital and he had brother Dale off for a little while so we must be doing something right that's the way I look at it but let's do like Martin Luther let's not provoke oh let's not tempt God we're a god-fearing faith let's don't be brash but let's be diligent if our brother or sister needs us we go to him because I truly believe that that we are under the protection of God he protects his children first and then all those others after that and we'll get into that in just a little while because even in the journey of a believer there are benefits that we get there were benefits that Abram got Abram got benefits even when he was Abram all right so let's stand back up and we'll address the Lord here that's already in our mist I believe just a modicum brother Boyd's class practice at 12:45 everybody got that same man don't forget it because I might also like I said remember brother Dale remember brother run brother Donny Reagan and all the different ones that are that are under the weather next Sunday Lord willing I guess if the planes are still flying will be at brother clogs in Oklahoma also April the 18th will be our Spring Fling at the ballpark in in Gil's Ville we'll keep announcing that later on April the 19th that is the Sunday after we'll only have one service and it will be brother Dale's 80th birthday party that day so we'll have food catered in and a big old cake and all kind of stuff for brother down so if you have anything you want to give him bring it that day okay everybody got that all right remember June 18th through the 20th will be our Father's Day fishing trip remember that and also your sisters you have something planned that weekend also sue you have those if we were to interject ourselves in it we'd get it we mess it up so y'all just take care of it sisters know what they're doing right well just like brothers we know what we're doing okay so let's turn the galatians 3 we're going to continue on a journey of a believer as we were talking last sunday afternoon between some of the brothers i and i want to tell you something that happened yesterday right in the middle of delivering mail the lord can talk to you because you're sitting there by yourself and you might miss a few boxes but they'll get it next week it's usually bills anyway our census listen take that census test okay it's not the government wanting to find out they already know where you're at okay but take the census because what it does is though if we continue in Terry on it gives certain monies can go to your place or you get certain benefits from the government if you want to say that that may be a misnomer but get benefits from the government but they just don't want to worry your app they want to know the population B anyway so anyway while I was doing that you know I was meditating a little bit on this sermon this morning I like what brother Claude told me one time he said he said brother wait he said Sunday morning you need to preach he said cuz that's either new people you bring you know you bring a business turn Sunday morning because a lot of you don't come back Sunday afternoon so you can't bring a visitor if you don't come so anyway he said Sunday morning you preached to your people he said Sunday afternoon you teach because that's the ones that want to come back in here and then Wednesday night is your core of believers that always gonna be there and he's exactly right because you can see it you can see it everywhere you go so so today we're going to preach but I want to we're still gonna stay on the journey of a believer but I was just a vowel asked me one time several months ago she said by the way she said I'm so new so y'all know so much and this this message is so vast and and so much knowledge that I that I need that that I've come in have I come in too late and boy what a concern well it can have man sir it's a real concern because we don't have 20 years left or thirty years or in brother Dale's cases you know 40 or 50 years been in the message we don't have that to develop to get to this body change or a resurrection message or whatever we want to call it that we're and it's required for us to have it but I told sister vile I said you know what she's the absolute revelation of the 11th hour worker absolute revelation of the levinthal worker that levinthal worker was put in that Bible for you and me telling us that it doesn't matter the other ones worked 10 hours the 11th hour worker got paid the exact same amount of money as all of us I told us assists about you just make yourself available to God he'll pour it in because there's a promise you can take you can come back say God I'm 11th hour worker I've got to learn this message and let it be a part of my life faster than other people so I was driving down the road yesterday I was thinking of the young people all of our young people that are coming up that we're having these and they're asking some really honest and good questions I thought Lord Lord it's almost too late just like well you know I didn't think is this the Bible saying Lord is almost too late he said you tell him spoke to me just this plane he said you tell everybody he said I've come back to get you I'll come back to get you I will not leave my children alone I will come back and get them didn't go tell us that's what he's gonna do he said you tarry around here I'm gonna come back you show that's true that's when Jesus comes I thought he's already here amen so you just believe that God's he's come back to get you brothers like all you ones you young ones even even you hold her in body but younger in in heart he's come back to get you you just make yourself available though don't go off somewhere else and don't go off and stripes try to stay right here till this is where he promised you hit and meet you didn't meet you right here so young kids do not worry God has come back to get you he will not leave you nor Willie forsaken Galatians 3 verse 16 god bless your heart Damle father Lord we pray that you be with us today the property God preached the sermon the world falling apart Lord we see that the world is worried about all these different with the bride we're taught not to look sideways or or left or right but look up for our Redemption draweth nigh and our help cometh from above by the we pray that you'd be with each one protect us all Lord we know we have to rub elbows with the devil every day but Lord you told us you gave us benefits Lord you gave us promises even Abram walked through many many trials and tribulations but Lord he came out to be Abraham and took a body change and went on Lord to be one of the the only father of our faith we hear the word Abraham being spoken now four or five thousand years after he left the physical earth but Lord we know his faith is just as real as it was the day that he walked on the sands of this earth over in the Middle East father we pray that you'd bless each one take care of us these are trying times we pray Lord that the fear would be taken out of the people but that we would show due diligence as you told Martin Luther what to do lord I believe by the Holy Spirit of the way to handle these different things Lord we pray this you touch each one bless us now continuous on our journey Lord be with us in this service today and give us our daily bread in Jesus name Amen now we're talking about Abram but let's look in Galatians now this is Paul speaking of Abram but he's now Abraham Glacius 3:16 says now to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he says not into seeds of many because listen Abe Abraham had many children even after Sarah died he had seven more kids there recorded in the Bible but they're not recorded to be the children of promise alright so here we go the Isaac was the only seed naturally but we know that he wasn't even the spiritual seed of Abraham that Christ is the spiritual seed of Abraham and then you and I by receiving Christ we become the spiritual seed of Abraham because that's what it says right here he says not in the seeds as the many so not seeds as the flesh but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and I say that the covenant we talked about that last time excuse me that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after now remember Abram and Abraham that there was no law the law came in Moses they were just living under the best they could do coming from Abraham and all the way down through the people after the flood knowing all those people teaching them to do sacrifices and make an altar so the law didn't come till four hundred thirty years after Abraham says right here cannot dissin all that it should make the promise of none effect so it didn't matter if the law came the promise of God was going to be made manifested all right the law was put in because of transgression and we'll look at maybe later on this afternoon that the law was also put in to keep you clean keep him clean physically and spiritually right you're not dissing all that it shouldn't make the promise of none effect what was the promise Abraham was gonna have a promised seed for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise in other words if it's written down in the law if there's okay you get this you it's no promise the promise is but God gave it to Abraham by promise now let's go to Hebrews six verse 13 then you be seated for then God made promise to Abram Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself so in other words he didn't ask counsel of anyone he didn't ask what the devil thought about it he was his own counsel he didn't care what the devil said about it saying surely blessings I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured what Abraham after Abraham patiently endured he obtained the promise he'd be seated in Lord add his blessing the reading of the word as the Bible says those who endure to the end Abram endured to become Abraham you and I start our journey as a young Christian and we have to endure to become Abraham or the faith seed it wasn't called the faith seed of Abram it's called the faith seed of Abraham all right because he took on a different name he took on a name change you and I must take on the name change also so if you got your Bibles let's turn back to Genesis 12 if the brothers just want to carry through we'll just run through the scripture real quick because we talked about justification and I want to read you a few scriptures on justification and what God said about it we've been through this many times before but if you pull up Genesis 12 verse 1 just you'll just have to get off of that and then put up Genesis 12 kind of like we did last Sunday I'm sorry I threw that in on you but Genesis 12 while they're getting there let me tell you something about justification justification isn't is the work of the Holy Ghost and it's what God does not what you do because if you justify yourself think about it think about it people have tried to justify what they did and look at a mess that takes you to but then we look and see though that being justified freely that the just and the justifier is the same person that we you and I are just as just as God is everybody got that say Amen we are just as just as God is or he's a liar because he said to just and the justifier are the same all right so if we're justified by God then our sins are put in the sea of God's forgiveness never to be remembered again pull up Genesis 12 verse 1 there you go here we go now the Lord said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house now what's the first thing God's when he calls you what's the first thing God wants you to do separate yourself separate yourself from what you do what you did what all these things that that you used to do remember the song says the things I used to do I do them no more if you're still doing the things he used to do then you need to go back to ask the justifier to justify you not try to justify yourself all right everybody got that same in but now watch Abram Abram get up get out of your country and you'll come into a land that I will show thee I will show thee all right and I what's all these to all these eyes I've got him circled in my Bible in verse 2 and 3 watch this so it had to be nothing in Abram that was good you know although he's a Abram was just like his neighbor the only difference in Abram and his neighbor was when God called his neighbor the neighbor said I don't think I want to do that but Abram was the only one that God used during that time they said hey I'll do it no ain't that same way with you you come to a place where you say okay god I'm tired of running I'll do it because once he says look I will make I will make God says I will make of thee a great nation Abraham did not make itself a great nation God made him a great nation I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee let me have seen that in their life and we all have and and like something I'm sorry they went to the top and curse them that curse at thee we've seen that also and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed all families so Abram departed and I remember Abram is hi father he's not the father of Nations yet but he is starting a journey he does have a name you have a name that you become into the part of trying to do what God said you understand what I say I'm trying to do what God said all right but you didn't make a final decision one day and you said okay I'm leaving I'm leaving what I did the things I used to do I'd do them no more what does repent me repent means to turn and go into the opposite direction amen so Abram departed that the Lord had spoken unto him now his problem was and we were talking about last Sunday he took a lot with him that's pretty good play with words he did he took a lot with him I hope y'all got that life Sunday no I'm y'all a little slow but what he didn't say a lot come God didn't say take light God said Abram you get up you get out of this shape that you're in condition that you in and come and walk with me but why did Abram do Abram came out like I said before he took alot with him which God didn't tell him to do that but God allowed that because God allows you to take a lot with you when you leave because you're just justified the root of evil still there God has not done anything to put a spirit inside of you you've still got that old nature inside of you that old snake that older Demick nature Abram is still walking like a little kid in the candy store you don't really know what to do cuz look God's already said I'm gonna bless you bless your family bless the land you live on I'm going to give you this I'm gonna give you that and I'm going to bless even all the people in all the family in the earth it's gonna be blessed all families of the earth be blessed now there's the Covenant that God made but he didn't make it with Abram he made it with himself I just read it because he could swear by no other he swore by himself because the first company made he made is who were talking last Sunday unless winds and whatever was he gave the promise to Adam under condition Adam as long as you don't eat that tree right there you're fine okay that's conditional covenant that's a condition what did a what did Adam do Adam did what God said not to do he broke the covenant God said okay this is what's going to happen all right and we're still living under that now so that was pretty powerful because we're still living under the fall at the moment all right but the the condition that he put with Abram was I will I will bless thee I will do this all that I will I will I will I will I will so Abram is under a covenant Oh hallelujah Abram is under covenant he can't lose he can't lose because God made the covenant said i will make thee so we put a connection with abram that's why we're children of abraham we have that same blessing that the blessing of Abraham may fall on the Gentiles the Bible tells that's us so Abram departed lot went with him and remember that was a trouble that he had Abram was 75 when he departed just keep scrolling down and they remembered their Sarah now what does Sarah I mean at this moment Sarah means contentious oh my lord oh boy that's us oh boy that's nice he took Sarah with him but she's part of the plan she's part of the plan they took all these people and where did they go I told you that they they headed toward the land of Canaan which is the land of promise Canaan land is all of our the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's heading toward it he goes into it because remember justification is a work of the Holy Spirit it's not that you have it but if you're truly justified God is gonna those who is justified he's already that's weak those who is justified he's already so if God justifies you he's going to carry you through to glorification so they go into the land of Canaan you as a believer starts beginning to believe because you were an unbelievable or there and you start doing what you started doing what believers do you come to church you talk about the Bible you read the Bible you you you listen to messages you talk about God instead of talking about X Y Z whatever you you were talking about in Abram the same way because remember Abram under tradition it's not in the Bible but I was even looking on the internet the other day and even the Jewish tradition of Abram was he was an idol maker his father made idols and Abram made idols and sold them to people if you needed an idol for this you know 1995 you get two for one I don't know what you know even believe that's what he was doing so he wasn't in the plan of God at that moment but yet he was always in the plan of God you not have to remember one thing's for sure God knows who's gonna make it and who's not but we don't but we have to believe like Abram believed God enough to do something different he got up from that Idol making and that idol worship him and he left the position he was in same way with me and you if you're in the same position you were in you didn't get justified you might have justified yourself and started coming to church because like many people you look in the different I hate to say this but you know use the phrase you find Jesus in jail you know a lot of people do when they they just get caught just like the same way with the coronavirus you know y'all the churches that could go to church everybody's gonna come everybody's gonna presidents watching online right up in Gainesville Jenson Franklin right now as we speak why because people get scared and what's the first thing they do I had a cousin talk to me yesterday him and his wife wants to come up Church up here but he's afraid that we might be a snake handler or something but his wife has cancer so it makes you start thinking different but he's heard all the stories about us til us we don't get him out till after y'all leave I don't get them out when unbelievers that's why the unbelievers are in the mess we don't get them out but in any way but people are looking for things but now Abram wooden folks were you looking for God before he spoke to you to come to a place no neither was Abram he was setting his a little comfortable house he had a bunch of nice comfortable little friends that did what he did right right that did what he did and everything was comfortable and cozy there was no you know the economy was good the sale of the of the gods were good and we're all doing good and all of a sudden God says you need to go into a different place you need to get up and move if you're gonna be a child of mine you're gonna have to just get up and move you're going what what comfort blanket I got all this comfort I got the comforts of what what go charge we may go to church Bible let me see if I find it I mean really Abram was not thinking about God but Abram was chosen because God knew by predestination that he would choose the right thing that's the same way with you and I we can't kick you out we can't bring you in because that's like Martin Luther said if God's ready to take you and that don't mean always death but he said he'll find you and God found us doesn't matter you know wherever we were but he knew Oh Abram was sitting there in that comfort you know he was in that nest and he had all that feathers around him and he was all nice and and all of a sudden God just throws the nest out of the tree and Abraham's up on a limb you know what do you had to do you had to make a decision you and I have to make a decision to listen to what God said and move that don't mean physically move but spiritually move into something that you've never moved in you go whoa what in the world we you know listen drugs and alcohol and sex and all those different things that people do in the world that want on things that they do in the world mm-hmm it's just a fulfillment of what you and I feel today of the presence of God pulling us into a spiritual relationship with God they replace that brother Graham says they replace that desire with XYZ and that's what we do even as Christians we replace sometimes not by all that but we play we replace it by something and what to do when you replace something it brings you further away from God when you start inserting things in here Abram had a lot of God's inserted in here but God said hey you need to get up move so when you move it brings a whole new atmosphere and like I said last week if you can't relate to this if you can't see it in your in your Christian walk don't matter if it's fifty years twenty years or two months you must see that this is how God works and I thank God for it because it's for everybody he doesn't treat one this way in one this way and one better than the other because cuz you know sister cleaner could be back there and she could say I saw the Prophet you know what I can say to her Bible says blessed is he that has not saying more blessed and see if it has not seen why because we took the Bible she saw the Prophet but you know what she done she walked on with God she walked on with God and she's been walking all these years with God and we don't worry about people like that what we worry about people that it's like the wind they flow in they flow out now look Abram went to different places but he was on a journey he never went back to the earth childî it was never recorded he went back to his father's house why because if you do that then you didn't get justified you just thought you how to get feeling I'm going to read where brother Brown tells us that in Ezekiel remember in Ezekiel he gives you a new heart takes out the stony heart put a heart of flesh and he gives you a new spirit well we'll talk about that if we ever get into the sanctification where he gives you a new spirit but it's not the Holy Spirit no it's not the Holy Spirit but what does it do it puts you in a religious order it brings you to a place to where you realize I'm in a different place but let's go through this we gotta we gotta get back to justification just for a minute is that okay so Abram passed through the land I wanted to get back up here cuz I got all these written in my Bible now look so he went into Canaan but what happened to Abram let's go to verse 7 and the Lord appeared unto Abram now listen in your journey that's why I'm breaking this down that's why I believe God told me yesterday I've come to get the little ones I've come to get the ones that needs more explanation of how to get the new birth not just sending a message Church and die now I just sitting and feel good and everything is good and I like that song cuz it gives me a chill that has nothing to do with Christianity the Lord appeared now somewhere in your journey even in justification God has got to appear to you because he said he would if he truly justified you the justifier is that close now he's not inside yet but he's that close to you he has come to you the Lord came to Abram and appeared to him now I'm not gonna go so far as to say a peer to him in physical form but you know what God appeared to me yesterday but it was a thought in my mind that was so clear that is what God was doing so God appeared to me and the Lord appeared unto Abram now Abram he's still dirty he's still got a lot with him but God knows that you need the guidance in your journey that's why I said he's gonna be so close to you all the way but then now I'm telling you you get to where you get to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you get on into this thing several years into your life and we can't be baby from the more we can't be looking for God all over the place to be you understand what I mean he wants you to grow up because you told Abraham he said when he comes to circumcision he really does he appears to him as Melchizedek and then Abraham from there to taking Isaac up and being offered up on an altar his only son there was a gap in between there well you don't hear a lot that God did a lot for Abraham Noah Abraham what Abraham was already on his walk he knew what he was doing he knew where he was going here this promised son right here with him he could see him physically so that was the promise same way you and I have the spiritual promises of God and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed now watch now watch what he's gonna tell Abram now you didn't tell him before he just said good get up leave all right go into Canaan and hang on there he appears to Abram and says unto thy seed will I give this land and there builded an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him so Abraham Abram thought so much of that piece of ground he built an altar and he worshiped God now where's the altar we know the altars in our heart but we also need to stay listen you come to a state of justification I couldn't wait for the doors to open the church because I wanted to be around somebody that I wasn't around before to me this is safety this is the safe house of God if you don't if you feel uncomfortable today being here in this room listening to me or anybody else you got a problem you right then you feel uncomfortable a long time you told us you did you felt I mean here's a here's a young branch that has just grown from the tree not that tree but the tree of God we'd rather him we drive grab him grow out of the free of God then we know where he came from but but you don't kids you say I'm just wasting my time sitting here and I don't want to do this I'd rather be on Facebook I'd doesn't be talking to my friends and I'd rather be doing listen when I get done I'm gonna put my makeup on and I'm gonna pull my pants up and guys I'm gonna I'm gonna get with my buddies and we gonna tomorrow we gonna go you're not justified you're not justified you're justifying yourself for the ways of not wanting to be here um I don't like there's not a lot of things you know it today at this very moment I can't think of one thing I'd want to do besides doing this right I mean if you're when I was a sinner though mama would say you need to come Church so I'd come on Mother's Day and Christmas I was the C&E crowd the Christmas and Easter crowd let's just be honest I hated it Wow I wasn't then I wasn't an eagle yet he said oh well you always weren't please people please please I was a chicken I got converted into an eagle hold our brother bouncing hold on a minute brother Brown told us in one quote he said I always was a wheat plant I've got 22 other quotes that says I had to be changed from a cuckoo bird to a wheat plant what's he saying you got to go through a change that's what Abram did now Abram totally had to take a change to get into another place because he wasn't where God want him to be you were not where God wanted you to be if you're out there in the world and I tell you from an honest heart God will if you're a child of God at this point in time God is obligated to stir you up because you no one else is going to do it your mama can't save you your daddy can't save you brother Dale can't save you the strong leader can't save you playing good music don't save you God saves you but you got to do the things he tells you to do unto thy seed will I give this land and there builded he an altar and he removed from thence into a mountain on the east of Bethel the words Bethel exactly him house of God and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and high on the east and there he builded an altar to the Lord look he's always built an altar what's an altar obedience and they built an altar to the Lord he called upon the name of the Lord go to the next talk about Beth Doyle go to verse 10 this is where we were at Sundy go to verse 10 that may have to pull it back up because that's not the normal oh I like this but you can go to the Bible if you want to brother but we're gonna be doing this all through the journey of Abraham now what happened in verse 10 problems I'll promise you problems I'll raise it up a little bit more so so free to the short let people can see it and there was a but listen I'll promise you though here's Abram Abraham's got it going to the land of Canaan you think oh man this guy this is good I'm not with my friends anymore but now remember remember one thing you still got the devil inside of you God has not control of the inner person yet if I got that say Amen God does not have control he that old root of evil that ol Adamic nature that old fallen nature that nature you had you still got you got it because you're still going to lean to it because what happened the first time a virus that our famine comes in other words Abraham's and Canaan he's we're supposed to be well I can't eat anymore I got all these problems so I'm gonna let's go back into the world because God must not be with me that's not what God look Abram went into Egypt because the famine remember I told you what is the famine do it moves you it makes you make a choice but now he didn't make the right choice and not making the right choice he went down and the first thing you did was went back to lion again you had a lot lot didn't you that's okay I said you did after a lot a lot to cover a lot of things up you have to lie specially when you got Christian parents ladies and gentlemen hello I mean really yeah start lying cuz you guys start covering stuff up again cuz you go right back into doing it for the famine was Grievous in the land Oh Satan's gonna make you make a choice he's gonna say your mind still but what is this little white light to keep following you around what's this little power that I then I feel that I felt back before the foundation of the world but I'm feeling again what are you doing you're my greatest soldier you're my go-to guy when I need something done wrong right do that going yet oh I had the babies and I got scars to prove it too and then we all got scars of the things we did in our past but they're a reminder to me what God's done to me that what God did not what I decided listen listen Alcoholics Anonymous all those self-help things are good but unless God comes into your soul and burns that old nature out you will do it again cuz they tell you even in a a they say wants a drunk always a drunk now that's not true in Christianity once a sinner always a center that ain't something I want to attach myself to I want to attach myself to the same killer Moses turn around look he said you see them people in Egypt he said after today you'll see them no more that's the same way with you and I you and I cross over Jordan we look back sure you can look back because you look back and you see and God's gonna say that right there you're not going to see that anymore cuz I brought you to a place when he came to pass when he came near into Egypt now remember it here's the story I'll go through it real quick he comes up and Sarah is still a pretty lady so he starts lying and tells them to say this is my sister but he's not doing it to save Sarah look look Sarah I was going what do you mean save your neck you fiction again we've been mad for 70 years and you fixin to give me to it in that's the way we are though look we're still in we're still in bondage under that old Adamic nature so we're going to lie cheat steal them do everything we used to do and gonna do it here Pharaoh just long as you don't kill me you can have my wife because she's my sister but watch what God did though in the two times that ABR Abram did it and Abraham did it that two times he did god never this is going hard to be hard to take God never punished Abram God never punished Abraham because he was under the promise he never did he plagued Egypt twice hey he closed up all the wounds in the land have any more children until you go back babe and I'm sure that guy's going that's not my problem that man lad but you know what God said though you look up at the top where I read you he said I will bless you and whatever I bless I'll bless you and once around you and whatever I curse or whatever you curse it'll also be cursed alright so they fell under a curse because even in your walk of justification if it's of God if it's of God God's with you because if he justified you in took you to glorification there's a journey there and he knows you're gonna make it to the end of that journey you and I don't but he does and then there Gyptians he talks about all that and then the lord of mercy that gets in all kind of trouble verse 17 and the Lord plagued Pharaoh in his house with great plagues because of Sarah Abraham what listen God's gonna plague this world because of you he's already pronounced plagues on this world because of me and you because my people are there I'm gonna reign plagues down on them on the earth remember what Pharaoh did Pharisee then get out of here look at chapter 13 now I don't know if we're gonna get the sanctification or not but we'll just continue on let's go to chapter thirteen and Abram went out of Egypt finally he gets out and all the hand he took but remember he took a lot with him and we were talking about this last last Sunday because what happened was as God was blessing Abram so much told that lot God that he had with him was being blessed too because He blessed the whole family's and I'm gonna bless your family but there had to come a time though to wear that God separated them God said okay sue Abram he went on his journey from South even to Bethel to place worse tent now watch he comes right back to the place and he made an altar of 13-3 just keeps going up to 4 to 13 for under the place of the altar which had made that first and there abram call them name Lord now listen in your journey you're continuing to call one name of the Lord it's not just well I got called and I'm this special seed person and they can't nothin bother me and you know if I don't go to church couple Sunday that's all I finally read my Bible I saw it I'm a chosen know you've just justified yourself because the just and the justifier is the same person and if God tells you this is the way you got to be then we got to fit that there Abram called on the name of the Lord and a lot also which with him had flocks and herds and tents and the lamb was not able to bear them they had to come a place like we were talking about in your journey even in justification brother Branson you'll go right back to the beer joint yes you will what he said you'll go right back to that why because that old root of bitterness that over it of evil that old laminates are still there you still got that same desire but you've decided that you're gonna do what God said right but there comes a time in that justification journey that you gonna have to separate from what you did before and there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abraham's cattle herding them lost all them demons get to fighting each other in the Canaanites and the perizzites dwelling and then in the land and Abram said unto life let there be no strife I pray thee between men the end between my herdsmen the herdsmen but we be brethren because remember a lot was his brother you gotta remember a lot wasn't some just poor thought idiot the Bible said he had to write your soul but remember he didn't come out like Abram did because he wasn't the chosen seed of Abraham he's gonna be the foolish virgin he's gonna be the one that has to be given eternal life he's going to be the national person that lives the best life he can live and God will give him eternal life because of his works not because he's a child of God Abraham types me and you so there had to be a separation a point in time somewhere tell me rose that same way with me me and you both there was a time when I was and they'll test you all I had friends they tested me let's go hunting when you're gonna leave oh we're gonna leave on Friday that's good okay I'll ride with you we're coming back Sunday afternoon you know the old me used to say I was fine I don't care Sunday's another day on the calendar and everybody else is going to church there's not as much traffic on the road and weeding deer hunt and we can come back home but they test you though they said no we're gonna come back on Sunday you know what you say what do you say now that you didn't say then you say no I'll Drive I'm coming back Sunday night because I'm going to church cuz you know what they're watching you they're watching you fervently watching you and wanting you to make a mistake cuz that's the devil the devil is wanting you to make a mistake but God is there close with you to help you like you did with Abram Abram comes to light and says alright light I've carried a lot oh I won't carry I'm not carrying a lot in the more me and you go separate you pick your land and I'll take what's left over in that guard you pick if you cuz you know what he's gonna get the seemingly greener pasture the drugs alcohol the stacks the women there so that of this just name it whatever it is oh it's so wonderful out there in the world it just tickles you flesh right but there comes a time though when Abram comes on the scene and lot is right here and Abram says I'm not gonna do that anymore but you pick whatever green pasture you want and Lauda is always gonna pick it's a little comical but I'm some of you already fell asleep too early in the morning great I read a book one time says the grass is always greener over the septic tank think about it what's making it green hmm good you know they always say the grass is always greener on the other side the grass is always greener the guy was making a point he said the grass sees through the grass you see the screen and growing this usually got underneath pushing today it's like the way the world is God's going to give them these things gonna give you a real green pasture he's going to give you the plains of Sodom and Gomorrah there's plenty of water oh there's all kind of good stuff for my cattle and my drinking and my and I got room to do it the least we had room to do it that way yes sir listen we ought listen folks even you young kids we did not come from diaper babies 250 years old we went through same devil same demons they may just come at you a little bit different than they did us because we didn't have Internet's and all this other stuff but we had the same thing you had but we could do it in secret now it's all open same way with us we've talked about this coronavirus me and brother Joe worth it you hear of all these other viruses a long time ago and you didn't hear much now with social media as soon as they hit China hit the whole world so it made the whole world upset so everybody wash your hands a great plague in the land washing in listen his fear folks fear look land was not able to bear him there was a strife verse 8 we are brethren verse 9 Abram was looking I may not get to all of it that's ok Abram was looking at the same land what was looking at but Abram had enough sense I say God since because he you have you can you contract a guard sense even in justification because you're heading towards something ok so you have a God sense or a God direction so he said and you know you don't hear Abram crying I wanted that no he said lot you picked them but you pick whatever you want I'll go in this other direction that's why they call it repentance I'm going this way lot you go that way and that's what happened look a lot lifted up his eyes all the plains of Jordan and it was plenty of beer joints and you understand what I'm saying that's what was pulling light that wasn't what was pulling Abram it was pulling lot back into it because look the journey of light is a journey of someone else besides Abraham look what happened a lot in his he's got a pretty brother branham calls it a hair in the biskits lineage because he had relations with his two daughters and had mobitz and he said they were here in the biscuit you know what that is a gaggy thing he said I'm just telling you what brother Brown so you know what he said brother right he's the gay they did a gag I know brother raised her read it before lot lift this up his eyes have beheld all the plain of Jordan it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the Garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt it's now coming son to the door then a lot chose him all the plains of Jordan and lot journeyed East and they separated himself one from another and Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan last word God told him to go and lock dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot will set book the God God started talking a little bit more serious to Abram when a lot left him now God talked to him but listen when listen even in your journey and you take your journey you start getting rid of all that you did the things I used to do I don't do them no more I don't go listen to this kind of music anymore I don't go visit that friend anymore I don't crawl out my window so I can go party at night a long time ago right we've all done these things but we don't do it no more we come to a place where we don't do that anymore we've separated ourselves from that what is not important anymore Abram thought what was important because he brought with him he thinks wow you know you want in a right day you want to save everybody listen when you come into this fellowship of God and you come into this place I'm back here so y'all won't fall asleep anymore I'm telling him I've been fasting during the middle of the day and I'm feeling so much better feeling so much better talking about them brother Branham used to do that he's stopping his sermons start singing song what's problem in it but look we come to a place in justifications where we have to see that those things that we thought we could bring with us you can't bring them anymore you know I'm sure that guy was the same way man come to church women you can hunt Monday through Saturday but if you'll just come to church with me one time no Lord says no I think I'm gonna go back to what I was doing I like that greener pasture it looks better it feels better I don't have to come under conviction Yeah right come into the house of God this is a sin killing place amen and the Lord centered Abram after the after that lot was separated from me lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward now look you would think God would not tell him to look eastward because if you look up here in the scripture before lot went toward these so you would have thought well that's Lots land no God owns it all and he's gonna give it Abram all of it he's not hearing even listen this is what God said God said I don't care for a lot when he's not a son and daughter of God he's gonna go to Sodom I know he is but I know you're not because the Lord said unto Abram after a lot left him lift up your eyes and look north south east and west for all the land which thou sayeth now April sitting there going their God the green pastures of Jordan and those two beautiful cities now you give them to what God's like temporarily temporarily because your friends in the world have a temporary place to live you and I don't have a temporary place to live we have a permanent place to live and it's right here when you look north when you look south you look east and west Abraham for the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth he's 75 years old only have one child looks like he's getting a little late in life but you know what he believed Abram it was a believer that's why God picked Abram because he knew Abraham would believe it and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it in the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee and Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plains of Mamre which is in Hebron and built a builded altars a from faithful he goes Church he does what God tells him to do now Genesis 14 we'll see what happened in Genesis 14 real quick you don't even have to put it up before what happened was Locke got in trouble now look your friends may get in trouble out in the world it's okay to go help them but folks listen it's always gonna be on Sunday or Wednesday evening now that's that's not your friend's fault that's the devil testing you but Abram finally found a place to go out and help his brother life but remember what happened what happened he didn't go out with lot and stay there the Bible says coming back from the slaughter of the king coming back from the slaughter of the king he was met by Melchizedek somewhere in your journey even in justification God is obligated to meet you a God in human flesh he's on Apple's well there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there there there there there's one here's one looking for you looking for a priest to walk out of the woods no you're looking for God in human flesh that's what Abram and Abram met God in human flesh and he blessed him and said blessed be Abram blessed be that black he had started a journey then I've been wanting him to be over a long time same with me and all of us possessor of heaven and earth the Bible fair verse 19 and blessed be the Most High God which that delivered thine enemies into thy hands and he gave him tithes of all in your journey you're gonna come to a place to where you're gonna start doing things of God and you're gonna get closer and your walks gonna get closer you walk can't get further away your walks got to get closer and closer and closer amen now let's go before we go to Genesis 15 let's read a few scriptures let's go to Roman's 3 now you can go back to the I hope somebody's back there I looked in Anderson sitting here yeah go back you're good we got time Romans 3 verse 24 through 26 and then Romans 3 verse 24 through 26 being justified nope you got to go back to where it says justification on my note big words and justifications in Genesis 12 it's a it's Romans 3 verse 24 right up it the first right after brother Branham talks on who is this Melchizedek and didn't read this one but you should know it there you go that brother brown said every son of the faith that comes to this through this journey has to walk this you have to walk this same journey of Abraham that's why he was our example in hood this milk hesitate paragraph 65 he said every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing Abraham did you'll go through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost meet God take communion and then along in your life you're going to be tested which I'm about adoption next next month on the Bible study in adoption God took Abraham to a place and said sacrifice your son all that I'll give you kill it and Abraham walked right up and was getting ready he was gonna absolutely cut the throat of his of his only son and God stopped him he said oh I know you're in a position now that I can deal with you same way with you and I but you got to go through justification now he didn't send him he didn't send Isaac in justification in the first part of this journey listen in the first part of his journey he absolutely knew that God said you're blessed God said I'm gonna give you this I'm gonna give you that but didn't tell him how he never said now your name is gonna be changed Sarah is gonna be changed to Sarah and you're gonna have it to her because remember in sanctification he makes a bad mistake he thinks Hagar can do it and Hagar is outside of the plant what she's in the plan but she's outside of the real plan Isaac was not gonna come through her he was gonna come through the free woman not the bondwoman alright we'll talk about that later on but let's get this right here and then we'll stop lord of mercy well maybe we'll do sanctification this afternoon romans 3 verse 24 i hope it's not born you cuz you know what it even revives what's in me we want to go through the revival then you sit down and think about Abram and think about Abraham when you think about all these people that went through these journey didn't even have the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet they did what God said the Bible tells us being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set for it to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood the faith of Abraham to declare his righteousness not your own for the remission of sins that are past remember Grace's for what you did no what you're gonna do there is no grace for what you're going to do you need grace for what you did hey man grace is not for futures for past sins through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus he's a just and the justifier of him who him this guy which believeth in Jesus all right let's go to Ezekiel we're going to read this and then we'll talk just about five minutes on sanctification then that's what we'll start this afternoon therefore say this is EQ 11 through 17 through 19 thus saith the Lord I will even gather you from the people now what's he doing he's taking he's taking Abram out he's gathering him from the people he was in he's gathering you from the world listen worse we have to be a separated people I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where you been scattered and I will give you the land of Israel and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof did God not take the detestable things away from you he sure did me you look back and see the things y'all used to do and I used to do and we all used to do their detestable I told God yesterday I said I sure hate that I think that that I can remember what I did you know what he said I don't that's how he can be the justifier he can't justify you if he can remember what you did simple as that but how profound and they shall consider and shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations there are for what the land this land and I will give them one heart listen there's only one your birth there's only one journey of a new born again Christian that's true justification sanctification in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you now look we're heading toward sanctification that's not in justification justification is this right here I will take the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh he is taking you on a journey to sanctification because what is sanctification cleaned and set aside for service right cleaned and set aside for service everybody got that say a man and then we look in chapter don't put anything up tonight this afternoon in Chapter 15 and 16 is sanctification the Bible says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision he's getting closer you never ever say a vision in Abram during justification but when you head into sanctification the Bible says I'll give you a new spirit and remember it's not the Holy Spirit the Bible in brother Ram tells you there's a spirit that you can deal with that God can deal with listen God can't deal with you and justification he really didn't deal with Abraham he just kind of guided him you see all the mistakes Abram ate God didn't guide him into Egypt he left to win himself same way with you and I you know you you get you can be justified and leave and come back cuz remember that's the very outer core you can walk out of the court you can walk back in the court but remember that journey has got to take you to the next step or you're not Abram all right it's got to take you to the next step but remember sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit and it's a washing of the water of the word remember the unclean spirit goes out we'll talk about this afternoon just kind of give you a little something but I want to say something real quick about this journey when we head into st. duplication real quick hey all right I've never thought about this I was thinking yesterday too after the Lord had impressed on me about that you ever realize the Bible tells us and we'll read them this afternoon but I want to read them now Psalm 68 19 says blessed be the Lord who daily load with us with benefits daily loaded not loathe load like to load you up Psalm 103 to bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits what shall I render unto the Lord Psalm 116 12 what shall i render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me and the scripture says that I can be saved in other words by the salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ but look at the benefits you ever thought about this we look at disease in affliction brother Joe and I were talking about this a few minutes ago you look in the Bible in the Bible in an Old Testament they would be a plague go through the land and it would kill so many thousand people but remember it was always after they disobeyed God always after they disobeyed God there'd be a plague go through Aaron road run through with the century but by the time Aaron got finished they'd be six thousand eight thousand thirty thousand twenty thousand people would die what was God doing you think all them people were good people no they were the bad ones God don't clean the earth of good people he claims the earth the bad people don't remember God - just God and being just he has to have justice but you think about diseases and afflictions now I'm not talking about just for about five minutes just us we're just here talking this is the journey of a believer and I believe we got the benefits and we've got the promises now you take somebody like brother Dale that had something done on the shoulder that's not a disease that's the cause of the fall and what's causing the fall me and Jim we talked about this the other day what's causing the fall what we eat God curse the ground and everything we eat won't tell us a hundred times in his message our food is killing us okay so an affliction or you got this or you got you know something I'm talking about a disease a communicable disease that can go from one person to the next like we're talking about the corona virus or whatever but do you know if you're a born-again Christian today the Bible says you're clean it's all that's the soul well in the Bible in the Old Testament it told people hey if you find a dead body and you touch that dead body what does it tell you to do wash not because God said so because God was trying to protect the people he said go wash and and don't do anything until evening why he was letting that disease out of there cuz he knew we'd have them but listen to this I just wrote some of these down you know if you're a born-again Christian and you save yourself young people listen to me are you listening to me how vital it is to keep yourself before marriage because communicable diseases come from sex outside of marriage period right so if you're a pure man and a pure woman and you get mad never have to go to a clinic never have an unwanted pregnancy I'm just talking I'm just telling you what is our benefit of being a born again I said born-again Christian all communicable diseases will be gone if you don't smoke or drink or anything like that all those diseases that come with that they go away all right why do people have liver disease they drink okay now they may be things listen they may be cases you say in your merry life no I'm talking about overall children of Israel two million people plus the mixed multitude when into Egypt and the Bible says it wasn't a feeble man among them that they did not CVS and Walmart going with them I'm like brother Branham I'd like to know what Moses had in that script bag that was on his side you know what he had he had God he told the people he said if you won't read the Bible if you do anything unclean don't wash this is not an old theory go wash and separate yourself for a little while what to get that disease out of there there'd be no divorce court divorce lawyers would have to instead of playing golf they'd have to be the golf graham keeper no abortion clinics you see what you as a Christian and you as young adults I value any person that saves themself all of us did it have scars before yeah go ahead give yourself all of us it all people that have scars before you can tell the people it's not worth it it's not worth it for the moment sin may be worth it you may think it's not worth it you can look I made a whole list I'm not gonna read a monk of this 1146 that atomic clock but most viruses and all a lot of anything that is communicable if you're a born-again Christian think about how clean you are today so I say think about how clean yard just by being a born-again Christian you come in here you don't have smoke all over you you don't have to go home and you and you know you breathing smoke which what it messes you lungs up and then you're susceptible for what it's just a snowball effect you're susceptible for other diseases and your death and your that it goes on and on heart disease and all these different things but if you're a born-again Christian today look that's why I said he loaded us with benefits that the world is out there going crazy at the moment because they don't understand and they're afraid by touching somebody's nose or face or or you didn't wash your and not don't forget not as benefits now listen we all got scars we all got problems we all got things but listen if you're born again today you're the cleanest people on the face of the earth and if you're not born again and you have those scars you know what God can clean you up there is no sin except blasphemy that God can't save I think about that Georgia car tonight Jordan Carter was one that was the drunk somebody help me Rosella thank you I knew Paul Harvey you know Rosella Rosella a Street prostitute an alcoholic and you know what all that went with it brother Brown says now she's a clean woman now sure you got all that in the past that she may have to deal with but if you'll believe what God said the things I used to do I'd do them no more because God would put them in the sea of God's forgetfulness let's stand to our feet musicians come but you're clean Jesus even told me not for me said you're clean but not all why because one man wasn't the look folks no amount of water though it's gonna wash an evil spirit off of you okay now regular water may keep you from getting communicable diseases and viruses and all these different things but the greatest virus in the world is the one that comes from the inside told it will infect you and affect you if you're not born again you're not under that protection you're susceptible to everything when Locke went down to Sodom Lord look what he look what he he tried to give us two daughters away to save his skin and to save those two messengers that were down there he actually was gonna let them be fornicated with with these men and women to save his self and the Angels because he had put himself in that position you never see Abram or Abraham having to make that kind of a decision why because he was under the promises of God he was under the benefits of God and you and I are not under it listen I like what Brunel said one time God's not obligated to keep the devil's children clean he's not obligated to sell say the devil's killed kids and he's not obligated to adopt the devil's kid cuz they're the devil's kids but we have been transferred by the power of God from the devil's children to the children of the Almighty God so we live under his benefits we live under his promises we're going to look at Abram that's going to be changed to Abraham and watch how close God gets to him we'll see that this afternoon listen we need to walk closer with God then we've ever walked before and we'll read will start in sanctification and we'll start in chapter 15 of the book of Genesis god bless you let's sing a song you love the Lord [Music] [Music] there is power in the name of Jesus so what break every chain

Jesus have I not done this in this instance he said depart from me you weren't my children even though they called on the name but the power in the name is what you got inside of you it's the ability this is gonna be a little juice everybody go [Music] where is Jesus now we're all brother Brahim told us we're all we're all miss Jesus the hope the Bible says all the whole family in heaven and earth is named Jesus so where's the power at the power is and you believe in that you're part of it and it's not some Jesus over here somewhere sitting on the throne back up in the seventh dimension and you can't get to it I thought he said I'm gonna come back and I'm not gonna just be with you I'm gonna be in you and there's the power you know the disciples were giving a little bit of power when Jesus was here but it was temporary it was temporary power cuz he even give that to Judas to do the things you know kind of start Devils and preach and all that but when he came back on the day of Pentecost he took that power and he directly put it in 120 people that Dunamis power that creative power that you and I can lay our hands over and our kids can lay our hands on our car on our house and say God by the power of Jesus Christ I claim why do brother mom tell us to apply the token the token in the end time is the message of the hour but where's the message of the hour in books and tapes that's words on a page and voices going out but you and I if that voice comes out and it's the same voice brother Brown said the same loud voice that said Lazarus come forth with one day speak when thou Jesus is not gonna be on this earth when the resurrection happens physically Jesus is not gonna be standing on the earth you and I are so the voice of the resurrection has got to come through you and I let's pray for a resurrection we're praying for a revival let's pray for a resurrection let's pray for God to keep us clean read about the benefits and the promises of God reading them even in the Old Testament he guided those Israelites and kept them clean 2 million they were in one place for forty years and God was always cleaning them out he was always keeping everything going so you don't think God can take care of you yes he can because you and I are a son and daughter of God let's bow our heads the Heavenly Father we pray Lord that what we said this morning has been pleasing to you Lord I believe you when you spoke yesterday Lord it just put in another little sparkle maybe a revival in my heart Lord to speak about this walk of a journey of a believer into all the benefits that go with it father we pray that you'd be with each one Lord may this sickness and whatever we that comes on we've had sicknesses for thousands of years lord I just pray that we'll take these things is as you said through Martin Luther Lord let's not be let's not be frivolous and let's not be boastful and not tempt God but Lord we'll take what you said that will forget not your benefits that you'll take care of this group of believers and there is a little bride an army rising up in the end time to destroy the effects of the devil probably give us this day our daily bread I believe you have Lord I pray that you'd be with us now to go eat a natural food and be back in a couple hours that you'll take care of us Lord in our body keep us strong and bless us ever in your word in the name of Jesus Christ we pray hey man you're dismissed [Music] there is power [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music]
