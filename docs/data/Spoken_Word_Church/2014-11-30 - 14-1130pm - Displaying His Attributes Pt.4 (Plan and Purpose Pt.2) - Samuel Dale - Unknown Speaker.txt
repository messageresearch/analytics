to turn in your scriptures back where we were this morning to Matthew 19 we will read that and try to continue our thought click the fan on if you will read it's kind of Stuffy like so remember now bible study this coming Saturday 6:00 remember the Christian I mean the Christmas time together on December the 14th uh one service that day remember they service here on December the 24th that's on Wednesday because of you and Christmas and remember the watch Night Service will be on the 31st and that brother uh William Bor Leon will be here preaching for us and remember now that I say to you prepare to sing or to test testify or whatever you know cuz we'll only have a like start at 8:00 we always do sing about 30 minutes and then we go into the uh Services you know and then we wind up uh whatever is left time over from there at midnight remember the food now I don't know who's supposed to take care of who on what side of what but everybody just make sure we got something to to eat for the Christmas time together and then if you always want to bring something for the watch Night Service we always gather a little early and that way we can kind of Fellowship you know and do and does anybody remember what side brought we can't figure out they can't figure out who brought the rolls last and who brought the this brain rolls on both sides and sweets on both no that's too much this said so one side okay we make our choice this side done the road okay so this side does the rolls and that side does the sweets uh you got that brother collie okay okay somebody needs to keep up with all of this doing but just remember that remember to pray for brother Aaron he called me this morning and I was praying for him but he said he U had what was it uh reflux reflux was his main problem and all but just remember him in your prayer he call back because we believe it the Lord will take care of anything else Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace and your love thank you for all things and we just ask you now that you'd come on the scene with us this afternoon and be with us father and help us to try to speak exactly what you'd have for us Lord and we gave us these things and we wrote them down but yet that's still not the whole thing but because we still try to follow what you want us to say we ask you to just have your way with us forgive our sins be be with those that are traveling today and all Lord Wade and June Bob and Monica n and and Ryan and the different ones and just remember the sick remember Brother Gary Lord his feet swelled up we pray that you'd touch him because we believe you thank you for all things we love you and we Praise Your Great Name and that name is Jesus amen all right we'll try to continue our thought with this morning you know had to kind of change around I guess you noticed that a little but company being here but we do that because that you just not going in a straight line and and things and they can that way you don't have to leave them dangling and uh wondering what you're talking about all right now verse three but what I want you to do now is to do what I said this morning notice Jesus answered their question but do you think they believed it do you think they accepted what he said no no they didn't and you will not accept anything that said until the Lord shows you the truth TR that's right because you're going to be that little word we call stubborn you know but none of us are stubborn we don't have any problems with that but we are going to stay ourselves until God reveals it and I'm glad of that because that way it's not somebody trying to figure it out for us all right but we've got to we do that because that's human being you can put down like I said you could take a topic and you could give brother brandham in a Bible brother random in the Bible and every one of them be thus saith the Lord you know on a topic one God or something and you could put down a quote thus sayith the Lord Bible thus sayith the Lord quote thus sayith the Lord you could do every one of them and that's not going to convert you it won't change you and that's the power of persuasion it it won't change you because you'll always come up with takes one year you know like this brother used to say I'd talk with him for hours and he say but why did he say it I mean you spend hours trying to express it and it the same point why did he say it well but remember it has to be revealed right there is no good the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twine shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twine but one flesh but therefore God ha joined together let not man put a under they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away like I said the only one you've got there is a connection back with Deuteronomy 24 you know to uh expressing it right he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoo Marth her that is put away does commit adultery you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to try to uh I said I took this morning kind of a split part and wasn't going to get into the fornication adultery this morning but I had to put it in to make sure the you know the visitors would understand us and not just be a line that they go away and wonder what's going on now but I want you to understand one thing that as I said polygamy was instituted or allowed to come into being permitted but that was not God's original plan because his original plan was for us to been born without sex without any problem all right but he knew we would not be that way so he takes that that has been done by mankind in his permissive will and he turned it and T may you know used it to bring forth and will bring forth his perfect will brother randam said when we get into the Millennium he says there he will be standing as one with a many many membered body but says that will be only one body right all right see now that you can't explain that without going through the scriptures as I tried to express the thought and we more now to try to understand because remember in the body of Christ we are the body of Christ all right now then that being that then it's a many membered body called the bride all right see then being that part then polyg was not an attribute I hope you followed that point polygamy was permitted but not an attribute it was permitted for a type all right and permit it as a type then you know you can't make two rights or two wrongs be one right you know you you've got to keep it correctly that you know the the order of events and the things that polygamy was allowed back there to be a type to be to type Christ and the church all right but then we got up to that point of where that uh you know Christ and the church on the day of Pentecost sure it's one Christ one head with a many membered body yeah but remember it's only one body that's where you mess up see because there's no humanly way the mind can comprehend that that's I mean there's no way we can comprehend that that there's s billion people in the world today and that God could give every one of them the baptism of the Holy Ghost and yet that just be one body that just be one wife when there's male and female yes right and see then it it's something that has to be revealed he brought to the situation see of giving understanding to where we can follow and see and then come out of it and make a statement because I believe in that uh you you take somebody that won't tell you what they believe they don't believe nothing that true yes well I'm not going to tell what I believe why I mean is that one of them things that you and the Lord got it all figured out and you and the Lord's the only ones got it you might wind up like the little boy was that kept saying me and Grandpa we know something but we ain't going to tell nobody me and Grandpa know something we ain't going to tell nobody and he started crying he said I done for God now Grandpa's only one that knows so you know we're silly but do you follow it see God permitted polygamy not the original plan to make it because if you got him the original plan to make it then you'd have to have the original plan did he have to make the man sin is that you know does that that go through he would had to make you sin if he was going to go ahead and make it his perfect will to bring polygamy me he have to be the author of sin and he's he's not he permitted it to happen all right then permitting it to happen he could use it as a type right but one day see it has to come out to the Perfection and when it does it will still have something connected to it this is what I'm driving at but I'm not going to get into it this evening I know that I I'm trying to get you to look at something and think my Revelation for one time in your life without just saying brother Dell you said brother Dell you said brother Dell you said brother Brown said I like brother you just you just beating your head against a it'll be like an old we used to wake up on Sunday morning cuz we had an old tin roof on the house every Sunday morning you wake up it was a cotton picking old woodpecker but instead of getting on the wood he'd get on the 10 and he woke everybody up so that's what we're doing a lot of time we're just beating their head you know all right but now listen see the new birth we covered this morning the new birth cannot do away with your marital situations I don't care what you think you got to think sensibly the new birth does a way for the sin for the soul of mankind right all right and in doing that then the body is still left with things that we done wrong yeah but that you don't even preach Grace well I sure don't want to preach disgrace right I I hope the point got across this morning that's right that if you say that you all you need is the new birth then brother brandham didn't need to come the Bible was already full of Salvation right and he didn't have to preach the grace of marriage and divorce if all we need is a new birth Paul didn't have to preach it and what about Moses having to give it under when there was a lot of things that were legal right you see we go around and then we don't stick our head like a an ostrich into the ground and won't come up and admit but just remember the rest of your body is sticking out but because you're born again does not make all things right for the body well I don't understand you I don't understand you cuz how could you you you have us free but we're not free I didn't make the book right I didn't write the story I didn't do the plan you got to talk to somebody else all right because see if you're trying to make everything into the basis of just this does away with it well now look what you've done away with the rest of the things so we got to have a balance all the way through to come out to the basis of of having a complete understanding all right but I just don't understand how you can be born again and yet something hanging on to you remember the new birth is not in your body the new birth is not in your spirit I wish it was but is not all right but but I'm not responsible only just I I I I didn't do that just be sensible and think about it you didn't have mass confusion about now I'm going to say this and I hope it comes out right there wasn't as much mass confusion about marriage and divorce in the Baptist Church as they are in the people of this message no I would say Methodist Church I'd say Presbyterian I'd say they probably wouldn't as much in the Catholic as they are in the people of this so-called message because everybody's got it figured out and it's their way or no way well but listen you say well where's a Bible for anything connecting us to human beings in part go ahead brother and pull up uh 1 Corinthians I think that's right number five on your notes let's just read it let's see may I may have get the wrong one now yeah what know you not that which is joined to an Harlot is one body that's why you're not supposed to marry Harlot right because you become one flesh for two say he shall be one flesh but he do join to the Lord is one Spirit okay flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body why because sin originates in the uh inner being of you now to a lost person sin is from the total inside out Soul Spirit body is all sin all right now so you don't sin with your body you display sin with your body that's right you sin is the unbelief right right Eve was first unbelief then the natural right all right so look what it saying flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body why because it's the inward part now if it's a born again Christian and you don't like this but the prophets one that said the born again Christian did Sin so that you argue with him now all right and the scripture says the sins plural all right then if you're a born again Christian and you do wrong is that making okay I didn't do that for my soul I say you sure ain't connected to it because you can do the garbage cans but I can't do that the Bible says I cannot the Bible doesn't say you can't sin that's right it says the seed remaineth in you right the seed is what can't sin the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what can't sin amen right so the seed of God the AP ISM with the Holy Ghost remains in you and cannot sin but yet we have a body and a spirit to deal with come on you want me to quote your prophet he said hey even beyond the curtain of time he said them women held me and they said you don't understand what I mean if you don't believe it go find your quote that's what he he said you don't take a woman and pull her up to you oh that's free love it don't bother me you a lying hypocrite well look flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinth against his own body all right now if I'm not right and the Bible's not right why do you have to confess to your partner tacking a nail down okay why do you have to confess and brother Bram told that woman said you didn't sin against God right you sinned against your husband well wouldn't it be vice versa you know okay yeah but us guys you know it's all right for us to do now there ain't no such thing if you didn't follow me this morning you surely missed a whole lot right amen man can't put his wife away for just any cause he's got to have scriptural cause not just because you don't want to live together CUA they they do it no see you always got motives in behind those things you know you you've got some reason that you want it that way just won't admit it right but see our reasons come out in the last days because of who we are but see now remember we better get down to understanding to understand that you know the Bible says she cannot put her husband away for any cause but the Bible does not say he can put her away for any CA cause he's got to have a scriptural cause if not he commits adultery why because he's going to go get him another one she winds up committing adultery just because you say well we just wasn't compatible I told you start with you don't like my way of talking but you marry the first time because of Harmon factors that's called lust oh no it was love at first side yeah then it was love at second side and third side and fourth side right yeah you get me no hormone factors work upon people and causes them to get married I know you don't like I destroy I'm sorry I'm sorry about busting bubbles now I love it I like to see that go you I like to see your face go I said up here watching you you mean it goes and then all at on you go oh I hit that brother around said you ought to see the reactions on people's faces I'm not a prophet I just look at faces but now we we covered that she cannot put him away no matter what but he can put her away if he has a just cause scriptural just cause quoted by the Lord Jesus when he was telling you in Matthew 19 you know and then we had the other one in Matthew uh is it 135 or 53 31 or something where one of them says saving for for the cause of fornication the other one says except it be for the cause of fornication all right now before we start with the point of defining and you may think that I don't have these I didn't rewrite this was the service for this afternoon so let's go to Galatians 3 that we were on this morning all right you got Galatians 3 26 coming down talking about being baptized into Christ and he says there is neither Jew nor Greek there's neither Bond nor free there's neither male nor female for all for ye are all one in Christ all right that's the only way we can be Abraham's seed all but there's neither male nor female in the body of Christ amen that should be sensible there is no male and there is no female in the body of Christ it's the female which is the body of Christ that's right all right everybody clear with me all right see then if that be true then you can't lean on the fact of male being one way and female being another way in the Kingdom no that won't work right in the Kingdom they're the same right because that's the way it was supposed to have been right right it was supposed to been you know just to stay with the male and the female as being one that was the original all right see then you can't can't go and say well it's okay for him but ain't okay for her you got to have scriptural reasons right and having scriptural reasons you know you you must go to it and you'll argue all you want to about things but I I want to I just thought of one scripture that I did pull up go ahead brother and pull up Matthew 22 I want you to read this with me and let's think about it cuz this is the people talking to the Lord Jesus you got it all right I'll start reading down they come to him saying Master Moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother remember that was the law you know you had to take and raise up children that was put to the other name everybody clear now watch they're using it to trap him right now there were they see they give him a parable oh we're going to get him now there were with us seven Brethren and the first when he' married a wife deceased he died he died right and having no issue left his wife unto his brother likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh so you understand you remember this morning if her husband be dead she's free to marry in the Lord you remember all right so her first husband dies no children so what happens the brother takes her and supposed to buar Children the first child goes to the man's name right of the beginning the rest will go to his all right so you go through seven of them they thought they had it really going good last of all the woman dies died also therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all at her Jesus answered and said unto them you do Heir not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God now remember in the body of Christ is Nei a male nor female far in the resurrection verse 30 they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven now that's going to be a day and I'll bring this point out while I'm at it uh that's going to be a day ain't it when you get up there she comes up and starts through the Pearly Gates and she turns around and said hubby one hubby two hubby three hubby four hubby five hubby six come on now that's for her and he ain't got nothing to do with polygamy go she's not tied up none of that but what happens when you get up there were that the man has a wife and she dies and he marries again he has another wife and she dies has another wife and she dies and he has seven wives is it going to be going through the ply Gates come on hubby I mean wife you know you understand Jesus said you do error what we've been taught is the reason we think the way we think right see I know there's this discussion around here about it about a statement brother brandham seemingly made and I'm honest I wish I if you'll tell me where it's at I'll be glad to get it and read it I know there's something there in connection but I don't I can't find it with a computer that you know some people say well brother Brown said all will be made right over there we got the wrong partner here we have the right one there well now suppose he said it what how are we going to deal with it you didn't understand what I Illustrated in the resurrection right I know the stories I know the things I know the arms and mey taking him on one and hope taking him on the other I know the stories so brother Brandon is going to have two if that's the way you're going well what about the lady that married the husbands what are you going to do with her you see you're dealing in something that a man is expressing sometimes a thought and as he's expressing that thought we don't get the right understanding of that thought right now I ask you a question number two question for me to drive the nail what's the reason of contemplating U the situation of uh well I may got the wrong husband here but when I get over there I'll have the right one what's the reason when I just proved by two scriptures that there neither male or female what's the purpose I'll tell you the purpose people are wanting Soul mating have you ever heard of Soul mating Soul mating is where you know that I say well Peggy me and her can't get along so I'm going to divorce her and find my real soul to mate with me cuz we're going to be there as husband and wife now you can think that all you want to what's your reason well I just want to know the truth I just massively confused you is there any truth could be brought out of a quote that a prophet would say maybe I don't know he says it in the verbatim words you may have the wrong one here but you'll get the right one there or something or all things will be made right what is he meaning all things will be made right the ride I want when I get there is to be the Bride of Jesus Christ not to try to figure out how many more wise I got right but see we think we're going up to heaven and we going to get all these wi back are we going to get all these husbands back why what for I know what a man done one time a real dear friend of mine years ago he had a dream he had a dream that he had a seed to plant and that his wife was already through menopause so he knew that he couldn't have the seed through her so he went out and got him 18yar old girl planted of seed and got a child I L the man he was a wonderful old man I sit at my house and talked with him I said brother why did you mess up well my wife was already to menopause and she couldn't have the child I said don't you understand if you got a seed to plant that means you got a word to seow right you're a preacher you're an understood right not to go plant a natural seed into a woman and get her pregnant am why didn't you preach the gospel that's right and I told him because it was a seed doctor they were on I come here with a seed in me now I know that's prevalent even here some people still think on those things of a seed but just remember that seed went to a natural girl getting pregnant right cuz I told him before then I said you're setting on the Vil's traps and you're going around and around with that Seed doctrine and you're going to do wrong and he did but of course he's spiritual now do you think you could tell him he was wrong about getting that girl pregnant no way he was led of the Lord 80 70 year old man getting 18 year old girl pregnant oh he led of the Lord I'm too old I'm sorry I just have to look at it the way I see it that in the bases two wrongs never right in one just on your way I don't know where they're pulling this room or what they're pulling it up for but uh please let and they going have to give it to me well all born again believers I don't know what to do in MC so we'll we'll go on with the message okay they're trying to find something that's all right but now listen let's get down to this and be serious let's be a serious Point why are we concerned about heaven and what's going to be up there we better be concerned what's going on here now cuz there ain't no way of getting up there and correcting things right if there's any correction it's got to be done here here because we can't get dire and plead A Cause right so forget it you know just settle down and be what we are but the discussion has always been among the Believers of the message because I faced this 40 something years ago and I gave this quote that you know our doctrinal ideas in our mind so listen now everybody everybody awake we than fornication we've been taught fornication is before marriage and adultery is after marriage all right but now how are you going to put that together it's been taught that a man can put away his wife I know invisible Union I got to quote and marry again if his wife has committed fornication but it's been taught that if a man's wife commits adultery he can't divorce her and marry again so now you're really in good shape and you're going to be in real good shape when we find out that God put Israel away for adultery right and God put the methodus away for adultery and the Baptist and the thing for adultery but see then we need to erase that part whatever you would believe about adultery fornication you need to erase that old teaching because it was taught and I know a man that they told him he had to live with his wife and she had committed adultery and that he could not divorce her let alone even Remar now so what are you going to deal with fornication when all sin we just read in the scripture is without the body but fornication is of the body all right now we'll give you the definition in a minute the prophet said what is fornication he said it's unclean living but see I know we've been taught that see we've been taught that fornication is before marriage adultery is after marriage well that's that's sensible that's true that's a definition but you cannot put it in that category and nail it down without giving some understanding because you're going to have it that God could put you away for fornication but couldn't put you away for adultery and where you going to put the man you mean the man he marries a woman and when he marries a woman and she commits adultery is he got to live with her or can he just divorce her but he can't remarry which which way you're going come on I know the definition of fornication and adultery we're going to read what the prophets says but I'm trying to get you to think sensibly when they we're not supposed to think we're only supposed to take what the prophet said okay Judas went and hung himself you go do likewise help yourself you want quotes I can quote he said Luther denominated and died and went to hell you want to quote quotes will kill you now you know Luther didn't denominate and die and go to hell that's right right you know better than that right but see you just say well I've got a quote well all right but what about it but remember what I'm illustrating in the body it's neither male nor female in the resurrection it's not trying to pick out who's going to walk up and take whose arm I told you I love the story I believe it will happen I believe mey will take one arm and hope will take the other one I believe that but is that two wives would you have any trouble may I illustrate I mean I won't get everybody up here but may I illustrate it you got mey here brother brand here and hope here would you have any trouble for brother brandham to lock arms with brother Neville or mey to lock arms with brother Neville and I don't know brother Neville's wife's name that you know here she would come and here would be another come and here would be another come that's right I mean come on cuz it's not going to be going up there and having babies because I'll remind you of the man that I told you the story about because he's taught and you can see it in his mind that one day in glorified bodies you could have sex all day long and not get tired now I don't back up that was in his mind burning sorry for being plain but you got the point see then what is it now let's take the definitions go ahead with number three on this is paragraph 5758 excuse me uh paragraph 1 85 questions and answers 1959 8 or 628 should be number two on your said brother Bill what is the difference between fornication and adultery Matthew 199 Jesus said in Matthew 199 whosoever put away with his wife and marries another excepted be for fornica cause of fornication commits adultery the difference between fornication and adultery the word could be applied either way now that's his wording all right but to make it clear what he was talking about cuz that was the question what's the difference between adultery and fornication he said it couldn't be applied either way but to make it clear what he was talking about there a woman that's un married cannot commit adultery that's sensible we don't need that explain because she had no husband to commit adultery against it's uncleanness for her she has to confess that to her husband before they are married if she did that if not her husband finds it out later he has a right to put her away because she took a false V all right defining fornication as a woman before marriage in comparison with adultery as to accounting to her being married right we he says it can be applied either way well now let's see pull on up to the bottom I think and I like to put them all in I believe I marked that oh yeah I didn't mark it but so fornication is what a girl when she lives unclean that's fornication cuz she has no husband but when she's married and then she lives like that she commits adultery against her husband all right no problem we've got the definition from the prophet of understanding of what it's to be all right then where do we put it we're going to hold that to a point as I said to start with and we're going to say that a man can put away his wife for committing fornication in his own invisible Union where he says it's even 10 years which you know what that means it doesn't mean just 10 or 11 or whatever he just meaning no matter where down the line she tells her husband she was untrue to her him before they married then he can put her away he said and marry again why because it's she was on true to him false vow a lie all right but now what are you going to do with a man that has a wife and she runs out with somebody else are you going to make him live with her are you going to say that he can divorce her but he can't remarry now I want to see that in the scripture I want to see that in the prophet's message go I know that's an argument all but now where's your argument which is the greater the fornication before or the adultery after he put Israel away for adultery come on you see we get that bent into our brain and like I said no matter how many quotes I give you today you're going away with the same thought and you're going to keep that thought so then there's nothing to do but pray look what he saids on marriage and divorce now was Eve married to Adam now I know they were one flesh I know the whole situation okay but was she married to Adam did she commit fornication or adultery which one did she do you know where I'm heading because Adam had a god-given right to have put Eve away right there right now you agree with me you agree he had a god-given right to put her away brother R said she committed adultery well now that's taken away that she that you got to stay without adultery all right go ahead because that's on marriage and divorce I didn't get to Mark these because I I was late getting back up and all right let me pick it out where it's at uh roll it on up yeah they talking about it was not an apricot what it was neither one she committed adultery you talking about Eve right that brought forth the first child which was Cain Satan's own son for and him laid to Evil all right Eve committed adultery and Adam had a god-given right to put her away right there but we know he didn't but the prophet didn't say she committed fornication why because fornication adultery is the same word they had not come together as husband and wife right so then they are tangible fornication or adultery it's all the same word all right now look at the next one invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 229 how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage your adulterous parent Eve is it's no fault of your own by your natural nature you come after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you were born in adultery a sinner so what is it then so we're back to where that we use that scripture of 1 Corinthians 16:6 it says flee fornication for every sin that is man doeth is without the body but he that committeth forn ation sin against his own body you're back to fornication and adultery being the same word see a woman that commits if she does fornication all right that's before marriage we got that out straight but then she marries what is she is she a fornicator or an adulteress by not telling her husband husband cleans the nail which one is it now let's just get a few quotes and go ahead well number six why we're not a denomination how would you how would a king commit fornication for the church is spiritual fornication spiritual what is fornication it's well it's like a woman living untrue to her husband she's living with another man while she's got a husband did it click she's living with another man while she's got a husband so if she don't tell you about hubby number one right and she's married to you she's got two hubbies right now which one is it adultery or fornication now you got them both involved because she committed fornication but not telling you but now she's committing adultery by living with you right oh now interchange your word right okay right and this church then is pretending to be the bride of Christ while she committed fornication with the kings of the world with her unclean living unclean profession you know profession he said it's deep all right look at invisible Union paragraph 83 read 85 86 and look the same as a church married to the law has to come also before Christ before the second marriage she has to confess that if she doesn't and she lives with her husband 10 years and then confesses it he has a right to put her away and marry another woman that's the scripture fornication is unclean living okay we stay exactly with that believing it all right but now as I said are you going to bind the man to an untrue wife cuz if you do you got problems with with God cuz he put away Israel for committing adultery right right okay so he can put her away for committing adultery we got that straight he can put her away for committing adultery and if he's got legal grounds he can marry again that's why brother brandham is emphatically stating that we haven't got there yet he said that's why it doesn't say for him it says for her come on what about this woman what about this wife what about this one that you would live with for a while and then she commits adultery against you you know and you say what but you can't remarry you'd be surprised what doctrines is in this message I had to face a whole church one time in a ministers meeting up over a doctrine of one thing and they called his brother's name and I told him later that I defended him and they said he couldn't preach and I said well how come you know any problem you know is there any problem yep problem is cuz he ain't never been married listen you mean that's the reason you're saying he can't preach that he never been married right I said well Paul wasn't married oldest brother he lambasted me in the pull pit right in front of everybody Paul was married he was a member of the Sanhedrin court and he was married I said brother brandham said he wasn't I said one day I'll find it we didn't have the computers I found it I poked it in his nose and let him read it brother R said Paul said I got to right to marry but said I won't Jesus wasn't married that's what I mean see people Willet with their own ideas it don't make no difference what what even logical sense they'll stick with their own ideas and doing things look what happens about this lady let's read it let's read number nine first flashing red lights of his coming I said I I put these out last night so you can argue what you want to a man that's married to his wife there are not no longer two they're one and a man that'll run out after another the woman let's get both of them him and her he automatically separates himself from his wife if he runs out and a woman that runs out with another man now that means they're married right you understand hubby wife everybody with me she's dead to her husband see a lot of people don't need the grace of marriage and divorce to be set free from women that they're messed up with I can prove that in the Bible I've done been proving it to you if he's got a legal right to put her away hey I got the quotes on down I know the message brother Brandon say you can put your wife away for cutting her right but he said you can't remarry right I love them but he put her away and said honor of God to do so he says because she's unclean right just cutting your hair come on but look and a woman that runs out with another man she's dead to her husband she's denied her own flesh she's cut away from him that's right in the day of judgment we'll have to answer for it now you know what scripture he's using go back to number eight now 1 Timothy 5:6 but she that liveth in pleasure check the background and see what I'm talking about but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth all right she's dead while she's living if she lives in pleasure that's the scripture he's refering referring to so then you tell me don't come up to me and tell me and say well a man can't put his wife away for committing adultery can't remarry I say I don't agree with you you can put her away for fornication and I agree with you but I don't agree with the way it's used here come brother Dale again okay this brother married this woman and they had I think 10 kids we will use a number nine where it won't get involved nine 10 kids one day he decided he wanted to get him another soulmate he come up and used that she wasn't true to him before they married now if she didn't tell him he's right but if she told him he can't use it 20 years later uhuh don't talk to me I'm too old even if you're talking about the girl and the the vows and the thing the Bible says in the moment that it was heard that's right he can't come up 20 years later and said forgot about that you wouldn't true to me when we married she said yeah but honey I told you all about it you think they ain't done in this message there a dummy woman to put up with a junk like that I'd have probably shot him or I'd have took him down to court and I said hey he don't want to live with me no more he got nine kids put it on him make him pay a hundred bucks a piece every week for the rest of his life I know I just don't play if you understand cuz it's too silly to play she must confess that to her husband if not he can put her away right what about it you still have your adultery and fornication as divided words you still holding that he can for fornication but he can't for adultery look at the next one I don't have a number on it Brothers questions and answers paragraph 76 I had a hot one that hot one on that down the other day in street they were talking about women and should women wear long hire and I said a woman that bobbed her hire husband had a right and a Bible right to divorce her that's right that's what the Bible said that's exactly right oh my Holy Ghost women sitting there just the way they've been taught that's all see yes that's Loosely and he said now if you would cut it if there's something wrong they had to cut her hair they had to shave they had to do all the things he's coming down uh he says she cuts her hair she dishonors her husband and a woman that's dishonorable has a legal right to be put away in divorce but he can't marry again now he can put it while his wife for well why as I said about the guy that Liv with his wife and had 10 kids I mean why did he want to he found a younger wife right right he didn't find no 80 year old woman I'm too S I know I'm too hard but I'm straight you can't come up and say well what do you believe you know what I believe I believe in Liv living right and being right amen but I believe in being it according to the word and what he's saying here look at this one and then we'll get to well I got two more paragraph 144 marriage of the Lamb church has done the same committing spiritual fornication as a woman that would share her love from her husband to another man oh he calls that fornication spiritual part and he uses fornication and talks about sharing her love with her husband and another man do you understand what I'm getting at fornication is unclean living do you need those quotes unclean living right adultery is unclean living right either one of them the same thing am all right now watch you know uh that woman is not fit to be lived with you know that and when the church begins to share her fellowship with the world God is a jealous God he put Israel away because of that and his son will put the same thing same same thing away he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen she's holy Washed by the blood of his own self that's right and we see where we stand the wedding getting ready to come I have made this statement I was listening the other day in 1982 where I was preaching on the seals I made a statement then I'll make a statement now now anybody that has a marital situation I have always told you you got to go between you and God don't come to me cuz I have no fix I don't have no quick fix right I don't have no gray areas I don't have no things I've been accused of a lot of it but one of these days you'll understand why I do things the way I do on other things but but we'll get to that when I told you I've always told you you go to God you talk to him brother R said there's ways been made before in this you can't explain marriage and divorce how can you explain that Rahab the Harlot which was a prostitute a married an Israeli General that's right and out of there come the lineage to come down to Christ right you can't explain that you can't explain Ruth and Boaz you can't explain it there are certain things you just might as well just leave it alone right and ask God to work it out right that's it but I have made this statement I will rephrase it when it comes to the change of the body if we're not right in marriage and divorce we're not going de change change change I didn't say Rapture I had no intentions of that everybody that is Born Again dies and goes by the grave will come up in a Rapture right right if you have the real New Birth right all right but see these bodies are so connected to this earth until we've got to have the grace of marriage and divorce not disgrace amen and remember Grace is a revelation right Grace is not for the future right really Grace is not for even present tense Grace is for theast CHR right amen if we can believe there's Grace for a new birth why can't we believe there's Grace for marriage and divorce right amen now not to go on and do and do that and everybody's got it all figured out my old Uncle he was a Pentecostal preacher and he married and had some kids he divorced her and married another woman well you know they wouldn't let him preach you remember the old days they didn't do that and they told him the only way he could justify that was divorce the second wife and go back and marry the first wife and that's what he done and they let him preach you see my brother around said misinterpreted theology our ideas it's okie dokie because I think it it ain't oky doie because I think it is what he says that's right it's whether or not he's right all right but watch what he says on marriage and divorce and I'll end it paragraph 256 I want to end this part because this is Wednesday night we'll carry it on and we'll have questions and answers so you bring your questions I I love questions I don't mind saying I don't know Aaron Roberts he's probably listening in first time I talked to him on the phone he asked me a question I said I don't know he said wait just a minute now he said everybody tell me brother Dell knows everything I said well somebody told you wrong CU Brother D don't know everything yeah notice he can put her away but she cannot put him away watch he did it and proved it in the days when Luther Wesley in Pentecost now you're coming up to the spiritual right but remember your natural times the spiritual okay when they refuse to become the further part of him by having spiritual intercourse after a fire to become pregnated with the further part of the word you understand she refuse the Lutheran Church refused for Christ to have any more Desire with her Luther refused it and let me say this going to call me something anyhow so is it today that every one of them that failed to take that word they refuse Christ and any woman that refuses a man his child has a right to be put away right to be excuse me has no right to be a wife to him amen you remember in the Bible when the King married Esther because she wouldn't come out she refused to come out see same thing is it when a woman that refuses to be wife to her husband what did he put Luther away for you've read marriage and divorce he put Luther away not Luther right quotes kill you not Luther the Lutheran that denominated and died he put them away right he divorced them right and he married the methodus when they refused he divorced them and married to Pentecostals yeah right the Pentecostals refused it now it's left up to a little bitty bride in the end time to believe it and to really be his wife and stay in that order let me give you two scriptures Jeremiah 3:8 go ahead and pull it and I saw when they had caused whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery and I put her away so God put Israel away for committing adultery right you said but wait a minute he's coming back in the end time he doesn't marry her back his wife that's right you're out of your scriptures they come up as servants not wife he hadn't broke his scriptures cuz he tells you not to go back that is Deuteronomy 2 4 And1 if you want to read it he tells you flatly not to do that not to take a woman back after she's been put away read Revelations 2: 21-22 we'll quit and I gave her space to repent of her fornication I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation God can use fornication and adultery as an interchangeable word in his very scriptures see I believe we must use it to be able to understand see then when Luther refused the Lutheran refused to go on God put it away all right that's why now I've I've got to use a word that I don't understand but I do the best I can because it's all I can understand there are some parts about polygamy that I don't fully understand but I do understand one thing it is not legal to have more than one human body connection so what are you going to do if he doesn't have a legal right to put her away and he divorces her and marries another he's got two women now the world still sees that right right I mean come on you go down to the courthouse you got number one on record number two on record right they're still keeping up with it but in God he can set the records clean that's why brother R says he can but said she can't he said you got you double Covenant no matter where we're at under the New Testament I'm ending it this way I had to preach to get it back double Covenant does not talk of Salvation in the soul now come on I preached two hours to get that quote is in the message this morning I just didn't bring it see Church all things must be made right that's right yes sir here you can't put it in the wrong place you'll never come out in anything he can put us away brother R said anytime he wants to that's right but said how dare us try to put him away and try to make it we can't do it that's right cuz we are the bride amen so then there's where we stand stand on the basis of one thing his word is Right amen that's right he will stay with his word amen if he gave the man the right to do it he gave it to him right not because of the polygamy that was done away in Christ but because he's still typing are you with me he's still typing he t Christ in the church one man one woman he'll holds that all the way down through but just remember he's got a many membered body right we can't put him away but he can put us away for Spiritual fornication and he did the lutherans and married to Methodist now was he free and what he done that's what I ask a man up in ten see one time when we were discussing marriage and divorce he said I'll take the scripture and tear you apart I said I'm sure you can but you got a couple scriptures you got to face you know and that's where he went to Deuteronomy 24 and he said why one of his cords did he didn't do it he said why in Deuteronomy 24 said tells a man tells her that a woman could put her away husband marry again I said let's read that let's read it now Deuteronomy 24 can you pull it up brother when a man had taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes because he had found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out out of his house and when she has departed out of his house she may go and be another man's wife that's not a mistranslation that's a truth but it's a misstated truth not by God or Prophet it's misstated by our minds cuz we're read meeting that it's okay right she may go and be another man's why we're reading it with our mind what do you think you think it's okay she departed out of his house she may go and be another man's wife you know what brother Brown said he said she will marry yep that's right you said I now what are you going to do I'm going to keep reading scripture roll it on up now let's give a little illustration if the latter husband number two right first husband put her away some uncleanness right everybody with me right number two latter second guy and if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement she got two bills of divorcement and give it to her hand and sendeth her out of his house or if the let husband die which took her to be his wife if he died she's got one husband my fingers right on that you know I mean you know see if the latter husband die now can she go back to the first one we're going to read the scripture her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after that she is defiled for that is abomination before the Lord and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance if her second husband dies why can't her first husband take her back you're commanded not to take a woman back is that right you're commanded of God not to take a woman back when she commits adultery against you you do it on your own account you can hoodie do all you want to and say well I'm typ in Christ I'm going to love her no you just want her you see what I'm talking about the Bible answers his own self it cannot be saying that she may go be another man's wife and justifying it CU it was why can't her first husband take her back after the second husband died can't do it it you see we are in all of this because of misinterpreted Theology and that is the only scripture that I know of that can be related to Moses and his marriage and divorce but if you'll read that roll it back down and reread it found some uncleanness in her it was not for burning the bread or doing what they wanted to do or any cause it was some scriptural reason some uncleanness I don't want to get too far but I want to warn these girls because that does not mean the uncleanness in that woman I can prove it by the Bible it does not mean she had to have intercourse with a man that's right it means she simply let him handle her in the wrong way may I say it that way you young girls let no boys handle you wrong you boys remember don't go after the girls it don't have to go that doesn't have to refer to sexual intercourse Young's literal translation says nudity especially the pudenda girls don't let boys touch you you ask me out of church I'll tell you what that penda mean if you don't understand you're not an adult anyway I'll go ahead and say it pudenda means lips all he has to do is some boy handle a girl not these lips will be a dummy Pender external parts of a female are not to be fooled with by mankind girls remember that don't let a boy fundle as we call the word that's how strict God is and his word is true come on Brothers I hope you understand me I'm not trying to convince you of nothing I'm trying to preach the gospel but you see Church you say well I never did need to Grace of marriage and divorce I've been through right all my life what about spiritual was you ever in a Baptist Church did you ever have a Doctrine of a Baptist did you ever have a Pentecostal a presbyterian a delight or who eyes right you see misinterpreted theology Mis understanding and putting it that it's got to be our way has brought us to the place where we're at but you know what I serve a God that can make all things right that's why I've always said you know the people in the message they got these seed doctrines and they got if you was born from Adam and Eve you could be saved but if you was born from even to Beast you can't be saved I don't give a hoot who my daddy is because I found my daddy I found my daddy in Salvation not in the natural world I love my daddy love to see him sit right here but I love my spiritual daddy Mama's doctrines are fine she got on to my wife one day and said I just don't believe that old stuff about that serpent seed y'all talking about well she didn't remember how she used to tell us about daddy daddy told my mother he didn't know a brother random or nothing he told my mother what happened in the garden you know why he a 45 year- old man before he married he knew what it was and he told her what happened well she never said no more once my wife said well you better listen to what Mr Dale said because he did believe that serpent seed is not a new doctrine I've always said since I heard the prophet that those Pharisees knew exactly about the serpent seat cuz why would they say we wern't born of fornication right they believed it they knew what it was that uh Rabbi Richmond and whatever it was up there brother Bisal he said to think of sex being the original sin is no problem but said you brought up a new point when you say sex with the Beast he said that's something for us to think about you know cuz see they believed it if you don't believe in serpent seed and sex and problems I've always said it you can put your little kids a boy and a girl in the bathtub until they're about 2 years old but after then you better make them say in different bathtubs they begin to figure out that there's a little difference in each other so the safe way two different bathtubs right that way you don't have to worry about it no but my kid wouldn't do nothing is your kid born with a Halo my kids was born with a Halo my grandkids was born with a Halo my great grandkids was born with a Halo and they held up by horns right they're held up by horns because a human think about it fornication or adultery is an interchangeable word and he can put us away for fornication he can put us away for adultery go you better remember more scriptures you know you remember that says that till come in that day and say let us take your name to take away our reproach now what does that mean you remember they told Jesus you know talking about in the par let us take your name to take away our reproach it's a reproach or used to be used to be a reproach for an unwed mother to have you know unwed person have a baby that used to be it's not anymore but that used to be a reproach but there's no reproach for a woman that's got 10 kids even though she's got 10 different husbands right we'll get on a little bit Wednesday night cuz you see we believe in grace you know that if a woman marries a man and she's a virgin to start with she's still a virgin long as she's married to that man ain't got nothing messed up that's the Bible and you know what if her husband dies and she marries another one she's still a virgin you ain't going to like that one are you cuz you tell me it's not right you have a legal right to marry again see we going get all this Virgen we get it all figured out God's got it all figured out what we got let's 6 628 in the spiral
