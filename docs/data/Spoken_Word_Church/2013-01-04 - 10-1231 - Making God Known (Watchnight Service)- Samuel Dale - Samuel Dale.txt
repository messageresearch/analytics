Holy he's worthy in me holy holy holy I want to see amen and amen holy holy holy good to see everybody in the house of the Lord and good to see brother Collins his family back there with us pray that the Lord would bless them for their effort to come out youd like turn in your scripture turn back where we've been reading from Revelations 1 and then we'll go to Deuteronomy 29 Revelations 1 Deuteronomy 29 now remember the Bible study that we generally have on the first Saturday of each month for this month will have to be the second Saturday because uh tomorrow would be the first Saturday so we won't be doing that but just remember that the second Saturday and also remember this is the worship meeting uh time the third Saturday at brother longor so you know I pray that the Lord would bless and be with each one amen I turn Minister meeting to all right the ministers meeting for the ministers will be here on the second Saturday at 11:00 and so remember that amen we're kind of off balance some of you maybe need to move over here keep the church flitting over cuz everybody's on one side from so far back but amen I'm going to try to preach the rest of the year so that's that's the best thing to do I guess end of year by preaching amen Revelations 1 Deuteronomy 29 our heavenly father we thank you Lord for an opportunity of being here tonight with brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and we pray that you would just bless each one of us Lord and lead us and father just Lord as we try to speak about you we would ask that you would come on the scene and one word from you would be worth more than all of the words that we could put together and all the studying and all the things we could do but for you to just come and just speak one word to our hearts we love you and we thank you as we come to an end of a year we thank you for all the years that we've had cuz it's been a wonderful time and a experience Lord and going into this next Year we're looking forward to more about you but we're looking most of all forward to seeing you in a Rapture and getting out of this world and moving on we love you father and we just commit everything to you now in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 we've been using this scripture for quite a while and we just keep using it it says the Revelation verse one of Jesus Christ now notice it didn't say the revelation of Jesus it says it's the way it wanted to say it revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now unto who unto Jesus gave it unto Jesus Christ see to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now remember what we've done uh the past last service the time is at hand what the time when the revelation of Jesus Christ is to fully be made known the time is at hand the time to understand okay let's go back now to uh Deuteronomy I think I left out my my paper with all right Deuteronomy 29:29 says the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law you may be SE Ed the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have a lot of notes for you tonight and uh you know we want to just basically take our time cuz I announced that first time since 1971 we started here July the 4th this coming year on July the 4th will be uh you know the uh whatever the time service Falls will be uh 40 years that we've been here in the service so we just uh you know we want to continue on but we've always had a watch Night Service I don't ever remember of calling off one even for weather conditions we've had a lot of things but and but I've never preached one I always had somebody else but I wanted to try to express to you something that I see or you know I believe I see it and you may doubt it all right but and those hearing it may not agree with it but that's all right cuz I'm just myself and I I just always try to tell you what I believe I don't have any secret things you know the as we read during the scripture the secret things belong unto God but now that scripture lets me know one thing for certain there are some things that we will not know in this world about God now that's the key to the whole thing thing tonight is to see that they can be something after we leave this world and then that will take away a lot of things that people you know are tied up on and I know that there's a lot of doctrines about the godhead uh we're in a time now where that many things are going forth that you know uh there's people that believe that Jesus wouldn't God to the River Jordan that's their business I don't have any problems I just don't agree with it cuz my Bible said he was born Lord the Christ but you know that's to me is the thing I want you to see tonight I want you to see that we had a word Prophet now do you know what the word Prophet means it means a man who has no understanding of his own he yields himself to almighty God abely and he speaks to us and it is God speaking to us through a man now I believe that the man's not God but he's speaking to us and doing it now I'll repeat this again in a minute but I want you to think about it the prophet of God said every Prophet must line up his message with the prophet previous to him all right right you know every one of now not necessarily that this guy may be writing away over here and this and over here but just understand the point your Prophet is making he's making it that the word must line up from Genesis to Revelation all right now you're going to see a wonderful key in a little while though that will help us because you know Moses had no one to read from see all right he had no one to read from he didn't have a book that he could read about he didn't have a prophet he could line up with he had to get his message straight from God all right but see in the end time then we believe this messenger must get his message from all that's lined up prior to him and he can't add one word because if he adds one word to the Bible the curses upon him just as much as it is anyone else you know now I know brother brandom made human errors in speech yes I know that we all do we're in the message because that shows that he was a human it shows he was a mortal person he wasn't almighty God now people say now Jesus made mistakes well I different we there and I want to see it in the Bible but that's my point I I have to see anything I've got to see it in the Bible you say well brother Brown said so and so well all right it may take me 20 years to study on it before I find where the Bible says it that's right but I've never found anything the prophet ever said that the Bible didn't say all right now 40 something years I've been studying it and I've never found it cuz you say well there's mistakes here there's this well you go ahead and do what you want to you'll find out one of these days who you're following right because you can't be following God and claiming to be a a messenger you know and all of the things that people say about him and all but that's all right that's up to them that's not me and you I'm not preaching to the world if anybody out there wants to hear it welcome to it but I'm not Pastor in the world I refuse to accept any responsibility for anybody outside of this little group of people all right cuz that's who I'm responsible for all right but now watch that in a little while as we begin to deal into the message now here's one thing I want you to think about the only way that we can get across what we're talking about is by words right I me it doesn't matter where you speak in Spanish English Chinese Japanese whatever you know it's it's still words right all right it may not sound like it to some of us but you know what they say is still words you know but see by looking then at even like a the Bible that we would find things that seem to be contrary right from this statement here to this statement over here you know it may sound contrary it may be uh you know sound totally off as I always like to say to you about it what about the Apostle Paul now no one in the Bible no Prophet or nothing never believed in nothing but one true and living God true but what about the Apostle Paul said the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ bless you all he had about six s you count them up but we know that's not right cuz there's only one true and living God but there's many manifestations of that God all right now that's what we want to deal with but we want to deal with things like what brother brandham would say brother brandham will say a lot of things things and there's a lot of people in Mass confusion because they find where he says this here and they find where he says this here and and they don't try to wait for God to put it together like I said I've studied on things for 20 30 this this message I'm on now on on one God for tonight I've been studying this over 40 something years amen because I saw many many years ago that people wouldn't seeing it and you remember about about 30 years ago I asked you the question I said when I say son of God what do you think of well everybody went back to 2,000 years ago on the shores of Galilee but see I said but that's even your theologians even your Scholars even your your writers knew better than that they they know that the first thing that come out from God was the word right which was the son of God then I said you're trying to figure it out and you're you're dealing with a human flesh you're not talking about what I'm talking about now tonight I keep making this statement when I I know how to say Jesus when I want to say Jesus talking about the flesh all right but when I'm saying Jesus Christ all this I am not necessarily referring to the flesh if I do I will tell you I'm referring to the flesh see but Jesus Christ is almighty God and we know the body that we call Jesus it had a beginning all right and it had to be made Eternal not that it was sinful or done anything wrong but it actually had to be redeemed there on the River Jordan where the prophet of God said this is my part of the earth that I've redeemed from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it right see he placed it in order but it takes the Holy Ghost to be able to understand cuz the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word brother brandham can't reveal anything to you that's where people go wrong see they say brother brandham had the Revelation I got the Revelation well that's all right if it's revealed to you but Jesus brother brandom said Jesus said my own life did not reveal that unto thee the father is the only revealer of the word brother Dale and Bo nobody I don't care who they can't reveal anything to you we can only talk long enough to where that you can get the Revelation from God all right see then watch in a minute when we get to to what brother Ram is saying and it'll sound it sounds so odd until you say well there's no human way that can be you know but we'll see where it works out or Not Right But now remember the last message we preached we were talking about and we gave you a lot of quotes and I've got them laying here in front of me if you want them of where brother brandham says and tells you what the Bible is he said the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ now watch my point he didn't say that the revelation of God right CU God is an object of worship right he didn't say it was a revelation of Jesus you may find quotes like that but get the point of what I'm saying the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ all right so then let's don't start Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago let's go back see to where the prophet of God would bring it unto us and study it from what he's saying and then God can show it unto us see now number one on your notes look what your Prophet has to say about it Christ revealed excuse me who is this m ches the main point I want you to get is you read all this on all the whole quote and the people on internet have got the ability to pull it down and read it but look what he says notice this is in the beginning but before the Eternal that's right now do anybody want to explain that right that's not being sarcastic I'm just saying it right I'm saying it's only the prophet could say it that way see only Paul could say the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ right and it not have reference to some form of trinitarianism you know or something so the prophet of God he says what in the beginning but before the Eternal so you see immediately that we're going to have to go way back into time and they uh bring the the board on up here and we'll just put it up I wasn't going to use it to right at the lights but we'll we'll put it up and and then maybe I can refer to things is everybody cool enough I turned the A on feels better it feels better I'm sure but turn the fan on is it running okay now cuz we don't want you to get uncomfortable and we don't want you to go to sleep I see you getting too bad of sleep y day okay let's stand up and holler high high high you know we'll do something that's a I don't want you to turn cart wheels but I want the wheels in the head turning okay so just bring it over here where the video camera to make sure and pick it up and uh then you'll see some of the things that we're going to do all right now while they're doing that I want you to think about the point we must use words that's right to describe what we're talking about right all right that's the only way we can communicate with one another I can't stand up here and say all right now brother Anderson I'm going to send you a message you get it now he didn't get it cuz I couldn't send it but you see by words by words I can send him a message now not on the telephone don't try I get him on my phone and I try keep trying to tell y'all don't send me them messages on my telephone cuz I don't know how to get back to you on it and if I did it take me a week to type it out so don't do it call me leave a message I'll get back with you but now listen we now we must depend upon the fact that we believe that brother brandham was a prophet right all right and then by believing that he was a prophet we believe that he was capable of doing what we cannot do which is we'll get to it a minute about going back in the back part of God's mind but yet he could do that and and then bring it down into words and then it would take many years why do you think we've been around here 40 something years since the prophet left is because that we have not got the Revelation exactly the way he was trying to preach it to us I mean that don't need interpreting does it we we I'm talking about me you all of us but you see a prophet of God seeing a self-existing Eternal God that would he would say and I gave you the quotes there where he says he covers all space fills all time runs into eternity now how can you explain that a God that covers all he he covers all space fills all time and runs in and it runs into eternity yes he's trying to get us to see the Eternal God all right now in doing that he was using words words that we can take and we can misinterpret we can mistranslate you know get our own thoughts and wind up in a mess or we can wait on the Holy Spirit to reveal it and see you know I'm just as honest as I can be because that's the way I am I wish you'd be that way with all of us but I wait until God reveals something to me that's why I haven't had to back up and retract a whole bunch of doctrinal issues that I brought out that wasn't right now of course when you say it that way people think you're being sarcastic or arrogant or think you know everything or whatever ever but uh I don't have to worry about it cuz it's the truth you can think what you want to about me but see I haven't got tied up in all these doctrines because when a Doctrine comes out I study it right I check into it but then I let the Holy Spirit show me whether it's right or not because there's never been a Doctrine yet that's not had some word basis to it at least some quotes some idea some thoughts you know or something but yet still now what so the prophet of God now is trying to explain to us how this great Eternal one could cover all space all time eternities and yet he's got to put it down into words yes that's right and by putting it into words you automatically seal something up now I get into my heart what God has revealed to me and I come here to the church and I try my best to explain to you what's in my heart that God has revealed to me yet I realize if that same God don't speak to you right then you're not going to see what I'm talking about right you'll know what I say intellectually you'll know that it is in the message you know like because you know I read so many quotes it's at least got to be somewhere in there but still by using words I must use words to explain now here's what most people here's where you going you going to get a bad one from people see I have to use words to explain what brother Brown is saying right now of course you know what people think about that it don't need to be explained Just Believe It Like It Is Well the Bible says that Judas went and hung himself and another scripture says you go do likewise see I think it does need to be understood your Prophet said I break it down in big nuggets and leave it for these ministers and all to break it down to the Ley right all right that's all I've ever tried to do I get the greatest honor in the world to stand there one day and just present one person to Christ that would be the greatest thing I could think of in just one person what about a church now but you see he's trying to explain an eternal God and putting it in words which automatically limits the ability of human mankind to comprehend because I I know how the human mind works you know I mean some of you sitting there already thinking well how long's he going to preach some are saying I we e sh up let's go get to singing cuz I want to sing you know hey come on I don't mind talking like that we just all human if I sitting there you know what be doing I probably having some him thoughts you CU see I'm honest I at least tell you cuz I see I know what the human mind does that's right brother yes God trying to reveal something to you what happens All Things Fall Apart don't they kids come running in babies come in and screaming phones are ringing everybody's a holler and and the Lord's trying to speak to you like I told you there the other night there the other day about it you know that walking around through Walmart right in the middle of of torment and walking around Walmart and God speaking to me and telling me to call Lisa and tell her that congratulations about the the baby that Matthew and them expected but you see you just got to wait and let him do what he's doing all right but now listen what about trying to explain a God that your prophet would say like number four on your notes that this eternal God dwelt Alone with his thoughts now if the human language means anything you know English whatever language you're in to say that God dwelt alone all right you know what that means do you know what that means that means God dwelt alone simple that means there was nobody there there was not anything with him now you read down through all these give you I'm going just try to hurry it up but you know and just quote the little Parts off of it and you'll find a prophet of God saying that was before there was any hour before there was any molecules before there was anything brother and he dwelt alone who the great self-existing Elohim and you know that Elohim is a word they used to try to explain God it is not a Bible word you know you don't find it written in the Bible do you you might find it in the original translation where it would come up to Elohim but you know but we don't think about what it is or either we go over too far and we think about him as dwelling alone and then there is some I'll get to it here in a few minutes but we think about him as being dwelling alone and we just making nothing you said no I'm making God but we better remember that God is an object of worship so you got to bring him down lower to where you can understand that can you comprehend an eternal almighty self-existing God that dwelt [Music] alone well that's the best way can do brother we just put him by S you know we we set up something and we say There It Is Well what was it it was God no you you word god means object of worship all right we see which well it was just a spirit we'll get that in a minute where the Prophet said he was a being amen now but what do we think about it see do we just making nothing I tell you what I believe I believe that Eternal God dwelt alone but I believe he was in a place and a position that was so much greater than what you and I are in until this is just a little thing little play parties on Earth I believe God is real well he's just a spirit see that's what we've been taught by mankind all the way down and you know God is a spirit but some of you fellas that used to drink you would see a pink elephant cuz you was drunk and it was more real than anything around you and you'd run into somebody getting away from the Pink Elephant yeah cuz it was real to you is your God real or what is he well he's just a spirit then what are you amen right I thought we were M In His Image but we get on down to those things God dwelt Alone with his thoughts the next one that's on uh who do you say this is the next one is does God change his mind about his word he said he dwelt alone but in him was attributes right right in him was attributes well I thought that the prophet said and it's in here somewhere that we were his attributes right well was we back there not like this no right not in human flesh now no don't get to that because he wasn't there in human flesh but it was so much higher than what this is until that's my point if you'll get what I'm talking about I believe God is real he's not just a that there is a Doctrine by denominational churches that says that God is just the the good thoughts you have and that Satan is just the bad thoughts you have you know and then one of them is a good spirit and the other one is a bad Spirit but you know your Prophet said Satan was real yes sir now if you look you'll find he said Satan is even a being that's how much real he is so we we're not going to get into him but see but look what is it mean self-existing what does self-existing mean to the human language you exist by yourself he said well you don't have to be so carnal with us tonight brother Dale but I'm not being carnal I'm just being true we say we we we take words to express what we're talking about and you know what we do then when somebody can't figure out what we're talking about it said you just can't understand it I agree with you reason I ask you a question I don't understand it but see that's what we do we use excuses well self-existing like I've always said I I don't understand it but I've always said it and I'm sorry to be carnal but you know they people can preachers don't even believe in what happened in the garden but yet Playboy magazine will show you what happened yeah brother down you mean you look at them yeah and you have too so don't Crow you might sneak around a little bit well ain't nobody looking I was going to preach on the pyramids one time that work I told you about I was going to preach on the pyramids of Egypt and this boy up there at work real good friend of mine Beck and uh he he he was a real good buddy and uh I told him what I was going to preach on he said well I got a Playboy magazine got that in it an article on it well man here I am sitting in a little office cubicle and the guy comes along looks over in there we CAU the preacher he's reading the Playboy magazine man that guy took him and wonder hurt him he grabbed him I'm talking about just bluy back he grabbed that boy and he shoved him against the wall and he bounced him off and he said I brought that preacher that Playboy magazine cuz he got an article in it about what he's going to preach on and Bud nobody didn't say nothing about the preacher with the Playboy magazine no more he said Well why'd you read it because there was a lot of good article in it I didn't have to go to the centerfold that's right come on it's just where I'm honest and straight but now listen self-existing one means he existed by himself there was nobody with him no people was with him no little identities running around in him like uh the Mormons believed that we were all up there with the father before the world and and then they we come down to earth to glorify our father and and that's why the two Soul people doing the same thing the message and all these little dots running around and that's right would you see if he was self-existing you know what that means that means that there was a time whatever you want to think about how wonderful you are there was a time you didn't exist right you can only exist in the thoughts of God right that's right but you know while you existed in the thoughts of God judas's carot existed in the thoughts of God all right see then self-existing this simply means he exists by himself and we can't be self-existent there's nothing in the world can be self-existing going down to to the Mighty God unveiled and you read down see in the beginning before the Eternal he was self-existing he was Elohim alone when you see the word Eternal and try to express what you see when you use the word Eternal right and you're trying to express that's what you see you see it of someone say God you know as being Eternal see then the word that you use come on folks just be plain language with me for a while all right this is the way I like to preach I like just be plain and that way you can't say that I'm trying to pull something over on you and I'm trying to tell you like it is we can thank God for it then then you know when you say Eternal brother dick you're making it something right you agree that's right yeah but now come on you still making it something when you say Eternal you're making it something you're making it the Eternal God yes cuz there only one Eternal God right but you still made it something no no no I didn't make it nothing I just said what it was you're not listening to what I'm saying when you say Eternal you're making it something what you're making it Eternal right and that's the only word you can use cuz you wasn't backu to have any other word to use it with we try to express eternity as like having no beginning and having no ending right now you just made it something right you said what's this important if we don't see how the Bible's written we can't understand what happened before the world come on I'm trying to lay down something okay that's right when you say Eternal and you say that's the Living God you just made him something what you just made him Eternal now accept that when you say self-existing you just made him self-existing because you're denying all other things of existence that's right and settling it down to where it is self existing existing [Music] alone when you say it's like a ring meaning it has no starting point right and no ending point but you've made it something you by your words made it something are you understanding me yes when you say Eternal you made it something AB when you say no beginning and no ending you made it something now don't back off that after a while when I get down to what I'm saying yes yes cuz you backpedaling now that wasn't what I meant well don't backpedal just stay with me when we say that he dwelt alone that means now what other word can you use it means there was a time cuz that's all we know to use time Etc a position a place or something that dwelt alone God dwelt alone all right quit trying to make us back up there then make us in his thoughts and make us attributes and things like that that's fine but don't make us people but at the same time now don't make him as a non-existent something that you can't put a l on now you know what I mean by that you put a label on eternity you put a label on no beginning and no ending you put a label on a circle going all the way around and have no beginning on it but then are you going to let your God go clean out of existence cuz just remember whether you like to think it or not we had to come from God you everybody in the world had to we know the story even the word God is not used because the word God in Genesis 1 where it says God created the Heaven and the Earth the word God could not be there as that form of that word until he created something to worship him that's right and that was the Angels now the quotes are in it's okay the Angels worshiped him and that made him God you know where that was at in eternity he created angels in eternity now I didn't say see there's your words I didn't say he created Eternal angels I didn't say that cuz that won't work cuz there something them Angels fail and they won't be Eternal so you see words trap you but what else can you use see by by saying that God is eternal we make a beginning no no no we don't make it come on now you you ain't getting it you're saying that there was a time or a position or something that we never existed whatsoever in that God dwelt totally alone that's right but as I said and I don't think about him as a glob floating around through the heavens wondering what's going on well I don't know what I'm on to do I just I'm just a spirit and I'm just that world there is more real than anything we've ever thought of eternal life you have in your soul is just a touch of that eternity that is D where did your God come from ohk God you know where the Bible tells you he come from he come from teon didn't he that's what the Bible says that's right you ever notice your Bible said God come from teon right you know what teon means right hand yes he he is right hand that's why it says ton see we come up to Genesis 1 and in Genesis 1 we use the word God right now you got to listen see that word was translated from the word Elohim cuz your Prophet said it now in Genesis 1 it was Elohim am and he even puts it over where you get into John 1 uh the unveiling of God or Mighty God unveil one of the two I think is unveiling of God he said in the beginning was Elohim and Elohim was with Elohim and Elohim was Elohim and Elohim verse 14 says was made flesh that's he's trying to show you one true and living God that word was translated down from Elohim and it wasn't used in our English language of Elohim because the Angels had already worshiped him bringing him into the order of God but the word God in Genesis 1 is Elohim that's right you better hang on because 126 and 27 you better not run around with a trinity come on we're not over there that's right but before Genesis 1:1 there is no way or anything that you and I can be able to comprehend God that's why we got to depend upon the prophet amen right and his ability to go before God and God to speak to him because there is no writing before Genesis 1:1 no matter what you can take the theologians and what they're doing is just translating those words that's right they're translating those words that are written down that's right there is nothing no way to comprehend anything before Genesis 1:1 without the prophet of God to be able to bring us the message so our total dependence upon him all right [Music] now but we can look at the creation in Genesis 1 and we can begin to see the Creator right now in Genesis 1 the creation of all things you know the Earth the moon the stars etc etc if if you'll take that and read it sometimes and really get in the spirit of God you'll see that Genesis 1 is God trying to explain himself to man cuz it winds up showing you that he finally created Something In His Image he made the animals he made the trees he made the Stars he made this he done made Angels he' done all this he done the angels and everything like that was created in eternity yes but the world in Genesis 1 there was no now listen listen and you see over here the creation time not counted you what what it was it was seven days no time hadn't begun at that time he said what kind of a state was it in well let me quote brother brandham he said Adam in the garden was his youth was being renewed right so that's what I said we got a prophet to go with if we just get away from our ideas see Genesis 1 is a creation but God didn't start keeping up with time until the fall came even though there is the days but how long is that day oh now we got to profit in't we say oh that just 24 hours now according to the Bible a thousand years is a day and a day is a th000 years in God so that could have been 7,000 years get the point what I'm saying time wouldn't be uncredited there was no need of keeping up with it you think you're going to have a calendar in eternity and you going to be like you're in jail you know have to do in jail you know they mark off the days that day done and that day is done and that day is done you no you think in eternity we're going to have a [Music] calendar but yet there will be days and nights right but I thought we believed everything would finally want it to be Eternal so using words but listen God cannot change his way now I wrote myself a little note here stick on there where explain before you can understand an eternal Elohim you're going to have to get into the Bible you're going to have to get in the written part right am if not what are you going to put it on how you going to prove it's right that's right how do you going to know it's right your idea is good as mine mine's good as yours so that's what I'm saying let's come down to Genesis 1 and let's look at Genesis 1 let's see how the Bible was written you remember W did the other night the other Wednesday night he was covering Genesis 1 and Revelations 1 you remember [Music] that to those that wouldn't hear will Express a little bit about it if God ever does anything one time he must always do it the same we talk about healing saving Etc but remember if he wrote his Bible one time he ever wrote one book anywhere he's got to write every one of the books in our sign right now how was that written well just prophet got where did Moses get the ability to write five books and to tell us what happened in the garden and the creation right a you just sat down one day and thought about it well you sure got a poor imagination about God in his ways but you see that's what I've been trying to get you to see reason reason we've been reading in Revelations 1 because Revelations 1 shows you or to me it does to me anyway shows me exactly how the Bible is written then I can go back to Genesis and start in Genesis 1 by the way of the Prophet right and see how it is written then I'll see who he is right all right so what is it in Revelations 1 what do you see the revelation of Jesus Christ Christ which God gave unto him boy you're trinitarian that's two Gods no we showed it there in the last message that Jesus didn't even know his part in the Kingdom right they asked him about it when was he coming he didn't know your Prophet said page about 14 in there the church age book right in there he said it hadn't been made known but but I thought he was God well let's solve that problem do you have the new birth am okay do you know everything what's the problem right it Ain been revealed to me thank you even brother random said there was times that Jesus Remember he'd say according to your faith be it unto you that's right he said because the father had not reveal to him that they were healed but said when Lazarus come said he'd already seen a vision and he said I do nothing until the father shows me and he went kept on going instead of coming back until finally he came and raised him that's right the words don't get lost in words let words be the ability to understand Genesis or Revelations 1 we see the revelation God gave to Jesus to give to John John was the writer the angel was the one who transmitted it down to John to be able to tell him right now so how did God write Genesis one we're in Genesis 1 where it says God created the heavens and the Earth can you see that's the sign because now you're going to have to listen to the words now listen to the words and I'll Express them later but listen to the words okay Revelations 1 it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him Genesis one says the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave unto him right amen amen he don't say that will you tell me why I don't say that you see that's where we're getting tied up at that's right we're not looking at God in the way he done things you know that God the Father we'll call him out a way where we won't be using the word God for object of worship you know the father never created a thing according to the Bible according to John 1's Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 James 3 and9 is that what it is Jesus Christ created all things that's why when Peter stood there and Jesus said who do Man say I the son of man am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God go over the Book of Luke I believe is the other one where it says Thou Art the Christ of God is what Peter was saying you're the Creator now then we're coming down to a son wow but the father never created anything okay so in Genesis 1 you see the Revelation that God wanted to reveal himself to man amen you agree with that amen you agree with Genesis 1 being God wantan to reveal himself to man okay so wouldn't that be the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John amen hang on a minute we're going a little further right because in Genesis in Revelations 1 Let's well let's swap it this way Genesis 1 says the revelation of what God gave to Jesus Christ to make known right well does the scripture say sent and signified by his son come on are we in the Bible revelations 1 says a revelation that God give to Jesus Christ to make that known like Wade was bringing out Genesis 1 God made a spiritual man 126 and 27 which was Christ you agree mhm how about in Revelations 1 where God showed that spiritual man standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man G about the PS with a golden girdle which is femin he showed him that spiritual man you see what I'm saying just follow with me a little bit and then it'll click see the spiritual Man was created in Genesis 1 that's right the spiritual man was revealed or shown in Revelations 1 Genesis 2 God made a natural Man Out of the Dust of the earth and put the spiritual man in the natural man you agree that's right Revelations 2 shows you that we start the church Ages were that the Genesis one man was put into Genesis 2 now it's the spiritual man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost put into to the bride of Christ down through seven Church ages now you see what timeing together it'll all line up now if you watch it so we're not true there we got a lot more to go Genesis 3 you see that 3 and 15 says I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman Revelations three tells you in 3:14 who that beginning of the creation of God is which is the Lord Jesus Christ The Promised one that was promised to be the seed of the woman so it's lining up we can look at the Book of Revelations and see how Genesis was written right okay in Genesis 1 you see the Creator the word Elohim your Prophet says in Genesis 1 was the creator it was the logos it was the word it was the son of God it was the theophany that's Genesis 1 Genesis Revelations 1 shows you that God in his bride amen standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick now I've got it written like this all right come on told you it's going to be a long time we do it pretty good we're 9:30 I will try to explain more in a moment of why I said that in Genesis 1 it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that was given to right right am I'll explain that better in just a moment but listen now in Revelation 1 God gave the Revelation unto Jesus Christ about himself something about himself that he didn't previously know you see yeah but he was God brother Dale amen let me ask you a simple question and I know immediately the answer if I say Do you believe God knows everything you'll say yes he does well he don't know about them sins that I just repented of you agree it's wonderful when you know what you're talking about you got to see him as being able to forget you say God can't well you explain it then because if you don't believe it that way you still got your sins you don't know how they're gone I told you one of these days want to preach on God with amnesia cuz he forgets everything I do as long as I repent and I loved it so much when I heard that that what brother Brenham said about it he said if a person comes before me and he said if they've repented of their sins he said I cannot that's right go back in their life and bring up that that they've repented of that's how great God is I love him Church you think I'm playing or showing trying to show how smart I am 40 something years so we see in Revelations 1 that God gave the Revelation that Jesus Christ to give to John John was the one that was to write it down the angel didn't write it the angel was the one to deliver watch that Genesis 1 then we see in Genesis one that God gave the Revelation to his son Jesus Christ to give unto mankind you say a son that's a trinitarian that we don't believe in Eternal sunship okay Elohim he done something to bring it and do it so you want me to say it this way or which way you want me to bring it in Revelations 1 excuse me Genesis one he sent and signified it by his Angel to give to the prophet Moses amen amen you say you catching on am who wrote Genesis who wrote Genesis how did Moses know what happened in Genesis he sent and signified his Angel gave it to his Prophet Moses to write it down that's Exodus 3 amen and there's some quotes we're fixing to get to that's the burning bush experience Exodus 3 remember it was an angel that came to Moses at the burning bush you agree am and that angel was almighty God wouldn't it amen God spoke to Moses from The Burning Bush you agree [Music] amen see you had to have an angel to deliver it by right now are you with me look at number 11 on your notes who was that in the burning bush expectation 1951 and I know and any scholar knows that that angel was the angel of the Covenant was that right which was Christ that's true it met Moses in the burning bush it was the pillar of fire not Moses done the work now then so Revelations 1 is right it's a revelation that God gave to Jesus to give to John he gave it to his son to give it to John at the burning bush God speaks to Moses the angel of the the Covenant amen and who's he here's the angel of the Covenant right right am which is Christ amen okay for some reason I left off number 12 at the title of what it was but it may be a continuation of expectation I'm not no it's not a continuation but may be the same book we don't worry about we don't need that one but brother R said it was the angel of the Covenant plenty more of them let's see how Moses wrote the Bible number 13 on your notes we would see Jesus gra Valley California in 1962 704 Moses wrote five books of the Old Testament Exodus and Genesis and Exodus Leviticus Deuteronomy numbers he wrote the five books of the Old Testament ire by inspiration from God he wrote and told what it was then he wrote and told what would be who from that angel of the Covenant if you need any more on that about the angel of the Covenant call me there's plenty more I just just run in your computer Angel of the Covenant see I've got stacks on my desk and I just what am I going to do with them told way the other day I said I've cut out two hours on one thing you already know by now that's about truth but he got it by inspiration am see Moses didn't have anything to read from right the only possibility Moses had of any reading would have been the the book of of uh who is it job job because it was written for Genesis but I'm just trying to get a point to you God spoke to Moses through an angel at the burning bush told him to go to Egypt and take over that same Angel guided him he said my angel will go before you but said you better be careful cuz my name is in him read it in Exodus there he said my name is in him read Exodus 3 cuz that was the Lord Jesus Christ now you understand I didn't say Jesus I've got enough sense I said the Lord Jesus Christ the angel of the Covenant the Loos the theophany the word that created all things communion 19651 1212 do show you just as Moses went into the Wilderness to receive the inspiration to write the five books the first five books of the Bible Paul went to the desert Etc and you know where he went now to just show you how tricky words can be there is two quotes that brother brandham says that Moses only wrote four books I don't mind saying that well that's contradiction cuz one of you wrote four and another wrote five no and ain't no misunderstanding is it he wrote four what's the problem with thinking he wrot five that's my brother he's a messages preacher he said how could Moses tell about his own death over in in Deuteronomy you know and I said if you'll explain one thing to me you tell me how Moses know what happened in the garden right and we won't have no problems right with knowing how he could write about his own death right that's no trouble I just say that just where people see people what they do with you they they call me a smart elic because of the statements and the way I make and then I'll come up and say he didn't catch out I found where he said he just four books well he did he wrote four books he wrote five books no problem all right Christ being the angel of the Covenant the logos the theophany the word that's who comes to Moses if you want a better understanding of it I'll get it in memory in a minute but maybe somebody else can help me is I think it's unveiling of God but brother brand was talking about the Ten Commandments and he said when the seals came he calls the Ten Commandments the seals abely amen now I can take the seal just by my own understanding of what the prophet has said that where I can go and I can go back through Genesis and show you every bit of it marriage and divorce and everything right into those seals cuz your Prophet said one seal tie the endre Bible together that's not bragging that's fact I'm trying to get you to see something to where that I can say what I want to say Moses wrote the first five books by inspiration because he had no one to read from so we had personal contact with almighty God at the burning bush oh so wonderful how long could we preach Moses turns around and he says Lord I've seen you face to face the Bible says that and it ain't it's still in the same chapter or either the next one one he turns around and he said Lord I want to see you he said you can't see me something Lord I'd love to see you done seen him face to face talk to him lip to ear mouth to mouth as your Prophet would say and he turns around he says go stick your head in that Cliff of the rock what was the Cliff of the rock where he brought the water out the rock which was Christ go turn into Christ tonight and you'll see what I'm talking about Turn Your Head to Christ and get out of your own ideas pray for a revelation you will see Christ and see what he's doing brother R said outside of the Corporal body there's no difference in what it is thank he because he's here but listen then it gets confusing because a prophet would make these statements and he'd say Moses at the Burning Bush was speaking to the lost the Son of God number 15 on your notes look at it Moses speaking the angel of God that went before Moses which we know that the angel that led Moses was the angel of the Covenant which was Christ the son of God and the are the logos that went out of God was the son of God that's right he said well you just keep saying Son of God well I'll take it off right now now but I won't speak much on it there's only one true and living God a Son of God is God in another form called a son right not another person that's where people miss it say all right I want to hold that look at the next one number 16 the logos that went out of God was the son of God it was the only visible form that this Spirit had and it was a theophany which means a body and and the body was like a man Moses saw it passed Moses saw it when it passed through by The Rock right going down him and the theophany which was a Son of God that son that Loos became flesh because we were put in flesh and the theophany the Loos became flesh here among us and it was nothing else but the dwelling place for that Eternal fountain dwelt in him oh do you see it that was one are you catching on then truly it is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not a revelation of Jesus by himself not a revelation to just say well the Revelation just about God you know that Jesus never come to reveal [Music] himself anybody that thinks they're a Son of God a preacher or whoever it is and they think you're trying to reveal yourself to the people you got a garbage can you better wake up cuz Jesus was not trying to reveal himself read your Bible Matthew 11 25- 27 it says the son revealing he to whom the son will revealing Jesus Christ brother around said did not come to reveal himself or make himself known he said he come to reveal the father that's what I was talking about there the other night it's past Wednesday night see we take adoption and we saw oh adoption is is the father leaving and the son coming up boy look at us well look what we are we we're something we're the Sons and Daughters of God no adoption is when the son goes off the scene and the father comes on cuz I thought we supposed to take on his nature right yes sir you say well brother Dale you you you don't believe in manifested sons of God that's where you're mixed up in your cranium cap CU I believe in more than you ever thought about in your life because I've been preaching it for 40 years the word manifest is to make known right so you think it's signs and wonders and healings and things you can't do that let's see you do it now that's that's just plain you can't do it I can't do it Jesus couldn't do it he couldn't heal nobody right oh I just see that you you know go ahead he said I do nothing till the father shows me that's right the father is the Healer the son is just the deliverer right but you say well I thought you said it was a revelation of Jesus Christ it is the revelation of Jesus Christ is a revelation of almighty God he to whom the son will reveal Jesus didn't come to reveal himself he come to to reveal his father it's my father the one I'm talking about because why manifest what is it Romans 8 the days of the manifestation of the sons of God everybody thinks that's we got to go out in empty hospitals we got to go out and we got to do all these things no we got to make him known folks that's all I've done for 40 years is tried to make God known and for 40 years he's made me known enough that I don't have to worry about it amen I don't argue with nobody I've seen him manifest himself I've seen him raise the dead what do I worry manifest is to make known let's make God known he'll make us known that's the key make him known Jesus J made his father known and he come in behind him and made him known hallu this is my beloved Son in whom I police to dwell in read Luke 10 and 21 through 24 along with that about the who the son will reveal that's right see it's not the making known of the sons of God but it's the sons of God that want to make their father known brother brand wouldn't try to make himself known he was trying to make Jesus Christ known and what happened Jesus Christ made him known keep this in mind now what I've taught to you for 40 years an adoption that we see the father is coming on the scene by the nature if is the nature being in Steed into the son and we would lift up then the father amen you remember the signant don't come from the son the signant comes from the father see most people teach that adoption is the son being revealed no it's not the true Revelation is making known of the son the Sons and Daughters of God making God known which is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's right we make him known by preaching the word and he'll make his children known then by signs and wonders you don't have to worry about right now let's get down to something and think about it see the Bible is the complete Revelation then of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is almighty God all right everybody with me we're doing good but we're at 10:00 near 10 I'm not make it yet all right see it's not the revealing of Jesus the man right but the revealing of Jesus Christ who is almighty God now I'll bring this on to completion in a minute over here you see church this is the way I believe and I'm just tell you what I believe okay I believe there's only one true and living God that's right yeah I don't believe in Eternal sunship what about you your Prophet didn't believe in Eternal sunship the Bible don't believe in Eternal sunship but if Moses could go by inspiration and go back in there and bring out the things he did why have you got trouble with brother brandham when he says it this way is in Christ The Mystery of God revealed let's go back into the back part of God's mind you never heard a theologian talk like that have you go back into the back part of God's mind and see it's three-fold Revelation and see that that three-fold Revelation has to be written down right cuz remember we're not back to where Moses started it to where God could reveal it and he'd write it down we're here where it's all got to match what he said if the New Testament don't match the Old Testament then you you done missed it somewhere if this message of the hour doesn't match the whole Bible we missed the entire thing H see how it was written God gave the Revelation to Jesus Christ let me say it another word God gave his Revelation to his son amen right our God became the son God became the son the great Eternal Elohim became all of this logos word Son of God the with another God God in another form there's a quote in here somewhere you'll find it in your notes we don't believe in Eternal sunship but you know what we believe in you know what your Prophet said he believed in Eternal godship amen yes that's right right that's in one of your notes we'll find it in a minute it don't to in your notes he said I believe in Eternal godship why because God has condescended how could you understand him as we started off with a great Eternal one so I've been taking like the Bible to show you how it's written to show you how that the prophet would know see the prophet would know what happened everywhere why because he would enter the mind of God and as Moses would enter the mind of God and go backward now listen and write all that had happened this Prophet goes into the mind of God and goes forward now his farward can't match up because uh eternity's like a circle so whatever Moses started with has got to end with because it's got to tie back to Moses and make the circle all right are you with me so now if Moses has got one God and we got three where is it going to match back up we got a problem hooking together to Circle yeah right what if we got the same God the Son of God is the Lord Jesus Christ the angel of the Covenant come on let's see if I can get over here in a hurry the bride is part of the mystery page 74 Christ The Mystery of God revealed other than not your notes but she's part of the mystery must be revealed right that's why she's in the Book of Revelations but now watch this this a minute and then I'll I'll try to bring it to a close and then we can you can have questions and answers whatever you want to do first we see Elohim who dwelt alone Elohim back here in eternity all alone he had his thoughts he had his attributes in him but he was still alone now listen to what your Prophet had to say he said it's hard to explain it's on there in Hebrews cuz I'm off my notes now it's in Hebrews he said it's hard to explain but said he's a part of God part of God and he said he's all the God he say it's hard to explain now we got the English word SW ago that you was following with me and I said now don't backpedal okay you remember made a statement don't backpedal okay see brother random said and the quotes are in here and if I get to them I'll catch them and read them that Jesus was a fullness of the godhead bodily yeah but he said to logos the theophany the word that went out was a part of God now what does part mean I I love banana pudding but if you hand me some that you've already ate out of it's not all mine I only get a part the logos the theophany the word was a part of God because it was God in another form called a son right we don't believe in Eternal sunship and you know there is a time if I get time to get to it there is a time to where that the sunship will be surrendered that's in the Bible that God may be all in all will he go out of existence don't be carnal no attribute that God has ever had will ever be done away with it may not be in the use form and when we get into eternity of needing a Healer no and he won't me a savior no but it won't do be done away with that's right amen we'll still know him as that brother Brandon said we'd go up on the mountain with him and say papa God if you had come when God was Elohim the self-existing one the place he was existing in would have to be more real than where we are now or what kind of a god do you think you have when he just floating around he was just floating around waiting on something to happen floating around in white space wasn't there what your Prophet said come on he said there was no space there was no molecule there was no hour there was not a thing but you know what I like about it God is a being he's not like the wind he has a place where he dwells at and that's called Heaven oh I've heard people try to explain that you know to where they said well now what it is God's living in here now so you agree and I said yeah I agree well then the devil's in here and God's in here arguing it out I said boy you got to mix up CU my Bible says God won't dwell in an unclean vessel now well where's it at cuz ain't no Heaven who do R away with it you know that God's up there right now talking to the devil and he's trying his best that's what the Bible says and he's trying his best to make you sleeping make you this make you tired make you worried he doing everything he can and trying to get God to help him that's you see God is a being he's a person yes sir listen now I'm quoting it's down through there on the pages on your notes when he the Holy Ghost is come he is a personal pronoun ain't much of an English major but I I know a little bit about that he is a person the Holy Ghost is a person yes no the Holy Ghost is just a spirit where'd you get that from cuz it said when the Holy Ghost has gone he's a person he's a being all right that's number 19 on your notes what who is this Mel Chic he's a being he's not like the wind you'll also find it and it wasn't so from the beginning 1960 you'll find him say it on uh the position in Christ 1960 see we want to say he's a spirit but the Bible and the prophet says he's a being he's a person read all those quotes on down below there he's the Holy Ghost he is a personal pronoun that's go wait Jesus 1963 brother around said that when the beginning started we all can tell about the story of it and asked about it but if you'd read these two or three messages or listen to them or something get questions and answers on Genesis and that's 1953 72 9 uh get the message attitude and who is God 1950 8:15 uh get that one the message life which is preached in 1957 um all of them it's wrote down on those notes in front of you you got you know how about taking those books and reading them how about getting those messages and reading them and see what your Prophet said he said there we are going back before the world he said back before there was even a beginning of anything when he was eternal and said out of the Eternal came the word said that's the Loos or Son of God came the word a part of God brother I thought Jesus was all God he he was he's all of God we'll get to that in a second Loos word theop Son of God time didn't start until the fall so that's when he started keeping up with it you know but now listen the logos is a part of God right God gave birth number 29 questions and answers on Genesis God gave himself birth to His Son part of God Amen part of God inspiration and impersonations of Christ 57 12 uh 120 yet it was all God part of God what's your Prophet say now he definitely knows the difference between all and part wouldn't you think so yes what's he saying why would he call the logos the theophany the Creator and all why would he call that part of God now in a minute I exppress what I've seen for 40 years but hold on if a part of God means what it says then there must be more of God right that sensible come on is that sensible if the logos the Creator and all like that the Son of God was part of God that means it must be more of God Amen but to keep the story straight it wasn't another God that went out in the beginning that's right it was God who came out in the beginning and took upon himself the form of the word the theophany the logos and can't you just see old Satan Angels created now way before we talking about in Genesis can't you just see old Satan and how upset he gets because he' always thought he was the anointed cherub that's what scripture called him and he always thought that he was God's right-hand man and that's when he got messed up that's what happened to some people around here they thought they was brother Dale's right-and man and they come find out it don't work that way time runs out I'll turn this over to somebody else but ain't nobody in my rightand man my right-and man is the Lord Jesus Christ I don't have a right-and man you can't be my right hand land don't try cuz you can't walk where I walk cuz I can't walk where you walk but listen he was a part of God but he was all of God Amen right now we're going to get to why he called him aart because see people say I know brother randam got the quotes so all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ into the church and they make your beautiful drawings and people shout Glory Hallelujah of how wonderful it looks and not realizing what they're saying in no way in the world am I going to ever take him out of Eternity Elohim who do you pray to right amen see and if you realize who the Lord Jesus Christ is amen you can pray to him that's right now they're saying in the message now don't pray to Jesus because he was just a man I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ which is almighty God you ever notice your Prophet will say I told you Wednesday you ever notice your Prophet will say it like this he say father I thank you that you sent your son to Die For Me Right looks exactly like he's talking about two people but he's not amen cuz you see the Eternal God changed his form to become the word the Loos God in another form called a son we don't believe in Eternal sunship so then you can't place and make Jesus Eternal there's no such thing as an eternal son listen their sons and daughters that are Eternal and Jesus was a Son of God which was eternal amen that's but you don't have eternal sunship it won't work so all God was he poured into Christ but you ain't going to see me race that out at all amen I'm going to leave it just the way I had way to draw it cuz it's not a beautiful Revelation to see all God was he poured into Christ you don't realize you've left a vacuum you've left a hole a space or something you've left a a part that God cannot exist in Jesus prayed to his father right oh what it was he just praying inside himself no was he praying inside of himself when he screamed out on the cross my God my God why has Thou forsaken me he said that was this the flesh yes the flesh was screaming out but the Eternal God was still there see that's where man's missed it those that believe Jesus was not god Till The River Jordan they take that anointing off of him in the garden brother ROM talks about it leaving him but they make him to where he's just a man and he goes to Calvary and dies as a man brother R said no man can die for you he said it was almighty God that died my God can't die well I'd like to talk to you about mine cuz he gave his life up see that's where people don't believe God like I believe him I believe in body the prophet said he was a man but in Soul and Spirit he was almighty God so when he hung on the tree that almighty God that was inside of there just left the body right let R off right that's one God one God the see is he really wants to reveal himself so then when you say oh God what you say well you going to cor R ROM because there's a lot of quote probably about 26 I think where he said all God was he ped into Christ and I think there's eight that said all God was he poured into Jesus which is no problem with me just to show you that it's there show you how much I do try to study it out he did say Jesus cuz I thought now he never used the word Jesus he used Christ and then I thought I better check it and I run it in there was eight quotes and he said oh was he poured into Jesus what it was just poured in him there he wasn't all of God when he was born as a baby even your Prophet don't do it he don't cover him all of God until the River Jordan cuz he couldn't be he was God but he couldn't be your savior 12 years old he couldn't display those things until he come to the point of the world that it he became who he's supposed to be you said now what are you saying then see this is the way I see God like I said if you say all God was I'm going to cover this up to where just to show up that way you say all God was I can't cover the whole thing but you get the point they'll get it on the thing all God was he poured into Christ you just left an empty thing there who do you pray to well I pray to Christ wait just a minute because the same Prophet said all Christ was poured into the church now do you pray to the church where's Catholicism got you tied up at you don't realize you're right in the Trap Of The Devil I'm trying to tell people that it ain't going to change them no you say well brother Dale then what are you trying to say now this little line right here represents eternity I don't believe all of God crossed that line into time but Brother D all God was well let's take that statement let's take the English words oh God was where would that be at all God was would put a space on it or a time or an element and if you poured it all into Christ you're going to do away with God you're a Oneness and don't realize what you're doing that's right cuz they can make beautiful statements about it but that don't help me cuz you see I got to preach what's from my heart but brother Dale I thought all God came over here into this word where'd you get the idea where did you get that idea when the prophet of God said let's see if I can find listen to what your Prophet had to say page 211 Church age book number 33 on your not now then there is also the thought of this future partaking of the Hidden Mana I think it will be the Eternal partaking of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Eternal ages is to come amen how else could we begin to know the unsearchable riches of his own being all that we have longed to know all our unanswered questions all that will be revealed will be from Christ who is our life that we received oh sometimes we think we get to know a little of him and his word down here in it is so good it makes us rejoice but one day when our flesh changes that word and he will become what we had never dreamed possible Right amen 242 of the church a book it is the morning star that is visible when the light of the sun commences to shine when our son Jesus comes there will be no further need of Messengers he will bring us his message of cheer himself and as he rules his kingdom and we live in his presence the light of the word will become brighter and brighter in our perfect day see church I to think and I've told you over and over and over and over I believe we're only getting enough here to be able to go to heaven am to realize what's taking place that's all I've ever we're trying to tell you now if he's going to give us a message of cheer after this world then there something about God that's not revealed to you and I while we're here yeah but around say oh God was all me all now you said we don't talk like that that's what they say but now we just showed where the Prophet is talking about something after this world do you mean what what we're getting here is all we're going to get when we get to heaven we're going to set up there and look at each other and say well was a great time while we had down there wouldn't it no this is just the the playgrounds to get ready down through the endless eternities God will be giving us his message of cheer about him remember the other night brother Gary when I said there attributes about God that ain't been displayed you say well what are they don't ask me where do we get there I got enough to go from here but you understand what I'm saying now this is what I believe now this is what I believe you you you do leave him there but let enough of God come over into here to be the word the logos the theophany of the things and let it come on over into to you and I right and then let us go back go back one of these days let's see if I can find it cuz the scripture I'm talking about is in Corinthians okay excuse me I'll have to find it it's back in my notes it's in Corinthians where that God may be all and all let me see if I can find it's in Corinthians I'm sure 15 1 Corinthians 15 1 Corinthians 15:26 while you're getting there but I eny that shall be destroyed his death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him now that him there's Jesus Christ right okay then shall the son him son also himself be subject unto him the father that put all things under him that God may be all in all right it's on the back of one of you your notes blank sheep you got back Christ is the mystery of God revealed look where brother R places this and God at that day the kingdom be given over to the father he might be all in all listen while he's yet speaking I'll hear days of Christ David sitting on the throne the king over the whole human race where's that happen where's David sit on the throne millennial reain okay in the millennial Reign you'll see him as all in all you'll be the only what sees him right that's right the world can't see him that's right the world still won't know who he is they'll think he's God yes but they'll just say okay but the bride will know in the Millennium that he is all in all you know why cuz he'll be in all okay you see where the Prophet placed it Millennial Reign okay now jump up future home 1964 802 sitting with the throne in the top Now where's that at Revelations 21:23 and they need no light for the lamb and the Lord is a light thereof the Lord God is the pillar of fire that followed the children of Israel through the Wilderness and he is ascended upon the throne in that perfect Kingdom when time the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the father that God might be all in all Jesus sets upon his throne here as our Joseph so you know he's not doing away with him but what's happening that's right son will not go out of existence no amen but we don't believe in eternal sunship right we believe in Eternal godship but not Eternal sunship one more time to make you make sure you don't misunderstand me whether you believe it or not that's up to you I can't do nothing I believe the Eternal self-existing Elohim that was only a part of him come over amen and there was something about him that was not brought over into the revelation yeah one of these days when we finish this journey through the word that the offy and all and this over here won't be the fall no more but when we do we'll see him as he is cu the scripture says we'll be like him I cut out a whole bunch and now so just forgive me cuz that's already 20 after 10 listen listen church you can make a lot of drawings you can make a lot of words it takes a God to reveal his word you say I don't know what in the word you was talking about I'm simply talking about one thing the day you receive the new birth you only receive God as a baby form which can be called a part of God you grow up the stature of a perfect man we come out to the place that the prophet talked about adoption and then we get a change one day and all of this carnality be gone you see all of God wasn't brought down to mankind or else it would not be a message of cheer else there would not be anything left for us to talk about any [Music] ET I love him and that's who cuz that's the way I see that he's revealed himself to you and me by way of the Prophet messenger and no greater honor could be given unto that Prophet than to be able to introduce us to Jesus Christ if time passes off everything's gone I just want to make him known to you and my God hasn't ended because I didn't erase him out when I said all God was he poured into Christ I don't believe your Prophet did because your Prophet was the one that said they would be a message after we're through but it was all that you and I can comprehend all that came on this side of Eternity to be revealed to mankind was revealed through Jesus Christ that's right that's why Genesis and Revelation has the same identical beginning the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John back in eternity Before Time Ever begun existence whatsoever God had a plan and a purpose and as he did he unfolded that by coming himself not sending a son he didn't send somebody else don't get that in your mind of what brother Dale would be saying he came himself but now we'll go back to why we read Deuteronomy 29:29 because it says the secret things belong unto God right but those things that are revealed belong unto his children thank God for what he's revealed to us thank God for the revelation of his word because you might not understand why I spent so much time talking about the writing of the Bible because the writing of the Bible is one thing for certain your Prophet had to have something for it to come from if Moses went into the mind of God and wrote the five books and told you what happened in the garden I ain't got no problem with brother Brown I'm going into eternity and coming back out from the very back part of God's mind to tell me all about it but remember one thing he had to line all of that up with what Moses had to say he couldn't change it you take these Eternal sunship and stuff it won't match you take the river Jordans the soul two soul the doctr like it won't match up because you got to leave things out that brother randam said bring one thing to me that I've left out tonight and let's see let's let the Holy Ghost cuz he's the only one that can reveal the word I can't do it I wish I could I I do anything in the world I could to reveal it to you but you see I met God a long time time ago and he told me what to bring and that was to stay with his word I fought it out with a lot of men over the time had a lot of problems but you know none of them has been no problem to me because I've tried to get people to see God the god I see and like brother randam said about it he said don't don't you throw off on them legalist he said they'll be there that's what he said so how could we throw off on anybody else when I say A doctorine or idea or something I don't agree with I'm just warning you not to get caught with it because it's almighty God is leading all of us but if what I said doesn't fit then all right just come and tell me about it let me know but it's like I've always told you please come to me and let me know don't go to everybody else and tell them come to me and tell me you don't agree then you can go anywhere you want to and talk to anybody you want to talk about me and tell them how wrong I am but you owe it to me first but see people won't do that they'll go away and they'll say well I'm not going to hinder no whatsoever but then as quick as they get away they start doing everything they can to hinder and cut off and cut your throat and everything else but you see go ahead I love God and I love you any questions 10:30 anybody any questions comments thoughts whatever hang on a minute we have to get a have to cut me off here and we have to get way sister Trudy McMillan when brother when brother brand was taking to the other fars It Go come get come get you the battery may be running out on Mountain so we have to check it we want this on tap because that way we're at we have it when brother Brian was taken beyond the curtain of time he said he wanted to see Jesus and they said he couldn't cuz he was up higher is that the place where Elohim has always been and will we ever see that place yeah I would agree that that's where Elohim is he's higher and uh I believe we're going to see that place when we go there am I don't believe we're going to you know go there ourselves now and see it uh brother brandham he couldn't even go there he you know you remember this the story that when he beyond the curtain of time that that he he wanted to see Jesus he said he's hired but said you can't go there the but one of these days we're going higher but by revelation we better get to be able to see Jesus cuz I like what Paul said he said I might not see all things but I see Jesus I want to see Jesus that's what I want to see Jesus Christ but that's another dimension that's a travel so we'd have to go and brother random couldn't go so there's no needing us worried about it we just go on what we're doing here cuz I'm looking forward to getting dark I am I'm looking forward to get to heaven it won't be no carnality then I can look at brother Thomas Brother Anderson going to get the wrong name I can look at Brother Anderson like I said a while ago and I can transmit to it there but I can't do it now is that what you're talking about who'll be next brother Joe yeah we've been working in visions dreams and dimensions and uh he was talking about brother was in the sixth Dimension and God is in the seventh Dimension that's why they told him he couldn't go I know yet I guess mhm right go that's another dimension going brother brother [Music] dick the thought the thought come to me and saying what you said to me what sister Trudy said see Jesus was in another dimension he had an Earthly body mhm see brother bandam didn't have Earthly body at that time right so when we take on our Earthly body and go in then we'll go into the same Dimension here that's my thought now and this right here uh what you read a while ago the tharan church age it said when it talk about the Morning Star I think he's telling you or telling me that uh what makes the morning star light up is the sun true and I believe that's taking place right now right well you want to put this on the other side but I can see it happening right now and what you're ministering and and things that are coming to you I believe that there's an understanding that's going to come from that I don't see it all uh the other day what what brother uh way preached you know and they were talking calling that uh let us make man in our image he was calling that bride the question come to me if that was a bride where did the body of Judas come from the body of Judas come from the natural creation that was Genesis 2 but he he had a he had a a spirit and a soul mhm true see all right see and so when you get down to where uh man was uh formed of the Dust of the earth and a humorous thought come to me I won't tell you what it was told some people but anyhow a long long time ago uh I found out that the reason why uh Adam fell because he wasn't all there when Eve come to him because because Eve was a portion of him and they were separated you see what I mean this is me talking yeah see and I believe it has something to do with us getting back in the condition that uh like this right here uh where you say creation L God word and what have you if that's all creation had a beginning in end everybody El us got to have a change because that fa this over here didn't fall and I you know I'm not being trying to be smart I a lot of people I hear people say things and I you know I ain't trying to be smart or what I want to know see because I have I think I have things happen to me in this secular world that I know that it's a father yes that's leading me to do things and to say things yeah you know and and like you were you were talking about when you talk about when it's come to me well look who I am and I make the statement when it comes to me that I could go out and sit down on a white line in the middle of the road and hang my feet off of exactly that's how big it makes me feel right you know and I believe that's what it's all about but all of one day all of this will be made known amen but I believe that there's got to be a portion of this made known to change our bodies and and I say this in in what Paul wrote there he says without us they cannot be made perfect exactly and when they cut Paul's head off he left us and became one of them mhm and when brother brandom died he left us exactly and became one of them right so this thing is Left To Us amen like with the brother from Africa that got killed you know used to preach without us s j us s j s without us he is not complet right and there's a group of people that will be walking this Earth they'll never die amen I saw that in the Presbyterian Church before I ever knew who brother Brown was right and like I said that don't make me feel like something big up up or what Happ because you always was what you going to be exactly yep so when you you know the other night when you talking about that that that thing that was created there in our image you were calling that bride and I saw what you were talking about tonight in reference with Revelations one yeah but the question is where did Judas and Hitler and musini and Stalin where did all these bodies and souls come from right because when he made man he made man yeah now that's me mhm but see the the point is that when God created Adam he didn't create you and me he created man he created Adam see all right now that would just been him coming the man and Adam wasn't Eternal the body his soul and his soul was eternal right because that would have been the the Lost of theophany the 126 put over into two two there were you know let us make man and then that was put over in Genesis 2 into flesh so that made a human flesh that was not Eternal right and made a soul it was and a spirit with a perfect creation because else could you explain it and see he knew his youth was being renewed daily but his body was not Eternal and see that was the catch that's why he could fall is because when the part was taken from him of being Eve you know taken out and made Eve all right see then she was put into she was a body spirit and a soul right and that way I believe that wrote around saying her and Adam had the same theophany Soul see she had eternal life in her soul but she didn't have eternal life in her body and spirit you see people will say then they'll say well well if you got if they got eternal life how could they fall why do we do wrong I mean come on why do we do wrong CU we got a body and spirit that's not Eternal right we got a soul that's Eternal by the new birth so we can do wrong see Adam would had the ability to do wrong because he was a human element but see then the others had not come into being and uh now I'm not going to say that uh cuz you know I'm saying this is getting close to what people think uh I'm not going to say that uh Judas and all of them come from the Beast and all these other come from from the right lineage cuz that could be what you could think of to make a good story out of but it won't work because once you get over to the floods you cut the whole thing off and you got you know I listened uh yesterday the prophet talking about it and that's why they think the black people see was because of a curse that was put on Cain he said well if that was so said then that would do away with the that the flood would be done away with cuz only uh you know the sons of Noah come across right but see then you know you you can't you can't say that this is because of that you know the the Fallen condition brought the black man made him black cuz that's what they teach but that he said that's not true he said that would have ended right there so he had such a way of expressing things you know but I want to ask you a question about it and let's see how much you can think about the Bible why was it that Adam didn't kill Cain he was supposed to why didn't not kill him he killed his son
