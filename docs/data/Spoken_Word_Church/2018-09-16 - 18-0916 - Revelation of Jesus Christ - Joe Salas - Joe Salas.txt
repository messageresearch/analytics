overthrow their seat also among the nation and to scare them in the land thus they provoke him to anger with inventions and the play breaking open men and there was content on to a handful what - that's not - all generations forever more because they provoked his spirit so they spit are not that much with his lips destroy the nation but will mingle among the heathen and learn their works yeah they sacrifice their son their daughter meant to do [Music] thus were they defiled with it only works in the mouth more under their own invention therefore was arrived to the Lord and said Lord is honored there and they gave to the hand many times did you deliver them but they provoked him with their counselor and were broke below before their iniquity and he remember from them his covenant or appendant according to the multitude perfect Mercy's name save us O Lord our God and gather us from among that even to give thanks unto the Holy Name after the triumph and I pray together lasting to everlasting and that all the people say Amen no matter what Israel done oh it's going to do today it's just still not God's chosen people so it doesn't matter what they do hey read this today from the Israel and church brother ever said now when they left Moltres dying they started off to work the promise man at the very not close we haven't got too much time but they started towards the promised land who came who came in their way but one day there was an old king but awfully excited but the bunch of Hebrew was coming through there through there and they know that God was with them so he went over and got a prophet to come in person by the name of baden-baden got prophet by the name of Balaam and baylin's straddled a little on you after he ate John talking not to go and you know he started through the writings mean with a couple of service he was born over to curse Israel sure I'll go take care of them bunch of holy rollers for you I'll fix them up so he got on him you know wait he went right down through there you know the mule that more spiritual sight than the creature because right Emile's so the holy ghost Bennett in the road with Sauron you run out into the field master old creatures for him for him really what you need today is more mule writing don't you believe that that's right yes there he come here on out in the field he saw the angel aura standing in the way so the next time he the holy both went over and there were little narrow strip mistook there again and the first thing you know began to spur the own view and tried to get him through and then you just lay right down he started kicking him and beating him at a stick and then you turn on a spoken and union boss and say heaven I served you well all this all this thing and the provost still was so mad never even noticed what the mule was saying oh my if God can use a tongue of the mute to talk surely you can use a woman they'll surrender himself to God Allen and now then the first thing he scaled up top the creatures eyes and look over there and he saw that was a man up there stood the Holy Ghost or the angel Lord in the way he went on down and he thought that surely he was going to curse those people so when he goes down with pieman a picture in Jude just turn over or turn over listen when he got down there he said I watched Balaam and beta is going to Chauvet non-integral so he goes and builds his altars he was a prophet velen would know he just showed me a part of Israel just the worst part and that's just exactly the way to build us today you showed you the worst part of the thing that's what they will show some of these modern preachers for yelling I'm sorry but you just do the you say if not I'll carry John Doerr they used to live over here you run awfully strong sold Wyatt go ahead enough of that bunch of over rose he didn't think about not - or - citizen did the same thing that's right but they can cover it up but listen he's showed him to just being just so much as Israel they took him back and showed him so much there but when it come to a place and Balaam he thought surely had done wrong they did they do wrong they've done everything in God's calendar wrong nearly but what and Balaam thought that a holy God will surely curse the people that have done that much wrong he thought sure surely God would do it so when he got done and he was so many crazy until he could see what the reason that God was that God wasn't cursing them and then each time you tried to curse them you would bless them you tell all this prophecy like that and instead that person it would be a blessing to fall back to them ratchet obey or what I tend to call Israel how great that was instead of course enough it was a blessing what Bailey tailed to see who'd want that modern preachers and modern people failed to see the holy ghost ship today you see I know a lot of em call them selves is that and the other a lot of things they don't admit that brothers they say they blow up this and they've done that down there that's true I'll admit that they done wrong but we're bailing failed to see that that bracelet serpent the spittin rock go on before Israel to making that old man the God's calling because unless they will cause people call them and separate them with a certainty for them as an atonement and a spitting Rock and Balaam able to see that and then they the modern preachers fail to see the power of the Holy Ghost to spin you subscribe they we were in his body by one spirit are we all baptized into one body and our members of the party and the message the common start brother Brent said he said don't worry the fig tree is putting forth his buddy that's the last sign that sign oldest flag in the world plays over Jerusalem she's a nation of her own mouth with her own army she was blinded for a little season but she's coming together in I promise it the an event gentle will be then they are looking for a messiah I like this part you know God was at one time can you forget Israel he said haha this disguise a deep is the earth measure the Prophet said I can't he said neither can I ever forget Israel it's an apple on my own I know this is the last time jesus said when you see the fig tree when the fourth is but no one at the time is nigh even at the door it really began to be restored they got their own mind about four weeks ago she is her own currency everything she's the whole nation what a weight if all of this was in it sixty because of this it was sort of was always a type of the church that was the church national business church spiritually they were called out and as soon as they were called out they passed through the Red Sea baptized on the motor and it suddenly came on the other side they were baptized now the spirit Marian picked up tambourine and down the bank she went dancing hallelujah yes sir she had the victory we sure ever get that much all right she was dancing in the spirit and all the daughters of Israel follow her dancing Moses stood with his hands up and sang in the spirit speak to the rock now we're going to talk about Germany how God brought his people out of Egypt into the Promised Land perfect type leaving sin and coming to the spirit blame now there's three stages of the journey first Israel in Jupiter Egypt Israel in that journey Israel and Palestine we should perfect type justification by faith coming up thank the petition as they pass through their blood and baptism the Holy Ghost is perfect the stages of the church and I believe the meeting is ahead right now it's going to bring the gospel to the Jews again in Palestine and then a Gentile is finished my name's you Jews received the Holy Ghost again in Palestine you Gentiles are finished your screen proud to do whatever you want to but mercy has truly starting to Israel again that's right a Gentile goes down the wall not till they can tell dispensation we'll be finished and then it's over for you so you right now is God you sure that's right [Music] the message Redemption and completeness we take the Israel 9 their journey coming out of Egypt top of the world on their way to Palestine that promised man I think it's a beautiful beautiful thing I just love it 39a a week I sit down and read through the book Exodus I like to put that I actually like to talk about Moses because I can't talk and if I can or as much as I can my daughter because her type of the church today the condition and how God is moving and moving then well he did it and that's well then he's doing this critter last year not only Israel that natural where they see look move them out of a certain man into another natural and now we're moved by the Holy Spirit and born now into the Promised Land and the message impeccable gods both work remember when arab-israel went down into each other they never lost their covenant they just lost their blessing their covenants Gus come and stay the same you're sure God already made it with Abraham no matter where they go he'll still still made it that's right it's still there in that sheet they see supper says duh and they seat opposite the gate of enemies and the scripture said that when we were getting Christ we become Abraham see Paul speaks of it that which which is Jew non Jew in relief a Jew what were able Jew Emory therefore kid you were born of the Spirit are your Abraham see or hear that Abraham according to the promisee every problem the God gave Abraham is just because virginity or Abraham seen here more of a Jew than you would be to have born in the Jewish blood and then be an art photography in that church and deny that precious Holy Spirit or Jesus Christ you're more of a Jew because you're a Jew there's bones of a promise from heaven whose God gave Abraham and Abraham accepted that my faith and that's what made him what he was after all a Jew be just a separation and crossed over even or so forth attest marriage of the land Abraham's seed with Isaac every time see Isaac which was Jewish that and natural but the bro seed was Christ through the promise and that was Christ was does work mate meant that in it innocent our hearts today that we eat abide in me and our that's what you will have be done for you for sinking on why didn't he manifests himself Jesus when he was on earth to a gentleman that same sign to show that because the Gentile were looking for no Messiah the Jews were looking for a messiah and the Samaritans were different aside in the demon assist manifested himself as the Messiah until Peter when he preached the kingdom and blind environment on his face stuff him and their woman with about issue support of the Jews but here is now before the Samaritan and he comes to this America himself know that the truth Messiah now for for hundreds of years for true sense Americans have believed that theirs was coming in Messiah so the Messiah was on earth itself to and massage to manifest himself Church choosing north of grace that's the way it is today that's the way it was four years ago with our fathers of Pentecost his father's where's that give them the revolver had brought them out of the world and neither care that they were in in their form of denomination organization and so forth and it brought them to the greater the revolve they ever had before of the Holy Ghost upon them filled him with a spirit they were singing that's an in the spirit and then a wonderful time and little did they know that they were all these years and away from full promise but it was what it was but his real natural so it is with is no spiritual we are Israelites because we are the seed of Abraham that Israelite is not that which is of the quest that they which is at the spirit we've been an equesticle Abraham see you know
