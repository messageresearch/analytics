[30:02] it a couple years ago and it's always
[30:03] worked out well we'll be here between 6
[30:04] and 6 30. so sisters get together please
[30:07] and do that brother chris
[30:09] we'll be preaching about 8 30 and then
[30:11] afterwards
[30:12] we will have singing until midnight and

[30:16] will be our communion for january so we
[30:18] won't have communion on january the 2nd

[34:51] sister trudy you know what the brain

[34:55] um mcmillan you know what she brings
[34:57] that shrimp she brings that round thing
[35:00] to shrimp and it ain't for y'all
[35:03] it's for brother dale
[35:06] this brother now
[35:08] no it's i love it because she brings it
[35:10] every year but
[35:12] god bless you we love you with the love
[35:13] of the lord and thank you for all the
[35:14] things really you've done it's been a
[35:15] wonderful time i hope you had a good
[35:16] holiday yesterday
[35:18] and remember that uh we know jesus
[35:21] wasn't born on christmas but
[35:23] we can still remember the blessings that
[35:24] he give us every day of the year amen he
[35:27] blessed us and give us life
[35:29] and then he blessed us again by giving
[35:30] us eternal life
[35:32] amen so in the beginning was the word
[35:34] the word was with god and the word was
[35:36] god the same was in the beginning with
[35:37] god all things were made by him and
[35:39] without him was not anything made that
[35:41] was made
[35:42] in him was life and life was the light
[35:44] of men
[35:45] the light shineth in darkness and the
[35:47] darkness comprehended it not it was a
[35:49] man sent from god his name was john
[35:51] and what did john come to do he come to
[35:53] introduce the head
[35:55] that's what we're going to talk about
[35:56] today
[35:57] at the end of the service here we're
[35:58] going to once we get our background
[36:00] again we're going to talk about the
[36:01] headstone all right because that's what
[36:02] he was that's what he still is
[36:05] and there's a reason why he had to come
[36:07] back in the end time
[36:08] amen and the light shineth in darkness
[36:10] and the darkness comprehended it not
[36:12] there was a man sent from god whose name
[36:14] was john the same came for a witness to
[36:16] bear witness of the light that all men
[36:19] through him might believe
[36:21] and i think it's an honor today that we
[36:23] can stand here and read about john the
[36:25] baptist
[36:27] and know that there was an elijah number
[36:30] four that showed up
[36:32] right
[36:34] in our time
[36:35] that we can read about
[36:37] that he introduced the headstone to the
[36:39] to the church
[36:40] and that we can read this and know that
[36:42] john did it but see the same parallel as
[36:44] what we have here in the end time that's
[36:46] exactly what happened again god sent us
[36:49] a man
[36:50] named william branham
[36:53] with the spirit of elijah on him to do
[36:55] the same identical thing
[36:57] okay
[36:59] but now what he did is though he turned
[37:00] the hearts of the children to the
[37:02] fathers
[37:03] the babylon babies he turned them to the
[37:04] fathers all right and that was the
[37:06] difference in him and john john was
[37:08] turning the old the old testament
[37:10] fathers to the new testament church all
[37:12] right he was the he was the um the link
[37:16] and we had a pro need a prophet in the
[37:18] end time to do the same thing to link us
[37:20] together who link us in christ together
[37:22] not us and william branham together us
[37:24] in christ together because that's what
[37:26] john said and i'll read it to you maybe
[37:28] later on john says i must decrease
[37:30] that he may increase amen listen god's
[37:33] not going to share his glory with nobody
[37:36] amen and i don't want anybody to share
[37:38] it with me i want him to be my my owner
[37:41] my god my friend my lover my husband i
[37:43] want that's what i want him to be i
[37:45] don't want him to be anything different
[37:47] he came into his own in his own received
[37:49] him not but as many as received him to
[37:51] to them
[37:52] gave he power to become the sons of god
[37:54] even to them that believe on his name
[37:56] which are born not of blood nor the will
[37:58] of the flesh nor the will of man but of
[38:00] god and the word was made flesh and
[38:02] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[38:04] as the glory of the only begotten of the
[38:05] father
[38:06] full
[38:07] of grace and truth now let's read
[38:08] hebrews 10 5
[38:10] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[38:12] he says sacrifice an offering thou would
[38:13] us not
[38:14] but a body yes hast thou prepared me now
[38:17] what does the body
[38:19] it has a head on it
[38:22] and the head is where the intelligence
[38:23] is if you don't have anything in your
[38:25] head it's not you're not going to have
[38:26] anything to do with your body because
[38:27] listen ephesians 5 23 says for the
[38:30] husband is the head of the wife even as
[38:32] christ is the head of the church and he
[38:34] is the savior
[38:36] of that body
[38:37] and man we got to have jesus christ to
[38:40] save us because our body
[38:42] was rotten
[38:44] our body was born in sin shaping an
[38:46] iniquity espoused from our mother's womb
[38:47] but he gave us a chance to get out of
[38:49] that man you may be seated in the lord
[38:51] at his blessing
[38:52] to the reading of the word
[38:54] and colossians 1 15 i love this right
[38:57] here this let's read this
[38:58] one because we're going to make a few
[39:00] comments and then come back to it
[39:01] colossians 1 15. it says who is the
[39:04] image of the invisible god the firstborn
[39:07] of every creature now we're going to get
[39:08] into that in a minute in revelations 3
[39:10] 14. he was the beginning of the creation
[39:12] of god amen when god became flesh amen
[39:16] the book of psalms tells us heaven and
[39:18] earth has kissed they've come together
[39:20] they've met amen heaven came down
[39:24] heaven came down to earth and became
[39:26] flesh that's why i do love the christmas
[39:29] story
[39:30] we know it's not got anything to do with
[39:31] santa claus and even december the 25th
[39:34] we know that's not true but we know one
[39:36] thing's for sure he had to be born on a
[39:38] certain day
[39:38] there was a day he was born he was born
[39:40] a lamb in april we know that
[39:43] but we're into this in this world and
[39:45] i've never seen anybody that's
[39:47] complained about getting a gift on
[39:48] december 24th to 25th so
[39:51] amen
[39:52] that's what i thought so if you take a
[39:54] gift that's okay who is the image of the
[39:57] invisible god the firstborn of every
[39:58] creature
[40:00] for by him were all things created that
[40:02] are in heaven and that are in earth now
[40:04] this is this man that we're going to
[40:06] we're talking about this son of man
[40:08] visible and invisible whether they be
[40:09] thrones or dominions or principalities
[40:11] or powers all things were created by him
[40:13] and for him
[40:15] all right and he is before all things
[40:17] and by him all things consist
[40:20] pretty powerful
[40:22] but watch though he brings it down he
[40:24] says and he is the head of the body
[40:27] the church
[40:28] knocked out there
[40:31] the bride
[40:32] he is the head of the body the bride who
[40:34] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[40:36] dead
[40:37] what
[40:39] listen it's okay that he was born a baby
[40:41] it's okay that he died at calvary
[40:44] but if he had not resurrected
[40:47] if he had not come out of that grave
[40:48] brother brown said that's when he proved
[40:50] who he was it's when he said you destroy
[40:53] this body in three days i'll raise it
[40:55] back up
[40:57] lazarus depended on jesus to resurrect
[41:00] him
[41:01] we're gonna have to depend on jesus to
[41:03] resurrect us but he didn't have to
[41:04] depend on nobody to resurrect him
[41:06] because he was the resurrection and i
[41:08] hope we get into that a little bit more
[41:09] later on in the year because when he
[41:11] stood and said i am the resurrection in
[41:13] life that is the ministry of the son of
[41:15] man
[41:17] i'm here i'm here to resurrect you i'm
[41:20] here to change you and i'm here to take
[41:21] you in the rapture
[41:22] amen
[41:24] everybody all right with that
[41:26] and he is before all things and by him
[41:27] all things consistent he is the head of
[41:29] the body the church
[41:32] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[41:34] the dead then in all things he might
[41:36] have the preeminence that's what we need
[41:37] to work on that's why i'm telling you we
[41:40] need to let out what we got inside of us
[41:41] this year
[41:43] let it out
[41:44] start praising god run the aisles do
[41:46] what do something amen study the bible
[41:49] more read more pray more shout more amen
[41:54] this is okay
[41:56] this is all right
[42:02] but i promise you yesterday when y'all
[42:04] was opening some of your presents you
[42:05] didn't just go
[42:07] thanks
[42:10] rightly
[42:12] you're like wow that's what i've always
[42:14] wanted
[42:15] right
[42:16] oh you brought me this you bought me
[42:18] well you know what that rap gift i told
[42:20] you about
[42:21] he brought you a gift of eternal life
[42:24] amen
[42:26] and he unwrapped it
[42:28] and then he wrapped it back up in you
[42:30] amen because you and i
[42:32] are part of that headstone head
[42:36] we're the body
[42:37] that's why jesus can't come back until
[42:39] we
[42:40] connect with him here
[42:42] spiritually
[42:44] then we come back naturally in the
[42:46] millennium for him to be the head
[42:49] and that's to be the body but
[42:51] spiritually it's got to happen now
[42:52] because that's when we connect and
[42:54] there's many many quotes and we'll read
[42:55] them later on uh next year there's many
[42:58] many quotes that brother brown says the
[42:59] head and head and the body has to unite
[43:02] because what would be a person walking
[43:04] around with no head amen
[43:06] amen
[43:08] you wouldn't know where to go what to do
[43:09] you couldn't see
[43:11] everything comes from right here
[43:13] amen so we've got to have the headstone
[43:15] here or the head man the head person
[43:17] the head of the body the church that's
[43:19] why he had to come back in the end time
[43:21] because they rejected him
[43:24] and they've rejected him all down
[43:26] through time
[43:28] they sure rejected him when he was on
[43:30] earth
[43:31] but let's read let's continue on but he
[43:33] is the body he is the head of the body
[43:35] of the church who in the who is the
[43:36] beginning
[43:38] the firstborn from the dead he had to
[43:40] come in human flesh he had to die
[43:43] to give you eternal life that in all
[43:45] things he might have the preeminence for
[43:46] it please the father that in him should
[43:49] all fullness dwell
[43:51] amen he wasn't part god he wasn't the
[43:54] second person of a trinity
[43:56] he wasn't even the first person of the
[43:58] trinity
[44:00] he is a triune being
[44:03] he was a father
[44:05] when he was in the old testament
[44:07] the son of god
[44:08] jesus told us that we worship in spirit
[44:12] and in truth
[44:13] in other words you'll find out who the
[44:14] father is if you'll start worshipping
[44:16] him spirit and in truth you'll find out
[44:19] who my father is and then he comes to
[44:21] philip one day and he says philip
[44:24] if you've seen me
[44:26] now listen he's a liar
[44:29] if there's a father somewhere else
[44:31] another person standing
[44:33] right
[44:35] he said if he's seen me you've seen the
[44:37] father
[44:38] i am the father expressed in the son of
[44:41] man
[44:42] that's why the son of man is me and you
[44:44] that's what are me in you
[44:46] where the father expressed
[44:48] yes because we're sons and daughters of
[44:51] god
[44:52] so we are the father of stress that's
[44:53] why i say we we take we take the lord
[44:56] jesus and we bottle him up and say boy
[44:57] that's the son of man and he's the
[44:58] fullness of the godhead body and he's
[44:59] this and he's that and he's the other
[45:01] well now what'd he do
[45:02] did he leave it there
[45:05] no he came back on the day of pentecost
[45:06] and he poured it out
[45:08] into believers
[45:10] amen not mate believers not unbelievers
[45:13] but true believers yes
[45:14] right
[45:15] for it please the father that in him
[45:17] should all fullest dwell
[45:19] now let's read the first quote we've
[45:21] been reading it for a while but i want
[45:22] you to understand
[45:24] that jesus only came according to the
[45:26] word
[45:27] so you and i can come only according to
[45:30] the word that's why if your wife you're
[45:33] listening and watching this screen when
[45:35] brother branham is preaching on the 70
[45:38] weeks of daniel
[45:40] he brings it straight out of the bible
[45:43] he says there's three distinct periods
[45:47] and there is three distinct periods in
[45:49] the bible
[45:54] a 62 a seven and one
[45:58] one not any halves
[46:01] everybody got that you see what people
[46:03] people have said this and that and the
[46:04] other and he said well i got a quote it
[46:06] can't it's got to match the bible
[46:09] everything has to match the bible
[46:10] because that's where jesus came out of
[46:14] so if so if brother brown is going to
[46:15] introduce
[46:17] the full headship
[46:19] there can't be one word missing
[46:22] you can't can't resurrect part
[46:25] that's why this fourth elijah had to
[46:27] restore all things and we'll read it too
[46:28] in a minute because brother brown told i
[46:30] mean jesus told him said
[46:32] this elijah will come and restore all
[46:34] things
[46:36] amen
[46:40] i thank god he sent us a prophet
[46:44] because we'd just be
[46:47] we'd be floundering around wouldn't know
[46:48] what we were doing
[46:50] folks think about that
[46:52] i want you to think about that
[46:54] and the world's deceived with
[46:56] denominational ideas that ain't even in
[46:58] the bible
[46:59] but it's their tradition
[47:02] jesus told them one day said your
[47:03] tradition is killing you
[47:06] because your tradition is not what i'm
[47:07] looking for
[47:09] i'm looking for my word to be made
[47:11] manifest word by word by word
[47:14] because i brought it to you and i gave
[47:16] it to you in plain english
[47:20] remember that's what i was telling you
[47:21] the other day and it's what i was
[47:22] telling brother richard hyatt
[47:24] there's no need to get into argument
[47:26] with anybody about the word of god
[47:28] but when they say well we can cut our
[47:31] hair
[47:32] well tell me where you can do that in
[47:34] the bible
[47:36] i can read plain english that said you
[47:38] sisters are not supposed to cut your
[47:40] hair
[47:41] out of the bible not out of a william
[47:43] branham book
[47:45] he didn't bring us a new way to live
[47:49] he come to tell us what god already has
[47:52] said in the bible
[47:54] there's nothing that we live by that we
[47:56] can't take to the bible
[47:58] what about your religion what about your
[48:00] denominational idea what about any of
[48:02] your ideas
[48:04] sitting in this building today same way
[48:06] with like daniel 70 weeks they got all
[48:07] this you know about well there's only
[48:09] three and a half years left after the
[48:11] rapture well
[48:12] the bible doesn't say that
[48:15] the prophet of god is fixing to tell you
[48:16] in just a few minutes tomorrow whenever
[48:18] we play this again he's fixing to tell
[48:21] you that there's one week left after the
[48:22] rapture because the bible says so
[48:25] i mean good grief people come on
[48:29] we're either going to believe this
[48:30] message all the way or we're not going
[48:31] to we're going to stay here
[48:34] you're going to believe it all the way
[48:35] or you're going to stay here because you
[48:37] know too much you've heard you've
[48:38] listened you know
[48:39] all of us i'm talking about all of us
[48:42] if we leave if we stay here we are the
[48:45] ones that did it
[48:47] don't blame god and don't even blame the
[48:49] devil
[48:50] you better blame yourself
[48:52] amen
[48:53] because we've been given the word of god
[48:56] we've been given every i means like the
[48:58] old colored brother says from giver to
[49:00] giver from kenner to kevin we've got the
[49:03] bible
[49:04] and it's been open to us like i said
[49:06] before jesus opened the book that day
[49:08] and read where he was supposed to be
[49:10] to do these things we'll read it in a
[49:11] minute
[49:12] then he closed it back up
[49:15] and he handed it back to the people
[49:18] but he was the open book
[49:20] he was the one we were looking for
[49:23] that
[49:24] that what he might have the preeminence
[49:26] in what
[49:28] in himself
[49:29] no in the church
[49:31] in his body in his bride
[49:33] he don't want a bride that's slopping
[49:35] around with the world he don't want a
[49:36] bride that's not a virgin
[49:38] a man
[49:42] let's read the masterpiece right here
[49:46] the body was built read the red built by
[49:48] the word which was the prophets and here
[49:51] comes the head of it all
[49:53] jesus came on the scene
[49:56] then when this head piece was put upon
[49:58] it we find in him the entire handiwork
[50:01] of god
[50:03] because the bible tells us in him dwelt
[50:05] the fullness
[50:06] of the godhead bother which is what
[50:08] father son and holy ghost we believe in
[50:10] those titles
[50:11] but they're titles
[50:12] to one person
[50:14] not different personalities
[50:17] we don't have a schizophrenic god
[50:20] no he's one person
[50:22] but he can do just like i did
[50:24] yesterday i portrayed myself yesterday
[50:28] as
[50:29] a father
[50:32] because some of my children came home
[50:33] with me some didn't
[50:36] sitting in the back waving
[50:39] because of other things
[50:41] that we'll not get into but anyway no
[50:43] but i portrayed when i woke up though
[50:45] but when i woke up yesterday morning
[50:48] let's just be honest i was in bed with
[50:50] my wife and i was a husband
[50:52] right
[50:53] but now that don't happen with the
[50:55] children
[50:56] but when i moved over into the role of
[50:59] father
[51:00] i displayed it to my kids
[51:02] then my grand girl showed up
[51:07] he's back there waving
[51:10] so i moved over into what the role of
[51:11] grandpa
[51:15] god
[51:16] fulfilled jehovah
[51:19] father of everything
[51:21] creator of heaven and earth but that
[51:23] same man
[51:24] moved over into the sun
[51:27] and became the son of man
[51:29] same person but he had a different title
[51:32] amen
[51:34] then he moved over on the day of
[51:35] pentecost and he came as the holy ghost
[51:38] right same person
[51:40] same person
[51:43] same attribute
[51:45] but he moved over into the form of the
[51:47] holy ghost so he could come inside of me
[51:48] and you
[51:52] if not he's got two bodies he's standing
[51:54] here as the son of man and if he moved
[51:56] over on the day of pentecost and he
[51:57] stayed here
[51:59] as a human stayed here
[52:02] he couldn't fulfill the word because it
[52:04] couldn't come back into me and you'd
[52:05] have two bodies here and that would make
[52:07] him a trinitarian
[52:10] but it's not
[52:12] it's one god
[52:14] with one personality
[52:15] with one ultimate goal and that was to
[52:19] create a group of people that would
[52:21] worship him for an eternity
[52:24] and be intimate with him
[52:26] for an eternity not just something
[52:28] that's waning
[52:30] video love wanes it goes back and forth
[52:32] up and down you know i love my wife and
[52:34] then i don't like her too much today and
[52:36] you know
[52:37] and there's some things god don't like
[52:38] that we do
[52:39] but we're still his wife
[52:41] amen
[52:42] right we may get some weapons every once
[52:44] why not lo don't whip your wife
[52:46] don't don't do that
[52:48] but he can whip us because he whips us
[52:49] with nail scarred hands
[52:51] he whips us with the word of god
[52:55] and it is hot up here too uh well
[52:57] aaron's not here
[52:58] brother is that is the uh
[53:01] fan on see if the fan's on
[53:05] because everybody's fanning
[53:07] and i'm getting a little warm
[53:08] all the way down
[53:10] there you go okay all right
[53:12] we'll just suffer through it
[53:14] nobody falls asleep
[53:16] but the body was built by the word which
[53:18] was the prophets and here comes the head
[53:20] of it all jesus came on the scene that's
[53:24] when this headpiece was put upon it now
[53:26] what was the head piece
[53:29] the baby
[53:31] the son of man when that when that
[53:33] produced when the prophets produced a
[53:35] flesh
[53:38] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[53:41] us that's when it produced that's when
[53:43] the the prophets
[53:45] that's why when jesus stood there
[53:47] and just like what we do we we stand we
[53:50] stand in the world and i think we're odd
[53:52] and we're crazy we're different praise
[53:54] god
[53:56] praise god
[53:57] the bible never tells you to act like
[53:59] the world
[54:01] never
[54:02] tells you to act like the world
[54:04] it says you're going to be in the world
[54:06] but not of the world
[54:10] i want them to know i'm different
[54:14] i want them to know i'm a little crazy
[54:17] but i want them to come and tell me what
[54:18] in what my belief is not in the bible
[54:21] and what their belief
[54:22] is not in the bible
[54:24] i want them to talk to me about that
[54:27] not about well y'all believe this
[54:28] prophet and he's this
[54:32] we have prophets all over the place
[54:35] that was prophets in the in the new
[54:36] testament agaves and different ones that
[54:38] were that were prophets
[54:40] that you didn't hear anything about but
[54:42] they were prophets
[54:43] god spoke through them
[54:45] so what's the difference now
[54:47] you know why it's like i said before
[54:49] when you got james dobson and all the
[54:50] different ones max lucado and all they
[54:52] write some good stuff okay
[54:55] but they didn't bring me a word
[54:57] to change my body
[54:59] they didn't bring me the headstone
[55:01] they didn't bring me the head of the
[55:02] church the intelligence of the church
[55:04] because the intelligence of the church
[55:06] will point you right back to the bible
[55:09] and say this is what i've already said
[55:12] not what i'm going to say this is what
[55:14] i've already said
[55:16] right here
[55:18] face final resting place the prophet
[55:20] said is in the word of god
[55:23] the word of god
[55:25] and that's what we believe
[55:29] because remember jesus was the word
[55:32] he was not a piece of the word he didn't
[55:34] come to be part of the word
[55:36] he was the fullness of the word
[55:38] everything he did
[55:40] reflected the word and everything he did
[55:42] reflected what me and you're supposed to
[55:43] do why do you think paul and peter could
[55:46] write the rest of the new testament
[55:48] because of matthew mark luke and john
[55:50] because of the commentary and the ones
[55:52] that were there with them already
[55:54] peter james
[55:56] john were there now paul wasn't but paul
[55:58] by revelation that's why paul says i was
[56:00] one born out of due time
[56:02] but i got the same understanding that
[56:04] you got
[56:07] it's a little rough when
[56:09] brother bob you
[56:11] you take paul and you take peter and
[56:13] they come from way too different
[56:17] avenues of getting to be christianity
[56:19] you know this is an old rough fisherman
[56:22] that kirsten was naked most of the time
[56:24] okay let's just be real and he always
[56:26] wanted to fight
[56:28] i'm fisherman i always want to fight
[56:31] so he's
[56:32] even right up to the garden he wanted to
[56:33] fight we're going to take his place over
[56:35] jesus we're going to take over jesus
[56:37] looked at him and said
[56:39] sorry that's not for you to do but then
[56:41] you got paul well learned scholared
[56:44] he said i was reading them yesterday in
[56:46] the in my uh bible study i was reading
[56:49] where paul said a pharisee of the
[56:52] pharisees
[56:53] according to the law
[56:55] he was blameless
[56:59] blameless
[57:01] peter didn't fit that
[57:05] peter didn't fit that spot
[57:08] paul persecuted
[57:10] christians paul was
[57:13] scholared and learned he knew what he
[57:15] was talking about
[57:17] but when the holy ghost came on peter
[57:19] and the holy ghost came on paul same
[57:21] person
[57:23] when they come together
[57:25] they were preaching the same thing
[57:30] now most of us come from different walks
[57:32] of life and i'm talking about ministry
[57:33] and everything else but us being the way
[57:36] we are now in the message of the hour
[57:37] how can you bring one over here with
[57:39] this one over here and bring them
[57:40] together and you're preaching the exact
[57:42] same thing
[57:43] very very few
[57:45] not common to do that why because satan
[57:48] has gone into just like he got in all
[57:49] the other denominations and divided
[57:51] everything he's divided everything up
[57:53] but listen somebody
[57:55] has got to produce this headstone
[57:58] and i'm just saying it's us
[58:00] amen i'm just saying it's me and you
[58:02] we have a chance to do that
[58:04] [Applause]
[58:07] some people will never have a chance to
[58:09] do what you can do and what we're going
[58:11] to do
[58:13] [Music]
[58:14] which was the prophets and here comes
[58:16] the head of it all like i was saying
[58:18] you got the max locators you got the
[58:20] this one you got that one you got jensen
[58:22] franklin you got all these different
[58:23] ones good good guys good i say chris
[58:26] nominal christian men but they don't
[58:28] bring a message to change your body
[58:30] something's off
[58:34] that's why they don't like when you when
[58:35] you say their name is okay but when you
[58:37] say william brown's name they go
[58:40] why because he came different
[58:44] he brought the word 100 percent
[58:47] they didn't
[58:49] they brought part of the body that's
[58:50] okay they had their time
[58:52] but we're under the ministry of the son
[58:54] of man which what
[58:56] he wasn't like god
[58:58] he was god
[59:00] amen i don't want to be like god
[59:02] and i know we sing that song to be like
[59:03] jesus well that's okay be nice
[59:06] but if you don't have them inside of you
[59:08] you can interpret that your own way
[59:12] you ask people outside you say are you a
[59:14] christian yeah i'm a christian
[59:18] have me a beer you know
[59:21] their opinion of christianity is not our
[59:23] opinion of christianity
[59:24] in our opinion see listen folks we're
[59:26] not living under an opinion that's right
[59:29] listen to me jesus was not a good
[59:31] opinion
[59:34] he was the word
[59:37] total
[59:38] when you pick this book up you pick up
[59:40] the son of man
[59:42] you pick up what he did on earth 2 000
[59:44] years ago as god almighty in human flesh
[59:49] and when we read it we read about that
[59:51] man that never will change
[59:53] we can't change him to match us
[59:56] we have to change us i thought the bible
[59:58] said we're changed into his image
[1:00:01] amen so what is his image
[1:00:04] not
[1:00:05] the worldly image
[1:00:07] that most people produce
[1:00:08] come on people
[1:00:10] he was so different
[1:00:13] as the son of man he walked on this
[1:00:14] earth so different the denominations
[1:00:17] hated him
[1:00:19] they wanted to kill him
[1:00:22] you know what if it hadn't been for that
[1:00:23] anointing for him to preach that message
[1:00:25] for three and a half years they probably
[1:00:26] would have killed him
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:29] but remember the anointing left him in
[1:00:30] the garden so he could die so they could
[1:00:32] kill him
[1:00:34] and they got what they wanted
[1:00:36] they wanted that man out of the way
[1:00:38] they just didn't know that on the day of
[1:00:40] pentecost
[1:00:41] here come 120 of them people that they
[1:00:43] killed one for
[1:00:45] and then 3 000 came that they were
[1:00:46] trying to kill that one for and now
[1:00:48] millions of people christians in the
[1:00:50] world
[1:00:51] that are producing jesus christ that's
[1:00:53] what we're supposed to do not produce a
[1:00:54] man
[1:00:57] but it took a man to come here to preach
[1:00:59] that gospel to us
[1:01:01] because we were so messed up listen
[1:01:03] every time you look in the bible
[1:01:06] every time man started getting off i'm
[1:01:10] talking about the old testament
[1:01:12] every time man started getting off and
[1:01:14] getting away from the law getting away
[1:01:15] from this god sent them a messenger
[1:01:19] right
[1:01:20] even ezra nehemiah all those different
[1:01:23] ones you watch god sent them in a
[1:01:26] pivotal time of israel's
[1:01:28] journey career whatever you want to say
[1:01:31] look at moses
[1:01:34] critical time they were in captivity
[1:01:37] they were getting old
[1:01:39] they were wanting to get in the promised
[1:01:40] land
[1:01:41] so god sent them a prophet
[1:01:46] they wanted to leave as daniel 70 wheat
[1:01:48] so tell you they were getting ready to
[1:01:49] leave and go out of captivity well where
[1:01:50] do we go well how do we get there
[1:01:53] god sends them ezra god sends them
[1:01:55] nehemiah
[1:01:56] god sends them all these different
[1:01:58] prophets to what line them back up
[1:02:02] same thing folks
[1:02:04] in the new testament god sent us a
[1:02:07] prophet
[1:02:08] to line this thing back up
[1:02:10] to get us in the right way
[1:02:12] you say oh this is tough listen you get
[1:02:14] the baptism of the holy ghost it is not
[1:02:16] tough to live this life
[1:02:20] the reason you can't live this life is
[1:02:21] you don't have the holy ghost
[1:02:25] i'm just going to let the rubber meet
[1:02:26] the road today
[1:02:28] okay
[1:02:29] that all right
[1:02:31] because in revelation 3 14 this is to
[1:02:34] the angel of the church of the laodicea
[1:02:37] and so now that's us right
[1:02:39] this is to the messenger
[1:02:41] right pull it up there um
[1:02:43] be revelation 3 14.
[1:02:47] and to the angel of the church of the
[1:02:48] layout of sins now angel
[1:02:51] messenger right
[1:02:52] so that would be our seventh angel
[1:02:55] messenger which we know for surety who
[1:02:58] that is
[1:02:59] and god sent him to us what the church
[1:03:02] of the laodiceans
[1:03:04] these things saith the amen the faithful
[1:03:06] true witness the beginning of the
[1:03:07] creation of god do you know now listen
[1:03:10] don't get me wrong
[1:03:12] they had the new birth down through the
[1:03:14] old down through the church ages
[1:03:15] everybody got that yes
[1:03:17] but they didn't get the fullness
[1:03:20] i read you that when we were talking
[1:03:21] about eternal redemption they got just
[1:03:22] enough to get saved just enough to get
[1:03:24] sanctified just enough to get the holy
[1:03:26] ghost and say i'm a christian and give
[1:03:28] their life for the gospel and all the
[1:03:30] different things but the
[1:03:32] beginning of the creation of god
[1:03:36] we know that happened 2000 years ago
[1:03:39] but listen the continuation of that
[1:03:41] creation did not fully come
[1:03:44] until the seals broke
[1:03:48] boy that brought it way on up here did
[1:03:50] it y'all thought i was gonna say on the
[1:03:51] day of pentecost partly the way it did
[1:03:56] that was the building of the body
[1:03:59] but now when we come to laodicea it says
[1:04:02] the beginning
[1:04:03] of the creation of god
[1:04:06] that now jesus christ is back in human
[1:04:08] form again
[1:04:10] in a bride because of the angel that
[1:04:14] brought us a message
[1:04:16] amen
[1:04:17] it's okay to have all these other
[1:04:18] messengers that's fine but this one did
[1:04:22] two things remember
[1:04:24] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:04:26] the pentecostal fathers what the bible
[1:04:30] but you know what he would stand there
[1:04:31] and condemn women preachers and condemn
[1:04:33] women for cutting their hair and condemn
[1:04:35] women women from wearing paint and you
[1:04:37] know what that's been 60-something years
[1:04:39] ago they did one denomination and go out
[1:04:41] of business
[1:04:43] they're still here
[1:04:45] they didn't i mean sure they some people
[1:04:46] were converted but they just kept going
[1:04:48] brother brown even said he
[1:04:50] he said y'all just get worse every year
[1:04:52] right i'm talking about those supposed
[1:04:55] to be the epitome the the the head at
[1:04:57] the time
[1:04:59] you understand what i mean the
[1:05:00] pentecostal church was supposed to be
[1:05:01] the cleanest living and the closest
[1:05:04] living the holiness the closest living
[1:05:06] to god
[1:05:08] he said in 20 years he said you'll be
[1:05:10] worse than the catholic church took 2
[1:05:12] 000 years
[1:05:13] because they thought they had it
[1:05:16] and they didn't
[1:05:18] they thought they had
[1:05:21] the latter rain they thought they had
[1:05:22] the headstones they thought the lord was
[1:05:24] coming they thought they were the church
[1:05:27] that the lord was going to come to
[1:05:29] and brother brown said no
[1:05:32] he said you've not even had your
[1:05:33] teaching green yet
[1:05:36] and that's what's been going on we've
[1:05:38] had a good teaching rain going on but
[1:05:39] now there's going to be a harvest folks
[1:05:42] you know what you don't leave your
[1:05:43] harvest why how would you why would you
[1:05:48] put forth an effort
[1:05:51] to plant
[1:05:52] 10 rows of green beans or
[1:05:55] tomatoes
[1:05:57] and then just never go back to it
[1:06:02] what's going to happen that fruit is
[1:06:03] going to rot
[1:06:06] die
[1:06:07] on the vine good fruit
[1:06:10] hey good fruit good beans good tomatoes
[1:06:13] and like me and lisa it's hard for a
[1:06:15] good tomato to go bad in our place
[1:06:16] because we eat them too much we eat them
[1:06:18] now sister june she might throw them out
[1:06:20] but that's okay
[1:06:22] but think about what i'm saying is god
[1:06:24] planted it and he's going to have a
[1:06:26] harvest there's going to be a harvest
[1:06:29] of a ripe fruit
[1:06:31] call the bride
[1:06:33] and there's going to be a harvest
[1:06:35] not just growing it out and saying oh
[1:06:36] that's beautiful that's pretty like the
[1:06:38] pentecost they shouted it out they said
[1:06:39] oh this is it this is it this is it
[1:06:42] then they said the evidence of the holy
[1:06:43] ghost is speaking in tongues and they
[1:06:46] shut the door
[1:06:48] they put god out because in revelation 3
[1:06:50] 14 on down to 16 or 17 what'd you say
[1:06:52] behold i stand at the door or not
[1:06:55] that was the son of man trying to get
[1:06:57] back in
[1:06:58] see we've got to let the son of man back
[1:07:00] in our door
[1:07:02] for us to take a body change
[1:07:05] that may be hard for somebody to
[1:07:07] to listen to but
[1:07:14] everything you know down here has a time
[1:07:15] limit
[1:07:17] i was thinking about this everything has
[1:07:18] a time limit when you play a basketball
[1:07:20] game you got every how many minutes
[1:07:22] you play a football game you got four
[1:07:24] quarters 15 minutes a quarter
[1:07:26] right
[1:07:27] there is an end to the game
[1:07:29] okay there is an end to the first
[1:07:32] quarter there is an end to the second
[1:07:33] quarter when that clock goes zero zero
[1:07:35] zero they stop the game
[1:07:38] that's the same way with god
[1:07:40] when he give us a gentile dispensation
[1:07:42] he sent us a prophet he sent us the word
[1:07:44] of god he sent us an absolute wonderful
[1:07:46] fivefold ministry to bring the word of
[1:07:48] god and break it down to the people
[1:07:50] somewhere that clock's gonna hit zero
[1:07:53] zero zero zero
[1:07:56] the game's gonna be over
[1:07:59] and somebody wins
[1:08:01] and somebody loses
[1:08:02] amen
[1:08:04] if you're with god you always win
[1:08:07] revelation 3 14 talks about the
[1:08:09] beginning of the creation of god listen
[1:08:10] to this quote god's gift always finds
[1:08:12] her places number two
[1:08:14] and he was a being on earth a being of
[1:08:16] time
[1:08:17] which means that he must have had a
[1:08:19] beginning therefore he created himself a
[1:08:21] body
[1:08:22] to live in now how'd he create it he
[1:08:24] created it by the word i just read he
[1:08:26] created it by the prophets
[1:08:27] in the old testament that created the
[1:08:29] body for him to stand up stand out on
[1:08:32] behold a virgin shall conceive that
[1:08:33] opened a door so that could happen
[1:08:36] because it can't happen otherwise
[1:08:38] amen
[1:08:42] god himself created a body for himself
[1:08:45] see that by this creation he might save
[1:08:47] the lost creation that he created
[1:08:51] thank god
[1:08:53] look at number three the loudest in
[1:08:54] church age now show
[1:08:56] that he was the first he was the
[1:08:58] beginning of the creation of god oh do
[1:09:00] you catch it see how could god be
[1:09:02] created if he's a spirit
[1:09:04] how could he be he's he's eternal
[1:09:07] he never was created he never will be
[1:09:09] created because he was god at the
[1:09:10] beginning
[1:09:12] but he that is the beginning of the
[1:09:14] creation of god was jesus christ when he
[1:09:16] was made manifest
[1:09:18] the father stepped over into the sonship
[1:09:22] and became a baby
[1:09:23] god crying in a cradle
[1:09:26] god with no teeth
[1:09:27] god having to have a diaper change
[1:09:30] that's the kind of god i like
[1:09:33] he come down here and dwell right here
[1:09:35] with us
[1:09:36] and he was not untouchable folks
[1:09:39] this is what he's trying to tell you
[1:09:40] through the ministry he is not
[1:09:42] untouchable
[1:09:44] he wants to be held he wants to be
[1:09:48] i say used he wants to be he wants us to
[1:09:50] use his word
[1:09:52] he wants us to use what he said i think
[1:09:54] the bible talks about exercise
[1:09:57] exercise your faith
[1:09:59] what does that mean
[1:10:03] no exercise
[1:10:05] exercise your faith
[1:10:08] say be it unto me according to thy word
[1:10:12] listen to a preacher and stand up one
[1:10:13] day and say there ain't nothing but the
[1:10:14] truth preacher and see what will happen
[1:10:16] amen
[1:10:21] when god created himself a body he came
[1:10:23] down and lived in it that's the
[1:10:24] beginning of the creation of god
[1:10:26] what that's the beginning that we see
[1:10:29] that we can understand and relate to
[1:10:32] that god
[1:10:34] so eternal listen created everything
[1:10:38] i was watching a little show on youtube
[1:10:40] yesterday about the uh
[1:10:42] the um uh glaciers
[1:10:45] up in alaska and different ones that are
[1:10:47] hundreds of miles long
[1:10:49] so many miles deep of ice
[1:10:52] you know god knows every ice crystal is
[1:10:54] in that whole thing
[1:10:56] much less how many trees is on this
[1:10:58] earth already i'm talking about the
[1:11:00] whole earth how much water by volume is
[1:11:02] already here where it came from because
[1:11:04] he created it all
[1:11:06] but listen he decided to begin as a baby
[1:11:10] he decided to clean that womb out
[1:11:16] not by sexual desire
[1:11:18] but clean the womb out by creation
[1:11:21] that's why it was the beginning of the
[1:11:23] creation of god
[1:11:26] and we're a continuation i'll finally
[1:11:28] get to that quote one day where you and
[1:11:29] i are a continuation of that creation
[1:11:32] because if it had to be a beginning
[1:11:35] listen there will be an end to a gentile
[1:11:37] dispensation they'll be the last
[1:11:39] gentiles saved and no other gentiles are
[1:11:41] going to be saved like filled with the
[1:11:42] holy ghost do you ever understand that
[1:11:45] the clock will be zero zero zero zero on
[1:11:48] the gentile dispensation now that
[1:11:49] doesn't mean it ends
[1:11:51] he just takes his game to the jews
[1:11:56] and you know what
[1:11:58] they get
[1:11:59] 1260 on their clock
[1:12:02] come on somebody
[1:12:04] they get 1260 days and when that thing
[1:12:06] hits zero they're gone
[1:12:08] according to the bible
[1:12:11] what are you saying brother wade listen
[1:12:13] it's good to say well
[1:12:16] we got four quarters
[1:12:18] we're just in the first quarter
[1:12:20] we'll just we'll just kind of halfway
[1:12:22] get through this thing but boy in that
[1:12:24] fourth quarter we're going to really
[1:12:26] no
[1:12:27] yeah you better start
[1:12:29] now
[1:12:31] because listen he started right when he
[1:12:33] was the beginning of the creation of god
[1:12:35] he started the right way he wanted to
[1:12:36] start a virgin birth
[1:12:39] and me and you by the new birth listen
[1:12:41] by our old birth we were not virgin born
[1:12:45] that's right
[1:12:46] i promise you if you were born from your
[1:12:48] mama she wasn't a virgin
[1:12:51] everybody got that
[1:12:53] but god said
[1:12:56] you must be born again
[1:12:59] born from above
[1:13:01] born by creation
[1:13:05] not by
[1:13:06] well we'll read it here in just a minute
[1:13:10] how could god be created if he's a
[1:13:12] spirit only a prophet could tell us
[1:13:15] he never was created because he was god
[1:13:17] at the beginning but
[1:13:19] because of the word
[1:13:21] because of the word he was the beginning
[1:13:23] of the creation of god so that was jesus
[1:13:25] christ in the womb of a virgin
[1:13:27] that came on earth and lived and we saw
[1:13:28] all that we know in luke 20 luke 2 verse
[1:13:31] 49 he said i must be about my father's
[1:13:33] business
[1:13:34] not building cabinets
[1:13:36] but preaching the word of god amen
[1:13:39] so let's just keep going uh abby you're
[1:13:41] gonna have to slide through these pretty
[1:13:42] quick and sister abby's right back there
[1:13:44] learning how to do that
[1:13:46] got real sweaty palms probably but
[1:13:48] that's okay
[1:13:49] just keep scrolling that thing up
[1:13:53] hebrews 5 and 8 said though he were a
[1:13:55] son he learned obedience by the things
[1:13:56] which he suffered and being made perfect
[1:13:59] you say well jesus wasn't perfect
[1:14:02] his body was not perfect
[1:14:04] his human body that he decided to live
[1:14:07] in
[1:14:08] to give his
[1:14:10] life to give that
[1:14:13] listen
[1:14:14] you can't kill the son of god
[1:14:16] that's god
[1:14:18] and you didn't kill jesus they didn't
[1:14:20] kill jesus he acted the part of death we
[1:14:22] know that
[1:14:23] listen you and i act a part of death
[1:14:25] even if we have to put them in the
[1:14:27] ground it's an act
[1:14:29] because if you're born again you're more
[1:14:31] alive
[1:14:33] you're more alive when you pass from
[1:14:35] this world
[1:14:36] see that's another thing that we don't
[1:14:38] understand
[1:14:40] you're more alive there than you are
[1:14:42] here
[1:14:43] cause you got this whole thing hanging
[1:14:44] on
[1:14:46] what's the song says i'll drop this i'll
[1:14:48] drop this robe of flesh
[1:14:51] just peel this thing off
[1:14:54] step over into another dimension
[1:14:56] then you know what
[1:14:58] we're going to step back in this
[1:14:59] dimension
[1:15:00] with more power than you had in the
[1:15:03] first time
[1:15:04] and you're going to change that body you
[1:15:05] was living in
[1:15:09] huh yeah
[1:15:11] you pick up a little power when you what
[1:15:13] did jesus say he never said all power in
[1:15:15] heaven earth has been given unto me
[1:15:16] until he come to the resurrection
[1:15:20] he stood there and he said now all power
[1:15:21] in other words i have control over this
[1:15:23] body i can walk through that wall if i
[1:15:25] want to i can eat if i want to i can
[1:15:28] ascend if i want to and i can come back
[1:15:30] on the day of pentecost if i want to and
[1:15:33] we know he did because that's what the
[1:15:34] word said he was going to do
[1:15:36] all right
[1:15:37] it's all because of the word
[1:15:39] then we know he had to go and be
[1:15:40] baptized
[1:15:42] he saw a spirit of god descending like a
[1:15:44] dove and lighting on him in matthew 3
[1:15:46] verse 16 a little voice from heaven
[1:15:47] saying this is my beloved son in whom i
[1:15:50] am well pleased and that's what he says
[1:15:52] it's your new birth you have to come to
[1:15:54] a river jordan experience you have to
[1:15:55] come to a place where god says i'm
[1:15:57] pleased to dwell in that listen he said
[1:15:59] i'm pleased to dwell now
[1:16:01] i'm going to start building yeah yeah
[1:16:04] now i'm going to start building now i'm
[1:16:05] going to use you because remember
[1:16:07] justification is the work of the holy
[1:16:08] ghost but it's not putting you in
[1:16:10] service
[1:16:11] that's bob was saying the other night
[1:16:13] you know brother brown says to stand
[1:16:14] behind this sacred desk
[1:16:17] you need to have have an experience with
[1:16:19] god now you don't have to go out in the
[1:16:20] backside of the desert he meant like
[1:16:22] moses did
[1:16:23] but you got to have an experience yes
[1:16:26] like moses did
[1:16:30] because justification is a work of the
[1:16:31] holy spirit just chopping off your past
[1:16:33] sin sanctification god is going to let
[1:16:35] you do some things
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:40] right
[1:16:41] because it's set aside for service
[1:16:45] but when you get the holy ghost it puts
[1:16:46] you in service
[1:16:48] now see then you get all the full
[1:16:49] blessings sure in sanctification you get
[1:16:52] blessings too but listen you're not even
[1:16:53] bribed by that time
[1:16:57] sanctification doesn't put you
[1:17:00] in brideship
[1:17:02] it puts your name on the book as a
[1:17:03] believer it puts you in a religious
[1:17:05] order am i quoting the prophet it puts
[1:17:07] you it drives out the unclean spirit
[1:17:10] according to luke drives out the unclean
[1:17:12] spirit
[1:17:14] but when he fills you with something he
[1:17:16] seals that thing in
[1:17:18] and when he seals it in he can't get out
[1:17:21] and the devil can't get in
[1:17:23] now that's putting you in service
[1:17:25] that's washing the whole glass where you
[1:17:27] can fill it up and drink out of it amen
[1:17:30] so that's what that's what we see that
[1:17:32] many times people don't go on to the
[1:17:35] baptism of the holy ghost they get the
[1:17:36] sanctification they get it half time
[1:17:40] they get the half time of their
[1:17:41] religious game
[1:17:43] and they say well we're up 42 to nothing
[1:17:45] live we're fine
[1:17:47] no game ain't over you still got time on
[1:17:49] the clock
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:52] still gotta play the game
[1:17:56] listen folks this is not a game it's an
[1:17:58] example but this is not a game
[1:18:01] this is not a game that listen if you
[1:18:03] lose
[1:18:04] loser gets
[1:18:05] i ain't gonna say
[1:18:07] losers don't get a trophy like most they
[1:18:09] do now and end time everybody gets the
[1:18:10] trophy even if you just show up
[1:18:12] no
[1:18:13] listen folks not with god you don't get
[1:18:16] a trophy just for showing up
[1:18:19] you get a crown by being born again
[1:18:21] you get the blessings of god by being
[1:18:23] born again by giving your life to god
[1:18:25] totally and completely let him have the
[1:18:27] preeminence and see that's one thing we
[1:18:29] all need to work on because i know i'm
[1:18:31] standing here behind this behind this
[1:18:32] desk i don't give him all the
[1:18:34] preeminence
[1:18:35] that i should you don't either
[1:18:39] we're trying we're trying to get there
[1:18:42] we're moving
[1:18:44] but we're not there yet
[1:18:46] we're still but we're trying
[1:18:48] we're striving to let him have
[1:18:50] preeminence yes
[1:18:53] because jesus never got up one day
[1:18:56] he said i think i'll try to do what my
[1:18:58] daddy says today
[1:19:00] i'm going to try he says i do
[1:19:02] always do
[1:19:04] what my father tells me to do
[1:19:06] he was so in touch with that one inside
[1:19:08] of him until he knew
[1:19:10] what to do
[1:19:12] do me and you we're supposed to have the
[1:19:13] mind of christ we're supposed to have
[1:19:14] the holy ghost in our soul
[1:19:16] same person same man
[1:19:18] that's why we're talking about we'll
[1:19:19] talk about the characteristics maybe a
[1:19:21] little bit later on not in this
[1:19:22] this sermon
[1:19:24] but john 1 verse 32 says i saw the
[1:19:26] spirit descending from heaven like a
[1:19:27] dove
[1:19:29] and it abode upon him
[1:19:31] and i knew him not but he that sent me
[1:19:33] to baptize with water the same said to
[1:19:35] me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:19:37] descending and remain on him
[1:19:40] see we can have an anointing
[1:19:43] and it can go off of us
[1:19:46] but he says who you see the spirit
[1:19:47] descending and remaining
[1:19:50] on him the same as he which baptizes
[1:19:53] with the holy ghost you know i think
[1:19:54] god's let this thing go
[1:19:56] this long
[1:19:59] for us to prove who we are
[1:20:01] 60-something years and even after
[1:20:03] everybody said oh 1977 was going to be
[1:20:06] it 1977 we're way past 1977.
[1:20:10] we're 40-something years past that so
[1:20:12] why are we still here
[1:20:14] preeminence
[1:20:20] and we're not born again
[1:20:23] because when the last born-again person
[1:20:25] comes in the door shut yes
[1:20:28] so let's be sure
[1:20:30] this year let's make sure
[1:20:32] that we're sure
[1:20:34] that we're sure
[1:20:36] that you have the baptism of the holy
[1:20:37] ghost in your soul not just an anointing
[1:20:39] it's good to have anointings good for
[1:20:40] anointing to fall on us
[1:20:42] but boy go back and read anointed ones
[1:20:44] at the end time
[1:20:46] that one sermon probably rattled me more
[1:20:49] than any sermon has ever rattled me as
[1:20:50] well you see that how close that thing
[1:20:52] is
[1:20:54] but it took a profit to bring us that to
[1:20:56] what make us aware
[1:20:59] that there will be false christ now
[1:21:01] listen he didn't write a new page in the
[1:21:03] bible matthew 24 tells us they will come
[1:21:06] in the end time false teachers
[1:21:09] false christ false anointed ones
[1:21:13] you've got to figure out which one that
[1:21:14] is
[1:21:16] but remember the holy ghost will never
[1:21:18] fight against the holy ghost
[1:21:20] amen
[1:21:22] it'll never fight against each other now
[1:21:24] we might have qualms and and you know
[1:21:26] quirks and stuff of of humanity but when
[1:21:29] it comes down to the word of god
[1:21:31] there's only one
[1:21:33] and there's not any not an opinion
[1:21:36] remember what brother dale i always said
[1:21:38] if you come up to me and say i think i
[1:21:40] stop you right there
[1:21:42] or i thought
[1:21:44] no no we don't have a talk coming
[1:21:48] it's the word of god or nothing
[1:21:50] and this year i want us to see that
[1:21:53] all right so luke 4 verse 16. let's go
[1:21:55] to there
[1:21:56] abby and that's when he opened the book
[1:22:00] because see everything that jesus did
[1:22:05] was a was a symbol or an example of what
[1:22:07] we're supposed to do right
[1:22:09] all right hang with me just a few
[1:22:10] minutes don't go to sleep
[1:22:13] listen y'all hadn't even eat for a while
[1:22:16] and shouldn't be the carbs getting a
[1:22:17] hold of you
[1:22:19] hey man and you didn't get here until 10
[1:22:21] 30 or 11 o'clock so you should have
[1:22:22] slept an extra hour
[1:22:24] yes bob said yes
[1:22:29] because he's not sleeping
[1:22:31] but look
[1:22:33] so jesus goes into the end of the temple
[1:22:36] all right let's make this example jesus
[1:22:38] went into the temple
[1:22:40] as was look as was his custom
[1:22:45] jesus went to church
[1:22:47] as was his custom he went to the
[1:22:49] synagogue on the sabbath day and stood
[1:22:50] up for the read now why didn't they
[1:22:52] deliver him the old
[1:22:55] trusted
[1:22:58] pharisees sadducees whatever was in the
[1:23:01] church service why didn't they open the
[1:23:03] book
[1:23:04] and say here read what my denomination
[1:23:06] says
[1:23:10] or or read what my idea says
[1:23:13] no the bible says they handed it to him
[1:23:16] closed
[1:23:18] he chose to read that because look
[1:23:24] he found the place
[1:23:26] where it was written
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:29] he didn't just open it up and go
[1:23:32] oh i think i'll read this right here and
[1:23:33] all he found
[1:23:36] what pertained to him standing and i'm
[1:23:38] sure brother branham said that was the
[1:23:40] greatest anointing that ever struck the
[1:23:43] earth
[1:23:44] ever struck the earth not jumping up and
[1:23:46] shouting not running the walls or
[1:23:48] running the aisles he was sitting in the
[1:23:50] church standing
[1:23:52] in the church and he opened the book and
[1:23:54] identified who he was
[1:23:57] he found the place
[1:23:59] where it was written
[1:24:01] he found the place he was the word
[1:24:03] listen you got to find your place
[1:24:06] an open book you find your place
[1:24:09] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:24:17] because he has anointed me
[1:24:20] i'm not pointing at me i'm talking about
[1:24:21] jesus is saying he pointed me
[1:24:24] now that was written
[1:24:28] close to
[1:24:30] at least 2 000 years
[1:24:33] before jesus came on earth
[1:24:35] isaiah wrote that right
[1:24:38] and now he's fulfilling exactly
[1:24:41] what the scripture says
[1:24:43] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:24:44] because he hath appointed me to preach
[1:24:46] the gospel to the poor
[1:24:48] he hath sent me
[1:24:51] look at look at the identification he
[1:24:53] has sent me
[1:24:55] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:24:57] deliverance to the captives and recover
[1:24:59] of sight to the blind to set at liberty
[1:25:01] them that are bruised to preach the
[1:25:03] acceptable
[1:25:04] year of the lord
[1:25:06] he could have read the rest of that
[1:25:08] because remember the rest of that
[1:25:10] scripture
[1:25:11] is pertaining to his second coming and
[1:25:13] there's only a comma there it's not even
[1:25:15] a new it's not even a new paragraph or
[1:25:17] even a new scripture it's the same
[1:25:19] scripture he's reading he just stopped
[1:25:21] why because he was a word
[1:25:23] he knew where to start it and he knew
[1:25:25] where to stop it
[1:25:26] amen so what did he do
[1:25:28] he rolled it back up
[1:25:30] and handed it to the preacher
[1:25:33] and sat down and the eyes of all them
[1:25:35] were a synagogue were fastened upon him
[1:25:38] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:25:41] is this scripture
[1:25:43] fulfilled
[1:25:45] in your ears how many how many really
[1:25:47] realize that
[1:25:49] they didn't realize that but every time
[1:25:52] you come to a church service every time
[1:25:53] you do listen to the prophet's message
[1:25:55] every time you do listen to a sermon
[1:25:57] this day
[1:25:59] this scripture
[1:26:00] has been fulfilled in your ears
[1:26:02] hears faith cometh by hearing
[1:26:07] and hearing the word of god
[1:26:10] but really are we really listening
[1:26:14] are we really listening
[1:26:18] is it coming from here down to here
[1:26:22] because look this is where you think yes
[1:26:26] let me read you the bible
[1:26:28] as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:26:30] so is he
[1:26:34] this thing can get all muddled up this
[1:26:36] is where the greatest battles ever
[1:26:37] fought
[1:26:38] but listen if you're born again it ain't
[1:26:40] the battle down here
[1:26:41] it's the battle up here
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:44] but if you're born again
[1:26:46] remember it's sealed
[1:26:49] your filter is up here
[1:26:51] let it come down to here that's our
[1:26:52] problem we're not letting it come down
[1:26:56] but this day
[1:26:58] can you say that this day
[1:27:00] this scripture
[1:27:02] is fulfilled
[1:27:03] we know that that jesus talked to
[1:27:05] nicodemus and there was a conversation
[1:27:06] he told him said you must be born again
[1:27:09] you must be born from above
[1:27:11] you must be born not of
[1:27:13] yama again
[1:27:15] all right
[1:27:16] so now let's go to
[1:27:18] and that was
[1:27:19] uh jesus's first doctrine
[1:27:22] that should be our first doctrine what
[1:27:23] did brother bryan tell us he said i am
[1:27:26] i am certain i think what he said he
[1:27:27] said i am certain we're not getting them
[1:27:29] to christ
[1:27:30] we're getting them to a tradition
[1:27:32] we're getting them to where we can just
[1:27:34] say well you can do whatever you want to
[1:27:35] do you can you you're a christian
[1:27:37] no you can't do whatever you want to do
[1:27:40] and it's not do's and don'ts
[1:27:43] listen jim and i were talking coming up
[1:27:45] here
[1:27:47] today
[1:27:48] we were talking about buying a camper
[1:27:51] and take it to illinois
[1:27:53] and use it while we're up there so she
[1:27:55] can go with me and you know there's men
[1:27:57] that stays in the in the
[1:27:59] big place that we stay
[1:28:00] but i'd like for her to go
[1:28:03] she said well we won't be able to use it
[1:28:05] except maybe during the week
[1:28:08] you see where that mentality is
[1:28:11] we know what we're doing on the weekend
[1:28:15] we know we can't get in now listen if
[1:28:17] you want to take a camper and go out for
[1:28:18] a weekend that's fine but i'm talking
[1:28:20] about every weekend
[1:28:21] it's sunday
[1:28:23] i have a job
[1:28:25] and i love my job i want to be here
[1:28:30] i don't want to be sitting in a camper
[1:28:32] on sunday afternoon or sunday morning
[1:28:35] but see that's what i give up and you
[1:28:36] know what i don't give it up
[1:28:38] begrudgingly
[1:28:39] lord knows my heart i don't give it up
[1:28:41] and say well i can't buy that camper
[1:28:44] because we can't go off on the weekends
[1:28:45] because we got a goat chair
[1:28:48] now if you do that you're not a
[1:28:49] christian
[1:28:52] there's something pulling you more than
[1:28:54] god is pulling you if you buy a camper
[1:28:57] well there was a brother one time and
[1:28:59] i'm not gonna call his name a lot of you
[1:29:00] know who he is brother one time he got
[1:29:02] this idea i said idea he got this idea
[1:29:05] that if he would work on sunday he'd get
[1:29:07] paid triple time but he would give all
[1:29:09] that money to mission work
[1:29:15] and he said god gave him a job amen
[1:29:18] he lied
[1:29:20] god didn't give him a job
[1:29:22] now listen if you have to work on study
[1:29:23] to do different things but i'm talking
[1:29:24] about he said he was going to do it
[1:29:25] every sunday stayed out of church for
[1:29:27] two years
[1:29:29] but he sent that money to mission work
[1:29:30] well
[1:29:32] he wasn't very successful
[1:29:35] he's had problems ever since so you see
[1:29:38] what i mean your motive and objective
[1:29:41] if your motive is is to buy a camper so
[1:29:43] that you can go
[1:29:45] hunting and fishing on the weekend or
[1:29:47] camping on the weekend then you're wrong
[1:29:51] but you see the mentality that you
[1:29:53] should have
[1:29:55] see put god first
[1:29:58] then he'll make everything turn out
[1:30:00] right he'll make everything go the right
[1:30:02] way
[1:30:03] amen
[1:30:04] he'll have to because he said seek ye
[1:30:06] first the kingdom of heaven
[1:30:08] but see that's the mentality that we
[1:30:10] have versus the mentality of the world
[1:30:11] they say oh we bought a brand new camper
[1:30:13] i think we'll take it out and we'll i
[1:30:14] will be gone a couple of sundays it'd be
[1:30:16] okay a couple sundays a month it won't
[1:30:17] hurt anything
[1:30:26] what you saying brother wade if you do
[1:30:28] anything begrudgingly
[1:30:32] shame on you
[1:30:34] if you do anything begrudgingly if you
[1:30:36] say man i can't do that because i gotta
[1:30:38] go to church or i i sure would love to
[1:30:40] go
[1:30:41] i ain't gonna say walmart
[1:30:43] i hope nobody loves to go to walmart
[1:30:46] huh bass pro shop yeah thanks brother
[1:30:49] boyd
[1:30:50] i don't even go there anymore
[1:30:52] but if you're making an excuse to do
[1:30:54] something you and i don't know where
[1:30:55] this is going but i it's still okay our
[1:30:58] motive and objective
[1:31:00] as we come brother brown says as we come
[1:31:02] closer to the headstone
[1:31:04] our motive and objective should be more
[1:31:06] toward god than anything else i know
[1:31:09] listen you got families you got jobs you
[1:31:11] got things you ought to do but just to
[1:31:12] sit home because it's convenient to
[1:31:14] watch it on the internet
[1:31:18] just because it's convenient
[1:31:20] to watch it on the internet
[1:31:23] now if i have anything to do about it if
[1:31:24] you do anything like that you ain't get
[1:31:25] no silver dollar
[1:31:29] man
[1:31:31] just kidding
[1:31:33] but what was jesus's motive and
[1:31:35] objective
[1:31:37] to die to save your soul
[1:31:40] to preach three and a half years that's
[1:31:42] my whole point to preach he didn't come
[1:31:44] to say well he did one time say okay
[1:31:46] disciples we're a little tired
[1:31:49] let's go off and take a vacation for a
[1:31:50] little while remember that's in the
[1:31:51] bible let's go away for a little while
[1:31:53] and that's okay because he was a human
[1:31:54] being that's what i told luis i said you
[1:31:56] need to take some time off you're still
[1:31:57] a human being you're going to wear your
[1:31:59] body down and the devil's going to jump
[1:32:01] on you
[1:32:02] so he's he's looking good now he's walk
[1:32:05] you see that one where he walked like
[1:32:06] five miles up this mountain road i mean
[1:32:08] he was sweating just a little bit and he
[1:32:11] said i'm glad the kids didn't come
[1:32:13] yeah he'd be carrying him that's what he
[1:32:14] was he'd be taking he'd be taking zoey
[1:32:16] and
[1:32:17] carrying her up that mountain but he's
[1:32:18] doing a good job
[1:32:20] god will bless him because he put god
[1:32:22] first
[1:32:23] so you put god first in everything kids
[1:32:25] everything
[1:32:27] everything you do you put god first
[1:32:30] because you know what that's what jesus
[1:32:32] did
[1:32:33] even though he was god almighty and
[1:32:34] human flesh he put god first
[1:32:37] i do nothing
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:39] but what the father tells me to do now
[1:32:41] listen
[1:32:42] he didn't have this voice telling him to
[1:32:44] get up like a alarm clock get get up get
[1:32:47] up at seven o'clock in the morning
[1:32:50] eat your wheaties
[1:32:53] no
[1:32:54] it's the pertinent things in life the
[1:32:56] things he was saying the things he was
[1:32:57] speaking the words he was saying were
[1:33:00] what'd he say my words
[1:33:03] are life
[1:33:05] wow
[1:33:07] wow and then paul steps up
[1:33:09] after jesus is gone and come back into
[1:33:11] into paul paul stands up one day and
[1:33:14] says you're going to be judged by what i
[1:33:16] say
[1:33:16] if an angel from heaven
[1:33:19] comes and brings any other gospel
[1:33:22] any other than what i've spoken to you
[1:33:25] let it be accursed
[1:33:26] and he said it twice
[1:33:28] just to make sure we understood that god
[1:33:30] was speaking through paul
[1:33:32] oh well that's great that was paul we
[1:33:34] talk about william brown what about me
[1:33:35] and you
[1:33:37] what about me and you if god's anointed
[1:33:38] us to speak the word of god that's god
[1:33:40] talking to you
[1:33:42] amen
[1:33:46] and we should stay behind this sacred
[1:33:47] desk i only say what the father tells me
[1:33:49] to say
[1:33:51] now anywhere else
[1:33:54] we're human
[1:33:55] we're way more human than than jesus was
[1:33:58] amen
[1:33:59] because we have a spirit that's a little
[1:34:01] bit you know his spirit could be his
[1:34:04] spirit could be um talked to
[1:34:07] but satan couldn't get a hold of him
[1:34:10] because he was born he was not born with
[1:34:12] a carnal mind you and i are so what i'm
[1:34:14] saying is we don't need to be we can't
[1:34:16] be you know god zombies
[1:34:18] no but we must
[1:34:20] put him first in everything
[1:34:22] put him first in everything because
[1:34:24] jesus put god first in everything listen
[1:34:27] he could have done a lot of things
[1:34:29] listen he could have risen up for the
[1:34:31] for the signs and wonders that he did
[1:34:36] he was well known
[1:34:38] brother branham
[1:34:40] 50 000 people
[1:34:42] in a service couldn't get them under a
[1:34:43] tent
[1:34:45] because of the healing campaign because
[1:34:47] of the healing part but when he started
[1:34:49] saying i and my father are one
[1:34:52] when jesus said if you've seen me you've
[1:34:54] seen the father
[1:34:55] he got a little closer he said unless
[1:34:56] you eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:34:58] you'll have no part with me
[1:35:00] what happened
[1:35:02] it was like they pulled the drain plug
[1:35:03] out of the human
[1:35:06] bowl
[1:35:08] they left him
[1:35:10] there was only 12 left and he turned
[1:35:12] around one day and said you're going to
[1:35:13] leave too
[1:35:15] right
[1:35:16] are you going to leave too
[1:35:19] you've got to eat my flesh and drink my
[1:35:21] blood
[1:35:22] or you'll have no bite with me
[1:35:25] we know what he was talking about
[1:35:28] but remember some walked away and never
[1:35:31] walked with him again
[1:35:35] turned god down
[1:35:37] because they didn't understand what he
[1:35:38] was saying
[1:35:39] can that happen to us do we turn god
[1:35:42] down because we don't understand what
[1:35:44] he's saying
[1:35:45] let's don't turn him down let's just say
[1:35:46] god help me understand what that man's
[1:35:48] saying help me understand what brother
[1:35:50] dale said help me understand what
[1:35:51] brother bob said help me understand
[1:35:54] what's going on because you promised me
[1:35:57] you would do that
[1:35:59] you promised me you would take care of
[1:36:00] me if i'd put you first
[1:36:04] so put him first and then what act on it
[1:36:07] say god
[1:36:08] i'm putting you first
[1:36:13] so now let's go to matthew 17 verse 8
[1:36:15] and then we'll be finished right here
[1:36:16] musicians get ready
[1:36:17] we haven't talked much about the
[1:36:18] headstone but we've been talking about
[1:36:20] in the whole service
[1:36:24] matthew 17 verse 8
[1:36:26] when they had lifted up their eyes they
[1:36:27] saw no man say jesus only thank goodness
[1:36:30] as they came down from the mountain
[1:36:32] jesus charged him saying tell the vision
[1:36:33] to no man
[1:36:35] until the son of man be risen again from
[1:36:38] the dead
[1:36:40] now six months later he was the son of
[1:36:41] man standing there was going to die but
[1:36:43] he said risen again from the dead
[1:36:46] somebody killed him
[1:36:49] they didn't kill him physically he only
[1:36:50] died physically one time but you can
[1:36:52] kill they killed him spiritually down
[1:36:54] through the church ages
[1:36:55] his disciples they're saying when then
[1:36:57] say the scribes that are lost must first
[1:36:59] come
[1:37:01] right
[1:37:02] and jesus answered and said unto them
[1:37:03] elish truly shall first come and restore
[1:37:07] all things that's our promise of malachi
[1:37:09] 4.
[1:37:10] john the baptist did not restore all
[1:37:13] things
[1:37:14] he just introduced the head
[1:37:17] right he did not restore them back to
[1:37:19] the headstone
[1:37:21] he introduced the headstone and then
[1:37:23] what did man do man cut him off yes
[1:37:27] man right
[1:37:28] because let's look in psalms 118 verse
[1:37:30] 21
[1:37:32] it says i will praise thee for those for
[1:37:34] thou has heard me and art become my
[1:37:36] salvation
[1:37:37] the stone which the builders refused is
[1:37:39] become the headstone
[1:37:41] of the corner
[1:37:43] this is the lord's doing it is marvelous
[1:37:45] in our eyes
[1:37:46] look in ephesians 2 verse 19
[1:37:49] it says now therefore ye are no more
[1:37:50] strangers than foreigners but fellow
[1:37:52] citizens with the saints and of the
[1:37:54] household of god and are built upon the
[1:37:56] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[1:38:00] you got to be built on the foundation of
[1:38:02] apostles and
[1:38:04] prophets
[1:38:07] wow
[1:38:08] jesus christ though himself being the
[1:38:10] chief cornerstone
[1:38:12] because he remember the headstone was
[1:38:13] rejected
[1:38:15] the headstone right here was rejected
[1:38:18] so it's not there
[1:38:20] but he became the chief cornerstone
[1:38:22] the foundation
[1:38:24] oh zerubbabel
[1:38:27] what a great mountain is going to be
[1:38:28] built but you got to start at the bottom
[1:38:30] crying grace grace
[1:38:32] unto it
[1:38:36] so he took him they didn't do away with
[1:38:37] him folks he just hid himself down here
[1:38:40] in the church ages
[1:38:41] he hit himself with a as the cornerstone
[1:38:44] because remember the cornerstone makes
[1:38:46] everything square
[1:38:47] if that cornerstone's out of out of
[1:38:49] alignment you're not square
[1:38:51] and man but that thing had to be that's
[1:38:53] why brother brown said anybody can build
[1:38:55] a straight wall
[1:38:56] he said it takes a profit
[1:38:59] or a master skilled builder to turn that
[1:39:01] corner and start a new wall
[1:39:04] amen and that's what we had as aruba
[1:39:07] yes
[1:39:07] to not make a new foundation listen this
[1:39:09] is our foundation
[1:39:14] and what was built on top of that
[1:39:16] matched the foundation
[1:39:19] all right let's read this and then we'll
[1:39:20] then we'll close and we'll bring this
[1:39:22] out again later
[1:39:23] built upon the
[1:39:24] foundation of the possible process jesus
[1:39:26] christ being the chief cornerstone look
[1:39:27] in whom all the buildings fitly framed
[1:39:29] together that's me and you
[1:39:32] groweth
[1:39:33] unto a holy temple in the lord
[1:39:35] in whom you also are building together
[1:39:37] for inhabitation
[1:39:39] of god
[1:39:42] have you ever asked god
[1:39:45] god inhabit this
[1:39:47] i know it's thinking it's filthy it's
[1:39:49] rotten it has bad thoughts but could you
[1:39:52] just inhabit this vessel yes
[1:39:55] i can ask that for y'all but you got to
[1:39:57] ask it for yourself
[1:39:59] god would you inhabit this you know what
[1:40:00] he's going to do he's going to say okay
[1:40:02] you need to clean it up a little bit
[1:40:04] because i won't dwell in an unclean
[1:40:05] vessel according to my word amen
[1:40:09] so i said all this um
[1:40:11] talk about this you know this seed being
[1:40:13] in us
[1:40:14] you can say whatever you want to
[1:40:16] you were born in sin
[1:40:18] your soul was black
[1:40:21] because you can't change the bible
[1:40:24] i know what brother brown is bringing
[1:40:25] out we have representation from god we
[1:40:27] know that
[1:40:28] our representation was the seed word of
[1:40:31] god not a seed that was put inside of
[1:40:33] you to make you different
[1:40:34] no god god's not a respecter of persons
[1:40:38] he's not going to dwell in an unclean
[1:40:39] vessel and i was unclean until god saved
[1:40:43] my soul
[1:40:44] so were you
[1:40:46] everybody was
[1:40:48] first peter 2 verse 5 says ye also as
[1:40:51] lively
[1:40:52] stones
[1:40:53] or built up a spiritual house a holy
[1:40:55] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:40:56] sacrifices acceptable god by jesus
[1:40:58] christ
[1:40:59] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:41:01] scripture behold i lay in zion
[1:41:03] a chief cornerstone elect precious
[1:41:06] and he that believeth on him shall not
[1:41:08] be
[1:41:08] what
[1:41:10] confounded
[1:41:12] jesus when he was on earth he confounded
[1:41:15] the scholars
[1:41:17] when the prophet of god came on the
[1:41:19] earth and started preaching the pure
[1:41:20] message of god it confounded the
[1:41:23] scholarly people of the world amen amen
[1:41:27] so guess what
[1:41:29] we have to do the same thing we have to
[1:41:32] confound people can't understand why we
[1:41:34] live the way we live but like i said
[1:41:35] before it's not a have to if you think
[1:41:37] you have to do this
[1:41:40] you're wrong
[1:41:42] you're wrong
[1:41:44] it's like june always said you know
[1:41:46] her family said she's been brainwashed i
[1:41:48] said hallelujah
[1:41:51] hallelujah all of us need that i don't
[1:41:53] want to remember what i did in the past
[1:41:55] brainwashed means you wipe everything
[1:41:56] off by the new birth it's been wiped off
[1:42:00] you have been brainwashed amen
[1:42:02] and then washed by the water of the word
[1:42:05] and then he puts his mind in
[1:42:07] but they said why do you not cut your
[1:42:09] hair it looks like it and see everybody
[1:42:10] goes to that they go oh you look so
[1:42:12] miserable i may have told you that it
[1:42:14] looks y'all look so miserable
[1:42:16] you ain't got no makeup you know and you
[1:42:18] can't do this
[1:42:20] because you got your face all painted up
[1:42:22] like this
[1:42:23] to make it look like something ain't and
[1:42:26] and like brother brown said i hate
[1:42:30] listen i'm telling you i'm being honest
[1:42:32] you look at some people out in the world
[1:42:34] and you go
[1:42:36] yeah thanks sister then you go
[1:42:41] without all that what would that look
[1:42:42] like
[1:42:44] but i like natural beauty
[1:42:48] men and women in this church i'm telling
[1:42:50] you you're naturally beautiful you're
[1:42:51] just beautiful to god you're beautiful
[1:42:53] to brother dale
[1:42:55] he's espoused us to jesus christ and
[1:42:57] listen i don't think brother dale's
[1:42:59] ashamed of presenting us to god
[1:43:02] i think he's done a good job to get us
[1:43:04] to a place to where we can be
[1:43:06] presentable to god
[1:43:09] which is your reasonable service what's
[1:43:11] the bible i'll read it to you next
[1:43:12] sunday that's your reasonable service
[1:43:14] it's to present yourself a sacrifice
[1:43:17] it is and listen it is a sacrifice
[1:43:20] but you know what i thank god i don't
[1:43:22] have to walk into in the bathroom in the
[1:43:24] morning and go who is that
[1:43:27] where she puts all that stuff on
[1:43:30] and you don't have to spend thousands of
[1:43:32] dollars
[1:43:33] on max factor and all that stuff
[1:43:35] thank goodness buy hunting clothes with
[1:43:37] it or something you know
[1:43:39] but but june yeah
[1:43:41] well i wasn't gonna say pans or pots
[1:43:43] because you wouldn't like that either so
[1:43:44] but you got to cook
[1:43:46] but jim's family says oh you must be so
[1:43:48] sad
[1:43:50] having to do what you do
[1:43:53] have to
[1:43:54] jim told him one time she said let me
[1:43:56] tell you something
[1:43:57] she said if jesus christ could hang on a
[1:43:59] cross
[1:44:00] for three hours
[1:44:03] with nails in his hand and his feet
[1:44:05] beat like hamburger meat they didn't
[1:44:07] just barely put that crown on top of his
[1:44:09] head folks they probably pounded it on
[1:44:11] his head with some leather
[1:44:13] they beat him with a catalan tails to
[1:44:15] where his ribs show
[1:44:17] and then after he got all that they
[1:44:19] stuck a spear in his side
[1:44:21] jim said if he can do that for me
[1:44:26] me having to
[1:44:27] do my hair
[1:44:30] and have this
[1:44:31] shameful face
[1:44:33] she said that's nothing compared to what
[1:44:34] he did for me
[1:44:36] she said it's just part of what i want
[1:44:37] to give back to him
[1:44:39] that i want to be what a sacrifice
[1:44:43] which is your reasonable service
[1:44:46] see if we live that way and think of it
[1:44:48] as not a burden
[1:44:50] you get god in your soul it'll never be
[1:44:52] a burden
[1:44:53] because you know what you're doing what
[1:44:54] the word says
[1:44:56] see there can't be a conflict there they
[1:44:58] can be a conflict when one of them's not
[1:45:00] the word and one is the word
[1:45:01] but you can't be a conflict when the
[1:45:03] word talks to the word
[1:45:04] like i said when jesus talked to the
[1:45:06] father and talked to the one inside of
[1:45:07] him there was no conflict
[1:45:09] nowhere in the bible he said well i
[1:45:11] don't know if i won't do that or not
[1:45:13] no he said i always do that what the
[1:45:14] father said even when he was it when he
[1:45:16] was at gethsemane he said father if it
[1:45:18] be possible
[1:45:20] let it pass for me but he knew it wasn't
[1:45:22] possible
[1:45:23] he knew what he'd have to do he said but
[1:45:25] nevertheless thy will be done
[1:45:28] magicians get ready to come behold i lay
[1:45:30] in zion a chief cornerstone elect
[1:45:32] precious and he that believeth on him
[1:45:34] shall not be confounded unto you
[1:45:36] therefore which believe he is precious
[1:45:39] but unto them which be disobedient the
[1:45:41] stone which the builders disallowed the
[1:45:43] same has made the head of the corner now
[1:45:45] watch a stone of stumbling
[1:45:48] jesus was a stumbling stone to people
[1:45:50] when he was on earth
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:52] a rock of offense
[1:45:55] even to them which stumble at the word
[1:45:59] that's the stumbling part they stumble
[1:46:00] at the word of god
[1:46:02] being disobedient
[1:46:05] where unto also
[1:46:07] they were appointed some people are
[1:46:09] appointed to disobedience
[1:46:12] that's why the word's there
[1:46:14] is to keep us obedient
[1:46:16] musicians come on
[1:46:19] that word's there to keep us obedient
[1:46:20] and yeah sometimes we are sheep and go
[1:46:23] astray
[1:46:24] as brother michael was saying i love
[1:46:25] that song
[1:46:28] sometimes we do go astray but you know
[1:46:29] what the chief shepherd goes and gets us
[1:46:32] and he may have to break our leg every
[1:46:34] once in a while to keep us from running
[1:46:35] off again
[1:46:36] amen we may have to go through trials
[1:46:38] and tribulations and all the different
[1:46:39] things that that but you know what
[1:46:42] if you're a believer if you're a
[1:46:44] christian
[1:46:45] you got to go back to the bible that
[1:46:46] says
[1:46:47] i'll not put on any more than you can
[1:46:49] take and boy we think we get right up to
[1:46:51] the edge of it too but he said i'll
[1:46:53] never put no more on you than you can
[1:46:55] take
[1:46:56] sister jeff norma jefferies asked me one
[1:46:58] time you know her husband died pretty
[1:47:00] young brother junior
[1:47:02] we were at the funeral home and she said
[1:47:03] bro wait why'd god do this to me
[1:47:06] i said well i don't know that god did
[1:47:07] that to you sister noma i said but you
[1:47:09] know what
[1:47:10] i said god knew you could handle it
[1:47:14] if you're a child of god god knew you
[1:47:15] could handle it sister jim may not
[1:47:17] handle it if i passed away i mean really
[1:47:19] understand what i'm saying
[1:47:21] he knew you could handle it
[1:47:24] but it was time for that person to go
[1:47:26] but he knew you could handle it and look
[1:47:28] at sister norma now she's got grandkids
[1:47:30] all over the place she's just as you
[1:47:32] know just as sweet as she can be so
[1:47:34] so it's just things that happen in life
[1:47:36] and we just have to accept what god got
[1:47:37] for us and accept that it was for our
[1:47:39] goodness
[1:47:42] sometimes a little chastening you know
[1:47:44] to get us back in line that's what we
[1:47:46] need so let's stand our feet
[1:47:48] god bless you we love you with the love
[1:47:49] of the lord
[1:47:51] just think about what jesus did
[1:47:54] he sat there that day and he said this
[1:47:55] day
[1:47:56] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears

[1:55:28] sure
[1:55:38] yeah right there
[1:55:40] hey man um i just want to give this
[1:55:42] quick testimony and um also shine the
[1:55:44] light on how the brother was bringing
[1:55:46] out how beautiful you sisters are
[1:55:49] and and men too in a manly way
[1:55:51] but it is so refreshing um just coming
[1:55:54] out of the world you said that right
[1:55:57] you're good just coming out of the world
[1:55:59] you know like i was a vessel of dishonor
[1:56:01] for a long time you know i i went out on
[1:56:03] god and
[1:56:04] manchester turned my back on him in so
[1:56:06] many different ways i don't even deserve
[1:56:08] to be here right now standing right here
[1:56:09] i feel unworthy
[1:56:10] right but um
[1:56:12] i remember even being out there and i
[1:56:14] used to wear makeup a lot
[1:56:16] not like it is today where it's packed
[1:56:18] on like cake on top of cake and cake but
[1:56:21] i used to wear it and i was a slave to
[1:56:23] it
[1:56:24] and
[1:56:25] without it i
[1:56:26] felt i didn't like who i was without it
[1:56:29] so the devil got a way of putting it on
[1:56:31] you where you feel right brother you
[1:56:32] don't feel good without it because
[1:56:34] that's his way of doing it but anyway
[1:56:36] i feel i feel so free to not wear it and
[1:56:40] you sisters are so beautiful when i got
[1:56:41] here it was like man
[1:56:43] they you guys are so beautiful that's
[1:56:45] right yes and
[1:56:47] even the men out there appreciate you
[1:56:48] guys whether you know it or not i don't
[1:56:50] know about the ones that are trapped
[1:56:51] into this beauty but it's men that
[1:56:53] actually
[1:56:54] appreciate women for being natural right
[1:56:56] you know yeah and every now and then and
[1:56:59] you guys probably experience it too
[1:57:01] you have a man just come up to you
[1:57:02] naturally and say you're so beautiful
[1:57:04] and you can tell if they mean it from a
[1:57:06] uh perverted way or not you can tell
[1:57:09] right but some men really appreciate you
[1:57:10] for being beautiful plains because they
[1:57:12] really are sick of it
[1:57:14] they're sick of it you know it's kind of
[1:57:16] like um
[1:57:17] you you see women with these tight pants
[1:57:19] on and you're almost sick of it because
[1:57:20] everybody got them on from young to old
[1:57:22] from babies to older women you know
[1:57:24] you're sick of it but um i'm saying that
[1:57:26] to say this um
[1:57:28] i have a customer
[1:57:30] that i go to maybe twice a week
[1:57:33] and i have to be in this house to do the
[1:57:35] job that i do i do cleaning
[1:57:37] so um
[1:57:38] he's a very nice guy and everything but
[1:57:41] every now and then he would um it'll
[1:57:43] roll off his tongue like um beautiful
[1:57:45] he'll say that more than my name like
[1:57:46] you know um hey beautiful or hey
[1:57:48] beautiful this beautiful that so i kind
[1:57:50] of got it wasn't bothering me at first
[1:57:52] but it started to bother me after a
[1:57:53] while like man i got to correct this guy
[1:57:54] and then get him to call me by my name
[1:57:56] you know there you go so um
[1:57:58] i worked myself up and um
[1:58:00] i sent out a voicemail i didn't send it
[1:58:02] to him but i recorded my voicemail
[1:58:04] and um i was thinking about how i'm
[1:58:06] going to say it how i'm going to
[1:58:07] approach it how am i going to say it and
[1:58:09] um i recorded it and stopped it and said
[1:58:11] let me say it this way let me put it
[1:58:12] that way right now i'm going through all
[1:58:13] this
[1:58:14] so um i was like man okay the next time

[1:58:18] with him just let him know i'd rather
[1:58:19] him use my name um
[1:58:21] so anyway um
