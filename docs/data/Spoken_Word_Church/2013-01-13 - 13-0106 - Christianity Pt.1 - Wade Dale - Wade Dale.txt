========================================

get another server but everything they got they lost so they're gonna have to pull it out literally we have it back up here so just pray that that will all come together so that's not all you know the heat right yeah we got no heat upstairs but i mean we got heat daddy came up here six o'clock this morning turned up electric fans on so if you get hot deal with it you get cold deal with it well the other thing with this web server is all the brothers that work on it have full-time jobs actually you don't know what you're talking about 68 degrees is what it's set on always it never gets below 68. i have seen it below seasick i'm telling you i haven't seen everything i guess must be blind because it never has been on sick all right let's go we're going to we have had i've had three people turn in suggestions and jim made a suggestion last night right before we went to bed so i guess the rest of you don't care what we do because i asked you to do it a couple weeks ago um but brother ray sent one to me which is really i want to read this to you and then i want to show you what the other person gave me and then what the other person gave me and then what i've been kind of jim kind of uh don't know it but she kind of put the punctuation part on it last night so um because beyond popular beliefs you know i don't discuss much about the what i'm preaching or what i'm studying or anything like that so you kind of want to keep the keep your mind open you know for for what the lord wants you to do but brother ray sent me one from healing and what sickness is in 1950 it says now there may be things this is brother brown that god has added to the church which stimulate faith but now when i'm gone healing isn't gone healing ought to be more than it was before we come here see see that's the purpose is to get the people in their mind in the spirit of the latter days we're in the latter day you believe that we are the world is in the spirit of the latter days but the church is not in the latter day spirit yet right see in other words we may be in a portion but god wants his church so in the spirit till they'll just fit the just anywhere god were to lead them to the latter days are rending of the world my my look at the places eating drinking marrying giving in marriage and all the immoral there is in the world the devil sent down his troops in the latter-day spirit which is allowed to see them and we may discuss that a little bit but we ministers haven't got the church yet in that spirit and we must be in that condition in order to be caught away in the rapture when he comes back that's right okay so brother brother uh ray's point was how to get the church and the latter-day spirit right right and then sister regina sent me one that says maybe we can do a focus on the bride and the end time or is it time to revisit the statue of a perfect man one level at a time okay and then sister johnny 35 question show why every purpose this is the first one now i didn't tell her what order to put these in but if you're if you're a little bit spiritual you're going to see all these fit together show why every purpose and redemption from the fall of man to the day of pentecost centers in the new birth and then after that it's just all kind of other things but the very first one was that and then jim kind of was talking about last night and it wasn't exactly what she said but what i've been thinking about doing is is doing a series on the new birth aside from this message well this message is not the new birth right luther was born again under luther's age and he didn't know anything about seals plagues violence wool trumpets etc i didn't say it you understand when i say you didn't know anything about it he knew a partial remember brother brown said right here this is a good quote i like this quote i'm going to keep it i keep it in my bible now but he says we're in the latter days you believe that the church is not in the latter day spirit yet in other words we may be in a portion all right but it's the portion for our day but we're in the last day what's latter day mean last we're in the last day all right so if we don't act like christians forget about the message that's right all right we don't like christians forget about the messenger but i think we've just kind of started and i'll be honest we see people even in this church you just walk into church and just start coming to church that's head knowledge right that's right that's head knowledge brother brown said you ought to be able to read that about the fall and read about the water baptism that's just the ability to read the devil puts this message together but the devil can't live he either lives a devil life or you either live a devil life or a god life no gray area sure we have this guy to deal with which deals and where i think that's what we'll do but see that's the part of what regina was saying about the statue of a perfect man or the bride at the end time well we got to start know what the characteristics of the bride in the beginning was my sister johnny said the new birth on the day of pentecost what did it do to those people it didn't bring them into our message sure our message is important but brother brown said you could take a an egg and land under a a dog right environment and it'll birth it'll be birth but now here's my point and i'll try to make that point all through the through the year that we that we stay on this is that i believe you can be born again outside of hearing of this message hold on but once you do the message you will become the message you can't be born again in this age and not because see luther you can't be born again in luther's age and not be under luther's but see you've got to remember too let's go back up and let's say we'll see because remember this is not going to be it's not be cut and dry because you had people coming out of paul's day overlapping in the irenaeus's day some of irenas's teachings was paul's of course but paul had his own converts that may have lapped over into irenaeus's age everybody understand that same way with pentecost because brother brown calls pentecost faults in certain places but he's talking about the denomination pentecost as far as all right the denomination pentecost is false but now the people in there weren't faults to a degree because look at brother bondsworth he toured with brother brown for about 18 years before he died 18 years and he never accepted the message but brother brown called him the old oak tree gonna be there he said brother brown said under his teaching because he was back from that pentecostal age he never come into the be the true light of lord jesus christ baptism but yet god winked at that ignorance but now we have to pay attention now that as we come through this i want you to realize something when we do get to the epitome or the apex of what god wants yes it is separate from anything else it is separate from denomination it is separate from this it is separate from that but but it's not that you're it's not that because you believe the message you're automatically born again no you've got to get born again then the message becomes alive that's right the bible says the letter killeth and that's what's happening to a lot of people the letter's killing you and you don't know it you're sitting right here in the church and you but your life's going to prove it somewhere that's right and i would to god like daddy said i would god and everybody would realize that hey i got what i thought i had yes that's right then we can start because once we go up through here up to the statue of a perfect man you will not be able to understand the things of god without having god inside of him okay so that's how we're going to approach this i was thinking of going one way or the other but when jim said that last night i thought well and then sister johnny brought me this i thought well maybe god this is the way you want to do because i was talking to myself the other day about what brother ray had said how to approach that to getting a latter day spirit well to get in the latter day spirit you got to have a fear you either got the latter day spirit of laodicea or you've got the latter-day spirit of the new birth which is not different than the new birth they had on the day of pentecost and not different than luther's or wesley and all that god's always the same that's right he always has his basic foundation then he grows from that or he raises you up actually from that foundation right just like the statue of a perfect man no one taught the statue of a perfect man even peter would stand up and say add to your faith knowledge and all this temper patience peace and godliness but those people that was a prophecy for me and you there's certain things in the scripture and like what some of the things that sister johnny and like virginia here maybe you can do a focus on the bride at the end time well we got to see what a bride does and how a bride acts first there's going to be billions of people in heaven that's never heard of william brown because they did one thing we're going to read it turn to john 3. and this thing's not starting so i don't know what i don't know what the deal is not recording so that will anyway all right it's going to be important we're going to um i'm going to be gone on the 27th of january lord william going to brother pinkston for a couple days so the bob will take over for that weekend so but we're going to really drive this thing home and and make a commitment or i am that i'm going to find out if i got really got what i think i got and the only way you can do it is is by the word right not reading a message book now listen i want y'all to get this thing we're not kicking the message out i hope you know that right this message is totally the most important thing outside of this right outside of getting born again the message you've got to hear it you've got to listen to what brother because that is god speaking to you what he's doing is is he he sent a messenger to take all these mysteries that's in the bible and say here you're my bride i'm the only one you're you're the only one i'm going to talk to about these things right here does everybody understand that we're going to take it slow these are the only things i'm going to show you these right here but now paul didn't need it that's right arenas didn't need it martin luther columba the reason we need it is just like what brother brown said and we'll read some quotes next sunday because i really didn't know which way to go so i didn't bring any quotes but i'll bring up some quotes next sunday is brother brown said what would the messenger of malachi 4 do two things right bring the people out and turn them back to the faith of the fathers all right because we got to realize that peter james and john and all those early church members they had this but it was never put together in a forum to where brother brown and that's what one of my comments was at the minister's meeting the other day everybody's going well brother brown's chart was wrong or they weren't saying that but you knew that's what they were saying this chart we got to quit leaning so much to charts well what about that one right right what about the statue of a perfect man where the angel actually drew the chart on the wall the same chart that they that he had drunk strong so i i believe in brother brown's charge i don't want nobody else's chart i don't know why it's drawing me a chart we're going to use the chart that william brown grew all right because once the brother says well this is well what if we study the hebrew series and we make a chart i said well that's us making the chart i said but brother brown will do the charcoal statue for the statue of perfect man he drew the he drew the one for daniel 70 weeks we're not trying to make this any different i said y'all are the ones trying to make this different right same way with that right there paul irenaeus and all those first church members they never had this drawn as a way to get up so that the headstone could come down so i'm trying to make a basis here we are heading toward the headstone but that headstone never came on the church in any other age except this age that's right so they weren't required to break down all the church age messengers irenaeus probably did not god probably did not reveal to him hey you're the second angel because it wasn't important at that time irenaeus knew that he had heard from god right iranians knew he had a message from god but he took brother branham to pull all that out right and say all right after your faith virtue well we're going to do a little chart here we're going to put all the messengers in because there's seven stars there's seven church ages that we have to go through all right but there's going to be billions of people yes i want you to get that in your mind billions of people that's not going to ever hear william branham that's going to be born again christians just as eternal as you are living in the city called bride what i thought long time ago brother branham come to put all this together because no other age that their soul was eternal but nobody nobody that jesus christ body and spirit has been eternal so that's why he had i see that's why he had to come put it all together to get our body and spirit uh made eternal because no other age that's why he had the ministry of the son of man the son of man was never spoken of except for a few times in the new testament the old testament in ezekiel said son of man prophesy son of man do this well that was god in human flesh talking to the people through a prophet but it was more of the prophet speaking to the people and the people never came to that position now it's not just brother dale's got to come to that position he's got to bring a group of people to that position that's right so it's not just a one-man show it's a it's a whole unit of a bride has got to be brought up because there's no other age we can't just say well there's another age coming we'll just live and die and there's another prophet going to raise up and he'll tell us how to do it no this is it that's why the scriptures now are not prophecy anymore they're reality that's right paul prophesied we which are alive and remain well he's dead he's not a weed no more that's right now we are we which are alive and remain and they could have said it in any other age but there's no other age to hand it to that's right but remember all the prophets wanted to see this day you know why this is what i believe the prophets knew they only saw a little portion of god okay but we see the fullness yes if you don't get the fullness of god we can't bring him back here and that's the problem to get the fullness of god though we ought to be born again first we can't be imitators that's right we can't be halfways we can't be part of the time okay we got to be christian first and foremost we got to be christian then we worry about seals and plagues and vials and you know and i'm just going to make this statement to all you and you can go back and tell everybody else in this church a lot of us me included we do a lot of studying and in our human listen in our human mortal mind we're looking for something that somebody else don't know that's right if you're honest with yourself you're looking for something else so you can have this little edge over somebody else that don't know anything that's wrong that's true that's wrong the bible says study to show yourself approved not approve yourself to somebody else so you're self-approved right okay that's right so and i'm i'm i'm guilty of it i'm telling you i'm guilty of we always got well we got this little ace card that we can that or we get to we get to spend a lot of time with brother dale you know and and the reason i don't spend a lot of time with my dad you know why because i don't want to influence the things he says i want him to come out and preach the word of god and let it be pure and let it hit me just as long as it hits everybody else right i swear i don't it's because you can do that you can influence a preacher we can all get to studying on one thing and we can influence what he says that's right right so the best thing to do is let's be christian first that's right then what he says will be quicken to us okay okay because i mean honestly quit doing that quit trying to be a preacher be a christian let god talk to you in your everyday life in your everyday ways and your every day of doing things let god have control of your life so that because remember all the sermons he preaches if you go out and live like the devil or you go out and somebody sees you do something that destroys everything he preached i don't care if it's headstone preaching that destroys it it's destroyed because we're going to read it in a little while it's the foundation that you build on but if the foundation is wrong then you're going to be wrong i don't care because brother brown said you have some of these virtues you're not going to be born again right right so what's the key be born again then those virtues can work the way god because remember power without character satanic and that's what our problem is sometimes we get so much head knowledge and we think we because we come to this church i'm speaking for everybody because we come to this church and we hear the word up here this high that we're automatically right here no brother dale's live everyday life at general motors had more influence on those people down there than any sermon he ever preached really you can ask every one of them philadelphia tom well tom but i know he said that it was the life that brother dale lived in front of him they knew that he was a christian so once they have confidence that you're a christian then you can have confidence in what the man says okay so we're going to approach that as as to that we're not going to say a lot of what brother brown says we're going to just stay with the bible now i'm going to bring a few quotes to get us started up the ladder all right but it's kind of like um i don't know who i was talking to this past weekend we had so much company but uh it's it's it behooves us to do better this year yes if you don't you need the new burger but we all need to refill it that's right we all need to say hey i need to it's like well it's my brother jason was talking wednesday a month monday night repent means turn around go the other direction not continue on the same path you're on repent means turn and going another direction so if you're doing something here turn around and go in another direction because remember the bible says at the end time iniquity will abound now what's iniquity that's knowing to do better and don't do it or knowing that you're doing something that you shouldn't do that's right that's iniquity that's right and if iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold exactly what is the end time spirit okay that end time spirit that he's talking about is the message of the hour okay because you can't take a change of the body without this message but you can take a rapture right you can take a rapture without this message being a headstone to you but you're going to die but you're going to die you're not going to be alive if you're alive and the rapture takes place and you don't go you're lost period no gray area there at all but now if you die 10 minutes before the rapture takes place and then you're resurrected you're okay but the ones that are alive and remain that's that special group that's that end time that he's talking about here but to get to that but to get to that remember what i said if you look this quote up i want you to all bring it with you next sunday if you got a computer but go to healing and what sickness is well never mind i'll just run you off about 30 cops i'll just run we said the world is in the spirit of the latter days now what we'll do is is i'm going to take next sunday and we're going to look at what what layout of sea of spirit is because once we realize that that's the spirit of the age then we'll realize how we can react to it i'll just do that first okay then but god won't know but the church is not in the latter day spirit yeah he's not home by the spirit of leo see he's talking about the latter-day spirit of the end time believer all right in other words we may be in a portion all down to the church ages that's what it's been it's been in a portion but god wants his church so in the spirit until they'll just fit in just anywhere god were to lead them the latter day of the rendering of the world is drinking marrying giving them marriage and all immoral things but we ministers haven't got the church yet in that spirit and we must be in that condition for what condition to make a rapture one there's only one condition you're born again right you don't have to nothing else born again to go on a rapture to be born again is it you ain't gonna have the the mysteries of the seals and the planes and the valves and everybody wants to know all these great things just good to know them but it's going to be very harmful if you just know them right going to be very harmful if you just know them we'll read next sunday where the bible says people will be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god from such turn away right from such turn away and brother branham i'll bring that quote next sunday maybe or the next couple of sundays where brother brown said high minded he said know it all now let's don't become know what i want that's what we've gotten a message a bunch of knowledge you know why because they're falling like flies been sitting in the messy church 25 years been preaching the message for 15 and 20 years and just turn it away i said no at all right that's right that's heady high mind that's a know-it-all that's somebody you can't tell that they're wrong but is that god no that's not god that's power without character that's right which is satanic that's right they have the power judas had the power heal the sick cast out devils preach the gospel but without character that's right it's satanic that's right but power with character bring it back over here fit to rule so what is power then you birth that's right right it's in power you'll be endured with power from on high jesus said that's what we're going to talk about now we have we even as christians we live a defeated life i know that even as christians we live in this layout of sin that's why i'm telling you everybody from adam to today or adam at least to pentecost they're going to be looking you up and wonder why because they read in this bible that there is an end time that people just barely going to make it because remember the five wise says hey we've got oil but we don't even have enough to give you go get your own in other words we sat in church for 20 years right we worshiped but we didn't get any oil and the ones with oil said i accepted what jesus christ did i accepted what salvation means and i've only got enough just to get me through so you got to go get it for yourself okay so let's read john three let's read the whole thing and then we'll go upstairs there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus ruler of the jews now what was nicodemus not throwing off on on him but nicodemus was a highly intelligent man of the scriptures right yes he knew the letter yes he needs a letter but he did not know the spirit or jesus would not have said what he said all right the same came to jesus by night that's another clue that he really didn't believe what jesus was saying he came to him by night slipped in the back door and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher oh in other words brother dale we know you're a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that doesn't accept god be with them that's what that's what everybody should be saying that's not born again they say oh we know brother dale's a good teacher we know by the way this good teacher we know this isn't real this is good and this and then but jesus said um barely barely i'm saying to you and except you'd be born again that's just lip service let me quote that in 21st century language he told nicodemus and that's what he said except a man be born again not born not b-o-r-n-e-d i know sometimes we say born it's not that it's born again we'll read that a little a little bit later born again not born born again he cannot see or understand the word means see means to understand in other words he's saying nicodemus you're saying i am a great preacher right but you don't know nothing about what i'm saying is what he said you don't know one thing and you know what nicodemus pruned it if i gotta go back in my mama's womb he natural all right jesus answered and said to him very verily or listen listen i say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus said very verily listen listen i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit of spirit so he separated the two all right marvel not in other words don't be surprised that i'm saying what's marvel you marvel at something you look on something with with with all or you look on something with no understanding all right marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listens and now here's the sound thereof but cast can't not tell when's it coming and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be all right jesus answered and said have you not been in a message long enough to know right are not thou a master of israel in other words don't you know what the message says and know it's not these things verily verily listen listen again i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not your witness if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you heavenly things there's a separation you're not going to know what i say just by earthly knowledge sure you're going to get a knowledge to a certain degree i understand that and no man has to ascend it up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and he was standing right there in front of what was heaven heaven consists of the word so the word was standing there so he was in heaven the day of the lord is in heaven that's right jesus was in the day of the lord he was the lord remember he said he i'm the lord of the harvest okay so he was the lord and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up talking of his death that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life he said that twice you see that don't you for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world really but that the world through him remember brother brown said jesus didn't come to bring you inheritance he come to give you a way to get back to your inheritance all right he that believeth on him is not condemned so why should we live a condemned life because we have condemnation that's he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god who was that the lord jesus christ all right and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men love darkness rather than light now we're going to bring that over into laodicea because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the life neither cometh to the light yes his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light now look he didn't say he that does truth is the light he that doeth truth cometh to the light so you can get born again but you're going to have to come to the message somewhere you're going to hear because that's what the end time spirit is is this message but you've got the holy spirit down through the ages that's been there the whole time got it so it's not a lot of you know we're not going up and down the holy ghost is the same in every age you're probably saying that's right right just what i just read you right here we'll finish right here but he that does wait a minute but everyone that does evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light yes his deed should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrong in god so you're going to do godly things that's what it says right here right you're going to do godly things that's right so there's your whole point everybody reads john 3 16. read the whole down to 21. all right let's go up front but just be studying read your bible brother said read your bible and pray i have begun starting to read my bible more and pray more than i ever have well i expect something from god sister johnny you may take a while we talk about the millennials that's what we did
