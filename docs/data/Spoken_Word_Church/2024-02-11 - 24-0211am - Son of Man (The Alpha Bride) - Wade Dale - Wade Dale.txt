========================================

we just thank you hey uh we going to read this uh Brothers in the back we're going to read Psalm 86 and not 89 but uh I had a little friend that is 3 years old well I'll tell you later what I if I can if I can't tell you but uh I got a phone call from him yesterday morning from his mother and he had got out of bed and got his brother's gun he sh can't kill us I thought I could tell you this peacefully but he he was hard that he always he did he did a lots of hard things that I had to be a little angry with him at times but most time I go to his house he would come and take my hat and came and put her at a certain place and said now sit down but uh you know you do things and everybody will blame his L your brother for leaving away and get hands on it but that's not the way it is I told said well you know I feel this way about it he is in a better place than he was here yes with his parents that didn't take proper care and raising him and uh you know there's nothing that you can you can do or nothing we can do but just be thankful that God give us the chance to do it and it it's it's a matter that we need to know how we're raising our children and RA in peaceful way the older brothers that had the gun they did things they're not supposed to do his mother's grandmothers none of them really truly live falling God you know they go to church sometime when they feel like it but they don't follow God every day you know it's an everyday thing with raising children and raising ourselves so we must have to just keep it playing keep it going forward I wanted to give this to brother Ryan let him read it because I didn't know that I would be able to do it but he still will be a friend and I hope that I can get my life make sure my life is right that when I leave this earth we can sit down together again so let us pray and just just remember that family and families that's involved in that situation Heavenly Father we thank you again this morning to be with us and to bless us L we ask you to come Among Us Lord and to deliver yourselves unto our hearts father we know that we have needs and we want you to Lord to answer all of them Lord we know that you promised if we would repent Lord you would and and and be baptized Lord that you you would give unto us the Holy Ghost and that's what we desire we ask you wherever we go whatever we do Lord let your love and light be shining in our hearts father we ask you for the little boy I know that maybe suffered for a minute or two but God we you seem fit to bring him on home to you Lord and we ask you to bless his family and touch him Lord that they may see and realize the laws Lord that they will accept you as that personal savior God here we are as this time lord later than we think maybe but father help us I know I've lived a long life Lord and ask you just continue to be with me Lord that I may do all that you want that's pleasing in your sight we ask you for the services that this morning Lord as we hear let our hearts be surrendered God and we thank you and ask you to guide us and lead us in Jesus name we pray amen you know I thought of a thing I seen somewhere to talk about old people when they get old they have to try twice as hard to do half as good so just pray that I can get part of that done I I know we sometime come in a little bit late but we trying so we going to keep going till we get it straight amen we're going to read from Psalm 861 1 through 17 bow down thine ear oh Lord hear me for I am poor and needy preserve my soul for I am Holy oh thou my God save th servant that trusteth in thee be merciful unto me oh lord for I cry unto thee daily the soul of thto the I lift up for thou Lord are good and to forgive and plous in Mercy unto all them that call upon thee pray and attend to the voice of my suppli in the day of my trouble I will call upon thee for thou will answer me am God isther works works all nations whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee Oh Lord and shall glorify thy name God Alone teach me thy way oh Lord I will walk in thy truth unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name I will praise you Lord my God with all my heart I glorify name forever for great is thy mercy towards me and thou H has delivered my soul from the lowest hell against me and the assies after my soul and have not set me before them for thou oh Lord are a God full of compassion and glorious longsuffering plous in Mercy and Truth unto me and have mercy upon me give th strength th and the son of th show me a token for good that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou Lord has helped me and comforted me amen God bless you may be seated am certainly we keep that family in prayer you know when he was reading verse 15 it says oh Lord art a God full of compassion gracious longsuffering plenteous and mercy and Truth do you believe he's that have God is in you are you that we have to be that we have to surrender to be that mercy and Truth to one another and uh brother colie he reminded me of many stories of things you know you don't understand why uh events happen like that um we live in a age of mental health where spirits and things attack the mind and it's important to take time if you feel led to talk to another person just how are you feeling you know sometimes the default answer is I'm good I'm great how are you really feeling you know let's let's see what's going on in your life cuz we we are supposed to be God to each other with flesh and to take time to be patient one with another and you know hey there's times where I don't know about you but there's times where I don't want to live sometimes you know and the Devil comes in with those thoughts and just you're not worth nothing you know um and not to take too much time or be out of order I saw this clip one time it showed two men in their lives and they were friends and they would go to like a soccer game together together and one just wasn't very almost like he was kind of depressed and the other one was just up and cheering was active and just bubbly all the time and it continued on like that and then it went back to the game and the one that seemed kind of depressed sometime had a shirt he put in an empty chair his friend took his own life he was dealing with depression and things and but externally you didn't see that right you didn't see it so we we we fight Spirits we we fight things in the Unseen uh but we can also let the Lord use our words to sit down and and get things out and just talk things through and say I'm here for you let's pray together let's walk through this together and that's God using you in your life and it's important to do that amen so uh brother Michael would you come this morning and uh the tiing

yesterday she's 90 something years old they did a partial HP replacement well anyway they're watching online Julie said they were watching online so so we're praying for you sister colen and uh AIDS don't mean anything to God so U we pray that that's going to heal back up cuz it broke in a very hard place it broke right at the ball where the ball goes in it broke it right here so um excuse me want to pray for that also remember the Ferguson family they're friends of ours group up together neighbors uh we're going to be leaving here uh soon after we get finished with the service they have a um a 5 to eight viewing he uh he's a little bit younger than me and um he um was hospitalized and then they couldn't get him back so he he passed away so just remember that family he was a Methodist Minister also so just remember that and prayer so all minds and hearts clear today we're going to talk about the alpha bride which the alpha bride is what that's the one that started on day of Pentecost all right we're the Omega bride where the book ends but we're supposed to be just like they are remember the last age gets all the blessings and all the curs es of all the other ages they pile up right here on us so every blessing they get what God hated there he hates here what God loves there he loves here amen then we'll look at that and I also want you to if you want to um if you got a little time I appreciate what brother Bob had to say today we really all need to be more fervent in what we do and move on with God and uh and put him first in everything and and not everything else but um but look at the look at this Church look at the city of Ephesus we were talking about this a little bit the other day the city of Ephesus almost mirrors the city of leosa so we're going to talk about that maybe next Sunday or Sunday after when we speak against brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday remember the banquet this coming weekend just pray for brother collie and his the family there that uh tragedy there um his friend so let's just go to the Lord in pray Lord thank you for the Bride of Jesus Christ for the word that you give us and that we become that word the word has become flesh and a group of people father I pray now that you would take the isav of the Holy Spirit as you were there in the last Church age you said by of me these things and use the isav because Lord sometimes uh truly as brother Bob say sometimes the world blinds us to the things that we need but father you said You' give us eyes have that would we could see Lord what you are giving us in the end time lord it's become a late hour it's time to get out of here things are not going to get better in the world they're just going to get worse but Lord if if we have a pavilion that we can run into and Lord we do you gave us that you gave us the Holy Ghost and you gave us as the prophet said we are now in the layout of c and age we are pressurized for what's coming we know we're astronauts we don't live here we have a whole different mindset Lord and I pray that you just break this word down to each one of us today heal the sick raise the dead Lord bless each one that's not here that's sick Lord sister Joyce and brother Danny different ones Lord I pray that you'd be with them Father bless us Lord in Jesus name amen so we're going to talk about today the alpha bride so we're going to look at the Ephesian church not the Ephesian Church the Ephesian bride all right because there is an Ephesian Church everybody with me we went through all these Services about the difference in a church and a bride all right the bride's the Bride of Jesus Christ the church is there everything else all right and they don't all go to heaven don't get silent they don't all go to heaven but all the bride does so if you insert yourself over here you're good all right Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega you know those two words Alpha is the first letter in the Greek alphabet Omega is the last A and Z the first and the last what thou seest right in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus saara Sardis Philadelphia and lead and I turned to see the voice that spoke with me and I being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to paps with a golden girdle his head and his hair was white like wool white as snow and his eyes were as flames of fire and his feet like in Define brass if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in it strength you may be seated we we covered those seven uh uh different um attributes of God there in the uh last couple of sermons but we see that he was in the midst he he was in the midst had two things in his hand he had the church and he had the the the the messengers all right so he had everything there he listen regardless of mankind and the devil God's going to have a church a bride God's going to have a bride doesn't matter you you can sit here and you can fold your arms and you can go to sleep like Bob said but you're not going to stop the program of God don't think your one little self is going to stop the program of God no you can hinder it though and then you if You Hinder it you going to be held responsible for it not God you are and we looked at the prism so we got one God one Lord and Savior Jesus Christ not a trinit Doctrine a Triune revelation of God that he is all these things but he's one person all right but we see the prism and if you put that light through the prism it runs seven different colors well those seven different colors or the seven Church ages because the seven Church ages is a complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ in his bride that's what he decided not us all right he decided he's going to showcase his best and you're not going to stop it and I'm not going to stop it he will showcase his best he has a masterpiece and he will put her on display he's put her on display in part from from one Church age to this one but today in this church age he is going to show the fullness because we're to be the fullness of the godhead bodily in the end time in a bride everybody with me we'll talk a little bit this afternoon about the father's Throne because it's it's different than Jesus's throne am well those of you that know said amen those of you didn't you'll know this afternoon if you'll come back but there's a difference cuz he sat on he say sit with me in my Throne as I set in my father's Throne so there's it's not two or three different Thrones in three or four different people it's one person in a different manifestation we know that right all right so John 1:14 is a promise this word is going to be made flesh and dwelt Among Us it is going to be your flesh and my flesh all right and this is a start of a new dispensation this is something so new that what happened and right it's a transition between John the Baptist and then Jesus comes on the scene and then Jesus leaves and the disciples take the full word of God the religious World hated them didn't love them didn't didn't didn't not with open arms no no no they hated the true word of God Amen and we'll look later on I mean they cut Paul's head off they killed every disciple except John John was the only one John the Revelator was the only one he was and Jesus said he's one that's going to write all these he told him when he was still alive but John was a young baby of the bunch and in ad90 something he became the pastor of the Ephesian church and we'll read that a little bit later on when we get into Ephesus because Ephesus was a religious Center like now a religious Center that a lot of people came to Mary was there John James different ones di in that City and um John was a pastor of the church there but this new dispensation was so new that Satan knew there was something coming but he couldn't stop it but he sure tried cuz he killed them all he killed everybody he killed he killed Paul before his time I mean ad50 something is when the church age started and ad60 something is when they cut Paul's head off right at the first of that age but what happened was God knew that there'd be a group of people right group of people that would carry this message on to the coming of the Lord or to the end of that church age that they were in but remember God never raises that man back up he's finished with him I'm sorry he's finished with him everybody Moses amen didn't bring bring didn't bring brought Moses back up Joshua took over all right right David got too much blood on your hands but I'm going to have a temple Solomon's going to build this Temple for me so David laid away and then the same thing Paul Paul laid away iren it's different ones and even brother brandham laid away laid away so that the bride could mature to his message the bride in the first age matured to Paul's message they took Paul's message and become a mature Church like Ephesus and different ones but we'll get to that so Hebrews 10 says look by a New and Living Way so it's going to be something new so even that if it was new then now Alpha if it was new then it's going to be new now because remember they had just come out of the manifestation of the son of man he was on Earth himself literally speaking to the people right God in flesh amen well he can't come back though in that flesh while we're here or you got two bodies that's why you can't have two heads that's why everything's got to be done correctly but over here in the end time what's the same thing the son of man is to be revealed and not through one person though through a bride but there had to be a spokesman come on the scene to tell us you can make it you're astronauts now you're not the right Brothers if you were to raise the right Brothers up now and say hey that's what when y'all went to Kitty Hawk and you were like 200 feet off or 100 feet off the ground for 15 or 20 yards or or however how many 100 yards it was and you landed look what we're doing now we're running 1500 M an hour and we're going to space now we're coming back started with the right Brothers started in the first church age God's moving on folks God's moving on whether we want him to or not we're we got to get in the program but a New and Living Way so it's got to be not just dead letter it's got to be a new living way which started on the day of Pentecost that's where the alpha bride started was on the day of Pentecost is everybody with me all right but there had to be a new testament or a New Covenant or a new will the old one was do and don'ts do this don't do that I haven't touched no girl I haven't committed adultery Jesus said I say unto you if you even look on her and lust after her you've committed he didn't do away with the Commandment he magnified the commandment and said hey it's not the touching part it's what you think in your mind all right everybody with me amen so now we're looking at a New Testament Jesus said in First Corinthians this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me this is the communion scripture after the same manner also he took the cup and when he up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood the Old Testament was blood of bulls and goats the Old Testament was lambs and doves and and all that but that that Soul which an animal don't have a soul but that Spirit of that animal couldn't come into you that's right but Jesus Christ could CU he was the soul of God and he could disperse himself in many ways just like he did on the day of Pentecost this cup is the New Testament in my blood this D you of as you drink it in remembrance of me that's why we take communion to remember the Lord all right Hebrews 9:11 says but Christ being a high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building because what was the Old Testament and confence was in it Jesus was in the Old Testament come on Jesus was in the Old Testament the New Testament don't start till the book of Acts he just said it right here this was when he was dying going to the cross and then then at Penta 50 days later he came back on the day of Pentecost all right but he's telling he told them they said uh well destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days and you know confusing them the the the legalist of the bunch we 40 something years building that Temple I the world he going to knock it down in three days he wasn't talking about that he was talking about this yes talking about the Temple of his body he says not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once to the holy place he didn't have to go back every year you don't have to go back every year amen to get the Holy Ghost having obtained Eternal Redemption for me and you that's Body Spirit and soul all right for if the blood of bulls and goats and Ashes of heer sprinkled the unclean if that was if that worked we should stayed under it under it amen but it didn't work it didn't work the way the New Testament wanted it to work God didn't want us to just live like the devil for 364 days and then on the day of atonement he goes and makes an atonement one priest does and then we go back out live the way we want to that's not what he wanted he wanted us to live a Sanctified life 24/7 the best we can all right I said the best we can cuz I Don't Preach sinless Perfection we all have flaws and we all have things we have to work on all right well you don't pray for me how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit see there was no eternal spirit that could come into a believer in the Old Testament all right only in the New Testament everybody with me the eternal spirit offered himself without Spa to God Purge your conscience from dead words to serve the Living God he's asking a question and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the the promise of Eternal inheritance nobody in the Old Testament got an eternal inheritance oh yeah they're going to receive things amen they're going to receive things but they didn't have that Eternal you got your Eternal inheritance right here today sent with you if you're born again amen they which call might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is or a will or a covenant is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator like I said before uh you don't go to a will reading while and the guy that wrote the whe sitting in the room with you right he's got to be passed on he's got to have left you something he left us something he left us the well in the spirit to what to live the well for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth in other words Jesus stood there for three and a half years and preached the perfect he was the perfect example nobody believed him nobody there wasn't one person saved except the thief on the cross there wasn't one person saved in his ministry time they didn't understand him but it wasn't for them it was for us second Corinthians 3 says Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of accommodation to you or letters of accommodation from you you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared by the Epistle of Christ ministered by us so it's got to be ministered by a person amen written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God you know they didn't have many scribes they had scribes but they didn't have many people that had tape recorders in Paul's day they had to remember what Paul said and be awake well look that one guy Paul preached a long guy died right he fell out of he fell he fell out of a window but Paul said well that's my fault I'm going to go down there and pray for him and he raised him from the dead all right so okay anyway not going any further with that written not with ink we'll pray for you if you fall out okay but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in F fleshly tables of the heart and such trust we have through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves or think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God I hope you have that on your refrigerator our sufficiency is of God all right who also hath made us oh he's transferred something into well he made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the Spirit giveth Life we'll see in just a few minutes how that affected the first church age and even affected the first bride all right so now let's skip on through for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory all right in other words we got grace and mercy Hebrews 10 ver1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the C there unto perfect but in those sacrifices there's a remembrance every year they had a day of atonement they still do it they don't have a temple but they still the Orthodox Jew they know what the day of atonement is and that's the day that everything gets forgiven right and they're looking to build that Temple so they can start doing that so the Messiah can come for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goat should take away sin wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayth sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me in other words a body you he prepared one for himself to live in and then he left and come back on the day of Pentecost to get his body ready Hallelujah called a bride so a body thou Hast prepared me let's continue on uh remember brother R say she is him we we understand that let's continue on now look in the seven Church ages brother Brown said look that's the Bible 1954 he said in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like the son of man what one like him who was that his bride so do I need to say that anymore I'm not going to read that scripture again or read that quote again it's the bride standing there bride form it's the son of man standing there but he's in Bride form all right one like him watch clothed with a garment down to the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood all right GED about the PS not a man a woman right with a golden girdle look I like what the brother said about the golden girdle what does that girdle do it comes around your waist right it's the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ amen the glory held the glory of the Bride of Jesus Christ brother M says in 1954 he says we found the church standing there in its beauty I'm just reviewing a little bit till I get started here Christ just molded into it the church had a white garment on and you notice it was a woman around the breast it had to cover her shame and was had a golden cord though pulled around like that held around the breast white speaking of the righteousness of Christ and the golden girdle representing the gospel the preaching of the Gospel brings the Holy Spirit over the church we're going to see in a minute where that got took away all right by the nician spirit all right and let me caution you if there was a nician spirit in the first church age there's definitely one in the second in the last Church age right which holds something over the people the righteousness of Christ holds it there tied with the string the girdle string all right now here each age has had its message and its messenger all right now some of you got the thing in your hand or around there somewhere this is church Ages which is um I think some of you got them but uh we'll take a look at them a little bit later I'll pull it up on the screen each a age had its message and messenger all through the times every age has packed its message with a messenger like I said before Paul had an age irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley Pentecost and now in our church age all right cuz remember the church ages started on the day of Pentecost but brother brandom takes the church ages to ad 50s something is when it began we'll get into that in just a minute cuz you got to have listen whatever the pattern is here you got to have over there whatever the pattern is I'm sorry whatever the pattern is here had to have happened in the first church age all right God in every dispensation sent forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time now we start back but that was the message God was the first messenger he told Adam and Eve eat that don't eat that that was the message and when man stepped across the message of the hour it brought death and chaos to the whole human race now that's how much that message means abely right only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is a messenger to the look the true church which would be the bride he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group of people in a certain way that's why brother brammy said they said what is the Holy Ghost he said accepting the message of the hour for your day accepting it you turn it down you don't have the Holy Ghost those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God so we believe God sent a prophet right well we listen to what he said because it was God speaking to us through that prophet and then we take and we break it down further so that the people can understand that's why you need a five-fold Ministry and not just listen to tapes you can't just listen to tapes and get perfected you can't you might come to the message and believe God sent a prophet and be baptized and all these different things but unless that word comes alive in your heart and we begin to show it began to live it like brother B said you can't show it at home some tried some tried to set it home and we got some that that set it home here and listen listen listen when we're preaching here you we're preaching to a lot of people besides what's sitting in this building today all right and uh then um archive sermons are are are listened all around the world so it's not just us that we're talking to God's not just talking to us here he's talking to worldwide uh this church affects a lot of people it does it affects a lot of people a lot of foreign brothers and different one it affects anything goes on here it affects the it affects the other churches but praise God that's okay now watch look what happened a seal is open what is that now he's in the first seal now watch what he's and I'll break this down a little bit later on and put it on that chart a mystery is unfolding now here you got the day of Pentecost and we'll talk about it in just a minute you got the day of Pentecost Paul wasn't there right all right is everybody listen Paul was not the 120 in the upper room that's when the alpha bride began though was on the day of Pentecost but Paul wasn't there Peter was the spokesman because Paul didn't have the key Peter had the key Paul was out there persecuting them that got born again but he got a conversion could you bring could you imagine bringing your arch enemy into your room right and say oh we got to listen to him now and anas is like Lord you sure that that's all he's killed a bunch of my friends he caused him to blaspheme he put them in prison he said oh I got to work for him don't worry I listen my ways are not your ways my ways are way above yours Paul's going to be my messenger Peter had the key to unlock the door but Peter says and we'll read it this afternoon where Peter says that Paul says things hard to be understood so Paul Peter didn't have the same Revelation Paul did I didn't say it was different he didn't have the same because you got different levels of Revelation so watch when a mystery unfolds a trumpet sounds Paul steps on the scene announces his message it declares a war what that war is what killed him that's war that war is what killed Jesus that war is what killed all the church age back in that first church age the martyrs they didn't weren't martyred because they didn't like them and they weren't martyred because of their ethnicity they were murdered because of their different view of the present day gospel amen now if that happened in the first age it's got to happen here too but they don't have brother Ram he he magnifies it he says oh they don't have to kill you personally he said they just kill your influence the angelist church catches the mystery of God so Paul called The Mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and He Goes Forth and what he preaches to the people and they listen after the mystery has been given to him Goes Forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim the message and what does it start it starts a spiritual war all right and when God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays him away like I just said when he's finished with the messenger he's done with him you say that sounds rough that's the way God said he was going to do from the beginning to the end amen when he's finished he's finished all right he don't raise him back up and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep then he drops a plague upon them that reject it problem is now you reject this message and you going to go into a real plague like called a tribulation period he drops a plague upon them who rejected a temporary judgment that's why we see all the flames of fire foot of brass and all the different things God in judgment the bride is going to judge every Church age every every bride member in their age will judge the people of that age all right they denominated bring in denomination and started off that man's work like Wesley and all the rest of them then it gets into a scrapple again and then another mystery comes forth and what happens another messenger arrives on Earth for a church age like I was saying last week you got Paul he preaches he preaches there's a lot of people come into the message then as you get long and further just like you and I sight and time is what our worst enemy we start falling away from our first love and then God sends irenius and says hey here's a message I want you to give this group of people and it raises back up the problem now is there's no way the only thing if you go down you go into tribulation there is no other Messenger to bring you back up all right there has to be an alpha and there has to be a Omega and when he arrives the trumpet sounds what a message declares a war but then what happens finally he's called away then when he's laid away then plagues fall destroys them look spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group then he goes on to another one all right Revelations 1 ver8 I am Alpha and Omega he said this four times in in Revelation I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty showing his de saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seeth write in a book and send it to the seven churches now remember the alpha church was Ephesus the Omega Church is leosa the one you're sitting in right now and it is the beginning and ending of the Gentile bride dispensation all right everybody with me cuz while H when the last Gentile is saved the door is closed God will never save another Gentile amen until the white Throne judgment he may give him eternal life that's okay but he turns directly to the Jews God doesn't ever go backwards he always goes forward I'm going to get to the Jews I'm going to get 144,000 I'm going to bring them in and then I'm going to bring my bride back to the Earth in the Millennium with 144,000 he just keeps moving you know what he does though he takes me and you with it if we don't stop amen he was both Alpha and Omega of course all that was in between the two all the other letters but he specifically said Alpha and Omega what brother man saying is now he wasn't the holy ghost in the first age and Holy Ghost in the seventh age and nothing in between he was the Holy Ghost in every Church age but there was a gift given different for the alpha CU that was a beginning that's the way he want his church started and the Omega is the way he wants the church to end and they've got to be together excuse my voice I've been dealing with some sinus drainage but he specifically said Alpha and Omega he had a rainbow over his head which was his Covenant now if you notice the light of Pentecost where it started gradually smothered out all right these men irenius polycart and all the rest of them sealed their testimony with their blood until it finally squeez Christianity into the dark days or the Dark Ages or that middle age that 1500 age that the Catholic Church ruled the world now look the first age the other side of that great hump coming over now had what the middle then the next one was what Luther Wesley Pentecost leosa called lukew all right in the sardian church age Christ Holy Spirit still holding here on down here until the end of the world the same holy spirit that filled Paul with the Holy Ghost and the things that he done will fill this one irenius full of the Holy Ghost fill Martin full of the Holy Ghost and the rest of them full of the Holy Ghost and it filled you and I full of the Holy Ghost and it's a Pentecostal blessing from one Church age to the other now the problem with people in P in in the message there's two factions one said we need to stay in Pentecost and and and accept the message and still have our you know our shouting good time and then there's a group over here that says God left that and you know we just got the message and that's it well what happens is is you got to bring it right in between you got to bring it right in the middle all right we as a church should have the Pentecostal blessing I wish somebody would shout I wish somebody would speaking tongues I wish somebody would AIS but that not every service not every service I like what brother Donnie Reagan said he said look when you're at home that's home church he said special meetings are special run shout speaking tongue cuz you're happy you're going to a meeting you you're meeting your fellow members and you you but he said at home he does the same thing here at his church and he says hey well you know wake up a little bit here so look his hand transforms a cross and and here's Jesus standing in the church age and said I am Alpha and Omega in other words I'll be the Supreme in the first and I'll be the Supreme in the last all right now what did he do in the first chapter of Revelations he revealed his Supreme deity to the first church Ephesus now in the in the Church of Ephesus they didn't have a trinitarian Doctrine they started one they didn't the the bride didn't now over here same thing You Got trinitarianism The Whole World's covered by trinitarianism and brother Brown said that seed that was planted by Satan in the first church age has grown into a tree over here in this age and then he said I read this to you several several several Services ago that those two Vines are intertwined and without the Holy Ghost you won't be able to tell one Vine from the other deceive the very elect if it were possible so so close not so far away every one of these churches come down through here he revealed himself in deity now watch his wording he revealed himself in deity only in his glorified form because remember Columba was a trinitarian Luther was a trinitarian Wesley was a trinitarian and the first part of Pentecost was trinitarian now that didn't come from the mind of God but he winked at their ignorance and gave them something else gave Luther the just shall live by faith gave Wesley living S A Sanctified life but for me and you to be the two book ends we've got to that's why that that brother R said this messenger of Malachi do Malachi 4 do two things what return us back to what they preached in the first church age all right and then bring the seals to change our body they didn't have that to change their body down here they had the word of God they didn't have a denomination well they did but they didn't have one on every corner like we do and a lot of times in our congregation every one of these churches coming down through here he revealed himself in deity only in his glorified form but on this last one he becomes Z back to the original beginning again see the first and the last the first age now the last age for he said I am the first and the last Masterpiece the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the or last message is the same thing as I was in Alpha I'm in Omega there'll be a day that won't be called day or night but in the evening time what the sun the Sun what comes up in the East and sets in the west we're a Western Country hello for those that are geographically challenged that's why they call it the Middle East cuz it's over there and then what is opposite from East somebody help me thank you West okay but there'll be a day that won't be called day or night but in the evening time right now today you're in the evening light of the message of the hour you're in the evening light of the ending of the Gentile dispensation see Alpha and Omega but it becomes the first and last said we could stay for hours now remember the vision brother R had he he had a the bride came into view then all of a sudden they went off praising God and dressed right and all that then here come the American church that was naked twisting turning shaking and all that different stuff and he was having a hard time looking at it and he he turned to the to the angel and said is this what I produced and the angel said hold on a minute the bride will come into view again well that was the alpha bride that went by and the Omega bride was the last one that come by sure she got out step a little bit but she was dressed right and brother R is the one that followed and said get back in line well I'm telling us get back in line but the Bride come into view twice he said that's the reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time she was perfectly the second like she was in the first all right the only thing we can glory in is that God started that church right and if we'll get in that church we'll be started right and we'll actually end right all right but the bride came back cuz she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor and made him a masterpiece for it's a piece of his first masterpiece like he did in the Garden of Eden and took a piece from and made another piece Adam and made Eve and was that was marred and fail now he's been all this time building it back again and he brought forth this masterpiece was smitten in order that part of it was smitten in order to bring back again that Masterpiece what was he saying Masterpiece First Church age smitten during the ages false Doctrine death huh come on then he's come over here to get his Masterpiece again he had to come through all that to get the Masterpiece again all right is everybody with me so the Masterpiece and the Son of God the Masterpiece and the bride it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word of God Revelations 2 verse1 so let's look at this under the angel the Church of La of Ephesus right now we looked at that and saw the how Ephesus and lus says of not in all right these things sayth he that holdeth the Seven Stars now this is this is what the first Age come under and his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden coun counter sticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience now remember this is the first stage but it's also connected to us and how thou cast not bear them which are evil false Doctrine and thou Hast tried them which say the apostles and are not and H has found them Liars what brother say give the word test and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake H hasth labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love all of a sudden here we are in from ad30 which is the day of Pentecost to ad50 something they already had people intertwined in their sermon or in their congregation that was going Jesus wasn't really gone sthus was one close in irenius but but he was a like substance he couldn't have been God cuz he had all this these that's how it got started we'll talk about in just a second it starts as a saying to a deed to a Doctrine right nevertheless because th left your first love remember therefore from when thou art Fallen now look remember where you came from remember the day of Pentecost remember your day of Pentecost the day you re receive the Holy Ghost is your day of Pentecost God filled you with the Holy Ghost if you could have seen a tongue of fire it would have been a tongue of fire over your head and it fell right down in your soul burnt you out made you a new Creator in creature in Christ that ought to make you happy that ought to make the ball game people shout remember was that a AI okay all right I didn't think there ever was an old guy sitting in a ball game doing like that remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent now remember how are you reminded Paul writes letters to Corinthians Ephesians Timothy Corinthians second time all these different he's reminding them of the message of the hour that's why we stand in the pull pit and remind you of the message of the hour we don't say something different from brother Brandon we remind you of what he's already said all right but now look if you don't repent if you don't continue on with me he said I am going to remove your Candlestick in other words you are going to quench the Holy Ghost right out of your service right right I will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent now he goes on and continues but this thou has there was one thing that first age had that God loved that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate so God can't change his mind if he hated it in the first age he's going to hate it in this age everybody with me he hates it he doesn't he he don't even want to tolerate it in his bride church now what is the Deeds of the nicians a deed is an undertaking an act something you do all right and this is kind of strange cuz I want you to see how Satan is he's not far from the truth even with a nickan attitude there was actually a man named Nicholas and look in your Bible it's in the book of Acts I didn't know it he's one of seven men that was given the Holy Ghost to lead the church with they took and misconstrued Nicholas's Doctrine and look what happened cuz nican niik actually means Victory or conquer and that's where you get the word Nike from that's why you wear your shoes it says Nike it's got the Nike thing on it cuz it's victory that hurt cuz it's victory but anyway it mean that's what Nike means Nico Victory or conquer victory over letin means members or Ley in other words the congregation now watch nanism means followers of Nicholas so they started following the right set everybody with me this sound familiar they started following the person of the hour all right or one of them named Nicholas is in the Bible all right whose Deeds were strongly condemned they may have been identical with those who held the doctrine of balum they seem to have held it that was it was lawful to eat things sacrificed to Idols commit fornication in opposition to the decree of the church rendered in Acts 15:20 the teachers of the church branded them with a name which expressed their true character the men who did and taught such things were followers of balam let me stop right here real quick brother arm tells us about old balum remember balam was a prophet of God God spoke to balam Bam was a prophet so they so the whoever that is got balam and said hey I want you we we know you hear from God right we know you hear from God we want you to curse them people over there called Israelites we hate them they're just a thorn in our flesh I want you to curse him what' bam say he said I can only say What God Says and God couldn't condemn him cuz that was his kids so what did the guy say he says uh balum uh whatever you do uh is you a little bit of payment here if you'll just hang around a little bit and no you're not you if you'll just hang around a little bit we'll get you some more of this that's my brother R called bam a hirling prophet all right we I've seen it before you can't have a hirling prophet in the message of the hour yeah you can have one yeah but it ain't right cuz bam said I can only say what God Said but I got some smarts about me since I'm getting paid I got to do my job I can get them to mingle with each other and remember that was it that was the downfall that's called a hirling prophet or the doctrine of balum all right and balum was a hired Pro hired prophet he was a prophet but he was hired to do a job that's why um through this whole thing I want y'all to understand something a hirling is somebody gets paid and if they don't do their job they don't get paid right okay just want you to realize that that's why a pastor should is never going to have somebody tell them how much you can make it's not the way it is you can't insert yourself above from God to the pastor pastor's complete control Supreme control either that or you're a hirling well you can say this but don't say that or we'll will withdraw money from you remember brother Dell said that's what they did in in uh the church that we used to go to if they didn't like the preacher what he preached they just withdrew his his pay told him said if you don't preach this we're going to hold your pay or if you going to go do that in the pull pit we're going to withhold your pay now folks that's balam Spirit that's a denominational Spirit that's a nickan spirit which God hates everybody with me I'm in the Bible I'm not emotional I'm just in the Bible this the Bible tells us what to do absolutely cuz look they persuaded men more than ever that it was a thing indiffer they got up and said hey don't worry about you ain't got to do you ain't got to go church just press play mingling themselves look this was bad enough but there was yet a worse evil mingling themselves with the orgies of idolatrous feast they brought the impurities of those Feast into the meetings of the Christian church and all this was done it must be remembered not simply as an Indulgence of appetite but as part of a system supported by Doctrine accompanied by the boast of prophetic illumination wow to hate these Deeds though is a sign of life in a church see that's why Church you have got to understand one thing there is no person in this church has a boat different than yours nobody Amen brother Brown says I have one only have one vote and I only vote if there's a tie so the pastor doesn't even vote but you have one vote no person has three votes and you got one you all got one vote if you're a tithe paying member of the church you get one vote but if you want to keep the dies of nians around and be suppressed and go right ahead I saw a church up in Pennsylvania bless your heart you've been there before brother Jim youat Church where there was a deacon that run a place I mean he run a place and I knew that cuz I went up there and they asked me to consider being pastor this been 20 years ago brother Jim was a little bit younger then brother Michael met brother Jim shate so brother Jim sheate was trying to find were trying to find a pastor the pastor died and this one Deacon he had come into a large sum of money and he ran to church well it's a truth I tell you how he done though he conquered the Ley so bad to nobody move without him saying anything and they went years without a pastor finally got a couple up there and then at the very end toward the boat one of the brothers said well hey I need to see the I need to see the church books and I you know this and and the brother said no no uh uh I'm going to pay you this and this is what it's going to be and you're going to be well the guy said no you ain't going to get nobody in this message to do that I'll promise you that but 6 months later after that Pastor left I mean that they were going to put him in VOD him in or V him out whatever V him in Brother David fell over Dead with a heart attack 6 months later and then brother Jim shoemate took over as the pastor of the church God's going to have his way and he hates the Deeds of the nickol he hates for us to be suppressed all of us we need to have freedom to worship any way we want to we need to have freedom to say hey I love you I love you I love you and mean it but you hate those deeds as a L of life in a church to hate them but if you tolerate them to tolerate them is well not to Forfeit the glory of having been Faithfully under persecution to tolerate them you're going to die to hate them you have life God's going to have a church amen run right he cuz listen and he had it run right in the first church age and brother Brandon was over here in the last Church age and he says all right this is the way it's supposed to be you read condori Doctrine that's exactly the way the church was running it first is the way it should be run now right all right he didn't deviate from that brother B didn't add he said this is what they did in the first church so this is what we're going to do here he that have the near let him hear what the spirit sayth un the churches to him that overcome will I give to e of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God so now the alpha church is born now the alpha church was not born with Paul around this is important because as a messenger in the church ages I believe it was Columba died before the church age even started but his message listen God wants the message to go forth get away from a man yes sir you put a man up here God going to take him out of the way you put God up here through a man then you'll s you'll be successful the alpha church is born acts 1 ver7 he said unto them it is not for you to die this is Jesus now he's fix he's going to tell the church where to start at thank God Jesus is the one doing this it's not for you to know the times or Seasons cuz what look they're they're they've come up to here sister Virginia they've come up to here and they're all around him and they said he said I'm I got to go away I you know in other words John 17 he said I'm going to get out of here destroy this Temple I'm going to raise it up I I've been resurrected now for 50 days y'all know I've been walking around in a glorified body for 50 days and they're going you going to stay here and restore the kingdom and he and he's like have I not taught you anything no he was longsuffering and this is what he said it's not for you to know the times of the seasons which the father ha put in his own power but you shall receive power transfer of power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth and we're living by that right now cuz whatever that first church started Living by we got to live by it or we're not the church in the end time all right and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they look steadfast toward heaven now remember whatever happens in the first church age has got to happen in the last Church age Christ left in a cloud and last Church age he came back in the cloud all right cuz look this is the prophecy and while they look steadfast toward Heaven two men stood by them in white apparel two angels stepped in the dimension stood there and told him and said which also said you been of Galilee why are you gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven and we believe that the Lord came on in 1963 now not his whole not his body but the doctrine the doctrine of the seals it put everything back together it put everything the way it was supposed to be Christ came down in Revelations 10:7 and put everything together Luke 24:46 and he said said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem so the beginning of the of the now listen hold on a minute let me interject something here they come in under a Pentecostal age Ephesian Church age didn't start to ad50 something that's not a church age that's got a circle but if you look on your chart right there at the first it's not written in there yet but they're going to write that in there you're going to write Pentecost CU if the first age listen they got to be miror if the first age CH started with Pentecost the last age started with 1906 Auda Street Pentecost to open up the age the Alpha and the Omega got to be the same but remember they didn't they didn't stand that they continued on they picked up Paul you know what I'm talking about they were preaching for 20 something years before Paul well actually they were preaching and Paul was killing them for that 20 something years he was he was uh the thorn in their flesh now look and what repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem now remember there was a lot of Jews in that 120 the upper room but remember when they went downstairs and we'll get to it not this afternoon but but later on the day of Pentecost is a day of feasting people Gather in that's why there was when when Peter goes out and he speaks and tells the people all of them are looking at each other and there's a about um there's probably two verses of nothing but scythians and and galileans and it names all the people why they were gathered at Pentecost wasn't just a Jewish feast huh when you have a when you have a i a say it when you have a feast around here more people come so anyway while they were having their Pentecostal Feast there were people that come but but listen God had to do that because he wanted to take that to the Gentiles all those were Gentiles Peter goes outside he preaches a sermon and they say what oh we're pricked in our heart we never heard this before what do we need to do he said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for they Mission your sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and 3,000 people were saved in one day boy what a baptismal service 3,000 in one day and it was not Jews it was all Gentiles and you a witness of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you now this is what we'll get to this afternoon behold I'll send the promise of my father upon you because remember Peter said my promise his promise is to be the son of David in the Millennium to rule the 12 tribes of Israel he knew what he was saying because listen David's Throne is in the Millennium he sat on his daddy's Throne or the father's Throne by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the church ages that's why he's saying right here I'll prove it to you I'll read you the quotes Brother D preached it a long time ago about the father's Throne he preached several sermons on that and you are witness of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but carry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now Acts 2 verse1 says when the day of Pentecost was fully come what does Pentecost mean pent means what 5 50 all right so 50 was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty went and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared under them clothing tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with a Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under Heaven here we go I did put it in here now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded why they come from all over the world Amen listen folks what happened when man got together at Babel man got together to build their Kingdom perfect Kingdom what did God do he can founded their language come over here on the day of Pentecost God's fixing to set his kingdom up oh come on somebody God set his kingdom up and they all they heard him in their own language that's what's going to be when we get into Millennium when we get over in a future home we're not going to need brother Eric and and brother Lis to to you know tell us what he said no I'll hear it in English and when I speak to him he'll hear it in Spanish praise God am yes sir amen that's my God but they were confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language so there was there was hundreds of people thousands and every one of them they did not even interpreter Peter was saying one one he preached one sermon and they all heard him in a different language that's speaking in tongues to me that is speaking in tongues now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and Marvel saying one to another behold are not these which speak galileans no they were Jews and how we hear every man in our own language where we were born oh here we are parthians mes elamites dwellers in Mesopotamia Judea capadia pontis Asia this is not Jews Persia Pampa Egypt parts of Libya sirene strangers of Rome Jews and PR creeps and Arabians we do hear them speak boy what a what a sermon cuz what would have happened if Paul if Peter would have had stood out there and said it in every one of these languages or like brother Brown said he would go overseas and he' been he'd be in Africa and he'd say God bless you and it'd be 14 different people would have to say God bless you and and there in the another language but God made sure he got this message right through Peter and just change their hearing he that have a ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church so this church was what born by the Breath of God we already covered this oh did you get it the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed breath into the nostril spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul did you know the Pentecostals are look he said the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God so guess what in the end time brother Ram had to preach and tell us that we were born by the Breath of God all right not by a man Pentecost meaning the 50th day or harvest feast or Feast of Wheats may be regarded as a supplement to the Passover it lasted for about one day from the 16th of Nissen seven weeks were reckoned inclusively and the next or 50th day was the day of Pentecost to make all that clear there was a there was a jubilee ever seven years right according to Leviticus 258 but when you come to that seven sevens when you come seven cycles of that seven year period you had a day you had a day that everything that was your golden jubilee all right or the day of pente cost it lasted for a day it was the 50th day was the day of Pentecost which fell on the 6th of s it tells you when it is the Pentecost was the Jewish Harvest home and the people were especially exhorted to Rejoice before Jehovah with their families their servants the levit so it was a big celebration it wasn't just like I'm going to just plot my 120 and out here in the woods somewhere and y'all going to receive the Holy Ghost he showed it to the whole world without seeing in and fox let me put them on both end but he had everybody there in position and what those that got the Holy Ghost what' they do they went back home oh yeah they took the Holy Ghost back home with them amen let's try that sometime take the Holy Ghost back home with them and then they noise did abroad and people receive the Holy Ghost after that God's word will never fail God will never be stopped acts 2:32 this Jesus hath God raised up it's say Peter where of all we Are Witnesses and we'll stop right here therefore being by the right hand of God exalted now look I I'll show you this this afternoon being on the right hand of God which is his father's Throne or power but he is in a Corporal body and he has to stay in this Dimension cuz you're his body so he stays over here but what does he do he doesn't just sit there and sleep he sends the Holy Ghost back on the day of Pentecost same person in a different dispensation he sends them and gives them the power having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which you now see in here for David has not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the Lord Lord sent unto my Lord sit th on my right hand until I make thy fo foes thy foot stols therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly boy Peter's preaching a powerful 20 minute sermon that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent we forget that part repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises un to you and to your children to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call thank God he said that cuz that's us and with many other words did he testify and exort saying save yourself from this wicked or UNT generation then they received and baptized same day they were added 3,000 Souls people were BT 3,000 people were baptized and they continued steadfast look first church Foundation First Church they continued steadfast in the apostles Doctrine didn't say Jesus's Doctrine because they were Christians and they preached what Christ said so they didn't differentiate they didn't say oh they said no this is the apostles Doctrine but it's what Jesus said and fellowship and breaking of bread and in prayer now Peter on the day of Pentecost he was given the keys to the kingdom we find that he opened it to the Jews on the day of Pentecost went down to Samaritan and opened up again so they they sent up for him who Peter they had the keys and he laid his hand upon them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them now we Gentiles we were heathens Romans Greeks and so forth we worshiped Idols we weren't looking for a messiah we had no time for messiah we had our own Gods our forefathers but the Jews were looking for a messiah so when the Samaritans because they were half Jew so was the Samaritans cuz they were half to and Gentile we'll stop right here now Jesus will appear to those who are looking for him Jesus will appear how profound is that quote Jesus will appear to those who are looking for him only those that's all he is not obligated to the unbeliever but to the believer he is obligated he is obligated to raise the believer up see in the last day only the believer let's stand our feet only obligated to a Believer he is not obligated oh he's a good god somebody was preaching the other day and uh we call Jesus the prince of peace Mighty conqueror all these great things oh Jesus you know he's he's just a Meek mile guy he's comforting and that's what he's going to make you Jesus tells us he said I didn't come to bring peace but a sword he said husband will be against wife wife will be against husband mother-in-law again he knew that as the church AE Messengers that he was going to be in he knew that once he sounded his message there would be a war and listen when you have a war what you got to do first first thing you got to do pick a side cuz there's two that's why they're Waring you got to pick a side today you got to you can't be neutral you got to pick one of the other right you might in another Army you might be one of them secret centers or something but no you got to pick a side God's army or the devil's Army one of the two and that's what he did on the day of Pentecost that's what God said he said I come to bring a sword I am the Prince of Peace he'll put peace in your heart but he'll also turn people against you he knew that that's why he said what he did and what about this before we close this great pen of Peace this mild mannered Man From Galilee he was sitting eating one day and there was a sarian woman sitting over here a little away from him she wasn't a Jew she said oh son of David have mercy my my daughter needs he said you're a dog only thing he did was knew that she wasn't a Jew that's all come on brother Bob's message was cutting today mine was maybe a little bit but Jesus looked at her and said you are a dog Jesus said this to the lady now the lady could have said like some other people bless God I ain't going back to that church no more that man called me a dog right no you know what she said she said oh I just need the scraps off of your table there's something different about you sir I may not be a Jew but when he said she said my Lord it connected she got what she asked for she didn't care whether he called him a dog called her a dog or not he looked at those people and and even called Peter the devil that's right say get behind me he was looking over Peter he looking right at him right he went to the temple and he talked to some preachers had a had a Minister's meeting had a Minister's meeting and at The Minister's meeting he said you Snakes in the Grass you vipers you're a son of the devil ain't that what he said now oh no he didn't say that well he said I'm of my father and you of yours they weren't the same so it had to be the devil or God he called him devil said you're you're come straight from the devil your daddy Satan of course they killed him but that s phenician woman said just as we should say Lord whatever it is just give us a scrap I'm not worthy I I'm not not worthy to do this because of all the stuff I got piled up and he may have called us a dog at one time but he gave her what she needed she got what she needed needed cuz she stayed there she didn't get all huffy up and bless God I ain't going back to that church no more brother Bob tell me I can't sleep in I anyway listen it's our desire it really is it's your desire it's what's going to take us out of here is a desire that we have for God
