[22:05] there's a promise to our children
[22:09] the same one he's given
[22:19] no failure is final
[22:23] when god extends his grace
[22:27] but until then just speak

[22:42] know that there's a victory down the
[22:45] road
[23:02] they're working on their testimony
[23:09] you're working on the testimony
[23:46] get everybody up
[23:50] you're supposed to have a special horse
[23:51] come on
[24:38] well i was on a mountain
[24:41] one drink from the fountain
[24:44] when
[24:58] you can see
[25:07] me
[25:14] to this message
[25:36] my glory
[26:06] and when i see him
[26:14] me
[26:24] all around me
[26:52] me
[27:11] my glory
[27:30] razor
[27:47] and we were up in jeffersonville indiana
[27:49] uh years ago probably somewhere about 78
[27:52] and they had told that they had this
[27:54] uh
[27:55] barge of some kind of gas that that got
[27:58] grounded under the river right there and
[27:59] they were afraid it was going to explode
[28:01] so they told everybody not to have
[28:02] services and they'd come down and told
[28:04] them you know not to have any services
[28:06] and bill paul got said well don't worry
[28:08] about it said if that thing goes off
[28:11] said you'll see the biggest pillar of
[28:13] clouds you've ever seen in your life
[28:14] because the bride is going to beat it up
[28:19] good to see everybody we have a lot of
[28:21] people here today so let's get right on
[28:22] in with it we have a brother from
[28:25] uh haiti that's come over today and i'll
[28:28] just introduce him with brother mario
[28:30] and he and his son is your wish but
[28:32] brother if you will come up and greet
[28:34] the people
[28:48] hey
[29:01] you know this is the reason why god
[29:03] created you that's right you have to
[29:05] give him praise
[29:06] this is the reason you're here tonight
[29:08] give him praise are you here tonight not
[29:11] to be
[29:12] here to assist in the service you are
[29:15] here to do the service for the lord
[29:16] right amen
[29:18] amen because the pews cannot do the
[29:20] service the building cannot do the
[29:22] service because the building is not the
[29:24] church because we are the church
[29:27] he's waiting on us to please him the
[29:30] only reason you're here just to give him
[29:32] praise
[29:43] because the word of god said in the
[29:45] beginning was the word and the word make
[29:47] it flesh because then what is you today
[29:49] because the one is in you because god's
[29:52] spoken god spoken the word and then what
[29:55] got spoken turned to be a human being
[29:57] that even was jesus and everything god
[30:00] was was in jesus and everything jesus
[30:02] was was in you right so there's no
[30:04] reason to be sad there's no reason you
[30:06] don't have affliction today
[30:08] be happy no matter what it is because
[30:11] i'm from haiti because in haiti these
[30:13] days because i have brother thomas in
[30:16] haiti with me and by the dale world was
[30:18] in haiti
[30:19] and then if you see exactly the
[30:21] condition we're living in if you see
[30:23] exactly how you're sitting comfortably
[30:25] here and how we sat over there and
[30:27] that's there's no comparison
[30:29] we don't have to compare because we
[30:31] don't have a building we are taught we
[30:33] have really tense come on
[30:49] states hallelujah not they go to china
[30:51] if they go to haiti
[30:54] that's the way you have to keep it yeah
[30:55] keep it right there and you'll be all
[30:57] right but you heard about six o'clock
[30:59] that'll be a rapture it doesn't matter
[31:01] yeah the morning set we're ready
[31:10] would be happy to go to meet their
[31:11] husband then i'm happy to go to
[31:13] manhattan so amen i've been greeting
[31:16] from our brothers and sisters in haiti
[31:18] uh they pray for you and they ask me to
[31:21] greet you wherever i go
[31:22] because we're here in a mission
[31:24] because i'm a missionary in haiti go to
[31:26] different top of the mountain to the
[31:28] valley go to different places and meet
[31:31] our brothers and sisters but if you
[31:33] could see
[31:34] how the condition they are worshiping
[31:36] the lord and we have
[31:38] i'm not going to be wrong because when
[31:40] the earthquake last year was struck in
[31:43] haiti and we have one of our church that
[31:46] my brothers was praying
[31:48] and the other one they are having
[31:50] service but they brought the building
[31:52] crumble on them
[31:54] and some of them get out but we have it
[31:55] was under the rumble
[31:57] and then after that when though the
[31:59] brothers came
[32:00] and said is there anybody
[32:02] inside they heard they said yes
[32:04] and they
[32:05] managed
[32:06] to push their wrong boutique places and
[32:09] to get all them out when they got out
[32:11] safe in the name
[32:23] god the preacher was preaching
[32:25] because in haiti we don't have
[32:27] electricity in different different parts
[32:30] but we have to do service at three or
[32:32] four o'clock in the afternoon or four
[32:34] o'clock to six o'clock and the
[32:36] earthquake starts about five o'clock so
[32:38] that's when everybody knows it was in
[32:40] church
[32:40] during the earthquake most of them
[32:42] because at the time we have services and
[32:44] then
[32:45] they look at the building open up
[32:47] and then all those other buildings
[32:49] around the church building church all of
[32:51] them crumble
[32:53] i don't think we have that on video but
[32:55] we have that and all the other meeting
[32:57] crumble but the building was open and
[32:59] then
[33:00] it's come back again that's this
[33:02] testimony we have from there
[33:04] and god served him everything has
[33:06] cracked all of her places need to be
[33:07] replaced but god save them and they are
[33:10] very grateful for what god has done
[33:13] there will be peace with the goddess
[33:22] he doesn't need to consult any other
[33:24] person he doesn't need to consult any
[33:26] other ones that you know what to do and
[33:28] i'm glad god did something from the
[33:31] first time at the very beginning and his
[33:33] thought was right he never changed his
[33:36] thoughts
[33:36] god said he's going to create you to be
[33:38] here tonight that was before the
[33:40] foundation of the world look at you
[33:42] you're here tonight

[34:02] thank the brothers and sisters that
[34:04] receive me here i'm telling you this oh

[34:28] me feel at home
[34:41] let's just get on started come on
[34:42] brother tom you're up on the front
[34:44] and reach people
[34:50] god bless you all i'm so happy to be
[34:52] here
[34:53] we had a little flat tire on the way but
[34:55] that was all right
[34:58] we changed it we had all the brothers
[34:59] changing there's like a
[35:01] speed change so that worked out good
[35:03] i'm so very happy to be here today i
[35:05] love the lord with all my heart
[35:07] i'm glad you got to hear brother mario's
[35:09] testimony yeah
[35:11] one of the testimonies of the church
[35:13] that made it was a two-story building
[35:15] right next to it actually fell over onto
[35:18] that church building and the believers
[35:19] were inside and began to cry out and
[35:21] that building righted itself it went
[35:24] directly down
[35:25] and all the believers inside the
[35:27] building were just as white as chalk
[35:28] because of
[35:29] all the rubble
[35:31] and
[35:32] i really i just got back this monday or
[35:35] tuesday morning excuse me and we had a
[35:37] great time in haiti the believers are
[35:39] tremendous
[35:40] it is the same spirit it is uh it is
[35:43] amazing to me that whale and haiti
[35:46] uh poorest country in the world right
[35:48] now but you just look at the believers
[35:51] and they have such order and such love
[35:53] for the lord
[35:54] but beyond those doors of that church it
[35:56] is nothing but a wild wild west
[35:59] it is a very dangerous place it is very
[36:02] ungodly place it is very fast action
[36:04] place and uh but you know it's just
[36:07] amazing what the message is
[36:09] i just can't help but saying i know it's
[36:11] a little bit of a worldly thing but the
[36:12] message rules
[36:15] it just rules it's the most powerful
[36:17] thing to ever hit this earth
[36:20] and to see people who have made such bad
[36:22] and poor decisions in haiti
[36:24] plus combine it with a major earthquake
[36:27] and there's just rubble everywhere and
[36:29] traffic's everywhere and uh you just you
[36:32] just look is there any sanity left and
[36:34] it's so ungodly and
[36:36] and the way they dress the sisters is
[36:38] that women excuse me especially and then
[36:41] you just you go into all that and wonder
[36:43] if you can even make it and you step
[36:45] through the doors of a beautiful tent
[36:49] or a little building that made it and
[36:50] it's just entering into a different
[36:52] world and i just cried like a baby i
[36:53] felt like i was at home
[36:55] and i just love the lord with all my
[36:57] heart there's lots happening in the
[36:58] message of the hour
[37:01] god sent a prophet that prophet was to
[37:03] deliver a word and that word landed
[37:05] right in the hearts of the true
[37:06] believers now those believers are lit on

[1:00:32] gainesville
[1:00:34] probably four years ago when we begin in
[1:00:37] there
[1:00:38] and uh to me it's a
[1:00:40] big experience to
[1:00:43] the classroom
[1:00:45] when we started to preaching you know
[1:00:47] i remember when my father
[1:00:50] many years ago told me then
[1:00:52] one day i died
[1:00:55] and there was an
[1:00:57] assistant to
[1:01:00] a pentecostal church
[1:01:02] and
[1:01:03] my father said
[1:01:05] when
[1:01:07] when i died they called some brothers to
[1:01:13] to pray for me
[1:01:15] and one brother says
[1:01:18] when he came
[1:01:20] and said hey brother samuel don't worry
[1:01:22] about it you don't die because
[1:01:25] the lord needs you for something
[1:01:29] well i don't understand nothing because
[1:01:31] you know
[1:01:32] it's
[1:01:33] a support testimony for me when i was
[1:01:35] child
[1:01:36] but uh now
[1:01:38] then i'm i'm preaching right i remember
[1:01:41] all the time

[1:01:46] that broad says
[1:01:48] let's pray
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:51] i will pray
[1:01:53] and i'm pretty sure that he will raise
[1:01:55] from the dead all right
[1:01:57] and my father says when
[1:01:59] he finished the pray
[1:02:00] i wish to stand like this looking for me
[1:02:14] and
[1:02:15] when i meet brother samuel dell

[1:02:20] the love of god

[1:10:31] my troubles
[1:11:23] my troubles
[1:11:44] yes
[1:12:04] amen
[1:12:27] i was thinking about what the prophet
[1:12:28] said
[1:12:30] about uh
[1:12:31] the roman soldier
[1:12:34] that when jesus was brought forth
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:39] you know he was crucified
[1:12:41] and he was hanging on the tree there
[1:12:44] but a roman soldier was
[1:12:46] having a very
[1:12:48] you know
[1:12:49] a deadly spear
[1:12:52] the brother go call it
[1:12:54] a sin spear
[1:12:56] so he came and
[1:12:57] he struggled inside of jesus christ
[1:13:00] and i see the results of it today amen
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:04] the spirit of god
[1:13:06] when the spirit was used
[1:13:09] i think the man
[1:13:10] stabbed the side of jesus so hard
[1:13:13] and then the blood of jesus god shouted
[1:13:15] and began to spray what that's what the
[1:13:17] prophet said and he said the blood began
[1:13:19] to go shh
[1:13:21] and you see
[1:13:22] some of the blood went to heaven
[1:13:27] amen
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:30] and you see all over the world nigeria
[1:13:32] and god is
[1:13:34] calling everybody
[1:13:36] amen amen there's power in the blood of
[1:13:39] jesus
[1:13:40] and i i was
[1:13:43] praying
[1:13:44] uh god gave me a scripture in first king
[1:13:47] chapter three
[1:13:48] and i read it because i've been reading
[1:13:50] that scripture since
[1:13:52] when i was a little boy
[1:13:54] and um
[1:13:55] by the women the two women with a dead
[1:13:58] child and living in childhood came
[1:14:00] before solomon
[1:14:01] and
[1:14:02] when they came with it with a living
[1:14:04] child not a dead child amen
[1:14:07] the
[1:14:08] no witness at all
[1:14:09] and i said lord what does it mean in
[1:14:11] this scripture all right jesus i prayed
[1:14:14] for god to open it up for me more on
[1:14:17] monday
[1:14:19] and this morning i open it up again and
[1:14:21] i see the spirit of god
[1:14:23] come down and open it up even more
[1:14:26] i see exactly what it probably said
[1:14:28] about the two churches
[1:14:30] the
[1:14:31] the natural church the common church and
[1:14:34] the spiritual i see these two women
[1:14:37] all of them
[1:14:39] all of them were sins
[1:14:41] amen the bible says it will help stay
[1:14:42] amen yeah and
[1:14:44] these two before a great king
[1:14:47] and this cain had a discernment
[1:14:50] amen yeah right from the face of the
[1:14:53] problem you could have just said this
[1:14:56] baby belongs
[1:14:58] but he said bring me the sword
[1:15:01] amen so i believe that this is a time
[1:15:04] that the king is using the sword
[1:15:06] and this sword is a word
[1:15:08] and it's
[1:15:11] and um
[1:15:12] as the spirit of god was
[1:15:14] even giving me more understanding
[1:15:17] i see
[1:15:18] this woman the first woman
[1:15:21] the bible said
[1:15:22] she overlaid on her child
[1:15:26] amen was she alive
[1:15:28] yeah amen
[1:15:29] she concluded it beautiful story and
[1:15:32] gave it but that was a lie and you see
[1:15:35] the denominational lies
[1:15:38] all different planes even though
[1:15:40] i know girl can come anytime

[1:15:54] whatever churches they also celebrating

[1:46:54] they've been real friends

[1:47:03] brother brother sam being a real friend
[1:47:06] he's a real father image
[1:47:08] and you've been around here just like i
[1:47:10] never had a father so when i see
[1:47:12] somebody that got that kind of anointing
[1:47:14] i really respect it he's a real father
[1:47:17] not only that he's a pastor so i
[1:47:19] appreciate him giving this opportunity
[1:47:21] to be here i got a lot of great
[1:47:23] preachers here man
[1:47:24] i hear brother holmes
[1:47:27] and after his you know he really i can
[1:47:30] tell he was ready to get started i said
[1:47:32] don't let him preach
[1:47:47] and i appreciate my wife being with me
[1:47:49] this
[1:47:50] the day is her birthday she spent a
[1:47:52] birthday so
[1:47:53] she asked me
[1:48:00] hopefully maybe in the morning i have a
[1:48:03] sing a song for you to praise god but
[1:48:05] i'm not going to keep you you know my
[1:48:07] style
[1:48:08] they call me the helicopter preacher
[1:48:11] and if you get that tighter you got to
[1:48:13] live up to it
[1:48:15] so when i get ready to stop i'm gonna go
[1:48:17] up when i come down i'm just gonna come
[1:48:19] down and stop so you'd be just like to
[1:48:22] say hang on for the ride i told the
[1:48:24] other night i'll preach behind a pastor
[1:48:26] i said pastor's airplane
[1:48:29] he need a runway to get going and i said
[1:48:32] you know when
[1:48:33] the difference between the helicopter
[1:48:35] and the airplane the the airplane had to
[1:48:37] get per minima of buildup or a build up
[1:48:40] speed to take it off the ground i think
[1:48:42] 170 miles an hour they take the lift of
[1:48:45] 747 off the ground
[1:48:47] and
[1:48:48] and when it
[1:48:49] he had to get that speed up and then
[1:48:51] when he get ready to land our airplane
[1:48:53] had to break the speed
[1:48:55] he had to pull they had to break it back
[1:48:57] so that they could land the plane i say
[1:48:59] that when you're bouncing preaching you
[1:49:01] think when he gonna land
[1:49:05] you see him coming in but he ain't
[1:49:06] landing yet
[1:49:08] but a helicopter
[1:49:11] it goes up with the same amount of speed
[1:49:14] that the helicopter go up where it lands
[1:49:15] with the same amount as me they don't
[1:49:17] have to break the speed to land so when
[1:49:19] i when i get ready and i'm just gonna
[1:49:21] land
[1:49:23] so if you got your bibles this evening
[1:49:26] i'm gonna go to the word of god and i'll
[1:49:28] read from the book of saint john
[1:49:30] the 15th chapter and i'm gonna read from
[1:49:32] the book of first john
[1:49:34] the second chapter

[1:49:44] down through verse seven
[1:49:46] saint john the fifteenth chapter verse

[1:50:47] cast them into the fire and they are
[1:50:49] burnt

[1:50:54] you
[1:50:55] yeah ask what you will
[1:50:58] and it shall be done
[1:51:00] unto you
[1:51:02] let us go to first john
[1:51:04] the back of the bible
[1:51:06] to the second
[1:51:08] chapter
[1:51:10] in first john
[1:51:13] the second chapter
[1:51:16] i'm going to read a verse from there
[1:51:19] i'm going to read from verse 27
[1:51:22] it says
[1:51:24] ii chapter first john verse 27
[1:51:27] but the anointing which you have
[1:51:29] received of him
[1:51:32] abided work in you
[1:51:35] show you in other words abide in you and
[1:51:37] you ain't need nothing that any man
[1:51:40] teach you right but as that same
[1:51:43] anointing teach you all things
[1:51:46] and it is true and is no lie
[1:51:50] even as it has taught you
[1:51:53] you shall abide
[1:51:56] in
[1:51:57] him amen
[1:51:59] a gracious father
[1:52:01] one more time
[1:52:03] help me to yield my mind my body my
[1:52:06] spirit to you god my soul
[1:52:08] father help me to surrender myself
[1:52:10] completely over to your spirit yes lord
[1:52:12] of god as you go after these few minutes
[1:52:15] god give us grace and mercy to speak
[1:52:17] your word father yes
[1:52:19] now father god touch someone that need
[1:52:21] touch
[1:52:22] heal someone that needs healing god
[1:52:24] break a depression any spirit that will
[1:52:26] try to bind a whole
[1:52:29] we ask you in the name of jesus christ
[1:52:31] to take full control of this service we
[1:52:34] actually in the name of our lord jesus
[1:52:36] christ amen
[1:52:38] you may be seated one moment
[1:52:43] thank the lord for the reading of the
[1:52:45] word of god deceiving you amen
[1:52:47] amen
[1:52:48] if you ain't abiding in me
[1:52:51] he said am i worried about it in you
[1:52:54] ask what you will
[1:52:56] how did it shall
[1:52:58] and if i had a title i would use this
[1:53:01] title this uh evening
[1:53:03] abiding in the realm of anointing all
[1:53:06] right right about it in the realm of
[1:53:08] anointing because we realize that in the
[1:53:10] book of first john and the second
[1:53:13] chapter said i need it it needs nothing
[1:53:15] any man teach you right now i mean where
[1:53:18] is the anointing that god sent to teach
[1:53:20] you how many numbers not only will this
[1:53:22] anointing how did it be on you but he
[1:53:24] said it will be in you honey so we begin
[1:53:27] to look at these things so we got to
[1:53:29] begin to really abide
[1:53:31] in the anointing uh i find it in the
[1:53:34] realm of anointing what do you abide me
[1:53:36] it means to contain it means to dwell it
[1:53:40] means to him do it it means to stand
[1:53:44] and in a way if god is in me
[1:53:47] i will endure i do i will be able to
[1:53:50] stand
[1:53:51] it because there will be a continue
[1:54:05] that we abide in the anointing of god
[1:54:08] how did we go we realized here what did
[1:54:10] the brother come to do he come to bring
[1:54:12] us back to the word
[1:54:14] so we can find our place where we come
[1:54:16] from how do you know the word we got to
[1:54:18] know what kind of lord in this ownership
[1:54:33] here
[1:54:34] he says here he says
[1:54:36] he's in the church his head
[1:54:38] he's in it the church is heading himself
[1:54:41] up with the word because he can not only
[1:54:44] he only come to the word
[1:54:46] he is the word
[1:54:48] the word cannot
[1:54:50] the word cannot come to a
[1:54:54] alone whatever the word is
[1:54:56] if it won't fit so the word has to come
[1:54:59] to the word yet abide in me and my words
[1:55:02] in you man should not live about bread
[1:55:05] alone another quote here for the world
[1:55:08] is falling apart he just he said when we
[1:55:11] get get away from the word then we'll
[1:55:14] we're getting away from god jesus said
[1:55:16] if you abide in me he said that is the
[1:55:19] mystery i need another word he was
[1:55:22] trying to get the people to see it ain't
[1:55:24] about how good you are and he's about
[1:55:27] how much power you got it's in the world
[1:55:39] and my words and you didn't didn't ask
[1:55:42] what you will see see it
[1:55:45] see the idea is god's word has got to be
[1:55:49] abiding here so he would tell them that
[1:55:51] the word how did he say if the word
[1:55:54] abide in you
[1:55:55] and if you abide in the word
[1:55:58] he said then you can
[1:56:27] because he says here that is the secret
[1:56:29] how do you deal with the power lace
[1:56:32] honey when you find out what you ain't
[1:56:33] in the word that would give you
[1:56:35] authority over the devil because jesus
[1:56:37] knew his position in the word
[1:56:40] he knew his position in the word and
[1:56:42] because he knew his position in the word
[1:56:44] he had power over the devil
[1:56:50] in other words
[1:56:52] how do we know when we abide in god
[1:56:55] the point of it is the thing that is
[1:56:57] ordered abide in god you gotta have the
[1:57:00] ability to hear the word
[1:57:03] first of all it's starting with the
[1:57:04] ability to hear the word how did
[1:57:07] everybody come to church everybody ever
[1:57:09] heard the message don't mean they heard
[1:57:10] the word
[1:57:14] amen yeah the ability to hear the word
[1:57:17] so that abiding is based on
[1:57:20] the ability to hear the word
[1:57:22] and then the only way you can hear the
[1:57:23] word you got to be a spirit-filled man
[1:57:26] he said right here in the midst
[1:57:28] of it he's the worst in faith expressing
[1:57:30] he said now he begin to
[1:57:32] i got the wrong one excuse me i'm sorry
[1:57:35] yeah he said right here
[1:57:37] in the messenger in the surrounding
[1:57:39] my test uh saw this church in he said
[1:57:42] he's an evil edge
[1:57:44] he's an average we he's a to every age
[1:57:49] we hear the same truth right he that has
[1:57:52] an error
[1:57:53] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[1:57:55] to the churches
[1:57:57] but only a spirit-filled man
[1:58:00] can't hear the revelation of that
[1:58:03] it ain't just hearing the magic it ain't
[1:58:04] just hear somebody say jesus
[1:58:07] but somebody they gotta anoint you to
[1:58:10] recognize what god is doing
[1:58:12] for this day you know what we say here i
[1:58:15] i hear i've been hearing the saying
[1:58:16] about it hey god predicted that rapture
[1:58:19] to take place
[1:58:20] about six o'clock and i'm gonna tell my
[1:58:22] friend it's already wrong the rapture
[1:58:24] already took place honey how did
[1:58:26] something on the inside of you when you
[1:58:28] recognize this word get eagle food how
[1:58:31] did you already
[1:58:47] part of what god you're a part of god
[1:58:49] planned
[1:58:50] how many shall we we must have our earth
[1:58:52] in here amen yeah now see when i say it
[1:58:55] everyone can't hear them
[1:58:57] i'm gonna bag that about scripture
[1:58:59] and you know what you said brother
[1:59:14] became a new book he was able to take
[1:59:16] this bible and find himself in it
[1:59:21] you can't find yourself in the word of
[1:59:23] god
[1:59:25] so we got to look at here i see the
[1:59:27] ability to hear
[1:59:28] you've got to have the ability to hear
[1:59:30] the word
[1:59:32] in order to abide in him that means to
[1:59:34] continue continue holy know how you're
[1:59:37] not going to let go the world is
[1:59:39] continuing dwelling in me i don't care
[1:59:41] what the devil tried to say i don't care
[1:59:44] what kevin sugar said i'm up again the
[1:59:46] word will never leave you over save you
[1:59:49] it will never take you nowhere it cannot
[1:59:51] keep you i am abiding
[1:59:55] amen
[2:00:11] hey just look at this thing right here
[2:00:14] i'm never going to read a few verses
[2:00:15] here
[2:00:16] i'm not going to be long today i'm going
[2:00:17] to sell you anything i'm going to
[2:00:18] parachute out
[2:00:19] so here
[2:00:21] so here we go john 6
[2:00:23] and i'm going to begin reading it saint
[2:00:25] john 6 and i'm going to begin reading
[2:00:27] that verse 65 saint john verse 65
[2:00:30] and he began to hear the same time and
[2:00:32] we know the stone right here over jesus
[2:00:34] speaking to the disciple i was
[2:00:36] unbelievable but at the 65th verse jesus
[2:00:38] said like
[2:00:39] the 65th verse he said he said and and
[2:00:42] he said therefore i say unto you that
[2:00:45] what
[2:00:46] no man can come unto me except he was
[2:00:49] giving up him all about what
[2:00:52] happened
[2:01:20] sometimes we come across revelation we
[2:01:23] might not understand it but we don't
[2:01:25] give up we don't quit on god we don't
[2:01:27] turn back on god when we look at things
[2:01:29] and see like it ain't going the way that
[2:01:31] we thought it ought to go i still hold
[2:01:33] on to the word
[2:01:39] and the world is falling apart i don't
[2:01:41] understand it but i know that god is
[2:01:44] real yeah
[2:02:02] and he said what he said from that time
[2:02:05] that's right how did he quit about it
[2:02:08] from that time something stopped there
[2:02:11] from continuing on something stop never
[2:02:14] going all the way with god
[2:02:24] if you can explain it you don't need
[2:02:26] faith
[2:02:27] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[2:02:29] it must be revealed to you how did
[2:02:36] many of his disciples walked back
[2:02:39] however what it is he said my spirit has
[2:02:41] no pleasure in them to draw back here he
[2:02:44] was going forward abiding in the word
[2:02:47] honey but the word came how did the word
[2:02:49] begin to reveal itself and they did not
[2:02:52] keep following the word they did not
[2:02:54] keep us abiding in the word they turned
[2:02:57] from the word and walked backwards
[2:02:59] steady going forward other people god
[2:03:01] did not call up the banker he called us
[2:03:04] to keep pressing up he calling to take
[2:03:07] the land how many people are gonna tying
[2:03:09] the bag up and the time to make them
[2:03:11] feel violent i'm gonna go all the way
[2:03:13] with god honey he says from that time
[2:03:16] right now yeah
[2:03:18] why must have been time creatures
[2:03:22] they must have been dwelling in time all
[2:03:24] right because here's a lot of them with
[2:03:26] time from that time
[2:03:28] honey they must have had a plan that
[2:03:30] they were going to be removed from the
[2:03:32] book right
[2:03:33] from that time they might have been
[2:03:35] going to church praying in god and
[2:03:37] having a good time but something
[2:03:39] separated them
[2:03:40] it was not because they were drinking
[2:03:42] bubbles and shooting drugs once every
[2:03:44] day they could not stay with the word
[2:03:48] they could not stay with the word
[2:03:50] he said from that time
[2:03:52] many of the disciples went back
[2:03:55] and walked no more
[2:03:57] with him
[2:03:58] in other words god scrapped the name of
[2:04:00] the book
[2:04:02] they just happened to be saint john 666
[2:04:06] they just happened to follow him
[2:04:08] if you
[2:04:23] yeah
[2:04:24] 67 yes 67 bro jesus said that to them
[2:04:27] will you also go right oh man that's
[2:04:30] abiding in the word now
[2:04:32] how you are being the god of words down
[2:04:34] on the inside of him
[2:04:36] he's not going to let go how did he not
[2:04:39] gonna back up and then and then he said
[2:04:41] right here and then simon peter ever
[2:04:44] said lord
[2:04:46] how he called him by his right title
[2:04:48] lord why because the lord is my shepherd
[2:04:51] i shall not walk i need god god has
[2:04:53] sacrificed from my heart i the lord is
[2:04:55] in protection other people say lord
[2:04:58] yes when that name is always really
[2:05:01] mentioned in the bible and always get
[2:05:03] jesus attention
[2:05:19] to whom
[2:05:21] shall we go
[2:05:22] that has the worst
[2:05:24] of eternal life
[2:05:26] honey i don't tell you what i'm gonna
[2:05:28] stay with this i'm gonna hold on to what
[2:05:30] your word said i don't understand it
[2:05:33] neither but i know one thing you ought
[2:05:35] to live in word how did he say it very
[2:05:38] good peter said not only this i'm not
[2:05:40] just serving this thing because i read
[2:05:42] about it or because somebody talked
[2:05:44] about it but he sounds in this thing
[2:05:46] because i know this is real yeah amen
[2:05:49] and then he says right in the 20 to 69
[2:05:52] verse and we believe
[2:05:54] and are sure amen
[2:05:56] if you ain't sure you ain't going to
[2:05:58] keep a body
[2:06:00] when you're not
[2:06:15] and let it keep abiding in me i mean i
[2:06:17] ever gonna be i receive a new body i
[2:06:20] gotta believe it
[2:06:23] and we are sure that the other christ
[2:06:25] the son of the living god and jesus
[2:06:40] jesus knew who he was
[2:06:54] before you could ever go backwards do
[2:06:57] you got to lead the world how did what
[2:06:59] did he do adam's he told adam to stay
[2:07:01] with the word
[2:07:03] abide in the word if adam would have
[2:07:05] stayed with the word deity was in him
[2:07:07] hallelujah as long as adam stayed with
[2:07:09] the word he could say to this mountain
[2:07:11] to me that i moved and the mountain had
[2:07:13] to obey him how did the most he stay
[2:07:15] with the world he could speak squirreled
[2:07:17] into existence
[2:07:18] lord he stayed with the word god had the
[2:07:21] power in him
[2:07:22] but he couldn't give he he didn't work
[2:07:24] something turned him away from the word
[2:07:27] yeah and when he did it he's lost his
[2:07:29] ability
[2:07:31] no longer could he do these things again
[2:07:33] how do you know why you're the father
[2:07:35] being the rapture
[2:07:38] joshua did not receive power because he
[2:07:41] was a good man
[2:07:43] joshua's received power because he
[2:07:45] stayed with the world
[2:07:47] he took the prophet message and put sin
[2:07:50] on it
[2:07:51] he took the message and put it behind
[2:07:56] when he called joshua
[2:07:59] he said these things he said judging one
[2:08:02] says him he said foot and the eighth
[2:08:05] verse said the book of the law
[2:08:07] shall not depart from work that's right
[2:08:10] i've got mouth yeah i need the word of
[2:08:12] god and not unto thy mouth
[2:08:15] out of your own mouth you speak life or
[2:08:18] you speak down right i mean out in your
[2:08:20] own
[2:08:35] in the holy ghost he wants you to walk
[2:08:36] around and talk about all your weary and
[2:08:38] all your complaining and every time that
[2:08:40] that will do something to you he wants
[2:08:41] you to go around oh wow
[2:08:44] yeah oh the devil down this street and
[2:08:46] the devil why you don't want you to get
[2:08:48] that word on this side of you i'm not
[2:08:51] gonna let the devil turn me back i'm not
[2:08:53] gonna let the devil make me give up i'm
[2:08:55] gonna stay in that word received
[2:09:30] to do to do according to all that is
[2:09:34] written
[2:09:35] therein
[2:09:37] and
[2:09:38] therein
[2:09:39] for then
[2:09:40] thou shalt make thy way prosperous
[2:09:43] and thy shall
[2:09:45] die shall have good success
[2:09:48] amen have not i command thee
[2:09:51] be strong and have a good courage yeah
[2:09:55] be not afraid
[2:09:57] amen you need to be
[2:09:58] dismayed
[2:10:00] for the lord not god is with thee
[2:10:02] whatsoever
[2:10:05] the power was standing in the word the
[2:10:08] power was standing in the book
[2:10:10] of power repeat the book joshua has it
[2:10:14] and keep speaking the word until you
[2:10:16] overcome this deal
[2:10:18] i'm calling you for this job hey yeah he
[2:10:20] said well i'm going i'm in this mission
[2:10:22] and everything's going wrong hey you
[2:10:23] managed to get back to the world because
[2:10:26] i would make your way possible i live in
[2:10:29] another world whenever things is going

[2:11:07] we're going to abide with god and then
[2:11:09] we're going to stay with the word we got
[2:11:11] to completely surrender ourselves to it

[2:11:30] more you decrease the more that he could
[2:11:32] increase
[2:11:36] oh yeah
[2:11:51] the surrendering paul we got to come to
[2:11:52] that point people
[2:11:54] we've got to surrender everything that
[2:11:55] we got to god we got this word say about
[2:11:58] that he would abide and we abide in his
[2:12:01] word and his word abide in us if we ask
[2:12:03] what we will
[2:12:04] honey
[2:12:12] god through him
[2:12:13] he was so
[2:12:14] completely

[2:12:18] he was so completely to surrender to the
[2:12:20] word
[2:12:21] and god
[2:12:23] of god until he
[2:12:25] and the word was the same
[2:12:28] that exactly what the church ought to be

[2:13:38] would it be out of abraham
[2:13:40] but they couldn't stay with the word
[2:13:42] right how do you know what was wrong
[2:13:44] they could not hear

[2:14:19] bible because when i got this when the
[2:14:21] seals over my life would become a new
[2:14:23] book

[2:15:21] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[2:15:24] make you free

[2:15:29] should know the truth
[2:15:32] amen
[2:15:49] i said that that your make us free
[2:15:52] and jesus after they said that said unto
[2:15:54] them i say unto you
[2:15:56] whosoever sinned is is the servant of
[2:15:59] satan if ye are in a servant body
[2:16:03] right how does the servant body not
[2:16:06] right honey god servant can be moved a
[2:16:09] servant he don't know what's going on in
[2:16:11] the bride chamber he's going to serve
[2:16:13] everybody not in the house but forever
[2:16:16] but the son of fighting
[2:16:20] foreign wait what happened i'm going to
[2:16:23] be identified with my father hallelujah
[2:16:26] i stayed up in that wreath and ruler i
[2:16:29] mean now i'm part of the part
[2:16:38] there was something on the inside of him
[2:16:39] they could call him back to hear the
[2:16:41] word of god hallelujah was something on
[2:16:43] the inside of him even though he went
[2:16:45] down this road i think he had a
[2:16:46] spiritual gps on this out here put him
[2:16:48] right back in line with the words
[2:16:54] i began to go into him
[2:16:56] and i began to think on this day
[2:16:58] we don't stay with the word i said you
[2:17:00] know him that's why we don't stay with
[2:17:02] the word
[2:17:03] i what do we do to get away from the
[2:17:04] word
[2:17:05] i'm beginning to look at this thing
[2:17:07] because i'm beginning to want to hear
[2:17:08] them as i begin to study this visit why
[2:17:11] the people they stand with the message
[2:17:12] well i'm abiding in the message how do
[2:17:14] you see them next two weeks after they
[2:17:15] come they've got prayer for the healing
[2:17:17] they got prayed for the olympics and
[2:17:19] next two weeks later why was he wasn't
[2:17:22] yeah oh yeah
[2:17:24] i got prayer for the other night to get
[2:17:25] the holy
[2:17:26] ghost i don't think i got it when you
[2:17:29] don't
[2:17:30] because if you had it you wouldn't be
[2:17:32] talking like that
[2:17:34] if you had it the devil can't make you
[2:17:35] doubt who you are
[2:17:37] the devil can make you change your
[2:17:38] confession you ain't got the holy
[2:17:50] and that way we gotta stay with that
[2:17:51] confession in other words if you're
[2:17:53] gonna abide in god you gotta keep your
[2:17:54] word you got to keep your confession the
[2:17:56] same all the time how do you got to keep
[2:17:58] saying the same thing all the time
[2:18:00] you say you know you're not saying if
[2:18:02] you're going into the rapture you got to
[2:18:04] believe it and you got to believe it all
[2:18:05] time you can't believe it hey when the
[2:18:07] first time you the devil hit you an eye
[2:18:09] on wildly while you would
[2:18:11] uh
[2:18:12] i ain't good enough for the rapture when
[2:18:14] you're not good enough
[2:18:15] you're never able to make a circumstance
[2:18:17] change your confession
[2:18:19] the devil is able to put something in
[2:18:21] your way that'll make you change your
[2:18:22] compassion i know if you got a
[2:18:24] confession in the holy ghost i don't
[2:18:26] care what come your way every time you
[2:18:28] come out you hold your head and you pray
[2:18:33] all right
[2:18:34] i don't let the devil turn you around i
[2:18:37] probably really preach a minute who is
[2:18:38] god
[2:18:39] he said
[2:18:40] he said when the inspiration in the holy
[2:18:42] spirit is here to inspire you
[2:18:45] remember god will make you come into
[2:18:47] your confession
[2:18:49] if you say
[2:18:51] i'm a drunk
[2:18:53] and i want to drink you're not wearing
[2:18:55] soon you'll be won
[2:18:58] and then you say
[2:19:00] if you say i'm a sinner and i want to
[2:19:02] sing
[2:19:03] you be you'll be right into it
[2:19:06] if you say i'm a christian
[2:19:09] oh
[2:19:10] yeah i'm gonna abide in the world
[2:19:13] because every day i don't feel like a
[2:19:15] christian every time i turn around i
[2:19:17] don't feel like a christian i don't feel
[2:19:19] like i'm a son of god but i'm not going
[2:19:21] to let the devil change my debate how do
[2:19:23] you know i'm a son of god not because i
[2:19:25] feel like i want yeah amen
[2:19:28] do you feel like you're a christian
[2:19:29] faithful no do you believe you're
[2:19:31] christian
[2:19:32] i don't
[2:19:43] and i believe it all alone god will
[2:19:46] bring your testimony he will
[2:19:48] he'll bring it to you we'll bring you
[2:19:50] right into it if you say i believe in
[2:19:53] healing
[2:19:54] i believe in healing
[2:19:56] not in feelings
[2:19:59] we got healings and feelings mixed up
[2:20:02] it's a bit different than the definition
[2:20:04] i believe in feelings no i believe in
[2:20:06] healing
[2:20:06] how did that mean if i feel like i'm
[2:20:08] here if i don't feel like a hip it don't
[2:20:10] change my
[2:20:13] confession about
[2:20:23] and believe that god has healed you
[2:20:25] confess that
[2:20:27] and god will make your body obey your
[2:20:30] confession i'm gonna stay with the world
[2:20:33] i'm gonna stay with the world holly i
[2:20:35] don't care what the devil trying to say
[2:20:37] you need to stay with the word why
[2:20:38] because we find out that the word ain't
[2:20:40] got no fault in it
[2:20:44] why it's so important to stay with the
[2:20:45] word because the word they've been
[2:20:47] proven to take the test
[2:20:53] ain't got no fault in how do you know if
[2:20:56] i stay with the word then i have the
[2:20:58] power only i have my body will come
[2:21:01] subject to release the power from my
[2:21:03] divine healing that prophecy god say you
[2:21:06] look at your new body
[2:21:11] and you don't let the devil change your
[2:21:13] convention
[2:21:14] i see me a whale body and i'm walking
[2:21:16] toward it i gotta give his high blood
[2:21:18] pressure i don't care but without
[2:21:20] baby i don't care this castle look
[2:21:22] toward their body
[2:21:33] i remember god came to zechariah
[2:21:35] and the bible
[2:21:37] when his white people receive a
[2:21:38] baby what did you do god had to shed his
[2:21:40] mouth
[2:21:41] right how did god had to shed his mouth
[2:21:44] because the main confession was i can't
[2:21:46] believe this
[2:21:47] i got to him you got to figure this out
[2:21:50] it wasn't nothing to figure out it would
[2:21:51] neither accept it or undoubtedly exactly
[2:21:54] but god can handle that priest going
[2:21:55] around preaching that god can't do
[2:21:57] nothing
[2:21:59] to his around the mouth
[2:22:01] because zechariah failed to buy with his
[2:22:03] convention
[2:22:05] he failed to stay with the word but when
[2:22:07] he came to mary
[2:22:10] hollywood he came to mary yeah honey had
[2:22:13] to marry with thoroughly after christ
[2:22:15] fully revealed himself to her
[2:22:17] mary said to him being unto me according
[2:22:20] did i work
[2:22:22] what did she have she didn't have a
[2:22:24] sensation she didn't have a feeling
[2:22:48] because i begin to realize there's no
[2:22:50] fault in him
[2:22:52] no there's no fault in him no
[2:22:54] anyway there's no death in him
[2:22:56] however there's no death there's no
[2:22:58] fault in jesus
[2:23:00] so it's very important to value him
[2:23:02] because if we guided him does that mean
[2:23:04] every demon is subject ever demon and
[2:23:06] powers
[2:23:08] he said if you notice that way he's
[2:23:09] preaching the church in the book i'm
[2:23:11] paid 15 to 16. he said if the bride ever
[2:23:13] gets a true revelation
[2:23:15] that she can do the greater work
[2:23:17] hardly if she ever gets the true
[2:23:19] revelation
[2:23:20] greatest he that's in me and he lives in
[2:23:22] the world he said the devil will be
[2:23:25] powerless
[2:23:28] true revelation
[2:23:30] not me no
[2:23:32] i got plenty of fault
[2:23:34] but we need a sacrifice without fault
[2:23:36] we need somebody that was worthy without
[2:23:38] vote
[2:23:39] how long should we realize here should
[2:23:41] we realize if she ever gets a true
[2:23:42] revelation or who here let's just see
[2:23:44] what kind of anointing that was on him i
[2:23:46] think you don't have to turn all these
[2:23:48] i'm just jumping through these real
[2:23:49] quick
[2:23:50] this ain't a sunday morning so i'm not
[2:23:51] gonna try to preach it like a sunday
[2:23:53] morning so i'm gonna i'm gonna jump
[2:23:55] through here and i'm gonna
[2:23:56] come over here we need to know what kind
[2:23:58] of knowing that was on him yeah hey if
[2:24:00] i'm if the devil got me down and beat
[2:24:02] down and i'm sick and the devil won't
[2:24:04] leave i gotta know what kind of
[2:24:05] anointing there's on me
[2:24:07] i gotta know what kind of anointing
[2:24:08] that's in the word how did it get either
[2:24:11] the sickness got power over me and the
[2:24:12] sickness is greater than god or god is
[2:24:15] greater than the sickness if god is
[2:24:16] greater than any servant said and come
[2:24:18] my way
[2:24:20] oh brother i feel like even though no
[2:24:22] i'm not giving up inside of me let's say
[2:24:26] that my god
[2:24:41] amen and they'll begin to look at him
[2:24:43] begin to realize the word
[2:24:45] the word got to be more powerful than
[2:24:47] any sugars that we come up against
[2:24:49] anything actually acts 10 screaming
[2:24:51] thank god i tried to trump
[2:24:54] acts 10 and verse 38 and he began to
[2:24:56] hear i'm talking about the naughty
[2:24:58] who had an anointing that's in this word
[2:25:01] you say brother jewel the demons bother
[2:25:02] me
[2:25:03] but you gotta hold on to this
[2:25:05] yeah
[2:25:07] you gotta take this anointed word how do
[2:25:09] you know the word you
[2:25:10] see by revelation this bible made jesus
[2:25:13] come real to you heaven the prophet was
[2:25:14] trying to do he was trying to take the
[2:25:16] person of jesus christ and make it real
[2:25:18] to you
[2:25:19] so the bride would know her make the
[2:25:21] revealed word how did people we're not
[2:25:22] preaching a book we're preaching a
[2:25:24] person i mean jesus christ the person of
[2:25:26] revelation to you and i honestly will
[2:25:28] you give a quick good understanding of
[2:25:30] who jesus christ is you know you're born
[2:25:32] again
[2:25:34] if you don't know where you are
[2:25:51] that they share the same and share the
[2:25:53] same in their meaning and the greek
[2:25:55] movements mean continue what would mean
[2:25:57] to stand i need another word so that
[2:25:59] means if i'm gonna abide in god
[2:26:02] when i come up to a circumstance i don't
[2:26:04] know what to do
[2:26:17] god
[2:26:26] how the anointing of jesus in that realm
[2:26:28] with the holy ghost
[2:26:30] and with power
[2:26:32] went and about doing good
[2:26:34] and healing
[2:26:35] all that were oppressed
[2:26:39] for god was with him right amen so now i
[2:26:43] understand if i'm getting a revelation
[2:26:46] of this word
[2:26:47] that everybody that was oppressed
[2:26:49] everybody that was obsessed with god
[2:26:52] came forth that demons had to leave
[2:26:54] that's right
[2:26:55] so that's important for me to stay with
[2:26:57] the world that ain't going to fall in
[2:26:59] for all right
[2:27:00] we find
[2:27:07] in this man called jesus
[2:27:09] my faith is holding on to that right now
[2:27:11] hey let this word begin to unfold i find
[2:27:14] no fault in this man in jesus name how
[2:27:16] do he stood the test how did he stood
[2:27:18] the word there he didn't come with
[2:27:20] sensation he didn't come by feeling he
[2:27:22] came by the spoken word he stepped into
[2:27:25] his own word in the beginning he was a
[2:27:27] word and he came down without sin that's
[2:27:30] right
[2:27:31] that's right we take us over what can
[2:27:33] wash away my sins
[2:27:35] nothing but the blood
[2:27:37] of jesus yeah i hope you're not just
[2:27:39] saying that because you read it in a
[2:27:40] book i hope you're saying it because you
[2:27:42] know it's real
[2:27:45] i'm serving a word that has no fault in
[2:27:47] it
[2:27:48] i'm saying the word ain't got nobody to
[2:27:51] say he didn't do he did this oh he made
[2:27:53] this mistake jesus didn't have a
[2:27:55] password
[2:28:22] but when you come to the blood of jesus
[2:28:23] christ what the first thing he do he
[2:28:25] drop your knee he dropped me in him he
[2:28:27] dropped you in the blink why are you
[2:28:28] talking in the belief because he gotta
[2:28:30] do away with your past life so when god
[2:28:32] look at you he standing there justified
[2:28:34] no you never did it in the first place
[2:29:21] to himself how did the word was made
[2:29:22] flesh it was there how did he took the
[2:29:25] book himself yeah amen without sin
[2:29:28] he was the only one that could take my
[2:29:30] place
[2:29:32] now he didn't have no sin i died
[2:30:01] how good they are because they are not
[2:30:03] good enough i want them to look at it
[2:30:05] right now that i am the one that i am
[2:30:08] the one that healed them
[2:30:19] he became our sins
[2:30:21] he kept our sins upon him how do you so
[2:30:23] we can so we can so we can handle this
[2:30:25] covenant and if jesus did not go to
[2:30:28] gather
[2:30:29] for
[2:30:30] himself he went to gethsemane
[2:30:34] for me
[2:30:37] did he want to go no no no he tried to
[2:30:40] get out of this yes
[2:30:42] but he had to abide in the world
[2:30:47] that you've got to go
[2:30:49] jesus tried to get out of it he went
[2:30:51] three times in prayer all right that's
[2:30:53] right that body did not want to die
[2:30:57] what jesus was doing why didn't he want
[2:31:08] he knew
[2:31:10] that to go to gethsemane
[2:31:13] to go to calvary
[2:31:15] people have to separate from god
[2:31:17] he knew that for him to die as a sinner
[2:31:19] remember jesus couldn't die right here
[2:31:21] jesus wouldn't have been able to die
[2:31:23] because the eternal spirit that was in
[2:31:24] him was god and jesus knew that he won't
[2:31:27] have to have to totally submit himself
[2:31:29] to that have to submit himself to the
[2:31:31] plan of god i know why you think he
[2:31:33] struggled he went to gas shipping
[2:31:35] because he knew it would be a separation
[2:31:37] because god came fellowship with them
[2:32:04] he knew the death that was on him he
[2:32:06] knew he was just going to be a tooth
[2:32:08] that he got to deal with he's going to
[2:32:09] deal with pain that you're going to be
[2:32:11] so bad we're going to be so crucial that
[2:32:13] no man can burn all right that's right
[2:32:15] that's right he took the saviors of the
[2:32:17] world
[2:32:19] and he went to gethsemane for me yeah
[2:32:22] and at the end of the day he says lord
[2:32:25] and they begin to
[2:32:27] realize
[2:32:28] he got to go all the way
[2:32:30] he got to stay with the words
[2:32:32] he said lord
[2:32:34] not my will yeah
[2:32:37] it's over i'm totally surrendering right
[2:32:39] now
[2:32:40] i'm surrendering all my rights to you
[2:32:43] not my will
[2:32:45] but that will be done yes
[2:32:47] disney when they came and got to me was
[2:32:49] over there that's right
[2:33:02] he was standing there with all the pain
[2:33:05] every cigarette i smoked every needle i
[2:33:08] took ever any more act out of practice
[2:33:11] he was driving him in the country
[2:33:14] he had me on his mind
[2:33:15] because he was not a sinner he became
[2:33:17] sin
[2:33:18] he became the sins of the world how did
[2:33:20] he took the sins of the world and what
[2:33:22] he did because he took this up on him
[2:33:25] he was beats
[2:33:29] he beat somebody
[2:33:32] they took the crowns and they crowned
[2:33:34] them with the thorn of the curse a thorn
[2:33:36] being cursed that lays on the ground
[2:33:38] they put the creps up on his head and
[2:33:40] dug it in
[2:33:41] how did they tuck and beat his body in
[2:33:44] such agony and shut the pain and shut
[2:33:54] i pulled his arms out of joy pulled his
[2:33:57] legs out of joint i didn't know the way
[2:33:58] he was doing this for me
[2:34:01] he was doing it for you
[2:34:03] honey you're gonna have your faith that
[2:34:04] my brother really
[2:34:06] was jesus christ they're saying
[2:34:08] yesterday good day everybody
[2:34:11] to believe it
[2:34:13] get on me you need
[2:34:28] that they gave jesus
[2:34:29] he should have died for a longer blood
[2:34:33] that beating that he had he should have
[2:34:34] died
[2:34:36] but jesus said no man take my
[2:34:43] yeah life they have evidence right it
[2:34:45] was already spoken
[2:34:47] yeah
[2:34:48] i have power yeah the right that i'll be
[2:34:51] laying down that's right they didn't
[2:34:53] kill jesus
[2:35:09] and as he was going here
[2:35:11] i was on his mind
[2:35:15] all i need to do is recognize
[2:35:17] what he done
[2:35:19] amen for me
[2:35:21] i need a personal savior
[2:35:23] i need to know how dear he is to me you
[2:35:26] say well i went to church all my life
[2:35:27] they don't mean nothing
[2:35:29] i'll accept you recognize what he done
[2:35:30] for you
[2:35:31] cause you might not have a chance to go
[2:35:33] to church just like the thieves didn't
[2:35:34] have a chance
[2:35:36] how did the thief on the cross didn't
[2:35:37] have a
[2:35:39] the chance
[2:35:39] chance he had was to recognize that that
[2:35:42] man is dying in my place
[2:35:44] and i'm putting my faith in him because
[2:35:47] i don't see it in him
[2:35:51] we gotta get our mind on myself
[2:36:02] all he did a man didn't go to church
[2:36:05] man didn't pay tithes he didn't do
[2:36:06] nothing
[2:36:07] but at the end of the day
[2:36:10] he recognized
[2:36:11] that that man is bleeding that man is
[2:36:14] shaking and bones his bones has just
[2:36:16] been pulled out of joint he's hanging on
[2:36:18] the cross
[2:36:20] the pain that he was in that man was
[2:36:23] dying for him all right he even said it
[2:36:25] it don't work he said we deserve what we
[2:36:27] get right
[2:36:29] but this man hasn't done nothing what
[2:36:30] gave him that revelation he recognized
[2:36:32] who he was
[2:36:38] but at the end of the day something came
[2:36:40] real yeah
[2:36:54] how much confession
[2:36:55] how much action yeah commercial yeah
[2:36:58] he's dying in my place
[2:37:01] this man does nothing we deserve what we
[2:37:03] get and this man turned to jesus
[2:37:07] and the blood running across jesus
[2:37:11] how many pearl phrases
[2:37:12] maybe he said lord
[2:37:14] i drunk all my life
[2:37:30] he recognized his psychonics
[2:37:33] he recognized that he would die for him
[2:37:36] jesus turned around and prophesied god
[2:37:39] said the lord
[2:37:42] that what he was saying god said the
[2:37:44] lord
[2:37:45] dang you won't be with me in paradise
[2:37:48] i claim you right now
[2:37:50] i'm planning for you when you're right
[2:38:13] grave in hell because jesus couldn't
[2:38:14] have went to hell except sin was saying
[2:38:17] the only thing could have went there and
[2:38:18] been judged
[2:38:19] our sins went to hell
[2:38:24] with the promise
[2:38:25] no man take my life i got power to lay
[2:38:28] down i got power to raise it up
[2:38:31] so you would say hell came home
[2:38:34] jesus stepped down in hell
[2:38:37] the demons realized oh
[2:38:39] we don't made a mistake
[2:38:46] this time we have bloated hallelujah
[2:38:49] because they knew he was standing there
[2:38:52] they thought how did they have covered
[2:38:54] him but they didn't realize
[2:39:08] i want you to know that the devil is
[2:39:10] powerless
[2:39:12] oh he is a big bad
[2:39:13] i'm going with no errors
[2:39:17] and trying to block you out of your face
[2:39:21] trying to make you change your
[2:39:22] confession
[2:39:24] right and he come up through paradise
[2:39:27] those saints was in there waiting on the
[2:39:28] revelation yeah he come up through
[2:39:30] paradise he stopped in paradise
[2:39:32] joshua hold on guys sitting there
[2:39:34] waiting on he had to unlock him how did
[2:39:37] it unlock the girls so they could come
[2:39:38] up now the body connects to the the head
[2:39:41] and the body connect on the eastern one
[2:39:43] and the grave over the head come through
[2:39:45] the two and the body followed it
[2:39:47] they begin to pray to people all over
[2:39:49] the city i need a resurrection but not
[2:39:51] only did he do that he gave us a plan
[2:39:54] yeah he came on the wheel
[2:39:57] that will be done
[2:39:59] if i got a will i gotta know what it is
[2:40:03] cause i'm tired of beating myself down
[2:40:06] i'm trying to tell her that they're
[2:40:07] trying to tell me i'm not good enough
[2:40:10] i figured that out a long time ago
[2:40:15] i'm not dependent on me
[2:40:17] hey man i got to put my faith in the
[2:40:19] wheel
[2:40:20] let's read the wheel
[2:40:22] isaiah 53.
[2:40:26] hey man
[2:40:27] 53 let's read the wheelchair
[2:40:29] all right
[2:40:31] let's read the wheel on parachute
[2:40:52] i don't see nothing about beating
[2:40:54] yourself up in the wheel
[2:40:55] i don't see nothing about giving up in
[2:40:57] the wheel i don't see nothing about for
[2:40:59] congress and saying you're not good
[2:41:01] enough in the will right i mean what i'm
[2:41:03] gonna look at when i read the will you
[2:41:05] got to say he was talking about me
[2:41:11] it says who else
[2:41:13] i'll report
[2:41:14] hello and to whom the arm of the lord is
[2:41:16] revealed
[2:41:18] he that grow up as before him as a
[2:41:20] kinder plant
[2:41:22] as
[2:41:23] and as a root out of dry ground he that
[2:41:27] he
[2:41:28] had no form of commonness
[2:41:30] and when we see him
[2:41:32] there is no beauty that we should desire
[2:41:33] him
[2:41:35] he will despise and reject it
[2:41:38] a man
[2:41:39] and a man and man
[2:41:41] of sorrow and acquainted with grief
[2:41:44] anywhere that grief if you would look at
[2:41:46] that word of grief in the hebrew had
[2:41:48] grieved me sickness
[2:41:50] he was acquainted with all sickness
[2:41:54] don't you don't think that god don't
[2:41:56] know what you're going through he knows

[2:47:26] across central america here there was a
[2:47:28] minister by the name of daniel
[2:47:29] greenfield
[2:47:31] and he went to sleep one night and he
[2:47:32] dreamed and he dreamed that he died and
[2:47:34] he was taken up to the gates of paradise
[2:47:38] and when he knocked at the door the
[2:47:39] doorkeeper came and said who art thou
[2:47:41] that desires to enter these gates hey
[2:47:43] look at these big shots
[2:47:45] yeah i've been in this method for years
[2:47:46] buddy
[2:47:48] man i haven't been on the missionary
[2:47:50] field
[2:47:51] here hallelujah
[2:47:54] oh yes i mean i've been good i didn't
[2:47:57] get my food i had the po
[2:47:59] i got all this but listen if you answer
[2:48:01] this question i know that's right he
[2:48:03] said i'm danny greenfield and i'm the
[2:48:05] american evangelist
[2:48:08] hey i said lord don't let me get proud
[2:48:11] keep me humble
[2:48:21] he said just a moment sir i'll see if i
[2:48:23] can find any record of you here he came
[2:48:25] back and said
[2:48:26] there's no record here of you
[2:48:36] and there's no record
[2:48:38] that's the best shape
[2:48:40] i always say there must be something
[2:48:41] wrong surely my record is there
[2:48:43] no there's no record here
[2:48:46] so well what shall i do
[2:48:48] say there's only one thing that you can
[2:48:50] do if you wish you can appeal your case
[2:48:52] to the white throne judgment
[2:48:54] call buddy oh i want to tell you
[2:48:56] something people come on i haven't been
[2:48:58] in the corner no i'm gonna be in trouble
[2:49:00] now
[2:49:02] one thing that you don't want to do is
[2:49:04] build it to supreme gordon
[2:49:06] if you got a misdemeanor i had a friend
[2:49:09] the guy shot this man shot the man was
[2:49:12] shot
[2:49:13] he was in the room and then he got up
[2:49:15] and said i'll peel
[2:49:17] i'm going to the higher court yeah he
[2:49:19] did they gave him two euros then he got
[2:49:20] 10 flat
[2:49:23] one thing you don't want to do with
[2:49:25] pillars that's right
[2:49:27] you can appeal your case to the white
[2:49:28] throne judgment if you wish to appeal
[2:49:30] your case
[2:49:31] he said well if that's all i can do i'll
[2:49:33] do it
[2:49:35] so he said he began to move out through
[2:49:37] space that it seemed like sometime he
[2:49:39] traveled just in space and after a while
[2:49:41] he came into where it began to be light
[2:49:43] lighter lighter and the lighter it got
[2:49:46] the slower he began to move
[2:49:48] and finally right in the center of the
[2:49:50] light
[2:49:51] he stopped stopped
[2:49:53] right in the presence right it's not the
[2:49:56] pure death right
[2:49:57] hallelujah
[2:49:59] where will we be at a run today
[2:50:01] who will we be in the heart
[2:50:03] we're standing in front of a mighty
[2:50:05] guard right
[2:50:07] who he was
[2:50:08] there was no certain place it was coming
[2:50:10] from but just all around him with
[2:50:11] extreme light
[2:50:13] just many times stronger and brighter
[2:50:15] than the sun and he said he looked
[2:50:16] around and after a while he a great deep
[2:50:18] voice said
[2:50:20] who art thou that standing before my
[2:50:22] judgment
[2:50:24] and he said i'm daniel greenfield the
[2:50:26] american evangelist
[2:50:28] i came to the gates of paradise and was
[2:50:30] asked to come to your judgment scene to
[2:50:32] have my case pleaded
[2:50:34] said the voice came back and said very
[2:50:36] well daniel greenfield i will try you at
[2:50:38] my judgments
[2:50:43] that's right and he says i have a law
[2:50:47] that you must be tried by said daniel
[2:50:49] greenfield did you ever
[2:50:51] tell a lie while you were on earth
[2:50:59] i wish i could say that i had never told
[2:51:01] a lot
[2:51:30] you don't know white lie you know little
[2:51:31] things that we feel like lily's holy
[2:51:33] lives
[2:51:36] the devil triggers you
[2:51:38] there ain't no there ain't no holy
[2:51:40] love
[2:51:41] a lot
[2:51:42] another word another word everybody got
[2:51:45] some little thing that they let slip by
[2:51:48] all right you know about it you know
[2:51:49] what i'm gonna i'm gonna tell this real
[2:51:51] quick i i brought her i brought her
[2:51:53] brother home i brought a crossbow
[2:51:55] nobody didn't need no brother but me and
[2:51:57] the guy i'm gone
[2:51:59] i was about to make it home
[2:52:01] nobody would have never knew this
[2:52:04] and my wife asked me
[2:52:07] wonder why women don't know
[2:52:12] there was no reason for her to ask me
[2:52:13] for that
[2:52:15] there was no reason she gonna make me
[2:52:16] tell her something i shouldn't have told
[2:52:18] her
[2:52:19] because if i could have only sneaked it
[2:52:20] in the room she would have never knew i
[2:52:22] had it because she wouldn't know i don't
[2:52:24] know what guns and things is and bowls
[2:52:26] and things she don't care about if i
[2:52:28] could have just sneaked it in the room
[2:52:31] and i was almost there
[2:52:33] and she says what you got
[2:52:37] now when the man get busted a man can't
[2:52:38] take this
[2:52:51] and then the next question i didn't want
[2:52:53] him to ask
[2:52:54] how much did you give her
[2:52:56] see that was gonna scream me just to go
[2:52:58] on the edge
[2:53:00] so i said it real fast i said
[2:53:03] a hundred dollars
[2:53:05] i did give 100 but i didn't put the plus
[2:53:06] to it
[2:53:10] yeah you know when you don't you know
[2:53:12] what to me now i'm justifying this yeah
[2:53:15] because i'm saying a hundred dollars you
[2:53:17] got to say it real fast
[2:53:19] you're gonna confuse the woman you
[2:53:20] cannot be studied
[2:53:30] but then i said well i thought when i
[2:53:31] put it in my room i said it's over with
[2:53:33] i don't have to face that no more
[2:53:36] the next day
[2:53:38] the next day the very next day she says
[2:53:42] what'd you say you gave me that boat
[2:53:46] evidently she didn't believe me
[2:53:49] cause she had no reason to ask me a
[2:53:50] second time when i told him what i gave
[2:53:52] him
[2:53:53] so and this time when a man gets busted
[2:53:56] he always shows his authority
[2:53:58] so this time i had to be aggressive
[2:54:00] because i didn't want him to ask me that
[2:54:01] never again
[2:54:02] and i looked at her like
[2:54:19] the next day
[2:54:21] she asked me again
[2:54:25] man i wanted to confess to this room now
[2:54:28] so when the man get busted we always get
[2:54:30] attitude you know what i mean
[2:54:31] all right yeah i can't three on the dog
[2:54:34] football
[2:54:39] i knew you were lying
[2:54:46] oh yeah she had me there you don't want
[2:54:49] her to catch you in a lot she only got
[2:54:50] it over here
[2:54:53] that's right
[2:54:56] but i tried to make it right
[2:54:58] and i tried to justify it
[2:55:00] but i knew it was a lie
[2:55:02] right
[2:55:03] now the most humbling experience i'm
[2:55:05] gonna have to do it and go down and look
[2:55:07] at my wife which was right
[2:55:09] for the verse and about how it says
[2:55:12] honey i want you to forgive me
[2:55:28] i'm not home right step on the back side
[2:55:31] of the house i don't get where he was he
[2:55:33] was standing in the yard here if you're
[2:55:35] in the yard you're still paying rent on
[2:55:36] it
[2:55:38] how do you stand here and then we're
[2:55:40] showing our lives a lot when you go down
[2:55:42] in the prep
[2:55:57] little things that we don't make right
[2:55:58] the boats are little foxes
[2:56:04] said daniel greenfield have you ever
[2:56:06] told a lie
[2:56:07] while you were on earth
[2:56:09] he said i thought i'd been a truthful
[2:56:11] man but in the presence of that light he
[2:56:13] said i've seen a lot of things that i
[2:56:14] had said that wasn't right
[2:56:16] and he said yes lord i lied
[2:56:19] he said daniel greenfield did you ever
[2:56:21] steal oh
[2:56:24] come
[2:56:38] short
[2:56:52] you've been guilty of stealing time that
[2:56:54] you shouldn't give to god
[2:56:55] we all got something we need to do
[2:56:58] when you're standing before god i mean a
[2:57:00] lot of stuff come out that you should
[2:57:01] know that you thought were little
[2:57:02] crooked deals
[2:57:03] you stole something you stole somebody
[2:57:05] trust you stole this it's all same
[2:57:07] spirit that's right
[2:57:10] he said daniel greenfield did you ever
[2:57:11] steal while you're on earth
[2:57:13] and he said if anything i thought i'd
[2:57:15] been i'd been honest
[2:57:16] but he said in the presence of that
[2:57:18] great light i've seen a mini a little
[2:57:20] shaky deal that i thought
[2:57:25] you let me borrow that money i'll pay
[2:57:26] you back next week don't see you for two
[2:57:28] years
[2:57:31] that's a shaky deal
[2:57:33] you know people get your money but when
[2:57:35] you get your money they quit speaking to
[2:57:37] your church you got some problems yeah
[2:57:39] right okay
[2:57:42] and at the end here he said
[2:57:44] he said father truly daniel greenfield
[2:57:47] wasn't perfect in his life but here's
[2:57:50] one thing that daniel greenfield
[2:57:53] did
[2:57:54] while he was on earth he stood for me
[2:57:58] and now i'll stand for him
[2:58:00] that's what you want
[2:58:02] you

[3:02:31] trouble i knew and then what he wanted
[3:02:33] him to do glory to him but jesus put in
[3:02:36] his words
