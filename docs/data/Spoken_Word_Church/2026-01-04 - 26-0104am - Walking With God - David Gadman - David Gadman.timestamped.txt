[2:48] without God
[2:51] or [singing] his son
[2:53] when he reached
[2:56] down his [singing] hand [music]
[2:58] for me. Amen.
[3:02] Just give him a hand. [applause]
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Tell you a little story right quick. I
[3:10] uh go in my Bible every day and I I send
[3:13] out little scriptures to different
[3:15] people I've met throughout my life that
[3:18] want me to and I just send them to them.
[3:19] And uh as I I run into these scriptures,
[3:22] I wind up reading a lot more just to
[3:25] understand it. And I get into Micah and
[3:27] and based on what Aaron was preaching
[3:29] this morning about God's word having to
[3:31] be unfolded. It's not only unfolded from
[3:34] the beginning. If we not had his word,
[3:36] we wouldn't have any way of
[3:37] communicating with him. So, he's always
[3:39] trying to bring us to a place. And uh I
[3:42] run into this place that in Micah I
[3:45] couldn't understand that fifth chapter.
[3:46] I just couldn't. And I I was telling
[3:48] Aaron about it. And so last night, I
[3:51] really really got to bugging. and turn
[3:52] the football game off. And I just sat
[3:54] there and I went through the went
[3:55] through and and started reading it. And
[3:57] I got down to the end in seven where the
[4:00] point he was trying to show me
[4:02] throughout all the misunderstanding and
[4:04] not understanding the word was he said,
[4:06] "Look,
[4:08] you're going to have these things of
[4:10] judgment. They're coming because you're
[4:12] born in sin shaped iniquity. You're
[4:14] going to have it. But I'd rather he is
[4:16] delighted in mercy. That's what he wants
[4:19] to give us is mercy."
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. throughout all things that you got
[4:22] to understand about God, if you don't
[4:24] understand one thing, he wants to give
[4:26] you mercy. And mercy is receiving that
[4:28] new birth completely. That's what that's
[4:31] about. And uh I I fought and I struggled
[4:33] with it and I tried to figure it out.
[4:35] And I loved what I was reading. I could
[4:36] see some types and shadows in there, but
[4:39] I really didn't get the point. He's
[4:41] always trying to show you a little small
[4:43] thing, and I blew it up as usual. So I I
[4:48] pray for his understanding and his
[4:49] wisdom on his word. Now that that being
[4:52] said, we'll just go to his pray pray
[4:55] thank him right now for his word.
[4:57] Precious heavenly father, we thank you
[4:58] for this day you've given us to come and
[5:00] gather around your word. And what a
[5:02] beautiful day it is you've given us to
[5:03] come, Lord. And as I look at out all
[5:05] these smiling little glowing lights out
[5:07] here, Father, this morning that you
[5:09] brought to come gather around your word.
[5:11] You said where two or three meet, you'd
[5:12] be here also, Lord God. So we know
[5:14] you're here with us, Father. And we just
[5:16] ask today that you just bless each one.
[5:18] Open their ears and your understandings,
[5:20] Lord. And just fill them with your grace
[5:22] and your mercy and your love, Father, as
[5:24] you really rather give us that mercy
[5:26] than anything cuz we put the tribulation
[5:28] out there. And we're the ones that bring
[5:30] it, Lord. But Father, you always come in
[5:33] and give us the understanding, the
[5:34] peace, and the mercy, your word. And we
[5:37] ask now, Father, that today you'd bless
[5:39] Brother David Gabman has come a long way
[5:41] to bring his word to us, Lord, that
[5:43] you've given him. and just let him speak
[5:44] that word you placed on his heart.
[5:46] Father, come across those lips you made
[5:48] of clay. And father, we ask today also
[5:50] just be with brother Wade and not here
[5:52] and brother Luis is traveling. Lord,
[5:55] just grant them safe journey and bless
[5:57] their fellowship with each other and and
[6:00] most of all their fellowship out there
[6:01] with people, Lord, and just be with them
[6:03] and bless them and bring them home
[6:04] safely, Father. Glad to have the
[6:07] Canada's back, Lord, and the other ones
[6:08] that's been traveling. And Father, today
[6:11] we ask especially that you bless those
[6:13] that couldn't get through the door
[6:14] today. Whatever the hindrance is, you
[6:15] know what it is. And just bless them and
[6:17] be with them and strengthen them, Father
[6:18] God. Especially the little ones that's
[6:21] gone astray wandering around out in the
[6:23] desert, Lord. Cuz you said we'd be there
[6:25] with our offspring. And I got some tough
[6:26] ones, Lord. I think I got the toughest
[6:29] ones in here. And I ask, Father, you
[6:31] just bless them and be with them and
[6:32] whatever it takes to get them here,
[6:33] Father, just bring them on in. And we
[6:36] just ask now, Lord, as we go to the
[6:37] reading of your word, you just come on
[6:39] the scene, Father, and you be the one to
[6:41] bless your word to us, Father, because
[6:42] we need it. We get in the way way too
[6:45] much. Thank you for your mercy and your
[6:47] grace. We ask these things in your name,
[6:50] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Uh we're going
[6:53] to Psalms 143 this morning.
[7:03] We're going to read uh 1-2.
[7:06] Hear my prayer, O Lord. Give ear to my
[7:09] supplications. In thy faithfulness,
[7:12] answer me in thy righteousness.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Enter not into judgment with thy
[7:18] servant. For in thy sight shall no man
[7:22] be.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; For the enemy hath persecuted my soul.
[7:27] He hath smite my life down to the
[7:28] ground. He hath made me to dwell in
[7:31] darkness as those that have been long
[7:34] dead.
[7:35] &gt;&gt; Therefore, my spirit overcomes within
[7:38] me. My heart meant
[7:42] &gt;&gt; I remember the days of old. I meditate
[7:45] on all thy works. I muse on the work of
[7:48] thy hands.
[7:50] I stretch forth my hands.
[7:53] My soul thirsty.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Hear me speededly, O Lord. My spirit
[8:02] faileth. Hide not thy face from me, lest
[8:05] I be like unto them that go down into
[8:08] the pit.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; For in thee do I trust.
[8:18] wherein I should walk for I lift up my
[8:21] soul unto thee.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Deliver me, oh Lord, from mine enemies.
[8:26] I flee unto thee to hide me.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Teach me to do thy will
[8:33] my God. Thy spirit is good. Lead me into
[8:36] the land of upright.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; Quicken me, oh Lord, for thy name's
[8:42] sake. For thy righteousness sake, bring
[8:45] my soul out of trouble.
[8:48] and out of mercy cut off mine enemies
[8:51] and destroy all them that afflict my
[8:54] soul for I am thy servant. Amen. Thank
[8:58] you for the reading of the word. You may
[8:59] be seated.
[9:17] Amen. Amen. Brother Boy, would you mind

[9:41] been anointed to speak to us this

[15:41] By and by when the morning comes.
[15:47] [music]
[15:51] We are often tossed and driven on the
[15:54] restless sea of time. Sumber skies and
[15:58] howling tempest off succeeded a bright
[16:01] sunshine [singing]
[16:02] in that land of perfect day. [music]
[16:05] When the mist have rolled away, we will
[16:09] understand it better by and by.
[16:14] Yes. By and by,
[16:17] when the morning comes, when all the
[16:22] saints of [music] God are gathered home,
[16:25] we will tell the story how we overcome.
[16:31] [music]
[16:31] For we'll understand it better by and
[16:35] by.
[16:37] We are often destitute of the [music]
[16:40] things that life demands. Want of food
[16:44] and [singing] want of shelter, thirsty
[16:46] hills and barren lands. But we're
[16:49] trusting in the Lord [music and singing]
[16:52] and according to his word, we will
[16:56] understand it better by and by.
[17:01] go by and ride. When the morning comes,
[17:06] when all the saints [music] of God are
[17:10] gathered home, we will tell the story
[17:16] how we [singing] overcome. For we'll
[17:19] understand it better by and by.
[17:24] Trials dark on every hand and we cannot
[17:28] understand all the ways that God would
[17:32] lead us to that [music] blessed promised
[17:34] land. But he guides us with his eye and
[17:39] we'll follow till we die. For we'll
[17:42] understand it better by and by.
[17:47] Yes. By and by. When the morning comes,
[17:53] when all the saints of God are gathered
[17:58] home, we will tell the story how we
[18:03] overcome. For we'll understand it better
[18:07] by and by.
[18:10] Temptations, hidden snares often take us
[18:15] unawares. And our hearts are made to
[18:18] bleed. For many of this word or deed and
[18:22] we wonder [music]
[18:23] why the test when we try to do our best
[18:28] but we'll understand it better by and
[18:31] by.
[18:33] [music and singing] Yes. By and by.
[18:37] When the morning comes, when all the
[18:41] saints of God [music] are gathered home,
[18:45] we will tell the story how [music] we
[18:49] overcome. For we'll understand it better
[18:53] by and by.
[18:57] Yes, by and by. Let's all stand. [music]
[19:02] When all the saints of God are gathered
[19:07] home, we will tell the story how we
[19:12] overcome. For we'll understand it better
[19:17] by and by.
[19:20] [music]
[19:22] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. You ready
[19:26] for the word this morning? Amen. And we
[19:29] appreciate brother David being with us
[19:31] this morning.
[19:32] And as brother Wade says, he doesn't
[19:35] need an introduction. I think most
[19:37] everybody [music] knows him
[19:40] all the way from the great state of
[19:41] Alabama.
[19:43] And we don't we don't hold that against
[19:45] him. Some people say, but we appreciate
[19:49] brother David and his stand and God
[19:51] touched him. I guess it was this year,
[19:54] last year and come through a lot,
[19:58] but praise God is he's still a miracle
[20:02] work in God. He's still the healer.
[20:06] You know, God put a gift in a man's life
[20:09] to do a work. And you know, the devil
[20:13] wasn't [music] happy with it trying to
[20:15] stop him.
[20:17] But you know what? A lot of prayers of
[20:20] saints went up
[20:22] and you know we got behind our brother
[20:25] and prayed for him and [music] believe
[20:27] God touch him.
[20:30] We seen a miracle. We thank God for him
[20:33] and we thank God for his ministry and
[20:35] continue to pray that God will bless him
[20:38] and use him more
[20:41] wherever he goes that
[20:45] people will be touched and God can do
[20:48] work in people's lives [music]
[20:50] and we appreciate him. And as brother
[20:53] David comes this morning, we're going to
[20:54] sing word of God ever true. We're going
[20:57] to have brother David just take his
[20:58] liberty this morning. [music]
[21:00] Just say whatever's on his heart.
[21:03] Just pour it all out. And I'm not
[21:05] looking at a man this morning. I'm
[21:06] looking at God this morning.
[21:09] I want to hear from the I want to hear
[21:10] from the throne of God this morning. I
[21:13] want God to feed my soul this [music]
[21:15] morning. Give me what I have need of.

[24:18] oh maybe year and a half, two years. I
[24:20] just passing blood and just uh didn't
[24:23] know what it was and just uh you know
[24:25] just you know trying to believe God and
[24:27] you know you want to believe God and
[24:29] everything and finally went to the
[24:31] doctor and finally she sent and or she
[24:35] uh let me uh gave me this uh colonoscopy
[24:39] doctor to go to and then uh through that
[24:42] he couldn't get it done because uh my
[24:43] oxygen level dropped and uh my uh heart
[24:46] started acting up. So from about a year
[24:50] a little over a year and a half I trying
[24:52] to get everything my heart tended to
[24:54] while my oxygen level dropped and
[24:56] everything and just finally got it
[24:58] tended to and then but still losing
[25:01] blood and everything and so she said and
[25:03] so I went back to her and she said well
[25:05] let me do want to take some blood from
[25:07] you and everything and then she called
[25:09] me she said David she said you're losing
[25:11] blood from somewhere said I don't know
[25:13] where you losing it from said and said
[25:14] your said your blood level or uh
[25:18] uh iron level is down to about an eight
[25:20] said it need or uh says if it drops one
[25:24] more level so we're going to have to do
[25:25] a blood transfusion said but said I'm
[25:27] going to put you in some iron tablets
[25:29] and said eat as much liver as you want
[25:32] and as much greens as you want and
[25:34] everything because you got to get your
[25:35] blood back up said but said I'm going to
[25:37] send you to refer you to this
[25:39] colonoscopy doctor so finally when I
[25:42] finally went in and everything regulated
[25:45] I took that it was this is in April took
[25:48] a polip out that was about 5 in or 5
[25:52] cmters I'm sorry 5 centimeters which is
[25:54] about 2 in. So then he said just I said
[25:57] I'll call you or he gave me his personal
[25:59] number said call me said if you don't
[26:02] hear from me. So he called and then he
[26:04] called me back. He said it was Canress
[26:06] said but I think I believe I got it all
[26:08] and so he said wanted to do a PET scan
[26:10] on me. Did a CT scan or CAT scan all
[26:13] these scans and everything and so he
[26:16] said we got it all but said you need
[26:19] this uh this section of your colon said
[26:23] you need it taken out. said, "It's just
[26:24] naring." He said, "You need it taken
[26:26] out." So said, "Do you have a a
[26:30] surgeon that you uh you you know?" I
[26:34] said, "No." I said, "So he referred me
[26:35] to one and he had to cancel on me." And
[26:38] so I got another one. But you know, the
[26:40] Lord knows everything.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; And so during that time, I had another
[26:43] colonosby that was in April. I had no
[26:46] another one in May. And then in June, it
[26:49] just seemed like, man, just seemed like
[26:50] everything went haywire south. and I,
[26:54] you know, just running to the bathroom
[26:56] back and forth and everything. Ended up
[26:58] in the hospital and he and then I ended
[27:00] up having another colonoscopy while I
[27:02] was in the hospital. And then when I
[27:04] went to see him, he said, "Hey, he he"
[27:06] and said, "Hey, the his nurse
[27:08] practitioner said, I'm testing you for
[27:10] three things. IBS,
[27:12] ulcerated colitis, and Crohn's." And she
[27:15] said, "I think you got Crohn's." She
[27:17] said, "I'm just I said, I just believe
[27:18] that." And so, so I went to his office
[27:21] and after she done it, after they tested
[27:24] me with the blood and everything, he
[27:26] said, "Well, I don't think he got
[27:27] Crohn's." He said, "All the signs look
[27:29] like it, but he said, I think he had
[27:30] food poisoning or whatever." Finally, he
[27:33] said, "But hey, we don't want you to do
[27:36] that colonoscopy right now." I said,
[27:37] "You need to wait." His nurse
[27:40] practitioner said, "You just your
[27:41] colon's just angry." And said, "So,
[27:44] waited for about a month. In July, about
[27:46] the end of July, had the colonoscopy.
[27:48] They took 10 inches of mullen out, but
[27:50] praise the Lord, no bag, all that. And I
[27:53] just thank God. And then the the nurse
[27:57] practitioner that of of my surgeon, she
[27:59] said, "I'm from the old school." She
[28:01] said, "I got two siblings. One died with
[28:02] cancer, one fighting cancer." Said, "I
[28:04] just want to send you to a cancer
[28:06] doctor." So, we went to a cancer doctor
[28:08] and he said, "I got good news." Said,
[28:10] "You got you had said what you we call
[28:12] that stage one." Said, "You don't need
[28:14] no treatments or anything." said, "I
[28:15] want to see you." [applause]
[28:19] Amen. Said, "I want to see you back in
[28:21] February just to for blood test and
[28:23] everything to keep a check on you." And
[28:25] I stopped him right there. I said, "You
[28:26] know what?" I said, "I thank God for the
[28:28] knowledge that you gave that he gave you
[28:30] to help me and treat me, but my ultimate
[28:33] healing comes from our body, God."
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[28:39] And so in ju so in July when they took
[28:42] that out and everything he said
[28:44] everything looked good and said so cuz
[28:45] he wanted two sections to to to tie it
[28:48] back together. He said both sections had
[28:51] to be healthy. So you know said
[28:53] everything looks good. So I was on a
[28:55] diet. I lost all through all this I lost
[28:56] about 37 pounds but I gained some of
[28:59] that back because of this year you know
[29:01] this time of year you know and all that
[29:03] them little Debbie Christmas tree cakes
[29:05] and all that. So, [laughter]
[29:07] I'm glad that's over with. So, but
[29:10] anyway, anyway, so and so my colonoscopy
[29:13] doctor, he gave me another colonoscopy a
[29:16] couple months back in November. He said,
[29:18] "I got some good news." He said, "I
[29:20] don't have to see you for a year."
[29:22] &gt;&gt; So, I thank God. Amen. And I told him, I
[29:26] said, "Well, hey, my ultimate healing
[29:27] comes from him." I said, "I'm thankful
[29:29] for you. I'm glad that God hooked me up
[29:31] with you, but my ultimate healing comes
[29:33] from him."
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I appreciate that. Amen. I
[29:37] appreciate God's still a healer.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He heals through many different
[29:41] ways. Amen.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; And I But I appreciate him. I appreciate
[29:45] being here this morning. Amen. Let me
[29:47] just read you this real quick and then
[29:49] we'll get right into the word of God.
[29:51] You love him this morning. You
[29:53] appreciate his goodness and mercy to
[29:55] you. Amen. This is from the message
[29:57] Salom. He said, "My time belongs to him.
[30:01] I'm his. I'm in his hand because he
[30:05] holds the time. I don't know what the
[30:07] future holds, but I know he holds the
[30:10] future. So he who holds the future holds
[30:13] me. So why should I think about setting
[30:16] forth this that the other for the new
[30:20] year?
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Hey, why should I worry?
[30:24] &gt;&gt; You know, we all we're humans. We all
[30:26] worry, don't we?
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Some aspect we do worry. Hey, they went
[30:31] she he called me and said it was
[30:32] cancerous. Hey, I just got kind of
[30:34] quiet, but back in my mind, you know,
[30:37] but I know he's the healer.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he said, "Why should we set
[30:41] forth this, that, or the other,
[30:44] you know,
[30:45] for the new year? I just put myself in
[30:48] his hands. Walk like David did. My time
[30:51] is in his hands." I know that I knew
[30:54] that God held the future. David didn't
[30:57] know what the future was, but he know
[30:58] God had the future. I don't know what
[31:01] the future is. None of us do, but we
[31:03] know he holds the future.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Have the message shalom. Amen. So, I say
[31:07] shalom to you this. Amen. Happy New Year
[31:10] and trust everybody had a good new year.
[31:12] Somebody asked me, he said, "Did you
[31:13] have a happy new year?" I said, "I don't
[31:14] know. It just got started." [laughter]
[31:18] But I know he holds the future and I
[31:20] know he holds my hand. Let's stand
[31:21] together. Amen. You love him this
[31:23] morning. You appreciate him. If you have
[31:25] your Bibles, turn with us to the book of
[31:27] Genesis, the fifth chapter. Just a
[31:30] little thought, just kind of on my
[31:32] heart, just kind of not knowing what to
[31:34] preach on. And brother, when brother
[31:37] Wade called me and everything, you know,
[31:39] like I said, I told him many years a uh
[31:42] a couple uh months back, you know, and I
[31:45] said, you know, you never I would have
[31:46] never dreamed that we'd be here, 2026.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, when I we first came in the
[31:52] message, my mom Arnson closing it in. He
[31:54] goes, "David, I'll be surprised you see
[31:56] your 12th birthday." Well, Brother
[31:58] Wade's 65. He'll be 65 the end of the
[32:00] month. I'll be 65 in August. Thank
[32:03] brother. Hey, and I never thought, hey,
[32:04] but here we are
[32:06] &gt;&gt; still fighting the greatest battle I'
[32:07] ever fought.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; We don't know what tomorrow holds, but
[32:10] we know who holds tomorrow.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; And I know who holds my hand.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just this little thought this
[32:16] morning if you can for the new year.
[32:18] Amen. Verse chapter 5 of Genesis verse
[32:22] 22 of chapter 5. And Enoch walked with
[32:25] God after he begat Methuselah 300 years
[32:29] and begat sons and daughters. And all
[32:31] the days of Enoch were 360 and five
[32:34] years. And Enoch walked with God and he
[32:37] was not for God took him. May the Lord
[32:40] add his blessings to the reading of the
[32:42] word. You may be seated.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then over in the book, still
[32:46] over in the book of Genesis, chapter 6,
[32:48] one chapter over verse 8 and N
[32:51] of chapter 6 of Genesis, it says, "But
[32:55] Noah found grace in the eyes of the
[32:57] Lord." These are the generations of
[33:00] Noah. Noah is a just man and perfect in
[33:03] his generation. And Noah walked with
[33:07] God.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; If I take a little thought this morning,
[33:10] it'd be walking with God. And I hope
[33:14] that every one of us for this new year
[33:15] can walk with him.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; I want to walk with him. Don't you?
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I got this little deal. Somebody
[33:21] had read this one time and and y'all
[33:24] might have forgot it. I hope so. You
[33:25] know, you can't forget a lot of things
[33:27] anymore because people put things on
[33:28] Facebook and, you know, and and and
[33:31] Instagram and all that, you know, you
[33:33] want to show pictures. You know how it
[33:34] is when you I remember when, you know,
[33:36] your parents first become, you know,
[33:38] grandparents, you like to show your,
[33:40] "Hey, this is my grandson. This is my
[33:41] granddaughter." you see, you know, but
[33:43] now you can't hardly do that cuz, you
[33:44] know, people's got Facebook. Oh, I've
[33:46] seen that. I've seen that. So, takes the
[33:47] joy out of being a grandparent
[33:48] sometimes, you know, but anyway, here we
[33:51] are, you know, and so I appreciate that,
[33:53] you know, we got five and, you know,
[33:55] they're just, you know, I appreciate
[33:56] that. You know, they're they live in
[33:58] Oklahoma. Stephanie, many of you know
[33:59] Stephanie and Harry. And, you know, my
[34:01] oldest grandson, he plays the guitar in
[34:03] the church there and just, you know, I'm
[34:06] proud of him. Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; He got his driver's license when we was
[34:10] there back in think of October. And he
[34:13] said, "Papa, can you go with me cuz
[34:15] dad's got to work?" I said, "Okay." We
[34:17] get in the car and I started telling
[34:18] said, "Now look, when you get in the car
[34:19] and she tells you what to do and then I
[34:22] said, you know what? You don't want to
[34:23] listen to this. You don't want to hear
[34:24] this. You you're you're 16 going on 30.
[34:28] You you don't want to hear this."
[34:29] [laughter]
[34:30] You know, so but anyway, we thank God
[34:32] for him. Amen.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Now, listen what this says. This says it
[34:36] says the universal this is talking about
[34:39] and he uses this scripture Psalms 14:1
[34:42] he and and Psalms 14 verse 1 through uh
[34:46] three he uses this scripture he said the
[34:47] fool has said in his heart there is no
[34:49] God
[34:51] &gt;&gt; they are corrupt they have done
[34:53] abominable works there is none that
[34:55] doeth good the Lord looked down from
[34:57] heaven upon the children of men to see
[34:59] if there were any that did understand
[35:02] and seek God all gone aside they're all
[35:05] together become filthy. There is none
[35:07] that doeth good, know not one. I thought
[35:09] my what a pitiful statement is. There's
[35:11] none that doeth good, know not one. And
[35:14] then writer says the universal
[35:15] prevalence of lust and violence
[35:18] encouraged by longevity or long duration
[35:22] which put the thought of death far away
[35:24] from the uh antidolivians
[35:28] and and was a proximate cause of the
[35:31] destruction of the ungodly world. A
[35:34] confluence or merging of various streams
[35:36] of evil had swelled into an overflowing
[35:40] torrent of corruption. The adulteress
[35:44] uh by atheistical by the atheistical
[35:46] race of Cain. The religious decline. The
[35:49] religious declining and final apostasy
[35:52] of the Sethites who disappointed in
[35:54] their hope of the promised deliverer
[35:56] abandoned their faith are attracted by
[35:59] worldly prosperity and gay lives of the
[36:01] Canaanites gradually convulted their
[36:04] society and forming matrimonial
[36:07] alliances with them merged into full
[36:10] conformity with the world. the forms of
[36:12] worship being abandoned and all sins of
[36:14] true germanal religion extinguished,
[36:17] wickedness increased with fearful
[36:20] rapidity until in the 10th generation
[36:22] the iniquity of the old world came into
[36:25] the full. The kingdom of God was
[36:27] overthrown. Satan reigned supreme in the
[36:29] world and converted this earth into a
[36:31] province of hell. Their heart was not it
[36:34] was deceitful and deprived and and and
[36:37] the thoughts of the heart were wicked
[36:39] and all that said the the imagination of
[36:41] the thoughts of the heart so that their
[36:43] designs and devices were wicked. They
[36:45] did not do evil through mere
[36:47] carelessness as though they walked at
[36:49] all adventures not heeding what they do
[36:52] but they did evil deliberately and
[36:54] designly contriving how to do mischief.
[36:57] It was bad indeed, for it was only evil,
[36:59] continually evil, and every imagination
[37:02] was so. There was no good to be found
[37:04] among them, no not one at any time. The
[37:06] stream of sin was full and strong and
[37:08] constant, and God saw it.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine here? It was there.
[37:13] They said their their conformity with
[37:15] the world, their their adulterous uh
[37:19] hour by the atheistical race of Cain,
[37:22] all this religious decline and
[37:24] everything. You look around. Hey, the
[37:26] Bible says, "It was then, so is it now."
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; And here's what it here's what this guy
[37:31] wrote. He said, "This was the condition
[37:33] of the earth in the days of Enoch to
[37:36] Noah."
[37:38] said every sin, every evil thought,
[37:42] every
[37:45] uh kind of violence, every kind of
[37:47] corruption, the attitude more uh uh race
[37:51] of Cain dominated
[37:54] the atheistic race. Cain dominated mixed
[37:57] marriages, conformity to the world.
[38:00] Their hearts were evil. Their attitudes
[38:02] were evil. Their dispositions were evil.
[38:05] Their designs were corrupt. And their
[38:07] walk was wicked.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; And yet Enoch walked with God.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; All this was going on. Their thoughts
[38:15] were evil. Their their their their
[38:18] every kind of violence, every kind of
[38:20] corruption. Yet Enoch walked with God.
[38:23] And then it was said here that Noah was
[38:25] a just man and perfect in his
[38:26] generation. And Noah walked with God.
[38:29] And neither one of them had the Holy
[38:31] Ghost like we do.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; But they still walked with God. So I
[38:35] wonder about us this morning. Hey, if if
[38:38] THEY WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST WALKED WITH
[38:40] GOD AND THEIR days was corrupt and you
[38:42] look at it TODAY AND THERE'S NO
[38:44] DIFFERENCE.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Everywhere we turn is just full of
[38:47] corruption,
[38:49] &gt;&gt; full of evil. EVERY DESIGN, EVERY
[38:51] THOUGHT, EVERY WAY YOU TURN, EVERYWHERE
[38:54] YOU LOOK, IT'S EVIL. BUT YET, THEY STILL
[38:56] WALK WITH GOD. WHAT ABOUT ME AND YOU
[38:58] THIS HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING IN IN 2026?
[39:02] I WANT TO SAY, GOD, HELP ME TO WALK WITH
[39:04] YOU THEN.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do
[39:08] &gt;&gt; is walk with God. Now, let's just look
[39:10] at this. Let's just look at this for a
[39:12] little bit if we can this morning. Amen.
[39:14] It said here that Noah was a Noah found
[39:17] grace in the eyes of the Lord. These are
[39:19] the generations of Noah. Noah's a just
[39:21] man and perfect in his generation. Noah
[39:24] walked with God. And if we look at how
[39:26] that Noah's age, you know how that uh
[39:29] and and my wife was, we was talking
[39:30] about it this morning. Something was
[39:32] said and I forgot, you know, I said,
[39:34] "But the world is looking at all these
[39:36] things. They said Russia is uh popping
[39:39] their head up again, all these things."
[39:40] And everybody said, "Well, I've heard
[39:42] that before and I've heard this before
[39:44] and heard all that." But one of these
[39:46] days is going to be reality. Don't you
[39:48] think they always heard uh in in 120
[39:51] years that Noah was alive and preaching
[39:54] that they said, "Well, we've heard that
[39:55] before. It's going to rain."
[39:58] &gt;&gt; NO ONE HAS SAID THAT BEFORE. IT'S GOING
[40:00] TO RAIN. BUT ONE DAY, IT BECAME A
[40:02] REALITY.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; And to some of them, IT WAS TOO LATE
[40:06] &gt;&gt; because they didn't get IN THE ARK AND
[40:08] THEY DIDN'T WALK WITH GOD. WHAT ABOUT ME
[40:10] AND YOU THIS MORNING? I want TO SAY,
[40:12] GOD, HELP ME IN THIS NEW YEAR. NOT NOT
[40:16] TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF OR A NEW
[40:17] BEGINNING. LORD, MY FUTURE IS IN YOUR
[40:20] HAND. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO
[40:22] HAPPEN TOMORROW. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING
[40:24] TO HAPPEN FIVE MINUTES FROM TODAY, FROM
[40:27] RIGHT NOW. BUT GOD, HELP ME TO WALK WITH
[40:29] YOU.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do. I want to walk
[40:33] with him.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; We know IT WAS A SCIENTIFIC AGE in in
[40:37] Noah's day that they could shoot the
[40:40] stars WITH RADAR AND ALL THAT, THE
[40:42] CLOUDS, AND THERE WAS NO WATER UP THERE.
[40:43] THEY BOUGHT THAT OLD CRANK. WHAT'S HE
[40:45] TALKING ABOUT? It's going to rain.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; They made fun of him.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Probably called him ALL KINDS OF NAMES.
[40:53] YET HE WALKED WITH GOD.
[40:58] [snorts]
[40:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let them call me what they
[41:01] want to. I want to walk with him this
[41:03] morning.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; I want to walk with him. Say, "Amen. I
[41:06] want to be so close to him." Amen. in
[41:09] this new year. Hey, hey, that you you
[41:12] can't tell the difference. Hallelujah.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to walk with him so
[41:17] close to him that pe that people say,
[41:20] "Hey, you know that they they might NOT
[41:22] UNDERSTAND MY DOCTRINE. They might not
[41:24] understand my ways, but Lord, help them
[41:27] to realize that I'm walking with you and
[41:29] that I got Jesus on my side. Help them
[41:32] to realize that, Lord.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be, Lord. I want
[41:36] to walk with you." Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a scientific age. We
[41:40] we know that brother random taught that
[41:42] and all these things how they did all
[41:44] this and could do all this, but yet Noah
[41:46] walked with them. They they probably
[41:48] caught them all and they probably asked
[41:49] them [snorts] and let me say don't
[41:52] discize me, but I I was watching a a
[41:56] video one time DVD uh uh uh and it it
[41:59] was through sight and sound about and
[42:01] y'all all probably seen it about Noah
[42:04] and how that Noah they portrayed him.
[42:06] Now whether he had a brother or not, I
[42:08] don't know. But they portrayed him as
[42:10] having a brother. His brother came to
[42:12] him and said, "Noah, what are you doing
[42:13] up here? They're all talking about you."
[42:15] He said, "Well," he told to his brother,
[42:16] he said, "You know, we're flesh and
[42:18] blood blood and we've been taught all
[42:19] our lives to serve Christ and all this."
[42:22] And he said, "Yeah, but you're going to
[42:24] the extreme."
[42:26] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? All I know is God
[42:28] spoke to me and he's tired of all this
[42:30] evil. He said he's even sorry that he
[42:33] even made man and that he's going to
[42:35] destroy man from off the face OF THE
[42:36] EARTH BY A FLOOD. He said, "Noah, what's
[42:39] a flood?" Noah, I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW.
[42:40] All I know he said it's going to rain.
[42:42] It's going to flood and it's GOING TO
[42:44] DESTROY MANKIND AND WE GOT TO GET ON
[42:46] THIS ARK THAT I'M BUILDING."
[42:49] &gt;&gt; He probably said, "No, HIS OWN BROTHER
[42:51] PROBABLY THOUGHT MY NOAH, YOU'RE CRAZY."
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Even maybe the mayor of the city got
[42:56] WITH HIS BROTHER SAID, "HEY, LISTEN. WHY
[42:57] DON'T YOU TALK TO YOUR BROTHER? CAN'T
[42:59] YOU TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM? BUT NOAH
[43:01] STILL WALKED WITH GOD.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH MAYBE HIS WHOLE FAMILY
[43:05] TURNED AGAINST HIM. MAYBE HIS BROTHER,
[43:07] MAYBE HIS MOM, HIS DAD, WHATEVER IT WAS
[43:09] TURNED AGAINST HIM, YET NOAH STILL
[43:11] WALKED WITH GOD. AND I WANT TO SAY THAT
[43:13] THIS MORNING, NO MATTER WHO MAY TURN
[43:15] AGAINST YOU today or NEXT WEEK OR
[43:18] WHOEVER IT MAY BE, YOUR MOM, YOUR DAD,
[43:19] OR WHOEVER IT MAY BE, I STILL WANT TO
[43:22] WALK WITH GOD.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[43:26] &gt;&gt; I want to walk with him.
[43:29] So, as we're looking at this now, let's
[43:32] just look at Enoch's walk this morning
[43:34] for a little bit,
[43:36] if we can, if you want to. Let's turn
[43:42] to Hebrews or you don't have to turn
[43:43] there, but if you want to make a note of
[43:45] it, Hebrews 11th chapter, the this is
[43:49] the faith chapter and the hall of fame
[43:53] chapter. Hebrews 11th chapter. And let's
[43:56] look at the fifth and sixth b verses of
[43:58] Hebrews 11. And let's just look at
[44:00] Enoch's walk for a little bit this
[44:02] morning and see if we can be something
[44:04] like Enoch
[44:05] &gt;&gt; because don't you want to walk with him?
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Let's just look at it in Hebrews 11
[44:12] chapter 5th and sixth birth. It says by
[44:14] faith Enoch was translated
[44:17] that he should not see death and was not
[44:19] found because God had translated him.
[44:22] For before his translation, he had this
[44:24] testimony,
[44:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:26] &gt;&gt; That he pleased God.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "But without faith is in
[44:32] it is impossible to please him. For he
[44:34] that cometh to God must first believe
[44:36] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[44:38] them that diligently seek him."
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Now, let's just look at this, like I
[44:43] said, for a few moments this morning.
[44:46] WHAT IS MEANT BY Enoch's walk? Let's
[44:48] just look at that. Now, his walk, the
[44:51] Bible says, was pleasing.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; I hope my walk can be that way this
[44:56] morning.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Pleasing to God.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible SAYS THAT HE WAS NOT FOR GOD
[45:01] TOOK HIM. NOW, he didn't do no special
[45:04] deed.
[45:06] Didn't do no THERE WASN'T NO MAYBE
[45:07] SPECIAL GIFT THAT HE HAD. BUT IT SAID BY
[45:11] FAITH Enoch walked RIGHT
[45:13] &gt;&gt; WITH GOD. BY FAITH, ENOCH WAS TRANSLATED
[45:17] THAT HE SHOULD NOT SEE DEATH AND WAS NOT
[45:18] FOUND because God had translated him.
[45:21] BUT BEFORE HIS TRANSLATION, HE HAD THIS
[45:23] TESTIMONY THAT HE PLEASED GOD. I WONDER
[45:26] BEFORE WE GET OUT OF HERE IF WE'LL HAVE
[45:28] THAT TESTIMONY THAT MY LIFE PLEASED GOD.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[45:35] You ever walk in the cemetery and you
[45:37] see the tombstones and the headstones of
[45:40] different ones and they have different,
[45:41] you know, like he's a good man and oh,
[45:44] he was one of honor and this one or he
[45:46] did this or he was a sergeant in the
[45:48] army or whatever.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Maybe, you know, maybe his his didn't
[45:52] have much, but that, you know, or
[45:54] whatever, but that HE WALKED WITH GOD.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; OH, I HOPE THAT THAT'S WHAT MINE SAYS OR
[45:59] WHATEVER IT MAY BE. WHEN PEOPLE READ
[46:02] ABOUT MY LIFE OR LOOK AT ME, I CAN SAY
[46:04] ONE THING ABOUT BROTHER DAVID THAT HE
[46:06] WALKS WITH GOD.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; OH, I HOPE THAT'S YOUR TESTIMONY THIS
[46:10] MORNING THAT YOU'RE walking with God.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; THAT YOUR WALK PLEASES HIM.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; MY WALK MAY NOT PLEASE YOU. IT MAY NOT
[46:19] PLEASE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
[46:20] STATES, BUT I WANT IT TO PLEASE HIM THIS
[46:22] MORNING.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; That's what I want my walk to do is to
[46:26] please him this morning. HALLELUJAH.
[46:29] SAYS, "BUT WITHOUT FAITH, WHICH WE KNOW
[46:32] FAITH IS A REVELATION, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
[46:34] TO PLEASE HIM." GOD HELP US TO HAVE THAT
[46:37] REVELATION OF WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO in
[46:40] this hour that we're living in.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Says, "FOR HE THAT COMETH TO
[46:45] GOD MUST BELIEVE THAT HE IS." SO HE SAYS
[46:49] THAT HE THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST FIRST
[46:51] BELIEVE THAT HE IS GOD. I SAY THAT HE'S
[46:54] GOD THIS MORNING, BROTHER AARON.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; I SAY THAT HE'S A HEALER THIS MORNING.
[46:59] HE'S A deliverer this morning. HE'S A
[47:01] SAVIOR this morning.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; You need saving,
[47:06] &gt;&gt; he's here to do it this morning.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; You need healing, he's here to do it
[47:10] this morning. YOU NEED DELIVERANCE, HE'S
[47:12] HERE TO DO IT THIS MORNING.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He's God.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M GLAD THAT HE'S GOD. I'M
[47:21] GLAD HE NEVER CHANGES. MEAN, YOU MAY
[47:23] CHANGE, BUT HE NEVER CHANGES. RIGHT.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; I MIGHT TELL YOU SOMETHING. HAVE TO COME
[47:29] BACK. AMEN. AND SAY, "I CAN'T DO IT."
[47:32] &gt;&gt; But he's never like that.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What he says he'll do. What
[47:37] he promised he'd do. And he promised
[47:39] he'd be with us here this morning. And I
[47:41] believe he's here this morning. Cuz he
[47:43] promised where two or three are gathered
[47:44] together IN MY NAME THAT I'LL BE IN THE
[47:46] MIDST. AND I BELIEVE HE'S HERE THIS
[47:47] MORNING. And I believe he's GOD THIS
[47:49] MORNING. AMEN. YOU CAN'T TELL ME NO
[47:51] DIFFERENCE. HE'S GOD this morning. HE'S
[47:54] THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[47:57] HALLELUJAH.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Them prayer requests that you had on the
[48:00] board. DON'T YOU BELIEVE HE CAN TOUCH
[48:02] EACH AND EVERY [laughter] NEED?
[48:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Whatever the need would be.
[48:09] Hallelujah.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, one of these don't do
[48:12] it." He's still God.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still God.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And just say, "Hey, I just want to
[48:18] be in his will. Whatever his will is, I
[48:21] want to be in it." We pray, DON'T WE
[48:24] PRAY? OUR FATHER, DON'T YOU WANT HIM TO
[48:26] BE YOUR FATHER?
[48:28] &gt;&gt; WHICH ART IN HEAVEN? A PLACE WHERE WE'RE
[48:30] GOING. A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO
[48:32] MISUNDERSTANDINGS. A PLACE WHERE THERE'S
[48:34] NO DISAPPOINTMENTS. A PLACE WHERE
[48:36] THERE'S NO MORE GRAVEYARDS. A PLACE
[48:38] WHERE THERE'S NO MORE SICKNESS. A PLACE
[48:40] WHERE THERE'S NO MORE THIS, THAT, OR THE
[48:42] OTHER. AMEN. THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING THIS
[48:44] MORNING. OUR FATHER. I WANT TO BE A
[48:46] FATHER TO ME THIS MORNING. THERE'S A LOT
[48:48] OF US GROWING UP. WE DIDN'T HAVE A
[48:50] FATHER, BUT HE'S OUR FATHER THIS
[48:52] MORNING.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHICH ART IN HEAVEN,
[48:56] HALLOWED BE THY NAME.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS IS
[49:00] YOUR NAME. AND I TAKE ON THAT NAME.
[49:02] LORD, HELP ME TO LIVE A WAY THAT YOUR
[49:04] NAME WILL BE HONORED THROUGH MY LIFE.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Which art in heaven.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom
[49:16] come.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. This kingdom down here is not a
[49:19] kingdom that's fit to live in. BUT
[49:21] THERE'S COMING A KINGDOM THAT'S going to
[49:23] be fit TO LIVE IN. AND HEY, I WANT TO BE
[49:25] PART OF THAT KINGDOM. So let his kingdom
[49:27] come to me now.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says his kingdom is
[49:31] what? Within you.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Let it be within me now.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thy will be done in earth as it is
[49:39] in heaven. Lord, let your will I'm
[49:42] praying, Lord, don't change my mind or
[49:44] don't change your will to meet my NEED
[49:47] OR WHATEVER. LET MY WILL BE CHANGED TO
[49:49] MEET your word.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Give us this day our DAILY BREAD. EVERY
[49:55] DAY HE'LL GIVE US WHAT WE HAVE NEED OF
[49:57] BOTH PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Forgive us of our debts as we
[50:03] forgive our debtors.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; See, he's a provider.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:11] Hey, forgive us of our debt. He's a
[50:13] pardon. He can pardon us.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; He's a provider. He's a pardon. Forgive
[50:18] us of our debts if we forgive our
[50:19] debtors and lead us not into temptation
[50:21] but deliver us from evil. He's a
[50:23] protector
[50:24] &gt;&gt; for thine is a power and the glory and
[50:27] honor for amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; I want to believe that he is God.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; And that HE'S A REWARDER OF THEM THAT
[50:35] DILIGENTLY SEEK HIM. THAT WORD
[50:37] DILIGENTLY MEANS A ENERGETIC
[50:39] APPLICATION. IN OTHER WORDS, I'M GOING
[50:41] TO PUT EVERYTHING I GOT INTO IT.
[50:45] HEY, WE PUT EVERYTHING WE got into doing
[50:47] a lot of things, don't we?

[51:02] fan and if you you're not much of one if
[51:04] you don't get into it. Brother said if
[51:06] you're a dance fiend, if you don't get
[51:08] into it, you ain't much of a dance
[51:09] fiend.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hey, if you going to cut a
[51:12] rug, let's cut a rug.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Hey, you know they say we're going to
[51:19] have a shin dig. How many know what a
[51:21] shin dig is? Then you shin and you're
[51:23] digging. Amen. What about COMING TO THE
[51:26] HOUSE OF GOD AND HAVING A SHIN DIG?
[51:28] HALLELUJAH.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; He's still real.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT HE'S A REWARDER
[51:36] THAT I WANT TO PUT EVERYTHING I GOT INTO
[51:38] IT. WE PUT EVERYTHING INTO HEY OUR WORK

[51:42] HUNTING my two grandsons especially the

[52:08] I got to work. So he's getting a little
[52:11] taste of that.

[52:38] him. You believe he's a rewarder?
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe also not
[52:46] realizing the divine presence of
[52:49] almighty God. You know,
[52:53] sometimes we spend more time, especially
[52:55] if we work a full-time job or whatever,
[52:57] we spend more time working sometimes
[53:00] than we do at home. And if you're
[53:02] working with somebody, you got a part or
[53:03] you know, you got somebody that you work
[53:05] with, you begin to know something about
[53:07] that person
[53:08] &gt;&gt; that you work with. You know what turns
[53:10] them on, pushes their buttons, so you
[53:12] don't want to, you know, you know, you
[53:14] you know, you know what I mean? You
[53:15] know, just about everything. So, you
[53:18] know, you I don't believe you can walk
[53:19] with someone daily without knowing
[53:22] &gt;&gt; something about him.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; And what about us walking with God?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we can walk with him
[53:28] every day without knowing a little bit
[53:30] OF WHAT HE'S ABOUT,
[53:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT PLEASES HIM,
[53:34] &gt;&gt; LORD. WHAT'S YOUR DESIRES?
[53:36] &gt;&gt; HOW SHOULD I CONDUCT MY LIFE? HOW SHOULD
[53:38] I CONDUCT MY LIFE AROUND YOU, LORD? AND
[53:41] NOT ONLY AROUND YOU, LORD, BUT EVERY DAY
[53:43] WHEN I WHEN I DON'T THINK YOU'RE AROUND,
[53:45] HOW SHOULD I CONDUCT MY LIFE?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; You know, always until I really got born
[53:55] again, got saved, I thought, you know,
[53:59] ever heard that old expression, the
[54:01] cat's a waste, so the mice play. You
[54:04] know,
[54:05] &gt;&gt; I thought, well, the pastor's out of
[54:06] town, so hey, I do. But hey, Brother
[54:10] Wade's out of town, so hey, let's just
[54:12] But you know, God's still watching you.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; God still knows all about you. Brother
[54:16] Wade may be gone. Amen. Or whatever.
[54:18] Brother Banner may not be here, but God
[54:20] still knows all about you.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; He still knows what you thought. He
[54:24] knows what your very thoughts are this
[54:25] morning.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, the scripture says he
[54:28] discerner the thoughts and the intents
[54:29] of the heart.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; He knows whether you rather be here or
[54:32] not.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So since we're here, WE
[54:36] MIGHT AS WELL JUST ENJOY OURSELVES. HEY,
[54:38] PEOPLE DONE SEEN YOU GET OUT OF YOUR
[54:39] CAR, WALK IN HERE. SO, WE MIGHT AS WELL
[54:41] JUST ENJOY OURSELVES WHILE WE'RE HERE.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE OLD DIG.
[54:45] AMEN. WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST CUT LOOSE.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Walk with him. Amen. We can't walk
[54:55] with him every day without knowing a
[54:58] little bit about him, WITHOUT KNOWING
[54:59] HIS INTEREST, WHAT HE'S INTERESTED IN. I
[55:02] believe he's interested in with MY MY
[55:04] FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM. MY COMMUNION with
[55:06] him. NOT JUST A PARTAKER of the Lord's
[55:09] supper. We call THAT THE LORD, BUT OUR
[55:11] OUR real communion with him is talking
[55:13] back and forth with him.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:18] Hallelujah.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; OH MY. HIS INTEREST. ALSO, IF YOU'RE
[55:22] WALKING WITH HIM, YOU'RE GOING IN THE
[55:24] SAME DIRECTION THAT HE'S GOING.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'm glad you remember the
[55:29] prophet uh God, brother Bosworth asked
[55:32] him one time said, "Brother Brand, do
[55:33] you know what fellowship is?" He said,
[55:34] "Well, I think so." He said, "That's two
[55:36] men in the same boat,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; the same ship going the same direction."
[55:41] So, HEY, MY FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM IS I'M
[55:43] GOING THE SAME direction that he's in.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the same boat that
[55:47] he's in. GOING IN THE same direction.
[55:50] Hallelujah. Going at the same pace.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going THE SAME PACE. I'M WALKING IN
[55:56] THE LIGHT AS HE IS THE LIGHT.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; They used to tell me that when people
[56:01] that especially the older folks they the
[56:04] when they used to go to church and they
[56:05] had when they went home at night it got
[56:07] dark they had to walk by lantern light
[56:10] and they couldn't get ahead of the light
[56:11] because if they got ahead of the light
[56:12] they'd fall in the ditch and if they got
[56:14] lagging behind they'd fall in the ditch.
[56:16] They had to stay right with the light as
[56:18] it shone. And that's what me and you
[56:20] have to do. Stay in the light as he is
[56:21] the light. HE'LL SHINE IN OUR PATHWAY.
[56:24] WALK IN THE LIGHT.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE FAITHFUL AND WALK IN THAT
[56:27] LIGHT, HE'LL GIVE YOU MORE LIGHT TO walk
[56:28] in.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. HE REALIZED THE DIVINE
[56:34] presence of Almighty God.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe he couldn't feel him. Maybe he
[56:39] couldn't see him, but he realized HE WAS
[56:41] RIGHT THERE CUZ he he knew that he HAD A
[56:44] PROMISE THAT GOD SAID, "I'LL BE WITH
[56:46] YOU." HALLELUJAH. SO, I'm going at THE
[56:49] SAME PACE, TRAVELING THE SAME DIRECTION.
[56:51] I don't want no distractions.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; I don't WANT ANYTHING. THAT'S WHY THEY
[56:57] SAY NOW handsfree when you're driving.
[56:59] THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO BE DISTRACTED by
[57:01] anything.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; My wife tells me we got this new car.
[57:09] She says, "I don't have to get on to you
[57:10] too much, David, because that car when
[57:11] you going to get over to the shoulder,
[57:13] it starts beeping.
[57:15] [laughter]
[57:16] Get in THE NEXT LANE, STARTS BEEPING."
[57:19] Somebody said, "You can unhook that
[57:21] thing."
[57:24] Maybe I shouldn't unhook it. Maybe it
[57:25] should be all right helping me and
[57:27] saving my wife from getting on to me cuz
[57:30] it's helping me and it's helping her.
[57:33] Hallelujah. Amen. Ah, NO DISTRACTIONS.
[57:37] I'M WALKING IN THE SAME WAY HE'S GO. AND
[57:39] ALSO another thing, IT'S A HEARTFELT
[57:41] EXPERIENCE. AMEN. I WANT IT HEARTFELT
[57:44] THIS MORNING. AMEN. AND ONE PLACE HE
[57:47] SAID, "YOU HONOR, YOU DRAW NIGH TO ME
[57:48] WITH YOUR LIPS, BUT YOUR HEART'S FAR
[57:50] FROM ME." I DON'T WANT MY HEART TO BE
[57:52] FAR FROM HIM THIS MORNING. I WANT A
[57:54] HEARTFELT RELIGION.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; WHEN I SAY HALLELUJAH, I WANT IT TO COME
[57:59] FROM THE DEPTHS OF my soul.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The depths of my innermost being.
[58:06] Amen. I want a heartfelt experience. And
[58:08] I also want to be his friend. ABRAHAM
[58:10] WAS CALLED HIS FRIEND. I WANT TO BE A
[58:13] FRIEND OF GOD. ALL RIGHT.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[58:17] I don't realize that he's right there
[58:19] with me to hold my hand to guide me.
[58:23] That's why I put my hand in his hand
[58:25] this morning.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; My time is in his hand. My hand is in
[58:30] his hand.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything about me is in
[58:33] his hand this morning.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; That's why I want to realize that I can
[58:37] walk with him. Even though the days may
[58:39] be evil, may be corrupt, sin on every
[58:43] hand, but I'm still walking with him.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm still reading his word.
[58:49] I'm still praying and I keep pressing on
[58:53] &gt;&gt; like that sister son. I keep pressing
[58:55] &gt;&gt; the battle.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I keep pressing on. Amen.
[59:00] Oh, I see this one fall. I see. But I'm
[59:02] keep pressing on, Lord.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I realize that he's right
[59:06] there with me. Another thing about
[59:08] Enoch's walk, he had great
[59:10] communication.
[59:12] Huh? You know, they tell me there's
[59:14] there's one thing that can destroy a a
[59:16] marriage and that's no communication.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; You know, somebody somebody wife asked
[59:26] him one time said, "Honey, you never
[59:29] tell me you love me." He said, "I told
[59:30] you 30 years ago that I loved you when
[59:32] we got married." Said, "Hey, if it
[59:34] changes, I'll tell you."
[59:36] You know, so but what about us? I think
[59:40] sometimes God likes to hear him tell us
[59:42] hear him tell us tell him that we love
[59:45] him.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz hey, you like your husbands tell you
[59:48] like your husband you like for your wife
[59:50] to tell you. WHAT ABOUT GOD THEN YOU
[59:52] MULTIPLY THAT? WHAT ABOUT HIM?
[59:54] &gt;&gt; DID YOU TELL HIM this morning when YOU
[59:56] WOKE UP THAT YOU LOVED HIM?
[59:58] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU WAS GLAD THAT HE WOKE YOU UP.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T
[1:00:02] WAKE UP THIS MORNING. YEAH.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; You know, we was all recipient of
[1:00:06] miracles this morning.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; we woke up.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Clothe our right mind. There's some that
[1:00:13] didn't wake up this morning.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Wonder how they stood with God. But here
[1:00:17] we are today.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're still here. And I want that
[1:00:20] great I want a GREAT COMMUNICATE. GOD,
[1:00:22] HELP me in this year 2022 to have a
[1:00:25] better COMMUNICATION WITH YOU
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; THAT I CAN TELL HIM OF MY JOY AND
[1:00:30] PRAISE. GOD, I LOVE YOU. I THANK YOU FOR
[1:00:33] HEALING ME, LORD. I THANK YOU FOR SAVING
[1:00:35] ME. I THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE
[1:00:36] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, LORD.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; I don't HAVE TO HAVE BROTHER WADE HERE.
[1:00:42] AMEN. I GOT YOU HERE, LORD. AMEN. NOT
[1:00:45] KNOCKING BROTHER WADE. AMEN. NOT
[1:00:47] KNOCKING BROTHER HOMER, ANYBODY, BUT I
[1:00:49] GOT GOD.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, God, I thank you that
[1:00:53] you woke me up. I thank you that you
[1:00:54] clothe me, Lord. I thank you, Lord, that
[1:00:56] you set my feet on another day's
[1:00:58] journey.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm praising you for it, Lord. I'm
[1:01:01] giving you grace for it, Lord.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; I'm praising you for it, Lord. I'm
[1:01:06] thanking you.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell them for joy and praise. What
[1:01:11] about our sorrow and prayer,
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Lord? I'm just coming to you, Lord.
[1:01:16] There's some things I don't understand.
[1:01:19] Some things that's happened, Lord, and I
[1:01:21] don't know why, Lord. This this
[1:01:23] happened. This happened. This person did
[1:01:25] this, and I don't understand, Lord.
[1:01:27] Lord, I know, Lord, that you got
[1:01:29] everything under control.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And I'm asking you, Lord, to help me, oh
[1:01:34] Lord, help me to maybe understand it a
[1:01:36] little bit better, Lord. But I know one
[1:01:38] things will understand it better by and
[1:01:39] by.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; I just want a communication with you,
[1:01:42] Lord.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Telling my sins in confession.
[1:01:45] HALLELUJAH. LORD, I CONFESS IN THIS day
[1:01:48] that I MADE A MISTAKE, LORD. I DID BAD,
[1:01:51] LORD. BUT LORD, YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE WE
[1:01:53] HAVE AN ADVOCATE WITH JESUS CHRIST, THE
[1:01:56] RIGHTEOUS.
[1:01:57] HALLELUJAH. AND HE'S A RIGHTEOUS JUDGE.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; He's a fair judge.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:08] I won't confess nobody else. You know,
[1:02:10] you better watch who you confess to.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before you know it. [snorts]
[1:02:17] You know, I always used to tell me when
[1:02:20] I was growing up, three fastest ways of
[1:02:22] communication. Telegram, telephone, and
[1:02:25] tell a woman. But I put a fourth one in
[1:02:27] there. Tell a preacher.
[1:02:29] [laughter]
[1:02:31] Huh?
[1:02:32] Hallelujah. Somebody said one time they
[1:02:35] was driving down the road with somebody
[1:02:37] and somebody said, "Hey, let me tell you
[1:02:38] something about this so and so and what
[1:02:40] they did and all that." He said, "I want
[1:02:42] to tell you something. I canceled my
[1:02:44] subscription." He said, "What?" He said,
[1:02:46] "I I cancel I cancelled my subscription
[1:02:49] with a message inquire."
[1:02:52] Cuz a lot of people, that's all they
[1:02:54] want to know. WE GOT A MESSAGE INQUIRE
[1:02:56] AND THEY WANT TO KNOW THE BAD ABOUT
[1:02:57] EVERYBODY.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE GOOD?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE BAD, HOW THIS ONE
[1:03:03] FELL, THIS ONE MADE A MISTAKE, THIS ONE
[1:03:06] DID THAT,
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD, I want to pray for everybody.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord, to have a good
[1:03:12] communication with you. HELP ME TO
[1:03:14] CONFESS LORD to you, Lord. And then if a
[1:03:17] brother has confidence IN ME AND THEY
[1:03:19] TELL ME, "HELP ME TO TAKE IT TO THE LORD
[1:03:21] IN PRAYER."
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; And I don't want my walk not just be a
[1:03:26] day here, day there, but let it be every
[1:03:29] day. Not just because it's Sunday and I
[1:03:32] I got to go to church, not because IT'S
[1:03:33] WEDNESDAY, BUT EVERY DAY,
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; seven days a week, 247.
[1:03:38] Another thing about Enoch's walk, I
[1:03:41] believe his life was progressive.
[1:03:45] You believe your life is progressive.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; You know a lot of things uh more about
[1:03:50] than what you did before.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; You know, you take uh however old the
[1:03:56] oldest one may be in here, you know, a
[1:03:57] lot more now than you did back, you
[1:04:00] know, during the day as they call it
[1:04:01] back in the day. Things are improved a
[1:04:04] lot better. You know, communication has
[1:04:06] proved a lot better. Cars have improved
[1:04:09] a lot better. A lot of things that
[1:04:10] improved a lot better. And you know a
[1:04:12] little bit about more things. And
[1:04:13] sometimes you wish you said my I wish I
[1:04:15] was younger but no more know what I know
[1:04:17] now. And is that right? I've heard that
[1:04:19] expression.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But hey, his life and progressive
[1:04:23] every day he grew more and more with the
[1:04:25] Lord. THAT'S WHAT I WANT MY LIFE TO BE
[1:04:27] EVERY DAY. NOT JUST A STAND STILL
[1:04:30] BECAUSE WE STAND STILL WE BECOME STALE.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; BUT I want IT TO BE PROGRESSIVE EVERY
[1:04:36] DAY. LEARNING MORE.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; MORE EVERY DAY ON YOUR JOB. BROTHER, I
[1:04:41] DON'T KNOW HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN ON YOUR
[1:04:42] JOB, but they probably did things back
[1:04:45] then that you don't do now, but you do
[1:04:47] because they found out a better way.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Made better equipment.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; How'd you look to go back to horse and
[1:04:53] buggy?
[1:04:55] I'd have to have Friday probably to get
[1:04:57] over here for today. [laughter]
[1:04:59] But now we get over here, you know, or
[1:05:02] whatever. WE JUST IMPROVING. WHAT ABOUT
[1:05:04] HEY, I WANT MY LIFE TO IMPROVE WITH GOD
[1:05:07] EVERY DAY.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; SO I KNOW HOW TO WITNESS BETTER.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; I know. HEY, AT ONE TIME WHEN I KNOW
[1:05:15] WHEN I FIRST COME IN THIS, HEY, WE WOULD
[1:05:17] JUST GUNGHO about everything.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; You couldn't do this and you couldn't do
[1:05:21] this. you go to hell if you do this and
[1:05:23] you do this and some people young people
[1:05:25] my age are left a message and not
[1:05:28] serving God because what it just became
[1:05:30] a book of rules
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; a book of dos and don'ts and they never
[1:05:34] did fall in love with God
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; help us Lord I want to fall in love with
[1:05:39] him
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; my communication be better my life be
[1:05:44] progressing amen because hey hallelujah
[1:05:48] I I I tell you one thing you just don't
[1:05:51] Oh, hey. You say, "Well, what about
[1:05:52] this? What about this? And what about
[1:05:54] this one? What about this one? What
[1:05:55] about your son? WHAT ABOUT YOUR
[1:05:57] DAUGHTER? WHAT ABOUT IT?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO PRAY FOR THEM."
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT VOICE OF GOD?
[1:06:04] WHAT ABOUT THIS? I PRAY FOR THEM.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THEY
[1:06:08] DO, BUT I WANT TO PRAY FOR HIM. I
[1:06:10] BELIEVE THE PROPHET would want me to
[1:06:11] pray for him." Right.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; And the other on the other hand, if he
[1:06:16] was still alive, I believe he'd be
[1:06:18] praying for my family
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; and the needs of my life.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; So be vice versa. I want my life to be
[1:06:23] progressive,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; So I can enjoy more.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I can understand more.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; I have more love.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; I CAN ENJOY MORE. I CAN UNDERSTAND MORE.
[1:06:39] AND I CAN LOVE MORE.
[1:06:42] THEN I can receive more.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And then IF I ENJOY MORE, I UNDERSTAND
[1:06:48] MORE, AND I LOVE MORE, AND I RECEIVE
[1:06:50] MORE, THEN I CAN GIVE OUT MORE.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I want it to be that way. I'm walking
[1:06:56] with God.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I want my life to be
[1:07:01] progressive. Another thing ABOUT ENOCH'S
[1:07:04] LIFE, IT WAS A HOLY LIFE.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:08] Oh, I believe his life was holy because
[1:07:10] you said he did that what was pleased
[1:07:12] God,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Huh? I believe God would never walk
[1:07:16] outside the way of holiness.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the Lord has no company
[1:07:22] with the unjust and rebellious?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord
[1:07:26] help us LIVES TO BE GOD HELP WHEN THEY
[1:07:29] WALKED THERE. THEY HAD TO be dressed
[1:07:31] them priests WHEN THEY WENT BEHIND the
[1:07:33] veil. They had to be dressed, you know,
[1:07:34] the the the garment, the mantra and
[1:07:36] everything had to be DRESSED JUST RIGHT.
[1:07:38] POMEGRANT THE BELL. AND WHEN THEY WALK
[1:07:40] HOLY, HOLY UNTO THE LORD. HOLY, HOLY
[1:07:43] UNTO THE LORD. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE THAT
[1:07:45] WAY. HOLY, holy unto the Lord.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; I want my life to be that way. I want to
[1:07:54] be holy unto him. Hallelujah.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Another thing about Enoch's
[1:08:02] walk, I believe it was a happy one.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; You know, I believe he had a happy life.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; And not just happy. And I I think I've
[1:08:15] said that here before. H comes from a
[1:08:17] word or happy comes from the word hap or
[1:08:19] happen. Something has to happen in order
[1:08:21] to make you happy.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You get to raise on the job, you're
[1:08:26] happy.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; The pastor shakes your hand, you're
[1:08:28] happy. that your favorite singer sings
[1:08:31] and you're happy.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Your favorite preacher preaches and
[1:08:34] you're happy.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; But joy comes from a different source
[1:08:38] altogether.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; It comes from the creator himself.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And if you don't get the raise ON THE
[1:08:43] JOB, IF THE PASTOR DON'T SHAKE YOUR
[1:08:45] HAND, if your favorite preacher ain't
[1:08:47] here preaching, Amen. If your if this
[1:08:50] AIN'T GOING ON, THIS JUST AIN'T RIGHT.
[1:08:52] YOU STILL GOT JOY. AND THE JOY OF THE
[1:08:54] LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH. SEE, HAPPINESS
[1:08:56] WHEN THINGS GO WRONG, HAPPINESS LOOKS
[1:08:58] FOR THE NEAREST EXIT. BUT JOY STANDS
[1:09:01] THERE STEADY.
[1:09:03] [applause and cheering]
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So you had a HAPPY LIFE, A JOYFUL
[1:09:11] LIFE. YEAH,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; I mean,
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; if you in the natural
[1:09:20] and you would say that, hey, listen,
[1:09:24] you're you're working for the president
[1:09:26] United States, though you may disagree
[1:09:28] with some of his policies or whatever,
[1:09:30] you know, and how everything, you know,
[1:09:33] you know, that that the weather has been
[1:09:35] kind of unusual this year,
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; hasn't it?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; You know whose fault that is? Trump's.
[1:09:42] Everybody blames everything on Trump.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; So, it's Trump's fault.
[1:09:47] It's Trump's fault that we're in the
[1:09:48] mess we're in. It's Trump's fault that
[1:09:51] this is going on. This is going on.
[1:09:52] Everybody, you know, hey, everybody
[1:09:54] bring And today, you know, you probably
[1:09:57] say, "Man, this service is strange."
[1:09:58] Just blame it on Brother Wade cuz he
[1:10:00] invited me. Amen. But he had a happy
[1:10:04] one. And if you could walk with Trump or
[1:10:07] whatever and and beside him and and be
[1:10:09] maybe one hey you're walk BUT WHAT ABOUT
[1:10:12] WALKING with the king of kings and the
[1:10:14] lord of lords. THE BIBLE SAYS YAY THOUGH
[1:10:16] I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW
[1:10:18] OF DEATH I WILL FEAR NO EVIL FOR THOU
[1:10:20] ART WITH ME. THY ROD AND THY STAFF THEY
[1:10:22] COMFORT ME.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:25] Oh happy life. And I oh I want my walk
[1:10:29] to be like his. Another thing about
[1:10:31] Enoch's walk. It was a safe one.
[1:10:36] HALLELUJAH. IT WILL BECAUSE HEY, the
[1:10:38] Bible says, "Hey, he that dwelleth in
[1:10:40] the secret place of THE MOST HIGH SHALL
[1:10:42] ABIDE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE ALMIGHTY."
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; What a protection.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes, hey, we pack guns and
[1:10:50] everything, but he's our ultimate
[1:10:51] protection protector.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; There's something happened to me several
[1:10:56] years ago.
[1:10:59] We used
[1:11:01] in Oxford there in Alabama. We went to
[1:11:04] Chick-fil-A that morning cuz we used to
[1:11:07] where my wife worked at this daycare. We
[1:11:10] used to clean it and we had to clean it.
[1:11:12] It had to be done because it was used
[1:11:13] for Sunday school at this church because
[1:11:15] it was church affiliated. And so we was
[1:11:18] going there Saturday to clean it before
[1:11:19] Sunday. We're sitting at Chick-fil-A and
[1:11:22] eating breakfast before we went and
[1:11:24] there's two teenagers sitting in front
[1:11:26] of us. You know, nothing, you know, free
[1:11:28] country. everything. So, we get up,
[1:11:30] we're leaving, we go get our TE's
[1:11:32] refilled. They walk out the door ahead
[1:11:34] of us. We're walking behind him and they
[1:11:37] stop right there in the middle of the
[1:11:38] sidewalk and they see somebody drive up
[1:11:40] in the car and he gets out and he's
[1:11:42] walking and they go, "What in the" and
[1:11:44] they use some choice words and he had
[1:11:46] and my wife noticed one of them cuz I
[1:11:48] think one of them had some profanity
[1:11:49] written on his head or whatever and so
[1:11:51] they stopped right there. So, we kindly
[1:11:53] scooted around, went on said, "Excuse
[1:11:55] me." went toward toward the car and then
[1:11:57] my wife know that that guy that drove
[1:11:59] up. When he got out of his car, he
[1:12:01] started following us
[1:12:03] and he followed us over to our car. My
[1:12:06] wife said, "I didn't want to say nothing
[1:12:07] to David because I didn't know what he
[1:12:09] was going to do. Just followed us and
[1:12:12] and we got in the car." My wife said,
[1:12:13] "Well, we'll just get in the car. When
[1:12:14] we get in there, I'll just hit the door
[1:12:16] latches real quick." So, and our door
[1:12:19] latches, they haven't, you know,
[1:12:21] mechanical. They didn't catch. We got in
[1:12:23] there. He got in my back seat and sat
[1:12:26] down my back seat.
[1:12:28] I looked in the rearview mirror. There
[1:12:29] he was sitting on my back seat.
[1:12:32] I politely get out of my car, open the
[1:12:36] back door, and I said, "Get out.
[1:12:39] Get out." He don't say nothing to me. He
[1:12:42] just staring. He gets out and he's still
[1:12:44] staring. And then he turns and he walks
[1:12:46] across to where them other guys are and
[1:12:48] they're kind of, you know, kind of
[1:12:50] laughing. I said, "If y'all think this
[1:12:51] is funny, it's not.
[1:12:54] I didn't have my pistol with me. I was
[1:12:57] talking to somebody at church. They
[1:12:58] said, "David, you had a right. He's in
[1:13:00] your car. That's extension of your
[1:13:02] home." But I found out later that, "Hey,
[1:13:04] that's not Hey, he had to do you harm."
[1:13:07] Well, I figured him being in my car and
[1:13:08] him not invited that be, you know. But
[1:13:11] hey, he just I guess I don't know what
[1:13:14] I'd have done. He didn't do just I don't
[1:13:16] know if he's on something, just doing it
[1:13:18] for a joke or whatever. But I tell you
[1:13:19] what, I'm glad that he watches over me.
[1:13:21] Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY LIFE IS ONE OF PROTECTION
[1:13:26] BECAUSE OF HIM.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M GLAD HE WATCHES OVER ME.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:35] HALLELUJAH. ANOTHER THING ABOUT ENOCH'S
[1:13:37] WALK, IT WAS ONE OF honor to WALK WITH
[1:13:41] THE KING of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[1:13:44] It's one of honor.
[1:13:46] Hallelujah. Remember that little girl
[1:13:49] when they gave her a flag to wave cuz a
[1:13:52] king was passing by and after after the
[1:13:56] parade was over and everything they said
[1:13:58] honey they couldn't find the little girl
[1:14:00] and the teacher got kind of beset and
[1:14:02] they went they found the girl up
[1:14:04] standing up beside a light pole just
[1:14:05] weeping said honey you all right is
[1:14:07] everything all right said didn't you see
[1:14:08] the king said oh yes I seen the king
[1:14:11] said didn't you wave your flag said oh
[1:14:12] yes I waved my flag but said I I don't
[1:14:14] know if the king seen me I'm so little I
[1:14:17] don't Oh, BUT ONE THING, GOD sees you
[1:14:18] this morning. Hallelujah. I'm glad I'm
[1:14:20] walking with him this morning. For he
[1:14:22] sees ME AND HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ME. HE
[1:14:24] KNOWS IF I'M WAVING MY HAND THIS
[1:14:26] MORNING. HE KNOWS IF I'VE GIVEN HIM
[1:14:28] PRAISE THIS MORNING. HE KNOWS ALL about
[1:14:30] me. He sees everything that I'm doing.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; It's an honor to walk with him.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; One thing about Enoch, his life was not
[1:14:40] noteworthy.
[1:14:42] You know, sometimes just if not much is
[1:14:46] said, you know, you take a city and it
[1:14:49] grows and grows, you got a lot of crime
[1:14:52] loan going on in it and especially if it
[1:14:54] grows and all that. But, you know,
[1:14:56] Enoch, his life was short. Just didn't
[1:14:59] have much to say.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Just that he walked with God.
[1:15:03] What? No. Like I said, just noteworthy.
[1:15:06] He walked with God.
[1:15:08] Hallelujah.
[1:15:11] Can you imagine who needs much details?
[1:15:15] Just that he walked with God. I don't
[1:15:18] need much details, brother Ryan. Just
[1:15:21] that I walked with God.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was a public man. Maybe
[1:15:26] he worked on a public job. I don't know.
[1:15:29] But he still walked with God. Like we
[1:15:32] read, hey, though the evil thoughts are
[1:15:34] evil, their their their designs were
[1:15:36] evil, their fashions were evil, their
[1:15:38] disposition was evil.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Their designs were corrupt, their walk
[1:15:42] was wicked, but he still walked with
[1:15:44] God.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Another thing about that, HE WAS A
[1:15:50] FAMILY MAN.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said he begat
[1:15:54] Methusela, had sons and daughters, BUT
[1:15:56] HE STILL WALKED WITH GOD. I REMEMBER
[1:15:58] BROTHER HOMER TELLING me when he first
[1:16:00] came to the message and sometimes you
[1:16:01] get the tape it wasn't filtered the
[1:16:03] wheel real and it had to be you know
[1:16:05] staticky some of them was and you know
[1:16:07] and all that and said he had to wait
[1:16:09] everybody went to bed so could get quiet
[1:16:11] so he could listen
[1:16:13] but he still walked with God maybe he
[1:16:15] HAD TO GET QUIET GET ALONG BY HIMSELF
[1:16:18] JUST TO LISTEN TO GOD MAYBE BUT HE STILL
[1:16:21] WALKED WITH GOD even though he HAD A
[1:16:23] FAMILY THAT DID influence one way or the
[1:16:25] other he still walked with Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Let that not influence us, but let us
[1:16:30] walk with God.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Another thing about Enoch, Bible said he
[1:16:38] lived in an evil age. We read it what
[1:16:40] this writer wrote. It's a day of mockers
[1:16:42] and despisers where few love God and
[1:16:45] church and state WERE PROPOSING
[1:16:47] ALLIANCE. FASHION AND PLEASURE RULED THE
[1:16:49] HOUR AND UNHOLLOW COMPROMISE WAS the
[1:16:52] order of the day.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; But he still walked with God. Amen.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Look at it.
[1:16:59] A day of mockers and despisers. What
[1:17:02] about today?
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Who few love God?
[1:17:08] Oh, they say they love God.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; They say they go to church. Maybe they
[1:17:14] do. And maybe to a certain extent they
[1:17:17] do say, but maybe it's just like I said
[1:17:19] earlier, they just honor them with their
[1:17:21] lips
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; and their hearts far from it.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:25] They're just going through the motions.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; They're just sweeping everything under
[1:17:31] the rug, so to speak.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Said Marcus despiser. Well, if you love
[1:17:37] God, church and state were proposed.
[1:17:39] What about it today?
[1:17:42] I don't know if you remember
[1:17:44] somebody sent me a a video of it last
[1:17:48] year and just only just been almost a
[1:17:51] year ago.
[1:17:53] how that when Trump became president and
[1:17:56] everything and somebody told me said
[1:17:58] well if he can get church and state
[1:17:59] together he's the man for it
[1:18:02] because you look at it and said one of
[1:18:04] the archbishops from I forget where he
[1:18:06] was from if y'all might have seen that
[1:18:08] he handed him a cross trump a cross and
[1:18:10] said he reminded him of Constantine
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandon said Constantine was
[1:18:15] never perverted he said the only thing
[1:18:17] he ever done religious and paint a cross
[1:18:18] on a church or some shields and stuff
[1:18:20] that said but he got church and state
[1:18:22] ALIGNED TOGETHER. WHAT HOUR ARE WE
[1:18:24] LIVING IN CHURCH?
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; So they would propose IT AND AND FASHION
[1:18:30] AND PLEASURE RULE THE HOUR. THINK ABOUT
[1:18:32] IT. ALL PEOPLE THINK ABOUT FASHION AND
[1:18:34] PLEASURE TODAY
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; and said unhollow compromise was ordered
[1:18:38] today.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; But you know what? a steerable witness
[1:18:42] because if you look at Jude 14 and 15
[1:18:45] the scripture says in Enoch also the
[1:18:47] seventh from Adam prophesied to these
[1:18:50] saying behold the Lord cometh with 10
[1:18:52] thousands of his saints
[1:18:54] to execute judgment upon all and to
[1:18:57] convince all that are ungodly among them
[1:19:00] of all their ungodly deeds which they
[1:19:02] have ungodly committed and of all their
[1:19:04] hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
[1:19:07] spoken against him.
[1:19:09] One of these days
[1:19:12] they're going to come.
[1:19:15] Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Remember when he went to this preached
[1:19:19] to the souls in prison? He went to hell
[1:19:22] and preached to the souls that rejected
[1:19:25] the longsuffering of Noah. He said, "I'm
[1:19:28] the one."
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet said. Shows the
[1:19:30] father 1964 or 54.
[1:19:34] He said, "I can see him. When he died,
[1:19:36] his soul went down to the regions of the
[1:19:38] loss. I could see him knock at the door
[1:19:41] of the lost. Somebody said, "Who is it?"
[1:19:43] Open the doors and there the mingling
[1:19:45] souls. They're in prison waiting for the
[1:19:47] day of judgment. He said, "You are to
[1:19:49] believe Enoch. You are to believe the
[1:19:50] prophets. I'm the virgin born son of God
[1:19:53] that Enoch said he'd come with 10,000 of
[1:19:55] his saints. I'm he.
[1:19:58] I'm the one and everything was written
[1:20:01] of me in my father's word. I have
[1:20:03] confirmed it." Yonder on the cross. It's
[1:20:05] finished. Close the door. That's all of
[1:20:08] it. They had to recognize. God, help us
[1:20:11] to recognize the hour AND THE AGE THAT
[1:20:14] WE'RE LIVING IN AND WALK WITH YOU, LORD.
[1:20:17] DON'T LET MY WALK COME UP SHORT, LORD.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; BUT LET IT BE RIGHT WITH YOU, OH GOD.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Another thing about Enoch's walk, he
[1:20:26] finished his work early.
[1:20:29] You ever finish your work early at work
[1:20:32] and they say, "Hey, you go home. You
[1:20:33] finish your work early. We'll pay you
[1:20:35] for the eight hours. You just you go
[1:20:37] home, take your little break.
[1:20:39] Hallelujah. He not finish his work
[1:20:41] early.
[1:20:43] Said it's time to come on home, son.
[1:20:46] Come on up hither. Had a testimony
[1:20:50] that he traveled faster and reached his
[1:20:52] home sooner.
[1:20:55] And you know what? He's a young man back
[1:20:56] in that day.
[1:20:59] According to you know how long did he
[1:21:01] say he lived? 300 however many years.
[1:21:04] just young man according to the day that
[1:21:05] he lived in
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; showing to me that you young people can
[1:21:09] live that life
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; and walk with God if he walked with it
[1:21:14] didn't compromise and the age that he
[1:21:17] was living in
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; it was unholy full of mockers and
[1:21:20] despisers evil on every hand wickedness
[1:21:23] on every hand and he still walked with
[1:21:24] God young people you can still walk with
[1:21:27] God and you got the Holy Ghost to help
[1:21:29] you today
[1:21:31] brother
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah fashion Blood cannot inherit
[1:21:34] the kingdom. He had to be translated.
[1:21:37] Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] Come up higher.
[1:21:41] Come on home. Bible says God took him.
[1:21:46] Maybe perhaps I don't know. Maybe some
[1:21:50] saw him when he left like Elijah, like
[1:21:52] Jesus. I don't know. But said God took
[1:21:54] him.
[1:21:56] Said the scripture says he was not.
[1:22:00] The Russians have cosmonauts.
[1:22:02] AMERICA
[1:22:04] HAS ASTRONAUTS, BUT GOD HAS was not.
[1:22:08] Hallelujah. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS, THIS
[1:22:10] BRIDE'S GOING TO BE A WAS NOT.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT WHEN GOD'S GOING TO TAKE US
[1:22:14] OUT OF HERE,
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; but until then, I want my walk to be
[1:22:19] close to him.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to be pleasing in his
[1:22:23] sight. I want it to be one of honor, one
[1:22:26] that's progressive,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; so I can love more, I can enjoy more, I
[1:22:29] can give out more, receive more.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. The Bible says he was
[1:22:33] missed. He's not found. I don't know if
[1:22:36] they look for him or not. Elijah, they
[1:22:38] look for him. 50 men of the son of
[1:22:40] prophets went out and searched.
[1:22:43] You know, true child of God, one of
[1:22:46] these days they're going to look for his
[1:22:47] brother Aaron. We're going to be gone.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:51] Amen. Like my dad used to sing a song,
[1:22:53] Just Call Me Gone. You call me anything,
[1:22:55] but just call me gone.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One of these days, you can
[1:22:58] call me gone. We are going to get out of
[1:23:00] here. Hallelujah. I want to be ready.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah. I want to walk to be right.
[1:23:06] I want to be holy. I want to be
[1:23:08] progressive. I want to recognize in his
[1:23:11] presence.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:15] That Enoch's I think his departure was a
[1:23:18] testimony.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see a lot of people going by
[1:23:24] the way. You take
[1:23:27] you know
[1:23:31] Dale
[1:23:32] different ones has gone on
[1:23:35] their walk was a testimony their
[1:23:36] departure was a testimony to those that
[1:23:38] are left behind that they left uh let's
[1:23:42] say they always say a legacy
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; that hey how their life was lived
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; how their life was conducted and you
[1:23:51] look at that and you said God help my
[1:23:52] life to be conducted like that.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe Enoch's life was a
[1:23:56] legacy to those that were left behind.
[1:23:58] Say, "Hey, if he could DO IT AND GOD
[1:24:00] TOOK HIM, MAYBE IF I COULD WALK THE SAME
[1:24:03] WAY THAT HE WALKED,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; THE SAME WAY, LIVE THE SAME WAY THAT HE
[1:24:07] LIVED, THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS I'M GOING
[1:24:09] TO BE CALLED GONE."
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Maybe a lot of people
[1:24:16] doubted a change of body, a rapture, a
[1:24:20] reward for the righteous, but there
[1:24:22] still one of these days. Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] This old Hey, I'm gonna have a hey, new
[1:24:27] head of hair. Hallelujah.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, ain't you looking for no more aches,
[1:24:34] no more pains, no more have to wear no
[1:24:36] more glasses.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; NO MORE BACKACHCHES. NO MORE HEADACHES.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; NO GOING OVER AND LOOKING AT A CEMETERY,
[1:24:45] looking over a mountain of dirt, weeping
[1:24:47] and said, "Oh, honey, I miss you,
[1:24:48] sweetheart. I miss you." NO MORE OF
[1:24:50] THAT. WE'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER MORE.
[1:24:52] AMEN.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; That's why I want to walk with him
[1:24:54] today.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to walk with him.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; And let me read you some things the
[1:25:02] prophet said. That'd be all right.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; 1954, he swore by himself. And this is
[1:25:08] what he says. And you're here to fulfill
[1:25:09] it, too. Just walk unconscious of fear.
[1:25:13] Walk unconscious of fear. He says, "Walk
[1:25:16] unconscious of criticism.
[1:25:18] We're going to get criticized.
[1:25:22] Somebody told me that well and I told
[1:25:25] somebody that said they said they want
[1:25:28] to take their and and I ain't knocking
[1:25:30] nobody. I'm just I'm just you know hey
[1:25:33] we won't have to get to you walk this
[1:25:35] walk you're going to get criticized.
[1:25:37] Hey, even when you wasn't a Christian,
[1:25:39] you was in school, if you didn't do
[1:25:40] right or whatever, people made fun of
[1:25:43] you. Like, you didn't do like maybe
[1:25:46] there was a guy that you looked up to
[1:25:47] and he did could do this and you
[1:25:49] couldn't. And maybe people knocked you
[1:25:51] because you couldn't do that,
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; And maybe they didn't want to do it no
[1:25:54] more, but you just got to get up, dust
[1:25:55] your clothes off, and keep on doing,
[1:25:57] keep on pressing.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And some people say, "Well, I you know,
[1:26:00] I got I just want to take because I got
[1:26:02] too much criticism, so I'm just going to
[1:26:03] pull all my sermons of this off the
[1:26:05] internet." And that's all RIGHT. ALL
[1:26:06] RIGHT. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, THAT'S
[1:26:08] UP TO YOU. But just think, if you going
[1:26:09] to put it out there, you're going to get
[1:26:11] criticized on a lot of things.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, if it's good or if it's
[1:26:15] bad, you're still going to get
[1:26:16] criticized.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; But you got to walk UNCONSCIOUS OF FEAR.
[1:26:24] WALK UNCONSCIOUS of criticism. Walk
[1:26:27] unconscious of the world. Walk as you
[1:26:28] WALK IN CHRIST. WALK WITH HIM. NOT
[1:26:30] PAYING ANY ATTENTION to the right or
[1:26:32] left hand. Just keep moving on. If
[1:26:35] something comes up in the church, walk
[1:26:36] with God.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "If something comes up in the
[1:26:40] church, walk with God." He says,
[1:26:41] "Hallelujah. If sickness strikes you,
[1:26:44] walk with God.
[1:26:46] IF THE NEIGHBOR DON'T LIKE YOU, walk
[1:26:49] with God."
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz you ain't going to please everybody.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; You try to please everybody
[1:26:57] all the time, you're going to wind up
[1:26:58] disappointing somebody. And maybe
[1:27:00] somebody's gonna be you
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; because you're trying to please
[1:27:04] everybody and you can't even don't even
[1:27:05] try to please yourself and so you're
[1:27:07] gonna displease somebody.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Don't Is that right?
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; So said strike you walk with God. The
[1:27:14] neighbor don't like it walked with God.
[1:27:15] Just keep on walking with God. Enoch
[1:27:17] walked one day like that. You know what
[1:27:18] he done? He walked all the way home with
[1:27:20] God.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Got so far up the road he didn't want to
[1:27:23] come back anymore.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "Amen. Walk with God. Doctor
[1:27:26] says you're going to die. Walk with
[1:27:28] God." Yeah. doctor says you well walk
[1:27:30] with God just walk with God that's all
[1:27:33] for God has promised you it'll I'll
[1:27:35] never leave you nor forsake you I'll be
[1:27:37] with you to the end of the road and he
[1:27:38] took an oath by the covenant that he
[1:27:40] gave you that he conformed that he'd
[1:27:42] confirm it just walk with God then don't
[1:27:44] pattern yourself after somebody of the
[1:27:46] world you pattern yourself after him see
[1:27:49] him watch his LIFE DON'T ACT LIKE so and
[1:27:52] so does Sister Susie or brother Jackson
[1:27:55] or whatever it may be don't act like
[1:27:59] them. You just walk with him. Fill my
[1:28:01] way every day with love as I walk with
[1:28:03] the heavenly dove. Just stay right with
[1:28:05] him. Watch how it sweetens you and cuts
[1:28:07] all the world away. Oh my. You don't
[1:28:10] care what the people say. You're walking
[1:28:13] with God.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; He said he just walked with God.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; It's like a story I heard one time.
[1:28:21] These two sisters were fellowshipping
[1:28:22] together
[1:28:24] and they just talking back and forth and
[1:28:26] said, "Boy, wasn't that service good,
[1:28:29] man. Oh, brother. So and so, he just
[1:28:31] shelled the corn, didn't he?" Said,
[1:28:33] "Man, he just he just shucked it on down
[1:28:35] to the cob, didn't he?" Said, "Man, he
[1:28:37] just said, "Man, he just" and they got
[1:28:38] to talking back and forth how God's been
[1:28:40] so good. And she said, "Man, look, I got
[1:28:43] to go home. It's getting late. I got to
[1:28:45] go home." The other sister said, "Oh,
[1:28:48] don't go home. We're just having so
[1:28:49] great a time fellowshipping together.
[1:28:51] Don't go home now. I said, "I got to. I
[1:28:52] got to get home." She said, "Why don't
[1:28:55] you come walk halfway home with me,
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; So, they started walking together and
[1:29:00] they started fellowshipping some more
[1:29:02] and talking about the goodness of the
[1:29:03] Lord. And that one sister said, "Look at
[1:29:05] here. What I done went done. I done
[1:29:06] walked all the way home with you." She
[1:29:08] said, "That's all right. Come on in.
[1:29:10] IT'S SUPPER TIME." HALLELUJAH. THAT'S
[1:29:12] WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THESE DAYS.
[1:29:13] WE'RE GOING TO WALK WITH HIM AND TALK
[1:29:15] WITH HIM AND SAID, "LORD, LOOK WHAT I
[1:29:17] DONE WENT DONE. I DONE WALKED ALL THE
[1:29:19] WAY HOME WITH YOU." HE SAID, "COME ON
[1:29:21] IN, BOY. IT'S SUPPER TIME."
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:26] [applause]
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:30] AMEN. [cheering]
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Listen again. He said, "Wouldn't that be
[1:29:34] nice if you had a testimony like that,
[1:29:36] brethren? I do only that which pleases
[1:29:38] God. Wouldn't that be wonderful?" Like
[1:29:40] Enoch walked with God 500 years had a
[1:29:42] testimony. He pleased God. He didn't
[1:29:44] have to die. Just went up. So then a
[1:29:46] little afternoon noon stroll, he just
[1:29:49] started walking out and just thought,
[1:29:50] "Well, I've been on earth long enough.
[1:29:52] I'll just walk on up." And just started
[1:29:55] by faith. He thought, "Well, I've been
[1:29:56] here long enough, so I'm kind of tired
[1:29:57] of being around here. I think I'll just
[1:29:59] throw up till I hit the Milky White way
[1:30:01] and just walk on up and knock on the
[1:30:03] door." I like that. There's a song.
[1:30:06] Amen. I just keep walking, you know.
[1:30:08] Amen. Going to walk one of these days
[1:30:10] past what was it? Mars, Jupiter, you
[1:30:12] know, and all that, and catch the Milky
[1:30:14] Way way. Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to walk on up home with
[1:30:17] him. Hallelujah. Amen. He said he just
[1:30:20] got started, you know. Hallelujah.
[1:30:23] Walked hit the Milky Way. Just walked on
[1:30:25] up, knocked at the door. So that's what
[1:30:27] he did. He said by faith he did it. The
[1:30:28] Bible said so. He just got started
[1:30:30] staying here. He said, "Well, I'm just
[1:30:32] going to walk up home. God just went on
[1:30:34] up through the air walking." He did that
[1:30:35] by faith. The Bible said he did. know
[1:30:37] when I feel death come knocking around
[1:30:39] my door, I don't have to. That that kind
[1:30:41] of faith, don't you? Well, so long ago,
[1:30:43] world, I'm going to walk away from you
[1:30:45] now and just start walking on. Just walk
[1:30:47] right on up and past the moon and stars.
[1:30:49] Strike the milky white way and go into
[1:30:51] the spheres and spheres out of the
[1:30:53] spheres. Just go on to glory. He said,
[1:30:54] "That's right. Amen. Just go on to
[1:30:57] glory." Again, the Easter Seal.
[1:31:00] He said, "Let's take another man with
[1:31:02] that anointing power or that quickening
[1:31:04] power." There's a man not way long ago
[1:31:07] by the name of Enoch when the new thing
[1:31:09] come along when something came along and
[1:31:11] said, "Well, just now we have to go back
[1:31:12] to the old school or this that or the
[1:31:14] other." Enoch walked with God. Whether
[1:31:16] God said do, Enoch never missed one
[1:31:18] word.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; I wonder if I can have a testimony like
[1:31:23] that.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Whatever God says, he said he never
[1:31:26] missed one word.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; I want that kind of testimony. I want
[1:31:30] that kind of walk.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; 2026.
[1:31:34] I don't know about tomorrow,
[1:31:36] but I know who holds my hand.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; If I put my hand in his hand, I can walk
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; like Enoch walked.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I can pray like Daniel prayed.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; I can dance like David.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; When the spirit falls upon me,
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; I'll dance like David.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; I walk like he not walked. I pray like
[1:32:00] Daniel prayed.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] Amen.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Since when one time he he said
[1:32:09] he said he not walk with God whatever
[1:32:10] God said he never missed one word with
[1:32:12] God. What was he? He was a son of God.
[1:32:14] He was an eagle that had been called to
[1:32:15] that day. Aren't you glad that you're
[1:32:17] eagle
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; that been called to this day?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what brother said
[1:32:22] in one place I think it's be certain of
[1:32:24] God. Forget what year just now. He said
[1:32:26] you know why that Enoch or Elijah came
[1:32:29] to that widow woman? cuz she was of the
[1:32:31] same caliber as Elijah.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you know why you heard the
[1:32:35] message of the hour? You was of the same
[1:32:37] caliber as Malachi 4.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO, GOD HELP IT. THANK YOU,
[1:32:42] LORD. THAT'S OF THE SAME CALIBER AS
[1:32:44] MALACHI 4.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; YES,
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; he called you. He might [clears throat]
[1:32:50] not called your brother. He might not
[1:32:52] called your mama, but he called you.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God. We might not
[1:32:58] understand that, but oh, I thank God.
[1:33:00] Anyhow,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; I pray for my family. I pray for them.
[1:33:04] Amen. I just And some of them, they
[1:33:05] believe they're all they're all right,
[1:33:07] maybe or whatever. Maybe you got some
[1:33:08] that, hey, they think they're all right
[1:33:10] and they're just deceived as deceived
[1:33:11] can be. But I thank God that he'd open
[1:33:13] my eyes that I could see, that I could
[1:33:15] walk with him.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Again, he says, "Son of God, he'd been
[1:33:22] eagle. When it come time, he was so full
[1:33:24] of that quick power. remember he had
[1:33:26] walked 500 years or more before God. Not
[1:33:28] one time had he missed his word. Not one
[1:33:30] time did he misbehave himself. Woo.
[1:33:35] You know, I think he was looking through
[1:33:36] the blood cuz hey, you said, "Hey, he
[1:33:39] cried." But hey, he knew that he was
[1:33:41] going to come and die on the cross,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; huh? All that spoke of him coming
[1:33:46] everything. And when when Abel did what
[1:33:49] he did and sue that, it was speaking of
[1:33:51] that sacrifice to come, that supreme
[1:33:53] sacrifice to come. Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. I'm so glad.
[1:33:59] Hey, he we sang that song. He was
[1:34:01] looking through the blood.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm glad. Hallelujah.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Glad that he loves me. Glad that he
[1:34:09] takes care of me.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Said he never missed his
[1:34:12] word. Never did misbehave himself. Not
[1:34:14] one time did he do that. But kept this
[1:34:16] testimony. Oh, hallelujah. One of these
[1:34:18] days when you get over there, all the
[1:34:20] devil wants to point out your mistakes
[1:34:21] and everything. But the Bible says over
[1:34:23] there, you over there in Romans around
[1:34:25] the 8th chapter, therefore there's no
[1:34:28] condemnation to them that live in who
[1:34:29] are in Christ Jesus goes on to say, him
[1:34:32] he called, he justified. Those he
[1:34:34] justified, he glorified. Who could lay
[1:34:36] charge against God's elect? God forbid
[1:34:38] any man would try to lay charge.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And if you and if you ask God for
[1:34:44] forgiveness, you know what he does? He
[1:34:45] drops it in the sea of forgiveness under
[1:34:47] in that bleached water of his blood.
[1:34:50] Hallelujah. never to be remembered no
[1:34:52] more. Hallelujah. And the devil wants to
[1:34:54] break. God says, "What's sin?"
[1:34:56] Hallelujah. What sin? Hallelujah. Uhhuh.
[1:34:59] I'm looking at a spot, spotless, UH,
[1:35:02] UNADULTERATED, VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF CHRIST.
[1:35:05] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Never did it in the first place.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; What a testimony.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said it's what he do.
[1:35:14] Slipped that on that. He said, "What a
[1:35:16] thanksgiving." He slipped that wedding
[1:35:18] bag of unmmerited grace. Yeah.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; If I had $500 in my pocket and I said,
[1:35:24] "Aaron, here it's yours. Come get it."
[1:35:26] And he came and got it, it was his cuz I
[1:35:28] gave it to him.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to work for it.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother David, can I come mow
[1:35:33] your grass?" No, I gave it to you. Can I
[1:35:35] do this? Can I do something? No, I gave
[1:35:37] it to him. That's grace.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't do nothing to earn it.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; You ever been pulled over by a cop,
[1:35:47] policeman,
[1:35:48] and he says, "You know what? I already
[1:35:50] give you a ticket cuz you know what and
[1:35:51] you know what you're doing. Like
[1:35:52] somebody said because the first thing he
[1:35:54] said, "Do you know why I pulled you
[1:35:55] over?" And you go, "Hey, you know why he
[1:35:58] pulled you over?"
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "I already give you a ticket."
[1:36:03] But she says, "I'm going to let you go."
[1:36:06] That's mercy.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Something that you deserved because you
[1:36:10] done something wrong, but he granted you
[1:36:13] mercy.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; We were all born in sin. Satan in
[1:36:16] iniquity. Come to the world speaking
[1:36:18] lies. Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; But God gave us mercy.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; I want to walk with God then.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Want to walk with him. Don't you said he
[1:36:34] was just full. He said he just wanted
[1:36:36] everything. God, he just wouldn't done
[1:36:37] it. No matter what he done, no matter
[1:36:38] what anybody else thought, he went done
[1:36:40] it. Why? He was full of that quickening
[1:36:41] empire. It come time for that old man to
[1:36:43] die. God just sit down a ladder and
[1:36:45] walked up and walked up home. He
[1:36:47] quickened him and took his mortal body
[1:36:49] up in the rapture. Amen. That's
[1:36:50] quickening power. Thank you, Jesus. He
[1:36:54] said, "That's quickening power." Amen.
[1:36:56] You believe that one more
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; one more quote and I'll read it to you
[1:37:01] and we'll let you go. Listen what he
[1:37:02] says. 1956,
[1:37:05] father, the hour has come.
[1:37:08] And now Jehoshaphat his son recognizing
[1:37:12] he takes his place had a good background
[1:37:15] to look upon to see what
[1:37:20] a man will he said to see that and so he
[1:37:23] said so when a man will walk for God he
[1:37:26] said Ofat he said he's raising up taking
[1:37:29] his place you know taking his place had
[1:37:32] a good background to look upon to see
[1:37:34] that he said now when a man will walk
[1:37:36] for God and walk with God,
[1:37:39] God will walk with that man.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; They said when a man will walk with God
[1:37:45] and for God, God will walk with that
[1:37:48] man. But when that same individual turns
[1:37:50] his back from God, then God just lets
[1:37:52] him shift for himself. And we find out
[1:37:55] it is very sad thing when we have to
[1:37:57] shift for ourselves. So when a man will
[1:38:00] walk for God and with God,
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; God will walk with that man. But when
[1:38:05] that same man turns his back and walks
[1:38:08] away from God, then God let them just
[1:38:09] shift for himself.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; I mean, wants to shift for themselves
[1:38:13] this morning.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to shift for theirelves.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; I get enough trouble trying to,
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; you know,
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; without with him without shifting for
[1:38:23] myself.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Let us walk with God.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Stand together. God bless you this
[1:38:28] morning. Happy New Year to you.
[1:38:32] Won't [applause]
[1:38:36] we just bow our head?
[1:38:42] Let's bow our heads.
[1:38:44] Heavenly Father,
[1:38:47] Lord Jesus, just kind of Lord, maybe
[1:38:51] shotgun this morning. I don't know,
[1:38:52] Lord. Only you know, Father. And Lord
[1:38:56] Jesus, I just want to say that I love
[1:38:58] you and I appreciate you so much, Lord
[1:38:59] Jesus.
[1:39:01] I appreciate you for allowing me to be
[1:39:03] able to come and fellowship with
[1:39:05] brothers and sisters of my precious
[1:39:07] faith, Lord. And Lord, I appreciate you
[1:39:10] allowing me to speak what was on my
[1:39:12] heart, Lord Jesus. And
[1:39:14] Father,
[1:39:16] Lord, I'm going to be held accountable
[1:39:18] for what I spoke this morning, Lord, if
[1:39:21] I don't walk for you. Cuz Lord, that
[1:39:24] last quote Lord, he said, "When a man
[1:39:26] will walk for God and with God, then God
[1:39:28] will walk with that man." Said, "But
[1:39:31] when that same individual
[1:39:33] turns his back on God, then God will
[1:39:36] just let him shift for himself." God, I
[1:39:38] don't want to shift for myself this
[1:39:40] morning, but I want you walking with me,
[1:39:43] Lord. Let my walk be like Enoch's, Lord.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; That'll be like Noah's father and just
[1:39:48] man, but he walked with you in the hour
[1:39:49] of criticism,
[1:39:51] the hour of unholiness.
[1:39:54] Cuz even in your scripture, Lord, you
[1:39:56] said that
[1:39:57] people got so wicked, their very
[1:39:59] thoughts, their very imaginations,
[1:40:01] everything was wicked about them. But
[1:40:03] yet [music] Enoch walked with you. Noah
[1:40:06] walked with you. Lord, when we're living
[1:40:08] in this hour where you say that as it
[1:40:10] was in the days of Noah, shall shall it
[1:40:11] be. Lord, as it was in the days [music]
[1:40:14] of Sodom, so shall it be. Lord, we see
[1:40:16] it all around us. Sodom, all around us,
[1:40:18] Lord. We see all these things, Lord.
[1:40:22] Building on every hand like there's not
[1:40:24] going to be a tomorrow. Lord, just doing
[1:40:26] this and doing this, Lord, and all that,
[1:40:28] Lord. But yet, Lord, you got a people
[1:40:32] that will [music] walk with you. And
[1:40:34] Father, their walk will be one that's
[1:40:36] Lord, that's pleasing to you, Lord. I
[1:40:39] believe you got a people that their walk
[1:40:41] will be pleasing to you, Lord. [music]
[1:40:43] Not only that, but their walk is a holy
[1:40:45] one, Lord. Their walk is a happy one,
[1:40:48] Lord, cuz they're walking with you.
[1:40:50] Their walk is one that's progressive,
[1:40:52] Lord, cuz Lord, they they they're
[1:40:55] understanding more. They're enjoying
[1:40:57] more. They're loving more. They're
[1:40:59] receiving more, and therefore they can
[1:41:00] give out more, Lord.
[1:41:03] Father, there there there's one that
[1:41:05] they got a a life that's protected
[1:41:09] by the Almighty God. Thank you, Father.
[1:41:13] Thank you, Lord. No matter what comes or
[1:41:16] goes,
[1:41:18] we're under the shelter of your arm.
[1:41:22] [music] Thank you, Father. You're
[1:41:24] protecting us, Lord. We're thanking you
[1:41:27] for that, Lord. Help us to walk with
[1:41:29] you, Lord. Father, a lot of us, Lord,
[1:41:33] nearly all of us probably, I'd be safe
[1:41:35] to say that we didn't think we'd ever
[1:41:38] reach this 2026,
[1:41:40] but we're here. We are, Lord, still
[1:41:43] fighting the greatest battle ever
[1:41:44] fought. But, Father, you're going to
[1:41:46] have a people that's going to walk with
[1:41:48] you, Lord. Father, whether I walk with
[1:41:51] you or not, they're still going to have
[1:41:53] somebody that walks with you. Lord, you
[1:41:55] [music] said in your word, you're going
[1:41:56] to have a church that's without spart or
[1:41:58] wrinkle. Whether I'm a part of it or
[1:41:59] not, you're still going to have a
[1:42:01] church. You said you're going to have a
[1:42:03] bride. Whether I'm a part of that bride
[1:42:05] or not, you're still going to have a
[1:42:07] bride. Now, Lord, you're going to still
[1:42:09] have somebody that walks with you in
[1:42:10] this evil age that we're living in.
[1:42:12] Whether I walk with you or not, Lord,
[1:42:15] just let me walk with you. Then, if
[1:42:16] you're going to have somebody to walk
[1:42:17] with you, let me walk with you. If
[1:42:20] you're going to have a bride, Lord, let
[1:42:22] me be a part of it, Father. Help me,
[1:42:24] Lord, in my walk, Lord. Lord, as we see
[1:42:27] in this late hour that we're living in,
[1:42:28] Lord, and Father, we just don't know
[1:42:30] when, Lord, it may be all over with. But
[1:42:33] until then, let us keep pressing the
[1:42:35] battle, Lord. Let us keep fighting the
[1:42:37] good fight of faith, Lord. Let us keep
[1:42:41] pressing on, Lord Jesus.
[1:42:44] And Lord, surely one of these days when
[1:42:46] we're sitting around that throne, Lord,
[1:42:48] sitting around that table thousands of
[1:42:50] miles long,
[1:42:52] Lord, there's a prophet so beautifully
[1:42:55] described it. Tears streaming down our
[1:42:57] face, Lord,
[1:43:01] we can look over at one another, Lord.
[1:43:03] [music] Battle scarred veterans.
[1:43:06] I don't know, maybe me and Brother
[1:43:07] Aaron, whoever it be,
[1:43:10] we sit across from one another and we
[1:43:11] look at each other said, "Brother David,
[1:43:12] we made it." And I said, "Yes, sir,
[1:43:14] brother." And we made it.
[1:43:17] Maybe with our wives, our families. I
[1:43:19] don't know how we'd be sitting, Lord.
[1:43:22] But then you'll come out, Lord. Take
[1:43:24] your fingers and wipe the tears from her
[1:43:26] eyes and it's all over. You don't have
[1:43:30] to cry no more. Just enter into the joys
[1:43:33] of the Lord that's prepared for you
[1:43:35] before [music] the foundation of the
[1:43:36] world. Father, until then, may I keep
[1:43:40] walking with you, Lord. May I keep
[1:43:42] pressing, Lord. Lord, help every one of
[1:43:45] these that's under the sound of my
[1:43:46] voice. Keep [music] pressing. Keep
[1:43:48] walking. Father, grant it. Lord, if
[1:43:51] there's somebody that's sick here in the
[1:43:52] building they need prayer for, we'd be
[1:43:53] glad to pray for them before we leave.
[1:43:55] [music] Lord, whatever. Father, we just
[1:43:57] ask, Lord, that you minister to each and
[1:43:59] everyone. Be with your people, Lord. be
[1:44:01] with brother Wade, Lord Hunting,
[1:44:03] different things, Lord. Different ones,
[1:44:05] different meetings they announce, Lord,
[1:44:07] [music] different things, different ones
[1:44:08] that are sick, Lord, back home in our
[1:44:10] church, Lord. Our pastor, but different
[1:44:13] ones, Lord, just be with each and every
[1:44:15] one. Lord, [music] many sick among us,
[1:44:17] many afflicted, Lord, you said many of
[1:44:19] the afflictions of the righteous, but
[1:44:21] Lord, you're the one that delivers
[1:44:23] [music] us out of them all. Thank you,
[1:44:24] Lord. May we walk with you.
[1:44:29] Until then, we just ask Lord that you
[1:44:31] [music] keep us safe.
[1:44:33] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless
[1:44:36] you this morning.
[1:44:38] Hallelujah.
[1:44:41] I give you honor.
[1:44:46] Give you [music]
[1:44:48] [singing] praise.

[1:45:29] I was afraid that night
[1:45:35] and in their pain
[1:45:40] began to sing. [singing and music]
[1:45:46] Their chains were loose.
[1:45:49] Hallelujah.
[1:45:51] and they were free.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; I bless your name.

[1:46:50] you're in a pray
[1:46:55] son in your mind.
[1:47:01] Reach out and praise.
[1:47:06] defy those chains
[1:47:11] and they will fall
[1:47:16] in Jesus name.

[1:48:05] Amen. How many enjoyed that this
[1:48:06] morning? Amen. [cheering]
[1:48:09] God bless you, brother David. We've
[1:48:12] really enjoyed that this morning. Amen.
[1:48:15] God sent his word to us and all you had
[1:48:18] to do is walk in it.
[1:48:21] And you know, Enoch believed what God
[1:48:23] told him
[1:48:25] because, you know, he said, "I had the
[1:48:26] he had a testimony [music] that he
[1:48:28] pleased God.
[1:48:31] simple faith, just believing what God
[1:48:33] told him and just kept walking. Just
[1:48:35] kept walking. Just kept walking. Walked
[1:48:37] right out of this dimension.
[1:48:40] Went right on home.
[1:48:42] And you know,
[1:48:44] he didn't let anything in the world hold
[1:48:46] him back. Didn't worry about anything
[1:48:47] like that. I think about singing this
[1:48:50] song. I bless your name. You might be
[1:48:53] bound by chains of circumstances or
[1:48:55] whatever it may be, but you know what?
[1:48:57] You just keep walking. Defy those
[1:48:59] chains. means they'll fall right off.
[1:49:01] The word's [music] been sent to you to
[1:49:04] deliver you.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:49:09] Just just a simple faith. You know, we
[1:49:13] set our alarm clocks this last night
[1:49:16] believing they were going to go off, get
[1:49:17] up this morning. We got up, went to the
[1:49:20] sink or whatever, turned the water on,
[1:49:22] turned the shower on. We expected water.
[1:49:25] It came. It was there. We got in the
[1:49:28] car, put the key in, cranked it up. We
[1:49:30] expected it to run. It ran.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; We just expected it. What? Because we've
[1:49:35] been through it before. We've seen it
[1:49:37] happen before. That's right.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Childlike [music] faith. Just simple
[1:49:40] faith. Unconscious faith.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Well, God's the same way. He's brought
[1:49:44] us through time and time and time again.
[1:49:46] That's right.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; It's the same simple faith. just to
[1:49:50] believe
[1:49:52] and all you got to do is believe it and
[1:49:55] God will come on the scene
[1:49:58] and you can have the same testimony
[1:50:00] Enoch had. You please God.
[1:50:02] He wants you to take him at his word.
[1:50:04] Believe his word.
[1:50:08] If you're sick this morning, you don't
[1:50:10] have to carry it out the door with you.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; You can leave it right here.
[1:50:15] If you got if you've got questions in
[1:50:17] your mind, whatever it is you you seek
[1:50:20] the Holy Ghost, whatever it is, you can
[1:50:22] put it right down right here. You can
[1:50:24] leave here with whatever you have need
[1:50:27] of, whatever you desire.
[1:50:30] You don't have to wait till later or
[1:50:31] some other time. No, he's right here
[1:50:32] this morning to give it to you.
[1:50:38] Brother David was talking about, you
[1:50:39] know, if you just offer somebody, I
[1:50:41] think he was [music] offering $500.
[1:50:44] Well, God has a whole lot more than that
[1:50:46] for you this morning. All you got to do
[1:50:47] is free.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; The words went forth and you can just
[1:50:52] receive all that you have need of this
[1:50:53] morning. Amen. God bless you this
[1:50:56] morning. It was good to be in the house
[1:50:58] of the Lord. And
[1:51:00] we've got we've got somebody with us
[1:51:02] this morning [music] and I appreciate
[1:51:04] him coming this morning.
[1:51:06] My buddy, Brother Mark's with us this
[1:51:08] morning.
[1:51:10] Brother Mark ain't been with us for a
[1:51:12] while and you know, he's been battling a
[1:51:14] lot of health issues and stuff, but you
[1:51:16] know, we still hold Brother Mark up.
[1:51:18] Brother, it's good to see you this
[1:51:19] morning.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be a stranger.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't fight battles all by
[1:51:26] oursel. We think we're in a battle by
[1:51:27] oursel, but you know what? There's a lot
[1:51:29] of us.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; We're behind you.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; We're fighting with you. We're holding
[1:51:35] you up in prayer.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; And don't give up.
[1:51:40] No matter how dark the road gets or
[1:51:43] situation gets, you know what? There's
[1:51:45] always light
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; because you know God is light and
[1:51:49] there's no darkness in him.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you this morning. All
[1:51:54] hearts and minds clear this morning.
[1:51:57] Amen. Well, please tell Brother David
[1:52:00] how much you enjoyed the service this
[1:52:02] morning. And uh y'all pray for me
