[1:21] Revelation chapter six
[1:27] did everybody bring their book we're
[1:30] going to read out of that so today so
[1:31] let's read them
[1:34] I go to sleep this morning so
[1:37] because of y'all I got up at 5 30 and
[1:40] read some more so maybe I needed to read
[1:42] myself so maybe there's some music okay
[1:45] and when he had opened the four steel I
[1:46] heard the voice of the fourth Beast say
[1:49] come and see
[1:50] now look at Behold a Pale Horse and his
[1:52] name that said on him was death and Hell
[1:54] Followed With It
[1:55] and power was given unto them over the
[1:58] fourth part of the Earth
[2:00] to kill the sword and with Hunger with
[2:01] death
[2:03] and with the beasts of the earth now
[2:04] let's go to Matthew
[2:06] 24.
[2:10] does everybody understand why we go to
[2:12] Matthew why we go to Matthew
[2:15] this is proving that brother Branham did
[2:18] not bring something not out of scripture
[2:21] and that Jesus
[2:23] preached six seal
[2:25] while he was here on Earth okay this is
[2:29] this this is the Sixth Seal right here
[2:31] that he was preaching on this mountain
[2:33] to his group of disciples so we're
[2:36] proving here that that Jesus preached
[2:39] them John expounded on them and then
[2:41] brother Branham just came and gave us
[2:43] the between the lines okay so he gave us
[2:45] the between the lines the Revelation
[2:46] okay that Jesus was talking about
[2:48] because Jesus only spoke so many words
[2:51] watching verse 9.
[2:53] then she'll deliver you up
[2:55] to be afflicted and shall kill you and
[2:57] you shall be hated of all Nations
[3:00] for my name's sake
[3:02] that's the fourth seal that Jesus is
[3:04] speaking of there all right turn back to
[3:06] Revelations 6 because we may read that
[3:09] again but let's read in your uh
[3:12] in the book here turn to Fourth seal all
[3:16] right
[3:19] fourth seal
[3:24] and y'all have to excuse me because I
[3:27] got up this morning at five when I got
[3:29] out or 5 30.
[3:31] and
[3:32] I was so tired last night and I forgot
[3:34] to put my take my contacts out so when I
[3:36] got up like I stuck my head in a bowl of
[3:38] milk everything was milky all that
[3:41] protein that got on my contacts so I was
[3:43] fumbling through the house I thought
[3:44] what is the problem I did like that when
[3:46] I did I pushed my contact over and I
[3:48] said I went to sleep with my contacts so
[3:49] I got to wear these glasses and my arms
[3:51] are not long enough to read
[3:53] with these glasses in them so turn to
[3:56] paragraph one
[3:58] seventeen
[4:02] 117. foreign
[4:13] now he has a name
[4:16] are we there
[4:18] they're saying man okay
[4:22] got it got it okay
[4:26] now he has a name called Death now
[4:29] notice none of the other writers none of
[4:31] the other horses are no time
[4:33] that this rider ever rode they didn't
[4:36] have that man had no name but now he is
[4:38] called death it is not mentioned see he
[4:40] is revealed now
[4:42] what he is
[4:44] death
[4:46] all right now look
[4:49] go down to paragraph one twenty
[4:52] and we're going to set our beast in
[4:54] order
[4:55] all right paragraph 120.
[4:59] then we'll get up to the Chart here but
[5:01] under the revelation of the line now
[5:02] watch now I want you to read this close
[5:04] trying to be sure wrote down Place stand
[5:07] here under not under the revelation of
[5:10] the Lion's age or the first age the
[5:12] early age
[5:13] this wasn't revealed the next day
[5:16] through the age of the ox which is the
[5:17] Dark Age
[5:19] the middle age it wasn't revealed as it
[5:21] was that's what it was nor the man-like
[5:24] Beast of wisdom representing the
[5:26] reformers Lutheran Wesley and so forth
[5:29] it wasn't revealed but in the eagle AIDS
[5:31] the last days the prophetic age were
[5:33] there is to rise prophetic utterance
[5:35] seeing to whom the secrets always come
[5:38] to now there's where we just and that's
[5:41] what he told me that's where we just
[5:42] come to so proving that all of our
[5:45] beasts are right but did you see that
[5:48] what it said in that paragraph
[5:52] 117.
[5:55] what he is is death
[5:58] all right now
[6:00] hold that in your mind
[6:03] because the four seals here well let's
[6:05] get our charges make sure we've got
[6:07] everything right it was a Pale Horse
[6:08] white red and black mixed together all
[6:11] the all brother Brian said all the
[6:13] doctrines mixed together basically
[6:15] that's what it is all the dolphins mixed
[6:17] together coming up into this age now
[6:19] this is us this is our age right here
[6:21] okay the eagle eight
[6:22] his name was death so there had to have
[6:25] something to name that all right and it
[6:29] would kill with a sword and hunger death
[6:30] and with beef
[6:32] now the combat Beast he just showed
[6:34] proved to you brother Brown did that
[6:35] that was the eagle anointing or Eagle
[6:37] age which is the seventh Church age and
[6:40] the wicked one is where death and held
[6:42] on earth now obviously we know that all
[6:45] that that brother around him saw about
[6:46] hell
[6:48] he would really think it was in hell now
[6:50] if what he saw in JC Penney's was just
[6:54] these little girls with a little bit of
[6:55] eyeliner uh you know they come into work
[6:58] and places they got tattoos all over
[7:00] them and they got Rings hanging out of
[7:01] everything they got you know every
[7:02] extremity and uh so that's what hell's
[7:06] going to be it's gonna be those hideous
[7:08] beasts just like people that are walking
[7:10] living on the Earth right now but
[7:12] they're dead the Bible says while
[7:14] they're living right
[7:15] so we have come to this for seal
[7:19] and then we see that it's come through
[7:22] the Antichrist false prophet I didn't
[7:24] cover this much because these two are
[7:26] basically about the same false prophet
[7:28] anointed false prophet we're going to
[7:29] read it in the in the syllable in a
[7:31] minute
[7:32] and then incarnate Beast now we'll not
[7:34] see this Beast incarnate we'll be gone
[7:38] the Rapture will take place God's going
[7:40] to Incarnate a group of people first
[7:42] then Satan is going to come and be
[7:44] incarnate and Beast and take over the
[7:47] world he's going to be that one that
[7:49] comes in and just takes over the world
[7:50] but it's going to be a religious taking
[7:52] over it's not going to be some of these
[7:54] dictators that we think like like we saw
[7:56] in our age in our time we've seen uh
[7:59] Saddam Hussein and and Osama Bin Laden
[8:03] that ain't nothing that ain't got
[8:04] nothing to do with the devil I mean sure
[8:05] the devil's anointed them but that's got
[8:07] nothing to do with the end of the world
[8:09] really right it's going to be a
[8:11] religious person right
[8:13] because that's where the greatest death
[8:14] is
[8:15] religious deaths spiritual death is not
[8:18] bad if you're a Christian
[8:20] but natural death is not bad if you're a
[8:23] Christian
[8:24] right that's right spiritual death is
[8:27] what's going to kill you know Beware of
[8:28] the one that can take the you know kill
[8:30] the soul or the second death
[8:32] all right that's what this is so don't
[8:34] get in your mind that we've named
[8:36] while we're dying no we've been dying
[8:39] since since Adam and Eve and it's able
[8:41] and Cain eventually died that's not a
[8:44] mystery
[8:45] you get older your body shuts down and
[8:47] you get a disease you die physical death
[8:51] right so let's get all that physical
[8:52] death out of the way because it's
[8:54] spiritual death right
[8:56] the Bible says dead while they're alive
[8:58] you can be spiritually so dead you're
[9:00] black that's right and be just the most
[9:03] alive person in the world right so this
[9:05] Antichrist this this Beast sure it came
[9:07] as a spirit
[9:09] right a saying among the people
[9:13] then it became Deeds
[9:16] put a pope in crowned him he started
[9:19] speaking
[9:20] then he became anointed during the time
[9:22] that anointing is what killed those
[9:24] people in the Dark Ages that anointing
[9:27] is what killed people spiritually in
[9:28] Lutheran Wesley's age they denominated
[9:31] the great message of Luther they
[9:33] nominated the great message of Wesley
[9:35] and let's not just disclude you know
[9:37] include let's include the Baptist and
[9:39] let's include the methodists and the
[9:40] Pentecostals all those they had a time
[9:43] right sure but they stopped and they
[9:46] died brother Brian said we're gonna read
[9:48] it right here
[9:49] we can say what we want to and we like
[9:51] Daddy said we love the people but
[9:53] brother Brown said that denominational
[9:54] system is eternally dead
[9:57] when you're eternally dead there's no
[9:59] coming back
[10:01] it's like brother Ram said one time he
[10:03] said we're standing on a Razor's Edge
[10:06] he said you fall off one side or the
[10:08] other he said you never come back
[10:09] because you know that what's that wedge
[10:11] like this you fall off this side of the
[10:13] wedge there's no way to get back unless
[10:15] you get back up on the wedge because
[10:16] you're just going to keep getting
[10:17] further and further away all right just
[10:19] like a bullet and does everybody
[10:21] understand how that works I mean brother
[10:23] around says talk about bullets too
[10:27] hold on
[10:29] we'll do that today
[10:31] because this is important because that's
[10:33] what happened in the ages what happened
[10:35] with a gun
[10:37] is a gun has a back part
[10:46] like this
[10:49] here's the barrel of the gun
[10:51] now if that Barrel extends out you're
[10:53] gonna have to get three-dimensional
[10:54] women here this is the end of the barrel
[10:57] all right
[10:59] there's a little Dot
[11:01] that sticks up about that far
[11:03] at the end of that Barrel
[11:06] now
[11:08] everybody take your fingers like that
[11:10] that's the back
[11:12] now to hold that finger up like this in
[11:14] front of it that's the front Okay you
[11:16] put this right here just like that
[11:19] and your target should be right up above
[11:21] it all right now what happens
[11:25] if this this this one does not move
[11:27] right this one stays steady but this one
[11:31] has a control it has a screw running
[11:34] through it
[11:35] all right that screw when you turn that
[11:37] screw it moves that back sight this way
[11:40] or this way okay okay all right okay so
[11:44] if you're shooting a gun like brother
[11:45] random explain if you're shooting a gun
[11:47] and say that you're over here but now
[11:49] you have to move the front over
[11:51] you got it you have to move you know
[11:54] you're like this and say that say that
[11:56] you're shooting off to the left
[11:58] that means your V is over here and
[12:00] you've had to pull this Barrel over
[12:02] because you want it lined up like this
[12:05] okay so what you got to do is if you're
[12:07] like if you're like this but you're
[12:09] shooting this way what you got to do is
[12:11] you got to move
[12:13] that thing over
[12:15] and bring that back in line and then
[12:18] you'll be shooting straight if I get it
[12:20] you understand that one brother but what
[12:21] brother Brown said is he said if you
[12:23] shoot right here though
[12:25] and you got a Target and you're shooting
[12:27] right here and here's the bullseye and
[12:29] you're shooting over here like four five
[12:31] six shots
[12:33] there's no way at 50 yards you're going
[12:36] to be off this much at 100 yards
[12:39] you're going to be off way over here
[12:41] right at 200 yards you're going to be
[12:44] off way over here you're gonna never get
[12:46] back to dead center unless you move
[12:51] this backside over
[12:54] yeah these iron socks okay they're
[12:56] Scopes that you can do the same thing
[12:57] with that's why we have scope guns look
[13:00] like this and they're the same way they
[13:01] work the same way
[13:02] what happens is this what this wire and
[13:05] this wire is on the control and you turn
[13:06] them and they go down or sideways okay
[13:08] okay all right
[13:10] so if you're hitting over here you will
[13:12] never get to Bullseye unless you change
[13:15] something
[13:17] to get back to what we call this is
[13:19] called zero zero means you get you put
[13:22] that dot right there and it puts in
[13:24] bullets right there in the middle of
[13:25] that Target
[13:27] but if you never move
[13:28] if you stop take the screw out of this
[13:31] thing and say I ain't moving it no more
[13:34] your Bullet at 400 yards is going to be
[13:37] over here 500 yards over here you
[13:39] understand you're never going to get
[13:41] back in line
[13:43] unless you move this back over to line
[13:46] up with this
[13:47] that's what brother Brown was talking
[13:49] about when he's talking about bullets
[13:50] the same way with the word of God they
[13:52] got off down here in the ages
[13:55] and started firing over here to the left
[13:57] say
[13:58] right but they never did anything he
[14:01] said that's the Old and New Testament
[14:05] um
[14:06] right Old and New Testament
[14:08] you move that over get off of the word
[14:11] you're never gonna come back because
[14:13] this is what happens see the bullet
[14:15] comes out of the hole
[14:17] and if you got it pointed in that
[14:19] direction according to this
[14:22] the bullet's gonna this is Center the
[14:24] bullet's going to hit right here well as
[14:26] you keep getting further and further
[14:28] away that bullets keep is going to be in
[14:30] a V
[14:32] so you're never going to come back to
[14:33] your target here's your target right
[14:35] here look how much further you're going
[14:36] off
[14:38] okay and I just used left for an example
[14:40] I don't mean it's left or right but one
[14:42] way or the other and if you're off this
[14:44] way you're going to go this way
[14:46] you got to come back to the
[14:49] zero and it goes right there and hits
[14:51] the Bulldog that's what brother Brown
[14:53] came to do
[14:54] he came to put it back on this Bullseye
[14:56] man had got it way off over here
[14:59] Oneness got it well over here Trinity
[15:01] got it off way over here God brought it
[15:04] back with William Branham and told him
[15:06] said right here you plant this tree in
[15:08] this tree
[15:09] pull them together and what'd he do and
[15:11] he hit the bullseye that's what he's
[15:13] talking about in these seals you got to
[15:15] come back to the original you got to
[15:17] come back so you understand now more
[15:18] what yeah when he says she had the gun
[15:20] that's what he was talking about because
[15:22] it's like and it's like he said we're
[15:23] standing on a Razor's Edge
[15:25] Lauren if you got even if you've got a
[15:28] razor blade which is what real fan but
[15:31] up there if you look on a microscope if
[15:33] you look at a microscope at a razor
[15:35] blade it's like this
[15:37] you just can't see it because it's so
[15:39] tiny of a wedge but guess what if you're
[15:42] standing right here and you fall off on
[15:44] this side it's just like that
[15:46] how are you ever gonna get back right
[15:49] you can't you got to get back up here on
[15:52] the on the edge
[15:53] or if you fall off on this side guess
[15:55] what see this thing don't curve back
[15:57] around it just keeps going off
[16:00] that's why people in the doctrines
[16:01] unless the people come back to the true
[16:04] word of God they never come back they
[16:07] always stay off
[16:09] all right so everybody understand this I
[16:11] don't know where in the world that came
[16:12] from but that was for somebody to help
[16:15] them that's okay
[16:17] but that's what brother Brown was
[16:18] talking about when he's talking about
[16:19] hitting that Target
[16:21] and talking about the ages
[16:23] the whole time it's it's death the whole
[16:26] time
[16:27] but in this age you could sit there and
[16:30] name it
[16:31] there's death right there that
[16:34] denominational system is death right
[16:39] that's why I wait because the other ages
[16:42] that's right we winked at their
[16:45] ignorance of not being able to hit the
[16:46] target
[16:47] but they were in the age of man where
[16:50] you can only see so far but then you
[16:53] brought a prophet that was happened to
[16:54] be a marksman a hunter and he could
[16:57] describe it so simple with a gun with
[17:00] the iron sights with a v in the back and
[17:02] the Little Dot in the front that's why
[17:04] you shoot any gun same way with uh even
[17:06] with a scope you do the same thing if
[17:08] you're off you got to screw that thing
[17:10] back where it moves over and you're and
[17:11] you're hitting dead on all right but if
[17:13] not the further you go 100 yards 200
[17:17] yards 300 yards it's just like a wedge
[17:19] so you never come back unless you come
[17:21] right back to the original go back to
[17:23] your bench
[17:25] get back lined up with the Old and New
[17:27] Testament well he called those sites
[17:30] right the Old and New Testament the Holy
[17:31] Spirit leading all right then that gun
[17:34] fires right all right that's what he's
[17:36] doing in this end time
[17:38] he's got us firing the bullet right all
[17:40] right so
[17:42] let's read
[17:47] take our books back out here
[17:51] I read the whole four steel this morning
[17:53] so I needed to read it over again I
[17:54] guess huh
[17:56] all right
[17:58] let's read right here and I'll show you
[18:00] paragraph one
[18:03] 54.
[18:05] if my arms were
[18:09] all right
[18:10] 154.
[18:14] now God only knows how many he calls to
[18:16] spiritually die by this anti-bible word
[18:18] teaching
[18:20] this is the one he put 68 million to the
[18:22] store and killed him and probably
[18:25] literally millions
[18:28] billions died spiritually
[18:31] on his false teaching
[18:34] no wonder he could take the name of
[18:36] death see the writer the first place was
[18:38] an antichrist he was death to begin with
[18:40] but he was innocent
[18:42] then he received a crown a triple crown
[18:45] and when he did
[18:46] he be United Satan United in his church
[18:49] and state because he was over both of
[18:51] them Antichrist was Satan
[18:53] in the form of a man right
[18:56] so now let's go over to the next page
[18:58] and brother Brown is going to explain
[19:02] let's go to paragraph what is that 160.
[19:07] he's going to explain
[19:11] now I want you to notice the four of
[19:13] them notice the off Mark of four of the
[19:16] spiritual mathematics not as threes this
[19:18] is four he is in four here first
[19:22] Antichrist White
[19:24] second false prophet red third biker of
[19:28] heavens and earth and purgatory black
[19:31] fourth the Beast Pale Horse Satan being
[19:35] kicked
[19:36] Out of Heaven
[19:39] but where's he being kicked out of
[19:40] heaven he was kicked out of heaven a
[19:42] long time ago by Michael and his angels
[19:44] to come down here to do his business
[19:45] among us but
[19:47] God knew that
[19:50] God give us provision
[19:53] okay
[19:54] send it coming south all right to do
[20:02] or to to when I say do the Plan of
[20:05] Redemption but it is it's to do the Plan
[20:06] of Redemption that's what he come to do
[20:08] because we were lost now go to paragraph
[20:09] 166.
[20:14] just exactly like the church grows his
[20:16] church went from Antichrist or false
[20:18] prophet and in a great age to come to
[20:20] Beast that is to rise show the church it
[20:22] comes the same way through justification
[20:24] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:26] is Christ being in the people just
[20:28] exactly and he's got the answer type of
[20:31] it over here see the top of it rather or
[20:33] hears exactly that's him he's kicked out
[20:35] of heaven and he reads revelation 13.
[20:38] one through eight and we'll not read
[20:40] that
[20:41] right now
[20:43] all right
[20:45] we'll read that in just a second but
[20:46] let's stop right here so we've got our
[20:49] false anointing
[20:52] and then we've got our true anointing
[20:53] which is what the eagle
[20:55] the eagle anointing
[20:58] death and Hell on Earth
[21:01] now watch The Last Enemy to be destroyed
[21:05] that
[21:07] kind of fitting that it's in the fourth
[21:08] age and the Rapture takes flight takes
[21:10] place in a for sale
[21:13] he said well there's there's three more
[21:16] that's true
[21:19] but there's no more combat beasts
[21:22] remember there was lion oxman and white
[21:24] eagle
[21:25] four
[21:27] bugs eat it down four combat beasts had
[21:30] to come back and restore it in the Book
[21:32] of Joel and also in the Book of Ezekiel
[21:35] you'll see this line oxman and eagle
[21:37] could happen any other age had to happen
[21:40] in our age but see they weren't required
[21:46] to learn about death so they were going
[21:48] to die
[21:49] they were going to die anyway all right
[21:51] and that's just truth they died they're
[21:54] dead aren't they yeah okay and everybody
[21:56] from today match Dead all right that's
[21:59] just a fact that's just things we have
[22:00] to live with
[22:01] but there's got to be a group that's we
[22:03] which are alive and remain which is
[22:04] overcome the what
[22:06] the Bible says overcome the Beast
[22:08] and his teaching all right so we had to
[22:10] overcome because see like Mom said God
[22:13] winked at the ignorance of even there's
[22:15] going to be let me let you in on a
[22:17] little secret
[22:19] there's going to be Catholics
[22:23] those original first Catholics there's
[22:24] going to be in heaven
[22:26] they're going to have it
[22:27] they accepted Jesus Christ they lived
[22:30] the best they could they they live
[22:32] Luther's age Wesley's age Columbus age
[22:35] all those people they're born again
[22:37] believers
[22:38] sure they come out of that system
[22:42] but you're going to see a lot of people
[22:43] now I don't know if they'll ever be a
[22:44] pope in heaven but
[22:46] there were some sincere ones they may be
[22:48] giving eternal life I don't know for
[22:50] what they believe you know you never
[22:52] know
[22:53] but
[22:54] watch how it Narrows just like we're
[22:56] talking about this wedge
[22:59] but see it's narrowing this way up for
[23:01] us
[23:02] because it's coming out of denominations
[23:04] up to what what do you think that right
[23:06] there is
[23:09] thank you there's your headstone right
[23:11] there we got it we don't have to we're
[23:13] not required to come down here
[23:17] we're required to be right here
[23:19] right headstone
[23:22] well
[23:23] same way the Beast is doing the same
[23:25] thing he's trying to get you away from
[23:27] it
[23:28] right
[23:30] Christ is trying to get you right here
[23:32] that's right right at that Pinnacle
[23:35] that's where we're at there's nothing
[23:36] else left there's no more Church ages
[23:38] there's no more prophets the next thing
[23:41] we do is we go on a Rapture right so the
[23:45] Raptor takes place on the fourth seal
[23:47] because the combat beasts are gone and
[23:49] the combat Beast are
[23:51] to work you put all those combat beats
[23:54] into two words Holy Ghost
[23:57] those combat beasts are what they're the
[23:59] Lamb's protection or they are to protect
[24:02] the word of God well where's the word of
[24:04] God
[24:05] foreign
[24:06] on a piece of paper
[24:09] That's what Satan wants it to be stay on
[24:11] a piece of paper
[24:12] but when it's right here then you've got
[24:14] every combat Beast right here with you
[24:15] today lion bold
[24:18] Ox sacrificial
[24:20] right intelligence of a man to whip the
[24:23] devil because man's intelligence can't
[24:24] do it it's got to be the intelligence of
[24:25] God okay and then the eagle we got to
[24:28] get out of here we gotta you know get up
[24:31] out of this place move sword
[24:33] right so you got Co one two three and
[24:38] we're at number four right because I
[24:39] want you to understand this today
[24:42] if the Rapture takes place on a fourth
[24:45] seal
[24:47] what what about five six and seven so
[24:50] this is important the four seal is very
[24:52] important because it's a bridge
[24:55] it fills in kind of a gap it's a it's it
[24:57] fills in a there's a meaning here all
[25:00] right
[25:02] so let's do this real slow this will be
[25:05] the last point then we'll pick it back
[25:06] up next Sunday
[25:08] see a one two three and four what
[25:11] justification
[25:14] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[25:16] and brother Brown says the word or the
[25:18] word and I say the word incarnate
[25:22] all right
[25:23] if the word's not incarnate we don't go
[25:25] into Rapture that's right
[25:27] if we're if the word is not incarnate
[25:29] into people we don't want a Rapture you
[25:31] can't take a change unless your word
[25:32] incarnate now these people were the word
[25:34] for their day
[25:36] but brother Brown you read that right
[25:37] there it says we read it one
[25:40] justification I wrote in here just in
[25:42] case sanctification baptism the Holy
[25:44] Ghost is Christ being in the people
[25:47] number four see it was Christ in the
[25:49] people here but we're talking about
[25:51] incarnate
[25:52] because Satan doesn't know how to
[25:54] Incarnate flesh yet
[25:55] but when he sees us go up
[25:59] and how it's done
[26:02] he comes right in and incarnates a beast
[26:04] and does his work just like God comes in
[26:06] and incarnates you and does his work
[26:07] changes your body
[26:09] saw something today I want to read it
[26:12] where brother Brown was talking about
[26:13] and I think that maybe when I got up
[26:15] early this morning because I'd really
[26:16] been looking for a quote for that I
[26:18] found it right there in the Forest Hill
[26:20] kind of strange huh
[26:22] all right now seal one two three and
[26:25] four
[26:26] is a type of your journey here on Earth
[26:29] correct right
[26:31] right all right fifth seal six seals
[26:34] seventh seal happens after we're gone
[26:37] the literal
[26:39] actually all these literally happen
[26:41] while we're gone okay but
[26:45] for us to get out of here
[26:47] there's one group of people this is one
[26:50] group right here this could be
[26:52] potentially the dead in Christ
[26:56] because there's nothing puts them in a
[26:58] body change
[27:01] okay
[27:02] okay brother random was standing with
[27:05] the adoption what we've been preaching
[27:07] on adoption
[27:08] he was standing adopted son of God he
[27:10] still died
[27:11] all right this is the dead in Christ
[27:16] that's their requirement is to be
[27:19] justified Sanctified filled with the
[27:20] Holy Ghost and walk in the word of your
[27:22] day right
[27:24] one more group of people left
[27:29] First Corinthians or second Corinthians
[27:31] we which are what alive
[27:47] um
[27:48] pay attention
[27:50] this gets you in the body of Christ this
[27:52] does not get you a body change
[27:55] it puts you toward one
[27:57] all right but she toured one
[28:01] but even being the word incarnate
[28:04] Jesus was a word incarnate brother
[28:05] random to me was the word incarnate for
[28:07] his day for his day he wasn't God but he
[28:10] died humanly he died his flesh died all
[28:13] right
[28:15] five six and seven comes right back
[28:18] under this
[28:21] and you go back through because remember
[28:23] we're going to get into the fifth seal
[28:24] which is Grace
[28:26] six seal which is sanctification
[28:29] and then this is the what this is the
[28:32] getting out of here
[28:34] that's remember brother Ryan said Jesus
[28:36] preached six seals and he was the
[28:38] seventh
[28:40] he was the seventh he took a body change
[28:43] now we know he died but he died for me
[28:45] and you so that we wouldn't have to die
[28:47] that's the difference he died so we
[28:49] wouldn't have to he marred his body so
[28:51] our body don't have to be marked right
[28:54] are we okay yes yes I'm not stealing
[28:57] anything or breaking anybody's
[29:00] thoughts or processor
[29:03] what if you don't understand what would
[29:06] help me
[29:07] brother random come he did come to tell
[29:09] us how to live
[29:11] but after 63 when that he said that's
[29:15] what the message was done that is it
[29:18] your body Soul and Spirit
[29:21] paper ratchet right and the other ages
[29:24] did not have that that's right and
[29:26] that's why he had to come here
[29:28] none of them back there were stored it
[29:31] 100 percent brother Brown restored it
[29:33] 100 and that's how you can have a
[29:37] hundred percent word and go interact or
[29:39] go be chat
[29:45] what he done if you want to really just
[29:48] categorize it this was 63 and back
[29:52] and this was 63 and up
[29:56] you can't do it without either one
[30:00] this is pre-63. listen people these
[30:04] people that are born again Christian
[30:05] that'll never know the revelation of
[30:08] these Salem
[30:10] so it's not a requirement that these
[30:12] seals are revealed to you to be a
[30:13] born-again Christian
[30:15] everybody understand that I mean I know
[30:17] we we preached that you know God know
[30:19] the seals no you need to get born again
[30:21] first sure but it is to take a it is to
[30:26] take a nap to get out to take a body
[30:27] change you've got to get all of them
[30:28] that's right but when brother Brown says
[30:31] the bride goes up on the fourth seal
[30:33] people go cuckoo because they say man
[30:35] there's five six and seven left well
[30:38] five six and seven is for the people
[30:39] that are alive and remain
[30:42] you get all these together and you'll
[30:44] not see death
[30:48] so see a one through four
[30:52] there's four anybody that's dead and
[30:55] gone on and we've not broke any part of
[30:58] the brother Reynolds message we've not
[31:00] broken any Scripture we're going to
[31:02] prove it a little bit later on I don't
[31:03] have time maybe we'll do it this next
[31:05] week
[31:07] but the sixth fifth seal six seal
[31:09] seventh seal to me are very important if
[31:11] you want to really hone into something
[31:14] if you're born again and you're walking
[31:15] in a word there's no bigger word if if
[31:18] you're born again walking in the word
[31:19] then you've got these four
[31:23] then we need to know about Grace and
[31:26] sanctification because this is nothing
[31:28] else but justification over again
[31:30] sanctification over again baptism of the
[31:33] Holy Ghost addicts Apex pinnacle
[31:36] because all this right here is Ephesians
[31:39] 4 is Ephesians 1
[31:41] where this is the earnest of our
[31:43] inheritance right here
[31:45] until the what full purchased possession
[31:49] Jesus didn't come just to purchase your
[31:51] soul
[31:52] when he dripped his blood on the earth
[31:54] it's in here brother Brown and it's in
[31:57] the future home brother Brian said your
[31:59] body was in this earth when it first
[32:01] begun
[32:02] he just dropped his blood on it cleansed
[32:05] and claimed this whole entire Earth and
[32:07] that's where your body was so your
[32:08] body's already been claimed but what
[32:10] happens is this guy right here
[32:14] racks through this thing right here
[32:17] stops this right here
[32:19] that's just about as simple you put all
[32:21] the message you want to in it you can
[32:23] make all the quotes you want but that's
[32:25] what it is God's already done this
[32:28] waiting on you and I
[32:29] Satan's in a battle
[32:32] but now see if we were not ever able to
[32:34] name death we never could overcome it
[32:37] that's what we're getting to next we got
[32:39] to be able to overcome death but he had
[32:40] to have a name first we had to have a
[32:42] name brother Brown had to come and say
[32:43] hey the eagle age had to bring a name
[32:46] to death well now what named death
[32:50] no it was it was named organization
[32:55] false Doctrine
[32:57] something that's keeping you out of the
[32:59] Rapture whatever that is that's death
[33:01] it ain't physical death like I said
[33:03] we've named physical deaths at stable
[33:04] died right yeah so it was the spiritual
[33:08] part so let's read this right here I
[33:10] want to find it and read it
[33:12] something I found this morning
[33:18] somebody had had a question
[33:21] about
[33:23] creation
[33:25] now listen
[33:27] go to paragraph
[33:29] what is that 282 282.
[33:35] let's go to 281.
[33:38] paragraph 281. now listen to this don't
[33:40] you listen
[33:42] as I said
[33:46] as I said God is like a big contractor
[33:49] he lays out all his material on the
[33:51] Earth
[33:52] then he builds his buildings now
[33:54] remember before there was a grain of of
[33:56] seed on the Earth
[33:58] before there was a son that ever struck
[34:00] the Earth your body was laying on the
[34:02] Earth
[34:04] because you are the dust of the earth
[34:06] see you are God is the contractor now
[34:10] the way he was going to do it
[34:13] now some people thinks that maybe Adam
[34:15] was going to speak into Eve and she was
[34:17] going to conceive and have a baby
[34:18] through her womb Listen People
[34:21] God only gave us these bodies he knew we
[34:24] were going to reproduce sexually okay
[34:26] he knew that but he gave us these bodies
[34:29] because we're a higher creation of
[34:30] animal
[34:32] a male dog let's just be playing a male
[34:34] dog's got a thing like a male animal
[34:36] does I mean like a male human does why
[34:38] we're the higher creation when God put
[34:40] us in this flesh he could make us
[34:42] something different than his creation
[34:45] he created a male and a female dog to
[34:47] procreate right so he gave us male and
[34:51] female parts in our human body
[34:55] but not to do that listen watch this
[34:57] right here
[34:59] now the way he was going to do it was
[35:02] reach down and get like he did Adam
[35:07] a little bunch of calcium potash and
[35:09] Cosmic light and go
[35:11] there's my other son
[35:14] see then he'd bring up some more and say
[35:18] there's another one
[35:20] spoken word but what did Eve do she
[35:23] corrupted that way and she brought it
[35:25] through a sexual act then death struck
[35:30] now
[35:31] what is God going to do keep reading
[35:34] he's got so many of those seeds down
[35:36] through there that's predestinated so
[35:38] much to predestinate and then at the end
[35:41] time he won't say Eve come bear another
[35:44] child
[35:46] hmm
[35:47] here
[35:49] call and I'll answer that's all that's
[35:53] it that's the idea
[35:56] period
[35:58] so in the beginning
[36:00] sure he gave us human part male and
[36:02] female parts but only because he put us
[36:04] in a higher form of animal creation
[36:06] right yeah we weren't supposed to
[36:08] produce sexually
[36:10] we were supposed to produce by the
[36:11] spoken word why is why he preach spoken
[36:14] words Original Seed spoken word is the
[36:16] Original Seed it was supposed to go Adam
[36:18] or I would say you had a part of it
[36:21] because she was Adam she wasn't Eve she
[36:23] was Adam
[36:25] but you there you go
[36:28] he didn't have to bring I don't have a
[36:29] loom did he no and Adam wasn't going to
[36:33] be the one that spoke the dog was gonna
[36:34] be the one that saw you well now Adam
[36:36] was one of them sure he was God of the
[36:38] earth that's what he was saying he said
[36:39] he'd give it just like he did Adam
[36:41] and
[36:43] coach God Adam was given the book to
[36:46] reproduce
[36:47] Genesis 1 26 and 27 says multiplying
[36:49] replenish the Earth before they ever put
[36:51] us in a human body
[36:52] So Adam when he put that into Adam he
[36:54] didn't change it
[36:56] that's what's happening now brother down
[36:58] started with 18 people well I say this
[37:01] all the time but sometimes it don't go
[37:02] strike home brother now started with 18
[37:05] people 30 years ago 40 years ago
[37:08] he's got a hundred now
[37:11] they're not Mama's kids
[37:15] but they're brother Dale's kids they're
[37:18] spiritually brother Dale's kids we're
[37:20] all brother Dale's kids spiritually
[37:22] that spiritual reproduction that's
[37:25] Genesis one that's why I love that
[37:27] scripture so much that's me and you
[37:29] being reproduced right here or produced
[37:32] not reproduced but being produced right
[37:33] here with no sex involved that's one of
[37:36] these you see these preachers go out and
[37:38] do the things they do and and have
[37:40] relations with women because it's so
[37:41] close you can preach it so close to you
[37:44] and get in the flesh and that's what
[37:46] this guy wants
[37:47] he wants you to get in the flesh
[37:49] and do things but God sent the Holy
[37:52] Ghost to get us a holy ghost in here to
[37:55] work on this outside guy all right so
[37:57] see you one two four Rapture takes place
[37:59] everybody understand that the reason the
[38:01] Rapture takes place there's a group that
[38:03] takes these brings it right back into
[38:05] here and death doesn't bother him
[38:07] anymore
[38:08] it'll never hit him may just be one
[38:11] person maybe two people maybe ten maybe
[38:14] a thousand it ain't gonna be many
[38:17] but these were dead in Christ
[38:19] they arise first because these don't
[38:22] have to rise
[38:23] they never died they're going up that's
[38:26] why the Raptor takes place on the fourth
[38:27] step there's no more combat beats the
[38:29] Holy Ghost Lift Off the Earth guess what
[38:31] you and I live with it
[38:32] ain't gonna leave the Holy Ghost here
[38:34] because if we leave the Holy Ghost here
[38:35] you still got kids here right right yeah
[38:37] you don't have kids no more so he's gone
[38:39] he don't have to be here all right let's
[38:40] go
[38:41] God bless you
