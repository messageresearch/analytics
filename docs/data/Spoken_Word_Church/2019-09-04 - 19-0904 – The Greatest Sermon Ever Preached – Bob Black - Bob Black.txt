sermons they might be who is this fella what does he think but anyway well we'll get into we'll get into it here so Matthew chapter 26 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we thank you so much for your many mercies and for your grace to a slow God and we know Lord Jesus Eve calls us to be a special people with a special privileges Lord and tonight Lord I believe that one of our special privileges Lord is to have a to be able to feast on that hidden manna that special revelation of your word has been stored up until this day Lord God the Lord we come expecting tonight Lord Jesus expecting to look into your word expecting to receive something in Lord and expecting to be changed that's my desire Lord God every time we come to the house of the Lord to be changed Lord Jesus

Lord is tonight Lord Jesus you'll do something special for your people or God and maybe some the lost would realize that they don't have what they think they have and maybe the ones that do have something will realize what they do have Lord God and I pray Lord that you'll just be with us all tonight Lord God and open up the ears of the hears Lord Jesus and open up my mouth or speaker truth Lord God granted Lord that you'll put your words in my mouth tonight Lord Jesus and she'll be with us and bless our gathering Lord Jesus we pray and we ask this blessing over your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Matthew chapter 26 verse 34 to 46 and it says at third verse 34 jesus said unto Him verily I say unto thee that this night before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise I also said all the disciples he is very boastful I believe Peter was about to come to a realization that maybe he didn't quite have what he thought he did then come with Jesus with him unto a place called Gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while I go and pray Andre and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then say a thing under them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tear you here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt and he cometh under the disciples and findeth him asleep and saith unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away the second time and prayed saying O my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done and he came and found him asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hours at hand and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise and let us be going behold he is at hand that does betray me he may be seated the Lord out his blessing to the reading of the word now maybe just to get a little bit of context of the scripture before I kind of get into them into the message tonight is that Jesus this was really the culmination of Jesus's life the thing that he was been had been born to fulfill was to give his life on the cross and now it had gone through you you can kind of see the journey this every every believers got to go through the same journey that Christ went through the same baptized on the river Jordan adopted on the mountain on all of the different things that that show the progression of a believer especially in this age because in this sage we've got access to the headstone something that all that although all the other Church ages we're looking for it but we have access to this the complete journey of Jesus Christ and now he comes to the end of the road and and and the thing that he had been born to fulfill and and brother Brent talks about how he battles like a battle in the garden because Gethsemane means the depressing place the place where the wine is pressed out and so there in that back in that garden he began to battle and you could see maybe the devil over there sitting waiting in the wings to see is he really gonna go through with it is he gonna really give his life is he and maybe brother enema s he dramatized that he would say well you know Jesus is there praying and calling out to the Father asking is there is there may be another way that this can be fulfilled do I have to give my life is there maybe somebody else could give their life or something else could be done to save these people that were lost back there in the Garden of Eden that is there anything else that could be done and any he pray through and he began to began to call out and and because what he's doing is he's he's battling through the last remaining vestige of any kind of anything in his humanity that would prevent him from feeling it fulfilling God's Word you said when he came through that battle when he came through that battle and stepped out see the battle was over he had all he had to do was just go fulfill the Word of God all he had to do was just go walk to the cross because the battle was won there in the Garden of Gethsemane the battle was won and so when he stepped his foot out of that garden what you see there is a life above the life released a life above God of power and that's really where I'm getting my money the title of the night sermon the greatest sermon ever preached the greatest sermon ever preached would be the life of Christ on display where the whole word the devil himself could look at the life of cross being displayed in the man and say there goes a real Christian there goes a real son and daughter of God and as you see as Jesus put his life on display and took that journey to the cross all the people that looked at him could not help but be influenced by this man's life by the actions that he took so let's let's kind of follow him as he walked as he took this journey to the cross in Matthew 26 48 through 50 it says now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever I shall kiss that same as he hold him fast and forthwith he came to Jesus and said hail master and kiss him now let's just think about this look this is the man that had been in the ranks of the disciples and posed as a real believer and now had been had was going to be the one to betray Jesus now if you think think about the way that brother Branham treated people that hated him think about the way that Jews that Jesus treated this man that betrayed and that sold him for thirty pieces of silver here he is betraying him with a kiss and Jesus responds with the word friend friend where for that heart now come the life of Christ was the life of God was so displayed in this man that you could not tell who his enemy were when he said they're at communion with all of his disciples the disciples were wandering within themselves at me that's going to betray him who's he talking about they didn't say it was Judas they could not tell who Jesus knew who who it was that was going to betray him listen if you if you friends if we could have a life of Christ so displayed like that well you can't tell who your enemy is well you can't tell you you secretly are wondering about it you secretly wondered what is this one a real genuine believer or not but you know so many times this is so visible and on display who we like and who we don't like before conform cliques and form clans and we like this person we like that person but with Jesus you couldn't tell you couldn't tell who his friend wasn't who who was enemy was I was I was wondering whether this was going to preach or teach tonight so let me see if I can calm down so I can deliver this a little bit in Luke chapter 22 verse 49 to 51 it says when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto Him Lord shall we smite with the sword so they came they came to take him away and his disciples began to realize that he was there to take him and Peter's response Peters response was select so many people in the message so many people on the run to believe in campus I got a sword in my hand I know what to do with it I'm just going to start whacking with it and it says one of them smoke the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear you know so many times somebody tell you no the sword of the world that God has given into our hand is not for us to smite our brothers it's not for us to smite the service of the high priest he gave us the sword of the world to smite the devil with it but it's not to smite one another and he give us that word so many times we don't which seems like we don't know what to do with it and I believe that's what the new birth is given for the new birth is given to give us wisdom to know what to do with the word with the theology that we built with the doctrine that we've been given to know what to do with the mechanics that we've been given to know how to drive the car how to pilot how to pilot it how to do it how to move in the right channels with the right approach to God is and jesus answered and said suffer you thus far as in other words that's it that's enough of that and he touched his ear and He healed him he pictures they reach down and he picked his ear up and he put his ear but you know so many times it seems like that's what the ministry kind of has to do or a believers come back behind other other believers are scar and other ones that they have to smooth things over patch the patch everything up the pastor has to come come around behind somebody that's causing the scar it's causing a great big turmoil smooth everything up heal everything heal the wounds but brother if we could have really the life of Christ on display in our life the life of Christ where we could love one another and really really show meekness and humility and had put the others before ourselves and Luke chapter 22 verse 54 says then they took him and laid him and brought him into the high priests house it seems like so many times we weren't able to be laid we want our way we would rather take our way than the gospel way when we read the message we like I like I don't know if that's what it says we'll come to church to listen to the pastor listen to the minister well I don't know if that's quite what that says and we'll argue with the word but if you can be in subjection to the world and allow you like a lamb oh we're sheep we've got to be led but well you know we'll struggle and fight and stress about things well instead of just allowing the Shepherd to lead us and keep on reading to verse 63 and the men that held Jesus mocked him and smote him and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smoked thee and you see Jesus allowed them to smite him on this cheek and mocks him and call him things and we can barely suffer somebody to disagree with our doctrine if somebody from another church says well I disagree with you did we get all riled up and begin to get off stinky within ourselves and I just fuss and fume about things because we can't hardly we can't hardly stand for somebody to disagree with us it seems like listen if Jesus was able to be mocked and slapped across the face and and humiliated publicly before people can't we stand a little chastise but can't we stand a little rebuke you know brother Brown said and from that time he said today we got the wrong conception of power power is overcoming returning good for evil that's real power that can love your enemy do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's God power and I want to say that's a real that's the greatest sermon that could ever be preached that's a sermon that will convict your family that will cause your loved ones to come to God a sermon that will because look love is what caused the bull to stop in his trap love is what caused the ELA jackets to return back in their hole love is what will cause your family to realize that there's something to this message I think sometimes we want to approach other people that disagree with us like Peter with that sword whacking off body parts but if we just love one another love is the great Conqueror and I tell you you can't how can you love somebody unless you've got that real pillar of fire down on the inside of your soul the life of Christ down on you to manifest the greatest sermon that could ever be preached to preach a sermon of love to other people have you can't manifest that unless you're born again I believe that's what the new birth was given forward to manifest the love of Christ to manifest the life of Christ to preach a sermon to other people that will cause them to realize that there really is something true to this message you know you hear people say that people are beginning to lose faith and and what what the new birth really is they're losing confidence that the new birth can can take you away from the things of this world all these doctors that are starting up about it well even after the new birth you still gonna have trouble with with pornography and adultery and all this kind of thing that's a bunch of tommyrot when you gets a new birth it'll still a purge all that stuff out of you that's what we need the new birth for brother Branham said in divine love and Sovereign Grace he said I'd say Lord take all the gifts and let me have the love see for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of God is the motive behind the gift we must have loved the life of Christ manifested in that man and if the life of Christ could be manifested in that man he could be manifest in us too because he's given us power through the new birth let's read in Luke chapter 23 mmm-hmm because then he was taken before Pilate and it says in Pilate me when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people said unto them you have brought this man unto me as one that perverted the people and behold I having examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching these things whereof ye accuse him in other words the devil or the Roman system the Roman government had had himself examined this man listen you've got to face the hall of critics too you have to be examined by the devil because brother Graham said that you could get to a place a believer could get to a place a believer can grow into a place where the devil don't know what to do with you and the devil's looking her all around he knows all of your weak spots and he's examining you trying to find a way to get to you but when you grow into a place into the statue of a perfect man into the statue of Christ where Christ is manifesting himself through you manifesting the works of God through your members and the devil looks at you and said I don't know what to do with this man then you'll be like Pilate examining as I said looking at Jesus and saying I've examined this man and I find no fault in him in other words he is so justified that I can't I can't find anything this man is just this man has come to a place of justification that I don't even know I can't even look at all the way back in his life I can't find anything wrong listen we're coming to a place where a place of justification whether real you never did it to begin with you never the real you never did it to begin with he said no nor had Herod for I sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto Him neither Pilate nor Herod could find any fault in this man because see the life of Christ the life of God was being manifested in this met through this man so much that all through this journey from the Garden of Gethsemane to the cross he was influencing people he was influencing Peter he was influencing Pilate and Herod he was influencing the thief on the cross and Luke 23 it says in one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying just not thou fear God seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our water our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise in other words listen Jesus was not preaching a great big sermon Jesus did not have to tell the thief on the cross he did not have to expound to him all the mysteries and all the things that expects playing all this great deep doctrine all the thief did was he looked at that man he just turned and the life was bone display so much that he was convicted with an m7 he said this man we're guilty but this man is listen if we could live a life with the life of Christ was so much on display that when you're walking through your workplace we're carrying your little lunch box when you're just going about your daily duties like the drunk man there brother Brent talked about they came home and his wife was just singing there she watched on the Worcester floor and and the man and his friend that was with him was so convicted that they fell on their face and gave their heart to the Lord that that is the life of Christ on display that's a soul and in life that's the kind of life that other people going to look to and say ah there's got to be something to this that's that's the greatest sermon that could ever be preached when Jesus when he had cried in Matthew 27 and verse 52 54 Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom of the earth to quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after he's a resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared on the Meeny now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and these things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of God the Centurion and all that were with him saw all these things that were done and it wasn't that they heard a great big sermon preached but they saw the sermon of his life lived and they were convicted they knew that something had to be to have taken this was no ordinary man and it's no ordinary man when an adopted son of God a so adopted child of God walks on the earth it's no ordinary man when when brother Branham spoke to the wind and and it's the snowstorm and had moved back when he spoke to the little fishie and his life with the life of that little fishie came back into itself it's no ordinary man with a real child of God was walking on the earth moving in the life of Christ is made manifest in them that's the greatest sermon ever preached listen there is power than the Holy Ghost there's power in the life lived by the by the word is power this is not just some psychology I think so many times people try to find the problem in their life or in their family or their loved ones but trying to go fight go back to psychology listen let's see if we can get to the root of the problem what do you think about this what do you think about that I think so many times the problem is that we need to go back to whether or not you're born again or not the way the problem of adultery and fornication and all these sin all this sinful living our lack of holiness it's not that you're not just just thinking about the May issue right that's not that you don't listen you deal with whether or not be you're a Republican or Democrat or all those kind of things the problem goes back to the soul problem it's a Salvation issue it's a problem whether or not the life of Christ is abiding down on your soul or not I think so many times we have we made we made that we will make the new birth something that is not we made it just like learning about things we've made it education we made it well you just come to church and just learn about learn about the word and everything but it's the life of Christ manifested in the believer it's God living inside of you listen brother Bram said he said in his your life worthy of the gospel he said oh God let me behold both my hands to God before this audience let me live like that let this word so become that me and this word is the same thing let my words be this word let the meditation in my heart let him be in my heart on my mind tie his Commandments to upon this the post of my intelligence tie them upon the posts in my heart let me just see him when temptation Rises let me see Christ when things go wrong let me just see him when I get ready and then enemy enemy try to make me get angry let me see Jesus what would he do what would he want the life of Christ to be made manifest in me because brother branham sitting in the ephesian church change he said a life lived by the word would be the word express in other words it's a sermon being preached it's a expression the very expression of the Eternal Word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word expressly lived out in the believer just lived without maybe even say anything is an expression of God to the people the works that I do bear witness of me brother and priest in 1951 he said do you know I'd rather you live me a sermon than preach me one it'll be a better evidence that you're a Christian isn't that right to live a sermon and what we are is what we live what we do our actions shows what we are and God keeps his word in 1957 he said I tell you the reason I love to hear brother Neville speak not mainly because he's a good preacher but because I know that he lives what he preaches and I would rather you would live me a sermon than preach me one it'll be more effective it'll be more effective in another place he talks about brother Neville and he says I've searched his life back how would you like to have your life searched back by prophet and he said I've searched his life back and he's actually living what he's preaching and the lamb in the dove 1957 brother Branham said now no matter how much you preach you got a real ill temper don't do you much good to preach you see no matter how much you joined church and try to impersonate if you're crabbing and nasty with your neighbour you'll never win into Christ then see it's the fruit of the Spirit as my wife used to tell me actions speak louder than words that's right leave me a sermon instead of preaching me one that's a good thing to live me a sermon and I believe that this message has given us the power to live a sermon where we could we could look at a believers life and be amazed at the power of God that would give them that kind of patience that kind of temperance where somebody would say something horrible to you or disagree with you or whatever and the life of God is so flowing through you that somebody would be amazed at the amount of patience that will be manifest in that believers life I believe that's what the little kind of life that we should be that we should strive for because listen the reason that people the the world is hungry and thirsting for a real life the life of Christ on display and that's what that's what causes P to come to church what causes people to come to church and follow after the the gospel that you proclaim to believe is a fire burnin I imagine maybe one time when when the children of Israel me just talk brother ba the children of history were down in Egypt in and they were putting the land that killing the lamb and putting the blood over the lintel of their door and maybe there might be a little prodigal son wandering by and wandering by his parents home that night and he looked in and he saw a fire blazing and what was on that fire was a lamb being roasted and that lamb was the attraction for them maybe it maybe it's time for me to come home maybe it's time for me to turn in and you see the fire the fire the gospel is what attracts people with somebody come to church and they see a church on fire a Church of the Living God being made manifest so that'll make somebody hunger and thirst when they see a the fire of God the fire of God is what they followed in the wilderness they followed that pillar of fire but that fire of God has put inside of you the believers through the New Testament covenant what is that fire the fire manifests love you meant that story that brother Brown I'm told about Burt call that he said the meanest man and he and he and he went out there any hunting and he'd always tried to be real mean to brother branham money and you know try to kill the little baby deers when it it didn't even need any meat or anything and brother branham said one one time he got that little call and he could call the little deer out and and a mother deer the little mama deer with all that love of a mother stepped out and said I would be willing to die I know there's a hundred he saw the love with that little mother deer step out and he knew that if a little mama deer could love its baby that much that there had to be the love of God so that's the love that their brother branham and they'd be talking about the love he saw real love on display when somebody comes to church and they see real Christian love on display they see that's the fire of the gospel they don't draw him to the word that are drawn and then they'll know that it's not just words on a page because listen you can't get warm by painted fire you can't get warm by just ink on the page just think but when you come when you see the wink as it risen off of the page and it's room Ana festered in the life of a believer you can you can barely up around that and warm your hands by that that's something that'll be a benefit to a believer or an unbeliever anybody Monica said one time when I was preaching somewhere she said I thought you about to pass out breathing in the combat Olivia I'm all right so I'm gonna changed direction a little bit and and talked about you see when the in in the Old Testament when a believer a believer would be or an unbeliever either way would be attracted by the fire of the tabernacle so now I'm kind of getting into what I was talking about in Sunday school but attracted attracted to that that at brazen altar that was sitting out there in the out of court I see all those things you you want to have the life of Christ what what you need to do is go look at that Tabernacle and see the experience of the believer going through because each one of those little pit furniture in the tabernacle it's one of those furnishings speaks of the walk of the believer are going through and the first step is to look at that brazen altar and say there's a fire burning there's a fire burning and then attracts you there's a fire burning and there's a lamb being roasted or there's a sacrifice being offered and the believer the unbeliever turns aside and they go through that gate of the outer court because jesus said i am the gate i am the door By Me If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture and so you turn aside and go through that gate and you begin that journey you're getting taken one step after the other but that first step of the believer is the odd is that brazen altar that how our hand is moving off a fast yeah if y'all want to pull that pull that one of those slides up in the brazen altar I don't have a number anything so if you can't find it that's fine if you can there you go so they come to the Braves and why is that the very first thing when you're coming through that outer court the very first thing that a believer comes across is the brazen altar because your whole Christian journey is based upon that sacrifice Jesus given his life on the cross for you and when you look back as you're taking that journey and you remember I was there when I when I identified myself with the sacrifice I was there when I recognized the sacrifice that Jesus made for me I remember that he I know that he paid the price for all of my sins and all of my sins have been washed away all of my sins are covered by the blood of the sacrifice you see how important it is to recognize what Jesus has done for you we're not here just to learn about all the all sorts of interesting facts but we're here to learn about the price that Jesus paid for us I tend to be identified with him you see that fire that fire on the altar represents there's got to be a fire in the church to cause people to be attracted to it you say I think I think many times people get confused by statements that brother Branham made about how he'd say we were weird beyond Pentecost now and he said I'll read it for you where he said he said we're living we're living ahead of that now we are beyond Pentecost the same as we are Methodists and Lutheran and see people began to get in their head that we don't need the fire of Pentecost anymore we're beyond that he's not talking about the original Pentecost he's not talking about the original faith of the disciples he's talking about their Zuza Street Pentecost we moved ahead from from Lutheran Methodist the Pentecostal and they denominated they form denominations and we just that the word has kept moving on but we're not moving on Pat we're the the Malachi message was sent to restore us back to the original faith of the fathers to that original fire and that original fire should be burning in the heart of every believer you see this outer court when a believer when an unbeliever begins to go through this outer court a lot of times they mistake it's like it's like somebody a little a little young person going to a youth camp and they get in that fire and they begin to see supernatural things and they begin to maybe go through the prayer line and come out and actually see the pillar of fire listen I'll tell you what if you get to talking to some of the young people they have seen and heard and and experienced very many supernatural things supernatural things that would let it astound you really I was talking to one of the young people I'm not gonna embarrass you or call your name or anything but after youth meaning they came out of the service and they begin to hear a heavenly choir sing and sing a song and they could tell you what song it was and began to rejoice in the spirit listen there's there's supernatural things taking place when you that fire was lit by supernatural God it was not lit by man but will you get out in the outer court and you see the supernatural things you become begin to think well I'm born again or you can maybe come back from a youth camp and and maybe the people that that were not there when u s-- experienced supernatural things with will will tell you what you didn't get nothing you didn't get nothing I want to take maybe you didn't get the new birth but I tell you what when something like that happens you didn't get nothing you don't come back when somebody tells you you didn't get nothing I'll tell you what you just got to do like Ava did David didn't when they stole all his wives and stole as possession doesn't say bring me the ephod I'm gonna take God's Word I'm gonna ignore all the criticism I'm going to know all the naysayers and I'm just gonna march on with God I don't care what others say if you tell me I didn't get nothing when I know that I got when I I know that something supernatural took place listen sometimes God does something for us maybe even in our flesh maybe just an anointing on our flesh just to let us know that he cares about us and sometimes when I'm feeling bad it might not be something down in my soul but just a little quickening to my flesh I just thank God for it a blessing to my flesh will help carry you through the bad times sometimes I appreciate everything that I can get from God Ezekiel 36 it says I will take you from among the heathen which is what he's doing when you come into that outer court and he says I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you in a new spirit I will put with you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and see that scriptures what is that what is being fulfilled as you walk through the courts and you start off with that brazen altar and then you move on to the Laver because this the the believer has to be washed just like the priest was washed and you go down into the water just like Jesus what he was there at the river Jordan and John baptized him and he said I'm we've got to fulfill all the scripture all of righteousness has to be fulfilled and the believer has got to be washed you know when the children of Israel were coming out of Egypt they they crew that they killed the lamb they put the blood over the door and then they went through that there's the blade Bray's and see they rent went through the sea and as the sea washed away all of those Egyptians they could look back and say that all of our troubles that all of that all of that life all of that has been washed away when you go through that brazen sea - and wash why every time you come into the outer court every time you come to worship you must be washed of all the filthiness of the world wash it away wash it away by the water of the word that's how you wash it away the cleansing by the water of the word and then you have a right to enter into the holy place and as I watched that time slip around I'm trying to speed up a little bit but I want to just pause here for a moment because what I'm talking about is justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and sometimes it can enter into people's minds that well I've heard all this before this is a very simple message about justification sanctification badges my holy gifts why do I need to hear this over and over again because that the simplicity of the gospel is what your whole journey is based on if you fail to see st. justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost you are missing the message and you're missing the mystery of the message there's a mystery hidden within justification just sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost y'all not getting tired on me are you hang on now listen you've got to hit all the milestones because listen you could come to the church and you hear a preacher preaching this is the age of the son of man this is the age of adoption and you can you can get it within your head went into yourself well why I'm adopted I'm already but listen when a preacher is preaching with it from within the Holy of Holies he's trying to identify you with all of these different milestones and unless you have a personal experience with the golden altar and with the lampstands and with the table of showbread and with the brazen altar and with all these different way points you cannot say that you've already you come into the Holy of Holies you have to be able to look back and say I remember my experience with the left and I remember my experience at the brazen altar I remember being identified with my sacrifice I remember my sins being washed away at the Laver I remember studying the word at the table of showbread and pondering over things that I didn't understand and I remember coming to God in prayer and making my confession at the golden altar and saying I believe your word I believe now make it manifest in my life and all of those things come together you've got to remember all of those different milestones because if you just say well we're in the Holy of Holies now this is the age of the Holy of Holies this is the age of the Son of Man and you can't look back and remember where you come from it calls any question what your experience is it calls any question whether you really have what you saying yeah listen brother Brannon in the third seal he said now we find out then that these mysteries are supposed to be revealed that's what the prophet came to do to revealed and some of these mysteries involve justification sanctification the baptism holy ghost because he said just like take it on the other side there was people come in who had powers kings but wasn't keys you have to notice the Bible terminology of anything he said see now watch but the reason that all the stray ends of the mysterious part about justification the mysterious part of sanctification the mysterious part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and why what kind that he Eve eat an apple or did she eat a pomegranate or something see what was the serpent see doth and he goes on to explain all the different mysteries but see there's a mystery of justification there's a mysterious part of sanctification there's a mysterious part of the baptism of Holy Ghost what is that mystery let's see what he said in the power of transformation he said that's what we all want to do is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed that from the natural things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's Spirit by His Word in other words once you have gone through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that's not the end of the story there's more to unfold there's more to be revealed there's more and listened to many times you know I'm gonna speak to the young people now the young people could come to church and it seems so much serious and everything maybe if you even if you're a new believer well and you begin to feel within yourself that you're being left behind and you may begin within yourself beginning to grow I don't understand these things maybe somebody that just recently started coming to church and you begin to it seems I feel like everything is so deep for me I wonder if I I can't hardly grasp but I'm wonder if I'm being left behind listen God is remembering God when it was Melchizedek visited Abraham he lingered he didn't just come and leave lingered around and the Son of man has labored around the Son of Man is manifesting himself now he's lingering he's been staying with us all this time waiting on you to catch the revelation of the word he's here to make sure that you catch the word and listen I've kind of got bad news for some of the old people because you know we preach about how we're going to take a rapture but the rapture cannot come if one of these predestinated children of God has yet to receive the new birth and one of these children of God has yet to grow up that sketch of a perfect man their answer cannot take place until that happens so that's why we've got to preach with all our might we've got to encourage that all I might we've got a love with all our mics so that everyone there that last one comes in and grows up the statue of a perfect man you know many times I wonder sometimes if maybe the old ones maybe get a little bit fearful than themselves and almost neglect the young people because you know you can get within your mind you begin to think well you know what let the young people just spin for themselves we're facing to take a rapture we're fixing to get out of here listen listen that's not how the rapture works you know just before brother Graham preached the seals he preached about Christ revealed and simplicity and how God he and all made comprehensible God came down from glory to be revealed to make himself simple and God is able to come down the early disciples were not men of great intellectual renown but they were just ignorant unlearned people and you don't have to be a great big intellectual mind to understand the message the message can be made simple enough for a little child to understand it so simple that you can preach the message by talking about a grain of wheat planting in the ground and it grows up until that grass same grain of weed he's made manifest at the end of that testimony a bird in that show that's how simple the message is listen I would encourage you don't don't give up don't give up but hang it hang in there the Bible says back in Isaiah said he that believeth shall not and make haste and I'll add slow and steady wins the race he that believeth shall not make haste hang in there and just stay with the message because God has not forgotten you I already read that quote let's keep it let's keep going on now we've come through the brazen officer and come through the labor and we're coming into the holy place where there's a lot of a lot of very interesting activity going on this is the this is really the prime place where the believers the day to day to day life's activities are there's a lot going in here in the holy place because you've come from sanctification into the holy place where you're from justification into the holy place where you enter into a religious atmosphere you're coming into a place of worship you're coming into where you know the approach to God and you understand how to get to God and you're beginning to let the Bible says work out your salvation with fear and trembling work it out and you go over to the table of showbread there on the right and you would get to pour through the Scriptures like I did I remember when I went to the table of showbread I remember when I when I began to feel that pull of God on my life and I went into the message and I began to search over the scripture the thing because I wanted to know what brother Owen said about the new birth and he would say that you must have a revelation that many people think they have a revelation but you've got to you've got to you got to take that journey until God gives you a revelation of himself you've got to keep moving on until it's until you know you read you read you want to read at that table of shewbread until you have an understanding of what you're getting into and see you've got you've got three things in that holy place three things of the battleground of the believer in that sanctified realm where you're battling it out with the mind listen within that holy places where all the believers got all these all these ideas and things you come to church and you think somebody your memory reason consciousness is affecting you can begin to think that people hate you or people upset with you people are trying to subvert your authority true people people are trying to take your position in the church but listen it's in that holy place where you do battle with all that nonsense when you I believe sometimes when we get upset with one another we our problem is we haven't spent enough time at the golden altar in prayer getting rid of all the ideas that it wouldn't listen with you when you come to a sanctified place and that that holy veil shuts down around you all the things that people say about you will just fall away and it matters nothing it doesn't matter what things that you remember we're all the things that people have said about you and all those different things so you got the table of showbread eating the word it had to be replenished every seven days but it could only be eaten by the priest that the the Avenue by which the believer is sanctified by the word by eating the word and studying the word and then over on the Left you've got the the lampstands brother haven't said now the light of the court was the firmament the light of the first veil was a bunch of lamps they got smoky and went out sometime and that's the way with a man from one revival to another if he's just living in the church and having a little spurt up once in a while and he gets all fired up with the revival but a few weeks that they don't start another one somewhere he goes down smokesouth see oh my church ain't having this one in my church and you know the reason brother Branham explained that the lamp gets smoky is because it's got a old down in the bottom and and the wick is your faith and God puts it all together and makes a fire up there it's his fire burning it's the it's the genuine anointing of the Holy Ghost on your spirit burn in that file give it a fire giving you a testimony that you're you're believing you're moving on with God but the reason it begins to get smoking is everything is because you get a little let a little water get in there you little little unbelief and get in there and it gets smoky and you have to tend to it you have to you constantly having to tend to that lampstand but when you get into the Holy of Holies there's nothing to 10s it's the faith of God in that Holy of Holies listen you see we'll get back on the youth meetings again you can go to a camp or whatever you can get in there in the anointing where the Spirit of God has fallen on your spirit and you're coming into a place where you just feel you just feeling raptured you just feel amazing God is actually working in your life or or maybe use it using another example because I know some of the young people have testified that well I got down at that golden altar we'll say like this I got down to that golden altar and I began to pray and I know I felt like God Himself was standing in front of me you could you could do like what a brother brother Dale has told us before of people in his family or whatever they had prayed until they actually felt the feet of the of Jesus before them you can get into that such an anointing like that but yet you're still not in the Holy of Holies yet you still you see you can have supernatural things happen in that outer court and supernatural things supernatural events God can even speak to you in that holy place God can speak to you in prayer but yet you have still not entered into that holy up holy of Holy's what you're searching for I'll say like the dinner at the youth camp if I'm about Danny Stephen and Dwayne Lawson and all the different ones that they've got they would get up and begin to preach to the young people and they'd say what you're looking for is a revelation well every single one of them would get up and say what you're looking for is a revelation and one after the other now I believe that's if we could get really instill in them in all of us that what you're searching for is a revelation and maybe not something will make it so big like we're looking for like a great big unfolding of the seven seals to reveal that you're born again of the Daniel 7 two weeks are all these things but maybe maybe what we should be looking for is something as simple as the Lord is there which is the last the last verse in Ezekiel when the Zika was looking at that new city he said jehova shamma the Lord is there the Lord is there when God reveals himself to you that the Lord is there taking a bi abode and you and down and the innermost part of your being the Lord is there and so then you've got the the table of showbread the lampstands that have to be continually 10:00 to 2:00 in that holy place and then you've got the golden altar and the golden offer just like the left stand the golden altar was lit off of that fire from the brazen altar because you can't come to that goal and offer altar and all for the incense of Prayer on that unless it's based upon the sacrifice that was all for altar on that brazen altar out in the out of court everything your entire approach to God depends upon your face your faith that God has the sacrifice has been paid for you and when you come to that altar you're making your confession to God you're looking a man making a confession with your faith believing that what you have read in the table of showbread what you heard from God's Word that you believe it and you're coming within a golden altar with the fire of that little bit of your revelation burning and you're coming with your confession and moving forward because it's your faith until you move into the Holy of Holies and God recognizes that your faith has been accepted and then he gives you his faith and that's the difference that's the difference between the outer court and their holy of holy the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies I know I'm going a little bit fast hey you know what I almost say it's a little bit it's fine if you want to close your eyes or whatever just go back and listen to it I know some of you will go back and pore over it again so that's fine if you I just want to I just want to take a little bit of time and just lay it out there so if you want to go back and pull over and review it again that's fine so [Music] listen that that altar of incense on that altar on that golden offer is offered your incense of your confession the way that they would mix up that incense was was slowly taking their time just like how you offer your I think so many times we fail to take time with God to offer up that incense of our confession to him of our Thanksgiving in our praise and I are believing to him like David pray do unto me according to all that you have promised that's our that's the correct approach to God you will give no we're begging and pleading with God like you know many times my children come to me begging and pleading and saying please can I have an iPod please get a Apple iPhone please can I have this and that get them anywhere but if you can come based upon God's Word and said do unto me according to all of our promises and listen that golden altar is where you take all of your burdens that lay it upon him and I think that's a problem that problem that that we have with our broken up families and our children running around everywhere it's because we haven't we've tried to mend it up we've tried to do with ourselves but if you come to that golden altar and it all on God because he said cast all of your cares upon me take my yoke my yoke is easy my burden is light and that's what he wanted us to do it's take all of our cares all of your problems at work all of the things where people are ridiculing you all all the church problems everything maybe you want a little bit closer experience with God take it before that golden altar and lay it upon him and see God work a wonder listen sometimes I think so many times we fight our battles the wrong way in the Old Testament they fought with a sword slinging it against the Philistines they thought with a sword and with a with a sling and all of those things but our battles in the New Testament are fought on our knees because brother Branham said that a real man is a man with baggy knees why because he's come to God and faith confessing that God is who confessing the promises that God has given to us Psalm 141 verse 2 says let my prayer be set before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice and the book of Revelation also speaks about that your prayer being as incense but look it's not maybe not even so much prayer if you want to look at it that way but coming before God with confidence asking based upon his word believing that he is who he says he is and you are who he says he is and you come believing so this is how you get the new earth as you come believe in confessing confessing I believe it I believe it and you keep saying it I believe it I believe I believe who the Bible says I am I believe it the Bible says that he that hunger is thirst for righteousness shall be filled the Bible says that God is able to raise up these stones and the children of Abraham and you keep confessing confessing I believe I believe that the promises to me I believe that the promises to my children never ever have a negative confession as soon as you begin confessing negatively then that they their faith just crumbles you can receive your healing and begin negative confession and it just undermines the whole thing never have a negative confession always have a positive confession and if you say what the word says you'll always be having a positive confession and you speak positively positively believing believing and then God will come on the scene and recognize your faith and give you his face and that's Galatians chapter two the whole chapter - Galatians 2:20 this life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God the we're not justified by our works but we're justified by the faith of the Son of God that we're justified we're justified by his faith and that's what faith is on the bottom because of this statute of a perfect man but it's not our faith it's his faith when you enter into that Holy of Holies that's the difference between the Old Testament in the New Testament and the Old Testament they had a little faith for the time but in the New Testament you've got access to God's faith a God's faith will make a mountain move God's faith will fight your battles for you but around said if you ever see one of God God fight battles it's an amazing thing to behold when God comes on the scene and fights your battles and that's why if you can get your head stuck into that Holy of Holies and the veil drops behind you you'll be like somebody you don't care what the world thinks that says outside you won't care how many people tell you you can't be healed you can't tell you don't care how many people say your housing situation can't be fixed or that you'll never be able to be saved that you send away your day of grace you don't care about these things because your head is stuck in the Holy of Holies and the world is sealed out when the world is still out you've got a new nature you've got that dumb nature listen I believe that's one of the evidences of the of the new birth is when that that nature of the Dove comes and rest upon your so rest within your soul you cannot eat the things of the world without gagging you can't go back to that vomit that cesspool and eat it without gagging listen you say that's I think that's one of the things that people miss today they think I can I've got the new birth I can I can roll around in the vomit and the quagmire and the mud and filth in the world and still say I got the new birth that they say the new birth is not powerful enough the holy ghost is not powerful enough to deliver me from the things of the world when you get the nuber the face of God down on the inside of your soul it'll get I it'll make you gag it all that stuff you can't eat it just like that just like the Dove that went out of the Ark and and came back it could not rest upon all that nationís that the crow could rest upon there's a new nature in there and that that nature of that Dove is hungry after the word it's because that's all I could eat that's all I could feed on is that word and they said hey it's hungry and searching for searching for that hidden manna that now you've got access to in that holy of holies because down in that in that Ark of the Covenant was that the three things that represented the life of the believer the Aaron's rod that budded that shows that that when you've got the new birth the life of Christ will make something that's dead live you've got access to the hidden manna and you've got the incorruptible man of the incorruptible word that will never rot as long as it was in that holy of Holy's it would never rot you've got access to an unending supply of that incorruptible man of the incorruptible Word and and you can look at that the two tables of stone and look at that and say I see myself written in here because this is a revelation of Jesus Christ and I'm part of that revelation and I know I'm part of his word you've got access to that kind of faith and now your life is preaching a sermon now your life is preaching the greatest sermon that could ever be preached a life lived by the word hungry and for the word living for the word a concern for lost souls somebody that's in service to God brother Branham said but when he wants what and in the supernatural he said when he once walked in behind that holy of holies walked into the presence of God and the veil falls behind him there's a pot of manna there he can eat every day every hour of the week there is where he's living in this kind of glory were in the interlock wings of the cherubim the great pillar of fire and the Shekinah rested there and he's living under there he can't be nothing but a real genuine Christian Loree atmosphere but what is it what is the new birth faith is a revelation brother Adam said the new birth is a personal the revelation of Jesus Christ personal into you a personal revelation right how is it a personal revelation I'm going to share some of these quotes with you because I've been asked over and over I keep saying the new birth is when God puts his faith inside of you show me where brother Branham said then all right I'll show you where the Bible and brother Graham said there in Galatians chapter 2 verse 16 the Bible says knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the faith of Christ by the faith of court not by our faith you're justified by his faith and this justification is not talking about a baby form justification this justification is talking about when you are born again your soul is just it is just as just as God is just because that's God and you are justified by his faith by the face of Christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in Galatians 2:20 it says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me let's read let's read some things brother I'm said and while we are not a denomination in 1958 I will kind of skip down to the highlighted part and then when you let your faith faith run out - it's in - you begin to believe then let your subconscious go to acting then the faith of God will back it up then you'll go right on out see because your faith won't do too much your subconscious to move in the direction that your faith is moving and then God's faith moves in behind and confirms it all see but if it's your faith oh yes I got it right now that's that's you in that holy place your stumble I believe for my healing and you confessing I'm healed I'm healed I'm healed God's Word says I'm healed I'm healed I'm here but don't give up you wait for his faith to come and accept that you are believing and then he'll back it up and you say I wonder if it'll work on me yeah it won't do it right then so we want this to be a real healing service see your faith won't do too much but your faith is is for confessing and believing until he comes and backs it up let's see be not afraid of his iron 1961 he said see that's the poison breasts of Satan don't have nothing to do with him he don't believe like we do there's only one faith that's the faith of God right that's right God's faith your human faith don't go very far but God's faith in you makes you love everybody makes me love everybody that's right that's what God's faith does do you makes you have the same feeling that Jesus did because the Spirit of Christ is he let's reading the faith that was once delivered to the Saints I'm sorry brothers if I'm making y'all hop around a little bit I'll remember exactly where that was in my should be around there somewhere but he said that's the reason we can't have a revival you've got to get back to God's faith again in the Bible where men and women become born-again and regenerated by the Holy Ghost and good and into the door to the heart in 1960 brother Graham said now he said well he can't do much for you if you've got your own faith I don't want no faith I want his faith my faith is no good the face of God is what we need God's faith in us my faith is no good your faith is no good it takes Christ to come in and stand in that door of faith and be Lord Lord of your faith when you read in the Bible Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever your faith will say that's impossible but his faith will say Amen I am and that's where that's the whole journey of a believer and I'm gonna I'm gonna wrap up right there I don't want to where everybody out but so the musicians can come ahead and gun for see the whole journey of a believer you can see you can see the identification of where you are by looking at the journey of a believer through those course from the outer court to the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies and look back I wonder tonight if you could look back and remember all of the different times that you've studied in the world that you've prayed all night to get the you know going to youth meetings going to camps and different things to kind of rekindle that lamp stand to get the fire blazing up again to get all of that unbelief purged out of that holy place and then remember when you step through into the Holy of Holies and God came down and just just you entered into that rest where you know that you know nothing can ever take you away from this message when you when when his faith comes in and rest like that nothing can ever take your wave nothing could ever separate you from the love of God when he comes in to abide with you and then see then you you are able to preach the greatest sermon that could ever be preached you're able to share the life of Christ to the people that you come in contact with it work you're able to share the life of Christ to people at church and that is the kind of sermon that will convict the sinners and save the Lost amen let's stand to our feet I just want to I just want to pray everybody before we kind of close our let's just bow our heads for a moment I wonder tonight if you know you you hear about whether the real new birth E is and what that God is able to put his own faith inside of you and able to take the world completely out of you we read all of those quotes about how how even after you got the new birth what your your objective should be is to get as close to God as possible so that you can you can use you to a place to where that the life of Christ is made manifest in you just like it was in Jesus where people would come in near I wonder if tonight maybe if you all a life like that if you just lift up your hands to God and say if you could just use me in a way that that people would be convicted when they come into my presence when when people would would get around me and hear my conversation that would say there it goes a real child of God they're real it goes a real son or daughter of God if you just lift your hands up to him Lord Jesus you see ever hand lift it up to You Lord Jesus and Lord you your prophet taught us Lord Jesus that that with our old stubborn hearts with our hearts of stone we couldn't even move one hand up to you unless you come and spoke to us and moved us Lord Jesus to lift our hands up to you desiring something from you Lord Jesus and I pray O God that you'll look down and every upper lifted hand the night Lord Jesus and see the desires of our heart Lord Jesus Lord God you've given us a way back to You Lord God you've given us you were Lord Jesus and now we just asked Lord God that you'll help us to yield ourselves to you Lord more fully Lord that when we that when we leave this place tonight Lord Jesus will be more changed Lord Jesus that something will have taken place within us Lord God of desire maybe to be more concerned about the loss be more concerned about our families be more concerned about our church be more concerned about the other believers in the message Lord Jesus the Oh Lord will maybe be able to pray a little bit differently now we'll be able to read the word a little bit differently Lord Jesus and it will go forth from this from this place you change people Lord Jesus Lord God look upon our desire Lord God with i uplifted hand Lord Jesus and I pray Lord that little Lord be seen as you as a sweet incense going up before your altar in heaven Lord God we pray we asked Lord Jesus your blessings upon this church Lord Jesus since you'll just bless the remainder of this service bless the pastor Lord God and all the ones Lord Jesus that might be needed here
