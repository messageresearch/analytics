========================================

it's recording good morning good morning morning morning morning morning good morning we only have one Tech and brother Bob's upstairs and brother way doesn't laid it right there on the table no I didn't I laid it on the table in before before I start I want to I want to continue my thought that I was on last time on uh signs and prophecies at the end time it's been on the news for I don't know since last week that shooting in Connecticut they shot 20 kids and six adults and the youngest was 6 years old but uh there has been killing since uh since the beginning of time when Cain slew his brother right and there's only two Spirits in a world that's God's spirit and the devil so God put us on free moral agency uh Joshua josua said Joshua said choose you this day Who You Shall Serve but as for me and my house We Shall Serve the Lord but uh the devil is still trying to kill us but he can't unless God lets him just like job he told the devil that he consider to my servant job and he said well you got a edge around him he said well go ahead go ahead but don't touch his life but uh that doesn't mean we don't have to go through trials and and tribulations just like uh just like brother Danny what he had to go through you know so maybe we had to change his name to Jo I okay let's read our first scripture Daniel 124 but old Daniel shut up the words and sealed the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fr and knowledge shall increase last time I was talking about cars with no drivers and pilots and airplanes with no pilots on them and uh I'm have to be looking for a job because they going to have big trucks but uh when uh when we got out here I was showing um all the pictures of the airplanes and the in the cars and he said they also have uh cars that fly and uh skateboards that hover so maybe he should be here okay let's read that other scripture which is my main topic that I want to talk about uh Matthew 12 12 verse 38-41 12:38 then certain other the scribes and other the Pharisees answered saying master will see a sign from theee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seek after sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the Well's Valley shall shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and said the man in N shall rise in Judgment of this generation shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here and what was the sign that was a sign of the restoration Jesus Christ resur Resurrection in US it has to be from the inside that's so I still have to talk about signs even though we know what it is you know because like I said everybody's looking for sign right in the message uh a true sign that Overlook brother said he said how strangely that man will do that that we look for a sign when a sign right with them right among them now Israel had got into that condition and sometimes that torture that the sign has to go through is amazing the torture that Jesus went through to prove the sign of God that he was the Messiah now we fin out he this young Prophet by the name Ezekiel constantly became a sign all the time how he tort to himself one place we find that where he laid on his left side for 390 days God told him to get some beans and some pottage put it all together and cook it up and lay it down by his side and go lay on a towel and lay on his left side alone not turn over for 390 days well I couldn't do that think of it and that said turn over on that right side and lay there 40 days again and he said here what you see Ezekiel said because you're bearing the iniquity of the people each day will account a year for them being that every day he laid there that meant a year that be there'll be in captivity and that their iniquities would be remembered MH to God and God would not hear their prayers no more but the torture that that man had to go through why would that be necessary man has wonder why would such a thing be necessary for a man to do that is because that people won't read the word and they won't pray so God is Sovereign and he sends his Prophet to be a sign the people won't read they don't care to read they won't pray because they're they got other things to do they can't take time to pray and they B Bible is boresome to them hasn't got enough action for those modern days or any other day brother B says he he spends about 10 hours just for half hour to do this with I don't do it as much so little by little the Lord gives me something and then I you know but like I say I feel sorry for then they have to do say later year that coming out age that was Moses that Prophet that was God signed to Israel they had been for 100 years in bondage and God prepared a sign for them just before deliverance and he was a sign of Deliverance to Israel and a sign a judgment to Egypt now now no was a sign of Deliverance to his people and a sign of judgment to the Lost World an unbeliever the very Waters that choked the world and drown the world was the only means of saving Noah and the only thing that could save him was judgment and the only thing that will save the church today is Judgment God lay the judgment to the pl but Noah preached the same he became a sign God only sends his prophet when the people wants a prophet God sends a sign when the people are ready for a sign but the thing is that people sell them they get to a place that they don't want that they want emotion they want some show us a sign from heaven like the Pharisees sign from here you already got a sign but when God sends a sign they don't want to see it so it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed to the babes that will learn Jesus warned us the last day that what would happen but a true servant a true Prophet never fails to stay right with th said the Lord he said Moses stay with the Lord he was a sign he was a sign to Israel that their day of Deliverance was at hand and he was assigned to Egypt that the day of the end was at hand cuz they drowned out there in that Dead Sea later the whole Army of pharaoh they were at the end of their military power a prophet was a sign of a national end he said think of it how great God is and what Simplicity he works in surely if he the UN educator can understand it the educator should if the slaves the slum pits of Egypt could understand that that that was a prophet from God and the hour was at hand how much more ought the pharaoh's Palace to know it but that's a kind that doesn't know it that's a kind that misses it always and that Moses stood looking through those windows that those children Israel passing by to Israel to Pharaoh they were slaves and dogs but to Moses they were the elected of God the Bible said that Moses chose made his own choosing to suffer the reproach of Christ esteeming it Greater riches than the pleasure of sin for he had recompensed unto the reward Moses knew that at them wasn't m d there were people with a promise himself he knew who he was he he could couldn't tell them they got to recognize it themselves he knew himself what his work was to be done he knew that God had raised him up for this purpose but he couldn't tell them as long as they were blind to it he never did Ral himself openly until they'll recogniz it then they seen that sign and they knew it he said I'll give Israel a sign take this stick turn it into a snake if they won't listen to that then put your hand on your booom pull it out heal yourself of leprosy then believe it and then if they won't hear it take water of the now down there pour on the dry land all the waters will become blood that was a national sign the people will believe it when the people will believe it when them that's ready to receive it it will believe it when they see the sign of God moving but the nation has to have something different so he gave them all a sign yeah he he preached different message on on signs you know like uh signs and prophecies Junction of time Junction of time and so I guess maybe that's why he's called the end time Messenger to give us a sign that's right absolutely that's it that's right Elijah was a signed in his day the Prophet Elijah to the to the he was a sign of God's word judgment to Egypt and deliverance to Israel if they wanted to believe him in that sinful day of Elijah when is all Israel went back to went back on God they gone back to sin they forgot the order they forgot about being led out by God and the great Jehovah they opened the Red Sea and brought them out of uh out of Egypt and how that Elijah stood there both thus said the Lord oh God give us a man like that he wasn't afraid to tell Jezebel about her condition he wasn't scared of Ahab he wasn't afraid that he was mistaken he stood with boldness and walked up to Ahab and said not even do will fall till I call for it what was he a signed to that sinful generation Israel did Israel see it no they laughed at him make fun of him he predicted there will be a rought that would be there there would be trouble hunger starvation and he prophesied boldly standing by himself was thus said the Lord they kill they kill all the true of them they killed them all I'm the only ones left that's standing with your word what was the trouble about the word of God Elijah wanted to stay with the word he was a real Prophet other prophets had said oh well it doesn't make much difference Jehovah doesn't care you know Jehovah does care it's got to be his word Elijah stood boldly on that word with thou said the Lord God have him God gave him a secret one day he said I got seven I got 7,000 L that you witness to out there they haven't got that nerve enough to come up and claim it they're hiding around the bushes but yet in their heart they're my servants they they have a need to bail they're afraid to do it but I'm giving you a sign and you're a sign he say stand out there on my word I'll take care of you give them a sign Allelujah God sends us something like that who will be a sign of God's word and every promise god promise will be backed up in that person CU he's a sign a forgotten sign and the mess the junction of time he talks about dispensations and Junctions and corners and but you probably same thing he said always in the days gone by the dispensations has always come to their end and he said we hit a junction there's Junctions on the highway there's Junctions on the roads that we travel on this world there's Junction on this Grand Old Highway that we travel to Glory he said in my searching for the scriptures for quite a while I have found seven Great Junctions in God's word and seven is God's complete number we he completes in seven he worked six days and the Seven rested the world EX exist and his Reign Over the Earth here the church labors for 6,000 years and the Seven is the Millennium and all this mathematics of the Bible are perfect and we are believing that with all this great turmoil that we're living in today as we let look around on every hand and pick up the newspapers and just stand still and drop our everyday hustle and bustle of this neurotic age and look out and face fact we see Beyond in a shadow of a doubt that something just about to happen I'm kind of leaning on to getting on the Rapture maybe next week but uh I'm kind of you know like when we take a trip we have to get ready here before get we can't get up there with brother B we get ready here so so maybe next week talk about that the junction God always before this great Junction comes or ending of time where he starts something new Junctions with the old or to the new with one dispensation to another he always shows forth as Power Man Through the Ages always breaks down and teaches away and explain PLS away and gets away from the real living God but just before he Junctions enters a new dispensation he appears on the scene with great miracles signs and wonders he has always done it he said look at the first destruction of the world the first Junction after the world was formed and God placed man on Earth that the Bible said they began to build cities Great buildings programs went on in the world look at it today Jesus plainly said as he was in the day no no so shall be in the coming of the son of man he said and now notice again that not only that when all hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose also when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up standard against it and these two forces always show at the junction any comments where what m no go ahead huh go ahead okay and know is back there in that evil day just before the destruction when God had a man out preaching the gospel a poor man humble man not very much of the world but a man who had a heart to listen to God no now at the same time there was a Noah and Enoch preaching at the same time mhm he said how the day we live in a Junction Road at the end of the road the End of the Age God has proven it what a marvelous day to believe in oh God why can't Christians see blessed are they pure in heart they shall see God less are the meek they shall inherit the earth The Junction time is at and our father to to show that we're at the end time see the Miracles the supernatural the omnipotent doing the Miracles look at him events made clear about prophecy said now every time that the church gets mixed up in God for knew they would for he knew all things therefore has his certain Prophet ready for the age to cause is the leting by his Vindicated word of signs and wonders and confirming of his word confirming the word with signs following as he promised he gives the true interpretation after the prophet himself has been Vindicated all but those the elected to whom he is sent hate him now exam every instant and and see if that's right or not only the ones that he is sent to he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as he did receive to them gave him power to become sons of God notice every examination of the word in every instant and at the end of every age or climate or Junction I preached on it many times look at the age of Noah at the climax before judgment what happened Noah it was only his family they believe that men the rest of them criticized him and destroy the whole world in the days of Abraham only Abraham's group they believe when the angels went and preached to sod only lot and his wife and two daughters came out and she turned back to a pillar of salt uh we're at the letter of CH we had a prophet we had an end time message and last name we got a judgment if we we say we got oil in our lamps it's time to trim them get out of here m M I like that song the good old gospel ship it says I'm going to take a trip in the good old gospel ship I'm going far beyond the sky I'm going to shout and sing until the heavens ring when I'm bidding this world goodbye but before we do that like I said we have to get ready that's right everybody thinks of something that we need like when when you take a trip we have to pack a bag right so what are we going to what do we need to get ready here put in the bag before we get out of here and uh I was thinking of that statue of the perfect man next week is going to be a class participation so you all think of something I don't want to give you all the answers that's it leave it for them huh leave it for next week don't tell us this week yeah I'm not going to tell you before we go I want to thank everybody for the Christmas gifts that you gave we weren't here but or I wasn't here I appreciate and listen um starting the first week in January I'll be doing the class again I've got three things I'm thinking about but I want you to write down on a piece of paper and give them to uh me of what you would want me to do starting in January but I got about three ways to
