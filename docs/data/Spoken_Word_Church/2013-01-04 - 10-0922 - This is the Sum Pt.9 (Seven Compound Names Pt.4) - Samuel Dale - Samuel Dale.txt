so we'll we'll announce it Sunday whether or not brother uh the brother be with us Wednesday so Heavenly Father we thank you for the day and thank you for the time thank you most of all for salvation thank you for all of the Redemptive names that you've revealed unto us and our revealing and that you're making yourself manifest we see each and and every one of them and all of them are here tonight Lord we just thank you we ask you to just have your way in the service and speak to our hearts and our lives that Lord we may be able to say what you would have to be said you know our thoughts and how they are and Lord just waiting on you to speak on these things that we are talking about we ask you to just let your love shine with each and every one of us you said in your word that you sent your word in he heal us so we believe you and we just thank you for it and thank you for the rain Lord that we're going to get in the things cuz we have a need just have your way with us now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness lead us in jesus' name amen Hebrews 8:1 we read this in enough now the things which we have spoken this is the PSAL we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens after all Paul summing up seven chapters then he said that statement is wonderful isn't he Ecclesiastes the preacher when he begins to finish and conclude his message he says verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the matter what is the conclusion of the matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole Duty uhen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing now if I don't get down to this uh on the U Psalms 23 uh just keep that please and bring it back Sunday because we want to try to uh you know to get on to to using that maybe one right together of you know sometime when we get down to doing it and now you know what I've been trying to do is speak to you about the uh seven compound names of Jehovah now in doing that I I appreciate you coming along and helping me and and everything and and you know and it shows that you're you're listening and you know things and bringing back to me uh helps and things that you know uh I need it but uh the word compound sister Trudy is talking to her the other day about it see the word compound is it's a word that means like you mix something it's actually a mixing of things uh it's only found one time in the the scriptures and it's found in let's see where it is Exodus Exodus 30 and 25 but what it's talking about D is a compounding or mixing together of the ointments and you know they had people specifically set aside to mix those things together but now what I'm trying to get you to see about compound is is that uh once you mix something there is no way to separate that right now you take white plant paint you mix it with black paint you going to have gray or something and there's no way for you to ever be able to uh make that either white you can add all the white you want to to it but it'll still have the black tinge to it you can add all the black you want to it but it's still going to have a certain amount all right but now in God what has been our Point our point is that you can't have one of the seven compound names and I know there's more than than just what we're giving you because there they're they're in the scriptures but they're all contained in the seven compound names and uh but you can't separate them remember what the prophet said he said you can't separate them right I gave you a bunch of quotes are kind of in the beginning of what we were talking on he said there's there's no way to separate those names you can't make one greater than the other right righten it it's it's brother ROM I gave you where he said it's the attributes of God he said it was even the attitude of God he said it was his nature right all how can you separate it and see that's what I believe are are what we're doing and it doesn't matter to me to keep saying it over and over and over and over if you get upset at it just lay out next time I preach you might have to listen to that service you can get it after then but now listen once they're put together how can they be separated right amen and how can they not be put together when brother R said you can't separate those names from Jesus Christ right cuz he is those names that is him revealing himself down through the Old Testament you know and using the titles that we're using are coming out of the Old Testament scriptures and it's showing that if he's the same yesterday today and forever all right then how can you make one thing greater than the other right all right we've been dealing with Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided sacrifice you know all right now we look at that and we're quick to re recognize him as our sacrifice and we would not D tell anybody that we're not saved right right but now when you come to Jehovah rapi the Lord that Health all of thy diseases well yeah he can heal some things and yeah he can do this or yeah he can do that but we don't put it on the same level as our Salvation now listen I know what your mind capability is you'll automatically run with the fact that well the the stripes the stripes that healing is not Eternal but one day it will be amen that's right all right now is he going to die again to do that no you agree that one day it'll be Eternal right you agree that one day these bodies will be Eternal I believe that all right now if not you better be hoping you can get you new and or do something and if you even get a new one it would have to be Eternal that's right but see that's the point I'm trying to make we put the emphasis upon our Salvation real firm yes I'm saved well is any way now that that I could convince you that you wouldn't say no no I'm saved all right there's any way that I convince you that you're not healed right that don't take much convincing when you're looking at the circumstances right and don't take a lot of convincing so we're not putting our healing on the same basis as the salvation and remember what I was trying to bring out you can say Well it it was beaten but if he hadn't went to Calvary and died and gave his life that beating of his back would not have healed you amen do you understand amen it would have not have healed you had he not died on Calvary because the healing is in the blood it's the life of the blood it's not the compound you can hold m is faith in the blood that was shed for you and I and doing that the life had to go out amen all right now we what I'm trying to do is me and you I'm say me first is to get to the bases that we can put you know and not look at our things like these two bottles of olive oil and those on tape one of them is pretty good size and the other one's small well see then we say well now now now now now brother this is my healing this is my salvation oh my that's right no all right then maybe we pick up another bottle and set it up and it's smaller than the other two I guess that's Jehovah Banner or something you know maybe that's Jehovah tiin you or or righteousness but see how can that be that's not true your Prophet said if he is Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided sacrifice then he must be Jehovah rapi your healer am all right now when we get that on the same level you're going to see a change of the body am right amen I believe that all right now because our salvations are said we won't dare say we're not saved well now now now brother Dale I've Got My Confession now listen to what I'm saying I go to so get get offended at me but I'm right trying what I'm trying to say I'm trying to show you exactly where you and I both are standing we say My Confession and my healing is great I agree with you you got to take but then we go to the doctor right now listen do we go anywhere you remember Sunday now do we go anywhere to try to get something about our Salvation right we put it there don't ride on my Tombstone right on there I died in faith MH but do we put it on the same level that's why we're not getting healed now you understand what I'm saying me I need healing just like you need healing right I'm not talking about you I know how people in their little petty feelings gets offended and I'm not going to apologize for what I said about the the restroom business that you know everybody running in there for the kidney problem I'm not going to apologize cuz I said what I meant and meant what I said and I said it right right now I'm not talking about you that's got a problem now if you got offended at me on that you better talk to God because I was right I was telling you exactly and I said it if you got a problem you go to the bathroom but your problem is when you let your kidneys and your things or anything else hinder you from listening to the word of God right amen you let your kids you let your things happen and you let it hinder you right so you get offended at me because I say something about the bathroom well I'm not saying anything about anybody's got a kidney problem the only thing I've said about it and I still believe it we pray for the sick right you know but now you got kid problems and won't come up and let us pray for you you know what I know it you'll keep your kidney problems right amen now that's as honest as I can be now the Lord showed me that the other day and if I'm wrong you come tell me and show me where I'm wrong but if you keep your problems and you confess your problems wrong you keep your problems that's right you can't say by Stripes I'm Healed and then in the next turn turn around and SA but uh you don't understand my problem but you see I know people gets offended at me for what I say I'm sorry I don't want the education to be able to smoothe it over I just say it like it is and I offend you I'm sorry but if you take that what I say to you and you say it right is you like I said the other day you know people tell me said Brother D I can't sleep in the middle of the day cuz if I sleep in the middle of the day I can't sleep at night well evidently Sunday night and Wednesday night none of you sleep that's mean but is it the truth you can sleep in church it don't hurt you but if you lay down on the couch at home and take a out you see what I'm saying I try to say something in the nicest way I can but I just don't have a nice way of saying it I'm sorry but now listen can we put everything on the same level that's we'll keep repeating this cuz you notice I hadn't tried to go into one to the other on it I'm just trying to pick it up as I go but what I want you to understand tonight is one thing if God ever was he still is amen and whatever he was he still is or else he changed somewhere right now if he changed I won't know where he's at because according to my Bible Malachi 3 I think he said I'm godten I change not that's right am now but I want to nail something hard tonight on one thing cuz I intended to preach this message last and I'm sure I won't forget it and do it but I want you to go over to Exodus with me thank you Exodus 48 wait a minute get it can't be 48 let's go to 33 I put a got so many notes written on top of notes you want to see it cuz I'm using the same notes to do all these sermons from and that's hard to do so I write right over the top of it I preached on this but look at it in uh Exodus 33 and4 now let's go back up to let me let me give you the story and then we'll start reading about the 12th verse this is where Moses actually verse 11 was talking to God face to face that's what it says right there as a man speaketh unto his friend that's how the Lord spake to Moses now that's something in it that the Lord spake to Moses face to face all right but look at verse 12 he's talking about bringing up the people sayest unto me bring up this people and th thou Hast not let me know whom thou Wilt send with me yet thou Hast said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way right listen that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee right and I will give thee rest you remember what I've always tried to get you to see about Moses he spoke God spoke to God face to face but he wanted to see him one day they wanted to see him Verse 18 show me thy Glory he wanted to see him right in the middle the Lord said my president shall be shall go with thee now that's Jehovah sha right that the Lord's presence are the Lord is here now what about all of the things of Moses I'm trying to get a background and then just say a few words what about all of the things of Moses like at the burning bush Exodus 3 and14 when he was standing there talking to the Lord and the Lord said I am that I am y right what about all of the things and the times that God spoke to Moses he was a human being mortal and he wanted to see God but all of that time God was trying to get Moses to see that he was with him right that's why we took this 14th verse right out of the middle of it see go on down reading and you'll find where he's trying to uh want to see God right right in between there God says I'm present Jehovah shma I'm present with you now I thought we believe the scripture you know that where Jesus said I'll be with thee always always but yet sure as human Mortals we want to see God right we want to see things happen we want to see healing or something and then we'll say well God is with us but to me God was trying to tell Moses said Moses I've been with you you've destroyed the Egyptians you've destroyed a nation that's your word said you know that wasn't you was see one there's nothing wrong with wanting to see more more of God now get to me right Moses wanted to see God more real than he had seen and there's not anything wrong with that all of us do and we will but if we don't recognize he's with us amen like I'm tried to tell you a god up in heaven no I want a god present with me amen I want him with me I don't want it to be that I've got to wait for him to come down so get the point what I'm saying now Moses wanted to see God after God had said this is my presence here with you I've been with your mouth I've destroyed a nation I wipe out all of your enemies I'll take you through right that's what I'm saying now get it right please I want to see more of God don't you right and you know what when we walk off this Earth I still want to see more of God right so get me right now but if we don't recognize what we have right the basis of Moses that's what God was telling him the only way now Moses that I can become visible to your eyesight it's for you to remember the things where I've been present with you right well I'm brother tell you just don't understand sometimes I feel him sometimes I don't what's that got to do with right amen you making God a liar God said I'm with you amen amen right who was it uh was it joob who would it said who would they said if I make my bed in hell right AR with me but you see we keep looking out somewhere else now I tried to explic it we say salvation we will dare not never confess anything wrong in our salvation but yet in their healings we won't put that on the same basis now Moses was a mortal he wanted to do it and I do too I want to see God move on the scene in every heart and lives in in you more than I want to see him in myself that's always been my desire that's what tore me up when the the brother said at the pillar of fire was up here at the pull pit and then he said went down through the aisle this brother said the Lord's leaving us I sat right here and said no way he's not leaving us he's doing exactly what I asked him to do was leave up from here and get off of it being on me and get with you and let you see God am and let you call for rain and you call for the things I want to see God in your life brother I want to see you in myself okay you're selfish I'm sorry that's right I want to see him in your life amen and I love to hear your testimonies amen of telling me what God has done brother Marlo the other day he'd been having trouble he'd been sick he looked over at Danny and saw Danny raising his hands you know what he done he entered a law of Faith you know what God healed him bless him that's what I want to see I want to see God in your life I want you to tell me about about the the god that you serve I love for you to tell me those things and I say well it's working it's working amen you know what I'm saying is the truth in this message 99% of the preachers wants all of the glory put behind the pull pit and what they're doing and what they're happening brother told me he said brother there you're wrong said press on and your own I said I'm pressing on for the people that's right Lord I want to see God in your life then when I see God in your life I know I preach the truth right amen God it's manifested in your life amen but if we don't believe he's present well now in a way see now you can take a the great discourse of the message I can just hear it I can hear the computers clicking as there say I'll get him on this one cuz he don't understand that God was Alpha and nothing in between and then he's Omega I don't believe that you don't believe what brother R said no I don't believe you understand what brother R said cuz he's the one that went on and said said everything in between and if he Hebrews 138 I just ran a few you look at them where brother R was talking about the presence of God he said and that's always been here but do we believe it one of these days it's coming all right now one of these days is coming one of these days I'm going get my healing but I'll have you to know I'm saved you don't say one of these days you're going to be saved right right right right you say you're saved you're not looking out there remember the compound of it if he ever is Jehovah he had to be that before the world if he ever is Jehovah rapi that's right he had to be that before the world that's right and where would there be one attribute larger than the other it's Father Son and Holy Ghost the three attributes of God is one greater than the other now they're all three one right cuz there not three it's not three separate identities or persons it's three manifestations of the same God now was he any less God when he was Jehovah in the Old Testament than he was when he was walking the shores of galile come on is he any less God in the baptism of the Holy Ghost than he was when he walked here brother R said he's here tonight just like he was on the day of Pentecost right said he's here like he was when he walked the shores of Galilee right but do we believe that that's right well I don't know brother so and so says it's this way well all right let's get out of where brother so and so's at right right you know yep no problems the problems is staying here and keeping the doctrines here but you understand that is he Jehovah shamama which means his presence are the Lord is present let's see I can't figure that now where I picked that n from oh okay I got it now I'm looking down to reading my own note from let's go to Ezekiel 48 I knew that 48 had to be in there right okay Ezekiel 48:35 he's measuring out all of the things of the Ruben the G and the sides and the the buildings and the things and all and then watch what he says it was around about 18,000 measures in the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is here huh now that is the promise of the millennium amen all right y That's page 5 55 through 5 let's see 551 through 554 the seal book brother Ram is explaining about the children of Israel and how that it will come into a millennial Reign and the name of that City then will be the Lord is there Jehovah shamama the Lord is present all right but now are we going to wait until the Millennium to recognize he's with us now explain to me how you can have the new birth and that new birth not be his presence pre now explain that one okay how can you have a new birth and that not be his presence right amen what did you get well I shouted spoke the tongu I CRI well here you go see but Moses after speaking with God face to face right amen I than mistaken I believe I'm quoting it correctly I believe brother R use lip to ear or mouth to mouth one of the two is huge but irregardless of all of the things that God had done Moses was human enough to want to see more and I do too amen why would you read the word of God why would you study the message if you didn't want to see or I mean my goodness folks but listen the only way that he can save you now now listen to what I'm saying the only way anybody could ever be saved was the fact that God had to come to Earth and die right amen now you agree with that right you God had to come and die there's no salvation you say well these Jews will come in 145 days will come in they'll only come in because of Calvary right the Bible said he died once for all that's right there's not a Salvation for somebody besides any of the groups that's died but how can you separate salvation from his presence sure you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know that in the book of Acts they had many feelings of the Holy Spirit but they only had one birth but they had many feelings right right there's many feelings right but only one birth sure we preached it and everything else that God is going to become present with us and raise the dead and we go in Rapture but you haven't heard me preaching it like most everybody else preaches it you go back and check what I tried to preach to you about what five or 6 months ago when I was talking about how that brother randam up until 62 long to L of 62 he was still looking for something to come but when he entered that with opening of the seal he never looked back no more amen he never looked forward either he was looking at what was standing right there because God was present with him what did Brother rold say even back before then listen where's it at um every prison when it turns you I'm trying to find it yeah look at the last one seven compound names with Jehovah in the bottom of the page preaching 5510 and look what he said the last one of his Redemptive names it appeared to Abraham he said I am Jehovah rapi the provided one to provide a sacrifice provide the way what is it God will provide it and I am Jehovah that Health Thee I am thy righteousness I am thy peace I am thy Shield I am thy banner and I'm ever present to perform it amen you see what I mean ever present to perform it Jehovah means like a father with his family that was what it was derived from back there in the Old Testament that's why it's not used in Genesis 1 because he's still self-existing but in Genesis 2 it's used lord god Jehovah Elohim God came down to reveal himself to be present and show me where he ever went back up right but do we believe he's here or not right no brother Dale he's coming well then all that series I preached on the second coming is blowned out of your mind and you slept through it or done something through it right you didn't understand all I was trying to explain because he started his second coming on the day of Pentecost there's things in this day will finish in the second coming mean yes but it'll be no different God he was ever present with every believer he was their healer he was their savior he was their Banner he was their peace he was their Shepherd amen and he was ever present you know what's the reason now get on to this so take us six months on this probably cuz like I said we don't believe him to be the same as Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah RI we want Jehovah Gyra to be something big Jehovah RI to be something small and then up and down and we just zigzag it and trying to find some kind of a something to satisfy our own ego but if we don't believe him to be je Jehovah shama then how can you ever be saved right that's right amen you can't be folks that's a mental concept right that's all you got is a mental concept of salvation you don't have a personal experience of Jesus Christ amen you don't have eternal life within your soul by the new birth you have a mental concept that youve trying to confess yourself into it amen you're trying to work it up yep but he said I'm ever present to perform now do you think that Martin Luther I use that because the ages and the way one of people preaching on oh they got him in Alpha and Omega you don't think he was present with Martin Luther and adj you live by faith now he's not present like he is now I got the quote from the prophet now did did Luther house a new birth amen now if you had the new birth and you have the new birth what's the difference in your new birth and his new birth right that's why there was 120 in the upper room that received that new birth at one position but everybody else has had to come as a baby and a baby is a baby so what you're saying is down in the age of Martin Luther what did the baby look like man I don't know didn't look like a baby what it look like it was a baby the new birth in Luther's age was a new birth which was the birth of the world word amen look at to the top one second coming 1955 220 days to me it's every word inspired now this is 55 see and it's only foundation for the Christian I believe it's God's word words you you see what he's saying the only foundation God's word and I know what but it's true today it's perfect as I'm standing here and it's God's infallible Eternal everpresent Word and frankly it's God himself living Amen in word form isn't that wonderful think of it people God himself in word form go down to the next one while we at it 1959 611 which is time of decision look we're glad that we have the Living Word now listen to the prophet and the written word now is any difference in the living word and the written word now you better read the next part of the sentence before you make up your mind right and they by record one with the other the only difference is one of them is a live word and the other one is God in letter form right right still pretty good that lets that makes us rest assured that when we read this blessed Bible that it's a challenge to us and we know the one who wrote it is present ever present to make every word true and right said to sink that deeply into your heart The Living Word and the written word is God you see if God was ever anything he has to always be there that's right now it might be that we can't make him manifest his that that don't change God does it there was things down to Luther's age and all like that but you better remember one thing see we think oh this is this and this is that and they didn't have this that and the other you better check on the life of Martin Luther where he had all of the gifts right and he spoke in tongues and things like that you better begin to read a little you better go back and check on some of those people right but do you believe him to be Jehovah shamama amen the Lord is present am now if you don't believe him to be here present then you don't have the new birth right could I make that any blunder when I brother Dale he was in brother Brown bless him and if if he come back brother R said this gift and things in my life will not heal you right abely amen was that what he said he said it only brings the acknowledgement or the recognition into you as a seeing that God is here when you don't believe he's here all right see I thought i' went to the LI to preach on this but I saw it there the other day and I said no I'm going to change that and I'm going to preach that in the next message because that's the key to the whole thing amen if he's Jehovah shama then he's present right that is the only way he can be Jehovah Gyra right right the only way he be Jehovah Gyra is the fact that he is just as equal are of the same value as Jehovah shamama and Jehovah J is the same amen Jehovah RI is the same but you see in our mental capacity of our mind we're the ones that's cutting God off now brother around let's see if I can remember he said said he's God and you don't change he said no I didn't say we didn't change right he said he don't change Moses look at the things that has happened don't you remember the burning bush don't you remember me sending you to Egypt didn't I tell you that I'd be with you did not Jesus come up and say I am that I am am you said no he didn't say that that was in ex I'm glad you're thinking cuz see Jesus said before Abraham was I am before Moses was before the burning bush I am right I am was the one that spoke to Moses from the burning bush right amen that was Jesus in that burning bush not as the human element come on but as the Christ amen I am I am means what ever present for eternity that's your prophet's definition ever present for eternity in other words if he ever change anywhere that's right anywhere coming down true if ever changed he's not the same right but if he hadn't changed he's always present amen can't we put then Jehovah shama his presence and see that he's here to give us the new birth and that new birth is his presence he said but Brother D I look like you don't believe in the second coming I preached it for months I preached it for months anybody out there you go back and listen it's on there and call a second coming and I believe as I said while ago that on the day of Pentecost he began his second coming that's right amen sir and it'll finish in this end time bride with a change of these bodies it'll prove that he was here but it'll prove what was not let me see if I can quote it my memory this message was to prove now this is probably paraphrase but this message was to prove that Paul and him was right right you agree right this message is to prove that Paul and him was right but was it proven Paul to be right are proving that the Lord is right you see but you know what we have our troubles with Genesis 3 and8 you don't have to turn to these I just reading talking about Adam and Eve and they heard the voice of God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees you know what was the trouble with Cain Genesis 4:16 and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord Satan's problem Job 1 and2 so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord he's going down to to get on to job remember job 2 and 7 it says so Satan so went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord and smoked job with sore balls on the sole of his foot unto his crown and you think he could have ever stood in the presence of God and been able to done that no no right what are we to do acts 3:9 repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord not from Up down to hear that's our problem really it's what is that saying repent therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come when we realize his presence is here right 1 chonicles 16 and 27 Glory and Honor are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place what you need glory honor presence strength gladness Psalms 16 and11 thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more but do we realize he's present now here is man's concept so let's see if it fits here anywhere I believe that the devil taught a trinity yeah I know that he laughed at us and taught three Gods him believing in one himself but you know what I believed he wanted to plan into our minds and has done a good job that God is off somewhere else somewhere or other place or some something and that he's not here I believe that's the devil's tactic that's right to try to get us to think God is not here you know why Cain couldn't stay in the presence of God in sin right right so he went out from the presence right now to me to you to all of us would we do like we do if we knew that we turned around and looked at Jesus right come on am oh we're all pretty good so you know like I said you know we we we have you know trou but then you know oh you know I I do something wrong to brother collie and I feel real bad but if I don't go get that straight in the hurry it won't be long of you blaming brother collie for the whole time right now you tell me that don't work I'm sorry I'm too old cuz that's the way he works upon my mind as well as your mind you make you justify yourself but how could me and brother collie be having any trouble if we believe Jesus was in each other if he believ Jesus in me and I believe Jesus in him how can we have any trouble come on what what can you do no matter what anybody does to you how can you justify wrong of doing anything back to him it's like pH told me one time and said yeah but it feels good to get rid of that just get rid of that energy build up and just bust somebody I me a brother told me that well I get some makes you feel good like them guys at work used to they'd hit their hand or do something and they'd let out these big old long words four letters you know tell them did that have anyen well it V my energy I said yeah if You' have said Thank You Lord I didn't break it oh Lord you see we want to vend our anger why because we don't believe he's present right is that true that's right do we look at our brothers and sisters as seeing Christ come on preach butd it's pretty hard sometimes I argue with you about it I agree with you amen you don't see a preacher get up here and light with me listen don't I'm human I have my problems just like you have your problems you don't hear me going around holler out how good he two shoes I am no I'm a sinner saved by grace right and must repent every day and keep myself straight cry out to God help me Lord but you know what like I've always tried to tell you you read it and see if I'm right the children of Israel when time they left Egypt until they reached cadis barnea I believe they had sinned 10 times sure they lost a few thousand people because of the problem they got into but God never did tell him he wasn't going to take them to the promised land right but when they got to Cades Baria and would not believe Josh UA and Caleb report of the land and that they were well able to take it they sinned a sin that God would not override and he said to the Wilderness you go and you'll die there and remember you better consider a lot of things we don't take it like we take it lightly Jesus when they said to him our fathers ate Mana in the Wilderness you know what Jesus said and there everyone dead now your Prophet said that meant they were eternally separated yeah but no no little bit all you want to and they going to change God's word they going to change God's word you think God don't know a little Israelite to grow up to be a big Israelite and don't you think he'd know what he's going to do when he gets old enough come on but do you believe that God is present listen folks if it's not but for one thing I have to believe it all right not just because I saying I have to but the word that God has allowed to be preached in this little place am if you can't see that that is the presence of the Lord then Heaven Help your blindness right right it surely ain't been a man cuz this old man standing here that's preached to you is the first one to admit that's got problems you said but brother Dale you mean you got Pro yes I got problems I'm human you know I'm human human means going to have problems but see I I still like to stay in this scriptures you think Moses didn't get upset at the children of Israel you better remember he went up to get the Commandments and he come back down and found what they was doing and you know what he done he busted them Ten Commandments and but he was ready to start ripping throats right but the same man turned around one day and said Lord if you take them you got to come over me right cuz I'll Stand far you see we're all human right but let's let's don't let our human parts override understanding of God's word to recognize something if I could see healings and signs and wonders I would believe the word now you show me that in the Bible I want it in the Bible and I want it in brother R's message no people believe that you don't have to see before you can believe you going to have to believe before you can see right amen that's all I've been trying to tell you we put Jehovah Gyra as a great pedestal of salvation but we put Jehovah rapi on a smaller pedestal to say well at times he heals me when he wants to now there's no such thing in the Bible for God to heal you when he wants to right I want scripture right because he said I am the Lord that Health right already he's not going to get up on the cross or be beat again to to make a pass for us to be able to get through and then to sum it up in whatever been trying to say tonight Jehovah shama he's present not coming he's here your Prophet up until 62 was preaching about the coming of the Lord but you get in the message after 62 and see what he's saying he's talking about him being here he seen it and said a lot about it back in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s so but you know why he could do it that's why that you know that there's a Doctrine among the people of the message that that brother Brandon was so wrong and messed up and then the son of man come along in the seals and straighten them out well now the seals would have never broke right because he was standing there with a foundation is the only way they could be broke to him the foundation of what he preached that's why he said beyond a curtain of time well they have to be judged he said yes said will Paul and them have to be judged said yes they'll have to be judged for what to preach said will Paul's group make it yeah he said then my well too cuz I preached just what he preached right if he had to preach what Paul preached in the seals wouldn't have broke right but see we want to look at something like that the seals brought a presence come on folks I'm right I'm telling you that's right but don't get so tied up in it until you think there's nothing until that gets here that's the problem is you you're saying there's nothing here till the 63 and then it got here right how come your Prophet said in probably 50 something he said the raptures overdue right you know why CU we wouldn't ready you know why we're here 40 something years later because we've never realized that Jehovah javra and Jehovah RFA has to be be the same level of almighty God Amen cuz you can't put it in a different level you can't make one name greater than the other cuz how would it come out to be the name Jesus do you understand he's present he's here he's he in the new birth he's never left us that's right well brother brother said the Holy Ghost said go out on the limb now going out on the limb does that mean you're lost no now come on see you think you can quote but just remember you ain't going to get by the Holy Ghost going out on the limb doesn't mean you're lost and he's left your soul that means you have wh you have yielded yourself to the devil and shut off the candles and and the things is clogged up to where God can't get back to you that's right it's not God's fault he's never left anybody because they done wrong he leaves you when you will not repent that's why he leaves come on Brothers take on these things how can you have salvation if he's not the same God of Jehovah shama what are you thinking about so I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever but I believe we're the problem that's our trouble but you see God's going to have a people and they're going to realize realization and the Rapture is going to come cuz he said it would he didn't bring the children of Israel out of Egypt because they were a good group of people right right he brought them out cuz he said he would he's here today because he said he would you ever believe it like that right I hope it just one more thing I told you about years ago when I would be talking to brother mol and I wasn't even saved at that time I wasn't born again I'd be talking to brother Mo come in and I'd be walking up my driveway and I would feel a presence with me that was so great until I would actually stop and look around to try to find the presence or you can believe that if you want to whatever you want to do but I'd look around and I'd try to find him he has a pure to me and I've seen him but you know none of that is based on my salvation that's right my salvation is a personal relationship with Jesus Christ of the person of Jesus Christ the revealed word Made Alive in my heart that is his presence but you see with the things that God has shown me and done like that even back there most people would count all that salvation I don't but you see I know what salvation is salvation is the person of Jesus Christ coming to live in you right so Brother D I've never seen it like that within pray about let's stand what we got 69 number 69 anybody have a e open my eyes that I may see glimpes of Truth thou for me my hands a wonderful key that shall unas and sh be free silent me down I wait for ready my God I will to sing open

meach me I this wish everybody could have been there Saturday with us at the fellowship meeting to hear the brother testify of what took place brother Young Blood he's a some kind of a engineer or something with power company I never didn't know for sure but they were redoing a big old train Transformer thing or working on something he said he reached down and he pulled a lever you know to cut it off so when he did it Ark see that was normal you know PR to Arc and so they done their work and everything they got ready to get everything to go and said this thing was built in the 30s I think he said now it seem like he's 30 years old or something because it was something about it a long it was old anyway and uh he said when he got ready to turn it back on said he was right there and the wall was right behind him and said he just simply said God don't let this thing explode cuz you know when they turn back on you can do it and he said he reached down and pulled a lever and said nothing didn't happen he said there was no Ark there was no sign or nothing the they spoke about it him two or three other guys walked out of the room they got out of the room just a little piece was standing there talking about you know what went wrong with it or whatever and the thing exploded you see he didn't have time to stop and pray that's right didn't think about it God has to be with us how many things as he took care of us on the way in life and all it could have been disastrous but you see I believe he's here amen Lord Jesus we've tried to deliver what's on our heart we pray that you would just bless God help us to go on our way home thinking about these things Lord that how can it be any difference in any other the compound Redemptive names how can we do as a prophet said we can't separate them but they all must be together as one Lord It's revealing your nature your character your attributes your ways we love you have your way be with everybody on the way home take care of everybody give a safe journey and just bless and guide each one now in Jesus name amen pray one for another you're dismissed
