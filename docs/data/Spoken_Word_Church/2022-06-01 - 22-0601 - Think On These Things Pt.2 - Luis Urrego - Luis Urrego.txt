evening hope you have had a good week so far we love you all with the love of the lord and uh we just appreciate each and every one of you amen um we're going to go ahead and read the word this evening and so let's turn to philippians chapter four starting at verse four we want to continue on a little topic that we started last time called think on these things part two this will be part two of and um you know the more that i think on these things the more i realize how important it is because your your your thoughts amen um mold your actions yes your thinking molds the things you say amen and your the things you say mold other people as well it helps shape other people too so so the lord tells us you know let this mind of christ be in you amen and so it has to do with the mind it has to do with the mental has to do with with with with with your thoughts amen and even think about it even the world couldn't be here without it first being thought of first it had to be a thought and so if we're part of god amen and the holy spirit who is a thinker amen and whatever thought came to him amen whatever thought comes to god it's an eternal thought therefore when we read the word of god these are eternal words and when you think these things and you're constantly repeating these things and you're looking at these things amen and you're receiving those words amen they're creating life in you amen and you become part of that eternal because you're feeding on the eternal thoughts of god amen praise the lord jesus so let's read this philippians chapter four starting at verse four rejoice in the lord alway amen it doesn't say sometimes it says alway always rejoice in the lord well my bill is too high this month for electricity oh rejoice in the lord alway well gas price is uh my gas price bill my gas bill is last month it was the highest ever rejoice in the lord alway amen and and look what paul says and again and again i say rejoice oh you don't know what i'm going through brother luisa you just i'm going through something i don't understand yeah but god understands and he was the one who wrote this word and he just he told us rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice remember when jesus said barely verily this is paul's verily verily he says it twice in the same sentence let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing in other words don't worry about anything but in everything by prayer in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and watch what happens when you do these things and the peace of god which passes all of your own understanding all of the understanding of the world all of the understanding natural understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through who through christ jesus and christ jesus is who the word right finally brethren paul says whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you amen so let's just borrow our heads this evening our heavenly father as we come before you once again we've opened back the pages of your word lord we've studied we've we've read we've done what we could lord humanly speaking father but now lord god it takes your holy spirit lord god to pull these words from the from from the book lord god and make him life to us lord jesus father god we ask for revelation lord god and lord jesus open back father god those things that we don't understand the things that my cloud father god are our our thinking lord god our process our thinking on you lord god just let us lay aside for just a little while lord god and let us concentrate on you lord jesus for you're the one that we desire lord and desire father god everything else might get in the way but lord god in our hearts lord we we we desire truth in the inward part lord as david said in psalms lord we love you we ask you these things now in the name of the lord jesus christ forgive us for our sins now and continue to be with these requests that were mentioned this evening we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you may be seated amen now let's read if you want to turn with me to romans chapter 12 and we'll read verse 1 and 2 there it says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and watch in verse 2 and be not conformed to this world why because the world has a certain mindset right the world has a certain a certain way that they that they go they have their own style they have their own idea and they have their own agendas and they have their own things that they think is is is is what's what's cool what's hip what's what's what's what's in and i'm knowing that everything that we have gotten from the time from the older one in here to the the most the youngest one things have changed since then the styles that you used to wear the the the the clothes that you used to wear maybe you don't wear anymore why because things change styles change the way people uh uh even their houses change the the way you you you you decorate your home changes all those things change now we see uh uh houses and they're pretty too i mean they're painting the houses now white and black you know it's it's a nice style it's pretty but five years down the road 10 years down the road it'll be something else because man is never satisfied with their own stuff oh my but the word of god is totally different for a christian amen it satisfies the soul and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that's how we are transformed by having your mind renewed washed cleansed amen that ye may prove that it that that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god i like the way that that scripture says it in romans chapter there in romans 12 in in the new living version it says don't copy the behavior and customs of the world but but let god transform you into a new person by changing the way you think so so god god will do his part when you do your part right god has given us his thoughts right so you start thinking his thoughts that's you changing the way you think therefore god can transform you amen he can only transform you through his word he's not going to give you something outside of his word amen so that's why we have to be subject to the word but let god transform you into a new person by changing the way you think then you will learn to know god's will for you which is good and pleasing and perfect amen so just as a as a as a as a as a review from last time um you know paul wouldn't have said this if if if our minds weren't already needed to be renewed you see we have to have our minds renewed day by day that's why it's so important for us to continue in the word to be steadfast reading praying meditating on god amen and anything else that would take the place of that amen is is trying to shift your thought process away from the word of god they might not be bad it might be it might be good it might be might be something that that's good but but if we keep our thoughts on god amen if we keep our mind set on god then he can renew our mind amen he can change our mind so so we need to have our minds renewed you know because sometimes sometimes when i think we don't but we do that's really when you do if you think that and and and so uh we talked about last time about our thoughts how they're transforming amen they're they're powerful thoughts are powerful amen and we don't take them as seriously as we should amen and we know that thoughts relate to words and and words are highly important amen you you take your husbands for example you say something a certain way to to your wife uh you better be careful [Laughter] you might mean something else but it's the way you said it or or or or the or the words that you chose amen you see but then you you choose a different type of word amen and it'll just cause her to just sweep her off her feet you see what's the one the the one that brother ernie used to always say about the something about the clock or something like that something you you're you your face your face makes time stand still yeah and be careful the way you say that and not what you mean something on that line better not go there sweetheart that wasn't for you all right and we know that brother branham said that a word is a thought expressed or in other words thoughts are are uh thoughts are are capsules or thought containers amen they're they're thought containers you see god had to think it first then it became word then it became then it became intuition amen everything that we that we touch everything that we look at everything that we see even you and me as we're looking at each other you were thoughts in god's mind all these things around us were thoughts in god's mind expressed and you're beautiful you're unique in your own way amen brother branham says in in in in in the message law or grace he says when god speaks it has to be so there's no way to at all to get away from it god says let there be and it has to be the very word itself and the word was a thought god went and then he says a word is an expression of a thought god thought it in his minds and then spoke it into existence see god can't think things and then and then just be thoughts they have to come to fruition they they have to they have to come something has to come out of those thoughts they can't just be thoughts in his mind it can't just be something they're head knowledge that's why god doesn't want us to just have head knowledge god didn't give us the word of god for just head knowledge no he gave us the word of god so that we could take those thoughts in amen process them and then put them into action manifest them bring something into manifestation it's not it's not about head knowledge it's about manifesting the word of god or the thought of god amen praise the lord so we know that god's thoughts that are revealed in his word and we see him through creation amen we we talked a little bit last week in or last time in regards to how uh the uh uh if god's thoughts bring life amen then we we see how the the the the society today is anti-life amen and we see it in different avenues amen through the lgbtq agendas we see it through abortion agendas we see it through all these different things amen and when you are involved in those different things or when you constantly ponder upon those things amen they do not bring life amen they they they we'll read some some staggering to statistics here uh that ever since the uh the the the pandemic how mental health has increased the the the the people's mental people people mentally are breaking down amen it's sad to see and you would think that you know all the push of the lgbtq and all of that amen would would be making people happy they're expressing their their their way of life the the what they feel inside they they're expressing it and you think that that would make them happy but the lgbtq community is the most depressed people it's statistics so because you know the word gay means happy so they're really not happy people and it's not the way that they're trying to portray it to you on tv and in the news now i want to make something clear from last time we are not we as christians we are not against we don't wrestle against flesh and blood no we don't wrestle against flesh and blood i i have nothing against personally against anybody individually that that that has that lifestyle or that chooses to live that way i will shake with my hand i will i will sit down and eat with them then i have no problem i have no qualm because hey that could be the opportunity for them to see the light of christ in my life amen but it but it's it's it's when they're it's it's when they're trying to make me like their lifestyle that is when it's wrong because i'm not trying to make them like my lifestyle right you can you can live you can be a christian and not even say anything just live the life of christ in front of people and they will be able to see amen christ in you and you wouldn't have said not one word amen there's true christians that way praise the lord but it's when you're forcing it upon people or when you're forcing it upon our kids in school that's when we have to we have to put the line down you don't force anything on anybody just like i can't push a cigarette in brother boyd's mouth you're going to smoke the cigarette no i can't do that amen but the problem is is that in the media and all these different avenues that's what they're trying to do and and it's happening in schools they are force feeding it on our kids they are force feeding it and that's when that's when it becomes wrong that's when it becomes wrong so i just want to make that clear i i have nothing against amen the people per se the individuals i i've had friends like that my wife she went to school with people like that bella's gone to school with people like that we don't we don't we don't hate them amen we just we just we we don't we we dislike their lifestyle amen but not them personally it's just like brother branham said we don't hate the people in the nomination or in organizations we hate the organization we hate that belief that belief system that that binds people that that that that that causes people to to not believe upon the whole word of god you see and and you know and you might be wondering why is brother luis up there talking about the lgbtq community and and all these different issues let me i'm just going to say that we our young people are facing these things you see and i just feel compelled that through i'm trying to compare the thoughts of god versus the thoughts of the world because our young people are so bombarded with the thoughts of the world if they don't have the holy ghost if they're not born again that's what they're going to be attracted to you know youtube influencers people that seem like they know what they're talking about on youtube and on all on tick tock and all these all these different avenues and so if you are not grounded in the word of god your thought process is just going to go anywhere and everywhere but but but we have an absolute amen we have an absolute and our absolute is not the youtube influencer our absolute is not the tick tock influencer our absolute is the word of god amen our absolute is not even brother branham yeah it's not brother branham's absolute was the word of god and because he preached the word of god that's that's that's my absolute den amen some people don't like to hear that but it's the truth i believe that with all my heart amen wow so so say so the attack on life is so is relentless today we gave we gave the example of how the word of god amen in genesis we see god male and female created he them amen and and i don't see any other genders there but male and female created he them them was the only pronoun that he used there and that [Laughter] you know all the different you gotta call me this you gotta respect this you gotta respect my pronouns and all that that has never existed until now because the world is going insane it's a mental thing and it and and you want to be called something of some sort of pronoun it i'll if you're a girl you're a girl you're a woman because i go back to the word of god you're you're you're you're female and now they don't know what a woman is they forgot what a woman is but the animals know the animals never forgot what a female is when they stood they don't have no qualms with about it whatsoever but we who are supposed to be more intelligent than than animals we don't know what a woman is yeah there's a supreme court uh nominee or i think is a supreme court nominee they asked her and they said can you please tell us what a woman is and she said i can't give you the i can't give you an answer and she's a woman herself it's because they're so scared to offend jesus offended left and right john the baptist offended left and right paul offended left and right one is the truth it's the truth amen praise the lord so it's all these different all these different pronouns and things so we talked about that so and we talked about what are god's thoughts about you god has thoughts about you amen in jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 he says for i know the thoughts that i think towards you amen and set the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end amen now let's let's go ahead we'll start here amen so so thoughts we know that they're not insignificant how many can agree with me on that they're not insignificant amen thoughts are very important as i said last time you thought about coming to church today and here you are it came to fruition amen and and and you you you think and then you do amen amen i mean everything that we've done in our life we we we we have thought about it first praise the lord and there and there's no such thing amen in life as thinking about something and and it doesn't have an effect on you it does have an effect on you amen it's very important what you think about amen because it will affect you it will affect you spiritually it will affect you physically and it will cause you to do or not do amen i mean see god gave us inlets right what are the inlets to the soul brother brahma said is the eyes amen we'll we'll touch on those things later but amen but he gave us the ears and he gave us the different inlets amen that get into our spirit realm right that affect our conscious reasoning and and and and those i always forget them but but but but all those things amen affect our spirit man and they're somewhat they're connected to also to the soul because from there from the spirit amen then it comes to the soul and then from the soul you have to either it's it's either you believe or you or you disbelieve it's either faith or doubt so first it has to come in through the inlets of the body whatever it is then it goes into the spirit realm and then and you're thinking about it you're meditating on those things and then eventually it will get down to your soul where you either believe the word of god or you reject the word of god but they first had to come in through the ear they first have to come in through the eye that's why young people that's why it's so important for you to be careful what you listen to because if it'll affect your spirit realm and then it'll affect your soul it's so important for what you watch because it'll it'll it brother brown said himself it it it it directly this is the gateway to the soul but you see it goes through the spirit realm amen and you process it what you saw and then it either had it affects your soul whether to believe the word of god or doubt the word of god amen so we see examples in in the word of god about you know when bad thoughts bad thinking turned into action amen we reminded of that story with the there in uh uh david had a a son amen and and and he had a half sister and amnon was his name and he raped his own half-sister now he just didn't wake up one morning and said i'm just going to do it no he thought about that for a long time and how he was going to pro how is he going how is he gonna bring that about i know that's a terrible story to bring about but i thought it was a good example about bad thinking bad thinking eventually led to bad behavior and it caused the whole havoc in in the kingdom of david later on in in his life all from one thought now you tell me thoughts aren't important they're very important all from one thought judas didn't wake up one morning and said i'm gonna just betray jesus i'm gonna sell him out no he thought about that for a while you know he was with jesus three and a half years you know and eventually the thought manifested in the spirit and the greediness amen that he had for the money the lust for the money sold jesus out amen now those are just two examples you can there's multiple lots of examples of thoughts producing terrible consequences bad thoughts so we should guard our thoughts right amen we should guard our thoughts so what is the thought can you touch a thought can you smell a thought can you taste a thought i thought i tasted it no that's just you haven't brushed your teeth yet [Music] [Laughter] thoughts thoughts are in the spirit realm right i'm just trying to make y'all laugh so you could keep keep keep listening so thoughts are spiritual right you can't you can't touch taste feel or smell thoughts man but what they what a thought will cause a reaction we'll we'll we'll bring something about i meant that you eventually will be able to touch taste feel and smell right i mean somebody had to thought about that fragrance of that perfume that you love to wear sister and they thought about taking this particular ingredient and this particular with some alcohol and this particular ingredient and adding this to create that that you that you love to put on yeah see somebody's thought came into manifestation and now you're wearing that thought is that right that's right it's holy word it's a thought expressed thoughts expressed amen so what is a thought webster's dictionary says that something that is a thought such as an individual act or product of thinking the brothers can bring this up a developed intention or plan in other words you can say for example i had no thought of leaving home amen a developed intention or plan something such as an opinion or belief in the mind and they give the sentence here he spoke his thoughts freely the intellectual product or the organized views and principles of a period place group or individual the action or process of thinking serious consideration reasoning power the power to imagine amen the power to imagine so there is power in imagining there's power in thoughts thoughts are creative remember that and you and i as human beings not just as sons and daughters of god remember this you and i are creators and that's the reason why satan hates us because he knows that we are creators and then when when we become christians my that completes the whole the whole thing then we are creators we're creators of the atmosphere we we we we we offer to people we're creators of things amen we produce things the human being is very intelligent as you can see what is mental you use the word mental what is that can you smell mental can you see mental you can't it's all spiritual now last month we had what was called may uh mental health awareness and and and so that's why i wanted to read a few of these things that i thought it was shocking just in the last two years just in the last two years i'm not going to read all of this but but just in the last two years this was in april of this year the mental health in kobe 19 two years into the pandemic mental health concerns continue to increase now and it says here that the number of people looking online for help with their mental health increased significantly from 2019 to 2021. in 2021 over 5.4 million people took a mental health screen representing a nearly 500 percent increase over the number of people who completed a screening in 2019 and 103 increase over 2020. this is from the if you want to you can read these facts yourself this is from mentalhealthamerica.org i believe is their website more youth more youth are struggling with their mental health and are seeking support online 45 percent of individuals in the us who took a screen in 2021 were youth ages 11 through 17 16 16 higher than the average in 2019 i i i wanted to read these to you parents because uh i don't want you to overlook when your kid is saying i have mental problems i know it's easy for us to to to think that but it's a spirit we're that's the spirit that we are living in in this hour and the only thing that can combat the spirit is the word of god so you fill yourself up with the word of god with god's thoughts till you can be able to help your child with god's thinking amen but it's real and the pandemic and the covet 19 and all the mask wearing didn't help it actually created it more the largest increases in the percentage of people scoring positive from 2019 to 2021 on this mental health screening here on their website were on the parent and youth screens indicating a large increase in the percentage of youth experiencing emotional attentional or behavioral difficulties during the pandemic there was there was also significant increases in the percentage of people scoring at risk for ptsd severe anxiety and psychotic-like experiences from from 2019 to 2021. the number and percentage of people screening with moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety remain higher than rates prior to covet 19. and that gives all the numbers i just don't have black individuals in the u.s had the largest increase in anxiety during the pandemic compared to other races and ethnicities the percentage of black individuals screening with symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety increased five percent from 2019 to 2021. the percentage of people in the us reporting frequent thoughts of suicide and self-harm in 2021 is the highest recorded since this screening program was launched in 2014. there are more people now thinking about killing themselves than ever before overall 39 of individuals in the u.s who took the depression screen reported frequent suicidal ideation in 2021. this was 8 higher than the average rate of suicidal ideation in 2019 and two percent higher than the rate in 2020. rates of suicidal ideation are highest among youth especially lgbtq plus youth overall 51 of all youth depression screeners ages 11 through 17 reported frequent suicidal ideation on more than half of nearly every day of the previous two weeks 63 of youth ages 11 through 17 who identified as lgbtq reported frequent suicidal ideation that percentage are not happy how can you be happy when you're outside of the word of god you can't suicidal ideation has increased most for black youth and adults from 2019 to 2021. but they got they got the black the black youth out there marching in the streets and stuff thinking that their god and they're all depressed see what you watch on tv is not real it is just agendas trying to push things into your mind in reporters over 300 000 people took a psychosis screen in 2021 people screening at risk for mental health conditions are struggling most with loneliness or isolation the differences in the things contributing most to mental health concerns among individuals of different races and a nested east reveal inequities in the experience of 2021 2020 and 2021. covet 19 has had a profound negative effect on the mental health of the nation throughout the kobe 19 pandemic mha which is this website has witnessed increasing numbers of people experiencing anxiety depression psychosis loneliness and other mental health concerns the problem i have with that statement is that covet 19 didn't do it it was the it was the laws passed after covert 19 that did that kobe 19 doesn't do it the kobe 19 didn't put a mask on your face covet 19 didn't do those things it was laws that was passed that caused that lgbt lgbtq individuals are more than twice as likely as heterosexual to have a mental illness those in the lgbtq community are 2.5 times more likely to experience depression anxiety than heterosexuals 31 percent of older adults in the lgbq community report depressive symptoms women who identify as lesbian or bisexual more than twice as likely to engage in heavy drinking than heterosexual women because they're depressed they're not finding peace in what in their lifestyle and then it talks about you know all the suicide that we just read in that community so is satan dealing with mind with the thoughts he better believe he is and he's working overtime that's why i feel that this topic is very important i mean because it's hard it's hard for you and for our youth to concentrate on on on the word of god that we've been preaching here brother brother dale brother wade bringing wonderful things in regards to the son of man uh our the other ministers and the things that brother dale has brought throughout the years when they got all these things bombarding them they can't concentrate on the son of man they can't concentrate on on on on daniel 70 weeks and things like that when when these things when you when we tell them oh you somehow they'll just get through it amen they have to be addressed they have to be talked about praise the lord so the bible talks about being either spiritually minded or carnally minded it's one of the two there's a scripture we'll read later man there is no in between right you can't you can't but there's no in between you're either carnally minded or spiritually minded there's no gray area amen praise god now last time we had talked about uh abortion and the evil laws and thoughts being introduced around it amen and and and we know that in this last day jesus said in his word that that as it was in the days of noah right as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man right what are we believing in those days man what happened in the days of noah what was going on in the days of noah this is what genesis 6 5 says and god saw that the wickedness of man the wickedness of man was great in the earth it was great it wasn't just just bad it was great and that's not great like oh man that's awesome no it was really really bad now remember jesus said as it was in the days of noah amen was great in the earth and that every every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually that right there that right there is a scope of the political world of the science world of the youth of that day of the of the middle age of that day the elderly of that day everything because when we think about noah's day we only think about uh a boat and noah and his family but you gotta remember there was a society a huge society just all just like ours and today and they had they had political things going on they had issues agendas and all these things amen jesus said as it was in the days of this day and he also said as it was in the days of sodom and gomorrah now we we we think that the sodomites and the the people in gamora we think that they're they're just like the drunk man with the flies hang you know around his mouth you know that they're just people that were not smart they had they had governments they were they were they were people they were they were they were they were people but they had some they had a terrible thought process it got so bad that they were trying to knock people's doors to just go in there and sleep with their own kind you don't think that in this day it can't turn into that it's we're heading that way and they're targeting you and me as christians oh they hate christians we get in their way we get in their way so every imagination of the thoughts of his heart and so when you look at that word imagination in that verse is the hebrew word yet sir and it means a form of framing a purpose amen this word is is related to the word yat sar which means to form fashion frame to form fashion of human activity of divine activity of creation of original creation of individuals at conception and predetermined preordained to be formed amen in other words it's like it's it's the same word that that that is used if for example like a like a potter when he is forming when he's when he's going to form that vessel that he that he's amen that he's thought about in order for him to form that vessel that that vase or that thing amen he had to think about it first it was an imagination in his heart right it was something that was really amen uh um uh um i suppose what's the word i'm looking for it it was causing him excitement in other words and then he goes on and works on it you see praise the lord and so when when when the when he creates that vase or he creates that that pottery or whatever it is amen all it is amen all it is that pottery reflects amen that that pottery existed somewhere before and it existed in the thoughts of of of the potter right it existed in his mind and man you think about that saints amen you and i men who are here and who are or who are looking at are lit trying to live the word of god amen raise the lord we we we existed in the mind of god we were special in the mind of god amen and god put us here exactly at the right moment at the right time at the right age you are here at the right age oh i wish i lived in martin's stage no you couldn't have survived it i wish i wish i lived when jesus was here you couldn't have survived it but he knew you could have survived this age oh this is the worst age ever but you are here was he was he going to have christians was he going to have believers in laodicea absolutely and you are one of them and he said that you are overcomers in this age i like the other brother the other day man and i believe that lafontaines they sing a song like that amen this is she the bride of the last age amen they're going to be amazed that you overcame this age paul will shake your hand paul will will will want to know how you did it we always look to paul we look at paul and we think my paul was just an overcomer and he was but you are an overcomer even greater paul didn't get didn't live in the age that we live in now it's a terrible age that we live in but we are here to overcome saints praise the lord so thoughts they're powerful how many are still with me crazy i know that i'm going slow i'm not running around and hey man this i just don't think we're gonna get everything if we i mean i got my my way in so we gotta we gotta we gotta be who we are amen thoughts are powerful and they can lead to inactions or or or actions yeah i'm gonna brag on my on my daughter here i'm very proud of her and i'm mainly proud of her because she you know two years ago you know she was struggling with with depression type spirits and things like that now she was going to public school and and she would hide those things she she wouldn't tell us later on you know she told us you know she was good at hiding those those those things but i think that's partly why it didn't help her but you know we we talked with her and we try to help and and you know sometimes those frustrating moments because you know you're like how can how can you think like that or you know because you in your mind as a parent you don't think that that's real to them you you see but it's real it's real but she told she told my wife and me uh she said you know mommy the way i overcame those things is that i had to choose on my own to overcome i didn't i didn't you know i could have quoted her all kinds of scriptures i could i could have given her printed out all kinds of quotes giving her all kinds of statistics anything but until she thought herself to say i'm through with this and move on she wasn't gonna may overcome it and that's how you're going to overcome it until you say take the word of god seriously and take it personally and say the the lord your thoughts is what's going to move me i'm not going to be moved by my feelings anymore i'm not going to be moved by my own thoughts i'm not going to be moved by my own opinions it's your thoughts or nothing it's your promises or nothing amen then you're not going to get out of your slump you're not going to get out of your rut you're not going to get out exactly i just needed to brag on that because that was an inspiration to me because i i i i tend to be sometimes you know i you know and she knows not the family no i've i've had to confess to them papi has not been the the the best in faith these last two years because we let the world and the cosmos around us push us around you see but but when i grabbed a hold of these scriptures amen in philippians chapter 4 to think on these things amen that just changed my world differently amen praise god so you know and so she had to decide on her own you know thoughts thoughts uh they they can make your body feel a certain way they can make you uh you know smell a certain way if you're not careful now i want to do something here for just a moment i want you to think about for example think of this think just close your eyes because i want you to think all right close your eyes now i want you to start thinking about mosquitoes start thinking about about flies start thinking about about about things flying around you has it does anybody and the longer you start thinking you're going to start i want to see somebody who starts scratching themselves [Laughter] right makes you itchy i know my wife when she she starts getting itchy you can open your eyes now my my wife starts getting itchier when she starts thinking about snakes cockroaches moving those antennas and oh i know somebody here who hates it i'm already getting a reaction right now [Laughter] esther esther black hates cockroaches now i want you to start close your eyes again and i want you to think about lemons putting a lemon in your mouth anna hey i want you can open them as soon as i start as soon as she started thinking about that her face went like this you see your thought you just thought about lemons we have no lemons here there's no chick-fil-a lemonade or anything like that where there's no lemons you just thought about it and it caused you to act right and then when you if i were to ask you start thinking about food those are those who are those of you who are hungry oh my your mouth is going to start getting watery your you know your your belly's going to start growling going to cause it's going to make a reaction right but thoughts are not important thoughts bring reactions thoughts make you make you react a certain way amen praise the lord so so i just thought i'd bring that because i was hoping to get a reaction and i did anna and esther [Laughter] amen and so so that there you know there's thoughts that we can think about you know you just thought about lemons you thought about mosquitoes and all those things but then there's thoughts amen that excite you brother terrence when you think about your grandchildren does it make you sad depressed oh i gotta hold them again i bet you when you're thinking about your grandchildren and and what their futures can be i bet you that makes you excited and you haven't not even seen them in the future yet and that's already exciting see so why is the word of god telling us to think on these things amen think on the word because it because it will produce an action will it produce for you to hate your brother not according to the word when you're thinking on the word will it produce for you to to uh to back bite your brother or to or to uh go rob a store no not not if you're thinking on these thoughts amen think on these things there's thoughts amen that you're going to think about but that you think about that it will rob you from your peace it will rob you from your blessings from your joy it will rob you from all those things it'll make you negative it'll make you grouchy it'll make you hate people for for no cause i've i've experienced that it'll make you think that you're better than somebody else and you don't even know that person yourself just by what you think just about what you led in your mind and you have not even met that person you haven't you've not even talked to that individual and you already think that you're better than them just by what you're thinking amen it takes the peace and it drains you spiritually emotionally amen so if god's words are an expression of his thinking then satan's words are expressions of his own thinking right praise the lord and we talked about last week last time amen how satan came in and then and he he expressed his own thoughts to eve and how eve took on the thought you see eve had to had to think about what satan was telling her what the serpent was telling her then it came into manifestation then she did the act brother dale he preached about this several years ago and and and it's not just that she did the act right there and then no it had to be satan working with her for a while it could have been 10 years it could have been 15 it could have been a hundred years i don't know but satan was working just working to try to mold the mind trying to mold the mind the mind the the thoughts amen and that's why i was saying last time our young girls be careful when guys young men come and approach you in certain ways asking you certain inappropriate questions that's not the thoughts of god that boy has an agenda that young man has an agenda maybe he doesn't know that he's doing wrong but you be careful you you be so filled with god's thinking that you won't let that type of thinking take over you because the boy amen that those boys amen will get to your mind first if they get to your to your to what they really want first to your body then then that that would be that'll be rape but but but those that are they get to your mind first hey and they could be one year two years three years it doesn't matter that satan was patient so you so you be careful young girls amen who you entertain in your life well you're entertaining in your life it's very important so you and i we've become what we've thought about amen if you think about learning to play the guitar if that's what you're always thinking about zach being one for example brother aaron amen they thought about it and we see it in manifestation bella thought about she was playing the violin we see her playing the violin zoe you see whatever you think about that's what you're going to become amen i thought about building websites when i was younger amen now i have a job in that way you see things like that you see you think about gardening amen and that's what you're always constantly thinking about and you're going to go out there and garden by the way didn't just wake up one morning and said i'm just gonna garden no he he was probably planting or i'm gonna i'm do some beehives put some beehives it took some planning some reading of some books some education amen feeling filling with those thoughts and then it came into fruition amen praise the lord praise god we're not when i was gonna you know my mom says that when i was a young boy that i used to talk a lot and uh now nowadays i'm just trying kind of trying to prove her wrong on that now because she saw me at that time yeah and i was i i would she would tell me that i would go around and uh to the neighbors out in in in columbia south america not just about five years old and i'd go knocking the neighbors doors the ladies the uh the the women and uh and i'd just go in there and just start talking to him and they and they would come to my mom and my to my mom their neighbors and friends to my mom he's just so cute he just goes in there just talking to us and just telling us things ain't no telling what i was telling them my mom was probably like really but i would i have no i would have no qualms about going in there and talking to people see the later on the lord using that amen to minister the gospel a man to preach i had no idea i never wanted to to i never thought i'd be preaching the word but then then at one point at some point in time back in 2008 2007 2008 the lord started really dealing with me strongly on that and and it had to be thoughts i was thinking about it and then finally there at brother gene williams church i was i talked to him about it and and and it came into fruition so here i am a thought expressed right praise the lord so so in jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 so he says for i know the thoughts that i think toward you he knows the thoughts that he thinks towards you and we're going to finish here in just a moment for i know the thoughts that i think towards you seth the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil amen he has thoughts of peace about you what are his thoughts his thoughts are his word amen that's the reason why paul says think on these things because those thoughts right there are his word and so he tells us to think on those things so that that's why he says they're thoughts of peace because remember what paul said in philippians chapter 4 he said when you think on these things it'll bring peace it'll bring these things that you that you so desire to give you what an expected end amen that's why young people we say always put the lord first in your life amen always put god's thoughts first before anything else before any of your plans put god's thoughts first because god's thoughts will give you peace and peace about what you're going to do or not going to do see god will give you peace about whether you should go that route or not but only if you put god's thoughts first because his thoughts are always thoughts of peace of you and not of evil to give you an expected end to give you an and that he's already thought of you before the foundation of the world he knew you he loved you and he made a way for you they're thoughts of peace so just step into his thoughts step into this and he in his thinking praise the lord no aren't you aren't you thankful that we were in his thoughts amen and and and that his thoughts are to bring us peace saints is what drove him to die on the cross for us it's what drove him amen to to while you were under what how's the song go while he was on the cross you were on his mind they didn't do it for himself he did it for you and i you he was thinking of you and he was just continuing that thought process the same thought that he thought of you from the beginning before the foundation of the world he was just continuing that thought process while he was on the cross i'm so thankful for that amen let's talk about abraham for just a moment abraham embraced god thought god's thoughts right he was told amen he was going to have a promised son and he was like how in his mental in his human way but it came a point amen that he's like okay lord you're gonna have to do it i can't do it you said it and i'm just gonna stand on it and believe it praise god he told him already that his descendants were going to be innumerable as the stars how is this god that that brought me out of my out of the land of where i came from where i was born he has led me all this way he's talked to me he's told me these things and and he has made me prosper and now he's telling me that he's going to give me a son he's going to give me descendants they were innumerable more than the stars what's more enumerable than the stars or the sands of the the grains of sand than the oh at the beach and you can think you can think how in the world is that going to happen humanly he probably thought that but all he had to do was rest on that thought he had to align his thoughts with god's thoughts man i can't explain some of the things in the word but i'll align my thinking towards that word i don't know how it's going to happen i don't know how how it will but if i think the way he thinks it'll come to pass amen praise the lord and then and that please god saints when you believe his thoughts and and you cling to them that pleases god they pleased god that abraham hung to his thoughts you don't have to know all the details of how it's going to happen i'm a hundred years old and he's saying i'm going to have a baby that's not for you to figure out abraham god will deal with that amen amen so i want to leave you with this i want us to cling to the to to to the thoughts of god all right and remember that i'm gonna we're gonna keep talking about this but i want us to cling to those to the healing thoughts to these healing thoughts and brothers can bring these scriptures you need healing in your life cling to these thoughts jeremiah 17 14 heal me o lord and i will be healed now i may be he'll i will be healed save me and i will be saved for you are the one i praise jeremiah 30 17 but i will restore you to health and heal your wounds declares the lord he said it that's his thoughts how is he going to do it i don't know he could do it through the elixir that that sister regina took the other day or or the or he could do it through the doctor through a surgery or he could do it instantaneously but he just said he did it he will do it amen exodus 23 25 worship the lord your god and his blessing will be on your food and water i will take away sickness from among you this was right before the children when the children of israel were where were were left egypt god protected them while they were in in the in the desert in the wilderness with nothing there was no walmart around there was no racetrack or q t nothing god was a racetrack god was their qt god was their walmart and he was more than that he was the creator some of us what would we do if we didn't have racetrack and qt be able to get our big gulps and and i don't see how some of y'all drink that but they didn't have none of that but god provided for them isaiah 53 4-5 surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering yet we considered him punished by god stricken by him and afflicted but he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we are healed and that's another that's another version that's another version of the bible cling to those thoughts don't cling on your on your on your feelings cling to those thoughts amen i want you i want you all to have wayward children cling on these thoughts i have wayward loved ones cling on on these thoughts right here romans 12 rejoice in hope be patient in tribulation be constant in prayer amen you can't change the circumstance but god can change the circumstance amen for your family member romans 8 28 and we know that for those who love god all things work together for good for those who are called according to his purpose what a blessed thought that is proverbs 14 26 in the fear of the lord there is strong confidence and his children will have refuge in psalm 89 4 thy seed will establish will i establish forever and build up thy throne to all generations now he was talking to he was talking to to israel amen but the word of god is for all of us so god promised me my seed and i will believe that i don't know how they're going to come in i don't know what how it's going to happen i don't know i don't know what what's going to happen what god needs to do in order to get him to a place amen that they repent they receive the baptism of the holy ghost but god said that he will do it because his seed amen your seed amen your offspring god promised it to if you are claiming his thoughts about it amen then god has to fulfill his thinking because you're aligning your thoughts with his thoughts praise the lord jesus praise the lord so i want you to think on these things and i could give you these scriptures i can maybe put them on the whatsapp group if you need them put them on there think on those things i'll leave you with those thoughts we'll continue next time amen [Applause] our thoughts our thoughts will will our will will create things amen and i always remember that you are creator praise the lord you are you are you are a creator but it has to start with thinking first the right mental attitude towards god's thoughts or the right mental attitude towards the promises of god brother branham said we'll bring them to pass amen so it starts with your thinking if you take the word of god and you say i i just read isaiah and i believe it but you're not aligning yourself with god's thoughts you're not that won't bring the results amen but when you when you take god's word no matter how ridiculous it sounds and you say i believe it i'm gonna take it to me personally and i'm just going to express it you go around expressing and you go around saying i'm healed whether i feel bad or good god bless brother wade past year and a half or so that he's been battling with his heart amen he comes up here preaching and everything like that i could tell sometimes he's not feeling good he's been much better now thank god god heals through whatever avenue it needs to do amen but you know what you have to push through it's an overcoming it's an overcoming it's taking god's word and just pushing through and whether hey hey whether you're preaching the word of god i'm having heart issues whatever if i fall dead here at the pulpit well it's one of the best places to fall dead at preaching the word of god you have a testimony then and it'll be on youtube [Laughter] that man died preaching and there's there's people that that have died and they're preaching well nothing why not that's a good way to go that's a that man died doing something good amen praise the lord jesus you pray for brother wade pray for brother
