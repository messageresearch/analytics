[9:55] there's many many things have your way
[9:57] and let your grace and love be with us
[9:59] in Jesus name let's go to first Peter
[10:08] 1:22
[10:12] seeing you have purified your souls and
[10:15] obeying the truth through the spirit
[10:16] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren so
[10:19] that you love one another with a pure
[10:21] heart fervently being born again not of
[10:24] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[10:27] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[10:30] forever and never we're talking about
[10:32] and had the thought now for quite a
[10:34] while of being born being born again as
[10:39] a process this trench you know it's in
[10:42] motion and will stay in motion until our
[10:45] bodily change comes you know and it will
[10:49] finish then into that chain so we're
[10:52] kind of move up a little bit today and
[10:54] kind of strike a few things but now
[10:56] let's go to Ephesians because we'll pick
[11:01] up our thought from Ephesians 1 excuse
[11:05] me yeah seasons 1 verse 3 blessed be the
[11:09] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[11:10] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[11:12] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[11:15] according as he has chosen us in
[11:17] him before the foundation of the world
[11:20] that we should be holding without blame
[11:22] before him in love having predestinated
[11:25] us unto the adoption of children by
[11:29] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[11:33] good pleasure of his will you may be
[11:36] seated
[11:37] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[11:40] of the word all right now we're we've
[11:43] been quite a while as I was saying
[11:46] talking about the process of being born
[11:51] again that you know I believe it starts
[11:55] by the new birth when Christ comes into
[11:58] our soul and gives eternal life to that
[12:01] soul that that starts your process of a
[12:05] birth all right now even in your stature
[12:08] of a perfect man that you were supposed
[12:10] to have read to listen to the Prophet
[12:13] you hear him and are talking about and
[12:15] blasphemous name how did you birth into
[12:18] this birth into this birth into this now
[12:21] remember there's one new birth but
[12:23] there's many births in the basis of a
[12:26] growing forth because a birth means
[12:28] they're coming forth into that's really
[12:30] what it means a baby comes in to the
[12:33] world it's birthed into the world all
[12:35] right so then in the gospel in the
[12:38] statue of a perfect man it's supposed to
[12:40] be not new births you don't have seven
[12:44] you burst but maybe you have in
[12:47] manifestation or whatever you want to
[12:50] call it you know phases stages whatever
[12:56] as to looking at that and seeing that
[12:59] you've birthed into this then we got to
[13:00] be birthed got to be birthed into virtue
[13:02] got to be worked in a knowledge birth
[13:04] into temperance
[13:05] it means of coming forth into it means
[13:08] you're growing up there was a time when
[13:10] you was young and you was looking
[13:12] forward to a time boy you know that one
[13:15] of these days I'll have a boyfriend I'll
[13:17] have a girlfriend I'll have a car I'll
[13:19] do you looking at the stage all right
[13:22] but then you reach that stage so you
[13:25] came forth into that stage so then it's
[13:29] not as I say now over and over
[13:31] it's not seven new burrs it means that
[13:35] that new birth is constantly growing
[13:38] inside of us just as it is in the
[13:42] natural rim and that's why Jesus will be
[13:45] using see and telling Nicodemus that you
[13:48] must be born again alright so then it's
[13:52] a process taking place in our hearts in
[13:55] our lives and it goes all of your
[13:58] Christian journey as I said from the new
[14:01] birth and it'll go all the way to the
[14:04] change of the body and then we can step
[14:07] into eternal life fully body soul spirit
[14:10] everything see in that way we will be
[14:14] actually birthed out of this world into
[14:18] eternity all right now hold that point
[14:22] and you you'll see what we're trying to
[14:23] get to all right now we talked about
[14:26] this past Wednesday on the little
[14:31] message titled at sonship because I want
[14:35] to make sure that we understand and
[14:37] follow it in the right order to where
[14:41] that we know what we're talking about is
[14:44] true but don't get lost with the way
[14:49] that I do things I've always been this
[14:51] away a background more than I go forward
[14:55] I guess you call it because you know
[14:58] everything has got to have a foundation
[15:00] all right then it's based from that
[15:03] foundation it grows from that and you
[15:05] keep on going so just because it I back
[15:08] up and talk a lot about the new birth
[15:10] when you're wanting me to go over here
[15:13] into this parks you know or something
[15:15] just remember that's the way that I've
[15:18] always done it and if you were going to
[15:20] school today that would be the way it is
[15:23] what you you background right and you
[15:28] keep background in not you got yours in
[15:31] there in your natural schooling that
[15:33] like one is bad hard to is a lot of
[15:37] background of one three is hard all
[15:40] right then
[15:41] for the background
[15:43] that is in the natural and if you take
[15:47] it and think about it that's the way our
[15:49] Christian journey grows as Christ as
[15:52] revealing himself to us in our new birth
[15:57] right and then we're being born again
[16:02] coming forth into manifestation of these
[16:06] things all right we've been declaring
[16:09] for quite a while that the new birth is
[16:14] what makes you a child of God it's not
[16:17] that we were born as I were covering our
[16:20] Wednesday night you know a lot of the
[16:22] people the message they say oh I've
[16:24] always was eternal I always was eternal
[16:27] within Jesus Christ died in vain that's
[16:29] just the best way to say it and then do
[16:32] you realize that what I was trying to
[16:35] say Wednesday that if you hold that
[16:38] always was eternal and didn't don't
[16:41] handle it correctly you know that you're
[16:43] making the Bible false prophecy because
[16:45] when Jesus Christ died not only did he
[16:48] die in vain because it wouldn't
[16:51] accomplish anything which you make it
[16:53] false prophecy because he prophesied
[16:56] that he was going to die
[16:58] the Bible said he was going to die all
[17:01] right then if he didn't die within what
[17:04] would he need to die for for us all
[17:07] right I know what the Prophet covers
[17:09] those things but remember read it real
[17:12] careful in the roundabout of where
[17:15] you're reading when he says who always
[17:17] was eternal read real careful and see if
[17:20] he doesn't say it like this if you have
[17:23] eternal life if you have eternal life
[17:27] the eternal life that you receive always
[17:30] was eternal but there was a time I
[17:33] didn't have it right no that's what I'm
[17:38] trying to declare our to bring out to
[17:42] where we can understand alright so 2nd
[17:45] Peter declares that we must receive the
[17:48] new birth I hope you caught these from
[17:51] the life story messages because I'm
[17:55] trying to make a point heavily on it
[17:58] that Peter in second Peter is declaring
[18:02] the new birth making us a child of God
[18:08] how faith be born again alright to these
[18:13] that have escaped the corruption that is
[18:15] in the world through lust etc Peter was
[18:17] saying that you must start off by a new
[18:20] birth all right that new birth is what
[18:23] makes us a child of God that's why Jesus
[18:26] said to Nicodemus you must be born again
[18:30] or you cannot see understand right you
[18:35] cannot see or understand you can't enter
[18:39] the kingdom without the new birth all
[18:42] right so then the Prophet said that's
[18:44] the most important thought and to me
[18:46] that's an amazing point that that was
[18:49] Jesus's first doctrine because you must
[18:52] be born again and the man couldn't
[18:56] understand it well then you're gonna see
[18:59] that it would naturally turn out to be
[19:01] the hardest doctrine to try to preach
[19:04] would be you must be born again then
[19:08] brother Branham spent all of his life
[19:10] preaching on those things trying to
[19:13] bring it down and it just constantly
[19:15] kept unfolding and a deeper depth the
[19:18] deeper depth you know until he comes on
[19:20] out into finally preaches on the stature
[19:23] of a perfect man all right now so we see
[19:27] that this faith to make you to wear that
[19:30] you're born into the kingdom by the new
[19:33] birth which is the birth of the word the
[19:37] word you taking you hold it and God
[19:39] quickens that word and makes it alive
[19:42] giving you a new birth in your soul
[19:45] making your soul to eternal all right
[19:48] now so we know Peter in what he's
[19:52] describing he's describing that to us
[19:57] all right we went through Paul and his
[20:01] example of adoption showing that when
[20:06] you're born into the family the
[20:11] natural story of adoption as a child was
[20:15] come into the family when it's born into
[20:18] the family it's a child of that family
[20:21] all right it doesn't have to join it or
[20:24] either it's a part of it
[20:25] all right and that's what Paul was
[20:28] explaining how the new birth and all of
[20:32] the things would be the same way as
[20:35] Peter was explaining it all of that is
[20:38] explaining the new birth to bringing
[20:41] Christ could come and live in each one
[20:43] of us in the born-again experience
[20:45] making us the children of God by faith
[20:49] in Jesus Christ accepting what he's done
[20:52] for us and then he accepts us and brings
[20:55] us into the family all right now Paul as
[20:59] I said he uses adoption but remember now
[21:04] Paul is giving an example of adoption
[21:13] all right now listen don't get confused
[21:17] on this little statement see an example
[21:21] is not always totally um word-for-word
[21:26] or perfect understanding or whatever you
[21:30] know it's an example to bring you to the
[21:35] position of understanding why are you
[21:38] following me then see Paul is taking the
[21:40] example of adoption I was not saying oh
[21:45] yeah you always was eternal and
[21:47] everything and I know he's telling you
[21:50] that you must be born again the entire
[21:53] Bible is expressing that we must be born
[21:56] again we must be born into the family of
[21:58] God all right
[22:00] see then in doing that Paul is is
[22:03] covering and using adoption as an
[22:06] example because remember now listen you
[22:16] don't come into the world with eternal
[22:18] life oh well I always was a son I always
[22:22] was a son
[22:24] you getting into examples without having
[22:28] the background of understanding and
[22:31] thereby you are cutting yourself off
[22:34] from the truth all right
[22:38] you didn't come into the world with
[22:39] eternal life I don't believe that I've
[22:41] never taught nothing like this I don't
[22:43] believe the Prophet ever taught it
[22:45] because if he taught it that away I
[22:46] can't find it and I've been through all
[22:49] of the things and if you got any quotes
[22:51] you want to be brought brangham we'll
[22:53] talk about him and see what he's talking
[22:55] about
[22:56] all right because Jesus wouldn't have
[22:59] started off if he's gonna be always was
[23:01] eternal point Jesus would have told
[23:03] Nicodemus Nicodemus just believe who you
[23:05] are you always was a son and he didn't
[23:09] tell him that he said you must be born
[23:11] again and then it did an amazing thing
[23:15] as I said that Paul I mean that that
[23:18] Jesus that that started the the doctrine
[23:22] of the new birth and how that Paul and
[23:26] Peter them would all lay right into that
[23:30] imperfect understanding to try to
[23:32] explain the things unto us all right now
[23:39] both Paul and Peter were both explaining
[23:43] the new birth in the writings of the
[23:46] Bible John does it go through it I was
[23:49] just set another day meditating a little
[23:51] on the different scriptures and the
[23:54] things you know just kind of let your
[23:56] mind run sometimes and think about
[23:58] seeing that's why I said it's our moment
[24:00] ago the entire Bible is the revelation
[24:02] of Jesus Christ in that wonderful so the
[24:07] entire Bible is declaring one thing one
[24:13] new birth it's declaring how you become
[24:17] a child of God the Bible is not
[24:20] declaring you always water child
[24:24] it's declaring how to become a child
[24:27] we're on sea thin by how you become a
[24:30] child brings you into the family of God
[24:33] and Paul is using that example of
[24:37] adoption
[24:39] that shows that you're naturally born
[24:42] into the family
[24:43] well I that represents your new birth
[24:49] the adoption of showing that you come
[24:52] into a natural family you were born into
[24:55] the family you come forth into that
[24:58] family all right and how many times
[25:02] would the Prophet say he said I was born
[25:04] to Branham I didn't become a brand um I
[25:07] was born to Brando
[25:08] all right that's right that's exactly
[25:11] right but he what he's never saying I
[25:14] was born to eternal so I don't need
[25:16] nothing no see that's where brother
[25:20] Branham says that I didn't I believe it
[25:22] was it blasphemous night where he said
[25:24] that that the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:27] was so missed halt
[25:29] so incorrectly talked because people
[25:33] think this is I think I said anything
[25:36] but see just get it simple to wear that
[25:38] we can look at it that the entire Bible
[25:42] whether it be Paul whether it be Peter
[25:44] whether it be James
[25:45] whether it be John any of the Gospels
[25:49] just read the Bible and as you read it
[25:52] that's what I was trying to emphasize
[25:54] from the scriptures that we've read in
[25:59] first Peter all right being born again
[26:04] and explaining the new birth then go to
[26:06] 2nd Peter and then he starts to growth
[26:09] development right I went back in Paul to
[26:14] pick up the collations
[26:16] and Paul in Galatians 3 is explaining a
[26:22] child born into the world or life or
[26:25] death and we needed to be born again
[26:27] then rot then Galatians 4:1 he goes into
[26:31] the adoption into the family by that
[26:35] child all right but now remember you got
[26:39] to get into the family right now you've
[26:45] got to get into the family cuz remember
[26:46] the natural stories on the top in it the
[26:51] natural story
[26:52] of you being born you know a collie or
[26:56] whatever you know not always would
[26:57] that's only a natural story showing you
[27:02] that to be that you must be born again
[27:05] all right now get that emphasis and hold
[27:10] the point it doesn't show us we always
[27:14] was it shows us what we need we need the
[27:19] new birth if we don't have the new birth
[27:22] we're not in the family of God all right
[27:28] but you see why that is so dangerous the
[27:32] way people preach too they just well I
[27:34] just felt I just read what the Prophet
[27:36] said he said we always was eternal amen
[27:41] amen that's right but it's a lot got to
[27:47] be understood to find out how
[27:50] but this remember now think on it and
[27:52] that's what my point the natural story
[27:56] is an example it doesn't always lay in
[28:03] the correct order
[28:04] of the natural to go to the spiritual
[28:09] the natural is a natural story all right
[28:14] sure you were born James Colley into the
[28:17] Colley family all right
[28:18] amen but that didn't make you a
[28:20] Christian you got to be born again to be
[28:24] a Christian you got to accept Jesus
[28:27] Christ as your Savior and let him them
[28:30] come and live in us making us the
[28:32] children of God in the new birth all
[28:36] right
[28:37] then bringing it into the new birth it
[28:41] brings you a child of God all right
[28:45] see that's why Jesus said except a man
[28:49] be born again he cannot see the kingdom
[28:56] all right so if you and I are not born
[29:00] again I don't care what examples you use
[29:02] or thoughts or ideas if
[29:05] you don't have the new birth you're not
[29:07] in the family of God
[29:09] right see then that's the main point
[29:14] yeah but brother so-and-so says it with
[29:16] us alright you go follow brother
[29:18] so-and-so do what you won't do that's
[29:20] your business that's between you and the
[29:22] Lord but as far as me and my house this
[29:25] is the way I've always taught it and
[29:27] it's well I always believed it you've
[29:29] got to be born again to do that you go
[29:34] through justification sanctification the
[29:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring you
[29:39] to the new birth all right it brings you
[29:43] to that new birth and that's what the
[29:44] disciples done that's the example always
[29:47] in betar in the scripture and then they
[29:50] received eternal life the word that they
[29:53] hailed was quickened unto them and that
[29:57] was the new birth it was not that they
[30:01] had the new work down through that no
[30:03] they didn't they had to receive the new
[30:06] birth it's not as you always was eternal
[30:09] it's you've got to be born again to have
[30:13] eternal life
[30:14] yeah but I've got this one one okay so
[30:17] what I'm saying you do what you want to
[30:18] I've just always tried to preach it to
[30:21] West the way that I understand it and
[30:24] and believing it that way you know that
[30:27] Jesus Christ died to release that life
[30:30] that it could come back in me not dying
[30:33] to release his life and all he went
[30:36] through for me to just get a knowledge
[30:37] that always was yes that's basically
[30:44] what people are teaching I always was
[30:47] what do I need I believe you need
[30:51] eternal life
[30:53] that's the best way that I can put it
[30:55] all right as I said now then Paul is
[30:58] giving an example of how that that baby
[31:05] is born into the family naturally born
[31:12] into the family it brings the child into
[31:16] the family which is what the new birth
[31:18] does to you and me the new birth brings
[31:22] us into the family of God then we need
[31:24] the tutors and the governor's in the end
[31:26] the child trainer to raise us all right
[31:30] we've got a lot to go we've got a lot of
[31:32] things to be considered but first is to
[31:35] get right where we're at that being born
[31:38] into the family of God by the new bird
[31:42] not just because if you go to church and
[31:44] believe the Prophet and everything else
[31:46] oh I I've got I just I just feel it I
[31:50] just you know people like that they just
[31:52] they uh well that's all right but listen
[31:59] this is the main point I want you now to
[32:01] think about the natural story of
[32:05] adoption shows the spiritual story of
[32:11] adoption the way Jesus was preaching in
[32:15] John 3 the natural story of adoption
[32:21] shows the spiritual story of adoption
[32:25] the natural story is what he's born into
[32:29] the family he was born to call you that
[32:32] made you in the family all right
[32:35] spiritually we got to know how to get
[32:37] into that family so it takes the new
[32:40] birth to get into the family of God all
[32:44] right now in doing that being see what I
[32:48] want us to think about is adoption and
[32:53] I've always taught it this away for ever
[32:56] since the beginning and I still teach it
[32:59] that way we'll try to get to it as much
[33:00] as we can this morning adoption then it
[33:04] has to be taught in stages
[33:09] alright cuz in the natural things are in
[33:13] stages you've come into your natural
[33:16] family and then they give you razors
[33:19] send them to school you know we do we
[33:21] don't have the tutors the governor's and
[33:23] the things that was the way they done
[33:25] back then they were doing and they were
[33:28] homeschooling we'd be more or less
[33:32] calling homeschooling you know all right
[33:34] but now think about it we must be
[33:41] brought into the family of God
[33:43] so adoption then we'll have to be taught
[33:46] in stages not just as one point all
[33:54] right that's just like the the fact of
[33:57] saying you're justified that's a work of
[34:00] the Holy Spirit
[34:01] you're sanctified that's the work of the
[34:04] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the Holy
[34:08] Spirit but it's three stages to bring us
[34:13] to a birth all right
[34:15] see they need to do those things that's
[34:18] why Nicodemus couldn't understand all he
[34:22] could taint within his natural mind well
[34:24] I got to go back to my mother and be
[34:26] born again
[34:27] we'll see Jesus was trying to tell if he
[34:30] born of water in morning and he was
[34:32] trying to explain to him what would it
[34:35] take to come into the body of Christ it
[34:37] would take justification by faith
[34:40] accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior it
[34:44] would take sanctification to come and
[34:46] cleanse the vessel and setting your side
[34:49] then it would take the coming of the
[34:52] holy spirit into your soul to make your
[34:56] soul eternal bringing you eternal life
[34:59] alright see then the new birth is in
[35:02] stages so then don't think it would stop
[35:08] just because you get born again that's
[35:11] what I said want to go your birth into
[35:13] this you burped into that you just keep
[35:15] on being burnt as these things come
[35:17] forth we've got to be birthed into the
[35:20] virtues and not only birth into the
[35:23] virtues we've got to be sealed see then
[35:28] there's no way itself why I've always
[35:30] emphasize to you you said well brother
[35:32] Dale I'm not working on these things
[35:34] down here I'm working on brotherly
[35:36] kindness I think I work on brother well
[35:39] what are you gonna do if you get it you
[35:42] got to seal these in to come up you got
[35:45] to build a pyramid to come on by
[35:46] sensible if you just look at it it's
[35:50] fine to deal with brotherly kindness go
[35:52] that's a wonderful thing but remember
[35:54] the very first thing you need in your
[35:56] Christian life is virtue now I'll tell
[36:02] you this to wear you to be used to it or
[36:04] or get to it what is it see where is it
[36:08] which is what does the scriptures in
[36:10] Galatians where we talk about the fruits
[36:12] of the spirit is love joy peace goodness
[36:15] me
[36:15] all right works for the flesh you know
[36:18] is this that now the fruits of the
[36:20] spirit fruits of the Spirit is the same
[36:22] thing as the virtues right you see what
[36:27] I'm talking about all these scriptural
[36:28] tie together the fruits of the spirit is
[36:31] love joy peace goodness meekness now in
[36:33] Christ Jesus because it's taking on his
[36:37] divine nature all right so the entire
[36:41] Bible is trying to get us to see a
[36:43] growth development and to try to get us
[36:47] to coming into manifestation of Jesus
[36:51] Christ into our hearts and our lives all
[36:54] right now see then putting the new birth
[36:58] let's start with that and just get the
[37:00] top because let's let's go ahead with
[37:02] number one brothers and we'll read it
[37:04] now this is a lot of readings so just
[37:06] buy with it but I want you to see that
[37:08] adoption now listen Paul said we read
[37:14] there that we're predestinated unto
[37:18] adoption all right now how does God
[37:24] predestinate by foreknowledge he
[37:27] predestinate all right now so he knew
[37:30] that everybody would not be on the same
[37:33] level
[37:34] right so now here's the point when we
[37:38] get over a little bit in the message
[37:40] I'll back up and repeat it but here's
[37:43] the thought see in the adoption you'll
[37:48] find your new birth you find growth
[37:51] development and then you find the change
[37:53] of the body all using the same word
[37:57] adoption but remember it's in stages you
[38:03] can't put the change of the body up here
[38:06] you've got to grow into the change of
[38:09] the body you case what I said you can't
[38:11] just say well I don't need to work on
[38:13] these other others work on brotherly
[38:14] kindness
[38:15] well now you got a seal in all of these
[38:17] things before your brotherly kindness
[38:20] can be of any affect to you right
[38:23] because I'm the one not the one that
[38:26] said it you're supposed to register to a
[38:27] perfect man maybe they encourage you to
[38:29] read it over and over because he speaks
[38:32] of being birthed into this into this
[38:33] into this he speaks of how the mortar
[38:36] shields us together by the Holy Spirit
[38:38] as it seals in virtue all right see then
[38:41] you got to come into knowledge and
[38:43] knowledge has to be played that it's
[38:45] sealed in like I said then you can jump
[38:49] up and seal in brotherly kindness you
[38:51] gotta wait until you get now he said
[38:54] that's where your chain breaks at the
[38:57] weakest link
[38:59] so if you said well I just get to
[39:00] brotherly kindness I don't need these
[39:02] other look at you weakly standing before
[39:04] you you've done missed a whole thing all
[39:07] right but now let's just look at the
[39:09] Spitzer's cuz we're going to look at the
[39:12] basis that Paul is covering to the
[39:15] Romans all right the three stages of the
[39:21] adoption
[39:22] let me stake this to you then listen
[39:26] adoption then we'll be in stages so we
[39:29] have to go through each stage okay now
[39:33] but adoption is it it's like I'm trying
[39:40] to find a word maybe I'm just reading
[39:42] the scriptures and one but it's
[39:46] adoption is set to work you can have one
[39:51] thing and you could be predestinated to
[39:55] just be born again are you following me
[39:59] coach Paul said your predestinated unto
[40:02] adoption see now we grab a dachshund we
[40:04] throw it way up here we go here we go
[40:06] that would now go easily go to the point
[40:11] of seeing that you're adopted into the
[40:12] family by the new borough all right then
[40:16] go to the manifestation of the sons of
[40:18] dark daughters of God the making known
[40:21] from Romans 8 that will read ensuring
[40:24] that that's another stage of adoption
[40:26] and a lot of people are predestinated to
[40:30] that stage with some that was
[40:34] predestinated and just be born again
[40:35] that's as far as they'll ever go and
[40:37] they'll die in that stage and they'll be
[40:40] with some are predestinated to go to
[40:42] higher greater depth of the word and
[40:45] that's their life but then finally
[40:49] somebody's going to be predestinated to
[40:51] the adoption to wit the redemption of
[40:56] the body so now remember adoption then
[41:01] is going to be in stages three of them
[41:04] want to be your new birth want to be
[41:06] your authority or what you want to call
[41:09] it the next is the change of the body
[41:11] because that's what Paul taught in
[41:13] Romans all right but remember the point
[41:18] you always start that's what I spent a
[41:24] whole message Winston I'd hit it a
[41:27] little bit and I'll come up and then
[41:28] I'll back up the whole message Wednesday
[41:31] was what statue of a perfect man shows
[41:34] you got to be born again and then growth
[41:37] development Paul shows you got to be
[41:41] born into the family adopted into the
[41:44] family and then you start a growth
[41:46] development all right she's showing that
[41:51] they're doing the same thing all right
[41:52] now watch what we're seeing here in
[41:54] Romans and if Christ be in you the body
[41:58] is dead because
[41:59] sin with the Spirit is life because of
[42:02] righteousness God now you need a new
[42:04] birth you need to know you're gonna have
[42:06] to get a bird we'll come on down to it
[42:07] in a minute but it's the spirit now this
[42:10] if the spirit of him that raised up
[42:12] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[42:17] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[42:19] quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit
[42:22] that dwelleth in you a promise this is
[42:25] that your new birth you're being born
[42:29] again it's gonna go all the way to the
[42:31] chains of the body well it's kind of
[42:35] like what I've always said so you say
[42:37] well brother Dale I'd like to get this
[42:39] change this old body cause mine's
[42:40] wearing out all right brother branham
[42:48] how do we get these virtues remember the
[42:52] message message of Malachi 4 luke 1730
[42:56] revelation 10 7 I'm gonna do two things
[42:58] turn the hearts of the children back to
[43:00] the Father reveal the thunders which
[43:01] were revelations hanging in the seventh
[43:02] seal 327 church age book right he told
[43:07] us how to get to that he's told us how
[43:09] to get to the change in the body Paul
[43:11] was telling us how to get to the change
[43:13] of the body but he just couldn't make it
[43:16] manifest right he could come up into the
[43:22] authorities and the manifestations and
[43:24] time but he could not come into the
[43:26] change of the body so he could only
[43:28] prophesy change of the moment in among
[43:31] the twinkling of an eye more to put on
[43:33] immortality he brought it all because
[43:36] that way brother Branham didn't have to
[43:38] come and bring something new he just
[43:40] took us back to what they were saying
[43:42] called Paul is telling us how the body
[43:45] is to be redeemed you want to know how
[43:48] the bodies be redeemed
[43:49] read the Apostle Paul corruptor put on
[43:53] incorruption Morrel put on immortality
[43:58] he's explaining all the way to the
[44:01] change of the body but it was not time
[44:05] for it to happen because it was
[44:09] predestinated for Paul to reach a
[44:12] certain position
[44:13] but then he had to die and go by the
[44:14] grave right
[44:17] remember our predestination is by
[44:21] foreknowledge not God's desire but by
[44:24] foreknowledge that he knows what we will
[44:27] do he knows whether or not you'll accept
[44:29] Jesus Christ as your Savior or whether
[44:31] you'll accept brother so-and-so that
[44:33] said I always was eternal like I've
[44:37] always told you men told us when we were
[44:39] seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:40] one not this brother and the message oh
[44:42] he told us he said there's three of us
[44:45] and it was he said I believe all three
[44:48] of y'all receive the baptism the Holy
[44:49] Ghost will you know those two brothers
[44:51] both of them put their basis of their
[44:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost upon what he
[44:56] said mm-hmm I knew I didn't get it and I
[45:03] didn't put it on it you know what both
[45:06] those brothers is Baxley at this day or
[45:09] whatever you don't call it well you
[45:15] shouldn't be why not it was the truth
[45:17] they put theirs on what he said I put
[45:21] mine up on the word and what God had
[45:24] done and was doing in my life all right
[45:28] so now listen it'll quicken see this new
[45:33] birth that you receive this spirit that
[45:35] raised up Jesus Christ if it comes and
[45:38] dwells in you then he that raised him up
[45:42] will come and quicken even these mortal
[45:44] bodies quick enough to the basis of
[45:47] shocking him to life now like brother
[45:50] George canadough nati like that
[45:52] quickening because that was you know he
[45:54] he had that thought in him you can call
[45:57] it quickening brother George would the
[45:59] spirit would strike him and he he jerk
[46:01] you know because that was that was
[46:03] quickening to him and that's what it
[46:04] means quickening it'll quicken it right
[46:07] now it makes you live right makes you to
[46:09] come to church makes you do the things
[46:11] what justice in your new birth just your
[46:15] new birth is supposed to quicken these
[46:17] bodies but it'll go all the way to the
[46:20] chains okay now therefore brethren we
[46:22] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[46:25] after the flesh
[46:27] for if we live after the flesh you'll
[46:30] die but if you through the spirit do
[46:32] mortify the deeds of the body will live
[46:35] this grow in Christ on for as many as
[46:38] are led by the Spirit of God and look
[46:40] they are the sons of God if you're led
[46:43] by the Spirit of God if you're born
[46:45] again you're a son of God for you have
[46:48] received not the spirit of bondage again
[46:50] to fear but you have received the spirit
[46:52] of adoption that didn't say adoption
[46:58] that didn't it still out the word
[46:59] adoption it's the spirit of adoption so
[47:03] you're gonna start with the spirit of
[47:05] adoption phase one is a new birth spirit
[47:09] of adoption that's that Holy Spirit that
[47:14] comes in you in the new birth that's the
[47:18] spirit of adoption then you can go on to
[47:21] adoption right come on now listen to
[47:26] what he's saying where you have not
[47:28] received the spirit of bondage again to
[47:30] fear which you receive the spirit of
[47:33] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father we
[47:37] have a father when we receive that new
[47:39] birth we have a father he's my father I
[47:42] love that don't you I love to call him
[47:45] father see I never had a father my dad
[47:48] died when I was about four years old so
[47:50] I really never had that point so but I
[47:53] know who my real father is he's my real
[47:56] father okay now look proven this new
[48:04] birth stage-1 proving it look at what
[48:08] Paul says the spirit itself beareth
[48:10] witness with our spirit that we are the
[48:13] children of God what's inside comes
[48:18] outside right now the Spirit of God two
[48:22] enormous shows in the soul that there's
[48:25] something right aren't now listen
[48:26] any children I love this one then heirs
[48:30] heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ
[48:37] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[48:40] may be also glorified together
[48:42] what about errors enjoy our errors is to
[48:48] receive something somebody has that can
[48:51] give it to you as an air of an
[48:53] inheritance or whatever you want to
[48:55] cover it but what about join tires now
[48:59] watch
[49:00] join heirs with Christ well no no no no
[49:05] no no no that that's going this little
[49:07] bit too far now that brother Dale oh now
[49:10] now now back up a little bit how we
[49:12] gonna be join tires with Christ that's
[49:16] what he said that's what he said so
[49:21] that's up to God to prove it to do it
[49:23] somebody's got to be join tires when
[49:26] ours means if you inherit just exactly
[49:28] what Ian heard and you know that Jesus
[49:32] Christ had to inherit eternal life
[49:33] in the play come on wait she's been on
[49:37] that for a long time ago Jesus Christ
[49:40] had to inherit eternal life in flesh
[49:44] because he was not born with eternal
[49:46] life in his flesh so he inherited it
[49:50] where is our inheritance from the father
[49:54] what about inheriting eternal life so
[49:59] somebody's got to die to get that
[50:02] eternal life okay let's go I thought I'd
[50:06] be short today but all right we'll go
[50:08] well I reckon it's the sufferings of
[50:10] this present time are not worthy to be
[50:12] compared with the glory we shall be
[50:14] revealed in us now there's more to come
[50:17] right there's a whole lot more to come
[50:20] now remember what we're doing adoption
[50:22] in stages a stage one is your nuber the
[50:27] spirit of adoption now we're going to
[50:30] read second stage goes into
[50:32] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[50:34] God then we'll go down to where that
[50:37] will cover the change of the body all in
[50:40] Romans wrote about them didn't have to
[50:43] come and give us a new Bible he come to
[50:46] return us back to them there's he faith
[50:49] of the fathers that people do
[50:51] teach I'm going back in the seventies
[50:54] you heard a lot about faith of the
[50:55] fathers and things like that but then
[50:57] adjust all whole we're aware I'll raise
[50:59] what is eternal we're up here we don't
[51:01] need death we don't need that well
[51:05] anything that God has that you don't
[51:10] need I'll be glad to take ok did you
[51:20] listen if you don't want it and it
[51:24] belong to God let me have it
[51:27] cuz I won't everything and I want to be
[51:32] join tires with Jesus Christ he
[51:35] inherited eternal life by coming the way
[51:38] that he I mean in flesh now just covered
[51:41] it by and coming in flesh you know he
[51:44] inherited eternal life in flesh why
[51:47] because he gave up the life he gave all
[51:49] of that to pay the price for me and you
[51:51] well why so we could get eternal life in
[51:54] our soul the new birth and could inherit
[51:58] a right of adoption now did he get a
[52:04] change
[52:05] come on did Jesus Christ get a change of
[52:09] the body his body was made eternal not
[52:14] that it was a sinner no but because it
[52:18] was natural birth it was a physical
[52:21] element it had a beginning so then he
[52:26] had to receive eternal life and that's
[52:28] lesson and he did it the resurrection
[52:30] and the change well I thought that's
[52:32] what we're supposed to do I just want my
[52:36] inheritance right and if you don't want
[52:41] it just let me have it
[52:43] alright okay listen for I reckon then we
[52:52] say oh but we're in trouble and why I
[52:54] will oh wow the new wounds they were
[52:56] brother Forney you know we're so
[52:58] troubled with this and troubled with
[53:00] that if we were Christians
[53:03] have you ever had that toad in your face
[53:05] I've had it throw it in my face people
[53:08] say if we were where we thought we were
[53:11] they'd be more signs and wonders you
[53:14] know what the reason was I was looking
[53:17] at it oh I was looking at the reason
[53:25] that it wasn't happening but I'm nice I
[53:28] don't try to be so arrogant and hateful
[53:30] and say you're the causing it because I
[53:33] know and realize we're all the causing
[53:35] it we just not believe in what God says
[53:43] we're not laying everything upon what he
[53:45] said we're trying to a figure it out and
[53:49] what for the earnest expectation of the
[53:53] creature which is natural creations and
[53:55] ever so in other words the animals and
[53:57] every time right the whole creation
[53:59] whole creatures animals and all is
[54:02] waiting for what waiting for the
[54:05] manifestation of the sons of God now the
[54:09] whole world is waiting animals and all
[54:12] the whole everything waiting on the
[54:14] manifestation of the sons of God have
[54:18] you ever looked at what brother and said
[54:20] manifest means to make no manifest means
[54:27] to make known don't worry about it I've
[54:32] preached this for 40 years I can give it
[54:37] to you by memory but what about all four
[54:38] paragraph 28 adoption 1965 18 with
[54:46] earnest expectation the whole creation
[54:49] is waiting for the manifestation see the
[54:53] manifestation what is manifestation
[54:58] making known
[55:05] making known what are you looking for in
[55:09] adoption brother Dale God to make known
[55:12] his children his sons and daughters
[55:16] because I like it this away cousins we
[55:19] have always appreciated you know what
[55:21] may God honor brother Branham no come on
[55:26] unquote we he said he laid so close to
[55:29] God to make the gift work got a quote
[55:31] come on
[55:32] some of you don't know that's a quote
[55:34] but not I was shaking head yes you know
[55:35] it is
[55:36] he said he laid so close to God till he
[55:38] made to give four you know what he was
[55:40] doing he was making God known why did
[55:44] brother Branham stop letting all
[55:46] louisville preachers get up there and
[55:47] preach and him pray for the sick maybe
[55:56] they wouldn't they brain did exactly the
[55:58] way he wanted the come on him a ride in
[56:02] his early ministry they preached and he
[56:04] done this praying but then he started
[56:07] preaching and a lot of times no praying
[56:13] what was he doing making god known you
[56:19] won't something to happen in your life
[56:20] just make God known and he'll make you
[56:24] known that's what he done with the
[56:29] Prophet the Prophet made him known for
[56:33] the word and God made the Prophet known
[56:36] by signs and wonders because that's what
[56:42] manifest means to be manifestation of
[56:46] the sons of God you know the whole
[56:49] world's waiting on that now that's Ricci
[56:55] Bible the whole world is waiting on the
[56:58] manifestation of sons and daughters have
[56:59] gone you know what I love I've always
[57:03] preached this way and I love it
[57:04] when that bull got up and charged that
[57:07] prophet we were listening the other
[57:09] night this was the thing and he said
[57:13] love come in his heart and he said boy
[57:16] I'm sorry said you go lay down
[57:18] tuku lay down I'm sorry the bull of
[57:23] stopped what about the Hornets what
[57:27] about the things you know that nature
[57:31] met its master for a minute didn't ever
[57:35] think like that for a minute
[57:37] nature made its master that bull just
[57:44] went lay down he walked by him and went
[57:46] on he had made God known that's it right
[57:56] the way he preached he said now I've
[57:57] tried my best to make God known to you
[57:59] so now let's see if God will make known
[58:01] who he is and come with signs and
[58:03] wonders so what is adoption adoption is
[58:08] first what the new birth gives us the
[58:12] new birth brings us into the family of
[58:14] God by the new birth giving us eternal
[58:17] life all right what's the second stage
[58:21] of adoption you can call it authorities
[58:24] and call it manifestations you can call
[58:26] it one because that's what the world's
[58:27] waiting on all right come on read it
[58:29] for the creature was made subject to
[58:32] vanity why because we fail the creature
[58:35] of the creation everything was made
[58:37] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[58:40] reason of him who have subjected the
[58:42] same in Hope because the creature itself
[58:45] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[58:48] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[58:50] of the children of God what do you think
[58:54] there's going to happen when the whole
[58:56] world thing of the animals and
[58:58] everything sees that love of God
[59:08] well that was only for the profit you do
[59:11] what you want what a big man said one
[59:14] time he said at third poles only for
[59:16] brother branham and the Lord Jesus well
[59:18] brother branham said the third pole was
[59:21] for the bride and the sinners never
[59:27] which one what do you second for the it
[59:32] was for the bride and religious people
[59:35] and to the totally lost now that's what
[59:40] he said what you see everybody this
[59:43] world's runner so what so said it well I
[59:45] just believe it you might have to read
[59:47] what brother so-and-so says you might
[59:49] find out they're not reading it okay
[59:52] because the creature itself shall be
[59:54] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[59:56] into the glorious liberty of the
[59:58] children of God now watch for we know
[1:00:01] that the whole creation groaneth and
[1:00:04] travaileth in pain together until now
[1:00:06] why because they're waiting on the
[1:00:09] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[1:00:10] God you just think now I've had this in
[1:00:17] my mind for 40-something years but I'll
[1:00:19] keep it there because it would throw you
[1:00:24] into the wrong channel you realize the
[1:00:29] whole world is waiting on you and me
[1:00:34] that's gonna have to be a certain time
[1:00:36] certain times sure we know it it'll be
[1:00:42] short huh but it'll be there so that's
[1:00:49] as far as I won't say it because that's
[1:00:50] just something that the Lord's always
[1:00:52] showed me and and he brings it back
[1:00:55] every once in a while know this okay cuz
[1:00:58] it's gonna be just a short time look
[1:01:00] don't look for a world wide sweeping
[1:01:02] revival remember you know what we've
[1:01:07] sitting there listening advice not to
[1:01:08] him talking know what I was reading in
[1:01:10] the scripture the reason the prophets
[1:01:12] message you know brother Brennan said
[1:01:14] there would be a said there's a world
[1:01:15] wide sweeping revival going on right now
[1:01:18] he was talking about in his ministry and
[1:01:21] it was this message has went around the
[1:01:25] world but not a world wide sweeping
[1:01:28] revival like they had but it's here and
[1:01:34] it'll manifest itself but look we know
[1:01:38] that the whole creation groaneth and
[1:01:40] travaileth in pain together until now
[1:01:42] waiting on the sons and daughter had
[1:01:44] gone all right now watch it Paul where
[1:01:52] are you at
[1:01:53] Oh where are you at and not only they
[1:02:03] but ourselves also which have the
[1:02:09] firstfruits adoption first age even we
[1:02:16] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[1:02:19] for what waiting for the adoption to wit
[1:02:25] the redemption of our body to wit means
[1:02:29] to understand you've got other meanings
[1:02:34] for the word wit but to wit is to
[1:02:37] understand do you realize then that's
[1:02:44] exactly scripture to understand the
[1:02:49] redemption of the body by somebody
[1:02:51] before it's ever made manifest because
[1:02:57] remember the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:03:02] first and then we which are alive and
[1:03:09] remain shall be changed the last part of
[1:03:14] adoption comes as a change of the body
[1:03:17] alright did you get it did you catch on
[1:03:22] to what I'm saying the whole world
[1:03:27] everything is waiting on the bride of
[1:03:29] Jesus Christ
[1:03:33] they without us Hebrews eleven forty
[1:03:37] cannot be made perfect everything is
[1:03:41] waiting on the bride yeah but where what
[1:03:46] no I saw aren't you waitin whatever you
[1:03:48] want to wait you just do what you want
[1:03:50] to but remember it's waiting on the
[1:03:54] bride to realize who she is and what
[1:03:59] she's here for
[1:04:04] but see that's what I said we go after
[1:04:06] what everybody else has to say about it
[1:04:08] the same brother that made that big
[1:04:11] statement of saying our minute to go
[1:04:12] back to third pool
[1:04:13] he also said he said all these things
[1:04:16] was for Jesus not us and brother branham
[1:04:20] well according to your prophet
[1:04:23] he said the bride would be the final
[1:04:26] voice to the final age unless you take
[1:04:35] what you want to you do what you want to
[1:04:37] because you're going you are anyway the
[1:04:41] bride is to be the final voice to the
[1:04:44] final age so what's the world waiting on
[1:04:48] the bride waiting on the bride to
[1:04:52] realize the redemption is already
[1:04:54] transpired do you realize for you to be
[1:04:57] healed of anything you must first have
[1:05:01] it made known to you that you're healed
[1:05:04] then you must confess that you're healed
[1:05:08] you realize it's the same thing for your
[1:05:10] salvation you must realize that your
[1:05:13] believe it's your saved and then you
[1:05:15] must confess that you're saved for God
[1:05:17] to make it a manifestation so somebody
[1:05:20] is going to stand here and say I'm
[1:05:22] changed and then God can make it
[1:05:28] manifest
[1:05:31] so he's waiting on us in a nod the one
[1:05:38] thing that God is waiting on is the
[1:05:41] bride to find her position of who she is
[1:05:45] and what she's doing so adoption is
[1:05:54] taught in three stages Stage one is your
[1:05:57] new birth that brings you into the body
[1:05:58] makes you co-equal with him in the new
[1:06:05] birth second stage is your manifestation
[1:06:10] of sons and daughters of the Living God
[1:06:14] adoption so I asked you if you'd read
[1:06:18] the messages on adoption if you read
[1:06:23] them or listened to the tapes you'll
[1:06:25] find a lot of things but then the last
[1:06:28] is to know to stand here and understand
[1:06:32] the redemption of the body then God can
[1:06:38] make it manifest right so what are we
[1:06:44] talking about what is their thought
[1:06:48] predestinated unto adoption okay so if
[1:06:58] we believe that adoption is made forth
[1:07:00] in our brought forth in three stages and
[1:07:02] there's people in each one of those
[1:07:04] stages and some will receive the new
[1:07:07] birth and that's as far as they'll go
[1:07:11] because that was where God predestinated
[1:07:14] him because that's where he knew they
[1:07:15] would be able to attain there will be
[1:07:19] some that will reach the manifestation
[1:07:22] of sons and daughters of the Living God
[1:07:24] to where that their name is just as good
[1:07:26] on a checkbook is his name see we're
[1:07:29] getting to that the authorities and that
[1:07:32] all of that and some are predestinated
[1:07:36] to come to that place that's where
[1:07:40] people is always different with me and
[1:07:41] not only I say well you just go ahead
[1:07:44] they said of manifester son can't die I
[1:07:46] said well first off they killed the Lord
[1:07:49] Jesus and I kind of believe he was a
[1:07:50] manifested son but I said all those
[1:07:53] apostles they were manifested for the
[1:07:55] day in the hour they were living in time
[1:07:57] all right
[1:07:58] and all of them died and went by the
[1:08:00] grave I said brother Branham I believe
[1:08:02] he was a manifested son don't you then
[1:08:07] he died went by the grave so it doesn't
[1:08:12] mean anything and that's one that I've
[1:08:13] always tried to tell you that then when
[1:08:16] I said that God showed me that people
[1:08:18] could die and go by the grace I spent no
[1:08:20] time talking about their position their
[1:08:23] position could be a higher than you and
[1:08:26] waiting on you to try to reach a
[1:08:29] position to call them out that's all
[1:08:31] I've ever tried to say why because I
[1:08:35] believe a manifested son and daughter of
[1:08:37] God can go by the grave why because the
[1:08:44] change is for the only part and listen
[1:08:49] the change of the body is the only part
[1:08:54] that is a full collective point in the
[1:08:58] Bride of Christ are you with me
[1:09:05] it ain't gonna be one change here and
[1:09:08] then two weeks later somebody changed
[1:09:10] here months later whatever I don't know
[1:09:13] if the gothy wants to do that but I'm
[1:09:15] just saying it when it comes down to the
[1:09:18] change of the body it's coming more into
[1:09:20] all around the world you said will give
[1:09:23] me scripture to individ want to be taken
[1:09:28] to over here working in the field one
[1:09:32] taken all right we still in the
[1:09:36] scripture all right so then we've got it
[1:09:40] lined up correctly see when the change
[1:09:42] comes it's gonna point more back to a
[1:09:45] group because we're all gonna go meet
[1:09:49] him in the iron as a group
[1:09:53] but your adoptions before them is
[1:09:55] individuals come into their place
[1:09:58] let those individuals reach their place
[1:10:01] the body change will come I'm going to
[1:10:04] drop back because brother branham said
[1:10:08] have faith and be born again he said
[1:10:12] then you take that new birth
[1:10:14] he said that new birth brings faith in
[1:10:17] the soul and he says these virtues will
[1:10:21] be automatically added now he didn't say
[1:10:27] that the way we make automatic we put it
[1:10:31] when while I do nothing is automatically
[1:10:33] added now that wouldn't what he said
[1:10:37] because you've got to cover the
[1:10:40] tutorship and the training and the
[1:10:44] child's got to be willing right then
[1:10:49] they'll be automatically added because
[1:10:50] your church you're not a chicken
[1:10:53] you're a peacock or an eagle it's going
[1:10:58] to be automatically added because you're
[1:11:00] in Christ not just automatically added
[1:11:03] because when I are I don't have to worry
[1:11:04] about anything about America I don't do
[1:11:06] what I want to live like the devil
[1:11:08] that's all gonna be there the Prophet
[1:11:09] said it that wouldn't what he said he
[1:11:12] brings the whole basis of the message
[1:11:14] behind the point of him saying they'd be
[1:11:17] automatically added why because the baby
[1:11:23] just automatically grows up to being an
[1:11:25] adult all this got to do is eat and
[1:11:28] that's all I've ever said about this
[1:11:31] message just eat this message until you
[1:11:35] become the message why not you know but
[1:11:40] I just I just have problems with we're
[1:11:44] trying to read and study why find
[1:11:46] another way
[1:11:47] listen to tapes you can't read listen to
[1:11:49] tapes whatever it takes
[1:11:55] brother got upset at me one time because
[1:11:57] I said you just won't read
[1:12:03] he couldn't read anyone told people I
[1:12:08] was going off on him I went to him I
[1:12:13] said brother get tapes and listen to
[1:12:16] them you don't have to read you can
[1:12:18] listen to tapes and I didn't back down
[1:12:22] and smile I said it turned because I
[1:12:24] knew him I said you can listen to tapes
[1:12:28] ain't you know I'm not talking about
[1:12:31] going off on you cause you can't read
[1:12:33] but that's how easy you can get them
[1:12:35] little bugs then little demons to set on
[1:12:38] your shoulders and think right but you
[1:12:44] understand that hurts what I'm talking
[1:12:46] about there's people that are
[1:12:49] predestinated by God's foreknowledge and
[1:12:52] it's determined by foreknowledge and
[1:12:54] things and they'll only reach a certain
[1:12:56] place when Martin Luther reached the
[1:12:59] place of the just shall live by faith
[1:13:00] there was nowhere for him to go but by
[1:13:02] the grave when John Wesley reached
[1:13:06] predestination of sanctification he
[1:13:09] could not continue it the further he was
[1:13:12] predestinated God saw that was what he
[1:13:15] would attain unto he went by the grave
[1:13:17] are you listening some are predestinated
[1:13:21] to the new birth and that's as far as
[1:13:23] they'll go
[1:13:24] they'll get born again as far as they go
[1:13:27] praise God they're Christians they're
[1:13:29] born to get increases there in the body
[1:13:30] of Christ that's they reached their
[1:13:33] place of predestination with summer
[1:13:35] predestinated to go further now watch
[1:13:38] we've been here 40 or 50 years since the
[1:13:40] prophets go what in child training
[1:13:45] this hasn't been child training for you
[1:13:48] for 40 50 years well then okay you ain't
[1:13:51] been following you tutor because your
[1:13:53] tutor is trying to encourage you to
[1:13:55] understand the word and to study the
[1:13:57] Word of God we should know this message
[1:14:01] so much that those those Pharisees could
[1:14:03] you know those people that claim could
[1:14:04] take a scroll to stick a pin through
[1:14:06] tell you every letter we order not just
[1:14:08] know the letter wielder know the scroll
[1:14:10] next to it and where the pen would go
[1:14:12] why because why hasn't it been that we
[1:14:15] have
[1:14:16] this message come on you know what I
[1:14:28] just said is right the brother Dale I've
[1:14:33] studied I prayed over it that's right
[1:14:34] but you know what you can do more and
[1:14:40] I'm throwing it to me come on it's
[1:14:42] bouncing back you can do more well I put
[1:14:47] forth so much
[1:14:47] well I much effort you put on everything
[1:14:49] else what do you understand what I'm
[1:14:53] saying now to listen some are
[1:14:56] predestinated to receive the new birth
[1:14:58] and that's as far as they'll go and
[1:14:59] they're in the bride across their part
[1:15:01] of the body of Christ
[1:15:02] some are predestinated to come up some
[1:15:04] of these virtues and things coming up on
[1:15:07] to the higher things and coming out and
[1:15:09] you can see them in their lives and
[1:15:11] their predestinated and they go by the
[1:15:13] grave because that's as far as they were
[1:15:17] predestinate but somebody's
[1:15:19] predestinated to stand here and take a
[1:15:20] change that's why Paul says it why read
[1:15:25] Ephesians that we're predestinated unto
[1:15:30] adoption because everybody's not
[1:15:34] predestinated to the same stage but
[1:15:38] there is a stage for all of us to be
[1:15:40] predestinated - somebody's gonna stand
[1:15:44] here and take a change
[1:15:45] come on musicians somebody's gonna take
[1:15:48] a change somebody's predestinated to
[1:15:54] make a change and it still ain't change
[1:15:59] what did the prophets say one day he
[1:16:02] said I doubt a doesn't know what wasn't
[1:16:03] out of this generation now he wasn't
[1:16:06] talking about going to heaven was it he
[1:16:08] would talk about born-again believers in
[1:16:10] Christianity what what he talked about
[1:16:12] I got to be a dozen that'll be changed
[1:16:16] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you
[1:16:19] know what cuz only those that are
[1:16:22] predestinated to that place will reach
[1:16:24] that place
[1:16:26] outside of that and I'm not
[1:16:28] predestinated to that place
[1:16:30] then I'll go by the gray no problem
[1:16:35] that's not decreasing I than anybody
[1:16:37] that goes by the gray it's saying they
[1:16:39] reach their place what are we gonna do
[1:16:41] they reach their place right you say
[1:16:48] yeah but look at all of us we're getting
[1:16:49] older and it's got part to it too but
[1:16:52] there's people who live 100 years old
[1:16:53] now so then sister Cletus he still got a
[1:16:56] few years for she reaches 100 that's
[1:17:02] true I never thought I'd ever be 78
[1:17:08] years old I never thought I'd be 50 I
[1:17:12] mean after coming in this message I
[1:17:14] never thought I'd ever be 50 but you
[1:17:17] don't know what I've enjoyed it you know
[1:17:21] what he gives me 50 more I've enjoyed it
[1:17:27] I've had a good time I've been able to
[1:17:31] read and study about things and see
[1:17:34] things take place that even the Apostles
[1:17:37] and even the prophets desired to look in
[1:17:40] truth and did not see why don't you
[1:17:45] think like that sometimes what a
[1:17:47] wonderful opportunity out of all of this
[1:17:50] world of seven billion people that he
[1:17:53] choose you well if he chose you it must
[1:18:00] have been chosen because the Bible says
[1:18:02] or I turn Ephesians that were chosen in
[1:18:05] him so then it means we were chosen in
[1:18:08] him not chosen of him chosen in him to
[1:18:15] come to predestination of a change of
[1:18:17] these bodies who right on down through
[1:18:22] and feedings worse that unless the
[1:18:24] mystery of his will
