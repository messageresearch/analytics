[0:08] joints
[0:11] even you real owen huh
[0:13] any hearing
[0:26] all right so let's read this as the
[0:27] prophet reads it and you can read it
[0:29] along with me
[0:31] instead of just reading it but we were
[0:33] studying last
[0:34] sunday on
[0:36] the statue of a perfect man beginning at
[0:38] the
[0:39] at the first part where it's not to the
[0:41] world it's not too um
[0:44] just nominal christians this is to the
[0:46] bride this is to the elect this is to
[0:49] the ones
[0:50] hey buddy this is to the ones
[0:53] that are in christ jesus because that's
[0:54] what peter said simon peter and servant
[0:56] apostle jesus christ to them that have
[0:58] obtained
[0:59] like precious faith so what do we got to
[1:01] do before we even start up the statue of
[1:03] a perfect man
[1:05] yeah be born again all right so you got
[1:06] to be born again that's the requirement
[1:09] because you can have some of these
[1:10] virtues and just be
[1:12] as black as soot
[1:14] uh judas
[1:16] had a percentage of these virtues
[1:18] because he was with the twelve but he
[1:20] showed his colors after a while
[1:22] and
[1:24] you know you know what he did so let's
[1:27] read this like the prophet reads it so
[1:28] now
[1:29] let us read now first peter ii peter
[1:31] rather the first chapter of portion of
[1:33] it simon peter servant apostle jesus
[1:35] christ to them that have obtained
[1:37] like precious faith with us through the
[1:40] righteousness of god in our savior jesus
[1:42] christ i like the way that stated right
[1:44] there because my whole subject this
[1:46] morning is based on faith that's what
[1:48] we're talking about faith is the biggest
[1:50] part of the pyramid it's the foundation
[1:52] that we start with
[1:54] right i like the way that stated see let
[1:57] me read that again listen close simon
[1:58] peter servant apostle jesus christ to
[2:00] them that obtain obtain black precious
[2:03] faith through the righteousness of god
[2:05] our savior in jesus christ notice he is
[2:07] saying that i have obtained this faith
[2:10] am i and i am addressing this to them
[2:12] that have obtained the like precious
[2:14] faith all right so he's talking to
[2:15] certain good people he's not talking to
[2:17] sinners he's talking to a group of
[2:19] people
[2:20] all right called the bride
[2:22] okay
[2:24] i have obtained this faith and i'm
[2:25] addressing this to them that has
[2:27] obtained like precious faith i want it's
[2:29] not to the outside world
[2:33] all right not to the outside world this
[2:35] is to the church see
[2:36] those that are in christ
[2:39] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[2:41] through the knowledge of god and through
[2:43] of jesus christ our lord and i'm reading
[2:45] it like he's reading it for anybody's on
[2:46] the internet that can't see that
[2:48] i'm reading it as the prophet's reading
[2:50] it not as as totally as the bible but i
[2:53] want to get his comments in there
[2:56] grace and peace be multiplying to you
[2:57] through the knowledge of god and through
[2:59] of jesus christ our lord according
[3:02] as his divine power has given unto us
[3:04] all things his divine power now has
[3:06] given unto us all things that pertain to
[3:08] life
[3:08] godliness to the knowledge of him that's
[3:10] called us to glory and virtue
[3:12] whereby we are given unto given unto us
[3:15] exceeding great and precious promises
[3:17] that by these
[3:18] what these promises
[3:20] we might be partakers of the divine
[3:22] nature
[3:23] now let that soak in real deep now not
[3:25] preaching this morning we're just
[3:26] teaching this lesson divine nature
[3:29] let me read that fourth verse again so
[3:31] you won't miss it whereby we are given
[3:33] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[3:35] great and precious promises that by
[3:37] these these promises we might be
[3:39] partakers of the divine nature having
[3:40] escaped the corruption
[3:42] that is in the world through lust see
[3:44] there's a promise you've escaped the
[3:47] world
[3:49] the lust of the world
[3:50] and that's exactly what we're going to
[3:52] be looking at
[3:53] we don't like to call it that just like
[3:55] the other day we didn't like to call
[3:57] things and time but remember this is
[3:59] antichrist
[4:01] sorry this was born against christ this
[4:03] is not the way christ wanted this to
[4:05] come
[4:06] so it's anti it's anti-word we were not
[4:08] born according to the word
[4:11] jesus was born according to the word
[4:12] that's why he was who he was
[4:14] we were not born according to the word
[4:16] we were born anti-word all right and we
[4:18] have to be
[4:20] that's why we have to escape this we
[4:22] have a way of escape
[4:24] let's don't leave it hanging that we're
[4:25] anti-word and will always be anti-word
[4:27] no there's a way back
[4:29] there's a way to get out of that all
[4:31] right and it's true that we escape the
[4:34] world through the lust of the world as
[4:36] the bible says well this that's what's
[4:37] happening here you you still got you've
[4:40] got faith at the new birth
[4:42] all right
[4:43] and then it says add to your faith in
[4:45] other words what i said the other day
[4:47] add to what you believe
[4:49] because you can't add to something you
[4:50] don't believe in
[4:51] right you gotta you gotta come to faith
[4:53] that's why brother brown said this whole
[4:55] thing is based on faith
[4:57] you've got to believe that god's going
[4:59] to do that for you
[5:00] you got to believe that he's made a way
[5:02] to do that for you
[5:04] okay
[5:05] and he's made the way because remember
[5:07] and we were talking a little bit in the
[5:08] minister's meeting yesterday
[5:11] that
[5:13] ephesians 1 says we've obtained an
[5:15] inheritance
[5:17] well we didn't get an inheritance down
[5:19] here
[5:20] we got our inheritance before the
[5:21] foundation of the world if we believe
[5:23] that we're predestinated jesus come to
[5:25] make a way for us to get out of this
[5:27] anti right word yes birth yes to be born
[5:32] again
[5:34] not of corruptible seed which is what
[5:36] your mom and daddy brought sorry
[5:38] corruptable can't be god that's right
[5:40] all right so we were born in corruption
[5:42] but we're going to be raised in
[5:44] incorruption or be changed and we're not
[5:46] going to be changed unless we have all
[5:48] these virtues working in our life plus
[5:50] the headstone or the seals coming to
[5:53] show us that this guy right here is
[5:55] righteous
[5:58] what are you if you're born again
[6:00] you're god in human flesh that's right
[6:02] but you got to believe that your mind's
[6:04] got to be changed to the mind of christ
[6:10] because you are god man manifest in
[6:11] another form if you have the new birth
[6:13] you're god in him flesh
[6:15] so it's not that god's got a problem
[6:16] living in human flesh he does not
[6:20] the problem is is us
[6:22] that's right
[6:23] he's perfect trying to work on something
[6:25] in person right and he's not trying he
[6:27] is that's right he is working on and
[6:29] that's what the whole song he's still
[6:31] working on me
[6:32] to make me what i
[6:34] ought to be okay but we got to realize
[6:36] that we just don't come into the message
[6:38] and then we just get born again and then
[6:40] we just sit there
[6:43] yeah you're born into the kingdom but
[6:45] you're just like the prodigal son
[6:47] remember the prodigal son wasn't
[6:50] a bastard child
[6:53] he was a
[6:54] son
[6:56] he wasn't lost
[6:58] come on now he wasn't he was a son
[7:02] he backslid
[7:04] went away from the promise of god or the
[7:06] promise of his father
[7:08] right but he was a son
[7:10] and because he was a son he come back
[7:13] because god called him back we see
[7:15] that's an allegory or a
[7:17] a type so so let's see that that even as
[7:20] born-again christians we do things wrong
[7:22] we we we do live in a world of of lust
[7:26] of this thing and lust of that thing
[7:28] doesn't have to be just lust of what
[7:29] first thing comes to your mind
[7:32] but we can have lust for other things
[7:33] and god wants to cut that away because
[7:36] we do we live
[7:38] in this earthly flesh
[7:40] and it's always going to be earthy
[7:42] until we're changed or as we were
[7:45] preaching the other day about the
[7:46] purging you're either going to be purged
[7:47] too one or two ways you're going to die
[7:51] and resurrect
[7:53] and that purges you from your old man
[7:56] right
[7:57] or you're going to be changed in the
[7:58] moment in 2011
[8:00] on this side
[8:01] but this is going to change this thing
[8:03] before it goes
[8:06] like brother branham always says and
[8:08] claude brought her to my attention long
[8:09] time ago now it's always stuck with me
[8:12] because he said this thing is going to
[8:13] be sticky right to the change and it is
[8:14] you're going to have to fight this thing
[8:15] right here
[8:17] i was
[8:18] sister tudy gave me a book
[8:20] on the
[8:22] journey of israel how israel got started
[8:24] way back i'm talking about way back and
[8:25] even in david's time well he breaks down
[8:28] david's era and it's and it's true
[8:32] because of what david did
[8:35] god said you'll fight your way so for 40
[8:38] years david fought
[8:40] battle after battle but now he was
[8:43] victorious
[8:44] but he still had to fight now watch
[8:46] joshua the first time he gets into the
[8:48] kingdom god said here's your promised
[8:49] land it's flowing with milk and honey
[8:51] what's the first thing you've done you
[8:52] have to start fighting people so this is
[8:54] a battle the bible says that the kingdom
[8:56] is is is obtained by force
[8:59] we have to obtain this by force not just
[9:01] get born again and say that's it no once
[9:03] you get born again you just are able to
[9:05] begin to fight
[9:06] there's no fight when you're not born
[9:08] again
[9:09] remember there was no white dog black
[9:11] dog when when the black dog was one it
[9:12] was ruined
[9:15] but once you get the two in there right
[9:18] they're fighting back and forth
[9:20] and which one we feed the most that's
[9:22] the one that wins right
[9:24] but we have a way out that's right we
[9:26] have a way of escape we have a way to
[9:28] get out of all this all right but it's
[9:30] going up the statue of perfect man it's
[9:31] not just saying i'm in the message and i
[9:33] sit in a message church you said they're
[9:35] all you can sit in the church for 30
[9:37] years 40 years 50 years 100 years and
[9:39] still don't go to heaven that's right
[9:42] or are you going to die and go by the
[9:43] grave
[9:44] and somebody's going to have to
[9:45] resurrect you but somebody's going to
[9:47] come and you say well i can't do this
[9:49] well you just stopped yourself
[9:52] if you say i can't do it then you might
[9:53] as well just quit because you can't
[9:55] but you just got to keep struggling keep
[9:57] fighting like like that like i said
[9:58] about david and i believe that's why
[10:01] that
[10:02] that the member of the bible promises
[10:04] that in the millennium
[10:06] that the son of david was set on the
[10:08] throne
[10:09] for solomon was the son of david he was
[10:11] prosperous he didn't fight wars
[10:13] that all was done by his daddy to
[10:15] acquire all this
[10:17] land and not he had to fight all these
[10:18] people
[10:20] and even in that book did you read that
[10:21] book where he said even that david
[10:24] now remember he killed goliath which was
[10:26] a philistine and they almost wiped that
[10:29] army out but you see him about 10 years
[10:31] later the philistines are helping him
[10:33] get back into into judea
[10:35] so he he was a real he was a diplomat
[10:39] he could get you to do things and that
[10:41] was the anointing that david had he had
[10:42] that anointing he could get people the
[10:44] people that he destroyed he got him to
[10:46] help him
[10:47] but see that's what david was he was the
[10:48] type of christ and that's the same way
[10:51] um
[10:52] but that's why he got a promise that in
[10:53] the millennium the son of david is going
[10:55] to sit on the throne ruling peacefully
[10:57] for a thousand years okay it's not gonna
[11:00] be david sitting there but it's the type
[11:03] showing that david fought for every inch
[11:05] you and i are gonna fight right up to
[11:07] the time we get out of here but once we
[11:09] get in the millennium we'll see it's not
[11:11] the millennium's not even to us it's to
[11:14] the jews
[11:16] because we're going to sit with him in
[11:18] the temple and rule
[11:20] for a thousand years
[11:21] right we're going to be the queen he's
[11:23] the king
[11:24] the jews are good at 144 000 is going to
[11:26] be the units the temple eunuch and then
[11:28] there's going to be tribes
[11:30] remember dad preaching on this there's
[11:31] tribes going to be out there in the
[11:32] millennium it's not just going to be us
[11:34] because it is to israel
[11:37] the millennium is the israel we're just
[11:38] there on a honeymoon
[11:40] and i found out something about since
[11:42] we're starting to
[11:43] to uh have honeybees you know where the
[11:46] warren honeymoon came from
[11:48] where did the word honeymoon come from
[11:51] thank you sister
[11:57] ginger you see what i have to put up
[11:58] with
[12:00] i know
[12:01] but anyway yeah y'all put up with it too
[12:03] i'm sure
[12:05] the word honeymoon has nothing to do
[12:08] with your honey
[12:10] sorry
[12:11] honeymoon
[12:13] back in the like the whatever century it
[12:15] was
[12:17] before that it was just the consummation
[12:20] of the wedding it was the honeymoon it
[12:22] wasn't called honeymoon
[12:24] so back a couple of thousand years ago
[12:26] this was before even christ they would
[12:27] take honey
[12:29] and ferment it
[12:30] and make mead
[12:32] liquor wine
[12:34] make honey wine and you can make honey
[12:36] wine they told us if it was too much if
[12:38] it was too much moisture that would turn
[12:39] into wine and you'd have honey wine
[12:41] so they would make honey wine honey wine
[12:45] in the olden days and they would give it
[12:47] to the
[12:48] husband and wife when they got married
[12:50] and they would drink it for a month
[12:53] from one moon to the other
[12:56] moon
[12:59] for conception purposes
[13:01] and it helped them have a boy and not a
[13:04] girl
[13:05] therefore it was called
[13:07] a honey moon
[13:10] there's where the word honeymoon comes
[13:11] from
[13:12] so
[13:13] see there
[13:14] you learned something today you might
[13:16] not learn another thing about the statue
[13:17] of a furby man but you sure know
[13:23] education class last sunday so we might
[13:25] as well end it up with a honeymoon
[13:29] there's a lot of things you can do with
[13:30] honey
[13:42] no let's talk about the uh
[13:44] the world we've escaped the world now
[13:45] look what brother brown says in
[13:46] paragraph 37
[13:48] see the world we've escaped that now
[13:50] he's addressing this to the church
[13:53] that's why we're here this morning is to
[13:55] find out what is the way
[13:57] what is god's requirement so this is a
[13:59] requirement
[14:00] these virtues are a requirement it's not
[14:02] something that just fills up space in
[14:04] the bible
[14:06] but realize one thing for sure
[14:08] we're in the end time with the fullness
[14:10] of the word they didn't have the
[14:11] fullness of the word in the first church
[14:13] age but they had all these virtues the
[14:15] prophet said working in their life
[14:18] see how short we are yeah see women want
[14:21] to be real revelation get all the seals
[14:23] and everything but we can't live a good
[14:24] christian life
[14:27] do the right things
[14:29] say the right thing be the right example
[14:31] they were the right example
[14:33] and then god could seal it with that
[14:36] holy spirit up here not not the holy
[14:38] ghost you receive down here it's not two
[14:40] different holy ghosts but it's more
[14:43] we'll get to later on where brother
[14:44] brown said that holy spirit up there on
[14:45] the top of that pyramid
[14:47] it
[14:48] seals
[14:50] all these virtues in
[14:51] because see you can have the new birth
[14:53] here and go all the way up here
[14:55] and not make it
[14:56] to
[14:58] say patience
[15:00] or temperance well that's as far as you
[15:02] go
[15:03] as far as you go
[15:06] but you're not going to reach perfection
[15:08] that's right okay yeah you're there is
[15:11] perfection you got to go
[15:12] that's why i said look it says it's not
[15:15] man's requirement it's not the prophet's
[15:17] requirement it says what is god's
[15:18] requirement
[15:19] so it's required that these virtues work
[15:21] in our life all right
[15:23] that's why the ephesian church was a
[15:25] powerful church a huge
[15:27] huge church 12 people
[15:31] there was 12 people in a room
[15:34] and they were a powerful church why they
[15:36] had all the virtues working in their
[15:37] life
[15:38] were they sticky until they died surely
[15:40] they were sure they were
[15:42] yeah they were sticking up but they
[15:44] weren't as sticky as they used to be no
[15:46] that's the best thing to say is you're
[15:48] not as sticky as you used to be
[15:50] okay
[15:51] but
[15:52] these are requirements everybody
[15:53] understand these are required they're
[15:55] not just something we're going through
[15:56] just to be going through for the 25th
[15:58] time
[16:00] it says this what is god's requirement
[16:02] there's not a person in here that loves
[16:03] god but wants to become more like christ
[16:06] now it's laid out here every christian
[16:09] i'm an old veteran look at brother and
[16:11] sister kid here they're probably the
[16:12] oldest in the building if i'd ask them
[16:14] what is your heart's desire
[16:16] it'd be closer to god
[16:18] when you learn of christ there's
[16:20] something about him that's so loving
[16:22] you just try to get right into him and
[16:24] then he expresses that by his wife
[16:26] saying that he loved her so much he
[16:27] wanted to just pull her inside of him
[16:30] but you can't do that
[16:33] but christ can do it to us he can be
[16:36] that husband
[16:38] that loves his wife so much and he does
[16:40] and he does protect us from the world
[16:42] let's feed this right here i want to
[16:43] read this
[16:50] right here very good 45.
[16:54] that's the way it is with christ see
[16:56] we've got to be so in love with him to
[16:58] when we ask for something and he doesn't
[17:00] give it to us
[17:01] that doesn't shake us a bit so as we go
[17:04] through this study say god i want virtue
[17:07] i won't verse you i won't verse you and
[17:08] then you're still the same
[17:10] we're gonna do quit and say god why are
[17:12] you no you just keep going you just keep
[17:14] going keep going
[17:16] when he says no in other words like i
[17:18] told you god's nose are the best guesses
[17:20] you'll ever get
[17:21] because you may be wanting to obtain
[17:23] virtue this way just use it for an
[17:25] example you may be wanting to find say
[17:27] well god i need virtue so i'm going to
[17:29] do this
[17:31] but god's way's over here
[17:33] and you're over here beating your head
[17:34] against the wall god's saying no that's
[17:36] not right
[17:37] so
[17:39] try something else
[17:41] he said that's so simple well brother
[17:43] branham said if you were stingy what'd
[17:44] he say
[17:46] give money away
[17:47] if you were stubborn
[17:50] start giving stuff what he said do the
[17:52] vice versa so if you're
[17:54] if you're if you're mean and if you're
[17:56] mean to your wife or if you're mean to
[17:58] your husband
[17:59] that's wrong
[18:01] quit doing that
[18:03] just quit doing it
[18:04] do the vice versa
[18:07] quit being mean to each other and i'm
[18:08] talking about meaning about having
[18:10] fusses and fights and arguments i'm
[18:11] talking about being just mean to people
[18:13] you just being mean ain't got nothing to
[18:14] do with this statue of a perfect man
[18:17] it really doesn't have anything to do
[18:18] with the lord just don't be mean don't
[18:20] be spiteful we already went through all
[18:22] that but look
[18:23] see why and the only way we can do that
[18:25] is become partakers of his divine nature
[18:28] so the only way we're going to ever get
[18:29] right is to be born again
[18:32] the only way we're ever going to get
[18:33] right is to be born again
[18:37] then you'll understand the reason he
[18:39] can't give it to you partakers of his
[18:40] divine nature and look here having
[18:42] escaped the corruption that is in the
[18:43] world through lust
[18:45] escaped it see who it's to is to the
[18:47] church
[18:49] them who are in christ has been exalted
[18:51] above these things
[18:54] not he exalting himself
[18:58] because you're going to try your best to
[19:00] get up here and then one day you're
[19:01] going to fall but if he takes you up
[19:03] there that's right and like we were
[19:05] talking about in the sunday school class
[19:06] it's a birth
[19:08] virtue is a birth because it's something
[19:10] you're contrary to
[19:14] you're contrary you contrary to all
[19:15] these virtues or you wouldn't need them
[19:17] right okay you're contrary to them so
[19:19] you're contrary to them you need these
[19:21] virtues so god's going to help you
[19:23] through them but you can't do it
[19:25] yourself
[19:26] and it be godly
[19:29] you can try your best
[19:32] but still
[19:33] somewhere down the line it's like daddy
[19:35] was talking about you know the example
[19:36] of talking about
[19:37] somebody slapping him said he don't
[19:39] think he could ever take anybody
[19:40] slapping him well somebody at general
[19:42] motors 20 something years ago slapped
[19:43] him
[19:44] and he saw it was gone he that the anger
[19:47] didn't raise up the
[19:49] you know i'm gonna hit you back or i'm
[19:50] gonna get you back no it was gone so
[19:52] once it's gone then you say thank you
[19:54] god and you can lock that in and you can
[19:56] have what faith
[19:57] you don't stop having faith down here
[19:59] right now remember
[20:02] one more time these lines are just lines
[20:05] of separating each word
[20:08] actually there's no line
[20:12] this is the way it ought to be right
[20:13] here
[20:18] and right faith right virtue and all
[20:20] these temperaments patience god in this
[20:22] brother kindness because you're going to
[20:23] need it all the way up
[20:25] and you're going to get a percentage of
[20:27] of brotherly kindness because you know
[20:29] what when you get born again you're
[20:30] going to start loving the people that
[20:32] love you first that's right all right
[20:35] then you've got to start loving the
[20:36] people that don't love you
[20:39] right that's the development is to love
[20:41] the people that don't even like you at
[20:43] all there are even people you don't want
[20:44] to be around yeah yeah
[20:46] all right so same thing with knowledge
[20:49] god when he burst you into the body of
[20:51] christ the first thing god started doing
[20:54] for me was he started putting the word
[20:55] together i heard the words when i was 14
[20:57] years old in this church is that here
[20:59] god was 14 15 16 17 18 years old
[21:04] i read the books listened to the tapes
[21:06] knew what the prophet said
[21:08] i knew the white horse writer was the
[21:10] antichrist but you know why that
[21:11] antichrist was right here
[21:13] he had not ridden away from
[21:16] my revelation because i didn't have one
[21:18] all i had was was the ability to read
[21:22] and i think that's our problem we just
[21:24] get the ability to read
[21:27] come on that's right are we still doing
[21:29] here for 50 years
[21:31] the prophet brought the pure word of god
[21:33] why are we still here
[21:34] because we're just reading it like a
[21:36] reading room right
[21:37] and then like brother brown said he said
[21:39] you don't need a revelation to see
[21:41] what baptism in the name of jesus christ
[21:43] it's right there playing in the book but
[21:45] it does take a revelation to see it to
[21:47] really see it that's right so when i
[21:49] came back to the lord the first thing
[21:50] the lord started doing was was
[21:52] quickening what i had heard is that what
[21:54] the bible says
[21:56] quicken what you heard and teach you
[21:58] things to come
[22:00] in other words revelation
[22:02] he taught me revelation he taught me the
[22:04] serpent seed wasn't just sex in the
[22:06] garden he'd come all the way from the
[22:07] mind of eve all the way down to here and
[22:09] then we got to go back
[22:12] to destroy that
[22:13] okay of course not just that he didn't
[22:16] eat an apple
[22:17] see i think we use that a lot of times
[22:19] when we go we know something you don't
[22:20] know
[22:22] well that's not right
[22:23] to be that way
[22:25] because it says right here not he
[22:26] exalted himself
[22:29] but christ brought him up
[22:32] all right everybody got that christ has
[22:34] got to do it so it's not just not what
[22:36] you do
[22:38] you say well you just told us to do the
[22:39] vice versa that's for you to start with
[22:42] you got to start somewhere
[22:44] if you're stubborn and continue to be
[22:45] stubborn god can't deal with you but if
[22:48] you say god i'm tired of being stubborn
[22:51] i'm tired of being stubborn
[22:53] then he can start working on you we'll
[22:54] just turn around and quit being stubborn
[22:56] for a little while try it yourself
[22:58] this is not this is not reformation
[23:01] this is not alcohol it's anonymous
[23:03] where they suppress your feelings so
[23:05] that you're once an alcoholic always an
[23:07] alcoholic no
[23:08] you get born again all that goes away
[23:10] right all right
[23:12] truly born again right all that'll go
[23:14] away now you know i said truly born
[23:16] again all right
[23:18] now let's read right here
[23:24] look at paragraph 49
[23:26] now remember this was the old color
[23:27] sister says i ain't what i want to be
[23:29] ain't what i ought to be ain't what i
[23:31] want to be but ain't what it used to be
[23:32] like what brother ryan says that's how
[23:34] we know we pass from death into life see
[23:36] we've got to know that church we can sit
[23:38] here and we can go through this and it's
[23:40] just a good sunday school class
[23:43] and it'll give you a feel good if you
[23:44] want to and it'll condemn you if you
[23:46] want to but you got to be
[23:49] you gotta pass from death unto life to
[23:50] even start understanding all right
[23:53] we look back to the pit where we was
[23:55] huge from see we're not what we want to
[23:58] be
[23:59] we're not even what we ought to be
[24:01] but one thing we're thankful for we're
[24:04] not what we used to be
[24:06] that's right he says look we're on the
[24:08] road
[24:09] haven't made it yet but we are on the
[24:11] right road like daddy said remember if
[24:14] we got a ticket to get on the bus
[24:16] and we go to the airport
[24:18] that ticket doesn't do you any good
[24:20] unless you're standing where the bus is
[24:21] going to be that's right right so we got
[24:23] to be where the bus is going to be
[24:27] listen and having escaped the corruption
[24:28] of the world having escaped that the
[24:30] lust and corruption of the world you're
[24:32] above that now that's now that's the
[24:34] type of person that he's talking to the
[24:36] person that has escaped these things see
[24:39] the corruption of the world and besides
[24:41] this giving all diligence
[24:43] add unto your faith virtue and to virtue
[24:45] knowledge and knowledge temperance
[24:47] tempers patience peace of god and this
[24:48] godless brother carlos brotherly
[24:50] kindness
[24:52] charity
[24:53] it says now he has given us the outline
[24:55] here what to do know how to do it
[24:58] now as i said we're all trying to come
[25:00] closer to god that's why i chose this
[25:01] message this morning for the church
[25:03] knowing that people are traveling but
[25:05] last night i said how many is here and
[25:07] he's talking about from out of town
[25:08] people
[25:09] but there's no great anthem some
[25:10] pretended to be angelic choir some
[25:12] stained glass you have a hard time
[25:14] getting a seat on a bench
[25:16] and standing around the wall they don't
[25:17] come for such as that but they come
[25:19] because the inside of them
[25:21] is something that sees a beauty that's a
[25:23] natural eye doesn't see
[25:25] it's a spiritual eye that catches the
[25:26] beauty of christ that's why
[25:29] they're here and that's why we're here
[25:32] that's why we're here we're here to
[25:34] learn about god learn about what he's
[25:36] done for us
[25:38] and he even talks about here about how
[25:40] this came you come back two times two
[25:42] equal four but but look what he says in
[25:44] paragraph 54. here's the key right here
[25:47] yield yourself
[25:50] and after a while you'll break away from
[25:51] yourself you say oh that's for a profit
[25:54] is it
[25:57] how many times do we truly yield
[25:58] ourselves to god
[26:01] come on how many times do we just say
[26:03] god
[26:04] i'm in a i'm in a corner
[26:08] i'm sure some of you have i mean i'm
[26:10] sure but we haven't as much as we should
[26:12] no that's right
[26:14] we should yield right you say well this
[26:15] is layout of sin we got all this and we
[26:17] got all that and it's true we got all
[26:18] these
[26:19] we got all these things now that's uh
[26:21] conveniences and we still can't find
[26:23] time to serve god
[26:25] um
[26:26] johnny charles wesley's mother 17
[26:28] children
[26:29] could you imagine washing clothes for 17
[26:32] kids
[26:33] and she spent two hours a day teaching
[26:35] them about god
[26:37] two hours a day
[26:38] no we have to do this and we go do that
[26:40] and i can name
[26:42] i can put it on a list but you know what
[26:43] you got your own list
[26:45] you should know whether you're not doing
[26:47] right that's what we were talking about
[26:48] last night or yesterday in the
[26:50] in the uh ministers meeting we were
[26:52] talking about the three comings of of
[26:54] god in the end time
[26:56] but we truly got to realize that god has
[26:58] come in the end time and he's he's here
[27:00] to deal with the things that
[27:02] he didn't leave us in lao to see and say
[27:04] wow you all just do what the best you
[27:05] can you know no he told some of the
[27:07] other ages do the best you can remember
[27:09] he told them in the fourth age
[27:11] you got just a little bit of light
[27:13] you're barely just going to barely make
[27:14] it
[27:15] why they were killed remember 68 million
[27:18] christians were killed during the dark
[27:19] ages of the time of
[27:21] of columba there in thyatira church age
[27:24] they could just barely make it through
[27:26] just say you're a christian they'll kill
[27:27] you
[27:28] they didn't have to worry with virtue
[27:31] knowledge temperance patience sure they
[27:33] had those things working in their life
[27:36] but they were required
[27:38] for their age but this age is required
[27:42] statue of a perfect man and onto the
[27:44] headstone because here's the real
[27:45] message of the hour so everything's got
[27:47] to be moving up toward that
[27:49] is to the headstone
[27:53] brother brown didn't come bring us
[27:54] another message or another god
[27:57] he restored the faith remember
[28:02] faith of the father's to the children
[28:03] right
[28:05] but he's restoring the what faith
[28:08] what we lost faith in the word
[28:10] you go talk to somebody in the baptist
[28:12] church or methodist church and all
[28:13] places like that talk to them and see
[28:15] what kind of hope they have well i hope
[28:17] i'm safe well i hope we're going to make
[28:18] it well i hope this president's going to
[28:20] do this i hope the pope's going to do it
[28:22] it's all a hope that we're just we're
[28:23] just hoping they have no road map
[28:25] brother brown said you got a road map
[28:27] you're on the road now
[28:29] so we got to get on the right road
[28:31] and it's like a brother was saying last
[28:33] night this is kind of a cooling off time
[28:34] you don't hear many people getting saved
[28:36] you don't hear many people getting
[28:37] baptized i mean it's a big thing to hear
[28:39] one person getting baptized in this
[28:40] church
[28:42] where we used to baptize five or six
[28:44] when i first started coming in 98 99 in
[28:46] there
[28:47] i was one of them but now we baptize
[28:49] maybe one or two maybe three a year
[28:53] right
[28:54] it's a cooling off time everything's
[28:56] kind of cooled off but even during that
[28:58] cooling off time let's go back to the
[29:00] honeybees
[29:02] in the wintertime they're worthless they
[29:03] don't produce anything
[29:06] but they're getting that hive ready for
[29:08] the spring they're inside working
[29:10] they're not they're not relaxing
[29:13] they're in there working you can't see a
[29:14] lot of activity going on because it's
[29:16] inside
[29:17] am i making a point here
[29:20] you don't see a lot going on but on the
[29:21] inside something's working then all of a
[29:23] sudden when the environment is right
[29:27] they've got the comb ready they've got
[29:29] the
[29:30] little bitty worker bees that are in
[29:32] their little larvas and when they hatch
[29:34] they go to work
[29:36] and all the worker bees are
[29:38] women that's right praise the lord your
[29:41] sister say hallelujah
[29:43] and i'm not going to tell you what she
[29:44] does to the male bee when she gets
[29:46] finished with him so it's
[29:48] kind of not good for the men
[29:52] let's just put it this way he dies
[29:57] i may expound on yielding yourself and i
[29:59] stand to be corrected you know that but
[30:02] we have to yield ourselves but we have
[30:04] to grow with our yields that's correct
[30:06] you can't just say i'm going to yield
[30:08] myself right no you have to grow every
[30:10] day you have to grow you know eat women
[30:12] for me example i'm yielding myself more
[30:14] and more i'll give them a whole day
[30:16] whatever you have to do if you have to
[30:17] do laundry don't bring the cell phone
[30:19] right
[30:20] think about him when you're doing your
[30:22] laundry think about him when you're
[30:23] doing your cooking your healing should
[30:25] be growing insane
[30:27] yeah and that's a good point because
[30:29] look
[30:30] there are nuns nuns in uns nuns in
[30:33] convents now are you talking about
[30:35] yielding yourself
[30:41] and they're just as black as said inside
[30:42] yeah they're not born again
[30:45] if they take that catholic doctrine but
[30:47] they yield themselves
[30:48] to that idea
[30:51] that the catholic church is going to
[30:53] save them because of the penance they do
[30:55] that's why martin luther was so
[30:56] important he said it's not that it's not
[30:59] works
[31:00] it's faith the just shall live by
[31:04] faith
[31:06] right there foundation the just shall
[31:08] live by faith that's put that put luther
[31:11] in the body of christ now he didn't have
[31:13] to work on virtue knowledge tempers
[31:14] patience sure god worked on him in a
[31:16] degree but he still sat in a pub and
[31:18] drank beer and smoked a pipe he didn't
[31:20] see that the other things of god were
[31:23] were to clean up your life
[31:25] he just said the just shall live by
[31:27] faith and that's exactly what happened
[31:29] during that time the just lived by what
[31:32] the faith of god not the faith in the
[31:34] catholic church or the faith in the
[31:35] penance because martin luther himself
[31:37] would drag himself across rocks
[31:40] lay prostate for hours praying with his
[31:43] face in a rock
[31:45] what trying to do penance
[31:47] then when that revelation came he didn't
[31:48] do that no more
[31:51] he gets up cleans himself off
[31:53] and yeah he does go to a pub and start
[31:55] drinking beer and smoking a cigar and
[31:57] talking about god but it was the just
[31:59] shall live by faith
[32:01] come out of that system of course he was
[32:03] a reformer not a restorer he began the
[32:07] act of restoration but he was a reformer
[32:09] so he could just reform him to a certain
[32:11] spot
[32:12] okay
[32:13] wesley could reform to a certain spot
[32:16] right but then we come with the full
[32:17] restoration of the word and it's
[32:19] restored it back
[32:21] restore back to the faith of the fathers
[32:23] all right and then go on to the
[32:25] headstone because it's required in this
[32:27] age so these are not just something we
[32:29] want to do it's something we are
[32:31] required to do
[32:32] all right
[32:34] so now
[32:36] one more thing before we go now let's
[32:38] just stop right there
[32:39] we'll read something else next week
[32:43] if you got the statue of a perfect man
[32:45] book or if you can look at it online
[32:46] like this
[32:47] read what he says about faith but that's
[32:50] what we're going to start on next sunday
[32:52] is faith
