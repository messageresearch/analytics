[43:53] rotten seed so it's it's all about God
[43:55] he has to to bring it to fruition he has
[43:57] to do it it's it's a three-fold purpose
[44:01] amen I love that we begin reading it
[44:04] verse one 2 Corinthians chapter 3 says
[44:08] Do We Begin Again to commend
[44:11] ourselves or do we as some other others
[44:16] Epistles of commendation to you to
[44:19] letters of commendation from you it says
[44:22] ye are our epistle written in in our
[44:26] hearts known and read of all men for as
[44:30] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[44:34] Epistle of Christ ministered by us not
[44:37] written with ink but with the spirit of
[44:40] the Living God not in tables of stone
[44:44] but in fleshly tables of the heart and
[44:48] such trust have we through Christ to
[44:54] godward not not that we are sufficient
[44:58] of ourselves to think anything of other
[45:01] of ourselves but our
[45:04] sufficiency is of
[45:08] God I like that Paul is telling look I
[45:11] don't have no sufficiency in myself I I
[45:14] don't need commendations of any man God
[45:18] has Vindicated me he's verified that I
[45:21] would be the messenger to this age I
[45:23] would be the one that would come and
[45:25] open the door to the
[45:27] Gentiles and God just proved it he
[45:31] proved who he was I like in one place
[45:33] when we all that stuff was going on I
[45:35] like in one place and Paul said you've
[45:38] you've challenged me on my what God has
[45:40] given me he said but now I challenge you
[45:44] that he he said see if you're in the
[45:47] faith or not I challenge you to know
[45:50] whether you're in the faith that's what
[45:51] God's challenging us this afternoon is
[45:53] to want to know are you in the faith
[45:56] it's the faith in you is it not it's not
[45:59] just head knowledge but it's a living
[46:01] Oracle inside of your heart that's what
[46:04] Paul's telling us here written Epistles
[46:07] written Epistles it's been written of
[46:08] God it's been thought of God it's been a
[46:09] thought then it come to letter form now

[53:41] Jesus Christ this this man God gave him
[53:44] something special he gave him a heart of
[53:46] understanding that he can understand how

[1:28:23] kind of life because you see there's
[1:28:26] many people won't take time to read the
[1:28:30] Bible right just like that man that
[1:28:33] professed he was a pastor and he act
[1:28:34] like that and I thought man I don't need

[1:28:40] happen people get Church hurt it's on
[1:28:42] the grace of God when pastors go bad and
[1:28:44] they hurt people it's on the grace of
[1:28:45] God if you're if you Ain predes seed you

[1:35:07] have to know about the sympathy first he
[1:35:10] said see it's just it's not just
[1:35:13] something you see it's the changing the
[1:35:17] Junctions of the word of the music it
[1:35:20] throws
[1:35:22] he said it throws people sometimes it's
[1:35:25] going this way while a certain beat
[1:35:29] after a while it changes all around what
[1:35:32] is it to you who wouldn't understand it
[1:35:36] or don't know nothing about it not
[1:35:39] interested in it boy he tells it he said
[1:35:41] it's just a
[1:35:44] racket right he said it's a fuss but oh

[1:36:11] what he told us we'll see the scars in
[1:36:13] his hands spear in his side y oh
[1:36:18] Hallelujah my wife sent me this I had to
[1:36:20] share this week what is a standard
[1:36:23] something we measure ourselves by the
[1:36:28] Bible people try to make the Bible fit
[1:36:31] them when they just have to yield theel
[1:36:33] to the Bible and it'll make them fit it
[1:36:36] written Epistles read of all men do you
[1:36:39] know that a real drama I'm trying to
[1:36:42] close give me some Grace good I don't
[1:36:45] hold you all night I know you smell that
[1:36:49] chicken but you know there's five five
[1:36:51] stages in the drama do you know that I
[1:36:53] didn't know that I mean some of y'all
[1:36:55] may know that there's five stages in the
[1:36:57] drama and it forms a
[1:37:01] pyramid well there's something in that
[1:37:03] some of y'all guys
[1:37:05] that's teachers and know that thing you
[1:37:07] run with that thing you know the first
[1:37:10] stage of the drama is the
[1:37:13] exposition the second is the rising
[1:37:16] action the third is the climax the
[1:37:19] fourth is the falling action the fifth
[1:37:21] is the resolution i c it five stages of
[1:37:25] Grace Amen brother amen glory yeah
[1:37:28] hallelujah
[1:37:29] amen am the exposition look at this
[1:37:32] brothers and sisters the exposition the
[1:37:34] story's starting point the setting of
[1:37:38] the
[1:37:38] characters Oho my
[1:37:41] Hallelujah the extent of the story
[1:37:44] starts with the
[1:37:47] conflict woo that's right right when you
[1:37:50] receive Jesus Christ Christ as your
[1:37:51] savior is a conflict come on between
[1:37:55] this and
[1:37:57] this then brother Brown preach that
[1:37:59] message conflict between God and Satan
[1:38:02] right that's what we battling this man
[1:38:05] here right Paul said when I go to do
[1:38:07] good Evil's always
[1:38:09] present I like this the rising action
[1:38:12] what is the rising action it explores
[1:38:15] the story's conflict up to the
[1:38:18] climax often I like this often things
[1:38:22] get worse because of wrong
[1:38:26] decisions that's right whatsoever a man
[1:38:29] sewe that shall he reap don't fool
[1:38:31] yourself brother and sister a lot of
[1:38:33] stuff we battle is because we sowed it
[1:38:35] but if Grace wasn't here we'd really be
[1:38:37] in trouble he didn't say you wouldn't
[1:38:40] right brother get through it he said but
[1:38:42] you slded it Satan always blam well
[1:38:44] God's doing that cuz but you a lot of
[1:38:45] times we do it oursel brother Mike we
[1:38:47] get in a situation we make wrong choice
[1:38:49] you're going to pay for it
[1:38:51] cuz you're God's son he's going to he's
[1:38:53] going to chasen you for it no doubt and
[1:38:55] if you don't receive chasing it we know
[1:38:57] what that
[1:39:00] means I like that things get worse
[1:39:02] before they get better ain't that what's
[1:39:04] happening right now this is showing us
[1:39:07] what's fixing out we're fixing to get

[1:39:31] third part of it is the
[1:39:33] climax every part of the drama is
[1:39:37] important but the climax is the landing
[1:39:39] spot or the turning point of the
[1:39:44] structure God have
[1:39:46] mercy something happened in this drama

[1:47:41] our brother was saying when we first
[1:47:43] started and singing that song about
[1:47:45] sanctification we're we're speaking on
[1:47:48] the Statue of perfect man actually
[1:47:50] reading those quotes you were reading I
[1:47:52] told him I said oh you got Donnie here
[1:47:54] and you know he works all day and he
[1:47:57] puts two or three motors in he's got
[1:47:59] grease from one crack to one crevice all
[1:48:02] the way and he's just
[1:48:06] nasty but he goes
[1:48:09] home and he takes a
[1:48:11] bath it and when he takes a bath he
[1:48:14] walks out and he just feels
[1:48:17] different and Sue is actually going to
[1:48:19] be able to hug him and kiss him then the
[1:48:22] bride's going to be able to get close
[1:48:24] well God's going to not go get close to
[1:48:26] us if we're dirty right no he's not a
[1:48:30] dirty God so he don't like dirty people
[1:48:33] that's why I believe this message has
[1:48:35] the greatest sanctifying power that has
[1:48:38] ever been given on the face of the Earth
[1:48:40] this message right here
[1:48:43] amen right to live godliness live this
[1:48:47] message You' be a lot closer to God
[1:48:49] that's right amen because he loves
[1:48:53] Holiness because he is godliness our
