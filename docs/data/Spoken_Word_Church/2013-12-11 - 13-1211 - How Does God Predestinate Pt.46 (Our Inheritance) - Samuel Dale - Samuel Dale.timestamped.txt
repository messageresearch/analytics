[3:58] 8
[4:03] and we know that all things work
[4:05] together for good to them that love God
[4:07] to them who are the called according to
[4:09] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[4:12] also did
[4:13] predestinate to be conformed to the
[4:16] image of his son that he might be the
[4:18] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[4:21] whom he did predestinate them he also
[4:23] called and whom he called them he also
[4:25] Justified and whom he justified them he
[4:28] also glorified what shall we then say to
[4:31] these things if God be for us who can be
[4:35] against us let's go over to
[4:38] Mark the 10th
[4:41] chapter we'll begin reading in verse
[4:44] 17 and when he was gone forth into the
[4:47] way there came one running and
[4:49] kneeled to him and asked him good Master
[4:52] what shall I do that I may inherit
[4:55] eternal life and Jesus said unto him why
[4:59] call us th thou me good there is none
[5:01] good but one that is God thou knowest
[5:04] the Commandments do not commit adultery
[5:06] do not kill do not steal do not bear
[5:08] false witness to fraud not honor thy
[5:11] father and thy mother and he answered
[5:13] and said unto him master all these have
[5:16] I observed from my youth then Jesus
[5:20] beholding him loved him and said unto
[5:23] him one thing thou likest go thy way and
[5:27] sell what thou Hast in give to the poor
[5:31] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[5:33] and come take up the cross and follow me
[5:38] you may be seated the Lord add his
[5:39] Blessing to the reading of the
[5:45] word you know what I this past Sunday we
[5:48] were trying to speak about and I want to
[5:50] try to carry the thought on through
[5:52] tonight if we can on but we were talking
[5:55] about how
[5:57] that he was the only
[6:00] begotten of the father all right the
[6:04] only one begotten brother R said that
[6:07] Adam was his created
[6:11] Son by creation but Jesus Was His only
[6:15] begotten son see coming by a woman amen
[6:20] all right and really it would take them
[6:23] the Virgin birth right to bring forth
[6:26] the only begotten that's why it says
[6:28] it's the only begotten that means
[6:30] there's not another one there's not
[6:33] there never will be another one there's
[6:35] never been another one other than he
[6:37] that was begotten right all right
[6:40] because it was begotten in that special
[6:42] way in that he was the Virgin born son
[6:45] of the Living God all right and see that
[6:48] was the point I was trying to get us to
[6:50] to think about uh
[6:53] MDC you can call him God because he was
[6:57] but remember he was spok into existence
[7:00] back out of existence he never had a
[7:02] birth he never had a beginning but the
[7:05] body had a beginning amen uh so then the
[7:10] body had to one day be made Eternal amen
[7:13] now watch that as we go along in the
[7:15] message a little bit tonight because I
[7:17] want to get into that
[7:19] point we realize and we believe that
[7:22] Jesus Christ was God made manifest in
[7:27] human flesh all right and we read there
[7:31] in John and spent a good bit of time
[7:32] talking about it that he was the only
[7:36] begotten of the father God in human
[7:39] flesh right all right now in doing that
[7:46] then by
[7:49] him see you and I can become Sons and
[7:52] Daughters of God okay all right so we we
[7:56] you know we we've been on predestination
[7:58] and this is a a point of getting down to
[8:00] it because the Lord willing will pick it
[8:02] up you know about the seed and start
[8:04] going through those
[8:06] things but getting it into our minds and
[8:09] our thinking about how that God does
[8:13] things he doesn't predestinate by
[8:16] desires he desired that everybody be
[8:19] saved but he predestines by forn
[8:22] knowledge all right see then that way he
[8:24] can predetermine anything by his forn
[8:28] knowledge
[8:30] and it's going to take place amen all
[8:33] right so you got a double point to be
[8:35] remember his for knowledge would be the
[8:37] fact that he would see it but then by
[8:39] him seeing it see then he would uh would
[8:42] speak it and that would be it he he saw
[8:45] Jesus Christ die before the foundation
[8:48] of the world in his mind right all right
[8:50] and he spoke it right all right so when
[8:53] he spoke it now all it had to do was
[8:55] wait till a time to come into reality
[8:58] right
[8:59] all right but it had to come into a
[9:01] reality to be that point see all right
[9:05] but now remember our point was
[9:08] that God never let man just go out of
[9:11] the
[9:12] garden he said I'll go with you right
[9:14] amen he came out he came down through
[9:16] the Old Testament we brought him through
[9:18] the Christ showing it coming down and
[9:21] brought him down then uh you know Sunday
[9:24] there to the only
[9:27] begotten as to being what what a body
[9:30] Hebrews 105 was
[9:33] prepared but the soul and the spirit was
[9:37] allmighty God himself that's right all
[9:39] right and see you can't kill God we know
[9:43] that because there's no way to kill that
[9:46] soul and that Spirit there's no way to
[9:49] kill your soul and spirit anybody can
[9:52] kill you whatever take your life but
[9:54] that doesn't kill your soul or your
[9:56] spirit it has to continue on somewhere
[9:58] else right all right so then there's no
[10:00] need of even trying to figure out well
[10:02] could he do no just take it what it
[10:05] says God was living in human
[10:09] flesh called a
[10:12] son all right now the reason he was
[10:15] called a son would be just what I said
[10:18] he was begotten amen he was brought into
[10:22] being a body thou Hast prepared me all
[10:26] right now and brought into be being
[10:29] there as as a human being a
[10:33] mortal fine that was that was fine cuz
[10:36] that's what it was all right but then by
[10:41] him giving up his life remember he
[10:45] didn't send a son didn't send somebody
[10:47] else he came himself by him giving up
[10:51] his life that was in him would be the
[10:54] only way you and I could be saved that's
[10:58] right amen
[11:00] it it's not the doctrines of the people
[11:02] of the message you know always was
[11:03] eternal but then you don't need Jesus so
[11:06] you you got your own little salvation
[11:08] and your own little going you don't need
[11:10] Jesus well what we need him for is to
[11:13] get us a
[11:14] revelation well you mean nobody wouldn't
[11:17] saved till you got a
[11:20] revelation I hope that went
[11:22] across until you got a revelation
[11:25] because that's their idea see all right
[11:28] but see now Rich Young
[11:30] Ruler he wanted to
[11:34] know what could he do he had
[11:37] heard this man you know and heard of him
[11:40] and maybe been in meetings and things
[11:44] because he he
[11:46] did know enough to know that this man
[11:49] was talking some way about eternal life
[11:53] amen so he he comes to him and he's he's
[11:57] wanting to know how can I have eternal
[12:03] life
[12:05] right he had kept all the
[12:07] laws he kept all the rules he kept all
[12:11] the regulations so then it wouldn't be
[12:13] as brother brandham said when somebody
[12:16] ask us today what must we do to be saved
[12:18] Did we tell them to quit this and quit
[12:20] that and stop this and don't don't do
[12:22] that that's rules and regulations now
[12:24] this man had kept all of them yes sir
[12:28] amen he kept all the rules the
[12:30] regulations the things to do or not
[12:32] do but he still recognized that he
[12:35] needed eternal
[12:37] life okay
[12:39] now now follow the point just for a
[12:41] second then we'll move on into the
[12:44] message but Jesus
[12:48] knew now follow me just for a minute and
[12:50] listen Jesus knew right then and there
[12:56] now are you with me right then and there
[12:58] him standing
[13:00] there he knew he could not just hand him
[13:05] eternal life right sure are you with me
[13:09] right amen if he could why didn't he
[13:12] right I mean you got a GU kept all the
[13:13] rules and regulations you lined up with
[13:15] the law a perfect guy as far as the
[13:18] world would be
[13:20] counted all
[13:24] right but see he knew that he could not
[13:27] give him
[13:30] at that moment eternal life that's
[13:33] right now watch about what he said to
[13:36] him see he knew that he had to
[13:40] die you know he knew Jesus knew he had
[13:43] to
[13:44] die to release that life that would be
[13:47] in him cuz he knew that eternal life was
[13:50] in him right right sure so he knew that
[13:55] the only way to release that was him
[13:58] dying yep okay are you following me them
[14:02] amen so notice what he
[14:04] said take up your
[14:06] cross and come and follow
[14:09] me now we put most of our emphasis on
[14:12] the fact that he was a rich guy and
[14:15] money got in his way and that's
[14:17] true that's where you didn't follow
[14:21] him but I'd like for you to think a
[14:23] little bit about
[14:26] this you think that what if he
[14:30] had what if he had a give all he
[14:34] had
[14:37] you and followed
[14:41] Jesus would that give him eternal
[14:46] life are you listening now would it have
[14:50] given him eternal
[14:54] life so then when Jesus said follow me
[14:59] he had something else in mind other than
[15:02] just back up your Duds walk with me
[15:05] we'll go down the highway one of these
[15:06] days I'll decide to give it to
[15:08] you he
[15:10] knew that he had to
[15:13] die he knew he had to die to release
[15:17] that life to where it could go back into
[15:19] that Rich Young Ruler that's right all
[15:22] right cuz there was no way to give it to
[15:24] him right there where he was at
[15:31] now where did Jesus really mean for him
[15:35] to follow
[15:37] him did he mean to just walk down the
[15:40] roads with
[15:44] him then would that have brought him
[15:46] eternal
[15:49] life if I was going to preach like these
[15:51] brothers the message you know she always
[15:53] was eternal I'd at least put a little
[15:55] bit of stipulation in it you know that
[15:57] they did follow him you know and do what
[15:59] he said and some didn't follow him and
[16:01] do what he said and you know but I want
[16:05] you to think about
[16:07] something where was Jesus actually
[16:09] wanting him to
[16:14] follow why was it that
[16:18] Judas yet he did follow
[16:22] him walked with
[16:26] him brother brand said he never made it
[16:28] to Pentecost that's
[16:32] right right so what was he talking about
[16:36] I just thought about these scriptures
[16:37] and I thought tonight I'd put a few
[16:39] scriptures in with with the thought you
[16:42] know I try to do that anyway but
[16:44] sometimes you're quoting scriptures and
[16:46] and people don't realize you are quoting
[16:48] if you'll listen to brother Bram that's
[16:50] what always amazed me I I'm I'm always
[16:53] had a decent memory decent and and I had
[16:56] a decent knowledge of the scriptures
[16:58] well I'd be listening to brother randam
[16:59] and you know I mean it's hard to listen
[17:02] to him sometime because he'll be talking
[17:05] and he'll quote about three scriptures
[17:07] right in a
[17:08] row I mean he he just quoting scriptures
[17:11] constantly amen you said well I never
[17:14] seen it that well just pull something he
[17:17] says and run it back over in the Bible
[17:19] and see if that's
[17:22] right he'd be quoting scriptures most of
[17:25] the time and then sometimes he'd say it
[17:27] like this he'd say now I've got a
[17:31] scripture in
[17:33] mind you ever noticed him saying it that
[17:35] way I've got a scripture in mind but see
[17:37] he's looking at something right well
[17:39] then when he preaches to
[17:41] there he doesn't always tell us that
[17:45] scripture right he expects us to know
[17:49] the scriptures all
[17:51] right now look at the scriptures what
[17:54] what we got a few things here is to be
[17:56] said for a moment of this you
[18:00] know what this Rich Young Ruler didn't
[18:05] do but yet what would have he had done
[18:08] if he had have followed Jesus literally
[18:14] right look at Matthew 19 I've just kind
[18:17] of put these in a little order I want
[18:19] you to just think about
[18:23] it Matthew 19: 28-
[18:26] 29 and Jesus said un to them verily
[18:29] verily I say unto you and ye which have
[18:32] followed
[18:33] me in the
[18:38] Regeneration when the son of man shall
[18:40] sit on his sit in his throne in heaven
[18:42] you also shall sit upon 12 Thrones
[18:45] judging the 12 tribes of Israel and
[18:48] everyone that have forsaken
[18:50] houses or
[18:51] Brethren sisters father mother wife
[18:55] children lands for my sake shall receive
[18:59] a hundredfold and inher shall inherit
[19:03] everlasting life now that word
[19:06] Everlasting there is eternal right now
[19:11] he said follow me in the Regeneration
[19:15] amen so if the Rich Young Ruler had
[19:17] followed him all through his
[19:21] life from the time he contacted
[19:25] him would that have saved him
[19:29] no right right he had to follow him into
[19:35] regeneration now he didn't need
[19:39] regeneration right so he's not saying
[19:42] I'm going to go through it and you going
[19:44] to go through it right right right come
[19:46] on we got no sense to know that
[19:49] okay so what was he actually
[19:55] saying he said follow me in the regen
[19:58] generation he said in other
[20:01] words you get
[20:06] regenerated that's the way I want you to
[20:08] follow me right but it said
[20:11] now for you to walk with
[20:15] me is not
[20:18] it for you to take every step I
[20:22] take for you to do all these things you
[20:24] get beat you get whipped you get done no
[20:28] it was to follow him into
[20:30] regeneration now as I said we know for
[20:33] shity that he was not talking about that
[20:36] he would have to go through a
[20:40] regeneration but he knew what he was
[20:42] going to have to go through with to
[20:44] bring about our
[20:46] regeneration
[20:48] right so he was actually saying it
[20:51] follow me in the
[20:56] Regeneration go his part was he had to
[21:01] die to release that
[21:04] life right and then he says now if
[21:07] you'll do that you'll do these
[21:10] things you
[21:13] shall in HT eternal life all right
[21:17] speaking of the new
[21:20] birth which could not come at that time
[21:23] that he was talking why because John 7
[21:26] says it 3 and
[21:29] 39 3 37 3839 John 7 what does it say
[21:37] see and in the last day the great day of
[21:40] the feast Jesus stood and cried say If
[21:43] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[21:44] drink he that believeth on me as the
[21:47] scripture sayth said out of his belly
[21:50] shall flow rivers of Living
[21:52] Water but this spake of the spirit which
[21:56] they that believe on him should receive
[21:59] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[22:04] why because that Jesus was not yet
[22:09] glorified so follow me in the
[22:14] Regeneration but I'm not going to have
[22:16] to go through a new birth I'm going to
[22:20] go through a
[22:22] death burial or
[22:25] resurrection and then I'm going to give
[22:27] my life life to you y right and that
[22:30] would follow into that regeneration
[22:33] right look at what Titus three and five
[22:37] has to say about
[22:39] it not by works of righteousness which
[22:42] we have done but according to his Mercy
[22:44] he saved us by what the washing of
[22:49] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[22:52] Ghost amen
[22:55] all see then he knew that
[22:59] he would have to
[23:02] die to release that
[23:06] life that would be in him now you wonder
[23:10] why did I I keep emphasizing that in a
[23:13] minute then I hope it'll take away the
[23:15] carnality of our thoughts when we really
[23:18] get down to the
[23:20] point because our carnality of our
[23:22] thoughts can be locked in and and we not
[23:24] even realize that that we're not
[23:26] listening we are interpreting while we
[23:29] listen what somebody
[23:32] says I've said things and people come to
[23:34] me and say Brother D you said so I said
[23:35] I didn't say
[23:38] it yes you did I heard you I said okay
[23:41] we'll go get the
[23:44] tape cuz I don't mind it if I said it to
[23:47] say I'm sorry I shouldn't have said it
[23:48] that way but when I don't say
[23:53] something but I heard you say it well
[23:56] the rest of the building and the tape
[23:57] didn't
[23:59] and you see that's where we get our own
[24:01] little ideas and thoughts and and we
[24:05] interpret what somebody says or
[24:08] translated or whatever you want to say
[24:09] in our minds and not saying what the
[24:12] person has said Jesus never said that
[24:17] John was going to
[24:19] live until his return right how be it
[24:24] the Bible says they went a Doctrine out
[24:27] among them
[24:29] they said John wasn't going to
[24:31] die said Jesus didn't say that
[24:37] right he said how be it unto you if he
[24:39] does that's right in other words what
[24:41] your business is it
[24:44] all but see Jesus Christ knew before you
[24:48] and I could have a new
[24:50] birth eternal
[24:54] life that that life would have to be
[24:57] least out of
[24:59] him amen right right and I said now if
[25:03] you think you already got eternal life
[25:06] then this don't mean a thing to you and
[25:08] neither does the death of Jesus Christ
[25:11] right all
[25:14] right see then what did Jesus
[25:17] do we got right up to it our Sunday and
[25:20] I said I'd have to take it later because
[25:21] it didn't have enough
[25:25] time you know that Jesus Christ died
[25:30] to bring us to our inheritance
[25:34] amen all
[25:36] right now think about what I'm
[25:40] saying and then you'll understand why
[25:43] it's stated so much like it
[25:46] is look at number
[25:51] four which is adoption 1960 paragraph
[25:56] 75 look has predestinated us unto this
[26:04] inheritance all
[26:06] right if I a right inheritance of
[26:11] something if God is knocking at my heart
[26:14] and saying William bradam I called you a
[26:17] long time ago before the foundation of
[26:19] the world to preach the gospel I have an
[26:23] inheritance an
[26:25] inheritance of eternal life
[26:30] right well brother they always was
[26:33] eternal well now why does the rest of it
[26:36] go with it then now God sent Jesus to
[26:41] make that inheritance real to
[26:45] me because there was nothing I could do
[26:48] to it to inherit
[26:52] it nothing I could do it was blank it
[26:56] was valid
[26:58] there's nothing I can do but in the
[27:00] fullness of time God sent in his own
[27:02] good time Jesus the lamb slain from the
[27:06] foundation of the world his blood was
[27:08] shed that I might go to my
[27:12] inheritance now he's just talking about
[27:14] your inheritance and eternal life he
[27:17] might go to your inheritance to be what
[27:20] what
[27:21] inheritance to sunship to be a Son of
[27:25] God right
[27:30] now to my
[27:33] inheritance of eternal
[27:38] life that's a great
[27:41] statement all
[27:44] right but now
[27:46] remember that before Jesus could give
[27:49] eternal life to the Rich Young
[27:51] Ruler it mean he had to die right so
[27:55] thereby the Rich Young Ruler didn't
[27:56] follow him
[27:59] right right in the Regeneration right
[28:03] but they did on the day of Pentecost
[28:06] some followed him all right so what
[28:08] happened look at the next one this is
[28:11] adoption U part 3
[28:14] 6 522 in the
[28:19] morning
[28:21] inheritance by
[28:25] predestination I in heard inited
[28:29] something what
[28:31] inheritance there had to be somebody
[28:33] leave me an
[28:35] inheritance why you say Jesus left you
[28:38] an
[28:40] inheritance watch now beg your pardon
[28:44] that's right Jesus never left me an
[28:47] inheritance Jesus never left you an
[28:54] inheritance now follow what I'm saying
[28:56] and then we'll just keep keep going with
[28:57] it Jesus never
[29:00] gave anybody eternal
[29:09] life
[29:13] yeah he had to die that's right sir so
[29:17] now you're following what he's saying
[29:19] Jesus left you an inheritance beg your
[29:21] pardon Jesus never left me an
[29:22] inheritance J Jesus never left you an
[29:24] inheritance he only came down and paid
[29:27] for your inheritance that's that's
[29:30] right brought you to your
[29:34] inheritance but your name was put on the
[29:37] L book of life before the foundation of
[29:39] the
[29:40] world God give you your
[29:46] inheritance your inheritance was
[29:51] first before anything right Jesus only
[29:56] come a lot here's the way that they try
[29:58] to make it say well there's a lot of
[30:00] people lost and and I'll go down and
[30:02] maybe they'll feel sorry for me and
[30:04] everything no he said I don't run my
[30:07] business like that and Jesus wouldn't
[30:08] run his right but get back up here to
[30:11] where we at Jesus never left you an
[30:17] inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never
[30:19] left us an
[30:21] inheritance he only came down and paid
[30:25] for your inheritance that's right now
[30:28] how did he pay for your
[30:32] inheritance how did Jesus pay for your
[30:39] inheritance by giving his own life
[30:42] that's right amen true that's right
[30:45] right by giving his own life amen all
[30:49] right
[30:51] now so when he only come down to do what
[30:55] he brought you to your inheritance
[31:01] he never come to do but he come to bring
[31:04] you
[31:08] amen so look what he goes on to say next
[31:16] paragraph God by his for knowledge
[31:19] seeing exactly who would be saved and
[31:21] who wouldn't be
[31:23] saved He sent Jesus to save those that
[31:27] he' already
[31:29] chosen now we're going to get to eternal
[31:32] life in a minute and see what it is
[31:34] didn't Paul say five verses behind that
[31:37] he chose us in him before there even was
[31:40] a
[31:41] world that's our
[31:45] inheritance what's our
[31:48] inheritance that we was chosen in him
[31:50] before the foundation of the
[31:52] world right God chose us and let Jesus
[31:57] come and pay the
[31:59] price the what his shedding of his blood
[32:03] that no sin would be accounted to us
[32:06] nothing you do all right
[32:10] now eternal
[32:16] life that's what everybody's concerned
[32:20] about how do we get eternal
[32:25] life okay
[32:29] the only way I know of receiving getting
[32:32] eternal life is for somebody to have to
[32:34] give it to you that's sensible that
[32:37] shouldn't need a great light bub to turn
[32:39] on it's just plain
[32:42] language but Jesus on this
[32:45] Earth even though he was the word made
[32:50] flesh right he could not at that time
[32:55] impart eternal life
[33:01] all right so now if we know he couldn't
[33:03] do it then nobody else couldn't do it
[33:05] true
[33:07] right but he knew that he was going to
[33:09] have to
[33:12] die to
[33:14] release that eternal
[33:20] life that's how
[33:23] Jesus never gave you an inheritance
[33:25] right
[33:28] if it have been he would have give it to
[33:33] us he paid the price yes right by dying
[33:38] right
[33:39] right and he said if you'll follow me in
[33:42] the Regeneration that's
[33:45] right all right then you'll have eternal
[33:48] life is that what we've just been
[33:51] through so then the only way to have
[33:53] eternal
[33:54] life is for Jesus Christ to have died
[33:59] all
[34:00] right and you know how I believe it the
[34:02] only way you and I can have eternal life
[34:05] is to die to
[34:06] ourselves and accept Jesus Christ as our
[34:09] savior amen amen all
[34:13] right but think about
[34:16] it think about what he done when he
[34:21] died think about as I said the other
[34:23] week there when he says you know this
[34:25] day this scripture is fulfilled
[34:28] think of all the other scriptures that
[34:30] he
[34:32] read he knew what he was going to have
[34:34] to
[34:36] do he knew when Isaiah said or uh was
[34:41] which one David said they pierc my hands
[34:43] and my
[34:45] feet he knew that they'd wag their head
[34:48] at him
[34:51] and he knew they'd beat him y to where
[34:55] he'd be unrecognizable
[34:58] he knew
[35:01] that
[35:03] right but yet he went through that where
[35:05] we could have eternal life amen
[35:08] right I know church I know sometimes I
[35:11] get arrogant and hateful about the way I
[35:13] say things about the preachers of this
[35:15] message
[35:17] but if you think so little of the
[35:20] eternal life that you have in
[35:22] you to let somebody pack down your
[35:25] throat the garbage
[35:28] cans of this
[35:31] message then you think nothing of
[35:33] eternal
[35:36] life I'm I'm as honest as I can be and
[35:39] I'm not mean and hateful I don't think I
[35:41] am but anybody with the truth ought to
[35:44] be just about ready to P the eyeballs
[35:46] out of these
[35:47] people and cut their tongues off you
[35:50] know they used to kill their own
[35:52] children in the Bible that prophesied
[35:56] wrong y do we need the Bible to to talk
[35:59] about that you know they used to kill
[36:01] them right y somebody prophesy Li what
[36:05] no problem just kill
[36:09] it we're not in that doings
[36:14] but you think about the eternal life
[36:16] that
[36:18] you you died to yourself to receive the
[36:22] life of Jesus Christ you turned against
[36:25] the world you went against what
[36:27] everybody else was going the world and
[36:29] the things and all like that and you
[36:32] gave your life to Jesus
[36:34] Christ and you've tried in your life to
[36:37] serve
[36:38] him when it could have been very easy
[36:41] could have been the things of the world
[36:43] and doing those things and even today
[36:45] been a religious person on your way to
[36:47] heaven and some preacher is going to
[36:49] preach you to heaven when you
[36:54] die you see what I'm trying trying my
[36:57] best to get one thing to
[37:01] you is to get you to think about what
[37:03] youve
[37:05] got and then you would let somebody
[37:08] brother around and said you go down here
[37:09] to a cafe and he said you you see a fly
[37:13] in your soup while you ready to sue the
[37:16] the cafe and the owners and the head
[37:18] owners and and
[37:19] everybody you wouldn't dare eat it you
[37:22] wouldn't take out to fly well he didn't
[37:26] eat to too
[37:28] much and eat resty your
[37:31] soup
[37:34] no I mean I'm honest I wouldn't even
[37:37] want another another uh replacement of
[37:41] soup
[37:43] right come i' figure it's coming out of
[37:45] the same Barrel that's
[37:48] right had a good life at the hos at the
[37:51] doctor's office yesterday you know you
[37:52] always talk about how old we are and how
[37:55] you have to buy you know these ointments
[37:57] of being gays and the stuff you know and
[37:59] buying a 5 gallon bucket I turned around
[38:02] and handed my wife is play in the
[38:05] Magazine and there it was selling these
[38:08] SES and things to rub on you in five
[38:11] gallon buckets I had I have to maybe
[38:14] I'll life that off and get out of the
[38:15] other parts of me
[38:18] okay now
[38:24] listen we talk about inheritance
[38:28] we talk about inherit and eternal
[38:31] life I want to ask you a
[38:37] question do you realize that Jesus
[38:39] coming the way he
[38:41] did and doing what he
[38:46] done would you believe that he inherited
[38:49] eternal
[38:53] life you're quiet ain't
[38:55] you
[39:00] what about him in her in eternal
[39:05] life you said wait a minute brother Dale
[39:07] you gone too
[39:09] far he was eternal life right
[39:14] agreed let's just let the prophet say it
[39:17] where we don't have to worry then okay
[39:19] go ahead number
[39:21] six which is paragraph 56 of Gabriel's
[39:24] instructions to Daniel
[39:27] 61 7:30 the morning service and we find
[39:31] that he was our kinsman
[39:33] redeemer and he took the book out of the
[39:35] hand of the original owner it was a
[39:37] title deed to Redemption we found that
[39:40] you remember the study it's a title deed
[39:43] of redemption it's an abstract deed with
[39:46] it and God required life or death in the
[39:51] Garden of
[39:53] Eden
[39:55] right that's right he required life for
[39:59] death in the garden when they died in
[40:01] the garden he had to take a life right
[40:03] an animal of his
[40:04] own so he
[40:07] required life back for their death are
[40:12] you listen to what he's
[40:13] saying then Jesus the righteous one died
[40:17] and took a title deed and was able to
[40:20] break the seals reveal what was in them
[40:23] and give the inheritance that belong to
[40:27] him to his
[40:31] people if you done read that last next
[40:36] verse eternal life that he inherited by
[40:40] doing
[40:44] that oh no you better explain
[40:47] yourself all
[40:52] right he was eternal
[40:55] life he didn't get eternal life in his
[40:58] soul and his spirit that was eternal
[41:01] life but his body was not Eternal that's
[41:05] right by going through the
[41:09] fact that he would die to release that
[41:13] life that was in
[41:17] him by the death that he died Rel you
[41:20] know leaving the body then the body
[41:23] would be made
[41:25] eternal
[41:28] so the prophet's right right
[41:31] amen he
[41:32] inherited eternal life in
[41:35] flesh right amen come on are you with me
[41:40] sir that's right by dying himself by
[41:44] going through what he done to let that
[41:47] life that was within him the body be
[41:54] released then that body would become
[41:58] Eternal and it did in the
[42:00] resurrection amen sir now remember it's
[42:03] like the future home I believe it is or
[42:05] Christ somewhere in there I've got it in
[42:08] my
[42:09] memory that see Jesus's body was not
[42:12] Eternal it had to be made Eternal amen
[42:15] that's
[42:17] right see he inherited eternal life he
[42:21] the
[42:23] body inherited eternal life
[42:26] by going through what he went through
[42:35] right what about you and
[42:38] I are we willing to die
[42:43] ourselves to receive eternal
[42:48] life no always had
[42:51] it well you might as well click off out
[42:54] there if that's what you believe cuz
[42:56] because we certainly don't around here
[42:58] believe that that's right amen
[43:02] right but your Prophet is one that said
[43:04] it I
[43:06] didn't he said it's a title deed of
[43:08] redemption it's an abstract deed with it
[43:11] that God required life for death in the
[43:15] Garden of Eden he had to take a life
[43:18] because they
[43:20] died right all right then Jesus the
[43:24] righteous one
[43:28] died and watch what brother around say
[43:30] what Adam
[43:32] lost Jesus Christ restores right in
[43:36] Jesus the righteous one died and took a
[43:39] title deed and was able to break the
[43:41] seals reveal what was in them and give
[43:45] the inheritance that belong to
[43:52] him now watch's
[43:55] that
[43:56] his
[43:57] people eternal life that he inherited by
[44:02] doing
[44:03] that now how did he inher eternal life
[44:06] he passed his own life back out at
[44:10] Calvary and divided it Among Us by the
[44:13] Holy Ghost amen no man has never been
[44:16] able to come to even think of the love
[44:20] that was that that was what he
[44:23] done he died that you and
[44:28] I could receive what was inside of
[44:32] him all
[44:34] right and by doing that he in he the
[44:39] body
[44:40] inherited eternal life that's right or
[44:44] was made Eternal
[44:46] right you remember the other day when we
[44:48] talking about we had the Eternal
[44:50] atonement
[44:52] see
[44:53] he released that life
[44:57] that could come back in you and I that's
[44:58] why there's just one true and living God
[45:01] it's not something that God sent another
[45:02] son or something or another person or
[45:04] this or that or the other he came
[45:07] himself amen and lived in human flesh
[45:11] that's
[45:13] right right is that the Bible in him
[45:15] dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[45:17] bodily the body part was a creation
[45:21] right that had a
[45:24] beginning but by going through what he
[45:26] went
[45:30] through the body inherited it right
[45:34] right oh church if you can see what I'm
[45:37] talking about
[45:38] then if he knew
[45:43] that he was
[45:46] willing maybe that's what happened in
[45:48] the
[45:49] garden he knew he was going to have to
[45:51] die didn't he he prayed Lord but anyway
[45:56] let this
[45:59] pass I said
[46:01] Lord if this is the only way I can get
[46:04] eternal life to those other
[46:06] people that you've seen would want
[46:10] it then I'll go through with
[46:13] it
[46:15] amen
[46:18] right maybe his mind drifted back then
[46:21] to one
[46:24] day that he was standing there on Earth
[46:27] and he
[46:29] said
[46:31] father he said glorify me with the
[46:36] glory that I had with you before the
[46:41] world glorified right and what did God
[46:45] speak
[46:47] back I have both
[46:51] glorified thy
[46:53] name I'll glorify it again
[46:56] y I'm going to glorify you I'm going to
[46:59] give you eternal
[47:03] life you see we talk about an
[47:05] inheritance thinking about it some form
[47:07] of something that you and I we just get
[47:09] by being good
[47:11] people now I hope this will take that
[47:13] all out of there that when we get into
[47:16] predestination and the seed and the life
[47:19] and the carriers and the goings and that
[47:22] it will bring to our remembrance these
[47:24] things
[47:26] MH you see why I couldn't finish Sunday
[47:29] what I was doing I had to I mean we'
[47:31] have been 4 hours we' have been an
[47:33] afternoon cuz right now I'm I'm pushing
[47:35] to try to get
[47:38] through how long could you preach on
[47:42] it well brother Dale I never heard
[47:44] nobody say that Jesus had to inherit
[47:46] eternal life well see you you got your
[47:49] mind
[47:51] locked when I say Jesus I'm talking
[47:54] about the flesh right now when I say God
[47:58] I'm talking about I'll say Jesus
[48:01] Christ because Jesus Christ was almighty
[48:05] God Jesus Christ couldn't die that's
[48:12] right you can't kill that anointing that
[48:14] Christ that's right but Jesus the
[48:19] man was a product made for
[48:23] death to become a Kinsman Redeemer amen
[48:26] thank you Lord Boaz didn't have to die
[48:30] to give Naomi The Inheritance and then
[48:33] get
[48:33] Ruth
[48:35] right cuz you can give
[48:39] inheritances you can give your kids
[48:41] stuff and things you can you can give
[48:43] inheritance while you're alive and
[48:45] really it's the best thing in the world
[48:46] to do cuz they don't have to pay taxes
[48:48] on the
[48:50] stuff you whether you die and they have
[48:53] to pay all these taxes on in
[48:56] inheritance well figure out
[49:01] something but now
[49:06] listen he
[49:09] then received eternal life in
[49:17] Body by releasing the life that was in
[49:21] him you and I receive eternal life amen
[49:26] now follow the L of the
[49:29] quote if you would pull it back up
[49:31] brother
[49:34] Anderson by him releasing his
[49:39] life paying the
[49:43] price could bring us eternal life
[49:47] right all right the only way I could
[49:49] ever
[49:50] come well I was born with
[49:53] it well forget it
[49:56] according to my Bible and I Prophet you
[49:58] born in sin shav in iniquity spouse and
[50:00] mother's wound and you're a
[50:02] liar and if I say that I'm a liar so you
[50:06] calling me a liar Brother D
[50:09] yeah does it need to be said
[50:14] again but you see I'm trying to preach
[50:16] eternal life amen I ain't playing little
[50:20] kitty cat you know sugar tit doctrines
[50:22] and
[50:24] ideas come come on tell me you think I'm
[50:27] exalted tell me if youve ever heard

[50:39] right have you ever heard anybody say
[50:41] that Jesus inherited eternal
[50:46] life oh I'm

[50:53] what is it the truth
[50:57] why can't we glory in the truth even the
[50:59] dumb donkey that's right can tell the
[51:03] truth that's right yes sir yeah no no
[51:06] that's Brother D don't believe that
[51:08] don't believe what you don't believe
[51:10] you're a
[51:12] prophet read
[51:15] it what did he
[51:19] do give the inheritance that belong to
[51:24] him
[51:28] to his
[51:33] people you realize that
[51:36] man the man the
[51:41] flesh had within
[51:43] him our
[51:50] inheritance if not where did it come
[51:52] from he had it in Him Sister G
[51:56] and he knew the only way we could get it
[51:58] was release
[52:00] it well then that's giving us no that's
[52:02] not giving us Eternal because remember
[52:05] he's inheriting the same as we're
[52:10] inheriting go think about
[52:13] it eternal life that he inherited by
[52:16] doing
[52:17] that he passed his own life back out at
[52:21] Calvary and divided it Among Us by the
[52:25] holy Holy
[52:26] Ghost the life that was in him came out
[52:30] and right
[52:32] back but it didn't finish in you and I
[52:38] right
[52:40] why
[52:42] because we only have the earnest of our
[52:46] inheritance
[52:49] right see if he hadn't to give his
[52:53] life there was no no way anybody else
[52:56] could be saved no way nobody else could
[52:59] get eternal
[53:01] life so he knew by releasing the life
[53:04] that it could come back in you and I and
[53:07] notice what it
[53:09] says inheritance that belong to
[53:13] him to his
[53:16] people now let's see if you can
[53:20] swallow see the only way you and I are
[53:23] going to get eternal life in flesh
[53:29] are you following me eternal the only
[53:31] way you and I are going to get eternal
[53:34] life in
[53:39] flesh is for him to come back inside of
[53:42] us
[53:48] first
[53:49] start giving
[53:52] us our inheritance right and I said that
[53:55] the way I wanted it giving us started it
[53:58] we're being born again that
[54:02] scripture see we only have the
[54:05] earnest of our
[54:08] inheritance cuz this is not he hasn't
[54:12] taken possession yet right now how are
[54:14] we going to get these
[54:18] bodies there's the
[54:20] key and give the inheritance that belong
[54:23] to him
[54:25] to his
[54:27] people eternal life belong to
[54:30] him the Bible says that the son of man
[54:34] have power to forgive sins and the Bible
[54:37] says the son of man ha power to give
[54:43] life
[54:45] right he's got the power that's
[54:50] right see he didn't
[54:53] die that that we might that would make
[54:56] us an
[54:58] inheritance are you following me see he
[55:00] never died to make us an inheritance
[55:02] that be him giving it to us he died to
[55:06] release what was in him that was our
[55:09] original
[55:12] inheritance our inheritance is eternal
[55:17] life through Jesus Christ we'll get to
[55:20] it in the scripture go ahead look at
[55:22] number seven got a few scriptures now to
[55:24] read and then we'll
[55:26] look what he says you're on adoption
[55:28] part 4 60 5522 in the evening paragraph
[55:35] 71 he said in whom we have obtained an
[55:40] inheritance in whom also we have
[55:45] obtained an
[55:49] inheritance oh an inheritance somebody
[55:52] has to leave you something to inherit it
[55:55] is that right an inheritance what
[55:57] inheritance do we
[55:59] have what inheritance did I
[56:02] have I didn't have
[56:07] any oh but always was eternal brother
[56:10] Dale you just don't
[56:13] understand well according to
[56:17] him but God left me an
[56:23] inheritance when he put my name on the L
[56:26] book of life before the foundation of
[56:29] the world y That's
[56:32] Right inheritance has to do with a whe
[56:36] right you
[56:38] know I mean you you die you know and and
[56:44] you you've got to have a wheel CU if you
[56:46] don't stay can just take it they do a
[56:49] pretty good job anyway but I mean they
[56:51] can just take it if there's no will
[56:55] then you're at the mercy of the
[56:59] state right they can decide what to do
[57:02] with what and eat up a lot of it
[57:06] in whatever you call
[57:08] them you
[57:12] know right A
[57:17] Wheel so
[57:18] then where's my
[57:23] Wheel
[57:26] now we've been through it
[57:28] and remember
[57:31] now not a Scofield or yeah whatever but
[57:36] the Bible is the book in the hand of the
[57:39] one sitting on the throne we've been
[57:41] through
[57:43] that all right and there is my will
[57:47] which is my Abstract title deed right
[57:52] amen and this whe in here tells me what
[57:55] belongs to
[57:57] Meen that's
[58:00] right right you make out a will you say
[58:03] in the will I leave we have three kids I
[58:08] leave my inheritance to divided we
[58:10] divided equally between my three
[58:12] children that's a will okay the state
[58:15] goes by that and they divided equally
[58:17] between the three right or I say well
[58:21] I'm going to give one so much and the
[58:23] other one so much and they have to abide
[58:25] by
[58:26] that and if I say well one of them's
[58:28] been a dirty rotten stinker and I'm not
[58:30] going to give them nothing but $1 now
[58:33] technically by the law if you've made a
[58:36] will you better state it that way you
[58:38] better state that i' be quit $1 to so
[58:42] and so then they can't protest to will
[58:45] but if you don't put that Dollar on
[58:46] there they can get you all right that's
[58:50] now a
[58:52] will the word of God is your will
[58:55] and your name was
[58:57] written in the book of life before the
[58:59] foundation of the world or it never will
[59:02] be written there right amen all right
[59:04] there as you will right here is the
[59:05] Bible
[59:08] amen are you with me this
[59:12] Bible is God's will to
[59:15] man this Bible tells me my inheritance
[59:20] cuz that's what a will tells you right
[59:22] right will tells you what you're
[59:23] inheriting this Bible tells me what I'm
[59:27] inheriting so there's my
[59:30] will there's my title deed of
[59:34] redemption there's everything I
[59:43] need you know your Prophet says
[59:46] this he said we are losing our
[59:51] inheritance every day
[59:53] yep
[59:56] he's not talking about eternal life you
[59:59] can't lose it right
[1:00:02] right we're losing our inheritance which
[1:00:05] is healing salvation Deliverance right
[1:00:10] right and we're losing
[1:00:15] it because we're not taking the book
[1:00:18] right the will and taking it before the
[1:00:21] court and say listen this is
[1:00:23] mine
[1:00:25] now you know the government's crooked
[1:00:27] all are crooked but we're not talking
[1:00:28] about crooked we're talking about what
[1:00:29] it's supposed to be if you got a will
[1:00:31] and it's authorized will stamped and got
[1:00:33] the seal on it everything done signed by
[1:00:35] Witnesses Etc you take it into the court
[1:00:37] it's supposed to be uh read
[1:00:41] right and abided by because it's
[1:00:45] completely authentic well this Bible is
[1:00:47] completely authentic
[1:00:53] that's but before the foundation of the
[1:00:59] world pull that back up let's look at it
[1:01:01] again number seven
[1:01:04] brother an inheritance somebody has to
[1:01:06] leave you something to inherit it is
[1:01:08] that right an inheritance what
[1:01:10] inheritance do we have what inheritance
[1:01:13] did I have I didn't have any but God
[1:01:16] left me
[1:01:17] inheritance
[1:01:19] when he put my name on the land book of
[1:01:22] life before the found found of the world
[1:01:26] oh you say but wait a minute brother
[1:01:28] Jesus did that when he died for
[1:01:32] you no he
[1:01:37] never roll it up where they make sure
[1:01:39] can see it brother Anderson you say now
[1:01:42] wait a minute brother Jesus did that
[1:01:44] when he died for
[1:01:46] me no he
[1:01:48] never Jesus come to purchase that
[1:01:51] inheritance for me said read the very
[1:01:55] next verse in whom we also have
[1:01:59] obtained an inheritance being
[1:02:02] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:02:04] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:02:06] counsel of his own
[1:02:09] will goes back to predestination
[1:02:17] amen predestination goes back to forn
[1:02:19] knowledge
[1:02:21] right my name was written in the L book
[1:02:24] of life before the foundation of the
[1:02:26] world it'll never be written there yours
[1:02:28] was
[1:02:30] too there's your will
[1:02:35] right or statement whatever you want to
[1:02:37] call a will to show you what you
[1:02:43] inherit and Jesus Christ died to bring
[1:02:47] that into
[1:02:48] being that we could have eternal
[1:02:51] life right let's read a few scriptures
[1:02:56] number
[1:02:58] eight 1 John 1:1 that which was from the
[1:03:01] beginning I like John you know John 1
[1:03:05] and and and John first John 1 was
[1:03:07] written by the same guy and what's
[1:03:09] always amaz me they start off
[1:03:13] identical John said in the beginning was
[1:03:15] the word the word was with God and the
[1:03:16] Word was God the word was made flesh and
[1:03:18] dwelt among look at what first John he
[1:03:20] said that which was from the beginning
[1:03:23] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:03:25] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[1:03:27] and our hands have handled of the word
[1:03:29] of
[1:03:31] life for the life was manifested and we
[1:03:34] have seen it and bear witness and show
[1:03:37] unto you that eternal
[1:03:41] life which was with the father and was
[1:03:44] manifested unto
[1:03:47] us that eternal
[1:03:51] life made known by Jesus
[1:03:59] Christ it was the thing that was with
[1:04:01] the father is that John 1 in the
[1:04:03] beginning was the word word was with God
[1:04:05] and the Word was
[1:04:06] God you know the word was with God and
[1:04:09] the Word was God oh that's got to be two
[1:04:11] or three he's over here saying the same
[1:04:14] thing but he's talking about eternal
[1:04:16] life go the next one John
[1:04:21] 171 these words spake Jesus and lifted
[1:04:23] up his eyes to heaven and said father
[1:04:25] the hour has come glorify thy son that
[1:04:28] thy son Also may glorify thee as thou H
[1:04:31] has given him Power Over All Flesh that
[1:04:35] he should give eternal life to as many
[1:04:39] as thou Hast given
[1:04:42] him and this is eternal
[1:04:48] life that we might Know Thee the only
[1:04:51] true God in Jesus Christ whom th have
[1:04:55] sent can I put it in this way this is
[1:04:59] eternal
[1:05:00] life to not by knowledge no
[1:05:05] God that's no more than a Rich Young
[1:05:07] Ruler walking with
[1:05:09] him but to know by Revelation who that
[1:05:13] God
[1:05:14] is is eternal
[1:05:17] life difference in a revelation and a
[1:05:20] natural right look at the next Romans 6
[1:05:23] and 23 or the wages of sin is death but
[1:05:26] the gift of God is eternal life
[1:05:30] how who released it who brought it to
[1:05:33] you through Jesus Christ Our
[1:05:36] Lord
[1:05:39] right look at the next one 1 John 2:24
[1:05:42] and
[1:05:47] 25 let that therefore abide in you which
[1:05:51] you have heard from the
[1:05:52] beginning if that which you have heard
[1:05:55] from the beginning shall remain in you
[1:05:56] you shall continue in the son and in the
[1:05:59] father and this is a promise that he has
[1:06:01] promised us even eternal
[1:06:06] life if we can get to life that was in
[1:06:11] that one we call Jesus the
[1:06:15] Flesh and we have to do that by the new
[1:06:18] birth right amen then we can have
[1:06:20] eternal life look at the next 1 John 510
[1:06:25] through1
[1:06:29] 13 uh first John 510 I we left off left
[1:06:34] off 10 I guess but it's talking about he
[1:06:36] that believeth on the Son of God ha to
[1:06:38] witness in himself and he that believeth
[1:06:40] not have not he's a liar all right watch
[1:06:42] verse 11 and this is the record that God
[1:06:45] had given to us eternal
[1:06:48] life
[1:06:51] record
[1:06:53] deed record right word Bible book
[1:06:58] Abstract title
[1:07:02] deed amen that's why it says over there
[1:07:04] in John about the record the record is
[1:07:08] that the Father the Son and the Holy
[1:07:09] Ghost
[1:07:10] is one right but the witness is water
[1:07:15] blood and spirit in your baptism they
[1:07:18] agree in one that's Bible if you want to
[1:07:20] go on over to the
[1:07:22] record watch and this is a record that
[1:07:25] God has given to us eternal life and
[1:07:28] this life is in his son he that has a
[1:07:31] son have life and he that hath not the
[1:07:33] Son of God have not life these things
[1:07:35] have I written unto you that believe on
[1:07:37] the name of the son of God that you may
[1:07:39] know that you have eternal life and that
[1:07:42] you may believe on the name of the son
[1:07:44] of God right written unto us that we may
[1:07:47] know that's
[1:07:49] it not by knowledge head but by
[1:07:52] revelation
[1:07:54] No 1 John
[1:07:59] 5:20 and we know that the Son of God has
[1:08:02] come and that's giv us an
[1:08:06] understanding watch it that we may know
[1:08:10] him that is true and we are in him that
[1:08:13] is true even in his son Jesus Christ
[1:08:17] this is the true God
[1:08:20] and eternal
[1:08:22] life
[1:08:25] not a head knowledge of knowing but a
[1:08:27] revelation that he's in your
[1:08:33] heart think on
[1:08:36] it
[1:08:38] John 10:27 and 28 my sheep hear my voice
[1:08:43] and I know them and they follow me and I
[1:08:46] give unto them eternal life and they
[1:08:49] shall never perish neither shall any man
[1:08:52] plug them out of my hand
[1:08:54] I give it to him he
[1:08:57] said look at the next one get a few
[1:09:01] scriptures Ephesians 1:13 just a few
[1:09:04] that have picked in whom all ye also
[1:09:07] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:09:09] Truth The Gospel of your salvation in
[1:09:11] whom also I after that you believed you
[1:09:14] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:09:15] Promise watch which is the earnest of
[1:09:18] our
[1:09:20] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:09:22] purchased possession under the praise of
[1:09:24] his glory you
[1:09:28] realize an
[1:09:33] Earnest now or if you'll fall back with
[1:09:36] me just a little bit and
[1:09:41] think an Earnest is only a part
[1:09:47] payment but that's the baptism of the
[1:09:49] Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost that's in your
[1:09:52] soul
[1:09:54] the other thing got to come to
[1:09:57] Redemption before you can claim your
[1:09:59] full inheritance that's what I said
[1:10:01] folks this is the will this tells me
[1:10:05] this tells me
[1:10:07] here in second Corinthians 1:22 who ha
[1:10:12] also sealed us and given us the earnest
[1:10:15] of the spirit in our
[1:10:18] hearts this tells me what get to the
[1:10:21] last one 17 1 Peter 1
[1:10:24] three blessed be the God and father of
[1:10:26] our Lord Jesus Christ according to His
[1:10:28] abundant Mercy hath begotten us again
[1:10:32] unto a lively Hope by the resurrection
[1:10:35] of Jesus Christ from the dead to an
[1:10:38] inheritance
[1:10:39] Incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth
[1:10:42] not
[1:10:43] away reserved in heaven for you amen
[1:10:47] what days we going up there
[1:10:50] no Earnest starts here Earnest starts in
[1:10:54] the soul Earnest is a baby Faith we're
[1:10:59] not born again up here the disciples got
[1:11:02] to right here in their birth that's why
[1:11:04] it's the faith of the fathers we start
[1:11:07] here that's our new birth The Headstone
[1:11:11] completes our new birth the change of
[1:11:13] the body which is what we get into
[1:11:17] Romans the adoption to it the Redemption
[1:11:21] of our
[1:11:22] body we only have the earnest of our
[1:11:27] inheritance waiting for the full
[1:11:31] inheritance and brother R said that'll
[1:11:33] take place at the resurrection now
[1:11:35] that's where he covers
[1:11:37] it but are you with
[1:11:40] me did it sound kind of
[1:11:45] strange that someone would be so
[1:11:48] illiterate to even pronounce that Jesus
[1:11:51] Christ or Jesus the flesh would inherit
[1:11:55] eternal
[1:11:57] life but do you see what happened he
[1:12:01] did now here's my life
[1:12:04] statement he inherited eternal life in
[1:12:07] flesh right are you with me right he had
[1:12:10] eternal life in his
[1:12:11] soul Soul and Spirit was eternal because
[1:12:14] it was almighty God God was in Christ
[1:12:16] reconciling the world to
[1:12:18] himself that body inherited eternal
[1:12:21] life and that body became my kinsman
[1:12:25] redeemer and you know what my kinsman
[1:12:27] redeemer can
[1:12:29] do he don't have to die
[1:12:35] again right Boaz never
[1:12:40] died to give Naomi and Ruth their
[1:12:45] inheritance Jesus Christ don't have to
[1:12:48] die
[1:12:49] again amen amen to give you and I
[1:12:52] eternal life in these bodies right
[1:12:56] that's right he's already made the way
[1:12:59] how by releasing the life that was in
[1:13:03] him that could come back into you and I
[1:13:05] and our soul and make our soul
[1:13:08] Eternal now we're in the Plan of
[1:13:11] Redemption and it being fully made
[1:13:15] manifest think on these
[1:13:20] things an
[1:13:22] inheritance
[1:13:24] of eternal life y
[1:13:29] now see if you'll follow on this
[1:13:32] second see then if you believe that that
[1:13:35] body had to inherit eternal
[1:13:38] life then you must
[1:13:41] believe that you and I would have to
[1:13:43] inherit eternal
[1:13:46] life not that we already have
[1:13:51] it yes but brother Dale you just don't
[1:13:54] make it a tantalizing I just get so
[1:13:56] excited when I hear and I get upset when
[1:13:58] I hear you preach praise God one day you
[1:14:02] will be happy and you'll tell me about
[1:14:05] it and we'll shout on the Hills of Glory
[1:14:07] but until then I don't worry about your
[1:14:09] little petty feelings and mind neither
[1:14:11] one that's right I'm trying to preach
[1:14:14] eternal
[1:14:15] life and I realize that a prophet said
[1:14:18] make it soft and they think you're
[1:14:20] trying to pull something over on
[1:14:22] them
[1:14:24] make it straight and at least you know
[1:14:26] where I
[1:14:28] stand I believe you must be born again
[1:14:32] to have eternal life in your soul and
[1:14:35] that eternal life coming in my soul
[1:14:37] then's going to make a way for this body
[1:14:40] to be
[1:14:43] redeemed you said well it was reded oh I
[1:14:47] just he you know it was redeemed back
[1:14:49] there
[1:14:50] brother it sure was but but it didn't
[1:14:54] take possession
[1:14:56] either
[1:14:58] right and just remember let me just show
[1:15:01] you how you fall into a
[1:15:03] hole you say he paid the price it was
[1:15:11] redeemed ain't took possession yet you
[1:15:16] agree well then I guess the ain't took
[1:15:18] possession of your
[1:15:22] soul
[1:15:25] did that go
[1:15:28] through if he ain't took possession of
[1:15:31] the body he might not have took
[1:15:33] possession of your soul
[1:15:36] yet remember the earnest
[1:15:41] comes in the soul
[1:15:44] first then we can talk about a bodily
[1:15:49] Redemption think on these
[1:15:51] things eternal ET
[1:15:55] life he wrote my name in the book The
[1:16:00] whe that I would and he knew that I
[1:16:03] would come to Earth because when Jesus
[1:16:05] stood as a lamb he had to come in Earth
[1:16:07] and and he knew when I
[1:16:09] came that one day I'd learn what this
[1:16:11] Bible was really
[1:16:13] about and I'd find my will written right
[1:16:16] here by his stripes I am
[1:16:22] healed right here don't have to look for
[1:16:25] another
[1:16:27] book just believe the one we got let's
[1:16:30] stand come on
[1:16:32] Brothers eternal
[1:16:36] life I'll make this life statement as
[1:16:39] they're coming eternal life is a person
[1:16:42] it's not a concept or a
[1:16:46] thought eternal life is a person it took
[1:16:50] a person to die not a concept or a
[1:16:52] thought
[1:16:53] it took a person and that person was
[1:16:55] almighty
[1:16:57] God to rip that Soul and Spirit out of
[1:17:00] that body that that body could become my
[1:17:04] kinsman redeemer to pay the price
[1:17:08] right and then like I said I don't know
[1:17:10] where you I hope you catch it
[1:17:14] then Boaz never had to
[1:17:18] die
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:23] because you can get an inheritance
[1:17:25] without your family having to pass
[1:17:30] away why can't we believe it
[1:17:34] now I have a right to preach Divine
[1:17:37] Healing I have a right to preach
[1:17:39] salvation why because my book says that
[1:17:43] I can what now brother Dale don't go too
[1:17:46] far okay we'll try not to but I

[1:17:57] that was going to be a spiritual
[1:18:00] multiplication had it not got messed
[1:18:03] up and I thought that was what we were
[1:18:05] doing now that's
[1:18:07] right right and brother brandham said
[1:18:11] the
[1:18:12] bride
