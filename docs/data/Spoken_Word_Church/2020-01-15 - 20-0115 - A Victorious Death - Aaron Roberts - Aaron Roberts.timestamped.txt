[1:31] good to be on the house of the Lord
[1:33] could be a Christian thank the Lord for
[1:38] all that he's done for us it's one thing
[1:47] there's me there's many needs and seems
[1:51] like every day you're hearing more and
[1:54] more people requesting prayer for
[1:56] different things but one thing about it
[1:59] God meets every every need you know he
[2:07] knows our needs before we pray he has an
[2:10] answer before we pray state faux-fur Oh
[2:15] God they can answer our prayers and
[2:18] knows what we have Nita and gives it to
[2:21] us and sometimes it's it gives us our
[2:27] needs and not our walls sometimes we
[2:30] don't know what we need but he does know
[2:32] what we need amen let's just all bow our
[2:35] heads and speak the lord before we get
[2:38] into the scripture we're gonna be
[2:39] reading from the book of Judges chapter
[2:41] 13 all bow our heads and pray our
[2:47] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just
[2:49] so thankful for Lord for you and for
[2:52] another opportunity to be in your house
[2:53] Lord together with your your saints Lord
[2:57] and we just so thankful for our brothers
[2:58] and sisters Lord - Lord that we can
[3:00] fellowship with Lord and father I just

[3:45] Holy Ghost to speak or what people need
[3:47] Lord or not just to be speaking from
[3:50] just speaking out of the Bible Lord

[4:09] a life Lord and we just pray that it
[4:11] becomes Lord just a continual growth
[4:13] Lord Jesus that Lord it's not us in the
[4:16] way Lord Jesus but it's more of you
[4:18] that's come on the scene or Jesus Lord
[4:21] that you just take over Lord or that
[4:23] that that the world can see Jesus Christ
[4:26] standing in flesh again Lord Jesus Lord

[4:38] too much time Lord to mention all the
[4:40] names Lord Jesus but you know each heart
[4:42] in each life Lord you know what each
[4:44] name that's been being mentioned Lord
[4:46] and Lord you know what their needs are
[4:48] and finally we know why they've
[4:51] contacted us Lord and asked for a prayer
[4:53] Lord because we know that you know that
[4:55] that we we have a communication Lord we
[4:58] have a fellowship with you Lord and it's
[5:01] and it's visible through the people

[5:26] to each one i knowing us my dalou
[5:28] blessed of the little bride around the
[5:30] world Lord for each one that has a need
[5:32] Lord nor desire as I the request came in
[5:35] from the brother Lord that was speaking
[5:37] about their needing a place to meet and
[5:39] lord we
[5:40] we know that before they even asked Lord
[5:42] JRE had a place and we just believe that
[5:44] you'll meet and just go to them and just
[5:47] bless them in a special way Lord we
[5:49] commit all things to you in the name of
[5:51] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen judges
[5:55] chapter 13 and verse 1 says and the
[6:00] children of Israel did evil again in the
[6:02] sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered
[6:03] them into the hand of the Philistines 40
[6:06] years and there was a certain man of
[6:08] Zorah of the family of the Danites whose
[6:11] name was Manoah and his wife was barren
[6:14] and barren and bare not and the angel
[6:16] the Lord appeared unto the woman and
[6:18] said unto her behold now thou art barren
[6:21] and Barriss not but thou shalt conceive
[6:24] and bear a son now therefore o beware I
[6:27] pray thee and drink not wine or strong
[6:30] drink nor eat any unclean thing for lo
[6:33] thou shalt conceive and bear a son and
[6:36] no razor shall come on his head for the
[6:39] child shall be a Nazarite unto God from
[6:42] the womb and he shall begin to deliver
[6:44] Israel out of the hands of the
[6:46] Philistines so we're gonna drop down to
[6:51] verse 24 and it says and the woman bear
[6:55] a son and called his name Sampson and
[6:57] the child grew and the Lord blessed him
[7:00] hey man god bless you tonight you can be
[7:02] seated and then we're gonna continue
[7:04] reading on in save time don't want you
[7:09] have to stay on the whole time but
[7:11] Judges chapter 16 we're just gonna
[7:14] continue on there just a few more off of
[7:18] me your scripture to you but you know I
[7:21] just want to start and lay the whole
[7:25] foundation here judges chapter 16 verse
[7:29] 23 says and the Lord's then the Lords of
[7:32] the Philistines gathered them together
[7:33] for to offer a great sacrifice unto
[7:36] Dagon their God and to rejoice for they
[7:38] said our God hath delivered sentence and
[7:40] our enemy into our hand and when the
[7:42] people saw him they praised their God
[7:44] and they said our God hath delivered
[7:46] into our hands our enemy the destroy of
[7:48] our country which slew many of us and it
[7:52] came to pass when their hearts
[7:53] marry these and they said call for
[7:56] Sampson that he may make us sport and
[7:59] they called for Sampson out of the
[8:00] prison house and he made them sport and
[8:02] they set him between the pillars and
[8:04] Sampson set unto the lab that held him
[8:08] by the hands suffer me that I may feel
[8:10] the pillars whereupon the house standeth
[8:12] that I may lean upon them now the house
[8:15] was full of men and women and all the
[8:16] Lords of the Philistines were there and
[8:18] there were upon the roof about three
[8:20] thousand men and women and beheld while
[8:22] Simpson made sport and Sampson called
[8:25] unto the Lord and said O Lord God
[8:27] remember me
[8:27] I prayed these strip than me I pray thee
[8:30] want only this once so God that I may
[8:33] may be at once avenged of the
[8:36] Philistines for my two eyes and the sand
[8:39] Sampson took hold of the two middle
[8:41] pillars which upon which the house stood
[8:44] and on which it was borne up of the - of
[8:48] the one with his right hand and of the
[8:50] other with his left and Sampson said let
[8:52] me die with the Philistines and he bowed
[8:54] himself with all of his might and the
[8:56] house fell upon the lords and upon all
[8:58] the people that were there in so the
[9:00] death which she slew at his death so the
[9:03] day at which he slew at his death were
[9:04] more than they which he slew in his life
[9:07] amen
[9:09] so tonight if you saw the title it's
[9:13] called a victory a victorious death you
[9:17] know most of the time when people think
[9:19] about a death you know most of the time
[9:24] that's not very victorious you know when
[9:28] when people think of dying and you know
[9:30] many times even when we look at things
[9:33] many poems you know it's a loss and you
[9:40] know they don't see that as being a
[9:42] victory but you know you know we see in
[9:47] Samson's life Sampson had a great
[9:50] victory but it took it took his death it
[9:54] took everything that he had and you know
[9:58] many years ago there's a there's a
[10:02] you know I've always been kind of
[10:06] partial to history I've always kind of
[10:08] liked history and there was a story that
[10:11] came out of from World War two and it's
[10:14] always stuck with me and that's one of
[10:16] my one of my favorite stories that come
[10:18] from that from the Allies and in 1943 we
[10:23] if you if you know much about the war at
[10:26] Point the Allies wanted to invade from
[10:31] North Africa they wanted to invade into
[10:33] Europe and and so one of the areas that
[10:36] they were going to have to go into was
[10:38] Italy because that was the way that they
[10:40] were going to breach in to Europe and
[10:44] when when allies had moved into the
[10:49] north and North Africa you know the not
[10:52] seasoned the Germans knew where their
[10:54] allies were headed because they knew the
[10:57] landscape and they knew where they would
[10:58] end up so that's the route they went and
[11:01] they fortified Sicily because that was
[11:04] the most logical place that you would
[11:05] bring in your troops
[11:07] well the Allies were needing that place
[11:13] for the invasion they needed to clear
[11:15] that out so they found a man that were
[11:19] that had died and this man and if you
[11:23] can read about it I I don't have his
[11:26] have his name but this man who was
[11:29] committed suicide this man felt like
[11:33] that he had he would never accomplish
[11:34] anything in his life and he killed
[11:36] himself and one of the things that he
[11:39] had was he ended up with like pneumonia
[11:43] had a lot of fluid in his lungs and
[11:45] because of that they they used his body
[11:48] the British government took his body and
[11:53] they dressed him up as a soldier and
[11:55] they as an officer and they put these
[11:57] plans and all this correspondence and
[12:00] stuff in his in his clothing and in his
[12:03] satchel and everything and they took him
[12:05] and they dropped him off of this coast
[12:06] of Spain because they knew that Spain
[12:09] was supposed to be neutral but they knew
[12:12] that they would get the information to
[12:15] the Nazis
[12:16] so they they drop this dead man out in
[12:19] the water because he had all that fluid
[12:21] in his lungs it looked like he drowned
[12:22] that's exactly what the British
[12:24] government said here's this captain in
[12:27] our in our military that had drowned and
[12:29] they took all these papers well mi5 had
[12:32] taken all the papers that he had and
[12:34] they coded them and they knew when they
[12:36] were gonna get copied well a Spanish
[12:38] took them they give them to the Nazis
[12:40] the Nazi made copy of them and give them
[12:42] back to the British the British got him
[12:44] they scanned them and they realized that
[12:45] the Nazis had made copies of the plans
[12:49] well their plan was to invade Greece and
[12:53] Sardinia they weren't going to and so a
[12:56] lie started moving their forces to the
[12:59] right place
[13:00] Hitler was convinced that they had left
[13:03] Sicily they had scrapped the the
[13:06] invasion of Sicily they were going to go
[13:09] a different way
[13:10] well Hitler had numerous generals kept
[13:15] telling him this is a bad plan but
[13:18] Hitler was convinced this was right so
[13:21] he went over there and moved all his
[13:22] forces to the right spot and when the
[13:25] time come the Americans and the Allies
[13:29] invaded Sicily and the thing is is it
[13:32] cleared it out we'd almost less people
[13:35] when we invaded Sicily because the plan
[13:37] had worked and they had moved all of the
[13:39] forces out of the way
[13:41] but you know it was so amazing and you
[13:44] say why are you telling it you know but
[13:46] what was so amazing about this was they
[13:48] took a man and this man who in his whole
[13:53] entire life this man didn't believe that
[13:56] he could ever accomplish anything
[13:58] here's a man that that killed himself
[14:01] and he didn't think he had anything to
[14:03] live for but you know what happened when
[14:05] he died he became extremely valuable to
[14:09] the deliverance of Europe but the
[14:11] problem was he never saw that but you
[14:14] know what it took it took his death to
[14:16] get him out of the way so that he could
[14:18] be used for a greater plan and you and I
[14:22] brothers and sisters the thing is is I
[14:24] want us to understand that sometimes
[14:25] that's what he takes it takes a
[14:27] for us to get out of the way because
[14:29] what holds up the plan of God is us
[14:32] getting out of the way and here's this
[14:35] man who never felt like he'd ever
[14:36] accomplished anything in his life but
[14:38] you know what he done when he died they
[14:40] were able to use him to take a message
[14:43] a message to be delivered to the people
[14:47] and you know what the scripture tells us
[14:49] that that this is a message of
[14:52] deliverance but to others it's a message
[14:54] of damnation they were going to take
[14:57] this and they're not going to believe it
[14:59] they're going to do whatever they will
[15:01] with it but the message would will
[15:03] accomplish exactly what it was sent for
[15:05] the message was sent to and in the the
[15:09] message came that it was going to be in
[15:11] deliverance but you know what to those
[15:15] who it's damnation its damnation but to
[15:18] those who are it's deliverance it's
[15:20] deliverance to those that it's eternal
[15:22] life its eternal life but here's this
[15:29] man who didn't think he would do
[15:30] anything but you know what would he died
[15:32] he was able to be used and you know what
[15:34] many people think you know what can I do
[15:36] my life is like it's so low and so
[15:39] insignificant it doesn't really amount
[15:41] to anything but you know what if you'll
[15:43] ever died out to Jesus Christ and let
[15:45] him come on the scene and let him it's
[15:47] no longer either but it's Christ that
[15:49] liveth in me then you can see miracles
[15:52] take place you can see the supernatural
[15:55] people want to know where the
[15:56] supernatural is well you know what he
[15:57] takes place in humans and just everyday
[16:01] living and God comes on the scene and
[16:03] he'll meet you well because it's not a
[16:07] public show people come to church God
[16:16] come to speak someone and people get
[16:18] delivers and people get held and the
[16:19] next one sits there like a bump on a
[16:21] pickle and they don't get anything but
[16:25] see God come on the scene but he's here
[16:28] to meet your needs to do to give
[16:30] whatever you have need of and here in
[16:35] there in our scripture we see Samson
[16:37] Samson was born to be a deliverer
[16:41] Samson was born with a perp he was born
[16:44] with a commission he was prophesied to
[16:50] do something and you know my brothers
[16:54] and sisters we work - this is from the
[17:03] message just once more Lord 1963 I think
[17:09] is number one brother Browns speaking he
[17:13] says you brought this to my memory of
[17:16] this great man that wants to live for
[17:18] you in the condition he got in the
[17:20] fatherís Samson was willing to die die
[17:21] out to himself died with his enemy to
[17:24] bring God's victory and promise back
[17:26] mamie with all our church entity and all
[17:29] our difference doubts our own thinking
[17:31] and accept your word die out to the
[17:33] thoughts that we've been told the days
[17:36] of miracles and it's past that when we
[17:39] know that the that Jesus is the same
[17:42] yesterday today and forever so we can
[17:46] you know for us to die out to our own
[17:49] thinking that we can come and realize
[17:51] that God is the same yesterday today and
[17:53] forever to bring forth God's victory
[17:56] because you know that's what that's what
[17:58] Samson was to do Samson was purposed in
[18:02] life to have a purpose because the
[18:05] scripture tells us that when the when
[18:06] the forty years that the Philistines
[18:09] that Israel was in the hands of the
[18:10] Philistines that God sent them a
[18:13] deliverer to come on the scene and he
[18:15] was supposed to raise up and he was
[18:18] supposed to destroy the Philistines he
[18:20] was supposed to overcome them and you
[18:23] know and he was given this commission
[18:25] and all the things that God done in his
[18:27] life you know what he he had a covenant
[18:30] with God and he had the power to do the
[18:33] things that God called him to do but the
[18:35] problem was he never got to the place
[18:37] that he was completely sold out to God
[18:40] that he would that God was totally able
[18:42] to use him and he failed in what he was
[18:44] doing but it took a but it took his
[18:46] death to come to the great victory that
[18:48] he was warning that God purposed to him
[18:51] and brothers and sisters we have been we
[18:53] have been purposed
[18:54] - a great victory in our our we've been
[18:56] given a great Commission in our our
[18:58] we've been given this commission you
[19:00] because as the scripture tells us you
[19:02] know we're to go into all the world and
[19:05] preach the gospel to everything to each
[19:07] one because we're supposed to
[19:09] demonstrate the power that's in the
[19:11] scripture to everyone why because Jesus
[19:14] came in flesh to do exactly that and he
[19:17] said he said whatever I do you shall do
[19:20] also and greater than this how you do so
[19:23] he came and he demonstrated to us and he
[19:26] talked about even in the Garden of
[19:27] Gethsemane and when when he was tempted
[19:29] even even in the wilderness when he was
[19:30] tempted by the devil he showed that he
[19:32] could overcome by the word and he said
[19:35] he'd give that to the weakness Christian
[19:37] because even the weakest Christian could
[19:39] do the exact same thing take the exact
[19:41] same word and overcome the devil well
[19:44] because he's seen that take place before
[19:48] and you know what you and I've been
[19:50] given that same Commission to do the
[19:51] same thing to overcome the devil to
[19:55] overcome every power of the enemy in
[19:57] this hour here's a great man you know
[20:01] because lots of lots of times we don't
[20:04] think and we have to come to this
[20:06] realization you know because sometimes
[20:08] we're gonna wake their selves they shake
[20:10] ourselves every day to realize who we
[20:12] are because we allow we allowed that
[20:17] Satan to come and he and he wants to
[20:19] take a route and in our lives and take
[20:21] hold in our lives and he wants to squat
[20:24] be a squatter on our property and
[20:26] sometimes we allow him to do it you know
[20:30] you know as brother Evan was talking
[20:32] about Samson he said you all Samson's
[20:34] life he became such a great man that we
[20:37] rose up he said y'all he put fear in the
[20:39] hearts of the flesh States just at the
[20:41] mention of his name they just mentioned
[20:45] Sam says they people feared him they
[20:48] didn't won't have anything to do with
[20:49] him but you know what he was the one
[20:52] because he was fortified behind the word
[20:55] he was fortified behind a promise a
[20:58] covenant that God had given him and you
[21:00] know what you and our same thing we're
[21:02] weird fortified behind
[21:04] the world we're fortified behind the
[21:05] Covenant that God has given us and
[21:08] brothers and sisters as long as we stay
[21:09] behind that word there's nothing that
[21:11] can overcome us but you know the problem
[21:14] is is we don't were just like Samson
[21:15] sometimes we don't mind getting a little
[21:17] worldliness in or little things move and
[21:20] getting getting a little wax in our
[21:23] inner and our Christian walk and our
[21:25] Christian experience and we don't have
[21:27] the fervor and we don't have the zeal as
[21:29] as brother Wade was talking about we're
[21:31] lacking these things in what the devil
[21:33] is allowed to be allowed to creep in and
[21:37] it all of a sudden we wonder why we
[21:39] don't have the victory while we don't
[21:40] have Joel wonder while these things like
[21:42] why because we've allowed it to happen
[21:49] because as brother Branham was talking
[21:52] about you can imagine you know having a
[21:54] great big bank account and having lots
[21:58] of money and if people walk around
[22:01] wonder about you know how am I going to
[22:03] pay my bills or how about you know how
[22:05] am I going to eat you know what are we
[22:07] gonna do well you know I don't know
[22:14] about y'all but you know my boys you
[22:16] know they don't know my one bit coming
[22:18] to me daddy and it's just you know they
[22:27] don't they don't mind one bit got them
[22:31] hands up but you know what there's
[22:35] people there's people well lord if it be
[22:37] your wheel well let's see God put it in
[22:42] the word that he said that he that he
[22:45] Paul said that he prayed that you'd
[22:47] prosper and be in health even as your
[22:49] soul prospers he said my God shall
[22:52] supply all your needs according to his
[22:54] riches in glory because what the
[22:56] scripture said Haven said prove me and
[22:59] try me and say if I won't open the
[23:01] windows of heaven David tells us that he
[23:05] heals all our sin our diseases and all
[23:10] of our afflictions he's forgiven all of
[23:12] our sins and our iniquities so you know
[23:16] what we have been forgiven
[23:18] but you know what it's there for us
[23:21] because that's a great big bank account
[23:23] that great in solve inexhaustible
[23:26] fountain of life their brother Bram
[23:29] talks about that you you know that
[23:31] little fish you know well you know I may
[23:33] have to drink sparingly I may run out or
[23:39] you had this great big bank account well
[23:41] that you have all these things well you
[23:42] know he said it's a he said it's a bank
[23:44] draft of heaven you know what he said he
[23:49] said it's all he's got everything he
[23:51] owns the cattle on a Thousand Hill all
[23:53] day all things were created by him and
[23:55] were for him and he said it was his good
[23:59] pleasure to give you the kingdom to give
[24:02] you all that you have need of and we
[24:04] wonder the Lord is this your wheel you
[24:10] know sometimes you have to sit and think
[24:12] you know if I had a need there's people
[24:15] I know I know brother Dale would give me
[24:16] anything that I did if he could help me
[24:18] and he knew I was in need he'd give me
[24:20] everything that he had he'd do anything
[24:23] he could for me but you know what he's a
[24:26] man hey so but you know how much greater
[24:28] is our Heavenly Father when we well he
[24:31] knows everything that you have Nita
[24:32] before you even ask for it he knows what
[24:35] you have need of and you know what he's
[24:36] already got it planned out you know what
[24:39] he David said I've never seen the
[24:41] righteous forsaken or his seed begging
[24:43] bread you know he's never failed us and
[24:46] as you know if you go back through your
[24:48] life and you sit down and you think you
[24:49] know you need to you need to sit down
[24:51] and write down the things that God has
[24:53] done for you the things that you've seen
[24:54] God do in your life you know you need to
[24:56] hang that on the wall and look at it
[24:58] sometimes you know because sometimes if
[25:00] you start down and start it right now
[25:01] you start down writing down all your
[25:03] problems everything that you got wrong
[25:05] and everything and you start writing
[25:06] down all your blessings and all the
[25:07] things God done for you then you know
[25:09] what all of a sudden you don't think
[25:10] about the problems that you got you're
[25:12] all of a sudden it's like what do I have
[25:13] over here because you know what you're
[25:15] still writing all the blessings and all
[25:16] the things got into all the miracles
[25:18] that you've seen done in your life over
[25:19] here but you know what sometimes all we
[25:20] do is focus on the problems we always
[25:23] focus on this side over here we say you
[25:25] know what are you gonna do
[25:26] and then we worry about all this over
[25:27] you know what God's done all this for us
[25:32] well if he's done all that you know what
[25:34] he's gonna take care of the rest of it
[25:35] too you know because if God has given us
[25:41] eternal life if he's giving us the
[25:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost if we're born
[25:45] again and we're of the seed of God and
[25:47] we are the children of God and we are we
[25:50] are Jesus Christ on the earth then you
[25:52] know what whatever he has according to
[25:54] the scripture
[25:55] we're joint heirs with Christ whatever
[25:57] Christ has we have also so you know what
[26:00] it's not like you know we're having to
[26:02] worry about it and try to struggle and
[26:03] press all these things why because it's
[26:05] already there but the problem is is
[26:08] we're just like Samson many times we get
[26:10] in our own way we're always getting in
[26:12] the way of God we don't surrender to him
[26:14] and say Lord come on the scene and just
[26:16] have your will in your way because we
[26:18] want to do it the way that we want to do
[26:20] it we want it to happen the way that we
[26:22] want to happen and if you don't come my
[26:25] way and if it don't just stroke me just
[26:27] the right way just like a catch you know
[26:29] padding it padding it and pending we
[26:32] don't go the right way you know we get
[26:33] all upset but you know what that's what
[26:38] God wants us to do he wants us to grow
[26:40] up and be rugged Christians he wants us
[26:42] to be people that can stand our own feet
[26:50] not be little babies we let our we let
[27:00] our vision we let our things that happen
[27:04] to us hold us back Luke chapter 10 verse
[27:11] 19 says Jesus speaking he says behold I
[27:14] give you power to tread on serpents and
[27:16] scorpions and over all the power of the
[27:19] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[27:22] hurt you so he's given you the power
[27:25] over all the powers of the enemy so you
[27:28] know what he's already defeated when it
[27:31] before he even comes to bring to attack
[27:33] you to even try to come against you he's
[27:35] already defeated
[27:36] he's already because he's already
[27:38] defeated one because we have the word
[27:41] but the problem is is we don't we don't
[27:43] believe that we don't believe that he's
[27:46] already defeated you know it's just like
[27:50] you know if you if you had something you
[27:54] know you say these people is that's got
[27:57] property or whatever you know and they
[27:59] they know it's theirs and they've got a
[28:01] claim on it you know what they don't
[28:02] mind well you know I should say this
[28:05] some people will let people just walk
[28:08] all over them and take everything they
[28:10] got and they don't they just go and
[28:12] smile but there's other people in the
[28:13] world you know what if it belongs to
[28:15] them and you got it you better get going
[28:18] because you know what they're coming to
[28:20] get it
[28:21] if you got it next thing you know
[28:23] they're calling the law and they bring
[28:26] their they bring their their papers and
[28:28] they bring their court orders and
[28:31] everything and they don't mind walking
[28:32] down there and say listen Jack that's
[28:33] mine and you got to go and the officers
[28:37] are right here
[28:38] they will help you leave this property
[28:39] or they will drag you off kicking and
[28:41] screaming but you're gone and you know
[28:45] what that's what you have to do to the
[28:46] devil when he comes your way you can
[28:48] stand out there and hold the word up and
[28:50] say you know what you got no place to be
[28:52] here you've got no right to be here you
[28:54] are defeated you've got no place to be
[28:56] here here's the word and the Holy Ghost
[28:57] is sent to enforce the word he's the he
[29:02] is the enforcer so if the word has been
[29:04] given to us then you know what he's got
[29:05] to go but you know what you've got to
[29:07] claim that and believe that and stand
[29:09] there and can and be convinced of it
[29:12] until he leaves but you know what if we
[29:15] just stand here one time and say well by
[29:17] a stripes I'm healed and then all of a
[29:19] sudden you know when it gets worse and
[29:21] we don't get healed and we're okay for a
[29:23] while and then it comes back there's
[29:24] like well I guess I wasn't healed no you
[29:27] know what you got to kick that devil out
[29:29] again if he comes along one time he
[29:31] don't mind trying to come back but you
[29:34] know what if he filled you one time then
[29:36] you know what he can hear you again you
[29:38] always was heal but you know he'll keep
[29:39] coming back and all of a sudden you know
[29:41] you go to the doctor and everything
[29:42] looks good one month and the next time
[29:44] you go back the next month and
[29:45] everything looks bad well you know what
[29:46] God's Word didn't change the doctors
[29:48] test might have changed but God's Word
[29:50] didn't change what he said about you is
[29:52] still the same so if he
[29:54] said you is healed no matter what the
[29:55] test says you're still healed that devil
[29:59] still defeated if we can just believe
[30:06] what God said you know as as Samson
[30:11] here's a great man giving this Great
[30:15] Commission to defeat this enemy that had
[30:19] bound and harass the people of God all
[30:23] those years and you know he was given a
[30:24] Great Commission to overcome and you
[30:26] know what and he was able to he was able
[30:29] to do great feats through the strength
[30:31] of God and and seem to all the miracles
[30:33] that had happened in his life and all
[30:35] those things but you know what it didn't
[30:36] come to the place that it ought to have
[30:39] because he did not do what he was
[30:41] supposed to do because it was a thing
[30:43] that he was supposed to do and that was
[30:45] to overcome all the powers of the enemy
[30:48] but he didn't because he wanted to do
[30:51] his own thing and you know as he went
[30:53] along you know God was able to do a lot
[30:55] of great things to his life but you know
[30:56] what there came a time then when it came
[30:58] to the greatest battle he'd failed
[31:00] because he didn't stay with where he
[31:02] should have been you know there's when
[31:05] he came along you know there was Delilah
[31:10] you know we seen all the things that had
[31:13] happened in his life but you know what
[31:14] he got to a place in his life where you
[31:17] know what he was supposed to stay away
[31:19] from the enemy but you know what hail
[31:22] out he allowed the enemy to come in the
[31:26] enemy was able to come in for a little
[31:27] bit and and she was able to do her thing
[31:30] she was able to work her charms and you
[31:33] know he was in hey Lenny listen to what
[31:36] she had to say but you know what he
[31:38] should have never had anything to do
[31:40] with and here it was you know he'd seen
[31:48] all that they had done you know
[31:54] when you see that when you see the devil
[31:58] you know and you try to picture this
[32:02] here's here's that here's the people of
[32:05] God here's here's Israel and here they
[32:09] are being killed and and all the things
[32:12] that they had to go through under the
[32:13] bondage of the Philistines all those
[32:15] years and you know ever since Samson was
[32:19] young he was told you're gonna be the
[32:21] deliverer you know here you're God's
[32:23] anointed you to do something you know he
[32:27] was called to this and you know what no
[32:30] doubt he had seen the destruction he had
[32:33] seen the damage that the Philistines had
[32:36] done and yet he didn't he didn't stay
[32:40] away from it when you see what what the
[32:44] destruction and all the things that the
[32:46] devil has done to you when you've seen
[32:49] how many things that went wrong in your
[32:50] life and all these things and you know
[32:52] what and you still don't mind him
[32:53] sitting on your shoulder talking in your
[32:55] ear and here he was and when all of this
[32:58] was going on
[32:59] and here Samson was when he knew to stay
[33:02] away from that you're supposed to
[33:04] utterly destroy that but you know what
[33:06] he came along brother Bram said you know
[33:10] here was Delilah bringing her you know
[33:12] her whilst good looking woman come along
[33:14] you know turned his head well he didn't
[33:17] mind hanging out with her but you know
[33:21] what that was his problem he had a
[33:23] pretty face and she could talk to him
[33:25] the right way and Stroke him just the
[33:28] right way and he just he just was
[33:30] infatuated he was just in love and he
[33:32] just just just brought him right to the
[33:35] place you know and you know what he had
[33:39] he had a commission he had a secret
[33:42] nobody knew where he strength loved he
[33:46] had a strength from God he had a
[33:48] covenant from God God had given him a
[33:52] word to hold on to and yet do you know
[33:57] that when Delilah came to him he played
[34:01] it off like it was a joke like it was
[34:06] just like it was just a
[34:08] joke after he'd seen all the destruction
[34:11] and mayhem and everything that the
[34:14] Philistines had done to the children of
[34:16] Israel and knowing he was the one to
[34:18] destroy them to destroy the works of the
[34:22] enemy and you know what if we say God
[34:27] has called us to destroy the works of
[34:29] the enemy he's called you to destroy the
[34:32] works of the enemy you know what when
[34:36] there's there's there's sickness did not
[34:38] come from God there there's no sickness

[42:30] along and just rocks him to sleep and
[42:33] he's lost all zeal and he's lost all
[42:37] sincerity he's lost all consideration
[42:40] for the word of God
[42:41] and he sits there and he lays in her lap
[42:43] and she just begins to work and there
[42:49] goes his power falling on the floor
[42:56] and you know what young people you can
[43:00] do that God's called you to do great
[43:04] feats in this world you know what you
[43:06] don't have you don't have to go out and
[43:07] and do their things that we've we've all
[43:10] done that there's a lot of things in our
[43:13] lives
[43:14] that you know we would hate to have to
[43:16] stand up here and tell anybody but you
[43:20] know what there's a lot of things that
[43:21] y'all don't have to do but you know what
[43:23] you'll make that decision whether you'll
[43:25] do it or not whether you'll overcome it
[43:28] and say you know what I didn't I never
[43:29] touched those things I never saw those
[43:32] things I've never partook of those
[43:34] things and you what you can stand up and
[43:38] you can testify saying you know what the
[43:40] grace of God's kept me the grace of God
[43:43] has kept me to this place that I've been
[43:45] able to overcome it's not me but but God
[43:47] has given me a commission to overcome
[43:49] these things but you know we can't we
[43:52] can just do what we want to and just
[43:54] come out but you know what all of a
[43:55] sudden here was here's what Simpson you
[44:00] know Sampson run for a long time doing
[44:02] what he wanted to and you know he you
[44:04] know anytime something happened you know
[44:05] he could just spill the anointing just
[44:07] come overi me but just so anointed and
[44:09] then he could just do whatever he wanted
[44:11] to but you know what one day you lost
[44:15] that anointing and he was standing there
[44:17] and Delilah said Samson Samson the
[44:20] Philistines be upon you was like well
[44:22] you know what I'll just raise up take
[44:25] care of them well you know what when
[44:30] that happened he was bound here he was
[44:34] bound and his eyes plucked out can you
[44:41] imagine a man that had been feared by
[44:46] these people had been able to do great
[44:48] amazing feats in his life had the power
[44:51] of God resting upon him and had having
[44:54] the Commission to destroy these people
[44:56] and all of a sudden here is Samson the
[45:00] great deliverer bound and being drugged
[45:03] through the streets bleed
[45:07] here yes can't see and all of a sudden
[45:10] here he goes dragging down the road
[45:14] hey Sampson we got a little thing for
[45:16] you over here we want you to grind some
[45:20] meal and here goes Sampson just pushing
[45:25] that thing around and around and around
[45:27] and around and around sitting there
[45:29] thinking about you know what if I'd
[45:33] listened to the word I wouldn't be in
[45:34] this mess I wouldn't be here Here I am
[45:38] just going around doing the enemy's work
[45:44] when I could be out doing what God
[45:47] called me to do but I'm out doing the
[45:49] enemy's work and you know what no doubt
[45:53] hey they didn't mind coming by every so
[45:56] often and you know harassing him could
[46:02] you imagine here you are just grinding
[46:04] along bound can't see and all of a
[46:08] sudden somebody comes behind kicks you
[46:14] somebody poked you with a stick kids
[46:18] over there there you are out grinding
[46:20] the kids out there throwing rocks at you
[46:21] hoho
[46:22] there's the great liver oh and you know
[46:27] what he listened to that the whole time
[46:29] and you know what he began to think
[46:32] about all the things that God had called
[46:34] him to do all the great feats that he
[46:36] had had in his life all the miracles all
[46:39] the things that God had called him to do
[46:41] and all the things he did be able to do
[46:42] and all the things that he couldn't do
[46:44] because he got in this mess but you know
[46:48] what the scripture tells us that the
[46:50] hair began to grow you know that
[46:53] covenant began to come back you know
[46:56] we've become to grow out again and here
[46:58] they are making fun of me making sport
[47:01] of him you know
[47:03] here they are they built this great
[47:04] temple this this great building to their
[47:09] great God Dagon oh look we've God Dagon
[47:12] has delivered this great enemy of ours
[47:15] to us and here we are and we're going to
[47:17] get drunk and we're gonna have fun and
[47:20] we're going to make
[47:20] sport of him and we're gonna make fun of
[47:23] him and we're going to make him do all
[47:24] kinds of tricks and everything and we're
[47:25] gonna throw stuff at him and we're just
[47:27] gonna have a great time making fun of
[47:31] him but you know there's one thing about
[47:35] it if you're a child of God if you're
[47:41] one of his then you know what it doesn't
[47:44] matter if you fall or not you know what
[47:48] God is still a God of mercy he's still a
[47:52] God of grace but you know what here he
[47:56] come to the lowest point in his life and
[47:58] and you know Kent can you imagine if you
[48:00] were an Israelite and here is this great
[48:03] deliverer and you've seen Sampson come
[48:05] out there and he's done all of these
[48:06] great miracles and he's seen all these
[48:08] great feats take place and you've seen
[48:10] all these people that has harassed your
[48:12] family and your grandmother and your
[48:14] grandfather's been through all these
[48:16] things and you've seen all the things
[48:17] that the Philistines have done to them
[48:19] and all of a sudden you've seen this
[48:20] deliverer come along and then all of a
[48:22] sudden the deliverer is blind and he's
[48:25] been beat and he's being drug around by
[48:28] the Philistines and you think what
[48:30] happened
[48:33] why did what happened to our great
[48:35] deliverer god I thought God sent us this
[48:37] person I thought God sent us somebody to
[48:39] overcome these things you know what it's
[48:43] not it's not you you just you don't
[48:44] affect you somebody you know you don't
[48:46] send by yourself it's you know because
[48:48] you affect everybody else you know what
[48:51] no man's an island you know all the way
[48:55] through the scripture we see different
[48:57] ones and you know they all had they the
[49:02] you know they thought they could just do
[49:04] a little something they thought
[49:05] everything would be all right
[49:10] but you know what it don't work that way
[49:14] just ask just look in the Bible this ask
[49:17] Aiken has Aikens family you know hey no
[49:22] we're gonna want this this little bit of
[49:24] gold miss Gore it'll be okay okay no you
[49:27] know what they took all of them out then
[49:29] he just kill him they killed his family
[49:30] they burn everything up they destroyed
[49:32] all of it they got all of that
[49:35] wickedness out of the camp and do you
[49:39] think you just come along you think
[49:40] you're just gonna stand no you know what
[49:41] you're gonna affect everybody else just
[49:46] like brother Brennan or brother Dale
[49:47] always tells us one when we have a child
[49:50] as dedicated you know you level off and
[49:52] it's just ain't you doing things wrong
[49:54] you know what you're living before other
[49:55] people and you're and they're seeing the
[49:57] life that you live and you know what
[50:02] you know I got if I point one finger I
[50:06] got three more ten at me but you know
[50:11] what that's the truth our children see
[50:15] our lives and whatever we do they see
[50:19] that and they know how we live and you
[50:25] know what that's the reason you know you
[50:26] know I apologize to mine you know what
[50:31] because you know I don't I don't live a
[50:32] perfect life
[50:33] I got faults and failures just like
[50:36] everybody else and you know what they
[50:37] say well don't look too good to me I
[50:39] know it does and you know we have to
[50:42] make that right right but you know what
[50:48] they was they making out there making
[50:52] fun of Sampson all the great things that
[50:58] Simpson had done this great deliverer of
[51:00] God had come along and here he was
[51:02] standing there and oh this is what you
[51:06] call a great deliverer oh then you call
[51:09] this great we just out here making fun
[51:12] of him he can't do nothing now but you
[51:16] know what that hair had grown back and
[51:19] you know what he said Lord he said just
[51:22] once more just give me this strength
[51:24] more time they said as it was before let
[51:28] it be this one time Lord just come back
[51:31] one more time why because Lord you see
[51:34] these people that have raised up and
[51:37] they're worshipping this false God
[51:39] saying that he's got victory over you
[51:41] but Lord if it takes if it takes and it
[51:44] kills me Lord let me destroy every bit
[51:46] of this and know that that the word can
[51:49] be proclaimed that you have overcome all
[51:52] of this and you know he come walking in
[51:56] there and they thought well you know
[51:57] what he can't do nothing well you know
[52:00] what they missed the fact that the
[52:02] Covenant was back and you know what he
[52:04] prayed to God and God give him the
[52:06] strength back God gave him his anointing
[52:09] back and all of a sudden he came in
[52:11] there and you know what he had a desire
[52:13] to destroy all the works of the enemy
[52:15] but you know what it took his death to
[52:17] overcome that and he walked right out
[52:19] there and he grabbed a hold of those
[52:20] pillars and you know what he gave a show
[52:23] but you know what he won't because he
[52:25] had a desire to overcome every ounce of
[52:28] that he wanted to overcome all that the
[52:30] devil had destroyed in his life and you
[52:32] know what he grabbed a hold of that
[52:33] thing and he came again to push and he
[52:35] began to push and he pushed and he
[52:37] pushed those pillars down and it all
[52:39] fell and he killed him and he killed all
[52:41] of them so that the scripture says that
[52:43] more were killed at his death and in his
[52:44] life he destroyed more he destroyed the
[52:46] works to the enemy but you know what his
[52:48] brothers and sisters we have a great
[52:51] enemy that kind of that is before us and
[52:53] you know it's trying to take over us
[52:56] what and you know the thing is is all
[52:58] the works of the enemy because but you
[52:59] know what greater is he that sent us and
[53:01] he that's in the world
[53:03] you don't want it's Satan realizes he's
[53:05] only got a little time to work and you
[53:07] know he's going he's going to oppress
[53:09] why because this is the hour that the
[53:11] pressure would be applied to the bride
[53:13] but you know what the thing is is as the
[53:15] pressure is being applied to you you
[53:17] just be just like Samson and you get
[53:19] ahold of that you push back and you push
[53:21] back wherever is where the devil's
[53:23] attacking you then you push why because
[53:25] God's giving you anointing to push to
[53:28] break the powers of the enemy but you
[53:30] know what you stand behind the word and
[53:32] he'll give you the place and he'll tell
[53:33] you what to do why because he said the
[53:35] word of truth
[53:36] lead you and guide you and he would give
[53:39] you the overcoming but you've got to
[53:40] stand there and say Lord give it to me
[53:42] Lord led me leave me to the place that I
[53:45] can be an overcomer just like you'd have
[53:48] me to be in order that's not my ideas
[53:51] it's not my thoughts it's not my
[53:53] feelings old buddy short word give me
[53:55] your word lord give me revelation of the
[53:57] word many people have failed on that
[54:02] they don't realize well you know how to
[54:03] press sin they don't even know
[54:05] understand it you know people have
[54:07] gotten away from even even preaching the
[54:09] new birth and expressing anything that
[54:11] you know is just you know just haphazard
[54:14] and walking along blindly but God stir
[54:18] something up inside of us that we can
[54:20] come to the place there I understand
[54:21] where we need to be and what we need to
[54:23] do you know what because I know I don't
[54:29] want to have that then we'll have one
[54:30] foot hole I don't want him to have a a
[54:32] toenail on in anything I want I want it
[54:35] because God raised me up God annoying me
[54:38] God stir me up to the place that I don't
[54:40] want to have one inkling I don't want to
[54:41] have one place I don't want having
[54:43] anything of the devil I don't want to
[54:45] have any power of the enemy holding me
[54:47] back why because he's given me the
[54:50] freedom he's giving me the word to make
[54:53] me free and make me free indeed that's
[54:55] what I want to be I want to be free I
[54:57] want to be exactly what he's called me
[54:58] to be and you know what you say well
[55:03] brother brother and I failed we don't
[55:04] want God's giving us a word he's giving
[55:07] us a place that you can overcome one
[55:09] because he doesn't matter because he's
[55:12] amazed oh no God of grace he's a God of
[55:14] forgiveness and you know what the blood
[55:17] still flows and let me tell you
[55:19] something brother sisters if there's
[55:20] still a stirring inside of you then
[55:22] there's a god that's the responding to
[55:24] that can respond to that people people
[55:28] want to get all right you wonder if
[55:29] they've gone too far you know what
[55:30] sometimes you'll realize you ain't going
[55:32] far enough you've got a gun you've not
[55:40] gone too far
[55:41] to keep God away from you God standing
[55:43] there and God speaking to you that you
[55:45] can reach out and accept God and you can
[55:47] take his forgiveness and you
[55:49] take the blood and you can cover it and
[55:50] allow him to remove all that and put it
[55:52] in the sea of forgetfulness that he can
[55:55] touch you and give you exactly what you
[55:56] have need of to overcome but the
[55:58] question is are you going to press are
[56:00] you going to stand there say Lord bring
[56:02] me to the place that I can press that I
[56:04] can overcome the enemy that all the
[56:06] powers are the enemies that have been
[56:07] stand in front of me that have held me
[56:09] back we're all probably in front of me
[56:12] are you waiting for a great victory are
[56:17] you waiting for somebody else to have it
[56:20] I'm not waiting on brother Dale to give
[56:23] me my great victory I'm not waiting on
[56:25] somebody else to give me my great
[56:26] victory
[56:27] why because God's called me to come to
[56:29] this great victory God's calling me to
[56:31] the word to give me the overcoming power
[56:35] then it's me it's me that has to
[56:37] overcome I've got to overcome myself I
[56:40] gotta overcome my feelings and my doubts
[56:43] and everything well because I just got a
[56:45] limit the word says if I look like a
[56:48] failure if it looks like I've lost
[56:50] everything within you know what I'm
[56:52] still going to hold on and if God sends
[56:54] me to hell you know what I'm gonna still
[56:55] hold on to the word I'm gonna stay right
[57:00] there are we gonna no we're just going
[57:05] to start to fall away just like
[57:07] everybody else so many people have
[57:12] walked in this message for all these
[57:13] years stood up and proclaimed all this
[57:15] and all of a sudden they're off to the
[57:17] side they're blinded grinding on the
[57:23] Philistines wheel but you know what
[57:30] we've been given a great victory and you
[57:36] know what it takes it takes you dying
[57:38] out Lord let us die out to ourselves to
[57:43] our thinking Lord as Sampson was let's
[57:48] just destroy everything
[57:50] Oh Lord give us that power that we can
[57:54] overcome you know because there's a time
[57:57] God's called a group of people in this
[58:01] hour
[58:02] did you know what they're going to
[58:04] overcome every power of the enemy even
[58:06] death
[58:08] there will be a group that won't even
[58:10] have to see death why because every
[58:12] power the enemy's already defeated
[58:13] they're going to come to that place
[58:15] where he's defeated you know what and
[58:19] you have you have that ability God's
[58:22] giving it to a man god bless you tonight
[58:25] let's stay on how the musicians come you
[58:29] know where we are
[58:31] an overcomer and i don't know what i
[58:39] don't know what key it's gonna be in but
[58:41] i want to sing that song we've been made
[58:43] more than conquerors over comers in this
[58:46] life we are made victorious through the
[58:53] blood of jesus christ because God has
[58:57] made us victorious God has called us to
[58:59] that place and don't let the things that
[59:07] happen in your past hold you back you
[59:11] know because the things that we've had
[59:14] in the past it's time to put them in the
[59:18] past whatever has happened you know we
[59:22] need to come to a place that we we get a
[59:24] revelation that the things that we've
[59:28] we've confessed and we've put under the
[59:31] blood they're still there they're still
[59:34] covered and you know what God don't hold
[59:36] them don't don't remember those things
[59:38] God don't hold them against us anymore
[59:40] you know we're free and clear of all of
[59:42] that then you know what we shouldn't be
[59:44] worrying about them we shouldn't be
[59:45] thinking about them we shouldn't be
[59:47] dueling on why because God's not
[59:49] dwelling on them God's not thinking
[59:50] about them Gus I'll hold them over your
[59:52] head but you know what we do you know
[59:56] what if you fail you know what everybody
[59:57] else does too you know what we're all
[1:00:01] human we've all had Fell's and faults
[1:00:03] and failures you know what we're always
[1:00:04] gonna have faults and failures I mean
[1:00:07] we're always gonna have problems y'all
[1:00:08] won't have to but you know what it's you
[1:00:10] going to keep continue overcoming them
[1:00:12] right
[1:00:14] you know why he's giving us the ability
[1:00:16] to overcome them
[1:00:19] you know if you if if you have if you
[1:00:22] have a problem and you keep having to
[1:00:24] deal with the same thing and you keep
[1:00:26] going to the same thing then you know
[1:00:27] that's the time that you need to sit
[1:00:29] down and get fortified behind the word
[1:00:32] and get to the place that you overcome
[1:00:34] that because you know sometimes people
[1:00:38] get to the place well you know I I've
[1:00:40] dealt with this for so long I guess I'll
[1:00:41] always have that right well if you if
[1:00:44] you want that you always have it or you
[1:00:48] can come the place where you overcome it
[1:00:56] well we'll try we've been made more than
[1:01:06] car
