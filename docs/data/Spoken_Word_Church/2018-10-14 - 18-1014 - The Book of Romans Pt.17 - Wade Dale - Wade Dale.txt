========================================

they're so uh-huh here we go well I wanted on here more than me but I'm gonna stand right here that's what I was trying to trying to say something Bob's helping Joe upstairs brother Anderson is right a little bit late so we're saved by hope the hope that is seen is not hope for one of Mencia why does he hope for Abraham didn't have to hope for the baby because the baby was here when at the time when they were turned back but they had to be turned back to young men and women to have the baby but when they got to turn back the young men and women man and woman they had the baby we had enough of hope for the baby the more there was there was an I think there was the product of what had been prophesied that's my brother Adam tells us that we have to meet male kenseth II just like Abraham did every son of the faith will meet and take that journey than Abraham took because Abraham journey was by faith but he met God in human flesh called Milko today and then after that 28 days later he said according to the time of life which the 28 days sample according to the time alone you'll have it in other words you'll have a baby one out here's the mystery that I want to leave my talking about upstairs here's the mystery he never told Abraham and Sarah how he never told him how he said 28 days you're gonna help you'll have a baby and they brands like well okay that's why Sarah laughed in her heart she said me have pleasure with my lord again she knew what he was gonna take to have the baby and then she has having it anymore and he didn't either so supernaturally what I'm trying to say is I'm going we're going through the seals we have the steelbook brother branham spent one night on the force deal we've been now ten services on the force field to try to get an understanding we'll see what happened was he gave brother round them something to give to us but you and I don't have to figure out the end between you and I got to figure out the details cuz he never told Abraham acero now I'm gonna come in one morning you're gonna wake up you see what I'm saying he didn't go through and say you're gonna help he just see you going out baby right the part in between was Abraham's faith and Sarah's faith to believe what God had already said and it wasn't a prophecy anymore it was a reality when he came to pass so what we've been talking about upstairs is those who prophesy must die so everybody that prophesy does not why because you prophesied to somebody else brother Branham prophesied of you and I'm sitting here that's why he had to pass up Jesus had to die because he promised I'd of a ride and now here we come people were coming so you see what I'm saying so anybody that prophesize all that's good you know we're going to go on a rapture no you got to bring it to where the ground said Abraham as good as had the child the day God told him that now you have to wait 25 years to get it we've had to wait 50 something geared for the property being off the same but you and I are gonna have to get booked you aren't wrong I'm saying the seal books about that thick and there's well you've got the breech and then you've got guarding simplicity you got seven eight nine ten sermons when you go to questions and answer then that one book well in that one book the revelation that comes out of that book is gonna change our body and it's going to it has sustained us for 50 something years but it had to nobody said the body change it it's in that book reference AIDS lies in the books in the tape so it's our responsibility it was Abraham's responsibility in other words to carry out what God had told him I'm always telling you before why didn't God went down when he first went Abraham why had he changed him right then you ever thought about left of God can do it he might he just changed Abraham changed Sarah and actually didn't have to change Abraham hello you know James Abraham Abraham to have a child because he had Ishmael so he could produce she's the one who couldn't predict so he had to change the bride yeah change the bride change we're talking about our Heavenly Father God that maybe I'm afraid needing a change at that time but on as we go on the natural story yes he had to have a change because it's what his body was doing as faith then his faith didn't waver but his body was going just like ours do I know he did change Sarah didn't changer at the moment when he told Abraham at the beginning of the journey he didn't tell something he didn't even tell Abraham he was gonna have the baby by Sarah if he had told him the whole story there would not have been an instrumental and there was gonna been a Hagar till they ramble to camp itself and waited for Sarah right what am I saying is God lets us go out through this journey as a free moral agent and not and we've tried to figure it out for years will Abraham trying to figure it out and got in trouble he finally said one day Abraham said can't have this baby no more I can't produce it any more I don't I can't even with a young Hagar you know they ever say what I'm saying so he got to one day before you just went email mail Kevin they can I believe Abraham in his heart said dot if you don't do something I'm gonna die cuz I'm 99 years old and then God comes on the scene just like the children of Israel I was reading a couple of things coming the children of Israel were okay you need you until Pharaoh started pulling things out of there you can't use this and you can't use them you got you got to double your production and all that stuff well then they started crying for a deliverer that's our problem that's why the brother brown said the bride does better on the persecution why are we persecuted well I heavenly things no we got one in our pocket we go home and we eat we go out and eat there's enough cars sitting out here it's a million dollars where the cars almost sitting out here in the parking lot in our parking lot so they've gotta come a time where something's got to come to put our focus back on dependent on God I mean really how many times do we depend on God yeah we depend on God for a lot of things but don't pin on God for our food go to Walmart oh right sighing Damon they take that little thing no I mean we do and I was thinking the other day our sustainability of life guard allows that because that's what he knew we were going to this was going to be this way I mean this is not a surprise to him so he knew that same way with Abraham Sarah he can how long it's gonna take them and have that baby don't you think no Kenzi don't guys anything walked off and said Abraham I talked to you 25 years ago no there was a position what we're going to talk about this afternoon and second service there's a position that everybody has to come to thank God and it goes along with this that God comes to you in that position right because the Son of God was down through the seventh church ages but why does the Son of Man have to appear back in the end time it's promised the son of man had to appear in the intact why for you and I because it's not oh man you're the one that knows nothing about each other the only one that knows I'm type of money James the son of man cuz he's the one who went through so yeah that's great sure and he actually has to let things happen cuz you know what here you got a lot you got to bring lot in well I had to develop to a place to where God finally said pay for him you go that way a lot actually a lot chose remember like hey bring him come down and says hey I got this whole plane all these kind of little things he said do you want split it down the middle and I don't think this side you take that side blocks it well I'll take that side which included Sodom and Gomorrah so he made her own choice hey I made the right choice King I heard a preacher say one time let lot go his way cuz he's fulfilling Scripture - correct block was fulfilling what he's given a lot right sure and brother bowed many times I'll bring it last night brother bad and many times tells us that law was a righteous man the Bible says that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul so he wasn't a sinner but he wasn't the chosen of the bunch Abraham was the chosen of the bunch to take the body change and produce the child a lot was not included in them but now lot was included in Abraham journey okay so same way with the denominations in the foolish virgin he's a top of the foods virgin alright then you had Billy Graham on Oral Roberts identified in the word going down to Sodom and blind in their eyes doing their job preaching what salvation gospel to them but that was what they were that was their box but brother Brown had to come and preach what we've been talking about upstairs the coming of the Son of Man because son of man is to you and I listen so you and I the Son of Man revelation is the most important revelation you'll ever get ever get son of gods fine you saw what's the same it's the same but it's a different dispensation I've been reading that quote three Sundays in a row it's different brother Brian said sunny dog through the church agents on land in the end time it's a different way what is a different way for God to produce its people okay so the Sun man revelation demands demos his well that's what brother brown flash green half of your ministry was wasn't was a revelation to the son of man that God in human flesh not in just him but God in human flesh and the people and he said he'd be the Ministry of the Sun man right not the man right there was only one son of man that was the Lord King described but collectively we make up the body of Christ and the body of Jesus Christ was flesh and would be son of man so when will be the son of man because you know brother Brown said Jesus had three poles in it in his ministry first full faithful purple he explained that when somebody brother Branham will it wasn't different than Jesus's ministry it was the same three colors the same three phases of the message than he had right healing right then bigger fish and then the last one was Jesus was preaching to the totally lost the church which was the people that the mate well let's say the lost and let's say the camellias end up jail d'emilia and Nicodemus that didn't deny Jesus but then walked with him and then you had his he lack which was only twelve one of them was the devil so that's what he had in his in his message same way your brother around him he comes started with a healing campaign millions of people followed him then he started preaching to the Pentecostals the denominational world trying to get them to move over well the ones that did move over he was preaching to the bride to the church and totally lost so that's the same and that's what's happening now well that's why brother man preach three kinds of believers non-believers may believe it from true believers that's the same three full unbeliever make okay so let's finish here likewise the spirit also helpeth on health informatics for we know not what we should pray for as we all know we talked about this last Sunday sometimes we don't know what to pray for you've never been that way how that been that way many times you don't know what to pray for and you pray for thy will be done but you have to be careful there you can't just I've always said it's a those of you and there's nobody here but people of competences pray that God would give me a job and then he go home and sit on the couch so I'm not gonna come knock down the door and say I got to get God he wants a little effort Abraham give a little effort at least Abraham tried to figure out what God was doing he was he was in the motion he was moving all the time same way we got he's not gonna just dump them a job in front of you you got to go because that's your friend Malaysia what more would it be that God to give you a job grab the middle of a turmoil that you weren't looking for something and then all of a sudden there it is you may be looking over here I mean you're looking but then all of a sudden something comes this way well you know that's God before we know not what we should pray for as we off but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered a green scripture yesterday morning where Jesus is telling them going back I'm going back to Matthew Mark Luke and John the scripture that he tells the people that when you come up before judges and Kings to not think about what you were saying well that's what they said he said let the Holy Spirit talk that's the same way with you and I'll let the Holy Spirit talk a lot of times when we talk we get in trouble but is he let the Spirit talk won't be income and he to searches the heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things only that less sunny all things work together for good to them that love God now you have to separate this all things work together for good will have to happen to anybody I'm non-christian but now watch God put this in to them that love God and you can only love God that's that love is not feel your love that's the doctor love you cannot love God with filial love that's back you get in trouble if you do that's a godly love from the inside that's one this thing right here this actually starts down here to see it comes to a head comes to a culmination well we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose now to them that are called you go back to the scripture meaning of calling for your chosen but if you're called according to his purpose you're writing it live the whole scripture lines it right back up where you're in the will of God for whom he did foreknow that's what we were talking about last Sunday that's when we've had the groan that's what we're going for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate so predestination is not just like we were saying predestination is not just that's about predestination according to God now that's predestination according to garden for knowledge he saw your back by foreknowledge he knew exactly the route he was going to take that way but he didn't put you through that - you know I'm gonna make a real bad example but here is the mind of God alright the mind of God this is foreknowledge because he for knew those who he did foreknow all-knowing God be before the foundation the world what was gonna happen but you know what he did he did not make you do this no he saw you do this because you're a friend little agent even brother Brown says you're afraid after you're born again you're free one thing to me to me let me put it this way to me your free moral agency counts more when you're born again than it is when you're not but if you're not born again you're not will is out anyway you're just brutally slain for destruction you're just people walking down the street spilling out space sorry walking dead you know they have a movie The Walking Dead will get what you got plenty oh brother I'm callin cannon fodder now that's pretty rough that's what he said but he also cornea them he didn't pull him through their tube in the center he didn't pull through that cube he saw what they would do and it really helps me because you said well why are these people like and I'll be learning all the bad just real bad people why are the bad people and sometimes you even read in the Bible where it says Lord why in other words one of these people prosper and David said that many times why are my enemies prospering well God's like David don't worry about them leave them there they're there over here but if you're in the mind of God eternal section in the mind of God because there is two sections in the mind of God because Judas he saw all God's thoughts are eternal his thoughts of Judas can't be eternal his thoughts of your sins before you put them under the blood can't be eternal so you got a problem here when you think that well God knows everything God knows everything but one thing he does not know praise God he doesn't know my past sins because they're not in his mind anything they actually never were in the mind at all hello they weren't now he saw what you did yes okay but that part right here in the eternal section because really this is the book we've been looking at this is the book of life and then there's an eternal section because the book of life never biting than that yes a book of life because when you go to revelations revelation says the book we wrote was open we're not in that book oh we're not in the book we are the book now see yeah I'll go with eternal security with the Baptist if they'll believe it like that by foreknowledge we always was eternal I'm going the people in the message about foreknowledge we always look eternal but not that we started with eternal life right no we were here in eternal life for though he don't form from whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate pre destined predetermined destiny now if you take that then this is predetermined destiny without foreknowledge you can't have that there's no free will in there there's no free moral agency my brother Branson God didn't put you that's one man cube God didn't clue you through you they saw the cubed over by your choice you have plenty of choices plenty of choices sorry you know really he knew that it can you that we don't see that we're never going to take a body thing because you know what that's what you're seeing that's what you're seeing now let's go back to foreknowledge eternal section or not the eternal section you come from the mind of God God met you in a new birth you walked your path and then you're gonna take a body change or die go by the grave and you still think I'm right this is our problem now that may be our leader need to get the gun right but this is all these needs listen even a property God told us he said God don't even see a Christian since they're coming he only hears your voice this whole world is covered by the blood of Jesus Christ he hears our voice but now that eternal section that's that Genesis 1:26 man that's that man never sinned if you're born again today you never gender dating on that person did a man that's what were you saying I'm going while I knew that you're making a laundry list God didn't see that if you put it under the blood it can never be remembered again that's according to the Bible so those he foreknew he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of many brethren Paul's not finished with his thought moreover of whom he did predestinate by foreknowledge then he also called and whom he called he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified there's only one way God could do that and says no your journey from beginning to the end right why shall we then say to these things free to read them that takes all the curves out and then it takes all the curves out because if he predestinated you by foreknowledge knew you would accept the word knew you would become the word made flesh then those whose justified Authority glorified in God's eyes were already glorified we're already sitting in heavenly places the Bible sarcomas then that's our biggest problem then we go well I do this I do this I do this I do it that's what's keeping us here he despairs on his own son but delivered him up for us all this is how we got it how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall they look who shall lay anything now they don't say anything you notice that's two words any thing so you can make that thing sin who shall lay any sin to the charge of God's elect you can't it's God to justify who is he that condemneth exactly the question it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us Freda that's your your on curve when you get outside of that cube he makes intercession well if you're a child to god guess what you come right back you know you just keep go wrong right who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution their family all want to know about this he been through him a bit famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter NAND all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded let's see what that worked me good my nifty little concordance here convinced by analogy but with one down here less thing to realize by n-word certainty outside mass not one good but inside man can to persuade to induce one by words to believe bosses for I'm persuaded in other words all this that God has given me that I'm writing to you I am so persuaded I am convinced I am convinced I am convinced that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth he's not covered at all nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord that's our lover right there Christ you miss our Lord no one can separate I love what Paul said the Paul is really verse 1 through 37 he's give us the journey but in verse 38 and 39 he's just sewing it all up Brian persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord nothing can separate so therefore if God be for us who can be against us and that's what we all right let's read this just for a minute and we'll to me Romans 8 is just a chapter that covers all of your cushion along rings in your adoption brings in plate while the placing and adoption that brings in your Christianity it brings in your walk and even tell you what God thought about you and thinks about you right and we got to believe that and we are believe in time we're living in that's one that that brother Branson will know who we are and what we're doing here one know our position our position is not to throw this to somebody else our position is to take this make it manifest and take a body change and you know I just got an automatic to take a body cam like I said before my god just coming to Abraham there in her of Jodie's and rock 22 Abraham get up walk and take a journey why do you just change him then we didn't need to any change at that time I've done benefit that the bride was one it needed to change not him I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost then I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to them pertain of the adoption of an eloquent comment on this will this is Scripture Romans 9 for is relaxed to whom pertaineth the adoption that the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God the promises it went to them first Jesus even and he said yeah yeah I have a problem with this scripture Jeep Duvall says he came to his own and his own received him not they were never his own now because we were his own we were the kingdom of God they realize whenever the kingdom of God he divorced them in the Old Testament but I'm not saying scriptures bad I know what it means but in when you first see that you go what do you mean we men go and you remember Jesus told them he said don't go he said only go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel Jesus was telling them no you know the Gentile Wow because that dispensation had not come yet he knew that Paul and Peter would be taking it to the Gentile because I'm telling you every time he met a Gentile they got what they wanted thank this air Phoenician woman the Centurion one or two other instances I've read it the other day where Jesus said I have found no greater faith in them well he wasn't probably to Israel he was talking to the woman that he called her dog and the Centurion that said I don't want you to come to my house on my word just say the word and he said I found no greater faith but what was that he was the Roman he was a Gentile so and I know what it was when Jesus came to his people or was born among those people he considered them his people earthly where his children Israel's not his children where his children if the intros his children they go to the future home with us Israel is not his children he said what about 144,000 they get the Holy Ghost here that remember remember nobody no one from Jesus back which was the Old Testament which was the Jews with truth Israel received the Holy Ghost in their soul until Jesus died resurrected came back on a dampened cough then there was 120 and then remember the 3,000 downstairs was all over the nation they weren't all Israelite because the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost that wasn't just Israel if you'll study your history even now the day of Pentecost all a lot of the people from many nations gather in Israel for the day of Pentecost it's like a festival to them now I'm sorry that's correct because they came from different places they heard him in their own language remember they said that how these we hear in their own language so there was a lot of different languages out there a lot of different nations but don't get me wrong about one kid but you don't think what Jesus said he said don't go don't go to Gentile go to my people go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel why he was well he was trying you know what he was doing he was trying his best to get them to see it even though he knew they weren't you know why gotta be witness I came to you and you turned me down okay so that's why it's written that way but Jesus Christ came to earth to get a bride that was inside of him that couldn't get out that was that was longing to get out and we're talking about that maybe a little bit this afternoon that's why the son of man had come son of man was flesh God they had us in him the Son of God we were in the mind of God that Genesis 1:26 men talk about the Stephanie good everybody runs around the country and especially in the message saying son of man son of man son of man son of man whoa weren't they saying you better know what they're saying the last son of man what's going to change your body people have had the son of God and sense did they back off Caladan have son matt revelation he left sent back the whole ego sent back the Holy Ghost to go in their soul to teach them how to be Christian but my son man have to come back in the end time you seen your Bible I read it this morning and when I tell you this afternoon you able to shock you it's been there the whole time why the son of man had to come back and it's in a scripture that we read all the time and it pertains to this age it's in the book of Revelation and then I found one clover brother better tell exactly explains what I thought it was but he explains it so I'm gonna let the Prophet really think that's the last thing we'll read this afternoon so most heavy trucks they away who are is a lot to new pretend the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law the service and God promises because listen put folks God never wanted to live in a tyrant ankle with badger skin and he he never wanted to sacrifice an animal none of that he wanted to do but it was allowed because of the sin that Adam and Eve caused in the garden so that he could be a savior he could be Jehovah he could be the father all these different attributes this is the way I had to go there's no other way I could win this is the only way to the win there is realized in things adoption to go in the company and the giving of the law service of God promises because remember what Jesus told him he stood there one day and he said you see y'all keep all these days and times and you keep all these washing into the pots and you you you've garnished you go out there and you you wipe the tomb of the prophets in other words you go out Washington take it's pretty Washington watch them you know and he said you put them in there that's how hypocritical they were and that's why they hated him because he said you put the people that's in that tomb you put them in there anyways it y'all put y'all killed the prophets whose are the fathers of them as concerning the flesh Christ came to see look flat in the flesh who is over all and God bless forever amen not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel right why what neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children Abraham had many other children beside one but he had one chosen son Ishmael they guard told Ishmael said you'll be like the sands of the sea just like your father you'll be a wild child well that's all them people is over there now there's a lot of people come from Ishmael then they came right straight from a pronounced natural loins but not considered them from Isaac and Isaac but in Isaac shall thy seed be called and that's not natural that's going to spiritually was natural and Isaac hey he has some problem children down in his lineage okay so you know naturally but remember what are we going back to that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed not natural seed because remember it says not unto Abraham with seeds that are many but one seed which is Christ these are all allegories these are all examples in the Old Testament Abraham did not birth Christ but he birthed the promised child in the Old Testament which was a topic right okay that is they went through the children CL I'm telling you all these are taught but everything is talking you and me that is they were through the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time will I come in Sarah shall have a son remember what I said before when Abraham started his journey he was married to Sarah but God said you're gonna have a promised child he never said by who but when Melchizedek met him and changed his name no cassia Nick told him said by Sarah you'll have that child will Abraham me write them well then we got a problem a real problem now because I could be with Hagar and have children I compete with this other woman and now children but I've been with her since we kids and we don't you you gonna tell me what I'm saying even when things were right and going through today right I like that too and I want to bring this in because what did Sarah say she said me have a pleasure look my word again she remembered all the the she remember that in her humanity she's like god you're telling me we're gonna well he didn't give her the whole leaders say what I'm gonna change you and you don't know and that's the same way I think it will be with a change I don't think it's gonna be God's gonna say this day is when the change is gonna come you know the excellent know caliber I think right now it's already happening it's a gradual change it's a gradual change for us it was one time for them but I think it's a gradual change no we're not gonna start looking younger but we gotta let this thing come into that outside mother of a middle man remember reason consolation imagination the spirit realm it's what we need to work on now and that's what this is working on a man because if you're born again in your soul you don't have a temper in your soul but you do have temperance in that spirit realm then you live in that when your mom and daddy hurt you you got a nature and it's all contrary to God's so that temperance is contrary to go ahead until God changes it takes that out and then the same thing with each one of these I hope you see that that's one of those types of perfect man to me it's one of the most important things that we need to understand because without it you can't change your body without it you die then I mean just physically died not spiritually though physically there let me read this verse 9 then will for this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even the fire father Isaac for the children being yet born have done no good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand it is said to her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob my love and Esau have I hated now God didn't choose that he knew what he saw was gonna do before he saw was born go back to what he saw Mike before knowledge by foreknowledge he knew and it always bothered me about things like that but you know what God knows that if he gave Esau a million years to live he'd never repent and come back same way with a dog the other same way with everybody in the world he knew that he'd given time and they do not repent [Music] [Music]
