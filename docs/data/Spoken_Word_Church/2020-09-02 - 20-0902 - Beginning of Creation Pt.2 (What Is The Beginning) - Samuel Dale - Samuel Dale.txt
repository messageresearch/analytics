time last weekend uh wade and i dedicated brother forney's church and everything got a nice little building there that they can increase it some if they need and and everything but it's it's really really comfortable and should be uh you know be able for to for them to have church in it see maybe 50 60 right now they can change a little bit and do something but we had a good time it's on the internet the church church website youtube so if you want to watch it you can click on there and and watch it and see how we do it in dedicating a a church and also just uh we thank you for for everything we thank the ministers for taking over and all while we've been missing on some of these and uh different things we we've done it it's been kind of an odd thing to me because we went from everything from uh let's see which come first we went to a wedding in a funeral and then dedicating a church so we've been traveling and and doing and and all of these things and and had a good time doing it and pray that we done the best we could do but it turned out real good in each one of the cases but remember that just keep remembering my wife she still has trouble breathing she'll be okay for a little while and then it'll hit her and striker and she has trouble breathing through her nose she can still breathe pretty good through her mouth but it's through her nose and all feels like cotton she said stuck up there but at least we're open enough to where that they can now get into being able to go see doctors that can help the this situation you know and all like that because that's just a hangover part but just keep praying for it the lord would would bless her and everything and all of that amen uh now we're going to try if you want to we're going to try this coming weekend to have a number two stage or phase of what we generally do and if you remember that was that everybody's welcome to come but you have to sit according to the pews and the way they are and sit not real close now you can do it if you like a family can sit together if you want to that way you know and all but not uh you know the the rest of it and just use it in downstairs we're gonna have the open downstairs and open up here for you to be able to see and do all right now we're going to put one thing into stage uh this is from us but uh mainly to say from myself uh i'm asking us if we would all please wire mask all right now i'm meaning while we're here i'm meaning while you're in the church i'm meaning while the service is going on that's what i mean where's where i'm inside or outside you know we're trying to to do a little bit to where when we leave here now and going outside we put the mask on but let's put it the whole thing just how to wear a mask the whole time that we're here all right and that way it won't give any uh problems we should cover all of the the things and you know then when you go outside make sure you just wear the mask all the time you're here on the property inside the building outside the building and all to do and it'd be mandatory for everybody to uh do now this be hard for this for the preacher because it'd be muffled out and things so that won't be required for the preacher to do you know we'll kind of set that aside and the song leader to where that you can be clear enough to understand okay we're not trying to be too much but we'll do it that way but as quickly as you minister or song leading you go sit down put the mask on all right you understand we're just going to try to go that away and see how it works out and all if it does we'll keep increasing possibly we'll we will announce it sunday but we may try to take communion the next sunday if we do we'll try to arrange something either we can make it inside or we can make it work that we can just line up outside and and walk out to church and take communion as you're going out and whatever we can do we'll try to because you know everybody wants to go to church and get back in church because that's that's that's part of it i i like to be in church and but we're going to try to do the best we can to follow and and and do it on the grounds don't hug and and do everything you know try to keep everything uh what is that word distances yeah i never didn't understand why they call it social because you know social district social means you would get together distance okay no problem but just remember that but we do truly thank brother luis they're started last wednesday then brother bob and brother aaron for sunday services and i think they've done a marvelous job it was you know good good services all three of them i really enjoyed it and all three of them related to each other and we're still right on the same thing because you're going to pick that up tonight and just keep going with it and praying that god would bless all of us anything else i'm thinking that's basically what's covering the whole thing okay all right we're going to try what we can okay revelations 3 14 and john 1 14-18 father we thank you for your grace and your love thank you for everything and we just ask you lord to be with us and help us we're trying our best to do everything we can in the physical realms and things of life to try to not aggravate these things and and try to bring on these situations we're doing the best we can lord and doing that that and trying to be able to come to church and have a good time we ask you that you just reach down and touch all of these that are sick and lord remember our wife remember richard remember uh the different ones many of us named tonight and just have your way some lord they've been sick for quite a while and we pray that you would just reach down and touch each one in your loving your grace maybe we can get back together and have more fellowship into the to the the church and things and that will be able to bring you on the scene in our hearts and lives because you did promise it you said wherever two or three are gathered in my name you'd be in the mist so as we gather a few more people coming in and fellowshipping together around thy word we pray that you would just come on the scene and touch each one forgive our sins lead us by thy grace and love and keep us in jesus name amen all right we've been on this we'll probably be using this for a while but i knew that would do that i'm losing my eyes yeah i don't need them anyway i can run out of ones yeah that's the way glasses do okay revelation 3 14. okay what are we on what is the beginning we're in the beginning of creation part two now we're going to talk about tonight more on what is the beginning all right and unto the angel of the church of the lady of sian's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now let's go to john 1 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and his fullness have all we received in grace for grace for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ no man hath seen god now notice that and keep it in mind no man has seen god at any time all right the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i want us to stick with it tonight a little more because of what we spoke on the last time in uh trying to to do you remember what we were talking about we're gonna have three parts or three stages whatever you want to call it part one is seeing almighty god and how he manifests himself how he comes into being to where we can comprehend all right and then we'll move into the second stage which will be into the word dwelling with us and the sun coming down to where that we can comprehend that and then we will get to the bride of jesus christ and all because we're dealing with what all god was yes now how many times did the prophet say that all god was was poured into christ all christ was was poured into the to the church and to take her back to the garden of eden the threefold purpose of christ is a mystery all right now how have we tried to cover that remember all god was was poured into christ well does that mean there's no more god you know all right see then you know what states and all god was poured into christ well okay no more god then you take all christ poured into the church is it no more christ see that's what i'm saying the words words we use are are uh the hardest thing to try to comprehend with i don't know where you'd say that right or not but you know it's hard to communicate because our minds are the way they are all right we think well oh we're doing good i don't see why in the world anybody couldn't understand that well why does a theologian teach a trinity now i'm talking about you know a theologian a a highly educated trained person who knows all of the greek the hebrew the the thing but why does he come up with a trinity out of the word of god when it is not even in the word at all all right and see then you you look at it like that and you you you begin to think about that our problems is our mind our comprehension of uh wordings you know and things it it messes us up you say well now uh uh we we should all say well that's true now like i've always said and this crazy way of saying it um but you you can go overseas and and you can see different languages and different people and all i can but you know what little bit that i've been overseas i never detected the dogs barking in spanish and and you know you understand i've never heard a dog bark in spanish i don't i don't understand why see maybe the dog has some more ability to communicate than we do because he doesn't do that but yet the people speak to him in spanish right and they will train him and he'll comprehend in spanish because that's just a part of doing it but to start with he doesn't bark the mark don't change because it's the same all right now what was our main point like i said then we're studying what all god was we're going to see how that's poured into christ all right then how christ is poured into the church and we'll see then that that is the way to understand how we're going back to the garden of eden are to be fully redeemed all right now so what was the main point that we were trying to make on our lives uh which was uh the first message of this we're talking about beginning of creation because we read there you'll get to that later see i'm using it in to word it'll match up see when you come to the beginning of the creation of god you've moved over a stage or two that you know that you need to have understanding how you got there all right so we're we're taking what the prophet said and the wordings he says and then applying that to where we're at and and what we're doing to understand all right now we know that there in the old testament when he came forth he was the i am he said i am that i am that was to be his name forever all right now i am means ever-present for eternity but you just don't pray and say i pray thee in the ni in in i am i pray thee and i am no we we we're smart enough to understand we're told to pray in the name of jesus christ he said ask anything in my name we'll pray we're to pray in that name why because that name is the i am amen you're recognizing him as that i am the ever president for eternity is speaking to you that's his name his name was not even jehovah that's that's that's certain of scripture he said by my name jehovah was i never known that's right all right it's jvhv and there was no way to pronounce it and the best they could do was call it jehovah all right but he said by my name jehovah by jvhv i was never known see there was no way to no way to understand that so the best you could do is go back to self-existing you can go back and pick up the wordings then of of elohim and showing that elohim means self-existing all you all of those things running back to the point of understanding what his name is but his name is jesus see that's that should be the most simple thing for us to understand as you you'd say to somebody say what's the name of god well his name's god no no god's not a name god's a title jehovah jireh jovitis jehovah tischendo et cetera et cetera that's titles to a name but his name is jesus well then everything we pray and everything we do the bible says is to be done in the name of jesus christ all right that's why our baptism is correct all of the things we have see following it we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ all right that's simple to us but do you realize that the biggest portion of the religious world does not believe that they believe in father son and holy ghost they won't take it and try to understand all right because it's contrary in their wording and you know their teachings coming down all right but we were we're trying to to get up to a point there i was in the last message to understanding what the statement the prophet made and by him making that statement it sounds like contrary to common sense but yet it is the only way once you get it lined up correctly in your mind it's just like lord jesus christ father son and holy ghost is any trouble with that i can tell you because that's the way we baptize to fulfill the great commission amen now i found that from the prophets reason i used it that way because we already know it enough to use it but when i baptize somebody i'll say to fulfill the great commission of baptizing the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost i'd now baptize thee my brother sister in the name of the lord jesus christ all right that's simple terminologies to us and simple truth but to the world it is baffling because they can't understand that no father's father his name is father's father you know father well father is not a name son is not a name holy ghost is not a name that way we can can lean back into the word and find a real truth but it'll come all the way my emphasis is it comes all the way through just as we were talking about uh let's see in the uh the dedication of the the church see here's moses taking in bad badger skins et cetera and made us ten god was happy to come down dwell in it but that wasn't what he wanted it was okay it was fine then here comes david over really wanting to build god a house and supply the material because when he found out he couldn't do it he turned it over to solomon well since when solomon built a house for god god was so happy about that until he came down into those situations there and and so was engulfed in the building till they couldn't even worship and couldn't couldn't do anything why because he was so happy so pleased to dwell but that still wasn't it trying to get a little point like slide something in there see all right then one day a baby was born and that baby growed up and he was there on the river jordan and john baptized him and he says this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell there was the body hebrews 10 5 of almighty god was that human body and we'll get to it on the next stage too more of it on the beginning of the creation of guardians and coming through that but there it was there was the fulfillment of the scriptures that god could come down and be pleased to dwell in a human vessel but he was pleased to dwell in a building all right but it's like i was emphasizing to them now don't forget now and think about it that when we go out the door god goes out the door and it's an empty building do we get back and he don't come in the building till we get back don't get all tied up in situations or something just be sensible you know if he wants to stay here he can stay here if he wants to go we can go with i'd rather think about him going with me or in me because the body thou has prepared me all right that body when it came forth that was the body of almighty god that body was a bottle you know of 16 elements and that was as i said we'll get over to the next day or two when it says the beginning of the creation of god and brought around and said when did it when did this begin he said in the wound of a virgin all right we'll get to those stages as we go along but i want you to just kind of drop back and stay with me into thinking about what does the word beginning mean to you well something starts well that's that's all right that's that's human terminologies you know but what is really you know something beginning the beginning of the creation of god it don't even you mean god had a beginning see beginning of the creation are you saying well well god was non-existence and then he become existent no i've tried to explain that and people look at me you know and over the years i've tried my best to explain it that you know you say well brother dale do you mean before this world ever begun that that god had a body yeah yeah that's exactly what i believe you say well what kind of a body was this 16 l it's better than this body let me quote the prophet about a theophany when we get over that he said it's far more greater than your natural body for more greater than your hands for more greater than your eyes see it's more real all right as we go back that way to comprehend eternal god remember it's not going to become less it's not something that is being done away with it neither going forward are we going to leave something no it's in our thinking to where we can say god is real he's not like the wind i've got a quote here from the prophet he said he's a being. [Music] he said he's not like the wind all right see now when you say god is a spirit what do you think of our terminologies no let's say we're back of like a 20 30 years ago we used to think that way anyway well we should be getting away from that much but still our terminologies about things is what's confusing god is a spirit john what 4 24 they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth well what was the first man that god made a spirit man why because god was a spirit okay we're great we'll follow that i never believed that that he didn't exist because see the more you would go backward into understanding you would find greater things you mean to tell me you think that they could they could be back there somewhere that he was tangible well why not right right the word of god is tangible faith is the substance of things so far that's pretty well tangible the substance of what anything you hope for that's what faith really is and see the father we would go back into eternity you're never going to go back so far that you run out of god that's right right because you go back to self-existing but then remember that when he was self-existing he was far more real than we are as existing right that's the way i believe it that's the way i've always taught it why because i believe in one god don't do away with anything to try to explain one god let it explain itself let it let it unfold and and and be able to understand you know and that way the things that is said by the prophet and the bible won't be confusing look at scripture god is a spirit well he's just a spirit he's just something floating around well if he's floating around he's something come on oh no no he's just well a spirit is something the only problem is is we're trying to bring into our situation of looking at tangibles to try to bring him into that situation well come on he hasn't been far beyond that because he's done brought it into being that was the point i was trying to get us that to where let's go ahead and pick up the ones because i want to make sure we keep getting this go to number three which is questions and answers on genesis this is the one that you you read it through you know that's that's number two quote number three okay now if god created man in his own image and his own likeness what kind of a man did he create a spirit man not a spirit a spirit man amen see when i look at it god is a spirit i look at it as in this way god is a spiritual being now i've got something tangible that my eyes cannot see that my hands cannot feel but i've got something there that is called faith that is then the substance of what things is and that comes from faith what is faith well i right turned my hand you know i i i got faith no that won't control the world that won't heal your body when you're sick right but if you've got faith it is the substance of what you're asking for it's the evidence of things that is you know real all right so now listen to what he's saying what kind of a man did he make all right what is god the bible says god is the spirit okay then if god is a spirit then he created a spirit man amen right now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asks the question we'll find this that god give dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man but in his makeup up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle now that is a spirit man that is not a physical man spirit man who remember the back emphasis on the message before what did we cover we're covering two things ways covering two parts bob dylan's been in and everybody brother louise come in with the uh you know for knowledge and well praise god aaron coming along hitting on it okay we're all trying to do one thing get to see something real you know right i'm talking about something real ain't talking about just a spirit floating around but i i will say it this way i've never been drunk never trained any but i've always heard these people talk about that you you get drunk and you get seeing pink elephants well that guy would run in front of a train probably get away from a pink elephant but the pink elephant don't exist that's the thoughts of his mind all right but look at this coming on down now the beast of the fields just like the holy spirit leads to believers today he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creations of god amen now remember is who adam amen and the lord bringing it downward not lower down bringing it down to be able to comprehend see the first creation was god himself first creation is god himself i can just see a theologian here and brother branham and say those things you know and he says well that guy's all messed up he don't but he's saying it the only way it can be said you tell me any other way that can be said how can you explain god which is so far back that away until it's eternity granting and just keeps going and he's so far that away until his eternity is still going and how can you explain god well he's just a spirit no he's not a spirit the prophet said if you want it he said he's a being said he's not like the wind not just something floating around you know he's a being all right he's a spiritual being all right so put that in your little computer brain parts and think about when you say god is a spirit they say god is a spiritual being he's a being he's a person right all right then out of god came the logos which was the son of god then out of the logos which was the word comes on the beginning was the word you're coming on down to the man but stay up in here until we we'll get a stage two when we start talking about the logos the theophany the word the creation etc and you'll see that then god is so real until you won't miss what is being said so just think about it now the first creation was god himself let's put it this way uh the first thing that could be comprehended understood was god himself now you can just keep going you said but but brother dale uh god is a spirit was there a time that he wasn't no there wasn't the time that he was in the spirit now come on listen there's not a time that he wasn't god we're just trying to explain it oh no no no no he he wasn't god because god is an object of worship well god was an object of worship before a man who got here to worship him so don't run that route seeing and it's it's our thinking we bring our thinking into it and say god is a spirit well brother dale just don't understand god is a spirit well explain to me what a spirit is a spirit can go through that wall and come back right let's see you do it so there's something more powerful there than we're talking you know in our human terminologies something is more real than what our thoughts all right now if it's true that moses saw i am at the burning bush and that i am stayed so much in a con connection to mankind until when jesus came forth he said before abraham was i am he said i am that i am ever present for eternity and that's his name not to just say his name as i am he had a name before i am came into being now let me put it this way because i want to correct my own thoughts and but telling you something about brother brown says there was a time he didn't have a name i mean you know that's no problem to me there was a time he had no connection to mankind that would relate to a name he had no reason for a name he had no no doing there was nobody there he existed alone see that's why i thought that when brother louise was preaching earlier today that's why people will say well you know i was back there be careful how far you go back because you could predestinate yourself out of existence right i mean you would you would actually be taking yourself totally out of existence you got to remember the eternal life always was eternal the prophet said not your being here not what we are see but to follow it and see that the bible explains one truth of the living god and the bible starts out and the prophet started out explaining god all right now you got a problem when you start doing that because the human terminologies as i've been saying over and over that runs into into our makeup and our mind and starts bouncing around with those little marbles in there and it don't work too good all right but you see the first creation was god himself now was he nothing and then he created himself well only ask one thing where did he get where he what he created himself from if you're going to say he created his own self no get all of that see get that out of our mind and our thinking get it in there in the basis of understanding one thing the word beginning sure means something that starts a starting point you've got many terminologies or points brought to it but think of the fact that he always has been and always will be the eternal god there's no time for him to start that he mean he wasn't back there and there's no time for him to run out of over here just think about it think about then being as a time that because let's let's just go to that scripture and join them all right now what does it say it says the only begotten hath declared him the only begotten have declared him what does declare mean to bring out into the open or to show or to make known you know something coming into being something that you could not comprehend before but all at once it can be comprehended and once it does it's more real than what this was over here that you're right see god is real and that's the whole point i i keep bringing these where you'll think about it you say well will he become he become god when he created the angels what was he before then that just means the angels worshiped him was he before then you know how did he exist before then was he non-existent now you're going to predestinate him clean out of existence i'm trying to preach one god i said this many many years ago i said i didn't finish what i see i said one of these days i'll get around and preach on one god well i'm around for trying it okay just bear with me to worry that i can try to express it if you don't agree with it just come tell me you think it's a better way to explain it come tell me i'd sure love to know because see god never just was non-existent you know i can't do this the way i want to but i'm making this like a point that see you can't see this piece of paper all right so it's nonexistent there's nothing up here then all at once here comes some see that's what you're thinking that's what your mind is is telling you that there was a time he didn't exist but then he existed now think about it see i love the way the prophet says it like this and see then remember the other week i kept emphasizing you know that adam and eve did not make god a father he was already a father for them they didn't make him a father he was a father before then he was god before then he was all of these things back there back in time as we'd call it but yet back in eternity and see you'd say well well well that made him father that didn't make him father for adam and eve he was already the father he already existed as a father he was just not known as that he was already god he's always you ever heard the prophet say he's always been god well then why do we want to put something well he well i i got the quote where the prophet said well amen but what are you trying to do with it i mean is it to you that there's somewhere that your god did not exist at all and then he come into existence why not put it to the basis that that he was always existed but he couldn't come into existence to the human mind because that's what really being brought out means it means to bring him forth or declare means to lead out to go before no to unfold see it means to come forth what did he do he declared him there was no way listen there was no way to understand god outside of the bases of the lord jesus christ becoming that one that would first start dealing with as we'll get to it later as the christ then dealing with him as the human element then dealing with him back into the church which looks like you're going backwards no you keep him going forward see when this winds up and you see the way that i'm trying to bring it you're going to see all god was according to christ and all christ in the church you're going to see every move he makes is that much more it ain't going to leave a gap all god was he poured in the crowd seal it off well where's god he ain't no more he poured him over here no that makes him greater i mean i'm sorry that's why i said that may seem greater where he could take what he was and bring it into another form and morphe changed and manifest himself finally one day until on the shores of galilee walked a man that could say before abraham was i am amen season that body will never be done away will but now we've got the prophet's message thank god for see that body was not eternal it was born from a woman it was created in the wound of a virgin that body had to be made eternal in the resurrection in rapture back there of the lord jesus the chains the ascension all right see then it became eternal but it'll never be separated no more that's why i've always taught it i always believed it when we get there we're not going to see a father a son a holy ghost and this and brother ernie gets that flooding that dove floating around i like him's way because he says them catholics get that dove floating like that but it's not going to be when we get there we'll see jesus and realize that all the time he was god he said show us the father then it suffices us or satisfied he said have i been so long with you if you've seen me he said you've seen the father but just keep in mind now what i'm talking about all god was poured into christ doesn't do away with god it increases glory right because i like the way brother harris was preaching you know he said that old devil he said if he left jesus alone said he had one jesus one christ he said if he just left him alone instead of that he jumped on him he killed him said first thing you know you got 120. then the next hour a few later you've got 3 thousand if he'd left him alone well see he couldn't do it but follow me now why would a prophet say the first thing was god himself amen now to be able to fulfill all the scripture of the declaring now listen because that's what we read in john but the son hath declared him now before you can bring that into being you've got to bring four thousand years of existence on earth where was god then because that existence of coming into the christ could be seen back there but not fully made manifest but then one day here come a man on earth his name was jesus and upon him on the river jordan right i believe that those brothers were trying to preach if they didn't just listen i believe that i believe that on the river jordan he became the fullness of the godhead bodily well before that when the holy ghost was he was a baby he was a teenager right it couldn't be the fullness at that time he couldn't die for our sins at two years old that's right oh see get your mind in the thinking gear all right but see one day you see what was taking place the father stepped down in human flesh now listen for a second that human flesh is called the son of god okay son of god now he never declared himself to be the son of god so hold on why why did he not declare himself to be the son of god come on and you thought about it why did he not relate to himself as son of god he always related to himself as son of man now back to where adam and eve was didn't make him father do you realize brother brandon made a statement one day and he said in the son of man he became the father he wanted to be man that looks like human reproductions right but no because you see that's the point you go back in god to word that he's there and he's the first in stage 2 he's the son now you're to john 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among now you've got it to her there was standing a man the word was standing in human flesh where was it before then through the prophets to the men of all through the time i know that it hurts people's feelings for you to say things and it it hurts some people's feelings here one time for me to make the statement everybody was talking about son of man i said why talk about son of man where's the son of god and i said would you raise your hand if you tell me where the son of god started or what is it beginning everybody raised me started 2 000 years ago i said no way i said even scofield even those theologians come back there and what did brother branham say in that statement while ago out of the logos came the son of god the word the son of god was back there because remember now listen you remember this with the last message father never created the son is the creator because he's the word not meaning he couldn't create he just moved over in another form and began to create now listen he moved over in another form and began to create and we call him the son now he who god almighty moved over in another form and we call him the son well who was he before then he was god almighty he moved over into another form and begin to say let there be now you can go back to genesis and when it says and god created the heavens and the earth and don't say back there jesus created the heaven and the earth no because the flesh man jesus was back there the one god is being revealed through the prophet and we're talking about it who or in other words what is the beginning are you listen to the point it took 4 000 years to come from a time wise come from a time of genesis 1 1. god created heaven it took 4 000 years and god finally created a body to live in now may i quote the prophet because back there he he finished the physical physical creation he said well jesus was yeah but that's a higher order see go back there with me in the thinking that here is almighty god he's dwelt alone there's nothing nobody with him or anything he's self-existing and he just steps over into another form so he created himself he stepped over in another form he became the word but then it took 4 000 years for that to materialize to be a flesh man right that's right it took 4 000 years for that son of god the word to keep creating until it would bring the prophets to bring the body right am i with the prophet the prophets brought the body john was the last one to introduce the head jesus christ was the head all right and there when he stepped out on the river jordan john said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world behold our almighty god in human flesh isn't this easy to think about when the prophet would say it his first creation was god himself not a creation like that none existed and he created it and because remember remember if you're thinking that way then you've got somebody over here creating something over there so be careful now because that's what we got to do and that's what i kept emphasizing in the last message brother branham said did god send a son i got a bunch of quotes on that if you want to did god send a son he said no he came himself see when he stepped over into another form he came himself he didn't do away with that to make that non-existent that just moved over with him the father just became the son which is god in another form right and seeth in that god created and we'll get to those times and he began to be into that beginning of the creation of god but yet that was not the total fulfillment because he would have to wait until the bride comes forth to be able to say to this age the beginning of the creation of god and meaning it's a bride amen you're coming right down to where you are and that's the way we're going to have to see it we're going to see ourselves and it's not god moving from one form to another and leave a vacuum and he gets over here and he gets through with this when he moves over and then leaves the vacuum leaves the vacuum leaves the vacuum no he just reveals himself in another form the finality of his natural doing took place in jesus christ because there was the sun as we read in the scripture in john the son hath the clarity brought him out in the open showed him right because what did jesus say now you ever thought about this what does god look like now i know i'm stupid and crazy man i'll get a thought every once in a while what's god look like i thank god that we've got what the prophet said hoffman was the closest but now he didn't say it with all of it but he said it was the closest anything he'd ever seen because he seen him out in the field right if jesus was god being god in another form his name is jesus he looks like jesus now wait a minute now well what did jesus look like jesus said i come in my father's name if you've seen me he said you've seen the father amen trying to preach one god trying to get one god down in a a realm that for 30 years i've been trying to so forgive me just despair with me if i repeat myself just all right just unplug that one and you know you can take my hearing aid you know you can just take one of them out and i'm not silly i'm just truthful i know and realize this is one thing that this man knows and has known for a long time you cannot change people you cannot change their mind they're going to keep that natural mind in their thinking you've got to go to the inside man i am not dealing with your body i am not dealing with your second realm spirit i'm dealing with your soul talking to you because what did brother branham say he said god came himself he said now in body he was a man he said but in spirit he was god in another statement he said in body he was a man he said in soul he was god so who was that man that was walking the shores of galilee god in another form called a son now what is he to be in the last days god in another form called the bride because all god was he poured into christ all christ he pours into the church then he takes that church back to the garden of eden or returns her back to where she's supposed to be or restores her may i say it this way restores her to her original position you may not think like i do and i'm i'm glad i guess maybe everybody don't but i look at the things brother branham are saying and i said well see you look there he he he made a man in the garden that made him god he was already god he was already god he always was god he never was anything else he just was not made manifest see jesus come to declare or to bring him out in the open he said i do nothing until my father shows me brother brandon what did he say he said he didn't do nothing without a vision no i wouldn't be glad to give you these because he's he said he didn't do nothing without a vision he said that's why i wait on him he waited for a vision waited for an interpretation or a thought but listen to lead out or go before see beginning can be go before all right what's he going before he's moving from one existence to another existence and he doesn't lose anything everything in this existence goes with him and then when he pours it into the church all that's in existence of him all the way down is finalized and pouring into the church that's why i like that the scripture there where it says you know uh this is my son in whom i'm pleased to dwell well i think he says that every time he gives out the new birth if he gives you the baptism of the holy ghost he is pleased to dwell now you tell me i'm wrong there i'll just ask you what reasonable sense you got because if he's in there he's pleased to be there right because he ain't going to force him in there no it's going to be a pleasing factor so then what was it the first creation was god himself now go to number five brothers let's get number five i'm jumping over a couple but you got it number five now when he said here that he emptied himself or poured himself now we would think like this that he vomited up now see that's our terminologies that's our words that mean that word that's used for there to empty himself up is to vomit out that's human terminologies to explain it that he vomited up the english word of emptied are poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him now there's your beginning that looks like see something went out it was different because listen but the word kinos in the greek does not mean that he vomited up or or his arm went off or his eye went out or another person that is he changed himself he poured himself into another itself into amen into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the holy spirit amen but it was he himself said you get it god all the fullness of godhead bodily was in that person jesus christ he was god and god alone not a third person or a second person or a first person now that explained that one but the person god veiled in human flesh he wasn't the third person second person or the first person he wasn't the first one he was the person of almighty god that's why he's not like the wind blowing he's a being [Music] but see he stepped out in other words moved out into another form okay now listen get natural with it for a minute all right there was a time when donnie was born as a baby you know all right well see you know what he he's changed forms since then right but did he change persons no he's still the same person he just changed his form he just moved from one place to another place you know how i've always tried to explain it brother vote you he'd say and a lot of people believe in like god uh in the backyard in uh the upper room he said it's like taking an apple and cut it up and you pass out to pieces and you run out of apple and ain't got nothing left he said that ain't it well what is it like the fish that he'd take and the bread that he handed out when he reached back there's more there was more on the day of pentecost he went from one person to 3120. that's a pretty good increase how would you like to put a few dollars in the bank if they'd let you do it you know and you'd go for that and then you'd have a pile of money in just a little bit but think about it see that's what i was trying to get across the last minute get it to the point of this one thing god never sent another person i see trinitarian concept right god never sent another person he came himself to live in his people came to die as a human being to do that he had to take on another form there's where he's declaring the father see he didn't declare the father too much in genesis and all like that but one day a man walked on the shores of galilee that man was almighty god in body he was a human element in spirit he was a spirit man but in soul it was almighty god they killed him because he said you're a man making yourself god no he was god making himself a man god manifesting himself in a man form being a person when we get dire as i say and want to go we're going to see jesus won't that be wonderful you know that's what i said i like about it because see if we're going to believe brother branham now he didn't say that hoffman was exactly he said it's close well we know close to what jesus looks like but did you catch what i said a while ago jesus looked like his father because he was his father made manifest well what are we talking about we've seen jesus the bible said we have handled with our own hands now that was when jesus came into human flesh right the disciples and the things they've washed his feet they've done the things you know they what do you think about god we're going to pick up the next one where brother brown said he goes into the next point of saying that he gave birth to his son but don't forget this he never gave birth to another person he just stepped over in another form he became the father made manifest think on these things church what are we looking at what are we trying to find brother brother said most people think that god created jesus and jesus created everything else he said now that's incorrect no god just stepped into another form and when that form was not to be say it come out it went out or run out or whatever but when it fulfilled its time he stepped into another form called the baptism of the holy ghost the same god the same jehovah god that came on the day of pentecost in the baptism of the holy ghost was the same eternal god that back before the world ever begun whatever they're doing and he said i'm going to just start this and let's see what it you know let it be right we'll get to that back into some of these brothers and pick up their thoughts what because see if you think about foreknowledge you realize how far you can go back before knowledge you go back as far as there's a god to be thought of for knowledge he didn't predestinate by his desires he predestinated by his foreign knowledge because he knew what was going to happen see but he knew that when he created man he knew he would have to die but he knew he couldn't do it in the form he was in he couldn't do it as a baby laying in a cradle or a teenager running he couldn't do it in none of that he couldn't do it in the spiritual realm and it be done that's the point that we look at remember the two creations we tried to cover spiritual realm natural realm first he created the the spirit man because it was in the image of god so what does god look like that's the man that he made that sense well enough right then coming staging stages stages just simply moving down unveiling himself now he would never be happy i'm going back to that dedication of the church god was happy with moses and the things that he done he proved it he came down they couldn't minister he proved he was happy in solomon when he came down and just you know you think about it i i remember thinking one day how many animals would be being killed in one day and just hundreds of thousands of animals being killed all of that going up and you say my morning not if you're god not if you're god and you're looking down and saying that's covering for sin but then when he looked at it he says that's covering but it'll only cover till the story is finished because david's gonna i mean solomon's gonna build me a building that's gonna stay there but it ain't gonna work i'm gonna have to step down in human flesh not send a son not another person or anything step down himself into another form and become the son of man he didn't say i'm a son of god because that was the situation to be declared later that when the bride of christ would come forth with the baptism of the holy ghost if seven church ages it would be son of god and the age is the son of god see right at the end as son of man just for a little bit now may i say it just a little bit on the thoughts you know that the son of man is the only sower of the seed according to the bible the son of man's on sword deceit son of god didn't sow no seed son of man sowed the seeds of entire new testament he sowed the seed of his bride that way he was the father he wanted to be when all of this can be comprehended and come down and dwell here with us and we can see it and then we can see just as far that away or that away and see the whole thing and say thank you lord thank you but see don't forget these things until i get back to god came himself and died for our sins he made us his offspring his children he created his own bridegroom i mean a bride the bridegroom created his own bride think on these things look all through eternity he would always be known as the i am because that would be his name but yet i am would not finish the story but jesus does brother brown says on what is what is who is this melchizedek knowing all things all places because of his omniscience on the presence he's omniscient makes him omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind he's a being he dwells in a house i remember reading here a while back not too long ago that bill gates built a 50 million house sitting on this hillside ocean side or something would that be something for a 50 million dollar house god made his out of pure gold but it's not fear gold his house is in you that was what made him happy when he could come and live what about today when he can live in his bride and she can know who she is and comprehend come on musician comprehend and all but just keep that in mind what does beginning mean to you we went from eternity to eternity and never had a starting point nor stopping point i hope you listen that way to what i'm saying i never had a starting point or a stopping point you say yeah you did because now you just go back there and you just keep on going and what about the prophet saying that he had a house well god don't need a house now we we know all of that he didn't need a temple in the wilderness he didn't need those buildings but they were put there what about it a body thou has prepared me a place for god to dwell the way he wanted it in his bride that he creates by the word think on these things let's stand together [Music] victory just think about him and what he's trying to show us no story our savior came from glory how he made [Music] anybody have a need just remember he's all in all he's always been there he always was god he was just not made known until the angels worshiped him as that word god all right but it doesn't change him he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] now we're going to have to take the whole thing of what we covered and step back and say okay now we got a beginning now we can start the creation of the world [Music] you got to get all that straight to know who he is and what's going on then you can look back and say okay now the world began [Music] but remember man was made before the world as a spiritual being [Music] one day he became a literal being person think on these things [Music] he loved me [Music] see father son and holy ghost is not three god [Music] it's three ways of that god manifesting himself [Music] or revealing himself or declaring himself [Music] it's the same one god [Music] and the old redemption and somehow hey i'll sing up there what about him he's reeling oh victory in jesus my savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me [Music]
