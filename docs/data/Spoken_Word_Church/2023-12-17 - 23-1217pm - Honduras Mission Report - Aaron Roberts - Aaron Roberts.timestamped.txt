[21:45] no uh this time we're gonna have brother
[21:48] Michael uh give a testimony for for his
[21:51] trip and uh so we're gonna let brother
[21:54] Michael speak for a few minutes before I
[21:56] start tonight but uh
[21:58] looking forward to hearing a great
[22:00] testimony brother amen God bless
[22:04] y'all
[22:06] amen um as always
[22:09] it's it's always good to be around
[22:11] Believers amen no matter what country
[22:14] you're in no matter if you speak the
[22:15] language or not uh the presence of God
[22:18] is international so it's always um you
[22:22] know especially to especially even you
[22:24] travel in the States you go to different
[22:26] churches and you know they may I know
[22:28] you may have different culture different
[22:29] you know everything's a little different
[22:31] but the spirit of God is there so even
[22:33] even in Honduras even in any you know
[22:35] any um missionary trip anywhere you go
[22:38] in the world if if God is in the people
[22:40] then you know you feel right at home and
[22:42] that's why the city is the people amen
[22:44] that's where the people are is where God
[22:45] will be and so it's wonderful to go
[22:48] there and and to talk to people and to
[22:49] be treated so nicely and the churches um
[22:52] you know the what always strikes me
[22:54] about the people is they have their
[22:56] faith they have and they have so much
[22:57] faith faith and and when they have these
[22:59] when things come upon them and and you
[23:01] know some people can't uh always afford
[23:03] a doctor or go somewhere but right even
[23:06] the people who can they choose not to
[23:09] because they believe in God they believe
[23:10] that God will provide for them and God
[23:12] will take care of them and and that's uh
[23:15] something I really took away from the
[23:17] trip is is just how many you know little
[23:20] things maybe that can be healed that we
[23:24] you know because we have so much
[23:25] technological advancement we have
[23:26] doctors that that we don't even think
[23:28] about God we say well I'll go to the
[23:30] doctor I I'll take my pill I'll take the
[23:33] medicine and we don't even think to pray
[23:35] we don't even think to you know
[23:37] just brother Bob was saying consult God
[23:40] on those things and even those little
[23:42] things I remember there was um there's a
[23:45] case of a brother a boy said he had you
[23:48] know something wrong with his eyesight
[23:50] and um and a part of me thought you know
[23:53] maybe he just needs glasses and but then
[23:56] another part of me thought well even if
[23:57] he does need glasses why should he
[23:58] accept that you know why should he just
[24:00] have to settle for that and I'm not
[24:02] saying that if you wear glasses you
[24:03] don't have faith but it's just something
[24:05] to think about some to think about those
[24:06] little things in your life where
[24:09] sometimes we don't think about it but we
[24:10] have a supernatural God and even when
[24:12] God was taking care of the the Israel in
[24:14] the desert no their clothes didn't even
[24:16] get old their shoes didn't get old every
[24:19] everything was provided for them and
[24:21] those little things like they could have
[24:22] found some you know some some uh leather
[24:24] out there somewhere and and carved up
[24:26] some you know clothes for them wear but
[24:28] God even provided for that so there was
[24:30] things that they could have got
[24:31] themselves they could have hunted but
[24:33] God gave them food and all the different
[24:35] things they needed that they could have
[24:37] got themselves but God provided for them
[24:39] so that's something I just I really took
[24:40] away from the trip is just all these
[24:41] little things that we we think aren't
[24:44] you know oh I'll just go to the doctor
[24:45] I'll do this I'll just drink I'll do
[24:46] this but but sometimes we need to
[24:48] consult God even for the even for the
[24:50] small things that we think oh maybe
[24:51] that's not important enough but God
[24:53] cares about every little thing so he'll
[24:54] take care of us and that was a big thing
[24:56] I got from the trip so God BL bless you
[24:59] [Applause]
[25:05] amen appreciate these young people
[25:09] having the desire to
[25:12] go and you
[25:15] know I was telling them that you know
[25:17] it's
[25:19] a they say it's a a
[25:22] blessing for them for us to come but I
[25:26] told them it's a it's a blessing for me
[25:28] to be there right amen and you know you
[25:31] you you think you go to bless them I I
[25:33] told them they bless me more than than I
[25:35] could have blessed them and it's just a
[25:38] wonderful thing if you have your Bibles
[25:40] I just want to read a scripture before
[25:41] we get started this evening and if you
[25:44] will stand we'll just look first first
[25:46] John chapter 1 just read a few verses
[25:49] here uh I don't know if they'll have it
[25:52] up on the screen but we'll just read
[25:54] this right quick and then we'll get
[25:55] started but uh
[25:58] as before we read the scripture let's
[25:59] just let's just
[26:01] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[26:03] this opportunity Lord to be in your
[26:06] house again Lord to gather around your
[26:08] word Lord we're just so thankful for all
[26:11] the things that you've done for us Lord
[26:13] we just can't thank you enough and we
[26:14] just pray that Lord as we take this
[26:17] service Lord Jesus that Lord what we say
[26:20] will be a blessing Lord just give you
[26:22] the honor and the praise for all that
[26:23] you've done for us Lord and Lord we just
[26:26] commit all things to you Lord just bless
[26:28] the ones that have needs Lord we just
[26:30] continue to hold them up and and believe
[26:33] Lord because we know it's a finished
[26:35] work and we just just continue to walk
[26:37] in that in that understanding and that
[26:39] Faith Lord that you've given us Lord
[26:42] Lord that because as the prophet said if
[26:44] he was standing here right if Jesus was
[26:46] standing right here right now he
[26:48] couldn't do more for us than what he's
[26:49] already done if we could just open our
[26:52] minds to receive that Lord Jesus Lord
[26:55] because it's a finished work amen and or
[26:57] we just got to walk into it and believe
[26:59] it Lord we commit ourselves into your
[27:01] hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[27:05] first John chapter 1 verse three and it
[27:09] says that which we have seen and heard
[27:11] declare we unto you that ye Also may
[27:14] have fellowship with us and truly our
[27:16] fellowship is with the father and with
[27:18] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[27:21] are right we unto you that your joy may
[27:22] be full and then this then is the
[27:26] message that we have that we have heard
[27:28] of him and declare unto you that God is
[27:30] light in him is no Darkness at all if we
[27:34] say that we have fellowship with him and
[27:36] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[27:38] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[27:40] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[27:42] with another and the blood of Jesus
[27:44] Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
[27:47] amen God bless you this

[33:39] but uh you know we all we all come from
[33:41] we all came from the same place I mean
[33:44] you know all started in the Book of
[33:45] Genesis so that's where we all came from
[33:47] you whether whether you want to believe
[33:49] it or not but if you start falling it
[33:50] back far enough you start to see all
[33:51] kinds of things show up but uh you know
[33:55] we appreciate them there they're really
[33:58] talented and really blessed and they
[34:00] they do a a great work over there so um
[34:04] yeah on uh so I left on the on the 1 of
[34:07] uh December and
[34:10] uh I I thought I was going to have a
[34:12] layover in
[34:14] uh in Houston because because of the the
[34:18] flight that I took I flew from Atlanta
[34:21] to Houston and then flew from there into
[34:25] pomarola and I thought I was going to
[34:27] have a layover but we waited 15 minutes
[34:29] at the gate and then we waited 20
[34:32] minutes on the runway trying to get out
[34:35] of Atlanta because they had backed up
[34:37] because they had storms and it had
[34:40] delayed flights and so by the time I
[34:43] thought I was going to have a layover by
[34:44] the time I got to Houston it was a It
[34:46] Was a Race cuz we were running and you
[34:49] don't know where you're going and there
[34:51] was a black lady that was in the airport
[34:53] and she was just directing traffic and
[34:55] she was just yelling and pointing
[34:57] and you're trying to jump from one sky
[34:59] train to the next one to the next one to
[35:02] get to where
[35:03] you're uh where your gate is and man it
[35:07] was a it was a hustle trying to get
[35:10] there and you know I was
[35:12] like you know it's just like I hope this
[35:15] ain't the way the whole trip goes but
[35:16] it's just like you're just racing racing
[35:18] racing just and you finally get to the
[35:20] gate and they're already boarding the
[35:22] plane and I was one of the last people
[35:23] to get on the plane and like praise the
[35:25] Lord we're on the way so
[35:28] and uh but yeah when I when I got to my
[35:30] gate I was about there was I think there
[35:32] was two people on the plane and we had a
[35:35] flight attendant that was white and
[35:36] everybody else was uh Hispanic with with
[35:40] there was three of us that spoke English
[35:42] and you know most everybody was
[35:44] bilingual but everybody was speaking
[35:45] Spanish on the on the plane but it was
[35:48] it was a good good flight uh we did have
[35:51] hit a little turbulence going into
[35:54] Honduras and there was a few times the
[35:57] the pilot told the flight attendants to
[35:59] sit down and uh the last time I went on
[36:02] a mission trip I went with brother Wade
[36:03] and we went to Jamaica and uh I thought
[36:06] the plane was going to fall out of the
[36:08] sky we went brother brother Brad pal and
[36:11] uh Brother Brad was praying I was
[36:14] singing and brother Wade was speaking
[36:16] the word and that's what kept kept us in
[36:19] the in the skies because it was it was
[36:22] it was a ride as the first flight I ever
[36:25] been on and I thought this thought thing
[36:27] was going to fall out of the sky and uh
[36:29] but this time it was it was a little bit
[36:31] rough just there for a while but after
[36:33] we got further down it cleared up and it
[36:36] was just clear sailing
[36:38] but I was like I don't know if the the
[36:41] Lord's trying to tell me something but
[36:43] these these rough I mean I we flew out
[36:45] west to Denver different places and you
[36:48] go on a go on a missionary trip and it
[36:50] sound like you know the whole back end
[36:52] of the plane just bouncing all over the
[36:53] place and I was like I don't know if
[36:55] this is a good sign or a bad sign
[36:57] but but I just thank the Lord that he
[37:00] got us there
[37:01] and so this is this is a if y'all don't
[37:04] know where Honduras is there's Honduras
[37:07] and was just north of Nicaragua El
[37:09] Salvador is there Guatemala Costa Rica
[37:11] and then Panama's further south and you
[37:13] hit Colombia in South America and then
[37:16] right above there was bise and
[37:19] Mexico and uh I told them I was like
[37:22] because they were asking me about some
[37:23] of these countries and I told them I
[37:24] said I graduated 31 years years ago my
[37:28] geography is I exactly exactly that's
[37:32] the reason we have Google Maps we don't
[37:35] have to I don't have to I mean at one
[37:37] time I knew where these countries were I
[37:39] could tell you but I couldn't tell you
[37:41] anything about them now but uh we just
[37:43] thank the Lord that the Lord got us
[37:45] there and it was it was really a
[37:48] wonderful time and we just appreciate
[37:50] the Lord
[37:51] and so there's where I got in and y'all
[37:54] seen some of the videos of of us
[37:57] arriving and so uh I got to meet brother
[38:01] Eric In the Flesh and when we got there
[38:03] I got to see sister Beck and there's
[38:05] olum and uh ol ol didn't want to have

[38:21] when you get there and you having to go
[38:23] through customs and they're fing out you

[38:27] well they give me this paperwork on the
[38:29] plane to fill out but it's on your on
[38:30] your phone give you an app to fill out
[38:32] and so I fill tried to fill it out and
[38:35] it didn't work right so I had to get in
[38:36] the airport and I found this young young
[38:38] man who spoke English and he was able to
[38:40] help me get that done and then when I
[38:42] got to the gate uh for the Immigration
[38:46] Man to give and I gave him my passport
[38:47] and then he started asking man I thought

[39:00] come up started asking me where I was
[39:01] going and where I was coming from and I
[39:03] was like I already answered all these
[39:05] questions and so they were trying to get
[39:07] me to fill out something else and then I
[39:09] waited for a while then he took my
[39:11] passport and disappeared for a while and
[39:13] he finally brought my passport back and
[39:14] stamped it and let me go so I don't I

[47:55] parents and the little
[47:56] girl and she let me hold her for about
[47:59] 30
[48:00] seconds and uh that's that was about as
[48:03] long she wanted me to have anything to
[48:05] do with her
[48:07] but I got to meet a number of the
[48:09] Believers there and that was that was
[48:10] really nice and there's all the
[48:13] Believers and then some of the family
[48:14] also that was in the picture
[48:17] and it was really blessing to me that
[48:20] they asked me to pray over the little
[48:22] girl and the family and dedicate her to
[48:24] the Lord and
[48:26] and uh you saw the video of it you know
[48:29] I told him I said brother Dale's always
[48:30] said that you know when we go to
[48:32] dedicate children we dedicate Our Lives
[48:34] to live the right kind of life before
[48:36] these
[48:37] children and it's not just dedicating
[48:40] mom and dad to raise a child but all of
[48:42] us are
[48:43] responsible for living the right kind of
[48:45] life before the
[48:47] children and so that's what I was
[48:49] telling we all dedicate ourselves to be
[48:51] the right kind of
[48:52] people and when they look for an example
[48:55] they can find
[48:56] one and so that was the pictures there
[49:00] and then another part of the uh the park
[49:04] uh you you go into and they have the
[49:06] hall or the plaza of confucious so they
[49:09] have a a a there's confucious there's a
[49:12] little Plaza area little Park in the
[49:15] park and it's really nice looking place
[49:17] and there's confucious and then they
[49:19] have the plaza of the
[49:21] philosophers and so there's different uh
[49:24] statues of you
[49:26] the bust of the different philosophers
[49:28] that you go through like Plato and the
[49:30] different ones and they tell you all
[49:32] about that but uh I was telling brother
[49:34] Luis I thought was really interesting
[49:36] because you go past confucious and the
[49:38] philosophers and you got to walk this
[49:40] winding
[49:42] pathway up and you keep walking and
[49:45] walking and walking coming all these
[49:46] steps and all the way around and you
[49:49] come to this place and you reach
[49:52] Christ if you leave if you leave
[49:54] philosophy be behind and all the world
[49:57] religions and all this kind of
[49:59] stuff there's a pathway it's not easy
[50:03] but you keep walking and you can find
[50:04] the Risen
[50:07] Savior and there he is at the
[50:10] top and I just thought that was that was
[50:13] really amazing we got to go up there and
[50:14] see that and that's the city at
[50:18] toosa and those people are packed in
[50:21] there it's amazing how you know you just
[50:24] start to look and it's just
[50:26] houses stacked up against each other
[50:28] little shacks and stuff but it was just
[50:30] just amazing how compact everything's in
[50:33] there but it was a it was really a nice
[50:37] uh beautiful place to go and and visit
[50:40] and then we're passing through the town
[50:42] and we're in toosa going through there
[50:44] and I want to show this because uh if
[50:47] you see the sign there's Burger King
[50:49] Church's Chicken and Little Caesars all
[50:52] on one little sign right there and uh
[50:55] and then the other one that's that's
[50:57] their Starbucks espresso Americano
[50:59] that's their that's the Starbucks that
[51:01] they have and uh been went to several of
[51:05] those well is over there everybody when
[51:08] you go anywhere they won't take you to
[51:09] get coffee and that's where they won't
[51:10] take you and
[51:13] uh there he
[51:15] is brother brother Wade said you look
[51:17] for miracles well I found one I got I
[51:20] got to hold him for a little while I got
[51:21] to hold him twice in while we were over
[51:23] there but he he didn't he didn't care
[51:24] for my hat too much but uh I got to hold
[51:27] him for a little bit and uh got to walk
[51:29] around with him and uh he got brother
[51:32] Eric got some pictures of that but it
[51:34] was a really good time and then this is
[51:37] the second one brother Salvador's
[51:39] daughter sister Sharon sister Sharon yes
[51:42] sister Sharon she had a birthday party
[51:45] that night and so we got to go by and
[51:47] visit with them and
[51:50] um one of the things I I wanted to do
[51:53] was uh try to find songs the the the
[51:58] hymns that were in Spanish the the
[52:00] Spanish words and we went to Brother
[52:01] Salvador's house and he had he had a
[52:04] song book and I got to take pictures of
[52:06] it and uh one of the things that when I
[52:09] was over
[52:10] there and uh I was praying one
[52:14] night and the Lord laid a song on my
[52:18] heart and just about everywhere I went I
[52:21] sang on the wings of a of a dove but I
[52:23] had I wanted them to sing it
[52:25] too and it's so beautiful and uh I love
[52:29] that song on the wings of a snow white
[52:31] dove and uh I'm trying to learn that in
[52:35] Spanish but that was that was my song
[52:37] but I had I got the words to the song
[52:39] and uh they really helped me with that
[52:41] and uh but uh uh hopefully I can and
[52:46] learn some of the songs of the same
[52:47] songs that we sing you know they they
[52:50] changed them you know they have them in
[52:51] the Spanish language also and uh so
[52:53] Sunday morning this is Brother Eric
[52:55] Church uh but the Shalom Tabernacle and
[53:00] the outside of it there and uh there's
[53:04] Brother Louis and I ministering Sunday
[53:07] morning and uh we had a had a really
[53:10] good time and I preached a message on a
[53:14] place of
[53:15] refuge and uh brother Eric told me that
[53:18] he said afterwards he said people were
[53:20] still talking about that message it
[53:21] really it really spoke to a lot of
[53:23] people
[53:24] so
[53:25] and
[53:26] uh it was uh really a blessing to have
[53:30] brother Lise he's my he's my interpreter
[53:33] and I told everybody that he was my he
[53:35] was my mouth and ears everywhere I went
[53:38] and uh because people wanted to speak to
[53:40] me and I had had no idea what they were
[53:42] saying or but he always took care of me
[53:45] and so Sunday afternoon after we ate we
[53:48] were going to brother Elise Church in
[53:50] husa so we had to leave and drive and
[53:52] that's like 3 three and a half hour

[54:51] communicate we had to we tried to try to
[54:54] act it out and he just give me this we

[55:12] one of us well I was talking and I was
[55:15] trying to get him to understand and he
[55:18] did he did respond some so but he's he's
[55:21] just a precious brother and uh he was
[55:24] one he was one of the brother brothers
[55:25] that was in the uh in the Youth Camp
[55:28] when they uh they had the meeting with
[55:31] the uh for the young people and uh they
[55:35] they broke up into small groups in the
[55:36] in the uh in the youth camp and uh he
[55:40] was one of the brothers that led one of
[55:41] the small groups uh that's the National
[55:44] Police and hey I found a sign it set
[55:46] America on it and and all of Honda say
[55:50] America it's like that was the one thing
[55:52] and uh but um
[55:55] everywhere you go they have the the they
[55:58] have uh just roadblocks set up you know
[56:00] they just have like stations set up for
[56:02] the National Police they just different
[56:04] places and they just got you see these
[56:05] blue Road cones set up and they've got
[56:09] uh speed bumps and when you get to that
[56:12] place then you uh know that you've uh
[56:14] got to slow down and sometimes the cops
[56:17] are there sometimes they're not and
[56:18] sometimes they'll stop you and sometimes
[56:20] they won't but you just roll down your
[56:22] windows and drive real slow past the
[56:24] past the and police and then and then
[56:26] you go
[56:27] on but uh they're they're everywhere and
[56:31] uh sometimes you'll see them driving
[56:32] buying trucks and I mean they all all
[56:35] SWAT teed out you mean they're and uh
[56:38] especially when we got down toward uh
[56:40] San Lorenzo toward El Salvador the
[56:43] Border uh you see them moving you know
[56:46] out doing a lot more because of people
[56:49] uh coming across the border and
[56:50] everything but uh on the way up uh I had
[56:53] several pictures of this but I just
[56:55] wanted to show you this this is in the
[56:56] city of kakamas and uh this is this is
[56:59] their welcome
[57:00] sign they have these great big colorful
[57:03] letters and they got a little Park this
[57:04] is like a roundabout there in the middle
[57:06] of the city and we stopped on the way up
[57:09] and uh we got got our picture made there
[57:12] but uh Tonga and uh to
[57:17] uh I can't remember there were several
[57:19] cities but we went into and they all had
[57:21] the same same thing there's all of us
[57:23] together and uh
[57:25] and then we were up at brother elise's
[57:27] church that night preaching and there's
[57:31] brother Elise standing up in the over by
[57:33] the wall and I got to meet brother uh
[57:37] margarito and brother uh nect that night
[57:42] and that's a really just a real Precious
[57:45] group of people up there and uh brother
[57:49] Lise told me he said brother he said I
[57:50] could tell you was tired and I was like
[57:52] I was cuz I preached Sunday morning
[57:55] and then you drive three three and a
[57:56] half hours and you try to preach at
[57:58] night I was already I was already tired
[58:01] when I got there and uh but it was it
[58:04] was a really a great service I I think
[58:06] the Lord really blessed it and uh it was
[58:08] it was a blessing to me so uh and then
[58:12] here's here's so there's brother
[58:14] margarito in the in the in the glasses
[58:16] and then brother edras and then brother
[58:18] Eli standing next to me and Manuel and
[58:21] then that's brother Nick and brother
[58:23] Louise all ministers so brother nect is
[58:27] a pastor and then brother Eli has the
[58:29] church there and really he's really he's
[58:32] an evangelist but he's pastoring that
[58:34] church because they don't have anybody
[58:35] and then brother margarito and uh
[58:38] brother margarito is a character you uh
[58:41] you meet him and uh you'll never forget
[58:43] him he's a he's he's a real comical guy
[58:46] and he's a just a real Precious brother
[58:48] and I really just had a great time

[59:17] who I didn't know what he said or what
[59:20] or or what but he was he was a wonderful
[59:22] brother and I was thinking maybe he's
[59:23] related to him you know I thought maybe
[59:25] that's a family member or something and
[59:26] brother Lis said no that's brother Ed
[59:29] Edgardo and brother Edgardo is a is a
[59:32] songwriter and a singer and I didn't I
[59:35] didn't know anything about him but I

[1:00:05] the Lord and he's just a real Precious
[1:00:07] brother and we had a great time and then
[1:00:10] the next day we were headed back and uh
[1:00:13] brother Lee and his family's in and this
[1:00:15] is Brother Lee's Truck and we're just
[1:00:17] everybody's packed in there and they're
[1:00:18] hauling all the stuff back because
[1:00:20] they're coming from the mountains
[1:00:22] they're coming to Tonga and they spent
[1:00:23] the night and all brothers were going to
[1:00:26] the ministers meeting so we're headed
[1:00:27] south from the north so everybody's
[1:00:30] packed up and they're all headed back
[1:00:33] but U that was it was a good good time
[1:00:36] fellowship and really just really
[1:00:39] precious and
[1:00:41] uh this is this is a picture I wanted to
[1:00:44] show everybody when you when you get up
[1:00:45] in the northern part of Honduras
[1:00:48] um it's lot of pine trees a lot of
[1:00:52] mountains and I showed picture people
[1:00:54] pictures that I've got and uh you'd be
[1:00:57] amazed that cuz I was thinking this is
[1:00:59] like uh looks like Georgia or North
[1:01:02] Carolina or anything like that because
[1:01:04] people were asking me where these
[1:01:05] pictures were and I showed them and said
[1:01:07] this is all Honduras and people couldn't
[1:01:09] believe that you know and so on our way
[1:01:11] back this is one of the this is a this
[1:01:14] is a department right Alano is a
[1:01:16] department so there's they're kind of
[1:01:18] like counties in Honduras the C but they
[1:01:20] call them departments and uh so I was
[1:01:22] showing this one and we all stopped got
[1:01:25] a picture made Sarah wanted me to let
[1:01:26] everybody know cuz she didn't she didn't
[1:01:28] realize that at first that's bullet
[1:01:30] holes because of the uh because of the
[1:01:34] drug traffic in that area uh they use
[1:01:36] that for target practice and all that
[1:01:39] all that's riddle that's all you know
[1:01:41] metal uh letters and this hole riddled
[1:01:43] with bullet holes but uh you know they
[1:01:46] people didn't realize what that was but
[1:01:48] um it was a nice place and uh I put this
[1:01:52] one in there for one reason sister Chris
[1:01:54] likes to take photos and videos of
[1:01:56] people that you don't know she's I had
[1:01:58] to wait because I didn't have WiFi so I
[1:02:02] had to wait till I got to WiFi and then
[1:02:04] I would go to the WhatsApp to find out
[1:02:06] exactly what Sister Christine had posted
[1:02:09] cuz I didn't know what was going on so
[1:02:12] it was it was always it was always a new
[1:02:14] thing because I was like well I know I'm
[1:02:16] going to be on there but I don't know
[1:02:17] what what she posted so anyway we were
[1:02:20] driving back and they were asleep and I
[1:02:21] was like hey look here I got I got a
[1:02:23] picture of y'all
[1:02:25] but uh yeah it was it was really a good
[1:02:28] Tri uh brother brother nect one of the
[1:02:31] pastors he has a store we stopped by his
[1:02:33] store and uh got to got to see them and
[1:02:36] the some of the family and it was uh got
[1:02:39] something to drink and and all that and
[1:02:41] fellowship with them and then brother
[1:02:43] nect wanted to show us his church and
[1:02:45] there's that's brother nct's church and
[1:02:48] uh it's a really really nice built
[1:02:50] church and really uh Lord really bless
[1:02:54] them and this is the inside of the
[1:02:55] church and uh beautiful church and he
[1:02:59] built they built the the benches and the
[1:03:02] pull Pit and the pull pit has a carved
[1:03:05] eagle on the front of it and uh I told
[1:03:07] Brother Lis I said Brother Gary CR would
[1:03:10] have loved that place because that man
[1:03:12] he is a he is a he's a Craftsman when it
[1:03:15] comes to uh being a carpenter he said
[1:03:17] his dad was a carpenter he really done a
[1:03:19] wonderful job on the pull pit and
[1:03:20] everything was beautiful but I wanted to
[1:03:22] show this one also uh just about Church
[1:03:24] you go to you always find the seven
[1:03:27] Church ages and the statue of a perfect
[1:03:29] man is almost in every church we went to
[1:03:32] they had both of those up in in the pull
[1:03:34] pit and and almost every church has a
[1:03:37] picture of the Hoffman's head of Christ
[1:03:40] and brother Brandon with a pillar of
[1:03:41] fire over his head almost all of them
[1:03:43] have that kind of set up and sometimes
[1:03:46] it's not behind the pull pit sometimes
[1:03:48] it's to the side but usually you if you
[1:03:50] go to around the pull pits you'll
[1:03:52] usually find all those pictures but um
[1:03:54] so we made it
[1:03:56] back
[1:03:58] um this was Tuesday morning and I wanted
[1:04:01] to show you some of the food Tuesday
[1:04:03] morning we because we got back Monday
[1:04:06] night and I got woke up real early uh
[1:04:09] Tuesday morning brother Eric come
[1:04:11] knocked on the door and he asked me said
[1:04:13] uh do you want to preach on the on the
[1:04:16] TV and I had to think a minute what he
[1:04:19] said you want to preach on the TV I was
[1:04:21] like well um I guess so and he he said
[1:04:24] brother Lucas has got a TV show and he

[1:04:34] woke up and we got to be leaving in like
[1:04:36] 25 minutes or something so we headed
[1:04:38] down there and uh what happened was uh
[1:04:42] they had a bucks accident and I think
[1:04:44] there was 68 people on the bus and 13 of
[1:04:46] them were killed and because of the news
[1:04:50] uh was doing live coverage of the
[1:04:52] accident we weren't able to get on the
[1:04:53] news Ed but brother L Lucas took us to
[1:04:56] to a restaurant to eat and uh so this is
[1:04:59] this was breakfast and uh eat a lot of
[1:05:02] plantains and and I I really enjoyed

[1:06:28] the back side of the house and his his
[1:06:32] mom and dad live there and this this is
[1:06:34] where his house is but uh I just wanted
[1:06:37] to show you U kind of where we were at
[1:06:40] and uh this is uh us traveling
[1:06:44] from a Tuesday morning we we got up went
[1:06:47] to the air the uh TV station and sat
[1:06:50] around for a while and got to fellowship
[1:06:51] with brother Lucas and them and then
[1:06:53] that afternoon we left headed for San
[1:06:56] Lorenzo and this is a this is a trap com
[1:06:59] uh the trip coming down to the ministers
[1:07:01] meeting and uh it's a long long trip but
[1:07:06] uh we got to see a lot of things and um
[1:07:10] you know if if you've never been
[1:07:12] overseas and and seen the the traveling
[1:07:15] that that some of the areas that you got
[1:07:17] to travel in it's like when I went to
[1:07:19] Jamaica and you know it's like you hit
[1:07:20] potholes and you know we think potholes
[1:07:22] are just little things that shake your
[1:07:23] veh vehicle and then you there's
[1:07:25] potholes that the whole car goes into
[1:07:28] and uh that's that's the kind of roads
[1:07:30] that we were there were you know you see
[1:07:32] but what's amazing like in Jamaica you
[1:07:34] hit these big holes and it's like the
[1:07:36] whole car goes in the but in in Honduras
[1:07:38] the the difference is when you're in
[1:07:40] Honduras the the roads where the whole
[1:07:43] car goes in then you come out of this
[1:07:45] ditch this Gully and they have speed
[1:07:50] bumps there were roads that I mean um
[1:07:54] for those of for those of you that have
[1:07:56] been on the Father's Day fishing trip
[1:07:58] when we used to go up to low gap and go
[1:08:01] go camping out there that's the kind of
[1:08:03] roads and and I asked one of the
[1:08:05] brothers asked me said you ever been on
[1:08:07] a road like this and I was like yeah
[1:08:08] this is when we go camping or hunting or
[1:08:10] something like this these are not roads
[1:08:11] that connect cities
[1:08:15] together but that's that's the kind of
[1:08:17] roads and uh you know it's it's just you
[1:08:21] you sometimes you just pray it's it's
[1:08:24] amazing that their their cars stay
[1:08:26] together but uh this is this is the
[1:08:28] ministers meeting uh Wednesday this
[1:08:31] Wednesday morning when we got to the and
[1:08:34] uh I didn't want but Sister Christine
[1:08:36] being being the friend that she is she
[1:08:38] kept telling me how hot it's going to be
[1:08:39] how hot it's going to be how hot it's
[1:08:41] going to be and I didn't want anybody I
[1:08:42] just block that out of my mind but she

[1:10:47] welcomed me there Tuesday night at the
[1:10:50] at the the meeting so the ministers have
[1:10:53] this meeting and then just beyond the
[1:10:55] tent on the other side is they have a
[1:10:56] big tent set up and at night everybody's
[1:10:59] welcome and they have the different
[1:11:00] brothers that come and and preach and
[1:11:02] brother Paco preached Tuesday night and
[1:11:04] they welcomed me there and he told me
[1:11:06] brother Aaron was there and then I had
[1:11:08] people coming up to me started talking I
[1:11:09] didn't have no idea what they were
[1:11:11] saying so I tried to find somebody and
[1:11:12] they finally found I think brother Luis
[1:11:14] or brother Eric somebody interpreted for
[1:11:16] me and come to find out brother Aaron
[1:11:20] mcari had been there 20 years ago and
[1:11:23] preach and when they said brother Aaron
[1:11:24] was here they they got me mixed up with
[1:11:26] brother Aaron
[1:11:27] McGary and I and I told him I said
[1:11:29] obviously y'all don't remember what
[1:11:30] brother Aaron looked
[1:11:33] like I was like because one of us is
[1:11:36] significantly well I wouldn't say
[1:11:37] significantly noticeably taller than the
[1:11:39] other one one of one of us one of us is
[1:11:42] a little bit uh there's there's a
[1:11:43] noticeable difference in size and and
[1:11:46] height but uh yeah they they want to
[1:11:48] know if I was the if I was the brother
[1:11:49] Aaron and I was like no there's a
[1:11:52] difference but uh the they were really
[1:11:54] precious Brothers I I really enjoyed it
[1:11:56] and U there was a the brother with
[1:11:59] sitting with his back to you there on
[1:12:00] the far left of the of the screen
[1:12:03] brother that's brother Santos I believe
[1:12:05] is his brother's name and uh brother
[1:12:07] Santos is like 70 years old and he's
[1:12:10] still going rides on a motorcycle and he
[1:12:14] he is just still going out and
[1:12:16] evangelizing he's an evangelist and
[1:12:19] nothing slows that man down and uh
[1:12:21] brother Lis was talking about it several
[1:12:24] two years ago something like that he can
[1:12:25] probably tell you more about it but
[1:12:27] brother Santos was in a in a motorcycle
[1:12:29] wreck and didn't break a bone he just
[1:12:32] got scratched up just a little bit
[1:12:34] motorcyc motorcycle fell on him and uh
[1:12:38] but he uh I was he's uh he sent out a
[1:12:42] letter I got the letter give it to all
[1:12:44] the pastors they're they're raising
[1:12:45] money to build another church in a Chula
[1:12:49] and I I give brother Santos I just you
[1:12:54] know always always real careful about
[1:12:57] giving money to people about for
[1:12:58] different things and and I talk brother
[1:13:00] Eric brother Eric said brother if you
[1:13:01] want to give him money you feel led you
[1:13:03] can give him some money so I gave him I
[1:13:06] gave him some am all I had was American
[1:13:08] money but I gave him some and I told
[1:13:11] Brother I walked up to brother Santos he
[1:13:13] was by himself it was just me and him
[1:13:15] and I walked up to him and I told I was
[1:13:17] pointing to the letters that he had and
[1:13:18] I told him I said elaia and I give him
[1:13:20] the money and he said elcia I said see
[1:13:24] and then so he counted the money and it
[1:13:26] just he broke down
[1:13:29] and I thought he was going to squeeze me
[1:13:31] so hard I was going to stop
[1:13:34] breathing
[1:13:36] but he just stood there and just praise
[1:13:39] the Lord amen and so y'all y'all
[1:13:43] remember them I know there's people that
[1:13:45] you know they need a lot of help over
[1:13:46] there and and so we just give them a
[1:13:50] down payment and maybe the Lord find
[1:13:54] somebody else to help just put all
[1:13:56] together and you know everybody's I
[1:13:58] heard one of the brothers that was
[1:13:59] talking about trying to find people to
[1:14:01] just give a certain amount a certain
[1:14:03] amount you know if we just had 10 people
[1:14:04] to give an X number of
[1:14:06] dollars I was like we just you know if
[1:14:09] everybody just give a little bit of
[1:14:10] something you know just a small amount
[1:14:13] brother bisco was talking about if just
[1:14:15] everybody just gives a small portion we
[1:14:18] don't need because brother Bisal said
[1:14:19] one time that he said the most faithful
[1:14:22] that he saw
[1:14:23] was the people that didn't make a lot of
[1:14:25] money but they were the most faithful
[1:14:26] and given to the missions and it's not
[1:14:29] the not the ones that have great deal of
[1:14:31] money you'd think they would be the ones
[1:14:32] giving the most but he said I've seen
[1:14:34] people that just barely get by but the
[1:14:36] Lord's always blessed them to be because
[1:14:38] they're so faithful and putting money
[1:14:40] into the into the the missions and I was
[1:14:43] like well we just give them a little bit
[1:14:45] and then uh the Lord just blessed cuz
[1:14:48] that's all it takes to just give him a
[1:14:49] little bit and he'll take the rest just
[1:14:52] like he done the fishes and the loaves
[1:14:53] it just takes a little bit and uh we
[1:14:56] were in San
[1:14:57] Lorenzo and this this right here is is a
[1:15:00] lifesaver and I don't I I I don't I just
[1:15:03] I just you just can't say enough about
[1:15:05] this this is purified water you can't
[1:15:08] drink the water there but there's a lot
[1:15:10] of purified water but the what's nice
[1:15:11] about this right here this is
[1:15:14] cold this comes in a
[1:15:16] bag and so they come in a little bag
[1:15:18] about this big and it comes in a plastic
[1:15:21] bag a clear plastic bag about the size
[1:15:22] of 5 G
[1:15:23] bucket and you get a lot of water over
[1:15:25] there that's not cold but those right
[1:15:28] there almost always were cold and I I
[1:15:31] appreciate the Lord that was that was a
[1:15:33] real blessing and uh if you could get
[1:15:35] your hands on one of them and uh people
[1:15:38] just take them and you just tear the
[1:15:39] corner off of them and you just suck
[1:15:41] suck all the water out of it
[1:15:43] and that was that was a that was a
[1:15:46] lifesaver it's so hot you're just
[1:15:49] sweltering and if somebody will bring
[1:15:51] you one of those bags right there I've
[1:15:53] seen I've seen the brothers sitting in
[1:15:54] the in the in the ministers meetings and
[1:15:57] some of those Brothers they took them
[1:15:58] and they would just sit there in the
[1:15:59] church and they'd have them sit on the
[1:16:01] back of their necks like this the whole
[1:16:03] time they were just sitting there trying
[1:16:05] to cool off but I tell you what that was
[1:16:07] a that was a blessing to have and uh I

[1:25:17] what he's doing he just canceled brother
[1:25:18] Paco's visa and sent him back to

[1:31:11] true color of the of the church I said

[1:31:16] I didn't realize till later but when
[1:31:18] when they do that they he changes the
[1:31:20] back the backdrop of the church because
[1:31:22] he's using a green screen so he puts
[1:31:24] different things on there but uh I
[1:31:27] preached on I preached on the sound of
[1:31:28] the abundance of rain that that Sunday
[1:31:31] morning and
[1:31:33] uh I was talking about you know because
[1:31:37] of the Judgment that come upon Israel
[1:31:39] you know God told Elijah that they was
[1:31:41] going to stop the rain but he had you
[1:31:44] know Elijah went to to the brook and
[1:31:46] then he prepared a widow woman to come
[1:31:49] and God brought the word to that widow
[1:31:51] woman woman to sustain her and you know
[1:31:55] I was I was talking about that widow
[1:31:57] woman and giving out of her out of her
[1:31:59] lack and of all of of her need and yet
[1:32:01] she gave to the prophet to to help and
[1:32:05] because she obeyed the word and she was
[1:32:08] blessed and then after the service was
[1:32:11] over with brother beckon was telling me
[1:32:13] that his grandmother was the first one
[1:32:16] to he hear the message and she was a
[1:32:19] young Widow and she had I think four or
[1:32:22] five children and had very little to do
[1:32:27] had very little means but she wanted to
[1:32:29] have a place that they could hear the
[1:32:32] word preached and she saved up her money
[1:32:35] didn't tell anybody but she saved up her
[1:32:37] money and had a little church area built
[1:32:39] right above where brother beckon church
[1:32:41] is and it was just a little place and
[1:32:43] it's called the house of prayer and
[1:32:45] brother Melco from toosi gulpa and some
[1:32:50] of the other brothers they come and
[1:32:51] dedicated so the ministers could come
[1:32:53] and preach the message to them in that
[1:32:55] area and what struck me was I was
[1:32:58] preaching about that widow woman out of
[1:33:01] her out of her
[1:33:03] need God come and sustained
[1:33:07] her because she she obeyed the word the
[1:33:10] word come to her and she obeyed the word
[1:33:13] and not even thinking about it till
[1:33:14] later brother beckon was tell me the
[1:33:16] story about his grandmother and I was
[1:33:18] like man isn't that amazing that that
[1:33:19] God gave me that to preach that morning

[1:34:18] you to come back and when you when you
[1:34:20] get a chance to come but
[1:34:23] uh just to see what God has done and I
[1:34:27] was telling brother beckon I didn't get
[1:34:28] to tell everybody but we had Fellowship
[1:34:31] after church and I was telling brother
[1:34:32] beckon about our church and having the
[1:34:34] number of people with my family my mom
[1:34:36] grandmother when brother brandom's
[1:34:37] meetings and the different ones from our
[1:34:39] church have been brother banham's
[1:34:40] meetings and you know anointed ones at
[1:34:42] the end time brother Brams mentioned
[1:34:43] Gainesville Georgia and the different
[1:34:45] ones and uh brother George and brother
[1:34:48] Tatum and them singing on the brother Mo
[1:34:50] singing on the the the six seal and just
[1:34:53] and uh I told
[1:34:55] him I really appreciate the Legacy that
[1:34:59] we have at our church that amen what God
[1:35:01] has done in this little place amen and
[1:35:05] we're really blessed people
[1:35:08] amen and but there there really really
[1:35:11] precious people there that we able to
[1:35:12] got to
[1:35:13] go and uh so um that was Sunday morning
[1:35:17] then we come back and this is what
[1:35:19] Sunday night brother Lis is preaching
[1:35:22] but the the the mid service on Sunday
[1:35:25] they had the uh the youth service and
[1:35:27] brother uh well I can't remember what
[1:35:29] service it was but uh they had the in
[1:35:31] the youth service they they had one time
[1:35:34] they had the uh small groups and brother
[1:35:38] Paco was preaching one night and he was
[1:35:39] asking them about different things about
[1:35:41] the message and was asking them
[1:35:43] questions and the young people were
[1:35:44] having is you know struggling trying to
[1:35:46] answer some of the questions and so they
[1:35:48] had these uh little small grp group
[1:35:51] sessions and some of the young ministers
[1:35:53] that were there they took each group and
[1:35:55] they broke up uh why do we why do we
[1:35:57] baptize in in the name of Jesus by
[1:36:00] immersion and why are we not a
[1:36:01] denomination and they took different
[1:36:03] topics and you know they just kind of
[1:36:04] broke it all down and and I thought
[1:36:06] brother Lis done a really good job this
[1:36:08] was the last service and he was and he
[1:36:10] was talking about Revelation 10
[1:36:13] Revelation 5 and and the opening of the
[1:36:15] seals and the word and and I I thought
[1:36:18] brother Lis done a real good job trying
[1:36:19] to break it down for the young people
[1:36:22] for them to understand because you got
[1:36:24] to see this this message come for you
[1:36:27] and this word's got to open to you and
[1:36:30] it's not just something that took place
[1:36:31] in 1963 that happened to brother
[1:36:34] brandham but you got to see that the
[1:36:35] word the opening of the word is for you
[1:36:38] and you've got to see the word open to
[1:36:40] you just as John you know because John
[1:36:43] we but see when John was able to see his
[1:36:46] name in the book that was a revelation
[1:36:48] to him that wasn't nobody else's
[1:36:49] Revelation that was John seeing his name
[1:36:52] seeing Redemption and see brother Bram
[1:36:54] had the same experience the word had to
[1:36:56] open to him to see that you know when
[1:36:58] brother Bram standing there and said
[1:37:00] here stands a lamb with a book in his
[1:37:03] hand not their stand but he saw that the
[1:37:06] lamb was there opening the word it was a
[1:37:08] revelation to him and it was really I
[1:37:11] thought it was really good brother Luis
[1:37:12] done a great job that
[1:37:14] night and and try to get the people the
[1:37:17] young people you got to have this
[1:37:18] Revelation for yourself you got to have
[1:37:20] where the and so I thought it was good
[1:37:23] some of this some of the young people
[1:37:24] that were there this is uh brother hson
[1:37:26] and sister Danielle and they're just
[1:37:29] really precious people he speaks some

[1:40:48] it meant to be there and these people
[1:40:51] but you know we're all one in in
[1:40:53] Christ and you know that's what's so
[1:40:55] wonderful is the is the word is what
[1:40:58] unifies us together we're all baptized
[1:41:01] into one body and and I just appreciate
[1:41:03] all them and you know we all have the we
[1:41:05] all fight the same
[1:41:07] devil you know they over there they're
[1:41:09] fighting the same thing you know we've
[1:41:12] got believe the sign and everybody
[1:41:15] walking away from the message and
[1:41:16] calling brother Bram a false prophet and
[1:41:19] and you know Saturday morning when
[1:41:22] brother Eric he wanted us to cover the
[1:41:25] things that we believe what are the
[1:41:26] things that we believe in the
[1:41:28] message and one of the things I covered
[1:41:31] s Saturday morning the Lord just laid on
[1:41:34] my
[1:41:35] heart as I got up I took the life of the
[1:41:38] Apostle
[1:41:39] Paul I said here was a man that was by
[1:41:41] his own testimony was a blasphemer and a
[1:41:45] murderer and when it come time that God
[1:41:49] Called Paul into the Ministry called him
[1:41:51] into the into the mess into the
[1:41:54] word was bringing him into the kingdom
[1:41:56] of
[1:41:57] God and when he come to that place God
[1:42:01] told ananas to go pray for
[1:42:04] Saul because I've got a work for him to
[1:42:06] do and ananas is like you want me to go
[1:42:09] pray for
[1:42:11] him and I told him I said tell me
[1:42:14] anybody that you've ever seen anybody in
[1:42:17] in the scripture that God didn't use
[1:42:19] that there wasn't controversy in their
[1:42:22] life everybody there's always look look
[1:42:26] I told him I said Jesus said you talking
[1:42:29] to the Pharisees said you polish the
[1:42:31] tombs of the prophets and your fathers
[1:42:34] are the one that put them
[1:42:37] there why because they did not they
[1:42:40] rejected the word of
[1:42:42] God what they brother R said that they
[1:42:45] hated Elijah when he told them that they
[1:42:47] were not going to have any rain for
[1:42:48] three and a half
[1:42:49] years he said there wouldn't be and he
[1:42:52] said they hated him and he said what was
[1:42:53] the reason he said it wasn't Elijah he
[1:42:56] said it was because the people had
[1:42:58] turned down the word they turned their
[1:42:59] back on God and judgment came but it was
[1:43:03] just him bringing the word and I was
[1:43:05] like the same thing we see today they've
[1:43:08] turned the word down and now they're
[1:43:11] receiving judgment that's what brother
[1:43:12] brandham come to do he come to tie up
[1:43:13] the loose sins but that was what he come
[1:43:15] to bring back because the Judgment of
[1:43:17] God was
[1:43:18] coming Pentecost had walked away from
[1:43:21] the from the foundation that came on
[1:43:23] isua street they had walked away from
[1:43:26] that and that's what that's what the
[1:43:29] prophet came to do was to is to bring
[1:43:32] judgment amen but it's a fulfillment of
[1:43:35] God's word
[1:43:37] amen and just like Paul you know he come
[1:43:39] to fulfill those things but Paul stood
[1:43:41] there and said if if an angel preaches
[1:43:44] anything different than what I've
[1:43:45] already said they said let them be a
[1:43:48] cursed you know it's the same we've we'
[1:43:51] received that same Ministry amen right
[1:43:54] God done the same thing in our day yes
[1:43:56] we've had a we've had a prophet in our
[1:43:57] day that come and brought the word
[1:43:59] opened up and it wasn't it wasn't
[1:44:01] brother brandom that done it it was
[1:44:03] Jesus Christ that came in the last days
[1:44:05] to open the word to us and I told him I
[1:44:08] said you know whether anybody else
[1:44:10] believes or not that's what I believe
[1:44:12] that's what's real to
[1:44:14] me and you know I you can't convince
[1:44:17] some people of anything and that's all
[1:44:19] right but I'll give you I I'll give
[1:44:22] you an answer for the hope that lies
[1:44:25] within
[1:44:25] me and that's all you can do am amen
[1:44:29] well God bless you this evening we'll
[1:44:30] have the musicians
[1:44:35] come we're
[1:44:40] going let's all
[1:44:42] stand and I hope I didn't we you
[1:44:47] out and
[1:44:49] uh
[1:44:54] I it's kind of hard because you got so
[1:44:56] much that you want to say and I just
[1:44:59] trying
[1:45:01] to what was it the they said brevity is
[1:45:04] the soul of
[1:45:05] wit and uh some I told him that when I
[1:45:09] preach sometimes when I got when I was
[1:45:11] in Honduras I told him I said I'm sorry
[1:45:13] that I preached so long that uh I said
[1:45:16] sometimes we feel like we're Eternal and
[1:45:18] uh and I that was one thing I always
[1:45:20] tried to do was like Saturday morning I
[1:45:23] I got and I told Brother Lis you know
[1:45:26] we've only got so much time because
[1:45:27] we've got other things going on that day
[1:45:30] and because of breakfast and different
[1:45:31] things they had a late start and so I
[1:45:34] just I just put 55 minutes on my phone
[1:45:37] and I and I I told Brother Lis I said we
[1:45:39] got a whole lot to ground to cover we
[1:45:41] going we're going to try to do
[1:45:41] everything we can because we got 55
[1:45:43] minutes to get this and I just you know
[1:45:45] just and the and the problem is is when
[1:45:48] you get over there brother Elie when he
[1:45:50] preached he preached a solid hour and
[1:45:53] the man you know he don't ever seem like
[1:45:55] he takes a break he just goes goes goes
[1:45:58] and then brother Lis they done a great
[1:46:00] job and I told him I said I got to wait
[1:46:02] on y'all to interpret
[1:46:03] everything one I forgot what night it
[1:46:05] was they they uh it was at the tent
[1:46:08] Thursday night when I preached at the
[1:46:09] tent one of the brothers came up to said
[1:46:11] brother you preached two hours I said no
[1:46:12] I did not I said I preached one hour and
[1:46:15] I said Lise done the
[1:46:18] rest y
[1:46:21] I only covered so much I said the rest
[1:46:23] of it was brother Lis
[1:46:26] talking but they were they're just
[1:46:28] really precious people and and y'all
[1:46:30] just continue to hold them up in prayer
[1:46:32] and you know it's you know we we pray
[1:46:33] for the bride you know we pray for the
[1:46:36] bride around the world there's so many
[1:46:37] of them that have needs but it's
[1:46:39] something different when they when they

[1:46:43] you and they hug
[1:46:45] you you know they tell you they love you
[1:46:47] and they and they appreciate you and it
[1:46:50] just you know when you start putting
[1:46:51] names and faces together you know it
[1:46:55] it's something different there's there's
[1:46:56] something about that Fellowship together
[1:46:59] but you know I just told him I said if I
[1:47:01] don't see you on this side
[1:47:03] anymore I said we're going to see you
