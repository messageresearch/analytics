that came yesterday to the to the memorial service brother ray that uh you showed your support for um to sister kathy and and brother ray's family and we want to thank you for the effort that you put forth by coming to the to the memorial service it was a wonderful time wasn't sad we know parting is sweet sorrow but we know one thing's for sure he's not going to want to come back here we just got to make sure as david said i can't do anything about my child now but i got to make sure that i go where he is amen so that's our job and our mandate is to either if we have to pass away go where he's at or stay alive and remain and bring him back here yeah man so that's my contention is that we're gonna do that somebody will right yeah man somebody's going to do that so good to be in the house of lord brother aaron's preaching wednesday night brother bob is at blue ridge he's probably on his way back by now i think they just have one service just pray for him remember may the first as we were talking about this morning will be the bible study downstairs from six to eight o'clock in the big room uh we're going to start that back again and also on and we'll have communion that's sunday may the 2nd all right then may the 9th sunday school will commence um with all the people going if you don't know where your child needs to go or where you need to go you need to ask brother boyd sister uh monica when she gets here uh sister anna roberts and sister rachel canada where you're supposed to be they have the list now my son i'm going to be gone brother dutch scott asked me to preach for him he's not even not going to be there that sunday so i'm going to go minister for him that is mother's day but also we don't have a big enough space for me to do my sunday school class yet so we will not be doing my adult sunday school class until we figure out what we're going to do so that if that's okay with with everybody we'll just maybe postpone that for another another weekend just for my sunday school class but brother boyd sister anna sister rachel says monica your class will be not this coming sunday but the next sunday may the 9th all right so and if you have children you need to instruct them and where to go like i said if you don't know where to go ask one of the teachers and they'll tell you where they need to go also remember june the 16th through the 19th boy it's coming up may is pretty quick upon us and this year is about gone so june the 16th won't be very long but that'll be our father's day fishing trip brother ronnie long and brother chris long will be with us and then on july the 3rd and 4th brother joel forney and brother mike ulti will be here for our 50th anniversary meeting saturday night and sunday and we'll have a dinner after that everybody all right with that amen that's all the announcements if you would turn your bibles to hebrews 9 we'll continue on with with the message of eternal redemption i know i'm going at it slow but i'm just trying to i'm trying to not get ahead um sister julie likes my charts so what you got yours with you no oh huh oh she's mumbling under her mask okay i have plenty up here i have plenty if y'all need some more just get get she she wanted one last sunday i didn't get it i know you didn't i know you and it's on tape and i cannot believe you walked up this close to the to the front without fainting brother gary i wish i was humble like him but i just can't i'm just not that way i just can't we god made one and that's about it so thank god i'm talking about me not him so he everybody say man hebrews 9 11. we're going to read and continue on with our thought pick up a little extra thought today we talk about perfect love but i came upon a quote and i know it the time is accelerating if you're not reading your bible and studying more and reading the prophet's message more than you are backslid because i you know i've been we listen to sermons and we read and we do our daily devotion and we continue to keep on reading and you know i've probably read this message 20 times and i didn't see this until just the other day so it's just that's just the way god works but you know what if you'd never read it again you said well i didn't get anything out of that the first time well read it a second time and a third time you'll get something out of because you know what his word will not return void it will accomplish exactly what it said it would do all right and it will be in his decreed time and its decreed season all right so that's what we're looking at we're looking at the season of adoption or we're also looking at the season of culminating you can't really culminate eternal redemption but you can culminate redemption for the gentile bride everybody got that bride the gentile bride our culmination will be a body change here in the near future and that will take care of the gentile dispensation but god's eternal redemption will continue on on into the future home and all the way through so hebrews 9 11 let's pray before we get started dear lord thank you for this day thank you for this purpose that we have assembled here lord you told us to meet you told us to meet lord together and where two or three are gathered in your name that you will be in the midst lord i believe there's more than two or three gathered today in your name father so may you pour out a blessing that we cannot contain father that our bowl will be full and we'll go home and say well it was good that we heard from you today lord father we pray that you'd be with the ones that are not here the ones that are watching online sister mary the family there says cathy we asked you to bless them lord in the time of grief father that you're you're the prince of peace you're the only one that knows how to take care of each situation lord and i pray that you'll do that father we pray that you bless the ones here take care of us lord through this furthermore the service you be the speaker you'd be the one doing the revealing lord heal the sick but mainly lord heal the sin sick the ones that you watch lord and you watch them go backwards day by day and you we pour our heart out lord but only you will be able to touch them but lord lead us and guide us in a way lord that we'll go down maybe someone's path today and and we'll speak something that'll bring a revelation in our heart lord that will change their life and that they'll change their attitude towards you lord we pray these things lord earnestly because we're coming toward the end of this time of the gentile dispensation and lord we're showing lord that perfect love is going to have to be on the scene or or you're not going to be here lord we pray that you'd just sanctify us lord for this journey forgive us of our sins bless our pastor keep each one of them safe lord go to church here father and the ones that are in this building today lord just give us an extra strong revelation father injury we pray these things lord in earnest in jesus name amen but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us and we'll get into that a little bit later let's go to first john 4. and what what great a man would know about love than john is as in the little john's he's been to the isle of patmos he's seen the antichrist but he's also seen jesus christ he's seen the bride come to full fruition he's seen her in revelations 19 become a wife not be a bride but become a wife and he saw a future home coming down out of the heaven and now he goes back and he he's preaching you know brother brown said he was the pastor of ephesus after paul passed away he pastored ephesus church and i believe he was writing this not only to the ephesians but to us and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him hearing as our love our love made perfect because we don't know how to love like god loves our feeling of love and god's love is totally separate amen totally at the other end both ends of the spectrum hearing is our love made perfect that we may have what boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear and love but perfect love catholics out fear because fear has torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first love uh loved us if a man say i love god and hates his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word we'll continue on into ephesians but you look at that he says how can you love god whom you hath not seen how many of you have seen jesus christ in the flesh you have not seen the person jesus christ but his characteristic has been from the foundation of the world written in a bible written by prophets and is given to us in the end time by a prophet and as we were talking about um brother ray yesterday we need to get this right when we're like when you were in a mixed uh multitude of people and we just jump in and i noticed some of them brother aaron was singing that song the original life the original seed well that that's not made for a denominational world that's not made for a bad you won't hear baptist singing that in their in here in their sanctuary and but we we what we identify with it though so that's why i was trying to tell them yesterday you kind of try to soften it up a little bit and tell them that you know you just say bless god god sent a prophet you know you just dump the whole load on them you don't need to do that i was started the sermon by telling people that brother ray accepted john 3 16 first if you accept john 3 16 first and you ask god this agape love to come into your heart then you will have to in the end time see that god sent you then malachi 4 elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord and you'll turn the heart back all right well now if you'll do it that way then don't ever try to go and witness the people about william branham being a prophet because in the end time you know you might have got by with that in the 60s because it was fresh on people's mind they could say yeah i know a i know an aunt or i know an uncle i know somebody that went to the meeting that knew somebody went to the meeting we saw the miracles but now all you see is internet all you see is you know if somebody say william branham's name oh well you just put anybody's name in and google it and you're going to get something all right well you put his name in there now and you're not going to get a lot of the good right but if you'll get them to jesus christ that's what the prophet said he said i'm afraid we're not getting them to christ we're getting them to a doctrine well if if if christ is not in this message you know you know what i'm saying if christ is not the center piece of this message then you just it's nothing it's just let's just read the books just like clarence larkin or some other great person that that spoke and and you know you say well what what is it but no get them born again first do that right instead of shaking a hand as a baptist do or the sprinkling is the method that's doing the different ones get them born again see that they need to be baptized in the right way of christian baptism and then you start talking to them maybe a little bit about the message of the hour because you don't want to choke people that's what we've done brother dick always uh made a a outstanding statement very simple he said i bruised a lot of fruit which means he talked to a lot of people that you know if you're if you treat fruit really rough it doesn't last long it gets bruised you take a you take here we in the south you take a nanner everybody know what an enter is close to a mater made in a tater you take a banana though and you buy it you know and you throw it against the wall and you throw it down on the counter well it's not going to last long well that's what brother dick was talking about he was doing he was trying to really force the message onto this real soft fruit and he bruised a lot of fruit and i would say brother tom paul bush did the same thing but uh but you know what it's your zeal this you're zealous to tell them about it but you got to tell them about jesus christ first and number one you got to live the life before the people because they're going to watch it all right so that's why we look here we say who how can he love god whom he hath not seen now how can we how can we have a chart today or how can we have a bible how can we have quotes unless we have seen the manifestation of this man that had this plan of eternal redemption that it was in his mind before the foundation of the world and that that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and that everything was taken care of before the foundation of the world in the mind of god but now jesus christ had to literally come down to this earth and be crucified on a cross in these first three dimensions that we've been talking about or that would not be fulfilled because everything that's in the mind of god has to be fulfilled amen so we see now though the manifestation of that man that hung on the cross because if you don't have a personal intimate relationship with jesus christ you don't you you haven't got the person so you not act you don't act like the person all right and the person's characteristics is the bible all right everybody got that and it's really simple i want to start off like that first though because i want us to be able to to talk to people about the lord and get them solid in the lord then give them the message then then then give them have you ever read malachi 4 and they'll probably say yes i've read it but that's elijah for over yonder or that's elijah for here or that's elijah john the baptist no and then you just start piecing it together for him and it becomes a beautiful picture i think sometimes we try to slam dunk it you know and it's not going to happen like that we don't want to bruise so many fruits so let's let's go to ephesians 1 as we were speaking last sunday and read verse four according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children now brother dale's been on adoption we've talked about adoption we need to have that on our heart and our mind because it's not just that we're we're we're born again we have to come to full maturity amen and coming to full maturity comes by of jesus christ obtaining this eternal redemption for us as brother ray passed on he was part of that plan but he had to leave something here the kuckleberg had to stay the shell had to stay because it got caught in the first three dimensions as we were talking about we all got caught in these first three dimensions after jesus or after adam the first adam sold us out we were stuck in these first three dimensions and even adam his own body i was thinking about this last night and we're gonna go through this in just a minute but have you ever thought about after calvary and after the day of pentecost there's not that it's so clear where everybody goes when they pass away but now if you go to the old testament you have an enoch what happened there i don't know the prophet said he didn't know elijah carried away in a chariot moses he died but he didn't die they can't find his body you see that all happened in the old testament but when we come to the new testament when christ come and fulfilled all the law and the prophets and gave us a new testimony then we were very clear about where we were going because the man that had designed the plan was standing on earth and he said okay if you believe in me and and you know even if you die that you're going you're going to be where i am all right but now enoch and moses and elijah in the old testament under the blood of bulls and goats as we mentioned many times before that we see that there was a it was kind of a little you're under the law and it was paradise and the men were old and you understand you see what i'm saying but but that had to be part of the plan but let's not spend so much time wondering where enoch is because i believe we'll see him i don't worry about where moses and elijah is and remember it's not the literal moses and elijah that goes into the two witnesses it's the two spirit of moses and the spirit of elijah that's going to enter into these two prophets and they're going to preach after we leave so let's not worry so much about that they can't come until we leave right so we got to get ready to get out of here first and then as we get ready to get out of here he can go to the jews let's read verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood i want to read you a quote here in just a minute that will help us on that you know we we know jesus christ came and we know he died in human flesh let me read you something only a prophet could say this the way he said it verse 8 wherein he hath the bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in a dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance and we talked about that before and we'll not go over this again we're going to carry on so we don't have to go over these same scriptures we've been reading for 16 times and i hope it's not bored you because i get something out of it every time i read it in him also we have obtained an inheritance now remember remember what i told you brother brown said jesus didn't come to bring you your inheritance in other words what's brother brown saying he's saying that jesus didn't come down here on earth to develop a plan he already had the plan he came to get us back to the plan because he was the plan maker but that's what brother ram was saying he said no no no he said jesus didn't come to bring you inheritance he didn't because your inheritance was before the foundation of the world he came to make a way for you to get back to your inheritance amen and that inheritance by the new birth it comes into your soul but still there's a peace because we were stuck in three dimensions there's still a piece of you that's got to stay here i wanted to get into that yesterday but i didn't want to take up too much time of where there's terrestrial bodies and celestial bodies and even paul you know talking about being absent in the body and being present with the lord but now i'm present with you guys and i can't be with the lord he couldn't be in human what was paul saying i cannot be in human flesh and be where the lord is i'm going to have to drop this part to go see god so to be absent in the body is to be present with the lord you see that's what brother ray did yesterday he he became absent in the body human body kucleber had to stay here his shell so that he could be present with the lord he can't carry all those pieces together yet there's only one reason immortality jesus had to go to the cross die death burial resurrection he had to go to hell then he had to resurrect he had to come back on the day of pentecost so that you and i can develop the rest of this plan does everybody got that amen and the longer y'all sleep the longer i'm gonna preach my heavens people come on you put a movie on and watch it for three hours never get up and pee or nothing you just sat there that's right did you see that run that back come on some of y'all can't stay here 15 minutes without either going to sleep or going to take the bathroom we'll discuss that in just a minute too anymore i don't like to do my rallying in front of the service i want everybody to laugh and have a good time and then smack you on the rear end as you go out the door in other words by saying words like that brother dale just hammers you on top of the head and then then he preaches to you brother claude said one time he said i know there was some heads hit the floor that day but that's what a pastor is supposed to do thank goodness he's the pastor in whom also we have obtained an inheritance now what we obtained an inheritance brother ray obtained an inheritance and the reason we use him because he just passed away but he obtained that inheritance by the new birth but he has to wait for something else to develop because he had to leave a piece of him here that's why you have dimension that's why god said and i'll get to well i'll do it now you know genesis 1 26 what is that that's the new birth that is perfect love that is god's children whatever god saw and said let us make man manner our own image now that couldn't develop it could developed an atom it developed in eve is that a very right same man but that had to be closed up until the day of pentecost then when the first martyr stephen when he was martyred that genesis 1 26 developed in the sixth dimension everybody got that that's right so everything brother louise in that if you say what what's the sixth dimension it's the genesis 126 man that has not come to full maturity because what happened here is god said let us make man our own image in our own likeness and we're going to have a group of children and that group of children is going to develop and they're my children but what happened in the fall that piece of that children those children could not develop because of what adam and eve did so we had to come down here become flesh and have babies bisexual desire but god never did away with this part of genesis 1 26 man he the picture brother brown said god took a picture see now god never took a picture of donnie fall bush at 70 one he said real one that's not what he took if if and i'm saying if for you not for me if brother donny was part of that genesis 1 26 man he never took this picture this picture is not so this picture was never developed in the eternal mind of god that 92 year old woman that received the new birth that he saw in that sixth dimension as a young 20 year old woman he never took a picture of her at 90 years old 92 years old he took a picture of her when she got the new birth am i okay with that when she got born again that picture developed the old the old 90 year old woman left died and the new 20 year old moved in they're all right with that that's what happened at your new birth it wasn't just god just well god just lit my soul up no his soul is now your soul your soul is now his soul you and he can't develop an old person that genesis 1 26 man could not develop though it was before the foundation of the world though it was six or eight thousand years ago it was just as fresh today as it was when he spoke it but he knew the plan of redemption was going to have to happen he knew there was going to have to be death burial there was they knew there was going to have to be sorrow and there was going to have to be pain but he was there to heal the people he was there to be the prince of peace but he said i'll just put him right over here yeah you know there was a death angel standing next to brother ray the other night he said you're going with me no you know what spoke that new birth that genesis 1 26 man spoke that little white light brother brown said that little button that you get when you get born again it's like a little button you get in your soul he said that's what spoke the other night and brother ray if you could have heard what he said he said no i'm not going with you he said i know where i am going and you're not going with me because there's no death in there right we said we saw we we when the dead in christ shall rise first well you better be dead tonight you better be dead today if you die a natural death without christ you will not rise again except in the second resurrection which will be down the road then you'll have to give an account of what you do but that's what god did but now listen to this let's go to our first quote only mature christians know these things people have probed all during the all i mean since the beginning of time they probed it where does man go even job not born again job though being having a little prophetic vision he could see the tree die the grass dying all these different things and he could see them come back up every spring just like we do now we see it come back up he said but now man he says i see man go to the ground he said but i don't see man raised back up where does man go oh that you'd hide me lord oh and then all of a sudden he said ah there's a plan because that elihue came to to to job and all them other three spent their time accusing him right his three friends was just accusing him of being everything in the world but that fourth man came up and he said i'm going to speak just a little bit different than the rest of them he said job stand up on your feet quit crying quit crying quit crying let's get some adoption here and then when when now he didn't come to adoption like we do but when he come though to the fullness of his journey he turned around and he said i know my redeemer living and not only the revelation of that i'm going somewhere but i'm going to come back here and in my flesh i'm going to see god i hope the people the message can see that because half of them don't believe that you're going to get that same body back again but what a great miracle that god can take this old kocover and just change the atoms of it i mean that would be really easy though to just throw this one out and as i said before that a lot of people and i heard a preacher preach at one time that you know the bible says walking on the ashes of the wicked well that's because this wicked thing you're gonna walk out on your own ashes i that ain't happening to me god thought enough of me to preserve me as we were as you were reading that hide me in your pavilion until the storm pass brother ray is head i believe that when satan he will be right at your ear if you pass away he's going to be right at your ear saying you ain't going to make it you ain't nothing i got you i'm gonna kill you until until they the dimension gets a little bit faster and then brother ray disappeared and then the devil's running around looking for looking for where to go because there's no kindred spirit there's no connection to that sixth dimension so god is hiding them in their pavilion and i i i didn't say this yesterday but i was thinking about it last night you know we call everybody's name you know i call brother brother eugene collins and we call richard marlow and the different ones brother dick but you know brother brown's there too and as the vision showed they were gathered with him so so brother ray i know there's one thing for sure there was two little men met each other hey man there was two little guys met each other and they were running running around a rock somewhere and brother ray says i know what you mean now this is it see that's real folks that's not a fairy tale that might have been a lot of people yesterday thought we were just idiots and that it's just a fairy tale that this is what we don't know about this afterlife thing we just die and we don't know nothing about it but you and i by this by this prophet coming in the end time and showing us this whole plan and how perfect it is and how complete it is but he's got to have somebody in the end time to speak that though it's not just going to develop by itself the plan needs players hey man you can have the best football plan in the world or the basketball plan or whatever you want to do you can plan that baby out and you can rock your exes and your o's and you can put all this going in this direction but what do you need son you need people you need ball players to watch suit up the plan book learn the playbook so that when it's time to play the game you know what you're talking about brother brown says tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there ever a time in all of history all of history to deliver all nature because brother ray's nature you wonder what i mean the nate what he was born his shell had to stay here because he was born naturally man he was born naturally so that nature of that had to stay here but it's but nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifestation why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the old testament on down there couldn't have been manifestation think about that though look at how god took the children of israel what a manifestation they had right what about a god what about a god that knew there was only two people going to make it out of them two million that come out of egypt and he never complained about i mean sure there was a lot of things he did a lot of plagues but he still was like come on let's go i'm gonna make your clothes not wear out i'm gonna make your shoes grow with your body i'm gonna feed you every day you're not if you complain about water i'm going to not just give you a trickle i'm going to give you an artesian well and the thing is going to follow you follow you where's that what well there it is i need some there it is but he knew only two people was going to make it yet god said all right come on when you get in the promised land this is what i want you to do what a great god we serve on down it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of god coming back and the spirit of god coming into these men not one man these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ who will join him and his church together so what are we under today brothers and sisters we're not under the ministry of presuming right we think when we go to heaven this is going to happen we think there's going to be seven year tribulation we think that father son holy ghost is the right baptism we think there is an eternal hell that's what they're thinking out there because the devil's got them so confused but we're listen when jesus christ was on the earth there was not one thing unpure about his message his message was pure and unadulterated straight to the people that hated him so brother brown says until their ministry will be so close like christ what we know there's no eternal hell we know the correct baptism we know where people go when they die we know where people go when they're dying without christ we know where people we know where god is that's it it's not a hope right we have an assurity yes gloria then if you're born again there's where god is that's right i wrote myself a note you know christ brother brown said christ didn't know jesus christ didn't know all things now christ did oh jesus christ learned by the things he suffered he was made perfect why because he was a human body he was a human being had a human brain but what lived inside of him was not part of christ it was christ amen all of christ and brother brown said then though after the death of our resurrection he knew all things so now since we see that picture develop brother louise we're not looking back at that christ that walked on the shores of galilee and see that he had a human body and it was dying and he didn't know about his second coming that's what the prophet said said moses and elijah on the mountain was telling jesus about his second coming there was things that was withheld from him but now he's out of the tomb amen he's already immortal he's in the seventh dimension he's got an eternal body he knows all things now what's he going to send back on the day of pentecost something that knows just a little bit is he going to sin now though in the end time where the fullness of all things has got to come the headstone himself has got to come you think he's going to leave a piece out that's the problem there was pieces left out during the seven church ages i'm gonna say seven all seven church ages there was things that was left out but now we are living in bible prophecy we are living the bible we are not looking back we're not looking forward brother baby said you need to look at what's going on right now why because bible prophecy is being fulfilled right now today we are living under the fulfillment of bible prophecy but now so is the world so is the world they're living under bible prophecy but they're living under a different prophecy than you are because you are a prophetic being you are able to contact that prophetic god get prophetic insight be able to understand what god's telling you where the world's not going to get that right amen the world is not going to get that prophetic they're going to get the prophecy they're gonna get what's written in this book but so are we but the difference is we're born again and we can't die and god can't judge us we've already been judged but he's going to judge the world by the prophecy that he wrote in this book right here amen so the ministry of jesus christ folks is not coming it's not going to the jews it's right here right you're say yes go let them have their part let's get our part first let's believe that the ministry of jesus christ is here that there is no you say well now yeah and here we go but you go to ministers meeting the first thing people tell you they throw up they say well well they don't throw up but they throw this up to you that sometimes i would like to throw up for some of the things that they say but that don't make me hey man aaron aaron's heard it we've heard it i mean we like what where did you eat that at i'm not going to that restaurant yes come on in type in type not a real restaurant in type where did you eat that at that makes me sick but that's what we're letting somebody has got to preach the pure unadulterated word of god amen right not one word off all right amen is what brother dale said about the five full ministry it's for the what perfecting of the saints not the perfecting of jesus christ he's already perfect but for the perfecting of the saints that we can come to adoption i saw a little snippet in there a few minutes ago brother keith reed you can watch him online and on facebook and i was watching him a few minutes ago but he he was it's not something to come folks it's here this manifestation is here now and and like i said before some people are missing it some me and somebody was talking yesterday some people are literally missing it and sitting right here in the seat and you try and try and try but only god can change you only god can change me but there has got to be i would love for people to begin hunting the truth instead of being i'm talking about you i'm talking about you all of you you need to hunt the truth the truth's not going to come to you you got to have a desire because god will only what he'll only deal with your desire what you desire well i'm fine because i'm in this person's church and he's like the number two people uh on youtube and he's got 800 people in his church he's got to be right i'm not saying one way or the other i'm just saying why do we use those markers where the church of ephesus had 12 people in it paul passed away and john took over and pastor tilly was 90 something years old you got a long time left buddy you got a long time left probably toward the end he was just love everybody but you know what he kept his same message though from when that when that man went went over to the isle of patmos and got that revelation the book of revelation he didn't lose that but you know what though he could only tell us about it because there was a part he couldn't write he saw it he was commissioned to write what he saw not to interpret right what he saw he would begin to write the thunders he saw what they were began to write them down and god said nope hold it right there but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel because remember right there in revelations 10 about five it's when he told john not to write then he comes down on in 10 7 and says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound his message and his message remember was not in the years of preparation his message was from 63 to 65 opening the seals that no one had ever even looked in part of the book you couldn't even look on the book much look in the much less look in the book and he became heavily unpopular at the time he was very popular before then but after that he became very unpopular so i'm wondering why i don't people money women in popularity why'd brother brown tell us to stay away from those three things because they'll get you every time because the devil's in money the devil's in women and the devil's in popularity and the anointing of the good part of that and the bad part of that's about that far apart you think about that ministers we know that but we're living today in bible prophecy amen everybody all right with that and so we know that the four the four dimensions are light time matter fourth dimension is what we're dealing with as far as radio waves i'm just going to go through this real quick the sixth dimension now brother brown said he went to the fifth dimension and he went to the sixth dimension so he saw both sides of the spectrum the fifth dimension we know what that is that's the center dead that's the ones that go there and i believe according to what i can see of of what brother brown was talking about they don't get any kind of good treatment over there they don't get turned back to a 20 year old they stay their same age and they're hurting and i believe they're not doing going through any kind of bliss like brother ray is going through right now i mean why would you strike why would we strive so much why would we according to revelations 8 why would we groan within ourselves listen do you not groan as you get older you groan anyway oh when you get out of the bed and oh when you get up out of chair trying to make a point but as we get older in god we should groan paul said grown to be clothed with that house not made by hands but revelations eight tells that we're we groan within ourself what that inside person is 20 years old and eternal this outside guy it's like i said it's groaning every day but our groaning should our spiritual groaning should be what i'm not in my right condition right i'm not in my right place this is not how could you take even jesus that he even at the garden of gethsemane brother brown said that's where he really fought it out he didn't fight it out at calvary he fought it out in the garden because the garden is where he said let this cup pass for me he could have turned and said no i don't want to do that right but he fought it out in his humanity but knowing he was eternal god listen they wasn't today they might have been things he didn't know but there's one thing he didn't know he was god right he knew who his daddy was he knew who he was and he didn't have a different personality amen he was the same god but that sixth dimension let's go all the way to number four if you don't mind brothers the countdown now the sixth dimension is christ the saints the dead saints are resting saints who is completely work finished on earth and has entered into rest with christ under the altar beautifully there we go okay now the sixth dimension that's where brother ray is that's where brother branham is that's where all the ones that you saw and what did they scream out when because brother branham listen brother branham was i i say confused in his humanity he's never it wasn't confused in his doctrine because he he said i you got to remember when you look at this dream and i thought about this the other day brother branham sometimes had to pinch himself remember him he said i had to pinch myself whether i was in that dimension or this dimension everybody got that some of y'all have to pinch yourself to stay awake in this dimension but he had to pinch himself why because he was in both worlds he was looking at demons flying across the congregation he said you see that red string i mean that black streak going across from that person to the other he said that demon is screaming to that demon over there looking for help because they know their form be it's going to be exposed how many of y'all have ever been yeah you ain't how many of you have ever been in a congregation i don't want to know what you're thinking about me right now but brother brown couldn't know every one of your thoughts he said hey he said i caught that what was he doing he was hearing literally what they were saying in their mind but he gets across and he and he steps and he says i don't know if it was a vision i don't know if it was a dream he said but i look back see i believe in during his life there was never a time that he separated from his body everybody got that there was a when he all the visions he see he was in his body his human body but see this one he he he either had some kind of something happened and he he said i was standing there and he said i turned and looked and there was my body he never had that done before so he didn't know he said i don't know if there's a vision i don't know if it was a dream or what but now he was clear when he figured out what it was going on because when he touched his hair he said oh i got hair oh oh this is the inside of me this is this is what i look like when i ain't in that amen he was in that genesis 126 body that was in that old body but god let him separate why for one purpose not for him now you know he said he said now i wondered about it and i don't worry about it no more see even the prophet of god he thought what the old the old way of thinking hello brother neville hello brother tony you know he said he passed by he said you couldn't shake their hand remember that's what he thought so god showed it to him but you know what god showed it to me and you because see i use that example all the time even in my own self there's a place i'm going to go so what fear does that take that takes it now the little bit of fear of death walking down the valley of the shadow of death but there's a light there knowing that i'm born again doesn't matter if i fall dead the next two seconds i'm gonna be standing with brother ray in them in eternal body waiting to come back here because even they told them they said we don't eat here right that's right they were telling him look we don't eat here we don't drink water here but we're waiting to go back and get our human body oh why can't people read that even in the message i mean if you were just going to get a boom get a new body just boom get it right there but they told brother adam we got to come back and pick up our body because we don't eat your theophany doesn't eat but your body does that's why they're not going to be complete without me and you not going to be complete without us because they're part of their being is still right here part of their natural world is right here and i'll cover that in just a minute i don't want to go through paradise again we've never been through that let's go to perfect love let's go to number six where's this perfect love i'll coordinate i believe i was caught in the sixth dimension looking back down here and could see back the sight isn't exactly with the eyes that's earthly but sight is a greater thing than the sight that you have there their contact is far beyond any contact that our natural senses would contact and remember number seven he talks about being perfect love now look at number eight let's read this one because i want to bring out this point i was thinking about yesterday and i added it in last night or just a few minutes ago the first is perfect love let's go to number seven i mean number eight i'm sorry the first is perfect love that's god's love pure and unadulterated the next comes in there is filial love see the philio love had to develop when adam and eve when adam said she's blowing my bone and flesh and my flesh now listen that was agape love speaking because they had the same theophany right she was in him just separated the feminist part out right so they too were truly one but see that's never going to happen again naturally because of what they did there was another seed injected in there that was not supposed to be there so now you've got the genesis 1 26 man though even though june or myself or brother ray and sister kathy lived 40-something years together they never were a complete one person but brother ray is over in another dimension and he is in his condition of perfection but watch this the first is perfect love that's god's love pure and unadulterated the next comes and there's filial love that's love that you have for your wife and your children but now you have to be careful now bob or louise or somebody or aaron you all need to preach on this okay no there's dif even filial though there's different love past fellow love because i don't have the same filial love i have for june i can't have for my granddaughter that's perverted but it is filial love it is a listen filial love is a temporary love it's not eternal filial love was given to man because you go down to eros and you go to lust and all the different other things and a lot of that has to do with our human being part of us to procreate with everybody got that but filial love is temporary it was given to us in this dimension because here was my here's my point let me write my note you cannot take filial love over there you can't take your filial even though brother i love sister kathy you may prove it brother branham said here comes my first wife hope died when she was about 20 years old right said oh i knew she was just going to come up and say hey husband god bless you he said she hugged my neck and said my precious brother and walked off why he loved her with felio love in this dimension but when she passed into that other dimension feel your love went away that's why brother brown said that jealousy there's no jealousy there's no see there's no jealousy in agape love there's no it's jealousy and filial love and all the other kinds of love but there's none of that but you can't take that only agape love what brother brown said only perfect love will be there but now listen let me bring a point to you there is a time though that brother branham pulls and brings in another vision that he had am i okay with this now remember he's looking at this vision in 1960 his wife's passed away he didn't see his new wife so she was because she wasn't dead yet i've had people preach and said well everybody was there well he didn't say he saw meaty he didn't say he saw bill down he didn't say he saw all the ones that were still alive he saw the ones that had went on from that point back everybody got that amen thank god because you know a lot of people now here we go again a lot of them old people said brother branham said he saw me and he did he says it on the tape he said i saw y'all there or i saw you there he didn't see them he saw the people of his message there at that time because the people there were still sitting there their theophany was right there it wasn't over there in here at the same place amen but sister hope comes across though says my precious brother and walks off now brother branham knows that was his wife because he's still connected back to the filial little body that's laying on the on the bed i hope this will help you something because it helped me but now watch now they are not totally complete without us pay attention just for a minute i'll just quit right here we won't do this no more we'll stop right here there is perfect love but now somewhere when they come back and pick up this body and it's redeemed brother branham has another vision of getting his reward remember he said he feels one grab him on the arm on this side and one grab him on the arm on this side and he said i knew and they knew we had been married in the previous life and we walk up the steps to get my reward with hope and media knowing that they were husband and wife in this time somewhere they picked up something if you'll read who is this melchizedek brother brown tell you there's a spirit part of you that's withholding somewhere because he said the soul will connect with the spirit and then connect with the body see when they're across the curtain of time hope was in her theophany she did not have that natural spirit that had that natural love for william branham or she would have identified him when she was there but when she comes and picks up her body that spirit has got to come back on them because brother brown said you're not going to be husband and wife over there but you know you were husband and wife here well something changed we're going to know it but thank god for this revelation it makes the whole plan so plain and you don't have to worry well because look if you take that that's what i was thinking i love my wife and you love your wife you love your husband you give your life for them and if they're born again that's good but if you take that one situation in 1960 i'd be a little bit disappointed if i went across a curtain of time and there i saw june and she just comes up and says oh my precious brother i walks off i'd be like i mean really think about it but then you see the next the next vision or not the next very next vision but he sees the other vision that clarifies the whole thing because he said we're see he's already they're already in the glorified body they're getting ready to go up and get his reward whatever that reward is but he there's hope he said there's media he said remember he said i always wondered he said hope was a little jealous remember that look it up hope was a little bit jealous i was wondering when she grabbed one arm and hear me because see they knew each other on earth right because as soon as she died he wasn't very long until he married married sister him but all the jealousy was gone but they had picked up a spiritual part of them that could remember what happened on earth see that brought the plan together so now i know that i'll be connected with june for an eternity and see that makes me happy now i don't have to go running after him no more [Applause] same way with you godly man godly wife you're there for an eternity your filial love though has nothing to do with that new birth i read it before brother brown says that you can love with your spirit and not love god you can love god with your spirit and not have your soul be just as black as such so you better be careful now look on the other end of the spectrum there's a lot of people that's going to live their whole life married never born again and that's just going to go away you say that's cruel no it's not cruel they got the same opportunity you do that's not cruel that's god being a judge but think about what god given me and you folks if you give you a godly wife or he gave you a godly husband oh come on amen becca think about it margaret's going to be there might have been a little bit of jealousy but not over there not over there no it'll be a perfect bliss that you'll never even worry about what that so much went on down here because all that you know the bible tells us that the former things will be passed away behold all things have become new now listen you say well now the former things will be done i won't know what i didn't know you're going to know what you did down here cause you're gonna have a testimony just like our sisters you're gonna have testimony your testimony is what's gonna go with you because that 90-year-old woman she still had her testimony even in her theophany she said you're a great leader we were waiting on you to get here right we're going to go back and get our bodies and then we're going to come back god's uh jesus is going to come and get you she was preaching to the prophet this 90 year old woman but she was in her theophany amen the genesis 1 26 was and is perfect love and it was situated in god's mind before the foundation of the world a piece of god that no one else can get to satan can't find it satan can't be a part of it nobody can be a part of it but his bride the ones that he saw that he saw that took it and lived it let me read quote number 14 you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the endless and you can love and even love god and still not be right listen that's why that's why you have to realize what brother brown was talking about he said he said you can have the baptism of the holy ghost watch his terminology on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell but you can't have the new birth and die and go to hell they're so close but they're so far apart right because you can be at what what's anointed ones they're anointed by the true genuine holy ghost but they've never had an intimate they've never had a agape love with god almighty they've just took what the filial love is and made it tried to make it agape love brother brown said in quote number 15 he said real genuine love will create a confidence in his word right you don't put your listen i don't put my confidence in that june loves me and that's going to put me in heaven my confidence is that god loves me that god loved me and i'm loving him back and that's what's going to put me into heaven amen real genuine love will create a confidence in his word let me read this we won't get to the chart sister julie hang on to that chart thank you she's gotten him because we'll get to it next time is that all right well i want to read these quotes and we'll be done position of a believer in 1955 listen to this under the law under the shadows they entered in under the shedding of the blood of goats and bolts which we went through which could not take away sin it was the life of an animal how could the life and spirit of a dead animal coming out of the blood of life the cell of life breaking forth the blood that was shed ever that life ever returned back into an animal in other words it can't come into you it can't even go back into another animal but watch this this is the part that i'd read and it just really makes you think what god did for us listen to this or to a man the life of a lamb of a heifer of a goat or an animal that's been sacrificed after the blood has been broken for our sins that's why it never returns back and having anything to do with a human being it could not watch this but god before the foundation of the world foreordained that jesus would come the perfect lamb of god into a perfect cell that god created himself or god create god himself created look to bring blood into the world to bring blood into the world human blood but the blood of almighty god to bring blood into the world to offer that blood yes amen amen and if you turn that down in this hour i love that to that center that was in that blood cell with his love that was the love of god is that he made himself a human being he made himself a blood cell that not only he could die for you but he could come back and get inside of you with that love and the holy ghost himself after that offering of that man can come back and possess a believer he bought eternal redemption now did you get that now see through the blood washing of the blood taking away separating of sin that the holy spirit lose the believer through the blood cleansing of the soul into fellowship into this spirit life inside with christ shut out with the world and look very nature of god is in you still subject to mistakes but god can't see it how many of you is carrying mistakes today why come on i'll ask you one more time why why because it's covered by the blood god can't see it god can't see through the blood every time he looks through the blood it looks white he looks through the blood it looks white so if god was so pleased with christ till he accepted him and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and through christ being the perfect one us dead to our own thoughts and ideas being born of the spirit of god walking not after theology or hope or maybe so but after the spirit inside of us then let the dead in christ walk not after the things of the world i've been telling y'all for years the dead in christ is not the brother ray over there you died here right amen after the spirit said let the dead in christ walk not after the things of the world but after the things of the spirit romans 8 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus look though that walk not after the flesh fighting war strife envying selfish things but after the spirit a couple more listen to this hebrew series 1957 neither by the blood of goats calves but by his own blood he entered him once into the holy place this is where we've been reading having obtained eternal redemption do you get it eternal redemption for us not to be redeemed today and then next week when the revival starts be redeemed again and then oh we backslide and be redeemed again you're redeemed once forever that's right no more redeemed redeemed redeemed eternal redemption he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall never come to the judgment but hath past tense past from death and to life because he was shook because he was baptized a certain way because he had blood in his hand because he has believed on scroll up please well because he has believed on the only begotten son of god look that's how we have eternal redemption listen to this fellowship 1960. talk about a super sign he could have come an angel if he wanted to he kind of could have come a full mature man but a baby over a pile of manure crying talk about a super sign that's real super sign a baby jehovah crying as a baby a super sign oh my then people saying he's just a prophet oh my the super sign jehovah is a boy playing jehovah a man twirling in carpenter shop jehovah himself made flesh and dwelt among us stretched his tent down here made himself a body to live in to have a blood cell to have a human blood cell but inside of that blood cell was not just normal human life that was eternal life to have a blood cell that that blood cell could be broken hallelujah that was the lamb of god that was slain from the foundation of the world that brings us eternal redemption the bible said so it brought us eternal redemption we are purchased by the precious blood of jesus christ which has given us eternal life how do you do it i don't know i believe he did but you know what i mean let's stand our feet musicians come and that's what we're going to get to on a chart where jesus comes on earth as a human being he had to come as a human mortal man he had to come with a with a with humanity he had to be part of us he had to be our brother but now remember he wasn't sinful he took on mine in your sin you say brother wait that's elementary have you ever really looked at that quote though that i just read you he had to create a blood cell and it had to have eternal life in it to begin with amen listen jesus christ didn't develop eternal life as he got older jesus christ didn't need a new birth he told nicodemus he said nicodemus you born different than me you need a new birth you need to be born again nicodemus says i got to go back and get in my mama's womb and no it just went right over his head but you and i we know what we got to do if you're not part of that perfect love then you do have a fearful time because perfect love casts out fear let's sing a song 319 let's worship god [Music] is [Music] that gives me strength from day to day [Music] is [Music] valley [Music] it will never lose [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's going to carry us from here all the way into glory doesn't matter where you go you can't be once you get covered by the blood you can't get uncovered there's no way there's no way you can get uncovered you're covered by what agape love we still have to live in filial love you know that you know that and i know that but the love of god's got to take over sometime because it'll never lose its power and he created a blood cell and came down here on earth to die for me and you that's elementary but if we ever lose that in the beginning of our christianity don't you ever lose that what jesus christ did for you don't ever forget that we sure we've got the greatest message since since jesus christ walked on the face of the earth right greatest message but we still got to remember jesus christ is the message jesus christ died on a cross so that you and i could see this plan and see it made manifest in a group of people amen amen let's hang on the map [Music] you know i was looking the other day and i'm talking to everybody here i hope everybody can hear me downstairs but sometimes you know dale's asked y'all many many times about how many times it your kids go to the bathroom and how many disrupt services and terrence has said the same thing well from this day forward we're going to try something different i read a quote right here for brother brown was talking about that woman that fixed herself up she got ready to prophesy and he saw her getting ready let me read you he said she jumped up i said sit down she started on i said sit down and boy everybody i just stopped she acted like she didn't hear me she said i squealed it out sit down she heard it that time so if your parents can't take care of your kids if they go out of this sanctuary over one time from now on and i'm preaching i'm gonna make them sit down you got it if you're mad with that then you talk to god about it because i can keep reading on down here where brother brown says you grieve the holy spirit right right by not doing what god said now listen an older person but i tell you what i had i had a little trouble with my kidneys and i but i would drink coffee before second service i quit drinking coffee for a second service and i don't have to go to the bathroom i quit drinking coffee in church before first service so i'd make sure that my bladder's empty you say well boy you're being no i'm not you've been told you've been told and told and told well they can do what they want to do but when i'm preaching up here in second service if your kid gets up over one time and goes to the bathroom you're going to hear me say the same thing right here if you get mad at it the prophet said you grieve the holy spirit he didn't grieve it by screaming at him you grieved it by not doing what god said now older people i can understand if we our bladder gets a little weak when we get older but now young kids no i ain't having it i there is no excuse right not one right you go to the bathroom one time you better not go again in my service i will sit you down you everybody got that okay that's why i want to do it at the end of the service god bless now listen listen i we are human beings but this thing's getting serious brother branham says right here let me read this one thing right here says sister but you was given the wrong message sister watch this right here he said there's one thing wrong with you either you were in the flesh or you've got a wrong pastor that trains you that don't know nothing about scripture listen to this she done it three nights in a row he said that's wrong you're out of order you lost many souls night before last and many last night again and you've done it the same thing tonight she was responsible now she got up she spoke in tongues brother brown said that could have been of the holy spirit he said but she was out of order she's out order you lost many souls not before last and many souls last night again and you've done it the same thing tonight brother braddon i beg your pardon the preacher says i said what do you mean he said she had a right to give that message he said i was on the platform and the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophets i'm still in the platform i have the message so that's what's going to happen from now on if you can't set them down i will that's right anybody good with that man that's the way it's gonna happen from now on to me anyway if brother brown can say sit down and and uh be in line then i believe i'll be able to do the same thing everybody understand that am i clear [Applause] if you're sick that's a different story but two or three times in the service you need to come up here yeah instead of going back under you need to come up here we'll pray for you and then you go do what you need to do but you can't be getting up in and out of service all the time and it used to not bother me but it bothers me now i lose my train of thought i'm getting older i was brother dale he just plowed right on i guess but i can't do that but and you know what if you grieve the holy spirit then it's your problem it's not mine okay i love you with love lord i love you with a gothic love you may be hating me with filial level right now but like brother dale said look we're not preaching to your to your spirit we're preaching to your soul we want your soul to be right if your soul's not right then let's get it right i want us to move on what if brother branham said one child running through the building before the next service can disrupt the whole he didn't say a little bit he said disrupt the whole second service why the holy spirit's in here you say no no we're out the door the holy spirit's here the devil's here too so why can't the holy spirit be here this is his house amen let's buy our heads the only father thank you for this day you give us lord we're just trying to prepare ourselves for this last push i believe that we're right on the brink of something so wonderfully supernatural that the world is going to have to bend and break from the power that is given out by the bride of jesus christ if we're groaning lord that means the world is groaning we see tornadoes and tsunamis and earthquakes and several volcanoes they said is just right now on the brink of exploding there in mexico and wipe out 10 million people if they both blow up at one time lord this whole world is screaming for the bride to come to perfection they're screaming for the manifestation of the sons of god where a man can walk out on his porch and say peace be still and the storm go away or as the prophet did with the bull and different animals lord we saw for a moment but brother branham told us lord he said what you see in part you're gonna see in its fullness it'll be like popcorn popping fireworks going off in the church but we can't do that with little sin and little things in our life that we can't get right but lord you can make it right for us if we'll just do as brother trevor said just get on our knees sometime humble ourself before you lord not just lay in the bed or sit in a chair and pray like we always do and i do the same thing at night in the bed but let's hit our knees every once in a while let's raise our hands as as the eagles that we are we need to raise those two wings up and say papa come take us home if we're too satisfied with this world lord we don't have you inside of us but lord by the power of the holy ghost we're going to leave this world and we're going to get out of here and we're going to go we're going to see brother ray again we're going to see brother eugene we're going to see brother dick brother rich marlow but gary atkins all the different ones lord that we've personally been involved with lord we're going to see him in the beauty of perfection agape love coming back to this earth again but lord we got to be full of it now and i pray that you should be with us on the highways be with us lord as we travel give us all travel and mercies and be with us as we go to our jobs tomorrow morning and be back together wednesday night brother and bring the message to us lord we pray that you just sanctify us all we love each person you know in our heart with the love of the lord and we pray that you'll just be with us now heal the sick bear brother danny lord touch his body his body's been through a lot the past 10 or 15 years we know it's a little bit weak but father that doesn't mean anything to you that means that more of a miracle when our brother comes out of this that you'll take that broken up body of his lord and you'll restore it back to life again father we pray to be with the ones too that are not with us lead us and guide us by your holy spirit until we meet again father in jesus name we ask these things amen you're dismissed god bless you give thee spread your wings little eagles so spread your wings [Music] lily
