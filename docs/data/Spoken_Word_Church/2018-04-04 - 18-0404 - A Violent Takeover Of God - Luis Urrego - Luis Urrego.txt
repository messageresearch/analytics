========================================

I want to see you [Music] or out your power in love as we say holy I [Music] shiny [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oly Oly hopefully Oh [Music] want to see raise the Lord Jesus hope that's your desired this evening this afternoon and to see him they met I don't want to see a man I want to see God in the man a man and just to have a blessing to know and to see that God can use feeble lips like ours amen to speak to our hearts amen why don't I some God that he is amen he used a donkey and in the in the Bible and so he can use whatever he wants to but he decided that he was gonna use man a man to speak his word amen and not just a preacher but you sisters you're also preachers in your home amen you young people Amen you're also preachers wherever you're at you don't need to necessarily speak to the people but just by living your life that speaks volumes amen it's more than what your words can say amen praise God so I trust that each and every one of you are doing well this afternoon and could just pray for those that are traveling and I think brother Joe Canada them there they're on their way back so you remember them in prayer and also brother Richard and then probably are still out so just remember them brother Dale and and sister Peggy and he told me that they would be tuning in so so yeah but you know what brother Dale he he deserves he deserves a little break you know and so and so does she amen and you know I have no no ought about it you know you know they need that time yes play so so I'm gonna we're just gonna go ahead and read the scripture now I'm gonna mention something else and then we'll get started let's read up in Matthew chapter 11 Matthew chapter 11 and start at verse 11 Matthew 11 verse 11 say man if you have it amen Bible says verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen of greater than John the Baptist this is Jesus speaking now what standing he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and we know the reason why he said that was because John the Baptist he didn't have he didn't have the new birth yet he was introducing the Messiah and so we're greater than John the Baptist because we can experience the new birth in our life amen amen verse 12 and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force that's key for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John and if you will receive it this is Elias which was forth to come he that hath ears now every time Jesus says something like this it's very important he that hath ears to hear let him hear Amen now if we want to turn to to Luke chapter 16 and starting at verse 14 this is the same scripture the way it Luke's account but it's worded a little bit differently start at verse 14 and it says and the Pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him the right of Jesus and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but God knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among Jews men is abomination in the sight of God so in other words what they esteemed was great and was uh you know holy and him you know just the right righteous way it was a stink in the God's nostrils the law verse 16 the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it amen and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail I like that Amen you this word ain't gonna fail Amen everything else will take place but this word will will fulfill be fulfilled amen so let's just go to the Lord in prayer this afternoon our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity to gather here together with believers Lord our brothers and sisters Lord Jesus of like precious faith thank you Father God for this time that you've given us to open back the pages of your word we would ask you Lord before anything father that you would forgive us if there's any sin in our heart any any iniquity father God that we may that may hinder the service Lord God we just place it under the blood of Jesus Christ right now and pray father God that you'd help us to have open minds and open ears to receive father God what you'd want to say to us Lord let me father God get aside so that you can speak through my my lips Lord and father God stopped me from saying anything that I should not say that would not be edifying Lord father God and that you your people father would be edified Lord and you will be glorified through what is being said and done this evening be with the ones that are still traveling Lord watch over their keep them Lord keep brother Dale Lord God and sister Peggy and just help them to have a relaxing time and

just bless her be with her protect her father God and Lord just continue to work father God in her dad father God and the situation there our Lord Jesus we love you we commit ourselves into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord Saints you may be seated amen so you you all just remember my wife Christine in prayer her dad's not no he's he's not getting any better from the brain cancer that he's had he's had last week he had two episodes of seizures and so there's they're thinking about putting him back on on steroids and and so he's lost a lot of weight and everything so my wife's gonna go and assess the situation and but you know things are looking a little bit grim so you remember her in prayer remember the family in prayer cuz we just went through this cycle about a year and a half ago and then the same things happening again so just remember us and your prayers that Lord would just help us during this time amen praise God I'll be a married bachelor for a week again but it will be alright Spring Break Spring Break girls are out of school I don't have to pack lunches and do all kind of stuff amen so just remember us in prayer amen Lord willing she'll be back next Thursday amen also I want to say happy birthday to my brother Bob 43 years old 43 right yeah that's right yeah he said that with yeah that's right but god bless him and appreciate brother Bob in there I've I've come before before I started coming to the church here more than continually I just kind of knew brother Bob by just kind of shaking his hand but as the years have gone and kind of gotten to know him a little bit more I really realized you know he's he really loves the Lord amen and I just appreciate his friendship appreciate appreciate everything that he stands for amen and just you know we have a lot in common so but just god bless him I think for granting him another year amen praise Lord so tonight I would just want to speak about local give this if I could give this a little Tyler a violent takeover of God a violent takeover of God you know Saints and when Jesus was speaking here about how the how the kingdom suffereth violence and the violent take it by force because at that time when John the Baptist was was preaching he came by he came forth saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand amen and it was it was at that time when those words started to be sound and forth cuz you didn't really see anything about the kingdom of God or the kingdom of heaven in the Old Testament it was when John the Baptist came on the scene and he was telling the people repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand then Jesus Christ comes and starts preaching the kingdom of God and bringing the kingdom of God and laying the kingdom of God and relaying the kingdom of heaven down to the people and that was part of what they repenting was part of what the kingdom of God was all about because remember when Jesus said to when he met with Nicodemus and he told them that you must be born again it was a my supposed to go back into my mom's womb I'm a mother and he didn't know what he didn't and he was a man that had studied the law and studied the the the scriptures and yet did not understand the kingdom of God how I wonder if that's how our we are you could be in the message for 15 20 30 years and still don't know what this message is all about still don't understand what this kingdom is all about because all it is this is intellectual knowledge to you amen so here's and so Jesus comes in on the scene he says in the kingdom of heaven started being preached since John and then the violent which were the people at that time coming in droves wanting to get a repent wanted to get baptized beyond the John John's ministry and then when Jesus comes on the scene they want to hear what Jesus has to say now that not everybody did but there was a lot of people at that time because this was something new something never had seen before and so they wanted to and so that's why the scripture it's interesting how Jesus words it that that the now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force and Jesus I mean Jesus wasn't opposed about the kingdom being taken he wanted the kingdom to be taken that's the reason why he said in the violent take it by force so that's the so that tells me that that is the only way that the kingdom of God is to be possessed they men it's by force now we're gonna get more about it we're gonna get more into that because let me tell you since we are living in a lakhs hour in this hour we are living in an hour where we think oh everything's fine and dandy and we are okay we just sit back and listen to a sermon and and brother Dale the brother way brother Louie's brother Bob whoever preaches just preaches 45 minutes and and we're just going to go home and turn on TV and do whatever not think one time of what was said behind this pulpit let me tell you one day will be the last time you hear a message behind this pulpit and the next thing you know you'll be facing God and what are you going to do then I'm speaking to both the the the the pulpit all the way to the janitor's room young people and everybody because I'm part of it we get Sol axed in this hour and we think that that well cos brother Dale's preaching the word and then and then the ministry here is preaching the word and we don't do anything about it ourselves is that taking the kingdom by force now that's taking the kingdom by nonchalant actually you're not taking the king by you want you want the kingdom you got to take it by force Amen praise God so if I say something tonight that might hurt some feelings will thank goodness thank God because I will doesn't matter I don't care you can this will be the last time I preach if I have to preach and brother Dale you know I'm sure he'll be he don't mind cuz Saint let me tell you it's time that you know Saints brother brother Wade preached of a few a few years ago on Daniel seventy weeks and the way things are panning out right now in the world it could very well be that next year we've LIGO in a rapture now I'm not saying that does set the Lord and brother the way wasn't saying that either at that time but just the way things are panning out for us to just sitting around not you know not caring about and just taking everything like a routine I'm tired of the routine sense I want to see God working them on our miss we have people that are sick we have people that need heat salvation we have young people that need the Holy Ghost and that and that was the same thing that has taped for several years and where's the young people that were here just a few years ago where are they out there now serving the Lord they should be here at church what are they doing why and it like brother Graham said it's not true child delinquencies parent delinquency because as parents they see our laxa dacing spirit and the falling asleep at church III get in that same way too then that our children just follow just right after they are children normally just want to follow the easy route and if you as parents show them the easier route and you get home and you don't study you don't pray you don't act upon the Word of God or what was said behind the pulpit your children are going the same way amen so the Bible says here in in in in Luke 16 it says since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it now that's the question we need to ask ourselves we've been in this message we've heard this message now for 30 40 50 years some of us had word in we're still living when the Prophet was still with us and have we possessed the kingdom pressed into that kingdom the way we should know will I know too much now about the message I know too much I've got revelation my dad's the preacher and my mom you know she's been in the mitt I don't need none of that like I said you might be hearing your last sermon amen praise God now the Bible now the the word violence in the in the Webster's dictionary it says this is the meaning it says the use of physical force so as to injure abuse damage or destroy now that's not of course that's not what Jesus was was speaking about here but then the other the other one is intense turbulent or furious and often destructive action or force the violence of the storm now we've had violent storms we've seen how what damage that could cause but look what I like what this says it says vehement feeling or expression a fervor also an instance of such action or feeling it's a vehement amen so then I looked up what the word vehement meant I know what what it is but I mean I just wanted to read that to you it's means intensely emotional impassioned fervid vehement patriotism you know we're so we're very patriotic about the America and about the flag and that's good that's now because you know when the World Cup comes around and I'm happy that my teams in the World Cup you know I'm happy to see that you know and you know how I like soccer and so forth but that's fine to be petty patriotic and there's no problem with that man but sometimes we get we get so caught up with more of that the natural things in life and that same energy that we give other things if we would give it to the kingdom of God amen oh my we would be so much better off amen the same energy that you take a man to to to express yourself in on social media or whatever that energy if you can just take it amen to to to look more into the Word of God to get down for five minutes and pray instead of taking five minutes to post something on social media and nobody cares afterwards but I don't really care what you ate yesterday I don't really care what where you wear your what restaurant you're eating at I don't care I do care if you you know if you post the Word of God on there something that has to do with the Word of God oh yeah I'll read that but I don't care about anything else I because it doesn't interest the child of God you know Saints I've come to a point now that I realize that the time this time is winding down and the pity paddling and they just did he darling with the with the things of God here and there and and not really taking it so sincere and and those days are long gone I've come to the point you know now that that it's it's it's obtained God or perish you know there's no time for us to sit back and relax it's time for us to meditate on the things that are being said in this hour getting the word amen and get that word in you that's how you possess the kingdom amen any other way you're just wasting your time you know we had our you know the last angel left the scene Billy Graham left the scene things are shaping into place you know and so are we shaping into place that's the question we need to ask ourselves amen so this vehement intense emotional passionate burbot deeply felt and forcibly expressed do we forcibly do we feel that way about God in this hour oh we might have felt about God that way maybe 10 15 20 years ago 30 years ago when you first come to the Lord do you remember when you first come to the Jesus Christ oh my you word you were so passionate about the word yeah there was nothing that would videogames forget it throw them out the window but then all of a sudden the video games are coming back in the in the house the movies are coming back in the house the things are coming back in the house that you thought oh my I'll never those things are back in your play taking the place of God in your life you don't have a God in your life we don't know we don't we don't have we don't have idols in our in our in our in our houses you know and and things like that let me tell you the things that you like to do that take place before prayer and studying that's an idol that's an idol before and God is a jealous God God is a jealous God because God God wants to bless you more than you think that he wants to that he wanted that he would want to bless you but as I said before if you only just give him your arm that's all he's gonna use you give him your finger that's all he'll use I like the example that brother Wade gave the other day about the beehives you know well did you know he what the person wants to know more about about about the beehives and about what it is to raise bees and honey and all that well he's going to just get more beehives and more beehives to learn more to learn more but if you're just fine just coming to church and singing for 30 minutes and and listening to a message for 45 minutes and then out the door and that's it then that's all you get out of God I want more out of God than just that amen but now you might say well that's brother Lewis just just preaching and you know just saying you know whatever how do you know it's not God talking to you I thought that that's what the fawful Ministry supposed to be God speaking through our hearts oh that's just brother Louise you know he's up there jibber jabbering that's what I would say about Jesus Christ you know what I'm saying I say these things because this is what I'm express feeling on my own you know I want to draw closer to God you know when brother Dale asks the question the other day how many of you have even picked up a seals book you know and just by just by the reaction of how the you know that you could it said a lot of words you know now I'm not gonna say that I'm not I've told this to brother Bob I'm not the best reader in the reading is always a weakness of mine but I love listening though I can listen and I can listen and read so I may not have been I may not have read the seal book but I've heard it but but but I want more I just don't want to release I'll read it once and then listen to it once and that's it there's more in there amen there's more in there you know you just don't read the Bible once so I finished reading the Bible and that's it no amens God's Word is eternal that means there's no ending to this revelation to you there's there's gems in there that only you're gonna be able to find if you seek that's what Jesus said seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you but if you don't seek then you're not gonna find and if you only seek a little bit you'll only find a little bit but if you find if you seek a lot you'll find a lot what a concept the law of God amen amen praise God now so why does the sinner take the kingdom by force well for one they feel the sinner feels that they have no natural right to it you see that's the reason why the sinner back then when they would hear Jesus and John the Baptist he meant they would flock amen and they would take the kingdom of God by violence for one because they didn't feel that they had any right to it you know do you feel that way you know and do you feel that the oh well imma just entitled to it all you're not entitled to anything God wants you to do your part too as well there's a part that you must play you know the children of Israel they had God had given them the promise already that they were going to take the land that God was God had already given them the land but they had to go in and possess it themselves as I said Sunday when I was when I was talking about the kingdom of God and if I encourage you all to listen to that series you know five-part series that we did and and and God wasn't just gonna take them here you are all right on a flowery bed of ease that's the kind of Christian life we all want but God doesn't work that way God does not work that way God God God's given us the promise the promise is in his word it's already there the promise is here this is the message right but can you take this amen and apply to your life so that you can overcome the devil in your life so that you can overcome whatever it is that you're struggling with let me tell you what there's an overcoming that you and I must do Saints in this hour I heard something the other day I thought it was I thought it was good it was simple but very profound and that is that don't play with the demons that you want to overcome the demons that are there that you say you want to overcome whatever it is that you want to come lying lust or whatever it is but if you play with those demons you're never gonna overcome them amen if you just pity patter with the demons and those days you're never gonna overcome them they're always gonna have overcoming power over you it's like yes kill them amen so and of course you know the message of the Cross at that time of course Jesus had not died yet but today you know you may still see people maybe accepting the Lord Jesus Christ and and how did you come in amen that the message of the Cross that what does it do to you does it do to you when you think about about about what Christ did for you does it do the same thing it did for you 20 years ago don't you think about that Saints that's the word that's the word but some of us well I got the message now I don't need all that stuff anymore we're all the way up here now you know in the in the in the headstone and yes and all that's it all but let me tell you what you know brother wait brother wait he likes he likes meat he talked about meat and and steak and things like that and that's fine you know I say this I say this and we'll read the scripture together we should be at the point where rate eating meat now right spiritually speaking we're eating me and the Bible even says Paul update I believe says that you should be even teachers right now not necessarily preaching but can you explain the things around this message can you explain the Word of God can you tell somebody about about what happened in the garden without quoting just with the word can you do it I bet you must leave us we can't do it that's the reason why we avoid talking about anything Christian with people because we agree that we don't know what to say we don't know about the Bible we just come to church so but I say this this I say this you should be already eating skillful eating meat spiritual meat but at the same time we not we don't forget about the milk as well the milk is the foundation and you know like I told one church the other day I said you know I still like to drink milk but that's not what I completely feed off of right milk has this has has some vitamins has some things that you need is well in there and but I also need heavier food as well with a glass of milk not forgetting the foundations of Christ not forgetting repenting not forgetting baptism the name Lord Jesus Christ not forgetting the message of the Cross not forgetting these things that we so easily forget just because we're in the message did God want you to forget about these things no you might say oh he's just bringing denominational stuff you can say whatever you want to say but is we need to repent we need to get we need to get back soul-searching and get back in and even it fill these the this this this uh up here with with people repenting if you need to if you really want to take the kingdom by violence by force because God ain't gonna make you God's not gonna make you now complacency is the 21st century Christian battle we are so complacent in this our complacency everywhere well especially in Christians and then I come into the message you know I came into the message in in in nineteen ninety nine and I saw even more complacency and they were believing that the God sent a prophet and yet they were more complacent that's probably the reason why oh we have it all we have it off we're just kind of sitting around waiting for the train to come and pick us up and we take it you're gonna fall asleep that way I always I've always said this Saints I've always said you put that car on cruise control you're gonna end up falling asleep a car driving on itself oh it'll drive yeah but you'll end up falling asleep and then fall off on the side of the ditch so road somewhere and that'll be the end of you and and and don't think that they're putting this thing on cruise control and then one day I'm just gonna just go to church and sing some songs and do what it would you know just be there so that you know people can see that I'm there and then you know go home and do my thing and then one day you know it all just kind of gets straightened up with God you know he knows my heart and he knows what my that's not that's not the attitude to take you know saying that the attitude of a Christian a man is that they want more of God amen they want desire they desire more of God it's a zeal that is in them a feeling a man that they that they're not complacent I imagine the other day when brother long you know preached where he was preaching I was thoroughly enjoying what he was saying next thing you know it was it was time he was dismissing I'm like what no I wanted more I'm like brother Chris why in the world you can ask the brothers in the back I'm like I can't believe this he finished early I wanted more but you know what several years ago that wasn't the desire I had in my heart I was glad when they were finishing up church oh my I couldn't wait for church service to go up cuz I had things I need to do at my house video games to play and and thing bad things to do there wasn't anything good now our desire the word you know a Christian truly desires to be in the house of God it's not not just satisfied with 30 minutes 45 minutes so I did my religion thanks that's not that's not that's not a that's not taking the kingdom by force and so in Revelation to the Church of Ephesus left their first love we see that and of course Jesus tells them in that same chapter the two repent to get back into their first love amen so even even at the first church age they were already complacency was already creeping in how much more in this age my goodness where everybody's complacent and everybody thinks that Christianity is just so easy and so it has to be so easy and so nonchalant and and you think about the people who suffered before us and and and and and the things that they went through a man just to be able to to read the word I heard a testimony about a Chinese brother a Chinese man who who was he might have heard the testimony he was in prison he was put in prison for his faith he was there they were he was in a small little jail cell and they were beating him and doing all kinds of things to him and putting needles in between his fingernails and inside his fingernails and all kinds of stuff but the whole time he's he's he's already been delivered now he's been but he's tested he's testified of this the whole time he said I was just praying that God would send somebody to bring me a Bible and when he was praying that with blood are you spurting out of his his face and his fingernails and all kinds of stuff the next day one of the jail guards throws him a Bible inside of the inside of the inside of the cell one of the ones that was mistreating him for some reason he said that he just threw us a Bible in there and he said Lord I just let me know I might I wasn't asking you see God is in line God was probably trying to teach him something you know but God was in line he was in line with what God really wanted for him amen he could have said was Lord I want to be get I wouldn't be get out of this place can you just get me out know why he was praying was lord give me a Bible and God granted that for him but after that then God granted his freedom seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you saying all these other things money all these other things will be added to you know it doesn't mean we're gonna be rich or anything like that but but but you know all the needs will be met he promised it in his word but if we put other things before God don't expect for God to meet your needs or to meet to give you the desires of your heart I hope somebody's taking this in amen now brother I understand if you could bring up the this this chart here that's the picture I hope I hope he's able to bring it so the Laodicean church we know that it was lukewarm and dying spiritually and we read that there in in in in in in Revelation chapter 3 now brother brother Joe Canada he sent me this picture several years ago and I thought it was so good how to know this is Uma back out brother Anderson how to know that you are dying spiritually when one is that you have left your first love so the message of the cross you know isn't isn't doesn't do anything for you anymore I just go to church and that's it the church services bore you you can see that when with the way some people sit around and sit at church you know sleeping the whole time yeah I have you kind of dozing off with you know hearing that's understand and of course the older older generation I understand you know there's you know but when you when you're young and you're dozing off sleeping and I'm talking about sleeping yeah something's wrong with that something's wrong with you so the church services bore you that means the Word of God is boring to you you have no interest in saving souls you have no interest about the people out there that you come in contact with every day Lord look you know not till I tell my daughter's this and I tell Bella this because she's in public schooling and she say to encounter certain things and things you know certain with with other girls and I tell her I said look you don't have to impose your way of living to them you don't even have to say anything to them just live a certain life they'll be they'll make them thirsty and they'll ask when they ask that's your opportunity and of course you don't want to impose they're young and they have other things they need to be thinking about but do you say before you leave the house every morning lord give me an opportunity to bring the soul to the kingdom of heaven to speak or to drop a seed but because you don't study the Word of God or you don't read or you or you don't take in the things that you heard the night the on Wednesday night or Sunday you'd the hope hopefully you don't have to talk to anybody about about say about the word of God because you don't understand the Word of God I'm just gonna be wrong with you all because better to be it that way worldly things attract you more than spiritual things and you know that young people they have a tough time with this you know we're not just young people I was adults too and you're you are fooling yourself thinking that everything's fine and dandy you're just fooling yourself that you think you'll come to the end and you face the Lord and you say Lord I have nothing to say what can you I went to church every day III did some work in the church I did but that's all yeah by failing to do what you know you need to do I hope I'm challenging that's under me all this morning or this this evening frequent absences at the worship services you know I I I'm told my wife this and and and I've expressed this to them but if if it wasn't for for me having a family and having the girls and helping my wife back there I'd be right up here like I want to get the blessings as fresh as possible I'd be right up here but that's one of the signs that somebody's backsliding because they're backsliding for they're going all the way to the back next thing you know they're all the way back in the back door and you don't see them anymore they'll start off all happy and enthused up here and a member of the Delta Lord next thing you know they're just two three four five six and all the way in the back and then you just see them out the door and of course no participation in the work of the church I'll just kind of sit in the corner and just kind of let people you know members when I preach the message about a bib and apron you know a true Christian puts on an apron and serves others the ones that don't really care about you know they have dibs on and just well just feed me whatever you know and they get kind of sloppy and get kind of but I say Saints wait from your sleep because the church needs you your justin is an important vessel as the minister is as the deacon is as the song leader is you are needed amen so brilliance and just bring up the scripture revelation my goodness I thought I wasn't gonna have anything to say let's go through these scriptures here it's because Saints again this is not just me saying this the scriptures that we're about to read say the sack same thing now here's revelations chapter 3 verse 15 well you know these scriptures we've read them but let's read them all right I know that works this is Jesus speaking to the Church of later see I know that works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would our thou wert cold or hot not lukewarm Wow you either in or out but not in between amen so then because thou art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth Jesus himself in other words he's gonna vomit you out of his mouth you have no part in him because they'll say as I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and and I said I said downstairs I said in this age this definitely this this can really apply to this age and Jesus was right because with the with the with the invention of the internet anybody can make money now you know you don't have to be at a 8 to 9 9 to 5 job anymore you can live off passive income from the internet if you if you work hard enough to do it you know and there's many people out there doing it now living on beaches and letting money work for them and not them work for money it's a mentality it's a mentality now that the previous generations don't don't don't understand but that's how it is nowadays so a lot of people make me money there's a there's a lot more millionaires now than there was 20 years ago because of the internet so because they'll say is I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked that's how Jesus saw them they saw themselves rich and increased with Goods Jesus all naked blind and poor amen counts verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayst be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the same shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten it is this is speaking to Laodicea so if you feel like this as well as this brother lui speaking and I'll just go home and you know just do my own thing then that means you didn't get rebuked or chase tonight as to you it's just another service as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent this is not the disciples saying this this is Jesus saying this amen so you know but st. Simon we are so satisfied with routines we're so satisfied with with with it's got to be this way and if it kind of falters out a little bit from that way then we just you know if somebody gets up and shouting and dancing in the spirit everybody oh we don't do that here like it's a Baptist Church or something like that Saints that's that's that's that's part of taking the kingdom Saints I believe we have gifts in this church I believe it where are they not being exorcised why then you know how that brother brand preached that message why God God ghasts you why I've given you the promises I've given you everything that you have need of I've given you everything the message fivefold ministry of teaching ministry I've given you everything yet you just rather sit there and listen to and just be sleepy young people you know if you have a you know your dad that preaches or whatever it doesn't matter your dad preaches you're not going behind your dad's coattail you're not going to heaven because your dad's a minister or he's a deacon or your mom serves the Lord or no you're going because you have an experience with God yourself you know him and you ain't and you want more of him it's a desire that God has to put in you otherwise you're just manufacturing things if it's not true desire for you to want more of God to pray to seek Him to to be in the house of God to serve the brethren and do these things amen that that caused you to grow more in Christ amen then you're just putting peacock feathers on your Buzzard carcass you just look like a Christian and but you're not you may pray like a Christian but you're not you may sound like a Christian but you don't you're not a Christian I hope I'm challenging you I hope so because things we don't well you know I love the teaching ministry and I understand you know we when teaching goes forth we have to pay attention and it's best to pay attention you know but sometimes we need something like this every now and then man I know I do amen I gotta get shaking up say we knowing that you know there's sleepiness that we get in all the time you know and all these things my goodness it's when I do it because I do it because I get in that condition and then I and then and then brother Dale gives me the opportunity to preach well then I'll just preach what's on my heart amen so the question Saints are you closer to God than you were a year ago are you closer to God than you were five years ago ten years ago when you first heard the message when you first heard that brother Branham was a prophet are you closer to God didn't then and and you know if we get so violent about we get so violent about things other things you know Church programs you know the church program has to be dust and dust and dust we got to do it like this and and you know and about your Christmas trees and all these things Christmas and all that you you get so so violent about those things and then when it comes time for the Word of God there's no violence in that how you're seen violence it's radical if you've watched violent movie or something like that you know it's not anything it's something that's that's moving you know it's something that's violent you know now that's we're not talking about physical bloodshed and violence but what we're talking about is taking God taking God Lord I won't let you go until you bless me amen that's what Jacob did Jacob did the exam and that was in the Old Testament that was it before Jesus Christ died on the cross under the the blood of bulls and goats and he said Lord I'm not going to let you go until you bless me and the thing that I like about that scripture is that the in the end that Scripture it says that he got a loan after he let his family go and then kind of domed the cross you know he said alone that's what we need to do say every now and then just be alone just you and God and when you're when you're meditating on God God comes on the scene and then you wrestled with God and you say Lord bless me or else I'll perish and that's what happened to Jacob he was so blessed that does the angel hit him on the side and and his walk was different after that he was never the same after that neither was his name everything changed about him but we're just so custom to just give a doing a little five-minute prayers you know Lord forgive me I'm sorry now I'm about to go to sleep Lord and you just bless me now watch over me Lord thank you Lord Jesus amen there's no blessing in that and yet you're sleeping in the middle of the five-minute prayer to MA so you know thanks whatever whatever you do as a grown man before those who have already raised children but I'm speaking to the parents now that have younger children whatever you do before then that's what they'll do so if you show them a five minute religion that's what they'll do when they get older then you wonder why are my children not serving the Lord why don't they like to come to the house of God why is it that they get bored and sleep in the middle of the service all the time do you do it you're not speaking to myself to now brother Anderson if you bring these scriptures up Zephaniah 1:12 it says and it shall come to pass at that time that I will search Jerusalem with candles and punish the man that I'll that are settled on their Lee's in other words complacent that say in their heart the Lord will not do good neither will he do evil that's kind of the thought of people today he'll let me pass me by with my five-minute prayer and my thirty minutes that I give to him at church you know yeah somehow I'll get through it you know you'd be surprised Hebrews 5 chapter 5 verse 11 it says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing saying ye are dull of hearing for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat bôla' to them that are full age even those who by reason of us of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil you have you have you had your senses to be exercised that way you know because the more yeah you know what since the more you give up to God the more he'll make you more responsible for you see then the one that gate that that got the one talent well he was supposed to get some interest for that you know he but the one they got you know the ten talent I was it I was at five I was about five max I can't remember but those that got the higher amount of talents they got more talents out of that you know got more interest for the master but the one that got that one talent he just went and hid it and gave it back to the Father and the end the end of master said you know we'll take what he's already what he's got take it away from him I don't want God to do that to me take away the gift that God has given in my life or whatever gift God has given you in your life because you don't use it for the kingdom of God you know you have more potential than want you then why then what you you know you do you weren't just created just to just sit 45 minutes sit of service and wanting to go home and 45 minutes there's more about this Christian walk Saints taking it by violence Isaiah 32 verse 9 rise up you women that are at ease hear my voice this is God speaking hear my voice you careless daughters give ear unto my speech many days and years shall be troubled ye careless women for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come tremble ye women that are ease though God was happy to see people at ease you know women this is Israel you know but the church women represents the church church be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your loins in other words repent Amos 6:1 woe to them that are at ease in Zion and Trust in the mountain of Samaria trust in the world which are named Chiefs of the nations to whom the house of Israel came in proverbs 10 verse 4 through 5 says he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich you know sometimes we just want to think about money when we read about this this when we read this scripture but I applied in all areas of life because one thing I admire about brother Dale and this has really helped me brother Dale has come to the point where he's at and this is not glorifying him or anything like that but he's come to the point where he's at because he's given time to it he's given time to study he's given and he the things that he reading and studying and in working and preaching and all these things all at the same time I admire him for that I remar him for that and it puts me as a young person younger than him I look up to him for that you know I want to be I want to be more like that more disciplined like that you know you think that he got do you think he got where he's at and you're wondering why am I not growing spiritually well I don't understand the Bible well you don't even pick up the Bible you don't even turn on a tape to listen to it you don't even relisted or preached at church there online on YouTube so I almost love to go to youtube and watch other things give time to other things but we don't give time to what's more important there services are there and you know you don't get everything just in one service now how many of us go back and relisting to the things that Burridge's that have been preached here there are a few because you can see how many views have been on there I'm wondering you know you wonder if it's maybe the people overseas they're there the ones that reviewing I'm challenged you are Saints it's time is it's going home time I want more of God in in in in in taking the kingdom on violence means something doing something radical in your life anybody that's ever made any change in their life is there has to been radical about it has to been radical about it Gandhi he made a radical decision one day and look where the nation of India now is you know that's just taking things you know Martin Luther King jr. look at that radicalness day he came George Washington crossing the Potomac River and all these the radical things that took place and we have the one that said that he'll be with us even in us to the end of the world and he we can't be radical about Jesus we just nonchalant about him Saints God God has you that's not taking the kingdom of violence amen so you know we feel that we are way past having to repent and travail before God that you don't need that anymore we're in the message we don't need none of that stuff's on the way you know we just read where God said that those who eat meat you know are the ones that have grown but never do we read that he's taking away the milk either and and even in Laodicea in Revelation chapter 3 when we he's telling the people they just see it to repent go back and do your first works over you know I've always had that stuck in my in my heart that and whenever I've gotten cold and informal before God and and starchy some of us have more starch than a big bowl of spaghetti tell you what when you know you want to praise God and you want and you want to get the enthused about God but we just you know we don't want to let go and let God have his way but you know one thing that I always thought wherever you leave God that's where you'll find him wherever you leave God that's where you'll find he's always waiting for you to come back to where you left him and if it was in your prayer life that's where you're gonna find him if it was in the reading I'm studying of the word that's where you'll find him if it was in coming to church frequently that's where you'll find God amen wherever you're at young people if it's obeying your parents doing what they're supposed to be doing if that's where you left God that's where you'll find God again amen amen repent though praise God so I'm gonna go a little quicker since the mechanics and the dynamics where the random we know he talked about mechanics and dynamics you know and it's important to have both the mechanics and the dynamics in order to make your vehicle run right you can have mechanics you know the other day we were at the mall and I saw Kia stepping up their game on their cars you know they're making them look really nice now it's nice and sporty and everything like that and they had this model car there in the showroom and I've thought to myself my goodness this is nice it almost looks like a Lexus you know very nice and everything I said my goodness but if they didn't have a gasoline tank to put gasoline and there's nothing it's just a bunch of shine a bunch of fluff bunch of fluff and nothing behind there nothing backing it up no spark no fire no nothing my goodness look look what brother Branham says here brother brother Anderson if you want to bring up that quote it is the rise another son that's what he proved hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shaken to life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead to the sunset he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's a again he was not only the mechanics God's Word he was the dynamics to prove it so he was not just a churchgoer amen he also did some things behind the scenes as well if you put it that way you do your time you do your time at home too until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride Amen for he said in John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day that's the Easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics look what he says here you can scream and shout and jump up and down and all you want to in the nidus word it won't do any good now we don't necessarily I'm talking to you all I'm not there no nominal Christians hear anything I'm talking to us message believers who believe God sent a prophet and believe this message they meant you can deny this word by the way you live by the way you take this word when you go back home that's need are you denying the word or are you or you for the word you can say oh I'm for the word because I've moved the church I did this and I did a little bit of something at church and I have this job at church but you go home and you do something else besides the word you don't get in that word you don't meditate in that word amen then you're denying the word you're just cranking around the Pistons off got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it buy it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves for every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God Kanaks with the dynamics notice is the spirit that quickeneth it's the spark that fires is not the gas that fires is to spark that fires the gas amen and that spark is the Holy Ghost amen you know the spark the Holy Ghost can only move a man as much as you feed it because he's not gonna feed off television and he's not gonna feed off the internet and YouTube videos and Facebook and Instagram and whatever is out there that's not what the Holy Ghost feeds off of how it goes feeds off this word amen and so it's so logical if the word is in you if the Holy Ghost is in you that's what you want to feed off right but if that desire is not in you then something is wrong something something's wrong you need to be at this altar I need to be at this altar repenting or whatever altar it is at your home or whatever do something amen be violent about God Saints amen follow falling amen you know Charles Spurgeon III like his his messages you know he he preached some really good salvations messages but this is what he had to say about about violin he preached the message in 1859 called holy violence and look what he said if he burned bring brother Anderson wanna bring that okay he's got it but this violence does not end when a man finds Christ it then begins to exercise itself in another way the man who is pardoned and who knows it then becomes violently in love with Christ he does not love him just a little but he loves him with all his soul and all his might he feels as if he could wish to die for Christ do you feel that way and his heart pants to be able to live alone with his Redeemer and serve Him without interruption that's why that's why I questioned when when you want to get out of here in 45 minutes I question things like that mark such a man who is a true Christian mark his prayers and you will see there is violence in all his supplications when he pleads for the souls of man mark his outward actions and they are violently sincere violently earnest mark him when he preaches there is no dull droning out of his monotonous discourse he speaks like a man who means what he says and who must speak it or else whoa would be unto him if he preached not the gospel now look what he says here in 1859 as I look around on many of the churches yay on many members of my own church I am apt to fear that they are not of God's children at all because they have nothing of this holy violence what would we say about about this day and that was in 1859 before we had internet what would he say about this day before we had cell phones before we had all these commodities that we have and that we enjoy and I thank God for all these things but that take our time so that we don't get violent about God now when the three thousand in the upper room after Peter and the disciples they received the Holy Ghost let's just read acts 2 verse 37 they were pricked at their hearts the Bible says now when they heard this after Peter gave them a whole you know they experienced the new birth you know after they everything that Jesus spoke to them and they received in three and a half years it was quick and they meant the Holy Ghost came and what happens when the Holy Ghost comes Amen it brings the word you desire the word amen now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter now it's interesting how he says it pricked in their heart in other words it cut them at their hearts it was violent to them amen it wasn't just something oh oh oh just kind of nonchalantly took place no it pricked them it caught it made them it really cut them amen and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles they did something about this man and brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you alright we know these scriptures verse 40 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received I always wondered you know what happened to the three thousand because we always think what happened you know to them didn't but but this is what this is what they did then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls and look what it says and they continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers I don't read here where it says that they fell asleep at church and they never studied at home you know then they continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and the Apostles doctrine wasn't their doctrine it was Jesus Christ's doctrine amen so that's they were steadfast in the doctrine of Christ and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers amen that was their desire that there's ours changed so they took some radical changes amen and you know in John 8 verse 31 it says Jesus saying this he says then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him you if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed we continue in the word if you're not just satisfied with just a small portion but you're you want more of God then are you my disciples indeed amen Jesus saying this and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free Christ said that Christ said that when you receive the Holy Ghost he shall lead you and guide you unto all truth amen and the Holy Ghost is his word amen so if you desire the word Amen you're gonna know more of him you're gonna know more about about truth you're gonna know about what it is that brother Dale is talking about here on Sunday morning what brother wait is talking about what these ministers are right here are talking about you're gonna know more you're gonna why because your steadfast amen you're continuing in his word amen now since that's violent because that that takes dying of yourself in order for you to do that and if you don't die to yourself violently then you won't have the blessings of the word in your life it's simple amen now finishing up here amen you remember when revelations aim in chapter 10 when when John and he was he was a the mighty angel but this angel came down from heaven we'll just read it here it says and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire we know that's Jesus amen and we know and look what it says and he had in his hand a little book open amen you and I are reading out of an open book Saints in this day it's not a closed book it's more open than even wasn't Charles Spurgeon story this is an open book Saints the capstone a man the headstone has come amen praise God this is an open book that's the reason why God is gonna he's really gonna ask this this layer to see at age why why are you so laxa Daisy and so lazy in the ad in his little hand an open book and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth so the angel amen the voice which I heard from heaven told him to go take the book amen and look what verse 9 says and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book so he came over there you know and made me a little give me a little book you know Jesus can I have the little book and he said unto me he said unto me this is John take it and eat it up violently something radical just take it I'm not gonna give it to you you take it amen and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be and I mouth sweet as honey I'm not giving you this book no no you're gonna take it it was violent wasn't it and it was open that's exactly right so it was an oak it was an open book that he was that John was taking hey men but it was it was a violent thing cuz Jesus Christ lunch is gonna hand it out Oh Christian life is so easy that way God just handles everything for you and it's so nonchalant and so easy oh my I wish it was that way it would be nice but there's work you've got to do there's work you've got to do amen and I took the little book no no I just continued and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter so he's already told him what the consequences of eating that book is gonna be that the bad part about it first I'll give you the bad news first Jesus said it shall make that belly bitter but it shall make they shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey is this word a man does this is this word sweet as honey to you when you come to the house of God when you're by yourself amen do you meditate on the word or are you wondering if somebody liked your post on Facebook what are you meditating on and I took the little book now see he burped he took it I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up he followed his instructions instructions and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter this word is gonna cause problems in your life with other people are not gonna believe what you believe things are gonna happen your family's gonna gonna reject you you know things are gonna have yours gonna be problems in your life my daughter was asking me the other day you know last night or two nights ago I believe in I said you know what sweetheart there's gonna be problems in life all the time but it's the way you handle problems is the way you deal around these problems and the way you you you you take these problems what is what counts I know but we're always going to have problems especially when that word of God and you're feeding on this word oh but I'm doing what you told me to do Lord you're still gonna have bitterness in your life you're still gonna have problems in your life but at the same time there's sweetness a man in your life as well when this word is being taken in oh yeah I hope you think about the word like that it's sweet lord it's honey to me it's it's it's it's life hey man it's I love the word Lord amen and then and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and we know John represents the bride amen we are to prophesy again I mean we are to speak this word amen this word is not just gonna stay in in book form not just stay in in the mechanical form and tapes it's got to be living Saints in you and me Saints it's got to be living the world will only recognize a Living Bible not a not not just scriptures not that you can show them something in the word a Living Bible lived out Bible but if you don't like to read the word and if you don't want the out tunity to speak to other people about the word then you won't get you won't get that privilege now we'll finish up with this brother Brad Anderson bring that accepting God's provided way at the end time 1963 that goes for God's children I could parallel that for you a man get up on say chew his chewing gum real well you know this this is a man it may be at church you know she was chewing gum real well you know father I'm here tonight if you want to give me the Holy Ghost all right I'm here but if you want to heal me I'm setting here but if you don't why all right it's your will Lord he's done wrote the will out here in the Bible it is his will to heal you it is his will to give you the Holy Ghost this is if you want it violently or not do you want to violently take the kingdom or not all right this is his will right here and if you want me to have it I'll have it but nevertheless if you don't why it's all right is that the attitude sometimes that we take you'll never get nowhere brother Branham says but let that one get there and cry out like buddy Robinson he stopped in the middle of the cornfield he tied up his mule he said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back you'll find the pile of bones laying right here that sounds pretty violent to me that's pretty radical that he was willing to do that are we willing to do something like that no because we have to go to work in the morning I'm going to stay here till I get it that's business and God wants to mean business with you God always recommends to his people his believing children to always go in his provided way that's God's idea to recommend to his children his provided way cry for what you have need of he wants you to cry out to amen praise God Thanks I want I want I want to have that like feeling like that brother buddy Robinson Amen Lord he blessed me with this word you blessed me with with your Holy Ghost say whatever whatever it takes to take what this out of my life a meant that I could be more like you than do it that's what I desire amen that's pretty violent you know Jesus spoke about Jesus talked about you know if your eye makes you sin cut your eye out I smiling if your foot make you sand cut your foot off that's pretty violent that's radical on your part now we know he's speaking spiritually you know but what he's saying is don't be laxed about this you take radical measures you want God you take radical measures about God you want more of Christ you want more of his word take radical measures take radical measures Saints amen I hope that something was said this evening that that that will that will and motivate you encourage you amen in in spark a fire under you amen and and take the things that are being said today in in the last several services and things and really ponder about these things not just take him as just another service just another you know routine type of thing and my goodness ask yourself am i closer to God then I was five years ago last year even last week and if you're not then get violent with God that's the only way and it's not necessarily I mean you get you take the kingdom a man yes but it's mostly it is mainly the kingdom getting inside of you amen praise God because if the kingdom doesn't get inside of you you won't get you don't you won't get you know Christ said that what is what is it he said he that coming out that draw they draw with him they forgot the scripture now it'll come to me anyways you won't come to Christ unless he draws you first that's what it is that's right there it is right there for the day thank you and so if you don't feel that putt at pool you don't feel that tug you don't feel that you know then then you're just here with peacock feathers on your on your Buzzard carcass right but a true Christian wants more of Christ amen praise God so let's have the musicians come ascend to our feet think about these things Saints yes ma'am let's pray that spray for sister Cletus she's having a terrible attack with her shingles and spasms and things so uh no way

be white as snow he says but he said come and let's talk about it looks deal let's deal with your sins amen let's deal with your laxness let's deal with your nonchalant of your of your ways amen amen God wants to deal with you amen so Saints I hope that that that you were helped this this evening and I trust that you don't take this and say oh that's just another sermon that's just another service no maybe the first quarter of this year wasn't the best year of your of your spiritual life this year let the rest of the year be that way and keep thinking the coming of the Lord is soon at hand amen am I prepared for that am I really prefer am I really prepared to receive amen to see because Saints amen one of these days these scriptures will be fulfilled those things will take place there right the Saints will raise amen where are you gonna be at there's gonna be people who believe this message who are gonna be here and go through a tribulation I hope that's not you how there's nobody here in this in this room that's like that come to Christ while you still can be found come to Christ amen quit wasting time quit wasting quit saying I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it next year I'll do it in the last minute that's what people said on the Ark of Noah and Noah's Ark they waited the last minute in the church and the doors were shut Noah did shut them no minister here will shut the door but one day God will shut the door this goes for young people as well don't waste don't don't wait till tomorrow don't wait till tomorrow do it while God can still be found amen praise God how many love the Lord amen praise God let's just bow our heads uni all hearts minds clearly yes by the way okay let's remember Bible study Saturday at 6 o'clock come amen come you will come if you can come you will come we knows we know that certain people you know it's tough for them and that's understanding but if you're close by and you don't come yeah when you can that that's part of taking the kingdom by force violently that's another radical thing amen overcoming the other weight says Amen praise God so remember that and also just also pray just pray for my wife she'll be out leaving in the morning around 11 in the morning so just remember her in prayer amen and continue to pray for my father-in-law because he's not a Christian and so maybe something that that maybe I don't know if he's just waiting for the last minute or what you know he's it's just he needs Christ and but claiming it we're all claiming it and I believe my mother-in-law cuz you know she was a believer I believe she was claiming him in his salvation and and so we're just believing on they men believing that God was doing something in his life amen so let's just bar heads our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once again for the opportunity to have heard your word Lord I pray that you'd help us to take the things father God meditate on them Lord God and look father God and examine our lives Lord am I at the
