ephesians 1 jonah 2 ephesians 1. remember all the sick among us because as many still having a lot of problems and things we're still i called the other day and talked to brother john and sister my uh how you say her name my he says my my but uh you know we just prayed the lord would touch them and or whatever i knew they were sick then but we hadn't heard anymore uh sister kathy's mother she's in the hospital i know you've you've prayed for but just keep praying because really as of yesterday evening and all brother ray called and said that they did not know what was wrong with her they have you know they will think it's this or that but they don't know for sure and they're running a bunch of tests and he said there was to be there at nine o'clock this morning so i don't know where anybody's got a text from him or anything since then to let us know but just remember that and i pray that the lord would be with her uh now remember to the brothers that we're going to the uh game eat out you know thing thursday night so make sure we all get together and find a place and get there and also remember the valentine banquet will be this coming saturday so remember these and pray the lord would would uh be with us and keep us all well during those times and things and to do okay any other announcements we generally miss hunting 100 of them but that ought to be enough all right going to jonah 2 and ephesians 1. father we thank you for your grace and your love and your understanding of us thank you for calvary and i pray that you would just have your way with each one of us today and let your love be there and manifest itself in the way that you'd have it to be father remember all of those that are sick knowing they're really still sick lord but doing better this morning and all of these are feeling better we thank you that you've touched them and brought them through these things and we ask you to just continue to work among us and manifest yourself through healing virtues and the power to deliver each one we love you we thank you we ask you to just lord forgive our sins because we know we we have problems and heartaches of life yet we trust in you as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts lord and just be with each one may they find what's wrong with sister kathy's mother there and get everything back on the mend and let your grace and love be with each one we love you we thank you in jesus name amen jonah 2 and we just dropped off the number 10 that's used in verse 9 because of our thought continuing he said but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving i will pay that i have that that i have vowed salvation is of the lord now you know jonah was delivered then because of that salvation ephesians now according verse 4 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the blood in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we're in he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that notice now with that holy spirit a promise all right not know half a dozen holy spirits it's that holy spirit which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory you may be seated lord at his blessing to the reading of the word good to see brother luis and his family back because we know that old flu bugs are striking everywhere and trying to do everything it can to hinder each one now i want to make a statement to you and i hope you'll listen to this statement and understand it see now to me the bible does not reveal a whole lot of things now listen very carefully he said well it revealed israel now the bible is the revelation of jesus christ all right now all the other is background a people that it was in a time that was on earth governments of this situation that situation all right so the bible is summed up with one point of saying the revelation of jesus christ personally to you and see that is the new birth all right now we'll get to that the lord willing maybe wednesday if we can but if not we'll catch our thought and move on all right but get the point now the bible doesn't reveal a dozen different things all right now it's a revelation of jesus christ so the bible now like wade is trying to emphasize a lot to us but listen to it the bible doesn't reveal the antichrist it reveals jesus christ and you see the antichrist going away you know riding away from you and understanding and things see that's what everybody's so confused about in the seals is they think the seals is revealing the devil now that's not according to your profit all right well i think it's revealing to satan in his way that is made known in opposition you've got your four combat beasts which is a line the oxaman the eagle then you've got four writers on the other side but that's not revealing the revealing of jesus christ is before combat beast so just remember the whole bible i'm writing a list and i will make a copy of it and i want everybody to keep it because i'm writing a list of things that are blunt statements all right and a blunt statement then everything else around has to be related to that okay just the statement i was making there from christ the mystery of god revealed brother brown said what is the new birth well the like i've told you emphasize what is the new birth it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you that's what the prophet said on christ the mystery of god revealed all right but did you understand the emphasis i was making this past wednesday on the basis that there's the prophet said there's over 200 denominational ways of understanding the new birth or born-again experience 200 i mean excuse me 900 right 900 different ways you don't think about that like i said wednesday you don't consider the fact the world is not you know it's not that they're right over here preaching seals and plagues and vials and trumpets and they're trying to preach the new birth every denomination is trying to preach salvation right what's the purpose of a church or anything but yet they're all confused i didn't say that see we're going to get down one of these days to believing that brother branham was a prophet that the word of god could come to and then we're going to see that listen we're going to see this got to be the way he says it and there is no other way to say it there's no other way to say it because he said it what is the new birth brother branham okay well i believe the new birth is shouting speaking in tongues crying doing this seeing vision that's not the new birth now brother donny not talking about the other day riding down the hunt and landing back you know when a baby is born all right now you know what i'm talking about and we know the story that most babies are born starting off crying because what did the prophet call it the shock we could use the big word now trauma you know the trauma of the baby coming into the world starts it to crying and breathing but you know what it has to receive life into the baby after it exodus exits the mother's womb now are we right we're not talking about caesareans we're not talking about all the other garbage in a normal birth all right that baby when it comes forth the life into the baby makes the baby cry you say oh it was crying yes it was crying it's not a life until it comes forth and the soul is breathing to that child right that's what your prophet says well i think see that's what i'm saying you don't believe brother brown was a prophet you can't stay with the message with our thoughts and ideas when that baby is delivered it doesn't cry before it breathes it breathes the breath of life even if you have to spank it or whatever has to happen or the trauma of it being born or whatever when it comes forth it who then it cries crying is your attributes speaking in tongues shouting all of those are not the new birth those are after effects those are the attributes coming forth from that to work if we get that into our mind and settle it it'd be easier to understand the new birth right see you could understand why brother brown would say now listen brother branham what is the new birth christ the mystery mr god reveal he said it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you well what's the new birth now he said it he said it's the revelation no we got shout out we got that let's see the emotional effects comes because the baby has breathed life see if you'd consider that it'd be a whole lot easier to understand the message like we're going to read again like we did wednesday they run around and said if their people understood the oneness of the godhead well you know what now forgive me i try to make emphasis so there's 900 churches or situations trying to explain a new birth but if they understood the oneness of the godhead they wouldn't have any problem that's right and you know yourself the biggest portion of organized religion does not understand the oneness of the godhead ain't talking about oneness brother and said i need one i'm talking about he said i resent that amen i i i you never think anything about that but to me it was a wonderful thought to me that god could speak to us and say look the whole world is trying to preach salvation in one way or the other but the world is confused about the truth of it now did your prophet make it he said if you do have the new birth he said you can't deny the word that's right well why have they denied this message now we're not talking about people that ain't heard it we ain't talking about all of that so you get those blumps into your mind and it it kills the thought but random even said he said i don't believe we're getting the people to jesus christ he said we're getting them to a doctrine amen well but then you got to remember one other thing he said a church without a doctrine is not a shirt but see there's got to be a truth right but you know what everything you look at the pyramid behind me it comes up to a peak point everything from there down has to be built according to that right so this thing peaks somewhere in a revelation of jesus christ now watch that in a minute when the prophet we read what what is the baptism of the holy spirit all right when you ask him a question and he answers it why is there so much thoughts related around trying to figure it out when he tells you what it is that's one church i sit and listen and i try to comprehend but where is the simplicity why has it turned down the simplicity of the message your prophet brought i said the other day it's you need to worry about preaching seals vials plagues trumpets and stuff like that to the people of this message to try to you know straighten them out if we don't get the new birth correct we're not going anywhere if we don't know what the baptism of the holy spirit is we're not going anywhere can i read you a quote from brother branham where he says if we don't understand the baptism we can't get it if you don't know what it is you can't get it well it could just come down see what come three or four messages down the road but see you're still in all kind of feelings and when i when we read today and the prophet talks about the baptism of the holy spirit listen to what he's saying but we say baptism it means something got to come from up there down here baptism means some kind of a something flowing over us water we relate water baptism in spiritual baptism we don't read the bible we don't listen to the prophet read the book of acts sure it says in the room was filled but where was the holy ghost the prophet said a lick of fire said on each one of them he said the holy ghost was inside may i ask you another question these are written down for other sermons to come when elijah was in the cave what did it say about him it wasn't the thunder the lightning the clouds to do in the whirlwinds the thing what was it somebody say it what was it said a still small voice well i guess he's sitting over here a little voice over the corner and said elijah no no no it was inside of him [Applause] that's where we're missing it so all right listen so let's start if we can to the point to not back up a whole lot but we've covered salvation as being deliverance and we've covered that throughout the old testament and coming up even into the matthew mark luke and john which was still under the old testament and jesus was under the law he came to under the law redemption them that were under the law and he even told the people to go off for sacrifices of moses and things because the law was still in existence until the law didn't end at calvary it didn't end at calvary when the holy ghost came because my bible says christ is what the end of the law for righteousness right is that the scripture so the law ended when the holy ghost came and started a new covenant a new testament and you couldn't have the covenant without the death of the testator that's according to hebrews see all right then there's the simplicity of it it shouldn't be anything well i think it's see those are flat statements the bible said that the holy ghost had not been given because jesus had not been crucified or glorified that which one is using it is that scripture amen well you know then where is there any argument or a thought that you have any other concept about the holy ghost than that well i think it's this over here i think see that's denominationalism that's thoughts of mankind the bible said it i see what was it he said one time i i would think of it in a minute brother brown was saying he said well we think about anything else he said the bible said it what do we think of anything else in the bible says it's just one god what does one of the commandments say the lord thy god is one well why we got all of these doctrines and ideas about it turn up the volume a little bit josh because i'm not my voice don't run too good and some of the sisters needs it a little better all right but listen so in the old testament we spoke of salvation as a deliverance to where that it preserved them and kept them and pointed to calvary and produ and went forward to calvary all right but then after calvary then on the day of pentecost you started the new testament the new covenant the new birth came into being the born-again experience came into being the baptism of the holy spirit came into being and we're going to read in a minute that the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost and the born-again experience is the same thing no i think you said i got a quote from brother branham so he's okay you start quoting those things to me we're going to really quote because you're gonna you're gonna as i said today you're gonna get so upset with me about this thing pretty quickly it's gonna do something and i'm just as serious as i can be in a crying in my heart because we're gonna nail it down to where there ain't no way if you get up and say i think it's so i'm going to tell you sit down and shut up that's what eve said you have no right to think then you're going to get mad at me so you think i'm hateful when i'm trying to save your soul your kid's out in the road well honey i wish you'd get out of the road huh come on no it's screaming and hollering all right so we come to in our thoughts we come up to the point of talking about the baptism of the holy spirit all right now what is your thoughts of the baptism of the holy spirit see we'll get back to these statements what did the prophet say he said one of the mysteries of the last days was to receive the baptism of the holy spirit without a sensation you need that jonah can pull it in a hurry but if you need it but you know what he never taught the new birth anywhere without an experience he never taught the baptism of the holy ghost without an experience he never taught the new birth or born again or anything without an experience but without a sensation i know this is way ahead because i'll repeat it coming back across but what about the man that found the track i'd like for you or your computers to go home and run that in it and you'll find brother random five times explaining that man and more than six or seven more as parts explaining you know what mentioned in it and that man picked up that track and read it but read what he says the man doing see we think the man read the track and he went down and he just played along brother didn't say that that man got deadly serious he got so serious he said he supported all the preachers he gave his money away he said i had a half a million dollars and sold all my cars and said i got no junk now whenever were to everything speaking in tongues shouting went to every one of them and they finally told him said you need to go to william branham because he's a prophet and he can discern out he come to brother branham and run around and listen to him talk a minute of his life and he said you don't need anybody to do this or shout at it he said what you need to do is just plain language what he said you need to sit down and listen and the guy said in other words what literally said do you remember he picked up that track now i didn't make the statement brother random i know makes it four times i'm pretty sure five and maybe six or seven because i know they assumed that they're just part statements of this point the man said you mean i got it right there he said yes you got it right there but you see we know all about the new word and brother random told him all of those things and one of the statements he said all those things you've done was good he said we believe in shout out we believe in this we believe in speaking in tongues he said but but you got it back there he said when you become to that point he said you become converted well maybe we were to think a little bit about all of this instead of all this emotional side of everything but just remember there's other statements from brother branham he said uh what they called it about a baby born with no life he said it's a dead baby he said anywhere the holy ghost comes it's going to be life but that ain't the holy ghost that's because of something happening in you i wish we could get that down and just listen to it you say well i think we do brother i do but okay let's start off so we got up to talking about we read these things we will re-read them as we're going in to it but we got into the point of talking about why we changed this title of the service and what sermons we were talking about salvation and using that as an old testament form and using it as deliverance and having it as a tops in the shadows you know of the new testament but what they had back there in the old testament did not bring them eternal life so if you brought what they had in the old testament to the new testament and left it without jesus christ you'd have the same people and that's what the world has done they've left jesus christ out of their birth it's the same as you know that's when i i scream i know and i'm sorry i was screaming i listen to that message twice i screaming you say well i believe abraham was going to offer his child that's the believer that we claim to be standing upon as the father of our faith right he'd make a real good believer today wouldn't he when he gonna take his son out and kill him because god said it it's your hate for him to tell me to do that i'm serious but listen we come up to this statement we ended it right around speaking in the third seal and he's talking about coming to the baptism of the holy ghost and he said they had to go up to pentecost and wait that's where we ended at had to go to the pentecost and wait right then the holy ghost came and that fulfilled acts right 1-8 where jesus had told them during acts 1-8 you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you'll be my witnesses sometimes he said all right because they didn't have it well i never heard anybody teach anything like that well is it the truth well i thought that saved back ain't nobody said them people back i wouldn't save i never taught nothing like i didn't teach that in the baptist church i thought they were saved but i knew in the baptist church that jesus christ had not died and then without the death of the testator you couldn't have a new covenant i knew the book of acts was the first book in the new testament i didn't have to read matthew because you asked most people what's the first book of the new testament they'll go to matthew matthew's still under the law the book of acts is the first of the new testament you see we would have read those things all right see they were great believers they were justified they were set aside and brother branham says that when they i'm paraphrasing a quote that he gave he said they actually when they repented of their sins he said that cleanse that that took away from their sins he said but then before jesus would send them out he said they got to sanctification he said when they come to sanctification then jesus sent them out to preach because he didn't let them do it until they came to that place and had power to cast out devils heal the sick do all kind of miracles and things right but yet didn't have the baptism and holy god and jesus told peter said peter after you're converted peter said what do you mean i'm converted i started following you i left my mama i left my mother-in-law i left my wife i left everything and come with you and i'll live with you three and a half years and listen to you over what you've taught and to believe all you say and you're telling me i'm not converted because that's what he told nicodemus you're not converted but listen then what happened what happened after that the holy ghost has come upon you you shall be witnesses then unto both in jerusalem and even to all of the earth after the holy ghost has come upon you you know the story upper room what was it doing well i think we got it it was reading one the other day and it really makes it look like you know maybe peter and you know brother ryan will just say words and and you put but one of the disciples said i think we need to take it by faith we've been up here nine days now somebody said yeah but we ain't got what he said which was power from on high and i always emphasize that right you go out there you go tell them about this new new message and they gonna kill you and he says i think we need to sit down and wait for something from coming on high because we ain't got it right that's what's wrong with the world today may i say what your prophet said without you thinking i'm making somebody lost or something he said there billy graham he said why didn't billy graham stand on that ground over there and call for god to come he said god would have honored him come on read your message he said god would have honored a man he said and still if not he said why didn't he say there's somebody in america we'll call for them to come because why because he didn't have the power he said you know but he remember okay all right so then you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you so what is the holy ghost power from on high to birth us into the kingdom of god bringing salvation to our souls not just to power from on high they already had power he doesn't give them power to cast out devils heal the sick right so it wasn't that kind of a power that come on the death pentecost what came on the day of pentecost brother branham says they can catch up with you too but i'm going to try to read a lot of these to save time brother branham says in the smyrna church age page 140 we'll read these again in a while they don't have to put it up now before we leave this subject i want to make myself clear on what the baptism with the holy ghost is according to the word it is not according to me and it's not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the lord or we are falsely led all right now i'm going to give you copies of these then i'm going to say what is the baptism of the holy ghost we're going to say brother branham said that what it is has got to be according to the word and what it is has got to be according to thus saith the lord so if somebody comes up to you outside or anywhere and they say what is the baptism of the holy spirit say it's got to be according to the word it's got to be according to thus saith the lord it'll stop all that we haven't even have yeah let's see it'll stop on it i think it's his don't you think his name i kind of believe it's here i don't know i believe it's out of it it'll stop all of them believe me babies it'll make it serious right come on we read this we went on to what is the what is is it that so many christians find it hard to live a christian life right around talking about the new wine busting them you know a new wine putting no bottle bust it all right but if you put the new wine into a new new bag that's what it was back there you know with your skin and the new skin has oil in it flexible and when the holy spirit comes down and says now when the holy spirit comes down and says now who's saying it the holy ghost well holy ghost knows who the holy ghost is the holy ghost knows what the holy ghost is right then when the holy spirit comes down and says the baptism of the holy spirit is the same today as it ever was well i think is i've got them don't worry about it it's in a message called blasphemous name he said holy ghost holy ghost holy ghost holy god come on there's one whole section in the church age book that's dedicated and we're going to read a whole lot of it to the statement that it's the holy ghost in every age it was never the holy ghost it was taken away luther had the holy ghost wesley had the holy ghost zeus had the holy ghost amen it was never taken away it was the word that went down the holy ghost then can only work according to the word so it could only work in luther's day according to the simplicity and the thoughts of justification but it was still the baptism of the holy spirit or he's not in the body of christ and when the holy spirit comes down and says the baptism of the holy spirit is the same today as it ever was all right what it was still is or hebrews 13 8 is missing it somewhere right now but that one we read up there was prayer or page 144 of this american church age listen to this go ahead and pull up number four we'll just start from there and i'll back up to one i didn't give you but brother brown i'm on page 154 the submarine church age what is the baptism with the holy ghost and he said up here we've got an it's got to be thus saith the lord so now what is thus saith the lord about the baptism of the holy spirit it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth don't forget that one see it is the spirit of god coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in the water an answer of a good conscience toward god what is the baptism of the holy ghost it's the spirit of god baptizing you into the body it's the new birth now where do we get to what the new birth is then you'll see why we gave those emphasis that you can without a sensation something what is the new birth brother branham goes on questions and answers on the seals and he said talking about the ages taking a dip into to the holy spirit now listen to it justification is a work of the holy spirit sanctification is the work of the holy spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit now what's he saying justification is a work of the holy spirit it's the holy spirit that comes in and causes you to repent you know the goodness of god is what the bible said leadeth thee to repentance is that scripture it's sanctification that carries you to where that you're repenting and trying to stay daily cleansed but that's still not the baptism you're not in the body of christ each one of those ages only taking a dip into the holy spirit because see luther and them couldn't come forth with the fullness as i said a moment ago they didn't know the word it was the word that was eat down it was not the holy ghost eat down how can you eat the holy ghost down it's the fact how much of the holy ghost could operate and he could only operate according to that situation right now then what did we cover trying to get over to a point what did we cover brother branham says now he's taught justification the same case in baptism and holy ghost right so in the future home paragraph 78 what did he say how he led us to himself to tabernacle in us by three stages of grace just like he's led the world in three stages and come to the world as god will come to the world after it's gone through these different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of grace i taught that at the beginning now can you read i've never changed since since it's god's word so now here anything we get from now on now here's where brother daley is why i said you're going to think i'm stern i'm stern anything we get from here on after reading that and you say well i think it's this i'm going to tell you you have no right to think he said it if he's the prophet we believe him now he said that he'd always talk i taught that at the beginning i never changed since yeah but brother that i remember when he said you're born again baptized into the body that's exactly right it's just got to be put in the right place and the prophet's got to put it in the right places right come on look at the next one paragraph 86 the future home wait number seven notice how god makes it plain to us and if that wasn't a great confirmation a good a great loving blessing from god when i see this and see that since a boy first time ever christ dealt with me i've always taught those three stages of grace now what about it let's see if i can find one i don't think i gave it to him but let's see if i can find that one i never gave him this but listen to this off the paragraph 25 26 of the seed is not aired with a shook 1965 2 to 18. he's talking about your message will forerun the second coming john the baptist before run the first coming your message before run the second coming this is 30 years later and here i am tonight proclaiming that message and around the world has went and i'm glad to be back in my hometown tonight to represent this lord jesus christ that i still love with all my heart each day he grows still sweeter than he was the day before i've never changed one iota in my doctrine [Music] the first thing i started with i still believe the same thing tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever now i've got a message i'm responsible for he said never changed when i owed him amen now how many of you when that statement was made said well what about when he preached the white horse rider what about it what about when he preached the white horse rider as the holy ghost what about it was there anybody in the world that could straighten him out if it is i'd like to see their name hear their voice or whatever you want to do was there anybody a prophet stands before god in god alone and the prophet never knew the truth of the white horse writer so thereby he was not responsible he was responsible for preaching what the bible has taught and mankind had taught of the bible he had that correct the white horse rider under the seals had not been brought to no man so you can't judge brother branham with that it had never light had never shined there so get away from saying well i think well you say he never preached any error he never changed his doctrine he said but he did change doctrine show me where he changed well right there he shane you're out of the word because i didn't even know scripture brother brown was one that had to tell us what that white horse rider was cause the light had never shined on that you see what you're doing besides you know i think that's stern enough for myself but you know besides that you ever thought about you ever thought about what i've said while ago that the bible is the complete revelation of jesus christ the bible is not revealing no antichrist it reveals jesus christ and you see satan riding off okay so brother brown was right he never changed a doctrine because his doctrine has always been one god god not in three persons almighty god revealed as one true and living god what does seals reveal now if the seal's revealed get this point where you can hang this onto his message if the seals were revealing the antichrist then brother branham was wrong when he made that statement and he made that statement that i just read he made that statement off of the seed shall not be air with a shock or see not air with a shock in 1965 when he said i never changed one iota wouldn't it be something though somebody's saying brother brandon right around wait a minute wait a minute i got you he said what are you talking about brother you talked to a white horse rider was the holy ghost he was wrong he said you're exactly right well you change your doctor he said no i didn't he's because that never been revealed to nobody he said i never changed one iota of the written word of god you understand do you understand it's not what you and i think about it it's what god says about it you realize your prophet come on you've been in the message long enough he said the light had never shined on that but when light shined on no seals what did it reveal oh it revealed the antichrist boy you're really smart it had to be a futherment of the revelation of jesus christ because you couldn't have the bible as the written form or we're talking about up until 62 or somewhere in there revealing jesus christ and then the seals revealing the white horse rider as the antichrist look what a mass confusion you're in you've got half the word revealing one god the other half revealing the devil and there's no such thing is that enough so we're going to hold a point what brother branham said that the baptism of the holy ghost was going to have to be made known you said they can run this if they want to number 2a is supposed to be in there but it doesn't matter because we read it wednesday on blasphemous names paragraph 90 through 93. i believe that's the reason that there is so much confusion today about the holy spirit read this up here on the board it's not correctly talked believe that the baptism i believe that the baptism is taught but it's like you say automobile spark plugs this goes with he said and when you talk about the baptism of the holy spirit there's a lot that goes with that there's a lot goes with that and jesus is what he said saying is he's here to reveal it all right so what is it what is the baptism with the holy spirit and that he taught it correctly all of his life but yet we want all these things okay do you agree to these with us having to read all of the things that the spiritual birth requires three stages of grace before the person is truly born again they asked him that question he said absolutely the spiritual birth requires all three stages of grace before the person is truly born again all right it just explained that this morning you've got to have all three stages you're begotten of the spirit just like a baby's begotten into the wound of a mother but not born until you receive the holy ghost that's right you're born then you're not converted see you get what he's saying you're in the process of being converted until that time so what is the new birth it's three stages it's justification and sanctification and the baptism of the holy spirit justification is a work of the holy spirit where does it work if i'm up there is it coming down and he can do what he wants to he can he can do it and he will or was justification something inside of you working to repent of your sins well that's where the holy ghost was working at what about sanctification what about the baptism already goes on to the message healing and what what cancer is he says when a man is born again of the spirit of god there was three elements came from the body of jesus that we go through to be borne again of the spirit of god water blood and spirit is that right pierce this side to come out it will come through justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit into the body of christ the three now you see all the natural that's what constitutes the natural birth water blood life right that's what constitutes the new earth justification sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit all right he goes on into the message he swore by himself and said not three works of grace but one work in three different manifestations same holy spirit was with luther under justification was under wesley with sanctification in the church now in the baptism of the holy ghost the same holy spirit not two holy spirits the same holy spirit he explains on the medic dedication of the building we read that he talks about your body spirit and soul your three compartments you talk about god working the church is perfected through justification and sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost then you're sealed into the until the day of your redemption right what did we read the other day off the message israel in the church then the soul returned back in the form of the baptism the soul the soul of god amen because that's what he gave is a ransom right and the soul came back the anointing was the spirit of god right and you can have that every day and miss it that's right those old testament people had the anointing of the holy spirit but they didn't have the soul of god because it's never been opened up to bring out that's right all right returns back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost and he goes on into the message of perfection but god himself came that his own spirit which is the highest line of the form came back what god himself came back that the his own spirit in the highest form look came back or come back can come back by the form of the baptism of the holy ghost holy spirit to the worshipper through the blood of jesus christ and take him into the body now your new birth is in your soul it is not your body it is not your spirit we'll go back through that some more but that should be enough that we can understand that i started right back over because what i was doing what is the baptism with the holy ghost it's the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ go ahead 154 or you can pick that talk and carry it on down it's spirit coming in and feeling you after you've repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience now he explains explains it so this is not brother dale explaining it it's we're reading it what we have just set forth would be much easier for all to understand if all believe the doctrine of the oneness of the godhead for there are not three persons in the godhead but one thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of jesus christ coming in and then subsequent which means afterward to that the holy spirit coming in to give us power he said that's not true if that were true see if you're born again by one and then this other happens if that were true see there's only two being dealt with up here that's been see you saved with us we're born again by the spirit of jesus christ coming in and then after that the holy spirit comes he left the father out so now read it if that were true why are we dishonoring the father but not giving him a part in our complete salvation for our salvation is of the lord and there are three lords then he father must have something to do too but surely it can be seen that jesus made this very clear that it was he and he alone who is god and is he and he alone who is coming into the believer then he goes to john about the comforter they send a comforter he says it covers the comforter it's jesus covers on down now listen so he says now in verse 23 and speaking to the disciples he said we father and son now will come unto him thus it's the father son and the holy ghost all coming in at the one time for it is one person comprising the godhead then read that and listen think about it this is the father son and holy ghost all coming in at the one time but it's not one person compre i mean for it is one person comprising the body so there's just one god and he said that took place at pentecost now it can't be one person justifying you one sanctifying you and one feeling you now that can't be you say but he's saying there that it's one one person comprising the godhead that's right he's talking about the baptism he ain't talking about justification sanctification and then the baptism he's talking about the baptism read it justification is not the baptism of the holy ghost sanctification is not the baptism of the holy ghost neither one of them is the person of jesus christ living in you it's the one person coming in you comprising the godhead so when you receive the new birth i remember when i made that statement about 30 years ago and everybody i said the new birth is father son and holy ghost coming and dwelling in you at one time and man everybody's it took me months to explain that enough to where people would settle down and listen the baptism of the holy ghost is the person of jesus christ justification not the person it's the work of that person upon you sanctification is not the person it's the work of that person upon you but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the one god coming in at one time that's what happened to us trying to explain to you wednesday amen that's what happened back there it took the disciples three and one half years to get justified and sanctified right but they still wouldn't convert it they still didn't have the baptism in the holy spirit they still had to go to the upper room and wait on the baptism what about three and a half years going through justification baptism and holy god church i know and i know what was tried to be taught right here and i agree with it to a degree but i told the brother i didn't agree with him to the degree you ever heard it taught a lot of people you don't have to wait on the holy ghost you just get it well it's totally going waiting up a room but the point was good it was right some people believe all the way right at one one time at the altar they can believe all the way through justification and sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost right there in one thing but then i'll quote the rest of this message here brother brown said very few will all right so we got an occasion that we got to cover that it can happen because it happened three and a half years and the disciples got finally the baptism outside three thousand got the holy ghost in a 30-minute sermon they went through justification sanctification and baptism and holy ghost in a 30-minute sermon a few days maybe to the house of cornelius so the visions and the doings and the traveling but they received the baptism of the holy ghost and said the same as we did at the beginning why because it was brand new and god was there to engulf anybody that would believe him but you said well what happened the devil got in and he started telling the people you need to do this you need to do that what was brother branham's statement one time he said where it says you know repent everyone will be baptized in the name of jesus christ he said we tell them what to do and what not to do right well come on up to the altar and get your baptism right and then repent everybody's in the building and get all that done and then we're going to pray for you to get the holy ghost ain't no bible they went in the bible in bible times you know what i'm talking about bible times writing of the bible of the apostles none of them went that away the closest you can get is apollos but remember apollos knew nothing about jesus christ being crucified read your bible that we know nothing about this did we only know from john that jesus was the christ but the holy ghost came but why can't why you can't get the holy ghost on people today because you're sitting there wondering what's going to happen you're wondering what's brother dale doing you're wondering how that we can do this how you're wondering what's down there for to eat you're wondering what's going on you're trying to do this you're trying to figure out this i wonder is mama all right i wonder daddy all right i wondered everything running all right you know what i'm talking about it's a devil coming into you and getting you to sit there and entertain thoughts that the holy ghost can't come through because the holy ghost can't come through and override your free moral agency is that right he can't override you for immoral agency he can't make you take something you have to invite him in no but brother dale i got all this see that's what i'm saying there he goes to running yeah but i got word he chose me i didn't choose him that's right but if you don't accept him he can't save you now get your thoughts he just saved me and then i accepted him one day well yeah he did for the sound ladies in the world it's gonna go that way but you see church i try i cry and i try and i pray god give me some way he gives me thoughts and i come to you but does it dwell within you brother branham draw out those things he drawn out the church he drawn out that first church all white except a little dark either bottom or top of one place he left a little dark he said that was the antichrist or the devil the next church age it went down the next church age it went down or the amount of white until the fourth church age you had a whole black circle with a little bit of light see that's what's wrong now you can't say it and listen without the brain running i know that and then no way have i ever said okay now what we need to do is we need to just blot out and go blank because brother said you don't do that he said the devil will come in okay well wouldn't that be a good thing if we could blank us all out now the devil come in so what good have we done well the devil don't do to me he didn't talk to me i always try to be honest i was listening earlier the other day and i heard myself on that two times saying it i said the devil talking to me about 99 of the time well you need to get straightened out i agree with you i'm trying but i'm telling you you're right there with me maybe 96 and a half instead of 97 percent don't tell me what you're sitting there thinking i'll quote a brother he said he was listening to me preached one time and he told me later he said i figured out how to fix that tractor and you preaching you really enjoyed that didn't you yeah i mean he's honest he just said it you know but what about it do you see what i'm talking about it's got to work now that it takes time listen it takes time to go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost i spent from 58 to uh we'll just make it 66 give or take a little 67. i spent that in the baptist church i'd become work so much and talked so much until when i left the church i was teaching the adult sunday school classes which was the deacons and elders and their wives so you can see what they honored i was a sunday school teacher i was a sunday school superintendent at the same time i had to get all the records together and still teach the lesson i was a training union director i had to run all of those things i was i don't can't remember so many more but i was a deacon you know they thought a lot of me they never run me out you can say they run me out of shirts when i took kids they never run me out my brother walked out and he said what do you want a church i'll build we'll build you a church my mom said where you going i said i don't know i said i know where i'm going to church for a while but i don't know what i'm going to do but you see something had happened to me but i was just in justification and sanctification i came in this message and for two years i sought the baptism of the holy spirit you've heard my testimony don't get dull with it it happened two years in this message i would never claim the baptism of the holy spirit whatever basically one of you right now sitting here says that you've got the holy ghost because you believe the message of the hour or in some form you know i've done this it brought me to here and it brought me to there instead of going back and sitting down and thinking what happened to you we get over into new birth i'll take my whole experience and put it in the bible but you see it finally had to come to a time that it was settled in the soul of an individual okay listen so what is it you're not born again by the spirit of jesus christ coming in and then later are subsequent to that the holy school holy spirit coming in to give us power and we're going to read brother brown and said that's exactly what happened but you're going to have to find out what he's talking about well who are you to say who are you talking about i'm me who are you no problem we get that settled but listen he said thus it's the father son and holy ghost coming into you at one time it's not the father justification the son of sanctification and the holy ghost it's justification a work of the holy spirit it's sanctification the work of the holy spirit it's the baptism of the holy spirit which is the person of jesus christ coming and living in you which is the father son and the holy ghost all because it's not tree it's one it's one god all right okay i like it this one i just put it in as a next one because it's continual reading once you start reading at 144 you're going to find what i'm reading here is a continual reading out of the church age book we will continue that in a minute but look what he says on on 144 which starts with number one then the number two will be going on so you want to listen so so you can see now that we cannot afford to say what the bible has not said when scripture teaches us that the work of the holy spirit and the manifestation of that holiest of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time that is exactly correct okay then he starts back over with a statement i'd unread two or three times go ahead and continue just pull it up we'll read fast as we can and quit before we leave the subject this is a continuation of reading now i want to make myself very clear on what the baptism of the holy spirit is according to the word it's not according to me and it's not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the lord or we are falsely taught i read these to you wednesday you say well you just keep reading it i'll probably read it again this coming wednesday okay if you won't stay at home okay you turn on the internet you're going to hear it look to begin with you will notice that in my meetings now watch him explain something he explains if the denominational mix-up of the churches and what they think and what they do shows what they think to begin with you will notice that in my meetings when i have finished preaching an evangelistic service or some teaching message i cast a net and an invited response from the people i ask them to come forward and receive the holy spirit now listen he's asking to come forth and receive the holy spirit now watch what they do my pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that i say this believe that i am inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the holy ghost because they're already born again see they think they're born again by the receiving our believing right something caused them to start their journey so they believe that was the born-again experience and then when he's asking them to come and pray for the baptism of the holy spirit look what they say he said be baptized with the holy ghost because they're already born again so when i invite those who are spirit-filled to come and have wonderful how sweet and that guy can talk i can't talk that away and i'm sorry but i don't have to worry about it either i can't he look what he talked invite those who are spirit-filled he never throwed off on people in other words said to be in me you know what i said i said if you and so when when i invite those who are not even born again yet to come up and help pray that's what i'd say but he's nice he called someone you ever noticed him he said yes they're christians he said oh robert's billy graham he said hey allen he said he's a man of god he's a great christian i wish i could do that so when i invite those who are spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit now he didn't say to get justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost he's teaching what to get them to get the spirit the holy spirit the new birth read it those who answered the invitation to receive the spirit those dear ones search forward and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to god and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and i want to tell you exactly what i mean now when he gives an altar call what does he mean he gives an altar call if i was giving an all the call today i wouldn't say now now what i want you to do some of you come i want you to come up and i want you to repent i want you to be baptized and i want you to do this and i want you to do that i want you to be justified i want you to be sanctified i want you to do this no i ask you to come up and be filled with the holy spirit because you know what if you are it'll take care of all them other things right it'll take care of the life the prophet he said i want to tell you exactly what i mean i mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again now listen to it he said up here to receive the spirit watch him forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of christ by the holy ghost which is what took which is exactly what took place at pentecost when the church was launched amen he's wanting a pentecostal experience to come to people and they're trying to get them to speak in tongues and shout and all these other things because they've been taught that i stood in jamaica and in a way i rejoiced in the way i cried because how was i going to take on 300 people wade and we got there about that time but that would have mean about three of us against 300 people how was we going to handle that when those people down there was taking them little children i've never seen that you've been there i didn't they were taking them children and saying say it say it say it say it say it say it trying their best to get them little children because i had invited the children to come to the altar to be saved what did i mean to come and receive the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth but they would speak speak speak say it say it say it say it i wanted i'm sorry i wanted to go down there and take him and go you say yeah i mean i wanted to throw him out the door because he was falsifying the new birth to them kids that i had gotten to the altar for salvation what if they'd look back and said brother dale you've got them in the altar now come and lead them to christ they wouldn't do that at all no way okay in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the holy ghost it is one and the sign to be born again and baptized into the body and to have the new birth is all one of the same he goes let's get this one he said i realize it's going to be confusing for a moment because most people know that i was ordained a baptist preacher you see they think he was saying just believe come on just believe that what was he saying about him everybody knows he'd ordained the baptist preacher they was thinking well you know he was saying they're going to think i'm just a baptist and we baptist just get out when we believe so what'd he say i have steadfastly declared that the baptist have missed it for saying you receive the holy ghost when you believe for that is not so you received him since you believed amen too late to try to continue let's stand come on brothers while they're coming think about what i'm saying because this is two services on the same thing and if i don't care to preach three more and i just tell you if you want to lay out go ahead do what you want to because it ain't going to change me i set myself aside years ago for one thing to preach the gospel i'm open for discussion of anything i preach or anything that i'm doing but now you tell them and tell me that the holy ghost is going to lead away from this i'm going to tell you holy ghost don't do that there is only one new birth it's been the same in every church age it was the same as the day of pentecost they went through justification sanctification and the holy ghost fell the three thousand outside went through justification sanctification and the baptism right there at once you say how could that be that's what i tried to explain when a moment ago on a rare occasion a person could come to the altar especially a sinner you ever noticed brother branham he said one altar call in africa and 35 thousand or 25 thousand born-again christians it's possible that a human being because of not being taught and drug about by all the doctrines could come to an altar and right there god could go through as a cleansing of a repentance and give the person the new birth but it's very rare so then it's going to be as i saying about the brother that tried to preach it here he's saying there ain't no such thing and the bible is tearing for the holy ghost i said they did an upper room i said no you can i know what he was trying to say he was trying to say what i was trying to say we ought to believe all the way through it one time but very few people's going to do it i ain't going to ask no raise of hands but how many of you believed through at one time i've been honest enough to tell you i was two years in this message like one brother told me he said i know my my i know they got the holy ghost because you don't cut the hair and wear long dresses well okay i didn't want to be aggravating and arrogant you think i am but you know what the girls in my day wear long dresses and didn't cut their hair the worldly girls because they knew what a woman looked like come on you say brother dale you're no no i'm not i'm telling the god's on his truth they knew what a woman looked like it seemed like maybe the world don't know it now we'll go ahead what we got let's see it's one verse or something and if anybody has a need come on and we'll believe remember wait this afternoon [Music] just praise the lord bless him and give us the word [Music] father we send this prayer claw to our brother's wife and just ask you to take care of all the problems let everything be all right we believe it and we thank you in jesus name anybody else do you know you have the baptism of the holy spirit you know well i've never done things that other people say they done when they got it forget that that's a copycat trying to be what somebody else is but it's your own experience and let god deal with you in your own life [Music] it ain't what mama done daddy done brother sister [Music] he says what are you gonna do i met this [Music] needs his prayer claws to take it we believe it'll take care of whatever he's asking but he said he needed to touch from you so father just drop down beyond all mental capacities of the human mind [Music] in jesus for something happened and now i know i want to ask you one simple question [Music] now is this true that sozo sorry how you pronounce that word means to be delivered right and brother brown said it's the same [Music] for the human healings and the time he said it's a sign for the soul is that true well now how many of you have ever been healed i mean literally know the time or there's something in your life that you've healed [Music] did it come with shouting [Music] then why would you want to put the holy ghost coming and shouting or crying or speaking in tongues or some manifestation when you don't want to put the healing [Music] listen to the point when you're healed it's something just comes down and sure you can have feelings you can have all that but you know what i'm talking about [Music] it's just a knowledge that comes to you [Music] it's the knowledge sometimes he says we were up in canada hunting [Music] wade was having a lot of trouble with his back we were going to be there about three or four days hunting and brother dean we were there together and he said we were talking he said we need to lay hands on and pray for him i said yeah let's do it i didn't go lay hands on and pray for him because when i seen him touch wade i knew that he was healed i got the knowledge they went through the act you're going to find out one of these days that new birth is a knowledge to you [Music] then you'll shout then you'll cry and then you'll have the baby screaming and hollering because you got it here [Music] what about it father just be with us we will wait this afternoon as he ministers the word unto us we pray that you'd bless and guide each one forgive our sins and lead us in your love in jesus name amen you dismissed [Music] it happened and now i know he touched me and he made me oh he touched me
