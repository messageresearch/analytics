========================================

eyes of my heart Lord Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you oh I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my I want to see you yes I want somebody to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your lorry for out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy thank you Lord High and lifted shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy thank you Lord you are holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you hey man good to be in the house with Lord good to be back here and worshipping Him in spirit and in truth good to have everybody online watching in and maybe some new ones god bless you from spoken word church here in Lula Georgia we are doing what the state of Georgia has asked us to do with ten people and stay six feet apart and we're washing our hands more than we probably ever have and so we're doing the best we can with all with God but we're going to try to get the Word of God out so the people can hear and so that you will not know that we are cowering away from this thing but I saw a post the other day that told us that you know I believe in God I have faith in God but when I opened the oven to get us something hot out of the oven I use oven mitts yeah when I get in my car I put a seat belt on but still I have faith in God so we know one thing's for sure that god I like what brother Brady told me a long time ago when I first met him he said brother wait God gave us five senses use them use them you know so he gave us a responsibility to take care and we're supposed to be the cleanest people on the earth anyway you know so we're supposed to be practicing these things and and while you're sitting at home enjoy enjoy being with your spouse enjoy being with your kids sit down and commune with them and get to know them a little bit better and get to know your spouse a little bit better that's a bring us a little bit closer to each other and closer to God too so god bless you and we thank you for all the prayers and and the support we get from the church and and like I said we're brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday we'll use this same format that we're using now and hope everything is okay at home I know everybody wants to be here but let's do our part right now and as we do our part right now and that means that if everybody else would do their part around the world then with the social distancing and washing your hands and all that that we will this thing will come to a close I was thinking you know we were talking the other day about how Moses when the children of Israel would go that they do something awful and and God has sent a plague and and Moses would tell Aaron to run through the crowd with a sensor we got to remember they was people died sometimes up to 20,000 before God stayed the plague so I that's what we're praying that I hate that anybody dies I was thinking last night I thought men if they didn't know the Lord we got a lot of people that are passing away from the earth without without knowing God but God knows that he knows who they are and but we're just gonna pray for Humanity we're still human beings and as I said downstairs in the Sunday school class you can you can blame China you can blame Trump you can blame whoever I say let's just blame ourselves let's just blame our self that we haven't come to a place to where we can walk in Gainesville Hospital and just everybody be healed you know so blame yourself blame us that we're not in the position and I believe we're getting there but I I just want to put all the blame on me all the blame on me I'm the I'm the reason the raptures not took place I'm the reason brother Dale can't preach all the time like you should I'm the reason that some people act the way they do and if you'll all agree instead of blaming everybody else don't blame everybody else just blame yourself and just say hey Lord fix me first if you'll fix me first then maybe God will speak to you I was thinking this morning and and I'm not being I guess I'm not being mean but I'm interpreting you know brother Brown was talking about the 10th vision okay well the 10th vision was people were going in the tent getting healed and walking away and I thought about it the other day I started looking brother Danny all these hospitals now have them big long white tents in front of them and the people are going in and some are not making it but some are coming out feeling better some so maybe we need to pray that God will anoint those doctors and anoint somebody to create a vaccine instead of trying to argue with who's right and who's wrong good grief I've had enough of that we get enough of that during day the regular life we need to just focus on what God's doing what he's already done and what he's already give us an opportunity to do to me this is an opportunity for us to get one step closer to get out of here just one step closer to get out of here this is setting in motion things that we would have never thought like brother Dale said you can sit and try to figure things out and you think well this is gonna come this and this is going to come this way and then we'll all of a sudden here we got a little bitty bug that you can't even see and it's infecting people and it shut the whole world down not just as brother Lewis we were doing Wednesday night we did a little thing for the brothers overseas and he interpreted in Spanish because they wanted to kind of understand what was going on over here but the Bible says the whole world is groaning so now literally the whole world 151 countries are groaning and travailing waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of God just like the whole creation is the whole nature is you know you all the nature all there there groaning waiting on us to come back to that Adam and Eve condition as brother Dale was talking about this morning so god bless you we love you thank you for all the prayers just keep praying for us most of us still have our jobs and still going to work and doing what we're doing so we thank God for that and just pray the Lord's protection and what we're doing and and then you know if whatever this thing holds I pray that we'll get back to having church services again for that I enjoy it I know you at home miss it too but just create an atmosphere like brother man said you're a creator so right now an atmosphere that you're in a church service you know don't let the kids go running through the room and don't do it sit down and do just like you would prepare for service and I believe you'll get something out of it all right so we're still on journey a journey of a believer and I it's part five not part four so a brother Joe correct the meal nets and that's okay so it is part five on there I've still got it for a lamb but turn the Galatians three and I'm not going to make any announcements I don't know if we're going to be able to have the April the 18th for our Spring Fling get-together or for brother Dale's birthday dinner on April the 19th we'll just continue as we're going if they release us to do it we'll do it if not we'll postpone it so but other than that all the other we're gonna still look for the June maybe by then everything will be opened up and we'll still have our Father's Day fishing thing in June and be time for us to get out and that's brother Danny made me realize you can still go fishing and you can still there's really turkey seasons about all the sin but you can still go fishing the DNR told him they were still stalking the streams and you can still go to the lake and fish you know it's like I think me and him we're saying we talk about social distancing when I'm fishing I don't want nobody around me anyway back if it's a good hull right then it's me if it's a good hole I don't want you go find your six-foot somewhere else you know so but it you can't get out get out and enjoy go out in your yard I mean I'm enjoying my bees now so they're all going at it you know and pollinating everything and so we're you can make this situation what you want to make out of it you make it good bad or indifferent I want to make it good I want to make it worse a good thing that we can that we can do what we're doing so let's bow our heads and speak to the author before we read Galatians 3 the only father we thank you today for this opportunity that we have to come here and Lord to expound on your word father this is an eternal thing that we're looking at today before the foundation of the world Lord you wrote that Bible in in your mind and brother was talking about now that mine has come down to a group of individuals in the end time and it's a part of your eternal word father and that's what we are as Christians were part of the eternal Word of God so we asked you to sanctify Lord for this journey keep us safe keep this no virus away from us Lord and I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you would stay this thing Lord in and let it it's got to run a little bit of its course but as we were talking about Moses and Aaron Lord send the sensor down through the hospitals and send the healing angel Lord to heal these people look after the doctors and the poor nurses that are trying their best to do what they can Lord in just a new thing and where it's all unchartered water but we pray Lord that it wasn't a surprise to you you knew before the foundation of the world this was going to happen and you knew they would be a bride on the earth and you knew that she would cry out for help Lord and that you have ever-present help Lord in a time of trouble father we ask just to be with each one heal the sick bless the ones that are home Lord be with each one as we go about our daily lives Lord and made this thing come back to normal we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen so we're on a journey of a believer we've continued now through we're gonna hurry through justification and sanctification because even if you're watching in today and you're you're not a part of this church body then we believe that Abraham was our example God give us examples in the Bible to go by an Abraham was a perfect example of the journey of a believer alright he did not receive justification and sanctification in the baptism of Holy Ghost as we teach now but he was an example of that under the blood of bulls and goats he was under that anointing where he couldn't receive the new birth but he could be an example so that we as the seed of Abraham which we now have Christ inside of us that same person is going to go through that same journey all right so let's read Galatians 3:16 says now to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he says not in the seeds of of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ because really Isaac was not the promised son Jesus Christ was the promised son and then we're heirs of that promise and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dissin all in other words it didn't do anything to what God promised to Abraham it actually enhanced what he was doing to Abraham cannot disannulled that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise in other words brother Dale has an inheritance I'm his son so I get that inheritance automatically alright so if it be of the law then it's no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by a promise or by promise now let's read Hebrews 6 verse 13 through 15 for when God made promise to Abraham because you could swear by no greater he swear by himself in other words he said Abraham you know I'm gonna have anything to do with this Adam broke his covenant I made because it was a conditional covenant this is an unconditional covenant I'm going to make sure this takes place and when God makes sure it takes place that's got to take place because of the eternal okay but he's connecting himself as you'll see what brother Dale was talking about this morning he now has connected himself back to human beings where he can live in us not anoint Abraham or Abram to Abraham to do this thing he isn't he's now not just anointed us he's went in us being the seed of Abraham which is the faith seed of Abraham he swore by no greater so he knew it was going to be done all right so he swore by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured in other words Abram walked for 25 years as Abram with a promise but not the promise of having the promised son so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise and you may be seasoned or that his blessing to the reading of the word now we'll run through this real quick if you'll notice the property God tells us when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek because we're going to get to that today where Abraham has his name change he goes and meets Melchizedek and that's the type of what he's going to do for us in the end time he's going to connect back with us in the son of man because that was a man in human flesh that met Abraham all right so we'll get to that and brother Brahim tells us when abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final in if you realize what brother Dale is talking to us this is the way I see it God is not complete without you he had to give his attribute he had to give his attribute to you so he gave a piece of his self a piece of the puzzle a piece of the puzzle is now with you he had it all with him it was all right up here it was all in the beginning in the beginning was word words with God Word was God and that word was made flesh in Jesus Christ we know that but then it also was made flesh in me and you so the part of God you are it's like you're putting a puzzle together and men Jim's got old puzzles out we're putting puzzles together and all these things it's really it helps you mind especially when you get our age but when you can't find a piece of the puzzle the puzzles not complete you really don't see a hundred percent of the picture with pieces missing so God had to subdivide himself or divide himself out among the believers so that we can all come back together and then that piece of the puzzle is put back together so we had to be a part of God if we're born again you are a part of God you're an attribute as I said so every attribute is going to have to come to that he unfolds himself here what all the attributes that's menu will do it the final in every son of Abraham now that we're not ever son of Abram its son of Abraham will do in the final in every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing and like I said before we have faith in God we don't do stupid things like go out in the middle of the road back here and say okay god that next truck that comes down through here I'm just gonna melt right through it and you're gonna well you might melt through it but they may be a few days picking the pieces up okay but like I said before take that same situation though a kid run out in the middle of the road and you run out there and grab him and save him and God stops the car as we was telling them Sunday School class about June when there was a wreck upon money go mountains several years ago and and she was standing out in the middle the road with her hands up and the baby was right between her feet and the truck just I mean coming down that big ole Hill full of full of cargo it's in the heart not easy for them to stop and when they do put on their brakes they start fishtailing all that stuff well that thing stopped about ten feet from that baby so I believe that was God telling her to go out there because if not he would have he would have run right over the child so to me that's faith having faith for the time or faith for the moment so like I said again let's don't be let's don't be stupid let's do the things we're supposed to do and then let God lead us and guide us into all truth amen so we look at justification in Genesis 12 I told them we're not going to turn to that because we've been through it before but remember the Lord spoke to Abram in Chapter 12 for those of you that maybe are not familiar with this the walk of Christian takes three attributes or three ways of getting to God and one is justification because justification means he begins you on your journey and you become just are justified and all your child all your past sins are chopped off Abram is called in Genesis chapter 12 he says the Lord said unto Abram get thee out of that country so you're gonna have to separate that's where we we go with the Baptist and a different one so far as to say that once saved always save if you're truly saved to begin with a man because justification chops off your past sins but you still have a journey of sanctification where God will clean you out the Bible says in the Book of Luke that the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks in dry places so what ever you were doing before you're not gonna do that anymore if truly that spirit has gone out and then God puts his Holy Spirit in and then he doesn't just put his Holy Spirit in he seals the bottle and then he keeps all that goodness inside all right but I don't want to say once saved always saved and then it's kind of like a I was telling you the other day where this banker friend of mine you know we were out in the middle of the wait and he was drinking a beer and cursing and smoking a cigar and he said he just got saved and I said John what you get saved from what you say from I told him how I got saved we'll see I don't do those things anymore and it's not just do's and don'ts I have no desire to do that the desire has went away his desire wasn't gone away he might have come to a place of repentance and ask God to forgive him of his sins and he was sorry for what he did but why would you go back and do the same thing he had you asked forgiveness for and then you just keep doing it and you keep doing it I said John I said save means if you fall out of this boat and I reach and grab you you're drowning and put you back in the boat that's salvation but you're telling me that you went ahead and fell right back out of the boat again back into the same water now God's not that way he's not just gonna keep doing this amen so that's the same way with Abram Abram started on a journey in Genesis chapter 12 through justification which the Bible tells us that being justified freely Romans 3 verse 24 if you'll pull that one up being justified freely by His grace the problem is as we try to justify our self a lot of times I am justifying ourself we're not to just the fire he's the justifier the Lord Jesus is the just one and if we'll connect to him because look being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is not in us we receive Redemption but the redemption is in Christ Jesus whom God hath set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood it all based on faith to declare his righteousness not mine and yours you better not declare yours you could declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past listen I you can't pray and say Lord forgive me for what I'm gonna do tomorrow you ain't got there yet but God forgive me I know what I did in the past I know what I did yesterday I know what I did a few hours ago and God forgive me of that because remembers brother Dale's always told us grace is not for the future grace is for the past amen just what you did in the past so but when we still come to the place to where you know we like to take a little social drink or a little social chew or a little whatever you might have got you might have repented of it back then and got rid of and got rid of that part but the person that still made you do that is still in there so God's not going to reside do you understand what I'm talking about God's not going to reside in an unclean vessel so you're going to continually these things are going to sure we battle as human beings listening folks we bother you know that we Bible every day because what Satan wants to do he wants to get back into that vessel that he had control of before because he can't understand cuz he can't go through these processes that you and I go through he can't go through him because he's white he's not he can't be saved sorry but he can't he made that choice a long time ago but we can and he can't understand how we can say no no I know that's not part of me anymore so he can't get in that vessel anymore but if he's already in there he's just gonna keep doing what he did before and that was the same way with Abram as we looked and and keep that right there as we look in Genesis chapter 12 the Lord says alright Abram get up get out of your country in other words stop what you're doing and we won't I want you to walk in a different direction all right I don't want you to walk in the same direction so that's what I said about once saved always saved if you're still walking in the same direction you did I don't care if you made a confession or whatever you made several years ago what are you doing now because look god you're in a journey God is always moving you know that's why if you look at if you look at the Wailing Wall when people Adele's been there and I watch the documentary just a couple of days ago that's why they're doing this because they know God Jehovah even all through the Old Testament is a journey and God is always in motion so when they go to the Wailing Wall they're not just doing this for nothing they're doing this in reverence to God that God is in motion God is not still God is doing something so he that's why they do that at the Wailing Wall is that because God is moving so now we look at Abram Abram now God said get up and go get away from what you used to do but the problem with Abram is Abram as in our Christian journey to begin with starts making a lot of mistakes number one God told him to get up and move and what's the first thing he did he brought lot with him all right so that's like I said before he brought a lot and that's our problem we take a lot with us all right when we start our journey but listen as long as you're in that journey you'll start shedding those things as you go through your journey all right because Abram started shedding these things at one point he says all right light you go that way I'll go this or you go wherever you want to go I'll take the other way they're had there's somewhere in life like brothers like we were talking about you know you got friends that do what you do because you're of the same kindred spirit right but when you come to a place that you realize that God's working on you and he's not working on them at that moment there has to be a separation time because it's like water and oil they don't mix what you used to say they say okay beer yeah bar yeah let's go smoke yeah but now when you do the same identical thing and they say that to you and it has no hold on you at all and you go no I don't think I want to do that no and you keep repeating then somewhere down the line there's got to be a separation Abram and lot Abram had to separate from the lock that he took with him so you got to separate from the lot that you take with you your old baggage somewhere there's got to be a separation then jamming in Genesis somewhere in 1314 and there you see that Abram is walking and even lots walking with him and then all of a sudden Abram says stop we somewhere in here we got divided because we're getting - in other words like I always said you the herdsmen were the problem so Abraham's angels and lots demons were fighting each other same way with you that's what happens is God comes and gives you an anointing to carry you in through your journey because listen he knows you're gonna make it to the end you don't so if he knows you're gonna make it to the end the Bible says those who he has justified he has already glorified so your journey has already set as brother they will talk to us about in foreknowledge and predestination but the destiny is determined but you don't know we don't know tomorrow we don't know tonight but we know who holds tonight and we know who holds tomorrow and that's where we put our faith that's why Abram is going toward Abraham but that's the father of our faith he just got up and left he didn't have some great big you know and we have these clouds and we have all these signs Abram had zero zero sign and I believe brothers ask you had zero sign but they were some things happening things going on things that you couldn't stand anymore that used to be comfortable doing listen we've all been through that so same way with Abram God says hey Abel and get out of there Abram takes a lot with him but then all of a sudden God says okay there's gonna be a time when that Lots gotta separate from you well where did Locke go lot went to Sodom had a lot of problems and in justification you're going to have a lot of problems look to declare I say at this time his righteousness continued it's net you self-righteous people like us Dwight Moody said God will only fill those who not fold their self ok so self-righteous people are self-righteousness one that works is okay so anyway God's righteousness no if we take his righteousness and we envelop ourself in his righteousness because look that he might be just and the justifier of him which is us which believeth in Jesus is everybody got that same an all right so now let's go to Ezekiel 11 we're still in the justification where we're looking that justification is where God says I'm gonna use you but you're still dirty okay I'm gonna use you I'm gonna pick the jar up off out of the out of this cesspool that we were in all of us we're in there at one time God picks it up and you know what if God picks it up a lot of times they will justify herself we start going oh I think I'll do know God God went to Abram Abram didn't call God you didn't call him God sure you did sure you did but no it was God calling you it was something coming to you first to make you response so first God came to Abram and said Abram walk before me talk to me I'm gonna show you these things and I will make thee a great nation I will bless thee this is verse 2 of chapter 12 and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee so God is to me I like to look at like this god knows where we're gonna go in our life so he puts a little protective bubble around us he puts an anointing around us now it's probably it's the Holy Ghost because remember justification is a work of the Holy Ghost it's not the person of the Holy Ghost but he's working with you because remember he can't attach himself to something that's dirty we can't drink out of the glass wing when God first picks the glass up out of the sewer he's going to have a purpose for that glass but he's not going to fill it up and start drinking out of it right then neither are we banned in our natural life all right what are we going to do we're going to sanitize the jar right we're going to make sure it goes through a process to get rid of everything inside there because when we pour whatever we're going to pour in there we can't contaminate it and God's gonna pour himself in that vessel like I said before talk about the once saved always saved I agree with you if you truly got saved and God put his self inside of you change your desires and then he sealed it so Satan can't get in and God can't get out now the lid was off this thing brother Dale would be wet right but it's been sealed and that's what we're trying to get to if we'll get to it today I'll try not to go to ours again I'm sorry about last Sunday but it just felt good so we just kept on going and nobody fell asleep so we we the sleep the sleep your spirits may be home mmm anyway Ezekiel just say it Ezekiel 11 verse 17 God's telling us and I want you to see how God's working here therefore say thus saith the Lord God I will even gather you from the peoples season same over you or not he's get heat what'd he do he took Abram out of his country he took you in justification he took you away from not you're not sure earthly family mother father says and may have them but all of that family you were with because you know what just like now this is your church family you had a worldly family and then these are the people you used to run with we always call run with somebody you know she was running with this person well we were running from God at that time so now we're running with God in our journey so was Abram therefore thus saith the Lord God I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where you've been scattered in other words the world and I will give you the Land of Israel now we're talking about promised land our promised land and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things now look he's getting cleaning you up take all the detestable things therefore and all the abominations thereof from thence and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you now we're gonna get to that and I will take the Stoney heart out of your flesh and I will give them a heart of flesh you don't have a physical transplant by no means but God takes that old Stoney heart it just hates everything and talks about you know your Mama and Daddy and more you dated than your mama sometime but that's that old stony heart and God can't work with that why because it's set you've heard this the the saying it's set in stone well God don't want that he wants to make it pliable where he can use you and be the Potter and the clay be real pliable and then he can mold you into what he wants you to be and I will give them one heart so he's gonna give you a new heart what a new thought and you enter being a new enter direction is what he's going to give you that's what he gave Abram he gave Abram a new direction Abram was doing this everything was fine he was making idols with his daddy in the earth child easy I'd probably had a nice house and had everything going on and had probably had some social friends and then God just says you need to leave that place that's the same we spoke to us he spoke to our heart one dancing you need to leave the place not the physical place but the place that you're in you need to leave it because I want to deal with you I picked you up and I know I'm gonna use you now you're to the world you still look dirty and to you you still look dirty but to God those who is justified he's already glorified ain't that pretty that good clean water beautiful to drink I think I'll have a little right now mm-hmm so that's what he's done by knee in Ezekiel so that's Genesis 12 and chapter 13 he goes through many things chapter 14 then now chapter 15 they're not turning to it I told him not to we've been through it four four four services so if you want to though you can read it at home go to chapter 15 the Bible says after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram so what happens is is Abram God is not going to same thing in your journey Abram is not God is not going to just dump everything on top of you and say you got to know everything about this and that in the other you got to know how you're gonna be and you got to know how you react no God lets you walk through because he let Abram he'd give Abram the promise and he walked for 25 years before God his name to Abraham that was the promise to Abraham all right everybody got that he had to go through the journey of justification now we get into sanctification which begins in chapter 15 and we've seen sanctification chapter 15 that word is clean and set aside for service so he picks the jar up now he's going to use the jar but he's got to get it clean and we're not gonna take this water out here but there's just pretend there's nothing in it because there was old black muddy dirty water in there and then that ends in the Book of Luke it says the unclean spirit is going out so you pour all that out because God won't dwell in an unclean vessel and it's cleaned and set aside for service not put in service yet it would be horrible if I had this real pretty glass right here and there was nothing in it there's a purpose for that glass is to have really nice purified drinking water in it and man God won't Spira fied you a man and the only way to have purified you is to put purified him in you he's the perfection you're not but we're heading toward that direction Hebrews 2 verse 11 says for both he that sanctify and they who are sanctified are all of one you see how now God is moving closer to Abram because he's cleaning him and set in the side so now God can really touch the glass a lot better than he was probably doing like this you know when it was really dirty but remember in God's mind that's a part of him already okay and he has a purpose for that cleaned and set aside for service he's going to put this thing in service if you'll just continue what Abram just keep walking Abram went to Egypt Abram went to Canaan Abram Abram went to Iran he went to all these different plant what he kept moving he kept moving now a lot of times he got out of the will of God and he had to pay for it but so do wait all right and even but under sanctification you see that the Bible says after these things were one chapter 15 the word of the Lord came unto Abram in Division says fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward in other words I've come to a place to where I know you're sincere come see he's gonna check Abraham's sincerity over when he sacrificed Isaac his only son he's gonna check the sincerity of Abraham now he's checking the sincerity of Abram now he's checking your you say Hall is checking your sincerity he's not checking it for your purpose he's check I mean for his purpose he's checking it for your purpose he knew what Abram was gonna do before the foundation of the world Abram didn't know what he was gonna do but and what Abram did but look at this though in what Abram did God could use Abram and not John Henry or Joe or Jim or Tom or Ted or somebody out there you know God didn't just call Abram I believe he called a lot of people and they turned him down Abram was the only one that got up saying what with you why are you in a crowd of guys and all of a sudden God started picking on you well thank God because he knew what you would do he's not gonna cast his pearls before swine like he tells us not to and I hate to say this but he's not gonna waste his time knowing that somebody like Adolph Hitler he knew Adolph Hitler if you give him a million years of that's what I believe in the Lord knows if you're gonna accept him or not and if you're not ever gonna accept him sure God will bless you got a Lancer you pray especially for salvation but he'll know like people like that who you know they'll never do it so he don't have to give them anything because God can't give you something he can't give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost and take it away from you no no it can't Satan's an Indian giver God's not everybody got that so now in sanctification we see for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one watch he's coming together getting closer for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren start coming to church reading your Bible getting around a new group of people right you don't want to be around that old group of anymore be around the new group of people alright put you in or even in a we hate to say religion but it is a religious order that we come together as Baptists doing mess of the student Pentecostals and all the different ones we come together but says for which cause he's not ashamed to call them brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praises unto thee alright so now let's go to Ezekiel 36 the next one because watch what happens Abram goes through these many different things if you read chapter 15 and you'll see that Abram was told to bring some different animals in different sacrifice different things turtle doves and pigeons and Shi goats and a heifer and they all mean something but we we got to that last Sunday so we're not getting into it today I want to get on up a little bit closer to where Abraham meets Melchizedek but we see that God in other words what we're saying is is God even then I'll read from the unconditional covenant but a zekiel 36 verse 25 what for I will take you from among the heathen and remember and gather you out of all your country and bring you into your own land so he's Brett you got listen what is Redemption coming out of and going into so the Abram is showing the plan of redemption because he came out of the ur of Chaldees and he is now walking now sometimes he gets in the permissive will of God and he goes over to Egypt for a little while because it was a famine then you see him going right back to Canaan then right back to these different places you're gonna make a lot of mistakes but a lot of those mistakes are going to be taken care of in your journey in your walk all right because God takes the unclean spirit out now when he takes that unclean spirit out you don't have those desires anymore but remember though in the Book of Luke it tells us that it has unclean spirits only stays out for a little while he comes back and tries to get back in his house and he brings seven demons worse and tries to fill you up with a lot of religion go to church I still can't go to church but now you ain't got to pray all the time and you read your Bible while my goodness you don't need to do all that just goes Church or or whatever no that's not God that's the devil okay then I will sprinkle watch then I will sprinkle clean water upon you what he's washing you by the water of the word and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you what idols were the idols you had before the idols I had before the idols I don't have anymore Abram didn't have those idols anymore Abram was walking in a different direction than where he was in the error of child days everybody got that but now look he says a new heart also will I give you remember he took the stony heart out and give us a heart of flesh now watch he says and a new spirit well I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh so now he's gonna put a new spirit in you well the new spirit that he puts in you it's not the Holy Spirit now many may claim that it is but if you'll look and see what it it continues on we'll read Ezekiel a little bit later he says I'll put my spirit in you now that's the spirit of Almighty God I'll put my spirit in you but he gives you a new spirit to help you cope with the people because light like I was you know leaving the leaving the church and being gone for all those years I was comfortable out there I wasn't comfortable here you know mama would call me and Danny and she'd say it's Easter and it's Mother's Day and it's Christmas cuz you you know you see the people are part of the they call it the ENC crowd the eastern Christmas crowd they just show up because mama shames them enough to come well that doesn't do you any good at the inside guy might get a few passes on your head from your mom and your daddy but it still the inside guy still dirty you brought the dirty vessel in and until you got changed you took the dirty vessel back out because because you showed it once you got back out from under all this okay so I say to you that then he's going to give you then a new spirit that unclean spirit is gonna leave and God will give you a temporary spirit because it's not residing in but what he's doing is he's getting you ready he's doing some sanitizing work we all are in our hand sanitizer thing and all that Washington for 20 seconds well God's doing that by the washing of the water of the word I wish soap and water could do it it'd be too easy but soap and water can't get down inside you where it needs to be but God can God can get down in there and he can he can man he can he uses some kind of solution that we never heard of his human beings or we wouldn't have these problems on the outside hey man so it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost I wish we had it on the outside guy yeah but we got it on the inside guy and he's one that's one where it protects us cuz he sealed us whatever that liquid is it's inside of you it's sealed in there all right but what he does is he he from what up from what I gathered when I was in my journey coming up would be the same as this is that God is training you to take the Holy Spirit because God's not just gonna justify you and then you're unclean spirits gonna leave and then all of a sudden he's gonna fill you with His Holy Spirit that's not the way it works and you know what you and I couldn't take it that well I mean really we did if not listen if not there would only be two works of grace okay or one work of grace but God said there was three works of grace so we got to go through them three works of grace and once we do though there it is and then you look back on your journey and you say that's exactly the way my my journey went was justification I realized what God did I realized the day that God emptied me out and then started what he started buffing on you a little bit started buffing on you a little bit so that's what he's listening to what brother Brown says on number the unconditional covenant it would be number to watch close now then when he come down the Holy Spirit to talk to Abraham nay some about Abram here in the book of Genesis 15 let's go down the second paragraph and the next thing now what's going to do he's confirming and giving an evidence now look close he's given an evidence or a proof to Abraham how he's gonna do this right here he's giving an evidence or a proof to Abraham how he's gonna do it you and your natural journey with God you sitting here are you reading your Bible are you praying are you talking to the other brethren it puts you in an atmosphere to where God can talk to you and he might talk to you through a brother our sister our deacon our preacher or somebody he's going to talk to you through them maybe sometimes they even test you to see if you know you can take this spirit that he's fixing to give you because you come into a place that you never were before look what's God he's confirming and giving an evidence close he's given an evidence or proof to Abraham how he's going to do this and he's going to do it listen if you want to be healed how he's going to do this then Abraham I'm shutting you out of the picture remember in Genesis 15 if you read it he puts Abram to sleep in other words he says Abram you got nothing to do with this I'm doing the work I'm the Sanctifier I'm the justifier and if you'll just let me do the work let go and let God that's the whole thing let go and let God if you let go and let God I'm shutting you out of the picture I'm putting you to sleep because remember the old yous guys died somewhere in this journey it didn't happen in justification the old Abram didn't die the old you didn't died you were still that old sinner even in justification you still had that unclean spirit and clean water was inside of you at justification but as you walk the unclean spirit is driven I say spirits driven out the different things you used to do and then God is gonna say look because you know what if if you'll remember in your journey just think back there's a lot of things I tried to do that failed that I thought it might have been what God wanted me to do that's Abram heading to Egypt because what you see a little something going on here and you go home I'm gonna deal with that know these things you gotta deal with it God wants you to deal with it because he's fixing to put a new spirit inside of you to help you deal with it everybody got that same way it happened to mediate it like I said it's not just some no God says let me handle this that's what he was telling Abram let me even in sanctification because when he puts the Holy Spirit inside of you he doesn't clean you and set aside you for service he puts you in service so you've you've in other words you've had your your one year of training at 15 years old for you driver's license he's training you how to drive and then when you turn 16 and he gives you the Holy Spirit you know how to drive the truck I'd hate for brother Ryan to drove drove that big old truck he drives about 20 years ago or whenever you turn 16 ever how many years ago that was five years ago fourth it'd be a disaster even if even if somebody's like brothers like gets in that big old forty foot more than that 48 foot Peterbilt or whatever it is you got driver's license right but you ain't got truck driver's license that's what God's God's showing you exactly where your position is even in your sanctification you have nothing to do with this I'm going to train you I got to start what he's starting from nothing there's nothing inside here he's starting from nothing you're in our head hey man you're our head there's nothing there then he says Abram I'm shutting you out of the picture I'm putting you two sleep then before Abraham came a black sickness in other words every sinner deserves to go to hell blackness you ever thought about that even in your journey you thought about hey I could have went to hell if I had died I'd be gone so he makes you realize see it but God is not making you realize in a negative way he's making you realize in a positive way hey I brought you from that you're not gonna have to go there anymore like I said before thank God for the revelation that I have that I don't have to stand before the judgement if I go through justification how can I be how can I be judged if I'm justified already now see you don't realize that when you first get started see that would be self justification if you say oh I'm just as justice God yes he will prove you wrong simpler down the road but if you come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you see that you've walked in this journey you look back and you say man I am as justice God is because the Bible says the just and the justifier in other words it's the same person just like the Sanctifier and the sanctified is the same person cuz this what is God work it's it's God literally working on you in a personal relationship he didn't send a third person or a second person or a first person he's the only person that deals with you as the Holy Ghost which is God in another form same Lord Jesus Christ the comforter he said I'll send the comforter in my father's name will the father didn't have a name father in the name the Lord Jesus Christ is his name that's why we believe in one true and living God not three persons or personalities as I was explaining this morning me and Bob Bob don't like to hunt he wasn't set in a deer stand if you paid him $5,000 but well maybe now well you ain't paying $50 to sit in a deer stand well that's his personality everybody got that but now me and brother Danny we'd pay $50 for setting a deer stand if it was a good one if it was a it was a good spot but it's different personality so so God came three personalities in the Godhead as people say they are into Trinity he can't have three personalities they'd be different somewhere they would be a clash but if you look in the Bible and you look in Jesus is life there never was a clash between the Father the Son and there's never a clash the Holy Ghost doesn't all all of a sudden look back and say why'd you do that no it's the same person so they have the same personality they have different avenues that they reach you in just like I'm a father because I have a son back there called Josh but I'm also a son because there's my dad and if my grandbaby was here today I would be a grandfather to her but how many people am i one and there's no conflict because that's me and so I am same way that's how that we believe in one true and living God in Jesus Christ is his name the position that he took as fatherhood in the Old Testament this is the this is Jehovah God talking to Abraham or Abram right all right so that same person not another second person in the Godhead came to be the son that person in more feed our change this form into the son I and my father are one he lied he said I and my father one he didn't say we just agree on every once in a while he said well if you're the same person see I don't have to disagree in deer-hunting cuz I love it okay but if I separate myself into Bob like the the three persons of the Godhead would be somewhere in the transition Bob's not gonna like deer hunting and I am so there's a conflict there's not a conflict between three gods it's one God with three manifestations and he has one named Lord Jesus Christ that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to acts 2:38 and according to Matthew 28:19 that's what Jesus was saying baptized in my name the name of the Father father's not her name Sons on her name Holy Ghost is not a name it's positions of one person and if Jesus said I'll send the comforter in my name and I come in my father's name how many different names oh brother y'all way nice title as titles to a name Jehovah all these different things are titles to one name when he came on earth and took a human form to get us into this Kingdom he's talking about that's the Lord Jesus Christ and that's how we come I hope the whole family the Bible says his name Jesus Christ so why do I not want to identify I don't want to identify with the father they could billions of father there's billions of Suns there's billions of spirits but there was only one Lord Jesus Christ one not two or three there was only one Lord Jesus Christ and if all the family in heaven and earth is named after that then to identify myself when I go to the water to be baptized identify myself in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ go that's the family I'm fixing to go into alright they manage that alright I know we believe that but maybe somebody's watch maybe somebody I got a feeling that maybe somebody's watching in that had never watched it before so that's okay a lot of people sending home not doing much maybe they'll click on spoken word church you never know but God says look Abram I'm putting you to sleep every sinner deserves to go to hell blackness then after that of smoking burning furnace every sinner deserves Abraham that's what you deserve but beyond that one a little white light like I said before that little white light if you were spiritual enough which we weren't in our justification that little white light was right there with you the whole time there was an anointing there was a there was brother brown said we have angel to guide us new life that angels though it's not in here because it's not you didn't steer you into going to the bars and doing all the things you did but it was right here waiting on you to make a choice so what white light went between all that sacrifices watch but beyond that when a little white light that little white light went right between those pieces of sacrifice right back and forth the white light moving showing making a confirmation showing Abraham what he would do someday through his seed Isaac bringing on Christ for the supreme sacrifice so that little white light they followed you all your life that you really a lot of times ignored but it was there but there's a time when it comes where it gets closer and your walk of sanctification it got closer because Abram in this dream or vision he sees this white light and it goes down through the sacrifices where now as we continue on through our journey that white light disappears but it doesn't go away from you it goes in you just like this right here it goes inside of you so now that thing that that that watched over you all that time is now inside of you all right and we see that as a confirmation when we keep reading about the seal of circumcision that Abram comes to and gets his name changed because you know what as we walk through life you and I walk through life we were called sinner I don't care what your name was you were sinner you were Abram you were walking through life not know no rudder no you know I mean you had the boat you had the water you had ever the sails but you know what without a rudder without that little thing in the back that little guide to turn you the wind can take you over here and take you over here but when you got that spiritual rudder called the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll lead you and guide you into all truth doesn't matter if the winds blowing in that direction you can take a hard rudder and you can go right straight into that wind if you've got that rudder all right everybody got that same man and then now look let's go to number three then hitting life in Christ and I'd like to stop here possible and tell you something on that you're a little Creator yourself cuz watch he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit is it God's Spirit that's your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll put my spirit in him but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in he had to send Abram into a vision that Abram has nothing to do with this all these animals laying here and and like I said before Abram was awake when the sacrifices were made and he kept he kept the files away all them foul spirits that keeps trying to come back he's shoeing the files away but then God finally puts him to sleep says look Abram quit fighting let me take care of it because where there's a white light then fouls will leave when there's when there's good fresh meat to eat the fowls will leave all them foul spirits that used to be inside of here God's telling you fight them off because listen it's a fight you know that I know we all know that it's a fight when you first start in your Christian journey why because Satan is right here he wants you back man he wants you back you're his best soldier you've served me for 20-something years what's your problem and he gets mad but God don't get mad God's just going to okay do what you need to do and you come right Abram you need to come right back to Canaan until that's where I'm gonna bless you at you need to come back to the promised land remember my promise that's why brother Branham will tell us and you can see and we're gonna read it maybe mm-hmm where when we get over to when Paul starts talking about Abram said he staggered not at the promise of God and that's what he's gonna say to you thank me all the people that went away from the warden and then came back he's not gonna say what took you so long cuz he knew how long insane to start with but he's gonna say thank God my child you heeded the call and your mind I don't care if it took you 20 years I don't care what you did cuz remember once you come to justification the you ask God to chop off your past sins I don't care if you were an axe murderer whoremonger whatever you were God said I'll forgive you of your past if you'll let me justify you and you not justify yourself I did that because see that's justifying yourself that's why he's showing Abram all this look Abram you're gonna do this all you got to do is have faith that's why he's a face see debate were the face seat of Abraham that's why Abram to Abraham to even having the promised son God looked at him as if he did none of that wrong because he's gonna look at you how is he going to who can weigh the charge to God's elect it's God that justifies a man like I said before whoever if anybody ever brings you your past up and it's bad it ain't God God can't do that you said well God can do anything no God can't remember what he put in the sea of God forgetfulness he cannot remember that so he has to get you fixed up but first before he can come in what he's got that he's got that stony heart out he's got the heart of flesh now he's took that old nasty spirit out and give you a small gentler spirit so you can deal with yourself I'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so you can entertain him right who did we entertain before all this started the devil and we can't have the devil and God in there at the same time and then those God won't dwell an unclean vessel but we had come through this journey that we're coming through look at verse number 4 the Intervale notice you put a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you couldn't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you and that's true how many times have we walked even when we coming towards not sanctification and them demons that keep coming back and the old flesh part of you and the old Adamic nature is still there and it's trying to lean back that way but you have to let go of the and let God as he did with Abram put you completely out of it because the old you will go back to it but if you'll just say I'm empty I'm empty guard are you going out to fill me up because I can't deal with this well that's what he's doing he's giving you a new spirit so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit I will put a new spirit in them and I will put my spirit in them he said after he's give you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not that's why I say to people that think once saved always saved you might have got a new spirit but it wasn't the Holy Spirit you got a new spirit to try to be a little more religious and Satan is the most religious person in the world besides God himself amen but you got to let die and let God take over and then he'll put the right spirit he'll put the right water in here all right don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you and he will give it to you if you'll ask him all right so that's why we're coming now to Genesis chapter 17 if they want to pull that up we'll probably get 17 and 18 not going to get to adoption like we were thinking about doing but that's okay we got next week we can handle so let's read it for a minute let's see now when Abram was 99 years old it's never too late it's never too late the problem was and the problem that was back in sanctification that we didn't cover is God told Abram you're gonna have a promise son but he never told him exactly how it was going to happen so Abram goes over in permissive will and says hey I can still perform in other words you understand what I'm saying and and me and Sarah never could have any kids so Sarah says okay take this Hagar woman see that was his idea they're all idea and it was part of the plan yeah sure guarding you about it but that wasn't God's promise because look God knew that the promised son had baton be between Abraham and Sarah not Abram and Sarah or Abram and Hagar and even when Sarah went down to Egypt or wherever they went and he was going to give her away God protected her because if that King would have took her his wife you understand what I'm saying it would have polluted what God said was going to happen he said you know you're gonna have that promise son but then when he comes to Abraham when we get into here right here he's gonna say okay now you're gonna take a name change Sarah contentious woman is going to now be a prince and you're gonna have it with Sarah and your ninety-nine years old at seventy five they might have had a chance now that's what God wants you to do every one of us he wants us lucky just like I just said in Genesis 15 we can't make God give us the whole ego but he will give it to those that are of an honest in the contrite heart the ones that lot will take it and have went through these three steps you got to go through those steps cuz Abram was the father of our faith if he had to go through it in a natural life you and I have to go to the same thing in a spiritual life everybody got that right and when Abram was ninety years old and nine he has quit trying to figure out he can have kids he's done he's gold his body's finished and he knew Sarah or Sarah he'd lived with her since they were 16 years old and they couldn't have kids to start with but he knew he could perform because he had a child with Hagar so he comes got this thing a little figured out but it ain't what God said kind of like we all do but the best thing to do is this watch stay in the word stay in the journey stay connected stay hooked up with church they hooked up with the Bible statehood up with listen to the prophets message stay hooked up with listening to live ministers somebody that can look you in the face that's why this is we are sheep we are herd animals we have to be led alright and when Abram was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect he never said that daivam before because you knew Abram couldn't do it but now he's getting ready to bring him into the new birth and you say well then you know I can't first thing you tell people stuff like that and then especially people out in the world and they're not us is message believers cuz we've been taught different they just haven't been taught well they ain't nobody perfect you ain't perfect night perfect I'm not trying to be perfect but if I got the perfect guy inside of me he says I'm perfect I make human mistakes but he's telling Abram look walk before me and be thou perfect in other words I've sanctified you I'm getting ready to put you in service but I you're not perfect until you come to this new birth until you come to the filling and the sealing you're not going to be perfect but God says what before me and be thou perfect and I will make my covenant between me and thee and I will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee nobody else thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations now remember Abram meant hi father but Abraham literally means father of many nations so he's telling him right now he's gonna change his name right here because literally Abraham means a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called sinner but thy name shall be Christian got it that's what he's saying he walked all them times as Abram now he's taking the name change and if that was me and you that would be the point we would go to the water and we'd be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and become a part of that family of God be connected by look Abram thy name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be called Abraham thy name shall be mrs. Lord Jesus Christ all right not mrs. father son Holy Ghost that could be many fathers many sons many spirits but one the Lord Jesus Christ for a father of many nations have I made these 9 name shall be Abraham and I will make thee look at this i wills gut still in control here and I will make the exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my covenant between me and thee because Abraham didn't have a covenant he didn't make it God made it and Abraham come under that covenant you and I are under the that covenant now the seed of Abraham because look and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a God unto them and to thy seed after thee and I will here's I will I will I will in other words you can interpret that as I am the I am is on the scene the I am will give unto thee into thy seed after the the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan the promised land for an everlasting possession and I will be their God you see what he's making he's making that Abrahamic covenant of land grant because what does he give the seed of Abraham you and I are the seed of Abraham what's our possession after all this is said and done after all the sins done away with after all the sinners are already been sitting where they need to be sent after everything is all back up right again where do we get to go right here right here this is our possession as a seed of Abraham Abraham for an everlasting possession all the land the land where you are water pill I'm a pilgrim and a stranger right you know why strange because they're strange up there they think we're strange because we do all these weird things well guess what if God says they do strange things and we don't then I'm gonna tell you what God said God says we're a pilgrim and a stranger to them out there but he's given this land a land grant and God said unto Abraham now Abraham Christian now I'm I'm putting a lot of weight I'm putting a lot of things on you now because you're gonna have to do something you're gonna have to accept this you gotta accept it and God said unto Abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised now that was a listen that's a type of the Holy Ghost but remember the Holy Ghost couldn't get into the believer in didn't Old Testament because the blood of bulls and goats covered their sin and and and waiting for Jesus Christ to die on the cross so he can release that life to come back inside that person everybody got that okay so this is a this is now it doesn't matter if you're physically circumcised or not it has no bearing whatsoever and Paul covers that in the New Testament he says circumcise Duncan circumcise he said it's a circumcision of the heart but to show a natural sign that you and I are supposed to show a natural sign as being a believer he'd give them a seal of circumcision I thought the other day listen to this this is really good I like this this God help me come up with this God came up with it and I just listened but you know what that is that's a secret sign it's in the private parts but it can be shown it starts in the private part the stillness of your heart one day you said God I want you in here I don't want you covering me here I want you inside here and it's a secret brother Brian said what is an individual affair with God but he was showing this to Abram why didn't he say well now we're gonna just you know maybe cut off your earlobe or or you know why do you have to be what it were it was it was in a private place and that's where God gives you the new birth in a private place but in that private place what they could do in the Old Testament if you met somebody and they were all dressed like a I say an Arab not meaning anything against that but dressed the part you're dressed apart they don't know if they're kindred or not they don't look alike but you can go take him in a secret place and you could physically show them that you were under that covenant and that you were circumcised so you were in this faith of Abraham or you weren't by the physical you understand what I'm saying by the physical looking but it was a seek you had to be in a secret part we're worried it's not just anybody and everybody know it was a secret thing and that's what he done with with this and I kind of like that because it is it's a secret affair with goddess but then though you can show it outwardly if anybody needs to know all you got to do is and say I'm under now the seal of circumcision you don't have to show them your whole flesh shows it same same hand that held the beer now holds the Bible God just cleaned it up and put it in service he didn't rip your tongue out because you cursed like a sailor no he just changed to what the inside part the private part he changed it and when he did then you can show it outwardly even in your natural flesh oh I love that this is my coven which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed every man child among you shall be circumcised and they shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin showing that it was excess skin that didn't have any I guess you might say didn't have any value that's what they're saying but same way what did we have to do like what we have to do we had to cut off the old skin of the worldly stuff that we used to do not not physically just for the people on wine not physically but spiritually that old what give you the biggest problem it wasn't really your flesh it was the motivator inside but once you got a new motivator inside it changed your flesh you didn't have any excess demons running around if I got that and there's another thing you can say about this but I'm not gonna say here but it's an actually a showing it's just showing who you are she's showing what you've done it's actually a sacrifice Abraham was 99 years old and he did it to himself because it was this natural sign to show that then Abraham did have to believe enough in God now listen everybody listening God wasn't standing in human flesh yet he was only speaking to Abraham and he's tells Abraham you got to go take and they didn't have surgical tools back then you see what the sacrifice you finally had to make he had then see Abraham believed that what he was doing was what God told him to do not what just some man or some voice out somewhere told him to do no he believed at that point of his life he looked and said well I'm not gonna be able many more I'm gonna be Abraham something's changed I've got something and now I can do something God tells me to do this and it's a it's a horrible thing it's gonna hurt it's gonna hurt I love my old friends but it's gonna hurt when God puts his self down inside here and then he takes that top and he seals that thing in or he takes a ceiling it's gonna hurt but it's gonna be what God says to do that seal of circumcision and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant between me and thee now see that covenant was not an eternal covenant it was an everlasting covenant it stayed until because remember even Jesus was circumcised remember the Bible tells us remember Mary was in the line to go have Jesus circumcised on the eighth day because that's what they told him to do because that they were he's part of Abraham's lineage seed not not total lineage but anyway that's where Simeon mater was in that line and she was going to be circumcised and she had the two turtledoves as she took brother Brown explains that very well but look and he that is eight days old now watch it for those of you that don't know online and for those of you that do we're gonna refresh seven days is old creation right seven days God created the world in seven days there are seven church ages there are seven spirits of God there are seven different things which means completion in the Bible but when you come to an eighth day and you use that eight and they even turn it around flat to make it show eternity because there's no ending to it so we know that that we are we we as born-again believers are circumcised on the eighth day which puts us into the eternity when you're born again when you're boarding in the day you're born again bro is that you're just as eternal as God is you're just as eternal as God ever was and ever will be and man so you're in an eighth day so see he shows a type that he that is eight days old why'd he say four three six wine even say seven he said on the eighth day you've come into a holy convocation with God as we see there in Leviticus it talks about an eighth day seven days you'll do these things and on the eighth day now remember there's no eighth day for those of you there online there's no eighth day it's just that's the first day again it's a continual one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven but when you enter into that next cycle man cycle is seven God cycle has to recycle again because it's eternity so the eighth day is just the first day over again everybody got that right so you not we now are in an eternal loop everybody's born again you're in an eternal loop that's brother Dale's talking about the mind of Christ that is the eternal loop because your old Adamic nature of mind we're gonna live we're gonna have problems and we're gonna die that's why we've been taught since we were babies because we'd go to funerals we'd go out and see this but when you get the mind of Christ that puts you in an eternal part there's an eternal part now of you that can never die a man that can never die so you're in an eight-day holy convocation that the world knows nothing about all right excuse me and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you and every man child in your generations he that is born in a house are bought with money of a stranger which is nothing seed he is born in the house he that is bought with money much needs to be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh because remember he could only anoint the flesh of those people he couldn't go down inside to get in their soul to make that the new birth but it is an absolute type of the new birth now since Jesus Christ went to the cross and gave his flesh release the life the eternal life that was in him he released that like Bill adele's talking about that mind of Christ that the part of God that sure to play I'm gonna say this but it's not with God anymore it's you and God because you were back in him before the foundation of the world in a thought or an attribute now you've been brother Brahm tells us in in hood in Melchizedek he said now you've been displayed you're not up here anymore you've been displayed but according to matching pieces of brother Dale preached in 1995 that piece though that piece of the puzzle that's gone has got to reconnect to make it the fullness of the Godhead bodily the fullness is the bride pieces coming back together to this one place because remember if if you were eternal back then you're eternal now the attribute became to you the only way we could get here though whispers is because of the sex act that happened in the garden that caused fall between Satan and the Beast the man so we came a little different way by permissive well this did but the eternal was always eternal and if he knew you accept it in two thousand nineteen or twenty whatever it was it was right there he didn't go away but when you received it where to go it went to you so now you're a piece of the puzzle that God don't have in the dimension he's in now you're in this dimension but you're going to connect back to him in that dimension that's why we all have to go away the bride has to go away with the bridegroom to the wedding supper and then with what we do we connect all back together if I got that we're not gods not leaving any pieces down here once we take a rapture all the pieces go right back to where it started from amen we just took this with us to show the devil that God can live in human flesh and be perfect because God said walk before me and be thou perfect all right hey BAE okay with that all right mm-hmm my covenant shall be for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of the foreskin is not circumcised I was now what happened was is if you were in a crowd and mingling around and you wanted to go in the temple remember they have that problem in the New Testament one of them Timothy or one of them wasn't circumcised because you had to show yourself you had to unveil you had to unveil yourself before the man and if you weren't circumcised in the New Testament one of them got in trouble or Peter because he took somebody in there that wasn't certain they thought so much of that that was a literal thing that they held on because look I told him to under the Old Testament God told them that's what you get to do in other words that sure new birth to show people that you have separated yourself from the Gentiles because Gentiles didn't care all right and the uncircumcised man child his flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant that's what happened to me and you when we came by the sex act between mom and dad which was allowed by God right it was allowed by God but he got you here so that you can display the Covenant that God now is living in my circumsized inside not outside inside my circumcise the inside and now I can show the world through this flesh that God can live in a human body and be perfect regardless whether you believe that or not I believe that if he told Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect and then Jesus tells us in the New Testament be therefore perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect and God said unto Abraham ask for Sarah thy wife we're gonna stop right here we didn't even get to chapter 18 we will start with chapter 18 next week because remember somewhere along the line you're gonna meet God in human flesh and you're gonna realize it's God talking to you and man doesn't matter if it's this man this man this man this man this man who you're gonna meet God in human flesh and that person is going to bring you a direct message and you're gonna understand more than you've ever understood before brother Lewis he'll tell you that you don't mind me telling that he didn't think he had the new birth before he came to this church but when he came to this church he got the new birth by listening to God in human flesh is that okay I hope we all realize that I hope we all come to realization that God you spoke to me and then everybody there's not a person in this building but you and that's who God was speaking to directly that day and then maybe it's not Louis's day anymore he's had his day he's had a circumcision you don't go reser kamsani same one here once and done but you got to be circumcised but next time it was bozek's time or other rinds or any of us it was our time what did God come to us and said look circumcised think of that you're gonna you know what you gonna do remember I told you last week when you get circumcised that ninety years old see we were all circumcised as babies so really didn't even you know not rly you understand what I mean but if you would waited til something I've talked to a few this waited too late thirty years old and because of medical reasons they had to be circumcised wasn't fun so the longer you wait the worse it is everybody get born again real early I wish not and a hope for the young kids that we that that happens if God can get to you first and you go through that circumcision but what happens is is you walk different a physical male when these circumcised at that age he physically walks different well that's what God's telling them say look you're gonna walk different you're gonna walk you're gonna be light like I said with a Jacob Jacob had a name change to Israel but he had to fight with an angel the angel had to smite him on the thigh and then he became the limping Prince so everybody that knew the world knew Jacob this was Jacob but now everybody that knew Israel after that that he had been with God oh he walks different and that's exactly what they say right let's say they tell us how you've walked different why you've been circumcised and God said unto Abram Abraham as for Sarai thy contentious wife the one that gave you Hagar and the one that won't you know that you know I can't do this so I'm gonna give it to somebody else you shall not call her Sarah anymore but Sarah princess shall her name be and I will bless her now he's never said that before never has he said anything about even Sarah he was Abram Abram Abram but now that Abraham's name's changed to Abraham he needs a bride with the name change amen and he said unto Abraham for Sarah thy wife that contentious old person we used to be contentious everything was contentious right but now you're gonna be Sarah and you're gonna get the blessing now look and I will bless her and give the son also of her Abraham I'm giving you the whole plan of redemption right here you and this woman Sarah are going to have that promise I gave you 25 years ago and I will bless her and give thee a son after her yea I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations kings of people shall be of her then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed now look this is like I said before you know you you first get born again you remember you've just been circumcised so it hurts a little bit so Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and sitting this in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old shelf Sarah there's none here sieze he's back to circumstances again but he turns everything back around because Abraham sending all that instrument may live before the ash boy ain't got nothing to do with it it smells out of the picture now Ishmael gets a blessing but it ain't too blessed it's not the blessing that Abraham and Sarah is gonna bring to the world which is Jesus Christ we know that right and Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael may live before then God said look did he say no Abraham no Abraham that's not what he just not didn't even pay attention to what he said same way with God remember gods knows of the best yeses we ever gets a lot of times but God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac so Ishmael is out of the picture now and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for Ishmael I've heard thee behold I have blessed him he's going to bless the foolish virgin he's gonna bless the people of be giving eternal life they're a part of the plan they're actually a part of the mind of God but not to part you an hour they're part of the thinking of God not a part of the mind of Christ okay thereby okay with that behold I blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve Prince's shall he beget and I will make him a great nation but but my covenant will be with Isaac which Sarah shall Behrend early at the set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and God went up from Abraham Abraham took Ishmael and all that was born in his house and all that was bought with his money every male among the men of Abraham's house and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day he didn't wait two weeks he didn't wait two months that day God told him that's the day he did it same way with you and I don't lollygag around if God's getting ready to give you something take it there likes do like Mary and say be it unto me Lord according to thy word I'll take it give it to me and smell his son was 13 years old women and Abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin and Ishmael his son was 13 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin so you see in a type there's Ishmael the Ishmaelite group that we think so bad and rotten which they are contentious and they do fight and they are going to but remember they come under the same covenant they receive circumcision now not here on earth I'm throwing spiritual now not here on earth you and I have received circumcision by the new birth now they get circumcision at the white zone judgment basically if you if you call circumcision the new birth they won't get the new birth and you birth is you were born a human you come to a new birth you must be born again on this earth and either you die or we take a body change and go in the rapture now they are born not Ishmael live Ishmael all through their life but at the very end they're circumcised are given the Holy Ghost not a new birth because a new birth means they were born and then they got a new birth see that's what's special I hope y'all see this if you don't see anything else the new birth is the most special thing because you were once dead in your natural life walking through the earth thinking you the most of a lot of people in the world you just didn't get ready to come but you're not you're dead is a hammer right inside but God thought enough of you to bring you Abram through Abram into Canaan all the mistakes you make all the things that happen in your life God is leading you and then he births you a new he rebirths you not like not like who was it I gotta go back get my mother's won't see he was talking natural Jesus said no you gotta be born from above well then well then he should have said he should have said well where's that no he just didn't understand it but you and I understand that we are born from above and then when God gives us the new birth that makes us a new creature that makes us sons and daughters of God the bride of Jesus Christ and all these different things but Ishmael is going to be circumcised but he's got there people that people the foolish virgin a cup of water my name people are given eternal life they were born and never got a rebirth they never were born again so they go through life and they die and they have to come up with white throne judgment but what they have to do is is they have to give an account of what they did you and I never have to do that if you're born again today that old circumcision remember that circumcision you don't ever get circumcised again and man god never accounts that back to you backwards but to Ishmael and hid the Ishmael group they have to come up and God has to give them eternal life now it's the same eternal life we get but we get it here that's the difference we get it right here on this godforsaken covin 19 earth that we're living in but they're gonna have to wait go through a judgment stand at the white throne judgment and be given eternal life the Bible says the books were open and they were judged by their own works I don't will be judged by my works I want to be judged by the works at Calvary where God took my place and God's the one that said to me walk before me and be thou perfect I want to be circumcised in that secret place but I want to be able to show the world that something happened that I walked different and that in chapter 18 the Lord is finally going to not just talk to Abram not talk to Abraham he's going to appear before a man so let's stand to our feet god bless you hope you enjoyed that I enjoy I'm kind of like brother Jimmy Gibson if you can't talk about nobody talking about Abraham you can't go wrong when you start talking when you start talking about you need this that when you start talking about Abraham you can't go wrong because you know what you are there faith seed not natural seed you're the faith seed of Abraham cuz in all this right here now sure it may look like to the natural world that tells us a lot of things he didn't believe but what happened he kept walking he kept going through the things in life he kept going through him and he went through them it's going through a problem it's what gets you out on the other side going through something gives you the victory if you stop and say I'm done I can't do this no more that's not a victory you've stopped walking now God just keeps on going and somebody's gonna come right there with him let it be me and you let's sing a song sing I think God for the lighthouse it's 348 in spiral 348 mm-hmm 348 my life to here [Music] Jesus is the light paths and from the rocks of said he has shown his light around me that I could clearly see that if it wasn't for that Lila tell me where would she be for the light I owe my life to Him well I have some strategy you can depend on it says the lighthouse and from the rocks of Sydney has shone his light around me that I could clearly see if it wasn't for that Lila tell me where were delicious feed thank God for the White House thank you today was Ohio my life beauty before Jesus is I like and from the rocks of Sydney has shown his line around me I could clearly see that if it wasn't for that lighthouse little me where would this ship see a man he's shown his lot he's given us how in the world we are known Abram and Abraham if it hadn't have been for a prophet God sitting in time that that was an example now we can take examples of Abraham of being faithful and all being all these different things but for to put it and were when you read it in the Bible that you put your own personal spiritual experience through what happened with Abram when you were just a sinner out in the world listen you were a sinner that was your name you weren't you know you you were rying the center I was weighed the center now by the new birth by being reborn now it's the same Ryan I see but now it's riding the Christian and the whole world can see that the each one of us have had a name change everybody wants to talk about name changes why we already got one we went from Abram to Abraham I mean we already had a name change according to the Bible we went from Abram to Abraham we went from Center to Christian we're mrs. Lord Jesus Christ we are accepted into the family we are the bride we all will have an intimate mate that we can be with called the Lord Jesus Christ so thank God for the lighthouse and thank God for y'all being here today I want to say those of you that are at home Lord bless you I wish everybody could come but if we're all get together and pray they got to stay this thing and that that as they did in the Old Testament that that as of right now the the Spirit of God is going out and and stay in this thing and keeping it down too minimum so that we can all get back at least have a little semblance of life even though this may be heading toward the end who knows I mean this is not the apocalypse now we know that because we're not even folks to be here so I mean I thank God for that even you know you'd you look in the denominational world they tell you you got to go through tribulation period well my Bible don't say that I don't know if I'd want to listen something like that to tell me I got to go through now sure we go through little things that we got to go through but I'm talking about when the tribulation hits that's the wrath of God this is not the wrath of God this is because sinners because we're sin laden in our body okay if we'll understand that it's what happens to a it's a virus it's it's a virus it's something that started somewhere and then it keeps going from human being to human being well you know what I want a virus I do I want to be infected with the whole ego and being in fact it makes me affected and may make us effective in this world - what I'm saying is let's pray for those people out there let's not condemn this one in that one any other can't stand anybody condemned and I don't care if it's a filt this guy on the face of the earth if he's in that position it's like brother Dale said you honor that position I don't want to hear no bashing of Trump or whoever you want to talk about I really don't care but he's doing the best he can as a human being and they ain't nobody in that position for him and you you want to put yourself in it I don't know not at this moment I don't but I see because all this world is not ours we let them run the cosmos our world order and let them but you know what brother I'm never said he said don't pray for America he never said don't pray for the leaders or the leadership he even stopped the service one time and prayed for Dwight Eisenhower because they told him he had a stroke or heart attack and they were taken to a hospital he stopped the service and he said you pray for those people the Bible tells you to pray for Kings pray for those who have the rule over you if you condemn them I am I doubt to experiences the Christian I really do because that's being totally selfish but this is the crisis that we and help your neighbor help your neighbor in this in this thing help you know do do the best you can what you got Jim had a bunch of cloth that was she had put up somebody give her just bolts and bolts of cloth I think it was math maybe Matthews Wow anyway she had all that and they were getting there making surgical masks so she's sending it to Gainesville so they could make some surgical math do what you can don't just sit back and say no God just protect me and my for no more well you know what if you're that way you're selfish and with toilet paper now be careful with the toilet paper don't hoard it okay but if you need some go bite I think everything will be okay after a while but we're just gonna pray that that's what God's gonna do he's gonna he said he'd never leave us never forsake us he'd do he what he takes care of his kids first never brother mom said one time he said you know all of heaven is praising God and the angels are shouting and everything's going on and all of a sudden God says shut up I hear one of my children needs need something hole heaven hush just because one person hit their knees and said father I need something from you that's how important you an hour we're not important in ourself God's made us important a man so we need to believe that and go forward not do anything stupid you're not doing anything foolish don't tempt God the Bible says so we're not going to tempt God but let's do the best we can with what we got I pray to God that somebody will come up with a vaccine or some person will be anointed to go up here to that hospital and just lay hands on the sick and they all recover I truly believe that God can do that and I'm praying that somebody will get desperate enough that will will stay this thing and it won't get its work any worse than it is and we'll get back to our some part of our life like I said the world's doing the best they can they're running on fumes now they're everybody's running on fumes up every nation is like us they just the United States broke everybody's broke but this is where we know that who is going to come up with the gold that that's sitting on the gold over there and think of it that's the worst place is hitting now but they're sitting on the gold of the world and all they're gonna do is say okay if you'll do this it's kind of like I'm gonna say this one time that the bill they passed the Democrats had all kind of little jump they put in that bill when then Clinton coming close Clinton excuse me Trump looks at him and says what we got to do you know it's give-and-take and it all it is it's giving takee it's not it's not cut and dry you had to give them a little bit you know a little bit of compromise well listen God don't compromise but all that compromising is putting stuff attached to those bills and they're passing them and like brother Dale has always said they're gonna lay there on those books until they need them and then when they need them they're gonna say oh remember back in 2020 we passed that one trillion dollar well we also put in there that y'all can't even have Church anymore you can't assemble unless you unless you have a sign of a Catholic Church you know you understand what I'm saying because they take over and they say this is what you got to do we own you now it's not China we thought won't try to own this one I don't know if China owns us now or not I think it's the strings are being pulled from other places but we know that we read the news we know that's what's gonna happen so just realize that we're heading toward the end time we're closer than we ever have been it's obvious tomorrow we can say we closer than later for Ben okay but we see the things happening to put in place that we would think like brother Dale he'd sit down and try to think then you go man one little virus we shut this shut the whole world down one little virus has shut the whole world down for this moment of time what else can happen but I promise you the bride of Jesus Christ will prevail because we got a covenant now an eternal covenant which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't work under temporary covenants the Covenant with me and you was made back before the foundation of the world and it can't can't ever fail you remember that online it God can never fail and if you got God inside of you you can't fail either let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father thank you for this day thank you for the opportunity we have Lord to speak to your purchase possession Lord we pray that what we've said has been pleasing to you Lord and it will help us all to grow a little bit closer to you father we do pray and you know in our heart you the Prophet said he you know our heart our heart is set on Lord that something will happen to stay this thing Lord or they'll find a vaccine or they'll find something Lord to stop this because human beings are dying human beings are dying they're crying out for help and they don't know who to cry to Lord I pray that you'll be their comforter Lord in the time of trouble then I think about all the different ones that are that are passing away in the different hospitals and not even have family members around them they're just dying alone father what a horrible thing of dying but to be to die alone but Lord we know as Christians we don't die alone we have you there with us and that you'll protect us and lead us and guide us and Lord truly protect us here protect some of the older ones brother Dale and all the different ones that that are older and more susceptible to these things Lord we ask you to give them a another angel to super protect them and keep them strong because we need everybody here Lord thank you for the ones that are here thank you for the ones that are online Lord we pray that you just give them supernatural strength for this week coming up or we ask these things in Jesus name we all say Amen god bless you brother Aaron will be here Wednesday night so thank you for coming and we'll be swapping a few out and around about some of the different ones and god bless you thank you for your time and thank you for your patience the man god bless you
