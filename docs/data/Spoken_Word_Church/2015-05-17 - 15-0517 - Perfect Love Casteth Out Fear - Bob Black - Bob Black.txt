========================================

well I get it from you all right all right good morning everyone congratulations I'm a little reading from John because he uh yeah is that that eagle that really had an understanding of who Jesus was and Who We Are before we get into this little scripture first John 4 18 let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we thank you Lord Jesus for the word that you've given unto us and for the understanding that John was just speaking of Lord God thank you God because that you called us Lord Jesus to be Believers to receive this word that you've given unto us Lord I pray God that you'll bless this little Sunday school lesson this morning Lord and bless the believer in the service this morning Lord that you'll open our hearts to hear you Lord Jesus and to receive something that we can be strengthened by and bless the ones that couldn't be with us this morning or it's interesting to help all the sick of the foot doing great believing Lord that you're still the same yesterday and today and forever will you asking your name big man now I I've been meditating on this little scripture for a while because now let's let's read this real real slow and careful so that we get the meat of it there is no fear in love with perfect love casteth out fear because fear has 20. he that feareth is not made perfect and love amen so you say well what do you fear now fear now we've been talking about communion all this time and brother Wayne's been going up the statue of perfect man you know fear began in the Garden of Eden when they took one word off and they separated them from communion with God and Adam as as uh you know the the little the first thing they did running around trying to figure out what to do to the account to cover themselves because of what they had done and then went around because you know what without uh without a real understanding you'll have fear and that's what they did they didn't know what to do and they ran and got behind a little Bush and covered themselves up with fig leaves and trying to cover themselves up ain't no we know the way brother Brandon explained it covering themselves with with some denominational doctor and some kind of idea out of her own head but you know as we were just reading how John explains it we know that the Son of God is coming hath given us an understanding and When God says the word of God in your heart that is quickened then it dries out excuse me it drives out fear you don't have fear anymore and that's what God has been doing all down through the Old Testament through the New Testament through your personal Journey driving out driving out the fear that we've been held in bondage of because as soon as they that promise to Adam and Eve as soon as you eat him the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and that day you will die and Mankind ever since then has been held in the bondage of death fear of death fear of of uh fear that you can't keep God's word fear that there's nothing that you can do now how how can you come back to God on your own moral uh on your own the things that you do how can you satisfy God's requirement but the only side effects the only way to satisfy that is by uh is what through what Jesus did on the cross that he made a way for him to come back and put that perfect love in US perfect love is perfect and there's only perfect love is not some some nebulous thing floating around like that has been explained so many times perfect love is a person perfect love is the person of Jesus Christ that came and lived in the human heart how and that's what John is explaining to hear how that God could could come and put himself inside of a human vessel I'm trying to find a scriptures either all these things that he talked about he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him here it is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world so you think about it perfectly in this day when everyone is shaken by the things around them that your job things that might seem nervous and everybody is always in a tizzy and uh everything is just out of kilter but the only thing that's really rock solid is this perfect love and a life of a believer now here's some I'll just read some things that brother Reynolds said about about perfect love Faith is the substance 1951. he said now love one another above everything that you do love one another and as you love one another you'll love God see you love each other and you'll love God from God is love and a man that walks in love walks in life and perfect love casts about all fear then if you can take him at his word and not fear a bit about it say Lord I love you I know you're going to answer because you promised me you would and I just know I'm going to do it see and it takes away all fear Now isn't that what John said this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will according to his will he Hearth us and if we know that heareth hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him because there's no fear because fear is the ways that Satan has put between us and God that you don't know whether or not he's going to keep his word you don't know whether his word is for you or not and remember brother Branham explained that he he doing a little story of the uh the man in his life and how how you talk about it uh as he would go over disease how he trusted his wife and she trusted him now he's not just talking about a little marriage relationship he's talking about our relationship with God if there's no fear between us and God then we can trust him that his word is true that if he says if he made a promise to us about our children or about our Salvation that is for us and to us and it casts out fear that's right there's no fear and love John 8 31 39. now here he's talking to a groups of people that uh people that did not know anything about perfect love and they they were have been around Jesus then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him they were there with him and believed on him and he said if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now there's something that we see in the message so many people fail to do is continue than the word like that little Parable that that brother Dale's been teaching on of the sower that went forth to sow and the Word was sown when the word is sown into good ground where you receive the word and hold on to it until it can mature then it'll bring forth fruits if you continue in my word hang on a little bit until the day of Pentecost so that perfect love can come in you hang on a little bit until that word becomes life and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free free from the bondage of sin and death the answer and we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man I'll say is that thou ye shall be made free and Jesus answered him verily verily I say unto you whosoever commit a sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed and I free indeed now you know brother Branham explained it as you as a sanctification is coming over that that uh the uh like Moses and the children of Israel coming over that uh the Red Sea and all the Egyptians perished now when God delivers you from something it's you don't you have to you don't have to go walking home with those Egyptians that were destroyed by the water coming and and taken out just wiping out in the past you're free if the son therefore shall make you free shall be free indeed I know that you are Abraham's seed but ye seek to kill me because of my word has no place in you I speak that which I've seen with my father and you do that which you've seen with your father they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto them if you were Abraham's children he would do the works of Abraham what's the works of Abraham to have faith to believe God to believe his promises and they thought they were Abraham's seed the natural when Paul in Hebrews explains that you're Abraham deceived by the new birth not of seed and natural but a seed spiritual enroll in chapter 8 14 is uh for what lesson what we're looking at in the in the Bible study of a few weeks ago and and this really uh got me to thinking on this for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry I have a father because when you receive the new birth it takes out all the fear that you know I I I'm really speaking on this because you look around and you see so many that are fearful when things come upon you uh there's got to be ups and downs in your life there's got to be a little troughs and valleys and things where things don't go so well but those things are given to us to perfect us to make us rely on God more and when things go wrong that doesn't mean that God isn't watching other things anymore because don't we believe that all things work together for the gift of them that love God everything is working good for your purpose to bring you into a closer Fellowship to bring you into closer communion with God so what do we have to fear if if God's PR if God is for us who can be against us right and maybe this almost sounds like a motivational speech but by the New Birth by the power of God that God has put in our lives there should be no fear at all uh we should be able to come boldly before the throne of grace and boldly as competition there whatsoever things we require he's more than faithful to give it to us because his word says it right yes now if it was my words on the paper you know I could doubt or you know you know how can I convince anybody in this room that that I you know that I couldn't do anything you can't make one hair red or red or white you can't add but I put taking thought you can't add one measure stature to your to your to your stature that's right but what God has written uh we can put confidence in yes Hebrews 2 14-15 4 as much then as the children are partakers reflection blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy them you know that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subjects to bondage through fear of death where all their lifetime the subject to bondage now that is a great thing to be delivered from the fear of death where you can look bright and death right in the face and say you know like Paul did if they cut my head off death wears your sting grave where is your Victory because the believer if perfect love is in The Believer and you're one with God what can separate you from the love of God nothing can separate you in second Timothy 1 7 2 through 18 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind now here's Paul telling this this uh motivational speak to speech to Timothy as he's as he's a prisoner he's saying don't God hasn't hasn't given us up to this spirit of fear be not therefore ashamed of the testimony in our Lord nor of me as prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God so he's telling not to fear but yet there's going to be afflictions coming that seems contradictory though what a paradox you have saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but has now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and have brought life and immortality to life through the gospel now as soon as they were filled with the Holy Ghost with the power of God on the day of Pentecost then it looked like bad things started happening Peter was thrown in jail they went after they started going after the Christians they uh uh wasn't long before Peter was was crucified upside down on the cross and and the Christians were dispersed in all all the world to give their lives one after the other but yet God Jesus Christ has evolved with this has abolished death abolished death by bringing us back into communion with him and let's keep reading this book where unto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles for the winter calls I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know whom I have believed now there's when fear has a is a biologist I know whom I have believed and in persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day I know whom I have believed because perfect love has come in and cast out all of fear all the doubt and he's persuaded that he's able to keep that God has committed against that day in Matthew 14 26-27 and when the disciples saw him walking on the seat because God Jesus as he interacted with the disciples he was always trying to get them to believe and not be afraid because Satan brings fear God cast out fear that he when the presence of God comes it it gets rid of that fear and when the disciples saw him walking on the scene There Were Trouble saying it is a spirit and they cry out for fear the straight week he's just speaking of them saying be a good cheer at his eye be not afraid you know so many times you know even the young kids and things when you get into a service where where people the spirit begins to fall and people begin to shout and and cry out it's it's a little bit I'm scaring some and maybe that's how the disciples were when they saw Jesus walking on the water it was a little bit scary but just just give over to God a little bit and let him work and move and that fear will leave you be able to get cheater in his eye be not afraid and Jesus is always struggling with the disciples to believe why do you doubt and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and call him on people you're walking on the water and he began to come back to go to the boat and begin to doubt and said unto him oh thou a little faith wherefore this thou doubt because of fear looking around the circumstances when perfect love love comes you begin to those the circumstances begin to fade away like Abraham if we're the Seed of Abraham then we look at things just like Abraham did not counting the things at all but look around and there's no baby but it doesn't matter because God's word God's word says he promised to God he's personally spoke to Abraham and now God has personally spoke to us by the opening of the word by prophet's message and it should take away all the fear and he says and then why are you feeling prepared for all ye of little faith any arose and rebuke the winds in the sea and it was a great calm Luke 12 4-12 I say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and half after that have no more that they can do because you know there's a bad kind of fear that Satan brings but there's a good kind of fear there's one thing that we should fear and that is God right just be fearful of him but I will forewarn you whom you shall fear fear him after which he hath me fear Him which after he has killed have power to cast from the hell yeah I say unto you fear Him now right after that he tells a reason not to be afraid are not five stars over the Farthing and not one of them is forgotten before God but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are more value than many spirits now see we worry about what's going to happen tomorrow and we're about losing jobs and different things we worry about so many things to worry about but when God comes on the scene he takes away all the fear now I I'm saying this to be helpful so if you're worried about anything get along with God until the fear is gone because God will drive away the fear if there's anything troubling you in your life you don't have to be like that you don't have to be tossed about and all in a tizzy about everything let God come on the scene and drive the fear away yes let me say uh my yoke is easy and my burden is Life cast all your cares upon me that's how we're supposed to be walking we're not supposed to be walking with this heavy burden like uh in that story that John Bunyan wrote about the Pilgrim's Progress about how the man was the pilgrim the pilgrim was walking with this great big old huge burden on his back right and then he found Jesus and that burden was lifted now it wouldn't be strange for him to keep walking through his Christian Journey with that great big bird on his back God God don't want us to walk through this life with fear and and trepidation and worry and all these different things the pastor cares upon Jesus also I was saying to you whosoever shall confess me before me and him shall the son of man also confessed before the angels of God but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the endless of God and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man that shall be forgiven him but unto him to blast him against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven and when they bring you into the synagogues that sounds like a scary situation but even then don't fear because perfect love is there and under magistrates and Powers take ye no thought how or what things you should all answer now doesn't that seem totally contrary to the way that we want to have a lot of time to meditate our answer everything but if God is there if God is on the same then just give it over to him take ye no thought how what thing he shall answer or what you shall say for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say and there's another promise he'll give you what to say when you're challenged by your family or by your people that don't believe acts 27 21-26 but after long abstinence Paul stood out he's been Shipwrecked it looks like they're in a bad place tossed it for under the midst of them and said sirs you should have heartened unto me and not have loose from Creed and to have gained this on the loss and now I exhort you to be a good cheater because an angel would come on a scene so there shall be no loss of any man's life of money you put up this year so they stood by me this night the angel of God he's I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before senior now there's some contradiction too don't fear because you've got to be wrong before seasoning oh my that sounds scary Paul you got to be brought before seizure and then they gonna take you and cut your head off but fear not fear not Paul that must be brought before Caesar and love God had given me all in this cell with him the wherefore serves would be of good tier for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me now there's a testimony I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me and that's what perfect love casteth out fear means you don't fear to believe that you can you can keep the Commandments of God that's what brother Reynolds said because the keeper of The Commandments of God is living inside of you you don't fear to believe his word because the one that can believe this word is living inside of you you don't fear anymore for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me is that how we our only read God's word I believe God because that even as it was told me I believe it all of his promises Luke 21 25 28 and there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations would replace it with the sea in the ways of roaring men as Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken all that all the things that are happening around the world today earthquakes and diverse places everything is happening showing that God is doing something that he's he's he's making himself manifest in a bride and the end of the Earth is coming and he's fixing to wipe the thing clean but if you're safe in him safe in Christ there's no room for fear there's no reason to fear and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your ends from your Redemption draws now a lower program said and Jairus and Divine Healing well now if God is here all in this building right now do you believe that we're all conscious we're wish I you can't get it all in one night you see you're conscious and God is here now the only thing that we can do is work according to the law of God for our healing is that right what is the law of God is love perfect love cast out all fear love and faith is the same thing see love perfect love cast out all fear which gives Faith you see and that's why when you're born again you're right there at Faith because perfect love comes in and drives out to fear and now you can believe God's word Jairus and Divine Healing now if you'll just love God with all your heart and if you've done something to your neighbor or somebody just say in your heart now I love them too see and I love God with all my heart and I have brought around my criticized you a little bit but I love you anyway I'll see you all right now just let that take place like that and just get that whole atmosphere in here of love then watch the law of God go to work just on that see that's how it's just the same as it made the Hornets go back as it stopped the bull in the field and so he comes the perfect love isn't just like some emotion but it's a person that's coming on the scene to take control to drive out all the fear that we can believe in Fellowship 1956 he said and you can't have faith till you have love that's just all there is to it perfect love casts out all fear and you as long as you got fear you can't have faith so you got to have love first it drives all fear out and then faith comes in takes the place of fear so when you have that you're coming right along because if you've got fear that God's going to keep his word for you then happy and you have faith but perfect feet perfect love comes along and makes you believe God's word and draws out that fear let's look at what he says here in love but the strange thing was that when the man went up there I wasn't afraid he's talking about that man that fell down in his feet that uh with the people Spirit now perfect love casts out fear and that's the reason people won't take God at his word for healing they don't love him well enough because you're scared he won't keep his word hmm how about that that's the reason that people fear somebody else will say something against them if they receive the Holy Spirit they're afraid somebody will laugh and make fun but when love comes in you're not afraid anymore that same sermon but brother when you come to a place where you got love it will never fail that's right if my wife trusted me because I give her ten dollars every time I left four brother that wouldn't be very much signed I loved her I'd be right or true but when she knows that I love her when I know she loves me then there's a perfect trust between each other now he's talking about us and God is there a perfect trust between us and God to know that he loves us do you know that he loves you when you go through hard times do you know that he loves you when you read his word and you can read it without fear no worry at all then when you've got perfect love of God in your heart you don't question God about anything when the Bible said I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases you say Amen Lord that's right that's me Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you're ending with power for going high that's me Lord perfect love casts out fear Mark 11 21-26 and Peter calling to remember saith on the young mastered behold the Fig Tree which thou curses is withered away and Jesus asked me saying unto them have faith in God for barely I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and meet our cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his Harvest Shall Believe those things which you say except come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and then he switches over to something else what we just read Brother Brad I'm talking about love one another because you don't want anything between you and God to hinder your face or between you and your brother to hinder your faith and look what God oh Look what Jesus said when you stand praying forgive if ye have all against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses now you forgive one another God will forgive you and then there's no fear you can approach God boldly looking into his promises and claiming him boldly believing that God will give you the petition of your heart and Hebrews 4 1 he says let us therefore fear lest the promise be left being left us uh I just got a few more minutes entering into his rest any of you should see him come short of it Ephesians 5 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God because Godly feared is right it's only if you do this 212 wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed knowledge in my presence only but now much more of my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling because being concerned about being pleased in God which is something that in this old layout of CN age you can see that not many have anymore now fear that the American style fears is like brothers said just go through the graveyard wisdom like I don't care but but here we got a real fear and trembling concern about the things of God are concerned about being pleasing to him because that's what love is love is that if you love me you'll obey my Commandments is what Jesus said foreign First Timothy 5 20 then let sin revealed before all that others also May fear there's a there's a strong review in the scene rebuke before all just rebuke right right out in front of everybody that all that that others also May fear now that's something we see we're so afraid that others will find our faults then others will see that you know we're human or whatever first Peter 3 1 2 likewise G wives being subjected to your own husbands that if anybody not the word they also know it may without the word be won by the conversation with the wise while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear more greater fear of God and his requirements than fear of somebody saying well won't you just wear shorts or whatever don't you you know what's so great about the Bible because they they that's how that's how he's saying you win your husband now you're unbelieving husband through your Chase conversation coupled with fear of God honor all men first Peter 2 17 love the Brotherhood see how he phrases it on our own meaning love the Brotherhood but fear God honor the king you don't have to fear the king but honor the fear of God now this is just a little a little thing I put together that shows the meaning of fearing God in that last in that last scripture fear God to fear be afraid to fear God to be feared be honored to be feared to to respect and in Israel in the church in 1953 brother remember says Don't Be Afraid Of Satan as long as you're in him but if you're not in him you better tremble but if you're in him not even then itself can harm you are free from all fear oh when I think of that I want to shout out Hallelujah and then I mean I'm in here Romans 8 26-28 he said likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we all but the spirit itself makes an intercession for us with groans which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the Mind and Spirit because he makes an intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good for them that love God then who ought to call according to his purpose what shall we then say to these things God before us who can be against us amen we'll stop right there God bless you
