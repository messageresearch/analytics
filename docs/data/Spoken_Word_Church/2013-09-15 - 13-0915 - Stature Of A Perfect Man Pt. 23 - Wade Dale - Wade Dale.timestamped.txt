[0:02] we're talking on the statute of a
[0:03] perfect man right we've got to Virtue we
[0:06] spent 20 classes on faith and the
[0:11] foundation so we're going to start last
[0:14] week we went and
[0:17] U dealt a little with virtue but
[0:20] let's let's look at it again the
[0:22] definition of
[0:24] virtue definition of virtue is
[0:26] Conformity to a standard of right or
[0:30] particular moral
[0:33] Excellence it's an order of angels
[0:35] quality or power of a thing all right
[0:38] you just keep
[0:40] going come on in manly strength or
[0:43] courage a commendable quality of trait a
[0:45] capacity to act and then Chastity
[0:48] especially in a woman now brother B said
[0:50] virtue this virtue in the pyramid was
[0:53] not virgin living amen why you should
[0:58] have done that at Faith
[1:00] right at the new birth should have took
[1:02] away with all
[1:04] that you should have virtue when you
[1:06] begin to or live a virtuous life when
[1:09] you become a Christian all right so that
[1:11] virtue is not talking about being a
[1:13] virgin all right or being a chase like
[1:16] Chastity especially in a woman but we
[1:18] know through the prophet's message that
[1:20] it was power or strength virtue is
[1:24] strength and then some of you like
[1:25] Sister Lisa it's a character and it's
[1:27] something that it's something that you
[1:29] have to deal with
[1:31] yourself all these virtues sure it has
[1:33] to be shown to other people but like my
[1:37] example with
[1:39] Peter Peter didn't have to get virtue
[1:42] real quick at the gate beautiful he
[1:45] already had it
[1:46] amen and he knew he had that's
[1:50] right or he wouldn't stop he wouldn't
[1:53] give it to that person Silver and Gold
[1:55] Have I
[1:56] night in other words like I said there's
[1:58] no way I mean here you and now what we
[2:00] do today is we see somebody down and out
[2:03] and can't pay the hospital bills what
[2:04] the first thing we do we go okay we'll
[2:06] we'll give you some some money get way
[2:08] we'll give you some money
[2:10] here and go fix your
[2:14] problem but Peter walks up and doesn't
[2:16] even have a billfall doesn't have a
[2:19] check in account he doesn't have a
[2:20] credit card so what is he telling the
[2:22] what is he telling the the the man he
[2:24] said look man I can't even afford to pay
[2:27] my bills much l yours so and Gold Have I
[2:30] None it's what he was saying monetary
[2:32] amount I don't
[2:33] have but such as I have not such as I'm
[2:37] going to get such as I have give I un
[2:40] thee cuz there's no way Peter could have
[2:42] put it in the Eternal Word of God to add
[2:44] to your faith virtue virtue knowledge
[2:45] knowledge temper unless he had it
[2:47] himself already that's right right so
[2:49] that's what you and I got to realize
[2:51] first you and I got to realize that that
[2:53] virtue and strength comes from you oh
[2:56] yes it's the Holy Ghost working in you
[2:59] but that ver has to be a birth it has to
[3:01] be something a birth means to come
[3:04] forth right being born again who said
[3:07] that Peter so he ought to know that
[3:09] these things are being birthed in you as
[3:12] you go through your Christian journey
[3:14] and we get a little bit of each one it's
[3:16] not that we get full of virtue and then
[3:18] it's like a cup it fills up and then it
[3:20] runs over into knowledge and then
[3:22] knowledge fills up and it runs no it's
[3:24] it's like I told him brother Tim I don't
[3:26] like those lines in the pyramid they're
[3:27] just for illust ation purposes right
[3:31] really I believe they need to turn them
[3:33] this
[3:34] way you got to have faith all the way up
[3:36] you got to have virtue all the way up
[3:38] you got to have knowledge all the way up
[3:39] you got to have Temperance all the way
[3:41] up bti and godliness all the way up the
[3:43] pyramid not that you stop and say well
[3:45] I'm full of virtue I don't need anymore
[3:48] no you'll be a virtuous person till the
[3:51] day you get out of here that's right
[3:52] right and same thing with knowledge
[3:54] Temperance patience and all the way up
[3:56] so let's read what brother rham said
[3:58] about this in the angel of the Lord you
[4:01] can read it here on the screen can y'all
[4:03] see that in the back box can you see
[4:04] that okay the woman that touched to him
[4:08] of His Garment got the blessing that she
[4:10] asked for he felt virtue go out so he
[4:13] had to have it yeah he had to have it
[4:16] for it to go out all right but when them
[4:19] men that know he was a prophet there a
[4:21] woman went the well knew he was a
[4:23] prophet put a rag around his head and
[4:26] hit him on the head with a reed and said
[4:28] now if you're a prophet tell us who you
[4:30] they didn't feel no virtue why it was
[4:32] the way you approach
[4:34] it everybody understand what I'm talking
[4:36] about the way you approach it you can
[4:38] rub shoulders with people all day long
[4:40] and they not draw any virtue from you at
[4:42] all right even though you have it
[4:47] right that's faithful that's right
[4:51] that's why brother Brown said Faith at
[4:53] the bottom of the pyramid is the most
[4:54] important that's the most important you
[4:56] got to have faith that you have virtue
[4:59] remember what I said about the Bible
[5:00] don't don't don't think that I'm that
[5:02] I'm U um adding to the word or taking
[5:05] from but the Bible says add to your
[5:07] faith
[5:08] virtue well add to what you
[5:11] believe ain't that the same thing as
[5:13] Faith yes add to what you believe
[5:17] virtue add to what you believe knowledge
[5:21] add to what you believe Temperance add
[5:23] to what you believe patient cuz it's
[5:26] what you believe first it's like sister
[5:27] Lis said it was very good the Fountain
[5:29] is inside the fountain is not something
[5:31] out there sure Jesus is the fountain but
[5:33] where is he
[5:34] now he's IM morphi right here he's
[5:37] nowhere else right come on now we know
[5:40] God's omnipresent omniscient but if
[5:43] we're the last and morphe of God this is
[5:45] where God is yes he's he's he's he wants
[5:49] that to work he wants that Fountain he
[5:51] wants you to see that that Fountain but
[5:53] you know what you control the nozzle yes
[5:57] of the
[5:58] fountain you really do you control but
[6:02] you go through life though and if you go
[6:04] out in your job place and you and you
[6:07] and you do little things that are wrong
[6:09] and people see that you do things wrong
[6:12] they can't draw virtue from that but if
[6:14] you go through where where Jesus was
[6:17] walking through a throng of
[6:19] people those people around him some of
[6:21] them didn't like him some of them hated
[6:23] him some of loved
[6:25] him but they didn't have a
[6:28] need like that little woman that had
[6:31] that had basically been on her period
[6:33] for 12 years I think it was 12 years she
[6:38] was having this issue of blood problem
[6:41] been to doctors brother Brown makes the
[6:43] illustration she spent all of her money
[6:45] she went to every doctor in other words
[6:46] she went to Mayo Clinic she went
[6:48] everywhere and they said we can't help
[6:50] you but she saw a man one time that I'm
[6:53] sure she had heard a lot of and finally
[6:56] she saw him and she said if I can touch
[6:57] the just the himem of the Garment I'll
[6:59] be made whole well when she touched him
[7:02] in Mark 5:30 we'll read here it says
[7:04] Jesus immediately knowing in himself see
[7:07] nobody else around him knew it m that's
[7:11] right no Peter didn't even know it
[7:13] that's right of course Peter didn't have
[7:15] the Holy Ghost at that time so he didn't
[7:16] have anything to contact with true right
[7:20] holy ghost hadn't been given so Jesus
[7:21] hadn't died so there was the Holy Ghost
[7:23] Peter was saying well actually you
[7:25] rebuke the Lord he said Lord everybody's
[7:27] touching you that's right
[7:29] in another word you mean somebody
[7:31] touched me but he
[7:33] said he knowing in himself that virtue
[7:36] had gone out of him turned him about in
[7:38] the press and said who touched my
[7:41] clothes now the Greek lexican for virtue
[7:45] is
[7:46] dunamus dunamus is power Mighty work or
[7:51] strength brother Ernie vill Anda he he
[7:54] preaches a lot on on on dunamus he has
[7:57] spoken several times here on that and I
[8:00] I like that word that's power Mighty
[8:02] work and strength and we know that when
[8:05] brother brandham and then look what not
[8:07] it's
[8:08] Miracle might virtue Mighty then you got
[8:12] a miscellaneous form strength power and
[8:14] ability inherent
[8:19] power inherent power let me say
[8:23] something too remember what I said
[8:26] before people can have a certain amount
[8:29] of these virtues and not even be a
[8:31] Christian that's right that's what the
[8:32] prophet say it's actually per yeah
[8:34] because there are people that I like to
[8:36] be around that's not even Christians you
[8:37] say not Christians I said yeah because
[8:39] that like jimes Dad he has a virtue
[8:41] about him that he's a kind man he knows
[8:44] how to deal with business and I like in
[8:46] that aspect I like to be around him but
[8:48] now when he comes to the word of God he
[8:50] knows nothing about it there's no
[8:51] there's nothing to there's no Fountain
[8:54] to draw from so I don't draw virtue from
[8:56] that but there are people in our life
[8:59] amen that are virtuous people yes that
[9:01] you can draw strength from and if you'll
[9:03] listen to them they'll teach you
[9:04] something about life but now when it
[9:06] comes to God that's what I told Jim's
[9:08] dad one time and I he was sitting here I
[9:09] tell it again cuz I told it to him one
[9:11] time before I said I'll listen to you
[9:14] when it comes to matters of life but
[9:17] when it comes to the matters of the word
[9:18] of God I said you don't even know what
[9:20] happened with Jesus and the Pharisees
[9:22] cuz I was trying to explain to him one
[9:23] day he never read the Bible maybe he
[9:25] read it when he back he's 80 years old
[9:26] he probably read it 50 years ago and
[9:28] forgot most of it so but see you can
[9:30] draw virtue or strength
[9:32] from he has an inherent virtue from just
[9:35] the DNA of
[9:37] life okay but God doesn't want to deal
[9:41] in that because that will fail yes
[9:44] that's the point that will fail this
[9:47] virtue will never fail amen it'll carry
[9:50] you right on into the future
[9:52] home that virtue will help people it
[9:56] will help look it says inherent power
[9:59] power
[10:01] residing residing In A Thing by virtue
[10:06] of its
[10:08] nature that's why by the new birth we
[10:10] have to have a nature change
[10:13] yes reading first Peter says or second
[10:16] Peter says what having the divine nature
[10:19] of
[10:20] God then he says add to your faith
[10:23] virtue and your virtue knowledge
[10:24] knowledge Temperance but inherent power
[10:26] power residing In A Thing by virt of its
[10:29] nature or which a person or thing exerts
[10:32] or puts forth see there's a two- stage
[10:34] thing you got to have
[10:36] it and you got to be able to give it all
[10:40] right you got to have it you got to be
[10:43] able to give it all right power for
[10:46] performing Miracles are moral power and
[10:49] Excellence of Soul all right so that's
[10:52] the Strong's definition of that word
[10:54] when Jesus said virtue has went from me
[10:57] the power and influence which belong
[10:59] belongs to riches and wealth see there
[11:00] you go to the Natural side of it all
[11:04] right power and resources arising from
[11:06] numbers power consisting in or resting
[11:08] upon armies forces and host all right
[11:11] now in Luke 6:19 we read another version
[11:14] of what happened and the whole multitude
[11:16] sought to touch him but there went
[11:18] virtue out of him and healed them all
[11:20] now they sought to touch him they well
[11:23] just one woman this is another example
[11:25] another account of him going somewhere
[11:28] and said heal them
[11:30] all man he had a lot of virtue yes all
[11:34] right so that same virtue of that
[11:36] person's got to be in in in you and I
[11:38] then Luke 8:45 and Jesus said who
[11:41] touched me when all denied Peter said
[11:43] they that were with him said Master the
[11:45] multitude throng thee and press thee and
[11:47] sayest thou who touched me and Jesus
[11:49] said
[11:51] somebody in other words hasn't
[11:53] physically touched me yes cuz she didn't
[11:56] physically touch Jesus in his body
[11:58] that's that's right she just grabbed a
[12:00] hold of His Garment as it walked by she
[12:02] just touched it all right and Jesus said
[12:05] somebody have touched me for I perceive
[12:07] that virtue has gone out of me all right
[12:11] in perseverance brother Brown said now
[12:12] perseverance to be
[12:14] persistent to try to make a goal trying
[12:17] to you got your mindset on something and
[12:18] you're persistent in it CU you believe
[12:21] it's the thing that you want and believe
[12:22] you can get it now pardon me to be
[12:25] persistent you've got your mind made up
[12:28] now that you're going to do now you
[12:30] cannot have faith in God without knowing
[12:32] the word of God or knowing something
[12:34] about God now watch here's his point now
[12:37] someone told you if you go touch that
[12:39] post you'll get well you're sick I
[12:42] wouldn't believe that why there's no
[12:44] virtue in the post right virtue has to
[12:48] come from somebody person all right I
[12:52] wanton I won't believe that I wouldn't
[12:54] believe that you might do it but that's
[12:56] just a little too
[12:57] strong for my
[13:00] faith I don't believe there's any virtue
[13:02] in that post yes no more than I believe
[13:04] there's virtue in a statue or a monument
[13:06] or a truth crucifix or something like
[13:08] that I believe the virtue is in Christ
[13:10] and Christ is the word yes all right in
[13:13] beginning was the word word with God
[13:15] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[13:17] and dwelt Among Us now the word itself
[13:19] comes back in the form of the Holy
[13:20] Spirit into us and it's word in you God
[13:24] in you so many wants to point God to
[13:27] some mystical something wh away are so
[13:29] far away they overreach it God's in you
[13:33] amen the hope of glory Christ the mind
[13:35] that within Christ is in you you're
[13:37] reaching Plum away from that trying to
[13:39] get what's been given to you God in the
[13:43] human being so there is the virtue God
[13:47] in the human being all
[13:49] right I mean you can't draw you can't
[13:52] draw
[13:53] virtue
[13:55] from like he said a light poster a or a
[13:59] car you got to draw virtue and streng
[14:02] that kind of virtue and strength comes
[14:03] from an inner being working its way out
[14:06] like I said many times before it's
[14:08] happened to me once in my life that I
[14:11] know of for sure than that was in
[14:13] Jamaica and that that I got so weak that
[14:15] I couldn't that I had to sell down and U
[14:18] and it's happened one time before in
[14:19] personal life um for something that I
[14:22] was asking about but to get that
[14:25] virtue to get that virtue you got to
[14:27] have a need oh yes okay you got to have
[14:30] a need right so see we come to Faith you
[14:34] see how these things are laid out
[14:37] Faith got to have faith you got to
[14:39] believe then you got to have virtue in
[14:42] in in what you believe strength yes in
[14:46] the beginning was the word that's where
[14:47] it's got to come from it's got to come
[14:48] from the word of God see then you come
[14:50] up to knowledge all right so we're going
[14:53] back it's exactly lined out the way it
[14:55] should be all right so you got to have
[14:57] faith got you got to have a lot of
[14:59] virtue because virtue to me is very
[15:02] important look at brother randam he's a
[15:05] human mortal man I don't know if we'll
[15:07] get to read it right now or not but
[15:09] remember how many times in the prayer
[15:10] line they'd have to carry him off the
[15:13] platform why he said it's not me friend
[15:16] it's you doing it that's right he had it
[15:20] he knew he had it yes Silver and Gold
[15:22] Have I None he could say but such as I
[15:25] have I give to you well he just didn't
[15:26] give it to one man that's right it was
[15:28] good at night after night that's why I
[15:31] was telling him the other day brother
[15:32] Tim he he died at 56 years old but he
[15:35] look like he was about 70 yes just the
[15:37] same with Jesus was 30 and they thought
[15:40] he was 50
[15:41] right I mean you're living in two Realms
[15:44] and people are pulling from you all the
[15:47] time yes people are pulling like a
[15:50] pastor is is a u is a Workhorse like we
[15:53] were talking he's an ox he's a burden
[15:55] Bearer well he's bearing your burdens
[15:57] whether you know it or not that's
[15:59] right but the reason we come to this
[16:02] church is we believe that there's virtue
[16:03] and strength here yes or you go
[16:06] somewhere else right so would I so that
[16:09] Pastor you're drawing brother BR said he
[16:11] said You Preach one sermon is eight
[16:13] hours work that's one sermon he preaches
[16:17] two he gets double over
[16:20] time yes I was thinking of when Jesus
[16:24] healed them all it was a great crowd and
[16:27] it was they weren't Christians they
[16:29] couldn't have been
[16:31] there and all those people drew from The
[16:35] Fountain the Everlasting he didn't he
[16:38] didn't he got weak probably so it's it's
[16:41] that
[16:43] Faith now watch now what me with that
[16:45] point brother BR gets up and he says
[16:49] you're this you're this you're this
[16:50] you're this and then after about 20
[16:52] people he's just gone but now he said I
[16:55] can go sit and have a vision from God
[16:58] and it not bother me a bit right why
[17:01] that's not God's not drawing virtue from
[17:03] Brother brand right right brother
[17:06] Brown's drawn virtue from God which is
[17:08] an everlasting Fountain and in the body
[17:10] he's in now the glorified body he's in
[17:13] now he's not going to ever get weak
[17:15] that's right he's finished with that his
[17:17] days of the intercessory are over right
[17:20] he's still the high priest you
[17:21] understand but he's glorified when we
[17:23] get glorified he don't have to be an
[17:25] intercessor anymore that's right okay so
[17:27] he's in a glor ifed body he never gets
[17:31] weak that's why he said when I come back
[17:33] as the Holy Ghost I'm not going in other
[17:34] words I'm not going to be weak and have
[17:35] to go sleep in a boat and and you know
[17:38] and let a storm I mean how in the world
[17:39] this boat was not big true he was laying
[17:43] at the bow of the boat asleep then the
[17:45] storm comes up and he's still sleeping
[17:47] brother Brown said he had a prayer line
[17:49] right weak in the body but see now we
[17:51] draw off brother Brown says the
[17:53] Everlasting Fountain yes the Eternal
[17:55] Fountain so it just keeps flowing but
[17:57] what it does though it flows down into
[17:59] you and then you're a
[18:01] conduit you're a conduit you're God to
[18:05] the people that's what I told him that's
[18:07] what I told him in witch I said God
[18:09] doesn't want to stay God by
[18:12] himself that's right he wants you to be
[18:16] God act like God that's what this is
[18:19] that's the statue that when Jesus walked
[18:21] on the earth as a human man but he was
[18:23] almighty God that's the way he acted yes
[18:25] he didn't act no different than that oh
[18:28] we got a little mad throw it
[18:30] away but you what didn't stay mad long
[18:33] because you know what it's like what
[18:34] daddy always said he beat him out of the
[18:37] temple but I'm sure he stopped and
[18:40] prayed for him somewhere in the
[18:42] somewhere in the in the daily walk he
[18:44] would pray for him and that's what I
[18:46] believe Jesus cuz remember when he was
[18:47] on the cross he was praying for him so
[18:50] that's the character and look at virtue
[18:53] him hanging on the cross now look to me
[18:56] and you if we were to if we were to just
[18:57] not at know anything about Jesus walk up
[19:00] to the crucifixion see three people
[19:03] hanging there he'd be no different than
[19:05] anybody else but now watch the thief on
[19:09] the
[19:10] right and the thief on the
[19:14] left in his in you know they both were
[19:16] mocking him at first but something about
[19:20] that
[19:22] man
[19:24] touched that man Jesus something about
[19:26] that man touched this one over here
[19:28] this one over here didn't draw anything
[19:30] off of him this one over here Drew
[19:31] something from him yes cuz he realized
[19:34] that the man was different and that's
[19:36] the same way I want us to be in our life
[19:38] in our walk I want people to say not
[19:41] that I testify that I'm a Christian I
[19:43] want somebody to say there goes somebody
[19:45] that's different they may not give you
[19:47] the title
[19:49] Christian because they see Christians
[19:51] that drink smoke cuss and I mean
[19:54] Christianity now is no more
[19:56] than you know nothing nothing it's
[19:58] really not anything you can do all those
[20:01] things and still be a Christian in this
[20:04] world but I want somebody to say hey
[20:06] he's different right than those people
[20:09] that claim to be Christians cuz that's
[20:11] the greatest stumbling block in the
[20:12] world is for you to claim you're a
[20:13] Christian and somebody see a beer in
[20:15] your hand or you know hear you cussing
[20:18] somebody out or anything like that but
[20:21] brother Brandon was he drew from God on
[20:24] those Visions so it didn't bother
[20:26] him okay okay same way with me and you
[20:31] cuz brother R said I can preach the word
[20:33] of God for 2 or 3 hours he said but now
[20:36] one or two of these visions of of the
[20:38] healing part of the vision that he had
[20:40] of the people he said it drains me dry
[20:43] right now why is there a difference cuz
[20:45] we're going to go upstairs today and
[20:48] we're going to listen to the word of God
[20:49] and we're going to feed off of that
[20:51] virtue okay yes we're not going to get
[20:55] weak right the preacher's going to get
[20:57] weak
[21:00] whether you see it or not virtue is
[21:02] being drawn but it's not making us weak
[21:04] cuz we're the one doing the drawing and
[21:05] that's why brother R could draw strength
[21:07] from God that's why we draw strength
[21:09] from the Holy Ghost I mean you sit and
[21:11] read your Bible and honest to goodness
[21:13] the devil's going to make you sleepy God
[21:16] won't you know that's right so I mean
[21:18] you can sit there and read your Bible
[21:19] all day long and not be not get weak cuz
[21:22] you're drawing strength from God but
[21:24] what God wants is is God wants somebody
[21:26] to draw strength from you
[21:28] amen is that not what our purpose is
[21:30] here for true so that's why virtue is
[21:33] very important one of the next ones in
[21:35] line right there after faith is virtue
[21:38] that you have the
[21:40] virtue let's read this one right here
[21:42] we'll see the Bible says we read over
[21:43] here in the Book of Luke where it says
[21:45] virtue one out of him all right
[21:46] congregation says amen we're going to be
[21:49] like him yes we must have virtue then
[21:53] see these things are a requirement we
[21:56] must have it to be like like him
[22:00] yes some of your sisters say well I I I
[22:03] I don't I don't preach and I how do
[22:05] people draw strength man you sisters
[22:08] draw more strength off of each
[22:11] other than you can from me or brother
[22:15] Dale cuz you know each other you're a
[22:19] different Venus and Mars remember you're
[22:21] different okay us men can draw strength
[22:24] off of men but what I'm saying is you
[22:27] sisters understand yourself you
[22:29] understand each other that's why y'all
[22:31] get together and and you ought to get
[22:32] together and you ought to you ought to
[22:34] talk about the Bible says many times
[22:37] about the younger should listen to the
[22:39] older that's right now that's the virtue
[22:41] part yes and that may not mean just
[22:44] exactly agewise
[22:46] true but maturity wise I've seen a lot
[22:49] of 60y old people that men that I
[22:51] wouldn't draw a lot of strength off of
[22:53] cuz they act like a 20-year old that's
[22:55] right but I've seen some 20-y old like
[22:57] brother um Glover up there 18 years old
[23:02] and you can draw strength from that guy
[23:04] because you know what he's got it in
[23:05] here amen it's not out here it's in here
[23:07] and it's not of age as far as when he
[23:09] was born into this world it was when he
[23:11] was born again right and he's made your
[23:14] available for God and that's the whole
[23:16] thing you got to make yourself available
[23:17] for God if we're going to be like him we
[23:20] must have virtue then we must have it to
[23:23] be like him is the first song that I
[23:26] ever loved in the him one of the
[23:28] greatest was to be like Jesus well if
[23:32] I'm going to be like Jesus I got to have
[23:34] virtue
[23:36] look and to pass that it can pass
[23:39] forward from
[23:41] me to the people
[23:43] yes don't just be see you the character
[23:46] in you should never be that I'm going to
[23:48] keep my virtue and never give it out
[23:50] that's not the character of God right
[23:53] character of God is I've got it I want
[23:54] to give it away that's true right
[23:59] I've got to have virtue and a Pion that
[24:00] can pass forward from me to the people
[24:02] because virtue went out of him to the
[24:04] people virtue and before you can let it
[24:06] out you got to have it first you haven't
[24:09] got it it won't come out there's nothing
[24:12] for it to come out what if someone tried
[24:14] to draw virtue out of us and the check
[24:15] would return insufficient fund see no no
[24:18] none there to draw from check bounc
[24:20] somebody looking at you as a Christian
[24:22] and tomorrow see you out here carrying
[24:24] on like a sinner not much virtue can be
[24:27] drawn
[24:28] from that let's just keep reading virtue
[24:31] must be in us and until we get virtue
[24:33] then then when we get true
[24:37] virtue we can add it to our
[24:41] faith remember what I said add to what
[24:43] you believe virtue yeah it's got to be
[24:45] what you believe after what you
[24:49] believe then when that truth then when
[24:51] we get true virtue we can add it to our
[24:54] faith that's the next foundation wall
[24:58] he's making it a wall it's a next
[25:00] foundation wall now first you must have
[25:03] faith faith alone won't do it
[25:06] wow right faith alone won't do
[25:09] it why you're not complete without with
[25:12] just having faith all right now first
[25:14] you must have faith faith alone won't do
[25:16] it you've got Peter said then add virtue
[25:18] to your faith you must have virtue in
[25:21] order to add it through your faith now
[25:23] then it might be the reason you don't
[25:24] have it because many churches of the day
[25:26] teach you don't have to have it
[25:28] or the days of it is passed they don't
[25:30] have to have it only thing you have to
[25:32] do is just join Church yeah days is
[25:35] passed virtue anyone knows what the word
[25:38] virtue means see and we must have it if
[25:40] virtue went from him to heal the woman
[25:42] that was sick he'd expecting the same
[25:44] virtue in his
[25:46] church amen because he was our example
[25:50] and if he had virtue to give it to the
[25:51] people he expects us to have virtue to
[25:54] give to the people and what is virtue
[25:56] virtue is strength
[25:58] and
[26:00] power he expects you what he said he
[26:03] said I in other words I expect you to
[26:05] give it out that's I don't expect you to
[26:07] keep it I expect you to give it out
[26:08] that's why we draw strength and virtue
[26:10] from each other we draw a lot of things
[26:13] that that uh sometimes are not good but
[26:18] uh that's the old human side and that's
[26:21] what we're trying to get rid of though
[26:23] cuz I'm sure cuz
[26:26] look Peter said I was on the mountain
[26:28] with
[26:29] God I saw the
[26:31] Transfiguration I saw all the things on
[26:33] that great Mountain saw the adoption of
[26:36] the Lord saw his body glow saw him
[26:39] glorified but then you come over into
[26:41] Peter after he receives a new birth and
[26:43] he said I have received now a more sure
[26:45] word of Prophecy yes what's a sure word
[26:48] of Prophecy it was in
[26:50] him not just the man that was standing
[26:53] on the mountain right that man on the
[26:54] mountain was now inside of him what
[26:56] about 20 in the upper
[27:00] room had these virtues birthed into
[27:02] their life why because they had heard
[27:04] from the man himself they didn't get it
[27:06] from 14and
[27:08] information or even secondhand
[27:10] information they got it from God
[27:12] Almighty cuz they walked three and a
[27:13] half years with it all right so these
[27:15] virtues were birth into them because why
[27:17] God knew that they would need it once
[27:19] they stepped out of that upper room that
[27:21] he knew they needed the full package
[27:23] deal to combat everything that was going
[27:26] cuz you know this was a new thing
[27:28] yes this was a new
[27:31] religion it was Jews Old Testament
[27:35] Jehova messiah's
[27:37] coming now they're teaching messiah's
[27:40] already come he's gone and come back
[27:42] he's now in us and we're going to go
[27:44] take it to the people so God had to God
[27:46] had to fortify them with all these
[27:48] virtues but now you and I as we begin as
[27:51] a newborn baby in Christ we don't have
[27:53] all these virtues we may have a portion
[27:55] of them but we won't have the the full
[27:57] part of virtue until one day God's going
[28:00] to reveal it to you cuz he will he'll
[28:02] reveal to you that you have virtue cuz
[28:04] it's only Revelation that's true add to
[28:06] what you
[28:07] believe
[28:09] virtue right and then what examples we
[28:13] were looking at examples you you look at
[28:15] people like Moses the people drew
[28:18] strength off of Moses but Moses had his
[28:21] problem people do strength off of David
[28:24] but David had his problem all right then
[28:26] you come on into the New Testament and
[28:29] look at
[28:30] U look at Peter James and John
[28:33] everywhere they went Mighty things
[28:34] happened why they have virtue yeah they
[28:36] had virtue and they had plenty of it
[28:39] because what
[28:41] happens with false
[28:45] Doctrine false Doctrine doesn't bring
[28:48] true
[28:49] virtue cuz you can't draw from that amen
[28:53] now some people might be deceived into
[28:56] liking it or believing it or whatever
[28:58] but false Doctrine will not produce true
[29:01] virtue so we got to get all that out of
[29:03] the
[29:04] way but a true understanding of the word
[29:07] of God you know what it
[29:10] does you got to have
[29:12] confidence cuz without confidence you
[29:15] can't have virtue true do everybody
[29:17] understand what I'm saying without
[29:18] confidence you can't have virtue we're
[29:21] getting ready to go upstairs man we're
[29:23] done we start at
[29:25] 10:00 no that's fine yeah them people
[29:28] don't tell you down there they don't
[29:29] tell you nothing sit
[29:31] down how you doing buddy good good good
[29:34] to see you good to see it U would that
[29:38] be U yeah go ahead the um River's
[29:43] plural of water s that flowing out of us
[29:46] those those eight eight virtues there
[29:49] yep CU faith is actually a virtue as
[29:51] well
[29:53] right yes well now actually yes it is
[29:58] but actually there's only seven ads cuz
[30:01] you get the seven ads gets you to love
[30:02] CU it says add to your
[30:05] faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 virtue knowledge
[30:08] Temperance patience godliness what
[30:11] brothery kindness and love all right but
[30:14] there is the eighth like the eighth day
[30:17] okay and that love up here at the top of
[30:19] the pyramid that's not anything to do
[30:23] with I love my wife I love my right job
[30:27] I love football I love I love no love to
[30:30] me is the
[30:33] worst defined word on this Earth
[30:37] wouldn't you say yes the worst defined
[30:40] word I love this oh I love to do this I
[30:43] love to read I love to do this I love to
[30:45] go hunting that that we eroded that word
[30:48] because that word right there
[30:50] love is a man came one day and died
[30:54] right yes gave his life right so that
[30:58] you can have eternal life that's correct
[31:01] he had it bottled up inside of him and
[31:03] there's no way to get it out unless that
[31:05] shell of the man the shell of the man
[31:08] not the inside the Inside Man can't die
[31:10] right he was God Almighty he wasn't a
[31:12] son or or a second person of a trinity
[31:15] he was God Almighty himself yeah now it
[31:17] would be I'd be a horrible Rascal if I
[31:19] was told my son said hey son you go down
[31:21] there and die for them people now what
[31:23] kind of daddy would that be no I'd go
[31:25] first yeah right there's no second
[31:28] person he was God Amen how many people
[31:32] have you ever saw stood on the face of
[31:34] the Earth and said I'll lay my life down
[31:37] and I'll pick my life back up you
[31:39] talking about it yesterday yeah what a
[31:41] powerful thing have have you heard
[31:42] anybody tell you that sir there's no
[31:45] human mortal man can do that it had to
[31:48] be God Almighty in a human flesh yeah
[31:52] because Isaiah 53 real quick for our
[31:55] visitors and for you Isaiah 5
[31:57] 53 he gave this for a sacrifice yes he
[32:02] was wounded for our transgressions
[32:03] bruised for our iniquity now the soul of
[32:05] God never went through that that's right
[32:08] but that soul of God was the ransom that
[32:11] was paid he gave his soul a ransom so he
[32:15] could see his seed so when his soul came
[32:18] out of that body at Calvary the Bible
[32:20] said the first thing he done was went to
[32:22] hell that's
[32:24] right and if he went to hell with
[32:26] eternal life in him which he did and
[32:28] preached or witnessed to the people that
[32:30] had never met him right what the Bible
[32:33] says went to the souls that were in
[32:34] prison preached to them that the
[32:36] longsuffering the days of Noah in other
[32:38] words Noah preached about Jesus he
[32:40] didn't say Jesus cuz he didn't know the
[32:41] name Jesus but he preached about God
[32:43] Almighty right saving a group of people
[32:46] yes it's sure he did they turned him
[32:48] down so God had to come down into hell
[32:51] and if he went to hell with eternal life
[32:52] in him right yes and if you have eternal
[32:56] life because of that that
[32:58] man that eternal life same eternal life
[33:00] that come out of him in Calvary comes
[33:02] back on to you at the New Birth when
[33:04] you're born again not when you quit
[33:06] drinking smoking cussing and running
[33:07] around right that's not it that's a good
[33:10] Sanctified life the devil can live that
[33:13] true he can Devil's not some s drunk
[33:16] right oh he's pretty religious
[33:18] guy but when that eternal life went to
[33:21] hell and preached to those people that
[33:22] was my representation that I don't have
[33:24] to go there amen
[33:28] brother Tim I've already been to Hell
[33:29] that's right so I don't have to go again
[33:32] yes God Almighty went to hell with me in
[33:35] him yes right and then when he came back
[33:38] and comes into me cleans that old me out
[33:41] kills that old nature of that person
[33:43] that was once the old wayale that was
[33:45] you couldn't even live with couldn't
[33:47] even live with myself when he drives
[33:49] that Spirit out puts his spirit in then
[33:54] you don't have to go to hell you already
[33:55] been there that's right
[33:57] all we go through hell on Earth sure but
[34:00] that's this thing yes yes but see Jesus
[34:03] did two things he gave his body the Lamb
[34:06] of God he gave his body as a sacrifice
[34:09] but he gave his soul a ransom yes right
[34:13] he ransomed us out in other words he
[34:15] said hey take me not them that's right
[34:18] but in taking him there goes to dingdong
[34:22] and taking him and putting him in hell I
[34:26] went with him so when he resurrected I
[34:28] rose with him I don't have to die again
[34:30] hallelujah amen amen but virtue we're
[34:32] going to stay on virtue one more Sunday
[34:34] and then we'll go to knowledge okay so
[34:35] just keep keep virtue in your
[34:55] mind
[34:58] okay
[35:03] it's
