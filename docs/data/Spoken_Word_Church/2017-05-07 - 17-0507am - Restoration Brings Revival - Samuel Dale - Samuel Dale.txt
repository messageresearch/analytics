========================================

from some 85 I was reading in this song and it said that Israel they limited the Holy One and I think the same thing happening with us that we limit what God can do cause we get to more of our stuff

Jesus Christ and then let's pray Heavenly Father as we go this morning God we praise your Holy Spirit is abiding in every heart while the let us forget about all things except your Holy Spirit as we

afternoon will be the communion time and also remember that just right Lord with Mitch okay we'll start reading in verse 23 we're going to read the verse 25 and then we'll be seated and then we'll come back after coming in but will we want cover the whole thing look what he says be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat the fat shall be shall overflow with wine and all and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the pummel worm my great army which I sent among you so you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we'll get back and just read the whole thing but we had a little time last night speaking about some things but I'm doing in the wind my wife we were listening to when I was speaking there when was it a couple weeks ago or whatever anyhow the last time I ministered and she is trying to count how many times I have spoke the word revival and she said you said that 70 something times I said well we were just kidding the cover what we're listing the things you didn't count them all because he counted them more now but anyhow I said well there's one thing for sure I want the people to understand what I believe and that way you can't say well why did brother Dale believe I preached one time for about an hour and 15 20 minutes hour and a half on manifestation of sons and daughters of God and a certain brother went home to eat lunch with us that day and the first thing he said you don't believe in manifestation sons of God do you I said I've spent an hour and a half telling you how much I did believe in and what it would be you know well I don't know whether he slept through that or what but I hope you don't miss it but I want to make sure you understand to what I'm saying and what I'm expecting cause as one firm believer you know in the message of the hour that we believe that and the Bible that we try to study from that you know we're living in the most marvelous day of all right they've never been a day as great as this day so why would anybody think it's what I went through where the Prophet would say the revival for America is over did you turn God down in 57 and you know it's over for America no more world wide sweeping revivals we'd like that that was right but didn't say to somebody you say something battle revived revivals are all over we don't believe in revival it's all over well then the Prophet said in the sealed book during the third seal he said the bride hadn't had a revival yet didn't take them seven unknown thunders to wake her up well then I hope you understood what I'm trying to bring see there's revivals revivals revivals the word brother Branham would have not he said we've had a great revival this week well that was just in that place but then he would talk about a revival and looking forward to the revival looking forward to something great to take place and I guess you think that all down to time and all of the things that has happened and all of the great revivals that has been and you think I guess we're just going to go out of here and rapture one day which is the greatest event or change of these bodies the greatest event that could be ever thought of the most important event event that could ever be thought of other than Calvary to make place a way for that to take place and to think that we're going to end this up by just turkey ology just by thoughts and ideas you know then you say well revived one angle minimal revival you just you just believe it in a revival you understeer the people up I would to God I could stir you up I would do God we could all get stirred up why not what's the problem but as I was trying to bring out now see each age I want to read all the scripture together everyone say a little bit see each age it came down according to what we read here in jaw and coming on through and knowing that it says there would be a form of rain and a lot of rain all right now that's a gospel that's not just rain pouring down that's natural to say it for over there you know for for planting Co when we planted the garden this time you know it was great we got some rain all right that's wonderful all right let's see now the there'll be many rains all the way through because that's not all oh but then they'll come a time that would be called the latter rain or the life's rain just as you're putting on your crops and they're beginning to grow and mature so you can get it up to certain sizes like corn and all as it begins to come in forming the corn on the to the to the cob you know it needs a rain and that would be a lot of rain right not to that that's a form of rain and a letter right right now it's never been and it's not anywhere that to fulfil jaw in the fulfillment of what he says until this day right now follow what I'm saying because he said they'd be a former and a lot of rain in the same month in the first month all right now don't run that is to say well the former rain would be this year in April cuz that's their first month and then next year in April little bit don't go that way that shows how smart you are but it doesn't show how intelligent you are this shows how smart ethically we can be to try to say things to make it look like we know something just why don't you put it like it is there's never been a place anywhere that you can cover former rain and lighter rain in the same month there is no crop that grows that away you don't plant one thing and then gather it within a month you know you don't even plant plants and get it your month you know you know you don't get that it's just not dark so it's showing you in the gospel the is taking that to bring it to this day as well read in a minute and come in this day is the only day that you'll ever have to work that you would have the form of rain and the latter rain in the same month we'll get to that in a minute now what is a Ryan it's a form of rain is the teaching rain right in the gospel now former rain is the teaching rain the planting of the word just like you would plant your seed into the ground all right yeah and then you get a little moisture on it but then latter rain is to reveal that or quicken that to you or to make it alive all right now the Lord Jesus spoke pains years ago two thousand years ago he spoke many things but it didn't come to Pais right then even though it was a form of rain but it's waiting to a time to quicken our harvest of that rain all right now so each church age and what I trying to get to the other day the each church age at a former rain which was the minister that you know like paul iranians paul martin Columba luther wesley elijah each age has a former rain a message that goes forward in each age had a ladder rain to quickening that that was taught by the messenger of that age all right and each age in itself now now that's where you're gonna have to listen too closely he's aging itself then had a revival are you going to say some of the ages didn't have a revival a year you're not knowing what a revival is you're thinking of a revival as to be a great outpouring a great shouting of great manifestations of great things that have taken place and that's fine but that's not a revival revival revival is not as we brought out the other day a revival is not for the center you can't revive a sinner a revival is for those that are in you already got a house something then you fall away and then you can be revived back to that are as we'll covered in it you can be restored because that's going to be what we're talking about today restoration brings revival run restoration brings revival all right now follow that down through all of the time and you can look back behind and see the pyramid and the ages and the messenger in the days of the Apostle Paul he had a teaching reign to the first church age which was his message all right and then God made that alive to the people of that age all right that was a lot of rain to that okay it was a quickening or making it alive to the people would you realize that that's been being made alive of what he said has been being made alive for 2,000 years right you read the Apostle Paul now and God quickened that and revealed it to you it's being made alive to you all right it's being brought into manifestation of reviving you and I because a revival of said it's not the center heat you get to people rejoicing and happy and getting them to come to the altar and repenting and crying out under God and that's why sinners start coming because they see what's taking place then the center comes and he gets saved all right did he becomes a part of the group all right and see that's the revival so do you understand what I'm saying ever Church aids had a row at a time that they received a message every Church age at a time that that message was made alive and that would be the revival of that day in that time all right and it would come down through the ages and then as it would it would come down to the life stage as we tried to bring out here while back about the ages and the thing it would come down to this age being a special age comes in this age now in this age typing as it would back when the children of Israel went into the land of Canaan you realize as they went into the land of Canaan they were actually reaping the harvest they didn't have to plant right they reap what was our but you realize they could turn around and plant immediately the muna they ate to natural land they could say with that all the old corn of the land because that's in the scripture right when they entered Egypt I mean you know when they went into the land of Canaan they're coming out of Egypt they ate of the old corner of the land right which is a deeper meaning of the word of God true is that that's your prophets explanation we see the only time that it could take place anything that would look that way would be when the Israel went into the promised land and they ate of the old corn there surely they were saying growing dire that they could eat but they didn't have to plant it but when they got there ate they ate the mature corn as we call it food of the land that had been stored up but then immediately they had to plant you see yeah but that's that's latter rain on the former and that's what the Prophet says me it has to come to a time that not only are you getting former rain teaching right and latter rain it comes to a time is you're going to get a lot of rain with a former right right it's in the basically discernments in case you miss it you want to know get it laying up here but I just want you to think about it me that each age had its own revival now follow me not necessarily a worldwide sweeping he's aged had revival for the message of that age of quickening of making live see that's the kind of revival I'm talking about I'm not talking about it we're wide sweeping revival to work everybody knows and all of the great things that took place Azusa Street was the last one of those to the Gentiles the two witnesses going to Israel there'll be a great revival we covered it even brother Otto said in the years of his ministry that he had a 15 year revival going on but he said it's going down and that was before the opening of the seal we'll get to that later on in the message but just think about it now how could it fall former and latter rain in the same month it would have to be a planting and quickening real quick right all right so watch that now now let's go back and read the scripture and pick up what is talking about and you'll see this pointing right down to this day alright follow it down to this time now look and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied goes back down to 23 be glad then your children of Zion which is the bride right we know this is natural Israel and he's speaking off right but that's the type of the Bride of Christ because we are their spiritual Israel we are the children of Zion all right said rejoice in the Lord for he had given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month right there's going to be a great thing happen in this life stage but what did we read in what we talked like when we're speaking like but run said to be so humble until you miss it I'm talking about a revival not that everybody in the building is running all over the place I'm talking about a reviving of the revealing of the word that you can sit right beside of somebody and God can be revival taking place in your heart and the person next to you know nothing about it that's the revival I'm talking about yet it will come to a great time now watch it in the Bible then come to a great time if we can't read it the scripture win that shape all right your calls to come down for you the rain the former's a lot of rain in the first month okay this is the only age that can take place because when it comes to this age God can sew down and reveal real quick where as I said about Paul look at Paul Paul spoke back dire these things fall Paul spoke that mankind has read about and preached about but has never come to Piyush right all said to be changed a moment at winking them and I dead in Christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain that hasn't taken place yet but what about when it can be preached in taking place and quicken it right then there's what we ought to be paying attention to well and when that happened look what he says and the floor shall be full of weak and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil like I said when children of Israel entered into Canaan land that's exactly what they found they were capable of taking and eating the old corner of the land read your scriptures I used to preach all of that we should probably said it's a deeper revelation and with God's Word you remember they had manna while they were in the wilderness you remember that manna fell every day in the wilderness but when they entered the land of Canaan and tasted to that old corn to land the manna ceased revival the manna ceased why because it become a stronger meat comparing it to the old corn of the land because it was in the land of Canaan so they could not only eat that bread but they could plant that bread that they could make bread out of they were capable of planting so now you got it all in the same month now you understand see then watch when they entered Canaan where it was it the floors were full of wheat and fat shall overflow with wine and oil now that happened naturally to Israel right it's got to happen spiritually to me and you when the rain comes in the same month to us all right now follow it now watch what he says now you're going to have all this rain you're going to and you're going to have the old floor into the wine and oil and he says and I will restore who you the years that the locust has eaten they can't go on the caterpillar the Palma worm my great army which I sent among in thanks talking about a restoration a restoration when would that take place they go back in the first part of Joel and you'll see that he says there's going to be a cackler in Palmer which is really you know yourself by looking at its four stages of one bug right it's the cankerworm Palma worm glow Krishna caterpillar it finally winds up to be a great beautiful butterflies we'd call it in the stages of the others the local but then it starts right back over and it's just a little bug it's the Esther that or the other right or to know that you know why I'm saying locust got it and watching he says my army which I sent among you now he didn't send the cankerworm pond warm locusts and caterpillar he allowed it to come he permitted it to come so don't go off and say God sent it that's not God's army who get the God's army in a minute that's not God's army he never said those things he permitted them to come into being to where they could be a time that he could restore it remember my thought restoration brings revival so thank now and look what he said during that time though he's talking about a restoring he talking about all this plant and all this other things about it then he starts to restoring to you order note is pointing down to this day are you following me and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that help dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed listen and during that time of restoration and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your odd and none else and my people shall never be ashamed look now what does it say when that comes to pious when it comes to pipes look what he said and it shall come to pass afterward after the restoration but now you're going to catch all and I hope what I'm talking about we're going to talk about a revival as being the restoring of the word but then we're going to get to see what it turns out to be in the end time where it can be in the same month so listen real careful and pay attention it shall come to pass afterward and I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions all right that took place to natural Israel of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit under their Pentecost to the natural Israel but then the cankerworm palm warm locust and the caterpillar came in right after revival I asked her the upper room experience after the five the three thousand after the Holy Ghost being poured out on the day of Pentecost then they can't come when palm warm locusts the caterpillar started and ate it down that's why it's promised in the last days huh look in this life stage what it's going to be and it shall come to pass afterward after the content can worm worm locusts the caterpillar has been put down after what they ate away has been restored then it's going to be bring it down to this day you can bring it down to where you can bring the Holy Ghost being poured out on those Oh sister and that's exactly right but remember they can't go wearing pom warm locust and Caterpillar we're concerned with if you'll read restoration the right tree you get the message that those bugs that we're concerned with is the ages where the denomination's ate it down and God would have to restore right so let's get down to where we're living Israel is only type of where we're living look and upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit now you get over in the scripture and said if well my handmaids and my servant are look and I'll show wonders in the heavens and the earth blood and fire coming down to where we're at now and fillers are smoke and the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord coming down to where we're at and it shall come to pass we're in the end time that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered or in Mount Zion Mount Zion has always been the bride and in Jerusalem which this message will go straight on the Israel when we leave out of here and they'll get their time she'll be deliverance as the Lord has said in the remedy and the Lord shall call a great day is promised the cankerworm pollen worm - locusts caterpillar all that to Israel forget that come down to where we're at read or listen to the message restoration of the bride tree and you'll hear him talking about what the message is left the Baptist say when two bad days left the Pentecostal a etc you talking about the cankerworm pond warmed locusts and Caterpillar being in our age and our time now what's that in a minute in our day in our time is where we're to be concerned with what happens to Israel that Rapids of Israel we remember all of that is going to happen to Israel when they are restored they're going to have a great revival of a restoration right why would he say I will restore the years of the locals come because it means they came and ate away and the restoration is going to come as each church age had a message that I started off each church age had a message down to time they've always had a gospel they've always had a quickening of that I'm making a live of the word of that age and that was their revival that didn't stop the great revivals for coming that only spoke of it showing what would take place in Paul's day they can't go whereupon worm low because the caterpillar hadn't got started yet it was just started in his day to eat it down but it has been restored in this day in restoration don't bring revival what are you talking about would it not be satisfactory to us as Christians to believe that in the days of the Apostle Paul that he could stand out and speak and God could reveal the secret things that were hidden before the world to those people and that would be so great until it still is taking place today George it was a revival in the days of Paul for you to hear his message and God revealed to you what are you talking about get in your Hebrew series get rid of that on the Godhead and the things and study your Bible and listen to Paul as he's bringing those signs and remember he's bringing it back dark but it's still taking place today the revival and I listened you understand what I'm getting at the revival I'm talking about started with the Lord Jesus preaching the gospel the latter rain started by the Holy Ghost quickening that on the defini coast and making that word alive and the people's heart right that's the greatest revival that's the revival I want all the other revivals see that does away with all of that emotional shouting and glory hallelujah as you call a revival you can work that up amongst people any time right like we were talking about life night the fivefold ministry there's a lot of you that a minister comes in a different ministry from what I use and you're so happy and clapping and shout at a minute tolerance and when I preach you go we know what that don't make me upset you might think it does it no because see I happen to know people and what causes you to kick so just remember shout all you want to now quote the Prophet which is make sure you walk straight when you come down right shouting glory hallelujah I have mine I don't have to show it all the time I have my rejoicing but nobody knows it with me he said well why don't you try to get us to rejoice well when you get what I'm talking about and you catch on to what I'm talking about that the opening of the word is the greatest revival that could ever happen to anybody in this world the opening of the word will raise the dead heal the sick and do all kind of thing your shout and glory hallelujah won't do it you say are you acknowledge that's where you go at it see you say well brother Dale you don't believe in being emotional you're wrong and one day you'll find it out I spoke times here from this pulpit to try to get you to see and then I withhold from speaking why it's like I was telling them last night the different ministries at God uses brother phone he's not counted to be a prophet he's an evangelist but God can use any ministry the way he wants to out of the five fold right and use them for one time and then they'd not have to work the mower ride I've told you God told me that brother Anderson and sister Anna was going to have a baby I didn't tell nobody why don't you go tell it if this God is going to come to PI then I don't have to worry about it and if you don't believe that something takes place and I walk out here and I say the Lord showed me that to eSchool oh he's just trying to prop up like he trying to make it look good I don't believe he done advise you I'd go somewhere else because I'm a liar it's not true and you would not be following a liar is that sensible if that's the way you think about the ministry you ought to go somewheres out but see the Lord showed me that and I never said a word that nobody never said a word to brother for me where the phony got then anointing under it and got the preaching real good that night and he turned and walked down the aisles write about some where brother Aaron to that and our stood brother and sister Anderson the story was brother Anderson's firm count was so low until he couldn't have any children they'd been told that they go to the same doctor I go to I mean I'm screwed they're their family doctors my my doctor I talked to him about them brother poni walked right down the aisle and he stopped and he said God is going to give you that baby and you know what the baby came I don't have to have all of that yeah but if you'd have told it we could have been happy no you wouldn't believe it no more you wouldn't believe it in the moon if you tell us what no you wouldn't leave it come on let me tell it why not leave it alone I've got something right now that the Lord showed me and I'm waiting for it to be made manifest but then what it is I'll tell you about it if you don't believe it then you wouldn't believe it if I told you for it happened that's the little things we were into the ministry life because listen what am I talking about what's a revival Rodela revival to come we're all shout and glory hallelujah and we're running the hill just that's a Pentecostal revival can unquote run around him he said well we over no no you're wrong when you say I don't believe in it I've told you things that happening but do you believe it I told you when the Lord told me he was going to give them a deer to where I could talk to it you've got to hang on his wall down to this house you're gonna go by that and look at it I told you about how as I sitting up on a deer stand way back in the woods and here comes this smelling perfumes or wonderful down through the woods and I get all plum upset about it I did I said Here I am Lord trying to have way to do something where I can talk with him and showing this you leading and then here I'm trying to hunt and hear some crazy female he's out here in the woods spraying perfume all over the place I'm serious I'm not always knowing what's right you know what I've done I got down off the trees and I laid my deer stand down and I laid down on the ground and I pouted for an hour or so and then when they come up Walt overlooking the back of a truck the big old beer distilled back of it up I looked at my brother my aunt said where'd you get it at he said I didn't get it he said Wade got it how do you think I felt me asking God to do something he's doing it the whole time and then me satin imparting and feuding about it because it didn't happen my leg you'll find out one of these days God don't do to our ways we do to his why can't you believe that a revival sure if shouting sure that's what I'm getting to come on get to the end of the message and we'll back up and what does it say after the cankerworm pommel worms locusts the caterpillar is eating it down to bug he's going to restore that then after it's restored he's going to send an outpouring of the holy spirit is that what I've always taught you brother branham said after the door the Gentile church is closed God willing knowing a church and doing one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 but he said he's doing it now why cause revivals were taking place that's why you can't follow brother Branham and ended unless you get it put together running in the latter rain this afternoon to sit down for a while and read all the things he says he'll tell you the Pentecost word had a ladder rain you'll tell you the Baptist was having the ladder running you tell you always having a ladder right but then he'll turn around and say you say latter rain spoken word read mercy he says you had the former running yet he talking about something else right that word of those seals and things came after what we're reading the seco to remember what he said in there as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled it had to be a sewing name come on I quote with him he said the world has been soaked down these are the denomination has sewed it down he said and the word has been sewn pure and unadulterated from any denomination is that only spoken word Regency didn't read that lately I'd invite you to at least listen to it he says I have yet Malakoff over we see Malachi for then had to be so damned what do you think brother I'm done the revealing of that that he's so down is your lighter rain with the Bible said remember the other day asked of rain in the latter rain that's raining like crazy yesterday right day before it's rain like everything here and then you stand out the artsy Lord sending some rain I don't sound too good does it sounds like you kind of mixed you marbles somewhere up Stars not what the Bible says asked of rain in the time of the latter rain it didn't say of the time of the former why can't you believe and expected rather unsaid he said one of these days they'll come such an outpouring from heaven that'll fill every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture I've been quoting that fifty years wanting somebody to catch it that's why I said I've been in the greatest revival ever since I've been in this message I've been in a constant revival I'd like for places with some of you ever once in the one that wouldn't sometimes I'll go brother Gary Atkins we used to talk a lot because he kind of experienced that you ever been at the time when you go for two or three months and you don't feel the presence of God you ever been that way if you go for a while don't feel the presence of God you won't try preaching every Sunday with that kind of a feeling you're welcome to have it you want to try preaching when you don't feel its presence and all he gives you is one word and you preach for months and months and months and the best you can get out of it hey brother Dale this repeats itself you better believe I do and you better believe I'll keep on do it cause you know another one to walk up and say brother Dale keep on repeating cuz winters repeat income I finally get what you're talking about well now which one of my folks listen to you see what a revival is to me the revival is receiving God's Word and it being quickened into my heart rejoicing outward emotions is what you're calling a revival come on I can quote to you know I can quote a man that was sitting on the pulpit looking at a lady outside and she was shouting like every time you remember your prophet telling that he said I was gonna get down and go down there and set her down you remember that one do you remember the rest of the story when he went down to set her down he got to shouting - he's like I've done that lanta one time this brother said something I've seen he was running around around in the church and he every time he appreciates run around you know really red-nosed him because are you sitting next to him and he just you know Peter a just I said brother just don't stop I might run into you he said but I've never seen you most of you ain't never seen the emotion you never see me sit down a gun was standing 20 feet away me rejoicing over what God had revealed to me see revival is not the outward emotional thing that's what you call the revival the revival is the restoration of God's Word inside of you that will outwardly produce emotional things about it what do you expect see people think a revival is a great rejoicing and like I said you mean to tell me that you don't believe in emotions you mean to tell me I've been quoting that for years it read around and said God will pour out of there's a blessing upon us one day and fill every fiber of our beings you mean we're not going anywhere to go and set that glow - hallelujah that's why I wonder does he ever to reveal yourself to you I'm sorry if I'm sitting back are you'd buy the right get up here and say the same thing to me you can't tell by the emotions on people's face where the God's revealing things are not the one you think is not getting it might be the one that's getting and the rest of them are not getting come on we got the old shoulder on you take a wagon old wagon you go out in the field and boy it makes a lot of racket don't it clanging the bang which you load it down with good watermelons and you come pulling that load of watermelons you got very little racket so maybe the load and down of the wagon might be better off than the going on car empty-handed what are you following the layout of the scriptures the layout even to Israel is what the cankerworm pom world locust and Caterpillar going to be restored to Israel one day that's been eating away and when it is they're going to have a revival it's going to be a rejoicing now listen how long is it going to be rejoicing to Israel and a revival you don't think I thought according to my understanding and a three and a half year period that 144,000 we're all going to be killed you don't have much choice revival going on when you get them killed for what you believe course you know how people believe that that's where I was reading that we're gonna set our Creed's and their dogmas and things is what's keeping the revival away you remember that all for the see a book when we've read it look great man in this message set one day and talking to me and he told it in the church he said that 144,000 ain't gonna be killed I said well according to your prophet that you claim he said that I'll be killed and according to the Bible it says they'll be killed but you know one the people sitting around never heard that they still believe brother so-and-so well then that kind of person ain't gonna have a revival I'm talking about I'm talking about a restoration a restoration a restoration that would restore all things and then you tell me that's not a revival a restoration what does that say you got the locusts came upon worm caterpillar is it true off a restoration of the bride tree the Prophet said what for death messengers took it down cankerworm pond worm locust caterpillar got it laying here if you want to read it matter of fact you can go ahead and pull it up you want to pull it up on the restoration of rod tree and let him just repart it while I'm talking they said for death messengers ate it down he said for life - injures will restore it What did he say those life messengers were he said Luther was one of them the just shall live by faith was a life messenger to restore he said Wesley was a life messenger to restore because he brought sanctification he said Pentecostal with the gifts and the baptism of the Holy Spirit was the number three and he said in the number four is what the word now if you have one and two and don't have number three it's not too good right you've now justification and sanctification and not how the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're not very much valued right in the Lord but if you have justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring you to a new birth and then the word comes you've got the capability of understanding and how to grow into the statue of a perfect man right though the years of the cankerworm Palmas and locust and Caterpillar would see you won't listen to the restoration of Rhodri the way I do because I can read you the direct quotes or what I just said is justification same face the baptismal goat and then the word and then brother random turns around and he says what the mess that is left the Baptist ate what the Baptist left the Pentecost was eight he's bringing another four stages of the bug that's not in the dark ages into coming down when it went into the ground he's bringing it into our day of the preachers and the people of this message that are cutting this message to pieces it's not too messy this church this time it's the Methodist doctrine it's not the Baptist Church it's a Baptist doctrine you take any of these doctrines you want to we'll talk about it all afternoon any of these doctrines you've gotten a message if you'll give me a little time we're thinking it'll come out to show you that some denomination had that idea the Mormon doctrine of pre existence is identically to the SIB to soul doctrine that the people of this message that are big portion of we're blinded by that of the true soul doctrine you've got a lot of people in this message that live really low shouting glory hallelujah and that's wonderful but that's the message this idea you got a lot of them just dry hide and don't believe nothing that's a good Lutheran or pinnacle or Presbyterian or something not even that Presbyterian they was more emotional you see one gone man see it's this message then as this message has been sold down in your heart from the message of the hour and the fivefold ministry bringing that message so that was the question was a flight now how did the fivefold ministry fit into the perfecting of the Saints I said because they're supposed to preach what the Prophet preached and they preach what the Prophet pretended to bring together then the opening of the word and that's the greatest revival that we could want the greatest revival that could ever be it was how much the other day in Hosea when he said after two days he said in the third day see you try to figure that out you probably put third day and you'd be mathematically off when you go back to what the Prophet said that third day started when Hosea said it which was 780 BC so you're right now in the third day from Hosea and he's promised a brides revival a bride to be taken out of here and Israel to receive their message restoration brings you back to the faith of the fathers that right restoration brings you back to the full restoring of the Word of God now listen to what I'm saying then where would you follow by trying to cover the word then because the word never fell away in the last days like we're saying word fell away back down under this restored under luther wesley and the baptismal holy ghost look at the people of this message that's destroying the Word of God by their ideas and their quotes it surely needs a restoration it needs to be restored back to us what the Prophet is saying but yet who wants what the Prophet is say it restoration brings a revival that's what it said here in jaw closed after that time it says I'll pour out my spirit on all flesh what are you expecting brother Dale I'm expecting two things to get worse and worse and worse as we go along in the natural but you mean I thought it out for 50 almost 50 years ministry and then come down in the end time and one of cabbies down to some kind of a little thing and not believe the full Word of God I'm looking for a revival in the people's heart of this word that has been preached by the prophets and brought unto us and to be brought by the fivefold ministry and he said I'm breaking it down in big nuggets and I'm gonna let the ministry take it and bring it on down now that's his words you said but we don't need the fivefold ministry I can get it by myself show me the Bible I challenge that on the basis of God's Word out there on the internet or anywhere in the world send me a quote send me a word and says you can get it yourself without the fivefold ministry you say you shouldn't talk like that why not show it to me you can't find it coated ain't docker the Bible says the fivefold ministries for the perfecting of the same that's what you're not looking at it like we did last night you realize the fivefold ministry is not non spiritual guilt anybody can operate in a non spiritual guilt with the fivefold ministry is a predestinated guilt to the church to bring her to perfection those don't believe it okay time with me and the problem like I said it don't bother me for you to shout when all these four for the preaching and their preaching simple things and you shouting about it then I preach and you don't child that don't bother me it just knows for sure one thing you ain't catching what I'm talking about so when you catch on well I'm talking about with both shout we'll have a good time well what do you think only end up then when the word is fully restored to the bride of Jesus Christ according to Joel when the word is fully restored in other words when this message is revealed to the bride of Jesus Christ is a full restoration back to not just the face of the father's but back to the Lord Jesus Christ and the word he brought which was six seals in Matthew 24 that's got to be restored not restored in the basis that it was here to start with no but in the restoration it's going to be brought back to you and I so why call it restoration because technically it's not restoration because technically it was never here are you with me technically it was never here nobody ever preached anything about the seals oh there were people that read times and said we bad this had the sixth seal I'm going to sit in on in the sixth chapter of Revelation we had the six sealing knew that that was a Tribulation Period would you read down but are you following me restoration is to bring back what was formerly here now can you understand what I've tried to say it's in 1969 when the first message I preached was the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man the Word made flesh in a mini membered body that your prophet said would be and he said the Godhead is not complete without you why can't we believe that we then is to restore what Jesus had not did it fell away because nobody didn't know anything about so now let's call it another word let's don't call it restoration of the message of the hour to bring the seals to the right of Jesus Christ let's don't call it restoration let's call it revival come on let's call it revival when the faith of the fathers were preached back by the property that was restoration that don't mean everybody understood it was our ain't talking about it then he went home to fulfil Malachi 4 because there's another part of Malachi 4 first part was to turn the hearts of the children back the second part was what reveal those seven thunders which is contained in the seals in his divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn this back so Jesus is ministry of the seals was never here until the Prophet preached you know he preached yourself nobody preached in between you followed me so that's not in restoration it's in a revival you at least grinned or shook her head or said something when I said Paul started off with a messenger to his age and his message was a form of rain and then to quicken it to the people would be calling it latter rain you remember that when I first started that Paul each church aged messenger had a message that's a form of rain and the people caught that message and it was a lighter rain that day are you listening you're not shaking head you might be condemned because remember you our own video buys you I just shape it up sometimes because I've instructed them back there too every once in a while scan the audience wouldn't be good brother dick when you got that on the right man what about when you sound asleep they turn that video around and are you this call and your own internet around or you are the things you brothers have stand up here and new brothers at any singing anything or anybody you ought to think about what you're saying because you're on internet okay what you see Church this message are you listening the message that the Prophet brought which was his message to begin in 63 when he said not in the years of preparation and all these other fight he said but when he begins to say on there's no restoration to them because it was never here mankind never told him why don't you call it a revival why don't you call it planting of the word and how they can come in the same month and how you can listen to a tape and right there right while you're listening God can quicken what is being said there's your former and latter rain in the same month the same time now it can be fulfilled not restoration not Reclamation's why don't you call it a revival long brothers why don't you call it a revival and say brothers I'm having a revival because that's what brother Dale is talking about I'm talking about it this message goes forth in God quickens it I am being revived as you become part of the word now let's see them to get it Easter seal you become the word as you receive the word this message they brethren brought to us his message is not a restoration it's a revival it's the Word of God coming straight from God's lips not the man God's lips in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it begins to sound the mystery of God that will be completed it's the same thing as Moses words when he walked out there he had the message right he spoke the message and it took place right he didn't have to say what somebody else said he had the message the prophets message began in the opening of those seals and went through I'll give you the quotes of it not in the years of the healing the message it followed the healing the greatest ministry that has ever struck the world started in this 63 somewhere right in there I back up a little bit 62 similar as he began to head in towards his message and as you begin to bring his message that message had never been preached by anybody but the Lord Jesus Christ that was what he whipped to top off and looked down in all of those statements the gospel struck the world not as a restoration now quote it but as a prophet saying I say unto thee is that what he was doing that message straightened out all the errors and things that the Prophet had called in his early ministry through the opening of the seals and they're coming down and there was the message of the song man you remember back a few months ago when I was preaching about it's a son of man there's the only solar of the seed you realize brother branham so due to the end time as a gospel there's got to be my life if not why do you bring it well that ain't for us like a big man this message that said that third pulling things said that that's only for her brother branham and the Lord Jesus will then glory hallelujah that sure leaves the rest of the world I out don't I don't agree with that I want you to know what I don't agree with it I want you to know that I believe that when this message is fully made alive in you and I they'll come a baptism of the Holy Ghost to prove that word is right when the Lord Jesus had preached his message he told them to go to the upper room and wait shut up don't preach don't do nothing set up a lake then the Holy Ghost came and he says now I send you of the world with a message that a message which was a revival in their heart when is this message going to become a revival to you you see why the ended okay let Stan what is a revival it's a person that the word has been made alive to the shouting glory hallelujah is a manifestation of that is that right the shouting glory hallelujah is not the revealing of God's Word it's supposed to be a manifestation because of the word being revealed I hope you listen oh yeah it's a little Christmas song Wendy joy to the world [Music] better PC her team let every retire and heaven in nature what about it a revival and then an outpouring to prove you didn't revise with me just remember the world will be shouting - you think they're sounding your secret is sounding God leave only thing I didn't finish but I want to make a final statement because it says there about this time of rejoicing one he said I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters my run said God is on one of them my sons and daughters my but he said the other is the devil's children now listen in the upper room when the Holy Ghost failed there was a hundred and twenty true seed Judas had done left he's off the same it wasn't the Devils children and God's children in the upper room back dire it's the last days when he pour out his spirit upon all flesh so there'll be a great revival take place you watch it there's little flare-ups every once in a while little little things happens they would one down here in Florida a few years ago that they had revivals for two or three years just service after service that's the one that it's kind of understand you started rejoicing and you started having a good time and people gonna come see the fire burning and you know what they might get happy you say you're looking for the world I'll go to random said and even Israel would see God come in for the bride and they would think that he's coming after them which said wrong time any time then you mean you think it's going to be a worldwide sweep and revival you let America get desperate and she'll go to her knees as it goes through knees God's going to send a revival but it's not far them remember a revival is not for those that are lost a revival is for those that are born again the true Bride of Christ will be having the great revival the others will be shouting in the aftereffect listen I'm 77 years old I walked in a Baptist Church in short range and remember as a kid of how people would be crying out for God to bring a revival I've seen women walk down into woods not out like we do you know and get down walk out in the woods for chicks and sugars and snakes and everything was dark down behind the cemetery on one side and the men on the other and crying out for God to save the people you know what we was doing we were shouting in the after effects of the Pentecostal revival that was done dying down well they'll shout one day but it won't be far then it'll only be for the little bride because she'll know why she shout listening to a tape the other day where brother Brennan said those poor brothers he called his brother's name when I won't do it but he said that poor brother said he went down and preached in that Catholic Church right what he called it to synagogue he said that priests come over the priest and his church that sounds good I've done it you know what he said he said it's wrong you say don't go out there and preach to them now he didn't do that remember at the same time he said what he said he was going to the denominational churches and preaching to him so don't get you smart attic brain to running just listen that man was trying to get them people to join together with him both sides was trying to get him joined together it wasn't just Rutter Branham going to a preacher and preaching in a church he was doing that every day he wasn't against that he was against what that man was do it because that man was joining the two together you mean if they call me up and they say brother Dale we want you to come up here and preach for us I'll be glad to go anywhere any denomination Catholic whatever oh and Carol go preach fun but when they said okay now let's just kind of compromise a little bit let's get this and we'll come out and preach for you too no way all that the way you see the whole world is going to experience the religious world is going to experience your revival but it'll only be the shot and glory hallelujah for them but to the bride she'll be going right down the road and she'll walk off here you know there's a go right on can I quote the prophet claiming to receive the Holy Ghost is that the way he said it did he say that they'd go on claiming to receive the whole to go after the rapture has taken place and said there'll be some little something will happen and said they'll say but we thought this was going to take place and said there'll be a little voice speak and say it's happened and you missed yet let's go to all the bread around go in that one anybody have a need they said that third verse no more no sorrows about anybody having a hold on the altar dope do you understand what I'm talking about a revival a revival in my heart has the thirdly opening shot work far as the curse is found far as far as the Kurtz is bound he rules the world with truth and grace and makes the nation's prove the glories of all right revelation 1:1 she has a friend that has a tea thrown off so we ask you to go and take care of it take care of an airship somebody else is just having a ho more let's play on and sorrows grow we have a real our once here the ground he comes to make his blessings flow his forest words is back as far as the curse is back as far as accursed is attitude in no morelets in or sorrows grow no more since one need salvation in the soul the other signs are okay maybe need to Lord plan because then what is in the heart are brothers it is see Jesus pass Horace we're thank you we believe it in anybody else's down your brother on it no revival is that way I thought you greatly your Synology you get to work and resilience there's no sense hanging or dried compassion [Music] being crashed joy do the routing we don't take them we take what you say committed in religion everything will be all right within him and if that's anything else is he won't we committed to you in Jesus name anybody else before we go Father we thank you for the day and we ask that what we said has been worthy the Lord we at least get it off our heart in their mind it won't be bothering us anymore Lord it's left into your hands to reveal it unto us because I pray that what we've brought is your word and the line up is through your word and we believe it Lord we're looking forward to a time that you can manifest yourself among us but Lord we're looking at the time now as we're having a wonderful time in thy word as it's being revealed to our hearts and souls Lord that's what's changing us that's what's reviving us and then after it's all finished they will be a great marvelous time take place but yet if we're not ready it won't be for us but just make us ready against that day we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you're dismissed woman I should make his word don't said woman don't you worry God sent me today and before you even asked him helpers on the way just hold on a little longer help is on the way better time is coming
