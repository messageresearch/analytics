TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Eyes of My Heart beat love foreign remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday at brother pageants and if you want to go along we'll all try to get together and ride up I mean you may have to take your car because we've invited others to go with us too so you'll try to get everybody together and get there you know have a good time in the Lord so just remember that I know you already have but remember little Deanna and remember Abby both of them were sick when Indiana's got strep throat and they're what they call it you know and just just remember her and praise the Lord with would take it all away amen tonight we're gonna try I don't know that's what I got enough questions to go so far but not enough questions to go the whole thing so we will just read our scripture and see if anybody has anything on your heart from here uh if not I may try to preach something so that we'll go one way or the other you know whatever it would do if you like turning your scriptures turn to Matthew 19 where we've been reading and from Romans 7 Matthew 19 Romans 7. are dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for an opportunity of coming out tonight and thank you for for me and you and revealing yourself unto us Lord that we may see you by the opening of our eyes Lord we know we can't open our natural eyes without strength from you and neither can our spiritual lives be open without you doing it farce Lord we thank you for all things we thank you for the testimony we heard tonight and we pray that you would just blessed each one and encourage us all to seek after you and to want to be gathered together in your love as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives Lord that we may see you and want to walk in your grace and your love remember the come on this he said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe that you'll do that unto us tonight have your way now in Jesus name amen 19. we'll read three through nine and then we'll go to Romans 7 and we meet okay the Pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying I drew him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he actually didn't show them to them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they shall they Twain she'll be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh but therefore God hath joined together let not and put asunder they say unto him why did Moses then command to give her writing a divorcement and to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you who shall say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and she'll marry another committed to the adultery this will marry her which is put away does commit adultery now if we get this far According to which way we go okay Romans seven will you not brother and for I speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth but the ones which happened husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'll be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress whenever her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she has no adulteress so she be married to another man or for my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law now how that being dead try we're in we were hail in other words now the only way you can be delivered from the law is to be dead yeah right right I mean that frees you from the law okay now they can't arrest my daddy for something he died in 1945 see we kind of hard to make a cash against him now well because he's dead all right but now we are delivered from the law that being dead we're in we were held that we should serve in a newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the Lord have his blessings to the reading of the word now let me ask you because it'll determine what we do does anybody have any more questions I have a few and do you have any comments questions or something that you'd like to write down in for us to cover tonight you know in what we're doing and all so uh you know if not we'll try to Maybe cover these and then maybe it'll stir up something in you but I'm just asking you if you have anything then that way we can we can uh cover those points of interest of what we've been doing with and what we've been talking about now we have been talking about marriage and divorce we've been talking about what is a marriage it is what this when a girl a boy asked a girl to marry she accepts they're married all right then what is a divorce to break that wording that you've made it's not to go down to the justice of the peace that's the natural Act of things that are taking place are to the court you know Etc whatever you would have to go to uh that would be uh doing it but it's basically just to break your vow that you made to one another all right you see then in doing that then we covered in our life's message that uh you know there was no grounds for her whatsoever to divorce her husband and to remarry because that would would be contrary to the scriptures but it's not said about him and uh not being said about him then we had to find out what would be the things or what how could a man you know have a right to put away his wife and and marry again what would be the grounds or what would be the the uh the points and we tried to cover that from there in uh Matthew of 19 and 9 and um Matthew 5 32 where we were talking about that one says that if man puts away his wife except Matthew 19 9 it be for fornication and marriage again he'll commits adultery all right then we went through Matthew 5 32 it says saving for the cause all right so there's no grounds that the man can just come along and say I can just put my wife away for anything all right now if you don't agree with me on what I'm preaching about it that's up to you uh I've preached this for 40 years and I've stood with it on the grounds of what I believe and you know I continually stand on that ground it's not something to just any cause of anything oh my God I forget to turn or something oh I hope you don't turn this up oh okay right yeah okay we get the right lid on the right jug we're all right maybe I made it you just pray for us children so coughing and hacking and everything else but don't worry about it all right but it's good to see sister Trudy here on Wednesday night that's that's something for her to get to be down this way where she can be here in the Wednesday night services and praise the Lord for that okay we've been praying about that for what how many years you've been coming here 20 something years and she's been praying for to come down this way now she's down here so we thank God for that right all right let's see what is the grounds now that the man can put away his wife it can only be because saving and accept is the same word using we gave the definitions we gave the understanding and it's not just because that she's this or she's that we went through it that the only grounds is for the fact of fornication all right then we went through from from that of fornication saying that the people of the message uh they accept fornication as being uh before marriage you know and you could put away your wife and Mary again which we gave a couple of quotes for that you know that it wrote around said it could be done and she told you 10 years after they were married you could you know the man could do that all right but then uh you know as we were going along then uh I told you I said there's not a quote you see you're saying you're self-interpreting your thoughts on the message no I'm just telling you what I believe amen amen if if you don't agree with it that's all right because we gave where the Prophet said adultery fornication what could be the same word he gave the definition of fornication as being a girl before marriage you know and adultery as being uh someone that is married and runs around with a man you know and that's adultery all right but then we went back to show the connections and I hope he was following it of how that brother Brown said eve committed adultery well now you know they had never come together they had never been to the point of of what we label on our thoughts a lot of times being married so they had never come together that way and but he calls it adultery and he called it adulterer with Israel you know the Bible did and and that's you know our adulterous uh mother is what it is and we go over to Babylon and all the things you know and we can find it as would be an interchangeable word now I say then because I've made my statement I for to be what I say I believe adultery and fornication is an interchangeable word I know the definition of it and what it means but still adultery is fornication right because fornication means unclean living all right so then it would be you know fornication and adultery would be interchangeable and you know if you say well give me a quote I've told you told you that 40 years ago I searched the message and I can't find a quote for a brother around and says that you can put your wife away for committing a dog treat and marry again no I don't mind saying it that way because I'll try to tell you like it is but then when you come down to the point of seeing it you meet a man that can put his wife away for committing fornication because she comes and tells him because it's a lie and then she goes out and lives in adultery you know that he can't put her away and marry again well then God couldn't put Israel away in Mary again all right he couldn't put Luther in him away we gave the quote that he put the lutherans away and married to methodists all right because now we're bringing it over closer to a spiritual point of understanding then we're trying to hold it at the natural point of understanding but you know still I've tried to bring that down into show and to show that fornication then goes on down into unclean living we went through that why would a prophet then say that you can't just put your wife away for anything because she's an unbeliever or something he said Paul covered it that wouldn't be correct we gave her all of that all right and then she turned around and and say that for a woman to cut her hair it's fornication all right because she's dishonoring her husband which is her head and by that she just honors Christ which is his head and we went through that to show him you know that that that that would be then brother random wouldn't be saying like the Pharisees what we just put them away for anything well see it looks like he come over here and brought around this or well you you can't put away with this that the other may burn into bread but you put away cutting a higher won't somebody come along so well that's just about anything ain't it no it ain't no it's fornication amen see because you're an untrue wife I gave where the Prophet said you know those things but you cannot now for a woman cutting her hair you cannot put her away and marry again I gave two quotes of that to show him and you know if you misunderstood me and thought I said other things that was the way you go back and listen to the tape that the statement is there there's two quotes were brought around and says you cannot remarry because of putting your wife away for cutting her hair all right so you you you can't do that that's that would go out it's got to be the natural part but yet the spiritual part of fornication is so close right until it's real you know run around discerned out remember the brother that time and thought he was running around on his life and to come find out he's playing around with organized religion and see then that's how close it is to coming down to a a situation amen Mark now then in covering that then we see that it's not for just anything it's for fornication and run around said you can put her away you know for cutting her hair but he said if you want to Paul said now the unbeliever desires to live with you so that's fine you know we went through that coverage she desire to live we naturally she's a woman of the world she's going to be out cutting her hair and doing things you know because she's an unbeliever this year go ahead you see but see Adam had that situation that he could have done but yet he didn't force the situation and God was so lenient with Israel until he over and over and over extended his arm of Grace unto her amen and so has he done it down through the ages of extending that Grace to mankind whether it be Luther Wesley Pentecost whatever it be you know to show that point but you know we found and flatly determined that there's no grounds for her to divorce her husband and remarry now we went through it so we got a couple of points that we can cover that will go in there and I went through it to explain you know sometimes so let's just take a couple of the questions and then if we go through questions and we get tied up we'll go on if we don't we'll we'll try to cover a little bit of the talk because the Lord showed me something the other day awake to explain what I see and uh you know that'd be a preacher to do that to know what are you talking about he said well if you see it say it you know in putting that into words what you see in your heart all right but now here's the question so we'll get into uh some of the Natural Life can a woman divorce her husband not for the bases or the point that she wants to remarry but she can separate from him because of his wrongdoings all right he doesn't give her a right to get married again now go get that plane okay she doesn't have a right to marry again but she don't have to live in that situation amen I gave you the quote from Brother Brown said if you know you you either partner that I would be saying you know well you know I'm not going to put up with you going to church over there he said and you do what God leads you to do that all right and see the woman she don't have to live with a man that's beating her up and and doing all kind of things and treating her so dirty if you don't have to live with him she can separate from it amen but because of the situation in the garden and who started it it doesn't give her a right to go get married the only ground she has is according to Romans 7 and according to the prophet of this day that we believe that her husband must be dead and that cannot be now that she becomes up and said well I'm a Christian so he's dead no no he still is it you got a problem he's still living so don't jump on the things and try to justify this or do that we're just trying to cover because really most preachers would most preachers would never say the things I've said through this series I'm not bragging I'm talking playing because they won't try to attempt to rectify things or get it in the right place just like they'll say well I I show you wherever I said you put her away for fornication but I can't show you where you put away for adultery so they just won't say those things all right well see I've always just been playing enough to tell you right and then you wouldn't verifying most of them saying that a woman could separate from her husband they tell her no you got to live with them you got to live with them you know I didn't get personal here if you want to that a pastor in another church was telling a person that goes to this church then she had to go back and live with her husband because he wanted to I told her you don't have to do it not what he's doing right all right that judge's gonna be on me and I told the brother I said you need to stay out of this situation if he hears his tape let it be but I told him but plainly I said you need to stay out of this because you don't know the whole story he said well I'm trying to get him converted I said yeah I've tried for a long time to get him converted too but I said you need to stay out of it because I'm telling it see and I told her I said you don't have to live in that condition so then we got some questions that'll relate to that and we can cover part of it and and do whatever to do it all right the question it's I don't know I'm divided it in uh about five just six different parts but it all kind of ties together so just listen if the husband commits adultery continuously what step can the wife take now if the husband continually commits adultery what step can the wife take separate from it right I mean I swear I'll believe it I don't believe she's got to live in that garbage now especially today when he's out there running around and brings all kind of venereal diseases and and AIDS and everything else home to her right now I don't agree with that at all I don't care who out there hears it you know and you send me email do what you want to that's just plain old me I was raised an old and stubborn way and I'm still stubborn I guess but I'm just playing about it too so you show me in the Bible word no now you come and show me in the Bible the prophets message whether the woman's got to live with a man that's out running around all over the country and that today like getting venereal diseases to bring it home to his wife now don't give her no grounds to get married again so keep on I'll keep saying that over and over but she don't have to live with him right if he beats her up he does things wrong to her she don't have to live with it well what's she gonna do brother Dale she didn't get a legal separation a legal separation from him and demand the court to make him pay child support Etc well she can't get child support unless she divorces him that's very close you know very close but see Church we're talking as I tried to bring out the other day this marriage and divorce situation is not talking about the world right it's not the people of the world right it's not the people of denominationalism marriage and divorce has never been offered to nobody but to the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right and that's been here in the end times it wasn't brought down Through the Ages and only spoke of it amen the grace of Salvation spoke of a Grace to come on marriage and divorce yes but it was not granted until the end time there's only granted three times that's Moses Hall and brought around to you and I in the end time to straighten it all up and I told you the reason it was granted is because we got to get these bodies straight amen that's right see now we believe well we're going to give us a new body we don't have to worry about it so it's going to be this body all right now watch Step can the woman take if her husband continually commits adultery I say she can withdraw herself from him get out you say well horror where can she go well there's a lot of offerings free things nowadays to take care of a lot of that stuff and a lot of good laws today take care of him all right and I would be the first one to stand up if somebody went with it I'll go right with you to court and say this is the grounds this is what she's talking about because it would be the wrong time now that's why I just have to make it plain and what can I do you know now the next part part of it it says that Shepherd if she does sheep or take of his sin by taking him back you know the first part was what grounds could you do all right does she partake of his sin by taking him back well I'm just on it playing honest whether you like it or not if my wife went out and run around with somebody she would have to have a test done before me and her would go back as husband and wife and I think the man the same way you know what kind of test I mean she would be tested for all kind of venereal diseases and you know and all this AIDS and everything else and I think the man ought to do that right if one of your sisters going to told me he said my husband's confessed or wrong to me what should I do I said tell him to go to the doctor and get a test number one because we don't you can surely be not partaker of his sin like you take heart but you be partaker because you're going to be wind up with AIDS out of the old guy or some kind of a narrow disease huh is that too plain or is it the truth what do you think about it does she partake of his sin by taking him back not not get the point we settled out about the venereal disease that's known and I said okay now let's get down to this point she you can forgive them and take them back you're not partaking of their sin right right you're not taking part of her of the person's sin whether it be woman or man I mean so then you're not taking on yourself some sinful thing if your husband said forgive me and you forgave them and took him back or the wife should forgive me you took her back then you're not partaking of their sin you're not guilty of what they were guilty of right amen the only thing you do is that's it partake of the natural thing and it would cause a problem but you you you're it wouldn't be that you're partaking of that you're it it don't come fall back on you it's on them and if they can straighten it up God will forgive them all right we'll go right away all right number three what do you do if the husband will not bring the other woman to confess like brother Brown suggests now you know what road around say it anybody that needs this we'll be glad to show you that brother Brown said what you do if you're trying to straighten up a marital situation a husband you know he's done the dirty thing he went out committed adultery he's supposed to go get the woman and bring her to his wife and confess it right there same thing for the woman you know she commits adultery she's supposed to go get the man right and bring the man in and sat down and explain it he said well why is that necessary because it cleans up a lot of things and ignition it shows an honesty about the person that's doing it right shows that they want to get it straight you understand all right you see what I wrote around with saying that's the way you do it now if the husband and wife and a man run around or the woman running around whatever side between yourselves that you don't want to go any further then right that wouldn't be nobody else's business that's right amen you know if I run around on my wife and I wouldn't told her about it and she said well I don't care about talking to the woman I said okay but I'll be glad to go get because my point is are we serious enough to straighten up something correctly right come on women or come on men would you be willing to bring the woman or the man to try to straighten it up it was showing honesty in your heart the children you really want to straighten up right right not one day well honey I I run around on you but I know you'd forgive me it's all right you know we don't have to go no further do we now you don't want to straighten it up all right right be willing say honey no it's not our one you know honey run around and said this was the way to do it and if you want me to we'll go do it I'm actually just as honest as I can what are you what's your answer that's right but see then the person on the other side could make the decision of whether or not have to go any further I mean that's your sensual answer but you need to be willing you know you need to be willing that would show the the repentance that would show the the point that you are trying to straighten up you know we don't have to go no further do we huh I'd be like the lady you know said I received the Holy Ghost last night but don't tell nobody well you know what runaround said about that wasn't it he said he doubted she got it right right well if you're not willing to straighten up then you're not trying to be sincere okay so then I hope that answers that now I'll go through these and then come back and let you whatever now is it unconfessed sin our misbehavior if the wife withholds what the husband is doing wrong while coming to church all right so now I get the question is it unconfessed sin or misbehaving if the wife withholds what the husband is doing wrong while coming to church in other words I assume the person is saying that the husband is still coming to church you know it doesn't mean the person being you know the woman in this case God had said about her husband uh you know whoa is it unconfessed sin or misbehavior no not unconfessed sin and it wouldn't be no misbehavior you know for her to withhold that her husband is doing wrong things yet coming to church that wouldn't be it wouldn't be no misbehavior wouldn't be no one confessed sin but eventually it ought to be stopped in the person in order to tell us okay now the wife to the husband husband to the wife okay we don't lay everything on the women on it they should say look are you still going to church acting like that because that's what Paul got into in Corinthians that the man was living with his father's wife in other words your stepmother you know all right I don't know what you'd call it his father's life and he was still in the church evident because Paul said when you come together against which one this guy was evidently coming to church and the way Paul explains it like and brother Brown and verse on it that in other words they were just kind of letting it ride and just kind of maybe even giggling about it and well that's okay I guess you know no it wouldn't all right I'm saying to you man I'm saying to you women your husband is not living right out there and still coming to church you're telling them you're the first one tell them all right now if they don't straighten up then come tell me about it then we'll see whether or not it needs to go before the church right right okay see don't go tell everybody in the community about it everybody in the church about it that's where the biggest problem with people is the biggest problem with people is they got to run their big mouth that's right and they can't just do it sensibly and quietly so they go to and Isaiah are sitting out there waiting on you yeah if I can say it when I come up here people to be prayed for these people sit back did you say they committed adultery when there's walking right now don't tell me that ain't done all right the silliness in people because you don't hear and you put in there your own words or what is saying don't laugh her husband even want her husband doing wrong talk to them first then come talk to me if we feel like going to the church with it we'll go to the church with it then we can explain it to everybody but instead of natural go explain it to everybody and you got everybody in the building on up on your side that's what you're trying to do you know the reason most people are called for crimes they can't stand to be alone so they want to tell somebody what they're done and I want you to say well that ain't too bad we all do things two times today in the funeral two preachers both of them said well none of us could say we're perfect or nothing you know so if you look in the mirror we're gonna find us all guilty well you know it's true but what's your point right right I want to talk about guilt or not guilt right all right is that understandable to keep these in mind if you don't like it then you can we'll get you in just a minute the point that goes with that one was would it be telling on her spouse in other words if she's not if the husband is doing something wrong and still coming to church would it be telling on her spouse you know well I mean I guess it would be but but like I said handle it in the right Channel there's a lot of things could be settled around here that wouldn't get to gossiping ears to running and the phones are ringing and that's what I mean when I say you stay on the phone over five minutes you're gossiping oh that's what I mean and you know what I mean by it it's not that you talk on the phone over five minutes I'm not talking about that I'm talking about gosh so because you know what you're going to do you know what it ain't none of your business what anybody else is doing that's as blunt as I can make it it ain't none of your what I want to pray for her if I don't know what to pray for how can I pray pray God bless them no you want to hear and solve a lot of things to get that gossiping here and here lust an ear off even that's right now you know you can't bring that up against this old boy that's right right you can come on you know this old boy don't tell everything because there's no need of it why but would it be that she's doing would she be telling on her spatiality she'd be telling on her spouses she'd come and told somebody about it yeah but would it be wrong to tell somebody according to who she's doubting I don't think in order to be putting an Anderson Independent do you all right or Atlanta concert tickets you know but do everything in rotten decently in order all right now you ask the question I'm just trying to answer the question you tell me not to tell nobody my wife don't know nobody's gonna know it that's right because I think that's where it ought to be right and I always remind you when you're leaving out I say if this gets out you'll know it didn't come from me okay because I don't run my mouth about it all right would it be telling on her spouse no but you're still a decently mentor you know let everything be done decently in order that's what I try to answer the question as much as I can cherishly in God but yet just plain common sense a lot of times handles a lot of things no it ain't none of our I think I don't like these uh chat rooms and I don't like these things it's on the computers and I will not fooling I know you know the the questions and answers and the things you know talking on it about the message you try Stephen Wilson one time he he went on there one day and looked and he told us years ago so it's all right he looked and somebody asked a simple question he thought man I can answer that he sat down and typed the answer back and back before he'd ever hit the button it was already about five coming his way that was Contra he said I shut it off and got out there but then you get on Facebook and everybody on Facebook's has got pictures of everybody and they got all their trouble yeah you know why because you're not looking somebody in the eye right and it's not as personal as a telephone you know what I mean it's more personal but it's not like a telephone person I'm really in a telephone can answer back once you're typing in there you know they can't answer you back they got to put their thoughts from there I don't like it I don't think it's right just as honest as I could be a man I don't think it's right I think it's a bunch of gosham there's people right here that knows more about what goes on this church than I do and I've told you if you know something in this church that is going on that I need to know if you don't tell me the sin is on you well I know somebody's committing adultery well you better get my office and let me know because if not that makes you guilty of sin what's wrong with that why not why can't we be playing on honest but I don't want to hurt nobody's feel I just don't but you know what the reason people won't come in my office about it because you know what I'll say to you have you got proof yep that's right my brother told me about this brother one time I said do you have any proof okay now no need talking no more on it when you get some proof you come tell me now I didn't mean proof that I meant did he see it all right you know that's hearsay in a court of law is not supposed to be allowed if somebody tells you something you don't tell her that's not allowed in the court of law they shouldn't be allowed in the church over for any time all right but now listen what about it now this other one is kind of a question that would be related to whether or not I go further or whether or not I stay here so anybody got any comments questions off the floor about what we've preached on marriage and divorce you know if they have we'll get the microphone or whatever we can get a hold of or you can have this one I'll go with this one you know does anybody got any comments any questions talk brother Dale why did you say so and so you know I'll do the best I can to answer you because I've always tried to it I don't know everything but I know somebody that knows everything right all we gotta do is get in touch with him and we'll all be able to pray down to live no matter so what about it you need comments on marriage and divorce he'll be different okay we got one I thought I heard you say that um Joseph took Mary San is that did I hear that the Joseph took Mary San Joseph to Mary sin couldn't marry sin yeah did Joseph take Mary sin did I hear you say that oh you're talking about Adam her jokes of sin no no okay I got you now now I may have misunderstood you right now see Joseph covered Mary you didn't partake of her sin okay all right I just missed and that was what I was trying to cover the question come out wrong right see Joseph by taking Mary that's why I said it had to be a married man man that she would have to be engaged to because if marriage just come out and said I'm going to have a baby they killed her it surely would have been God having to come down and do it but because of that of my off they cut it off and use it one use one on the full bed I'll cut this off now is it going out wrong or something yeah okay okay all right so then you know Joseph by receiving Mary he didn't protect a receipt because she didn't have anyone see she and I don't see him she didn't have nothing to to um you know any disloyalty or or any uh problem she was told a virgin and the eyes of the other people she would right exactly okay in the eyes of other people she was an adulteress and they told a story that she was you know uh had an affair with a soldier and that uh you know Joseph covered her and cook of that but now Joseph he just simply he knew the story that she was she was a virgin right and there was no wrong in what she had done all right so there's no sin involved in what she had done and there was no sin involved in him coming you know taking her and receiving her under himself and he didn't even have a relationship with her the whole time that she was pregnant with with Jesus so that was you know a good point but he did receive her and say I will protect her because under the law if a girl was pregnant they had to tell it and they killed him to being crucified killed but Joseph could stand in the plates the married man that's why it had to be a married man he wouldn't it you know it to me it would have been uh even worse to been maybe a young boy would not have understood a lot of them but Joseph was a fairly Old Gentleman that's right and God could talk to him and then talking to him then he told him you know that she's she's pregnant by the Holy Ghost In other words that child in her she wasn't pregnant about it because it was really just God created right there was no we used the word pregnant when you're using it for the basis of and it is pregnant she was but we use it because a manly woman you know right right which is that what you don't want so then he didn't partake of anything he covered her all right now just as Adam the in the beginning Now Eve was wrong right Steve was wrong she had done wrong and he covered her to refuse to allow her to be killed and took her to him said yes because that would have been an easy reason I said was it easy talking about it and then Joseph didn't clicked oh okay we're talking about huh anybody else sister Trudy have you got the thing or take take this okay I really don't know how to ask this question that has a little girl I knew a girl that was in her 20s and her hair came to the middle of her calf I'm wondering God truly would protect somebody is there an age when you and trim a little girl's hair and then as I can't get all other coaches it's not coming up here as good as it probably is and you're talking about a little girl that somebody cuts Your Heart Right somebody tell me because I can't hear it up here you're going to get a little louder it's probably me um would God allow a little girl a Christian family the little girl's hair to be cut to the point where she became a woman that's basically the question I had well if their mom and daddy cut your heart ain't nothing little girl can do so then you'd say would he allow it well um so you get into well that you protect your dish or protect it out he could protect her yeah but in most of the cases it wouldn't be a protection Mom and Daddy would be cutting the babies the girls higher and then when she got up to be a woman you know she could make her own decision all right and see then once she become to that her own decision it wouldn't be that her Daddy Mom was not a decision about cutting her hair is that basically what you're saying it was just that I knew somebody whose hair was so long and she was in her 20s I was wondering whether God would protect it from being a burden when you put that if that's his desire for a woman not to cut her hair I would think that he'd protect it I agree somebody did because either the mom and daddy said well we won't cut your hair you know they honored maybe the girl the girl said she didn't want her good you know and uh no and God would honor that but I'm still saying we're honest that we're the if the little girl was there in the home and Mom and Daddy demanded her hair to be cut they wouldn't be any sin of the little girl irregardless because it would be her mom and daddy or whoever you know the guardian's choice of doing it and then it wouldn't be any sin to the little girl until she'd come to her own age of maturity or whatever you know oh is that getting back because that's the best part and I'm getting to the question all right okay all right who'd win that all right right um I had this question at the Bible study and we didn't get around to our questions but uh uh I guess I should explain something before before I mention this question um uh this is not a quo for my friend question and uh and it's not a question for us either yeah I'll say this you know me and Gabby only held hands with each other I also uh you know we've had we had kids in other relationships but we've never kissed or anything um so this is not for me and it's not for a friend this is just curiosity right uh my question is for what Biblical reason can two people not live together as husband and wife as your engagement but before the wedding ceremony and I think I understood you already asked answered that really you said uh that the wedding is really not complete yet right that's not a complete wedding but they're already married in Gonzaga is married but the wedding's not complete right you know and but if they break though now if a boy and a girl engaged okay and God does the same as marriage all right if either one of them breaks that vow then they're guilty of adultery all right see the boy the girl if they break the vow that the that they made to each other because they become engaged that's the same as Mary all right now if that if they don't fulfill the wedding what is it going to be you understand I think so that could go on through life as being in nothing you know they'd be all right they could both stay virgin and everything would be okay but if either one of them breaks it then they've got the problem is that that the point you're making that yeah would be what and before I'm getting this year saying what would happen if they didn't go on with through the wedding well no no no my question was this uh why could they not all right biblically I won't like if if there's a scriptural reason as to why because to me in God's eyes they're already married I want to say once the man proposes and she accepts they're married in God's eyes so why could they not go and live together as husband and wife in other words well I answered that one oh okay I know that would be fornication right no I mean that's unclean religion um but around said the law gives you a right to live together see it would be unclean living for a boy and a girl to get engaged and go out and start having a sexual relationship right that would be unclean living that would be is just what I'm saying because it would be fornication in other words you both of them got two revved up and wrong directions all right and when they did they wind up and they'd get in the bed together well that don't that don't change nothing now sure they're married yeah they're married that's all right because they're married but when they asked and then by being married when they asked yeah but if they go live together in that time it would be unclean living okay because they haven't fulfilled all of their committals uh the vows at the wedding the uh the the preacher hasn't pronounced them so it would it would be unclean you know now we're talking about American Standard we're not talking about somewhere in Africa or something that they just say hey yeah let's do and they do you know we're not we're talking about the right way and they would do it the right way over there all right I'm coming back to you it's okay hold on she's trying to stay on not understanding I'm understanding what you're saying if the boy and the girl gets engaged why can't they go start living together oh let's see scripture um Paul and saying in the Corinthians that you're you're doing something unseemingly you know I'm trying to think of the scripture somebody can get it you're doing something unseemingly in other words you're you're not waiting until everything is finished um see because you are engaged but you haven't fulfilled rest of your part of being married engagement as far as God is concerned makes you married but it doesn't give you a right to go start living together now that's supposed to be after you go through the church vials you know and then the honeymoon comes that's supposed to be the time to live together and brother random says that the the first kiss or to be it the the doctor now you see then you wouldn't want to go very much further talking if you just said the first kiss or to be a dollar you know you wouldn't want to go into uh having a sexual affair between the boy and the girl even though they are married but it doesn't give them a right to go live together because see you can just write to somebody and say will you marry me and they say yeah Mary you well let's go to bed together and I would be unclean living you know that would be uh wrong in the eyes of God because it would be unclean living they wouldn't be waiting and fulfilling all the others you know and do it you know now even if you moved it to some of these in African situations or some foreign country situation you you go test these people about it and you'd find out that they say step step before you step over the stick and you can't violate that you know it would be that now let me get the law of the land for one reason well the law of the land tells you that because the law of the land that doesn't tell you it's okay to do whatever you're doing the law of the land says that uh you know they just give you the license and run around would use it and say as a right to live together as husband and wife it's the paperwork you sign but see we're going back as I said we're not dealing with the law we're dealing with the scriptural situation that the boy and girl is married and them being married doesn't give them right to go live together they need to go on through the wedding you know you understand what we're going to say married I say married is your engagement so if a boy and girl is engaged they should not have sexual relationship with each other until they come to the altar because it's unclean living best in life the best one right because that was what it would be unclean because they haven't fulfilled the rest of their vows their situations and the people in the church are sitting waiting and saying hey how come these here too you know they've been engaged for two years and got three kids well they're engaged the same as bad now that don't come up to me with that now I'll say you know I don't agree with it right right now that could be what had happened out of it if you just went ahead and started living together right you'd wind up with being kids born before you fulfill the rest of your vows and we don't agree with that part because it would be uncleanly it would be fornication that's the fornication we're talking about you say well why the why is the fact that you're not supposed to do it there's no other reason than why the law only gives you a right to go down and live together as husband and wife and right off you tax the bracket it ain't got nothing to do with us being married yeah but if you if it wound up she could wind up with a baby born before they ever had their problems with the older that would be fornication that'd be unclean living right and that's why Paul says this is unseemingly to his virgin his virgin because his girl and boy both have urgency man had Divergence as well and that that would be you know there wouldn't be anything to just go out and live together I mean maybe I'm old-fashioned but that's the way I look at it that you're not supposed to do that and I think that you ought to straighten that up between yourself now if somebody done that then you go straight up to yourself and say I'm sorry we should have waited all right let's see then that would be the point of sale well we did do wrong because you understand what I'm saying I'm trying to answer the question but answer it in a sensible form that you can wind up with a baby out of just being engaged and I'm sure it wouldn't look good so that would be against Christianity as far as saying a quote out of the scripture you can't come up with whatever I think I may have found a scripture that might help all right First Corinthians 6 First Corinthians 6 verse 12. all things are life belong to me but all things are not expedient right all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any right exactly so because you let's see let me look through here because I got it um oh lonely Grace I got something written down that's flicking in my mind 7 36. right yeah but if a man thanked him that he had behaved himself on commonly toward his virgin if she passed the fire of her age and need no requirement this has got to go back something else I'll explain this uh everyone said don't live I'm looking it's written on pages of my Bible said don't live dirty that's the way he said yeah because he's saying here see if she passed the floor of her age you need so require let him do what he will he sineth not let him marry that's not that's that's talking of of the man's virginity and and literally in plain language it's saying that if it passed the point of him being able to have a relationship then they could still get married and not understand it I mean that's what that's going on into I'm sorry it's just you know pass the flower but what I said the man's got a virginity as well as the woman's got a virginity right and we just hop on to the woman you know and don't say nothing about the man well we better get down on both of them I'm still trying to find that we'll run around and said don't live dirty I'll find it and bring it back okay where he just says don't live dirty oh that would be dirty to go on and go ahead and live together before you go on down to the thing because that would you would be sure you say well we're married well you can't convince the judge that and you certainly wouldn't want to try to convince the denominations about that it's a woman and man gets engaged they can just go ahead and live together you try that out there with the denominations they tell you wrong right we deal in a lot of other rents was that clear what you're talking about brother Al so further thought on that to me you've got to come to the ceremony to be joined together as one in God and nothing should happen until that is second place because you're finishing the way right you got stairs you're engaged you've got no vials and then you got the honeymoon as last name of justification and sanctification but not yet got the Holy Ghost so that would be the point somebody else okay I'm gonna write any comments any thoughts it seems complex gonna do if that'll work no we're not going to get into the sermon I'll do it Sunday so uh Joe and them don't even have to type up their notes because I had him to lay these aside and I've got them holding here it's worth it there's something that I want to speak to you about and I ask you I don't know how many times I've asked you to please read invisible you now please before Sunday right read invisible beginning man I mean today I just had just a little town I just went and sat down just looking through it I keep it in my possession laying on my desk read an invisible Union it might be surprises spread around himself you might find out why he say it a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of the Seven Seals that's on marriage and divorce right read invisible Union I ask you to to a word that you can be with me when I start going through it to express something about this on marriage and divorce that I've seen for I don't really know how many years back that the Lord spoke to me about it or started talking to but now it's coming out to work and explained amen you know in wordings that can be expressed because I always wondered why this ties with this foreign so then brother brother boy so this you have the free line oh what if you go through counseling and the pastor uh he just comes flat out and tells you you divorce not for any uh anything that's done outside them the relationship but you were trying to save a marriage and you went counseling and counseling and counseling and he just finally comes up says you need to get out of there if the pastor just tells you that you need to get a divorce and it's not on scriptural grounds would it be scriptural ground in other words would it be an adulterous Affair or a fornication involved this is my situation this is what happened years ago yeah okay and I tried to save and save and he said you need the divorce there you are now ignorance of the word of on my part is the problem right I understand I understand but I often think you're counseling somebody how can you ever save it the thing about it is what's he going to have on his shoulders a judgment that's it see misinterpreted theology is what around said the reason we're in this marital situation you go to church where somebody okay is for these things they just marry and remarry and divorce and you know and that you go to the Catholic and there's no worse there but they just sprinkle salt on you turn you around and they actually speak your virginity back that's actually the doings with the brother in this message he spoke to virginity he said back into his sister you know what I I immediately knew that something wrong sort of run and grabbed the message started searching I found it but around said that's Catholic Church that does that see it's not not the doings but it's you know got a delivery thank you now let's see what it oh okay so he found all right this is on the mesh on questions and answers in 64. the morning service paragraph 304 is basically what it is talking about what this pertains is but if you cannot contain let them marry for it's better to marry than to burn all right that's for just dirty living watch it instead of a boy a man a boy and girl or something another when they're going together and and they know that they should be married go ahead and get married thank you you understand what I mean don't you see don't just live with dirty little life there because it's not right you see that's your sister in one sense where if you're a Christian now if it's the world it's the world dog eat dog but this girl that you're going with that's your sister too that will be the mother of your your children that will come don't live a dirty life little life around her show that you're a real Christian gentleman live like a Christian gentleman ought to and treat her like your sister when you get married still treat her that way foreign the Bible said not let one dirty conversation come among you when your professional colonist treat that little lady like she's your little sweetheart if she's 60 years old you'll be just the same you be that Gallant boyfriend remember you are you don't try none of these new things and I know what I'm talking and you just be a husband a genuine brother a genuine Christian I know that sounds but you're my kids I got a right to say what I want to you you see you're my kids you liberal and you women live the right way to your husband and your husband your husband live the right right to to your wives be real nice real nice just respect one respect one another just with and your your family relationships and so forth like that let it be just irreverently and godly and agree with among you and everything as it could be don't never push and shove and be dirty invoker I knew that was Richmond was the part that I was doing come running around and said don't live dirty so that would be fornication would be unclean leaving just because you get engaged and then you say well we can just go ahead and live together that's unclean living right that would that shouldn't be done that would be you know going your brother Brown said go get married so it's better to marry it is to burn now that don't justify somebody else that says it's better to marry than to burn that don't give a guy right it's married two or three times to say well it's better for me to go get married it is to burn you ought to do some praying about burning that's just plain but they ought to be praying for that you you say well that's too hard to pray about that brother well I'm a brother Ashley one time a question answered as honest I could he said Can a homosexual be saved I'm sure but he won't remain homosexual that's right you won't do that again can a prostitute be saved yes but they won't go living in their prostitution you want scripture for that one now for sure and Jesus still said go and sin no more unless the worser thing he said come upon you all right to anybody else thank you brother thank you anybody else any comments questions thoughts your childhood you're scratching your head or you want that stuff we do this like you're saying it to sale just don't never raise your hand at a sale you might buy some so just keep both hands down but just joking anybody got any comments any college I just asked you to please Rick you got something yeah you thought that uh but if I got married the one now um being married by the justices of peace is not right as Christians it shouldn't be done but if the law is legal and if you're not Christian and marrying and the gesture of the peace does it then it is all right because it's a legality of the state law that the Justice these have the right to do your wedding the judge has the things but uh brother Brown and explaining it said you ought to get married in a church that was way explained so if you ought to get married in a church all right but he said now they're regardless you are married the the judge of the peace done the wedding you're married okay all right anybody else we need to realize that uh all the things was done in the past of course it's in the past and the way we look at things now what we're doing is we're trying to clean up a mess right try to clean up a mask from all of us made and because of misinterpreted theology Even in our own mind you didn't have to be a church member but your own misinterpretation that's why this that's why this marriage and divorce situation is so serious because it is here to clean up somebody that wants to be a real true Christian and it's here it's here to clean us up and this is the guideline that we we go by now we've made errors in the past maybe but like brother Burns it he said he said go on as you are but you know God help you if you do it again right well that's what we got to do we gotta we got to take here and realize that once we become Christians we don't even participate in the things of the world we should never even have the mindset of what the normal world is because the normal world you can divorce in 15 you know 15 minutes or 15 hours whatever it is the minimum time you and they don't care anymore it's like we were talking today people just don't care anymore they married and divorced yeah do this live together have kids it doesn't bother them to have kids you know and uh this is for Christians only right right this is for and I'm talking about born-again Christian this is for born-again Christians only but how to get our life straightened out that's why marriage and divorce should never be discussed with anybody that's not a born-again Christian right because it will do them no good until they see the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ first for their own soul clean the soul up first the the word's been here for two thousand years to clean the soul up but in the end time God's trying to get a people to realize that we can get clean not only on the inside but on the outside right now that's that's been almost an impossibility like like Paul said he sees through a glass Darkly well well he saw something he was trying to attain to but he couldn't get there because he didn't have enough word opened up to allow him to get to that exactly it wasn't that the word was not there the word's been there since the foundation of the world but man's theology has closed everybody's mind made everybody misinterpret what God said it wasn't so from the beginning but what we got to realize is that that it's good to have this it's good to have questions but realize one thing this is for you and I only right this is for us if you're born again and you go on As You Are God forbid if you do it again now God's made a way for you to clean yourself up and there's no way you can do it but you've allowed God to take over and not just say well well God now I'm cleaning the soul but not now God you can clean me up in the body right because that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with with with clean living if we're not living clean right now then then you're not born again you just just start at that point and say God I'm not I'm not where I should be if if I'm you know God forbid if somebody's sitting in this building is committing adultery uh you know somebody come in two days ago maybe but we've been sitting here more than two weeks we ought to realize what's been preached from the pulpit right ought to convict you if you're if you're truly a Christian and and I know a lot of us all sitting here we needed the grace of marriage and divorce and the Grace has been given and we've taken that Grace but let's don't make it this great right let's let's let's take it as something that that God has given us and give no one else on the face of the Earth is that right he's not giving this to anybody since the dawn of time Even Adam and Eve messed it up but he's given us an opportunity right here in the end time to clean this thing up right yeah sure we all got a problem but God's gave us a way to get out of it all right to take care of us if not We're not gonna have a body chain right it's not body change won't come if we keep all this in the misintercept theology is still working today you want to just misinterpret the Theology of marriage and divorce I don't know it's misinterpret Theology of everything all the documents in the message and all the mess ups uh you know like I said like you said a false Doctrine is not going to take a body change no no can't do it why because it has not seen the grace that's right that God's give us through the brother Brown was ministering through the preaching of the final four Ministries for the you didn't say for the perfecting of the Saints soul so he's going to perfect this body spirit and soul somewhere somewhere down the line we're going to see that God's done this for us right and then that's when we can really uh you know you don't get the big head you really think so so less of yourself you're so humbled that that uh the guy show this to me and then we we embraced the grace and then we extend the grace but we need to realize that what's past is past what's done is done right and let's move on like Paul said to the mark of the high call right our higher calling was is higher than Paul's right our higher our higher calling is sitting in this seed in a Pew in a message Church believing what the preachers are saying and doing what the what the uh what the word of God says well the marriage and divorce like you said marriage and divorce not something brother Brown pulled out of the sky and that's all through the Bible exactly all through the Bible it's laying right there for us to to see and then when Jesus was confronted he exactly took him right back and said hey it wasn't so from the beginning but because of the hardness of your heart unless he's talking to us he wasn't talking to the Pharisees that day he's talking about Pharisees that within us exactly because the hardness of your heart Moses Paul brother Brown gave us exactly her brother Brown was writing a divorcement is going to take us to a body chain the writing of divorcement they give Moses and Paul was a written piece of paper you understand what I'm saying it was a written piece of paper and you handed it to your wife well that's sure that's natural we talk about it in the end time but spiritually it's got to be dated right and the Man Came beavers I mean the woman can't be divorced horse gotta be dated that's what we got to work on on the spiritual part right right I just want everybody to realize that this is a great thing it's a great this is not preached many places you know why because the preachers scared the preacher because the people leave the lead I throw him out yeah one of the two because it still is misinterpreted theology in the message but thank God we've we've had truth preached and the word of God preached here and other places that we hear it from I just think God that he's let me just hear it you're serious exactly I agree with you I believe it I don't want to read this question on Sunday how do you know that you know I'm ready how do you know that you know that your denominational husband is dead how do you know that you know that's what you call being certain right you know that's double statements means you're wanting to be certain how do you know that you know your denominational Hood hmm Lord willing we'll try to get on that if you're in the invisible Union you'll be very helpful in under me come on brothers because I just I left it said Lord I want to preach what I got on my heart but if there's enough questions and answers I don't want to get into it because it would take us about probably the best I could do and face that I could read at least an hour o'clock we change the situation we'll take it up Sunday and just you know that way we can get in on the topic but how do you know that you know it's your old husband is dead what we got brother 48 and the black notebook 48 in the black notebook a bless your name anybody have a knee let's Stand Together thank you unless you unless you're sure even here foreign their
