Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes shining in the light of your glory to power and love as we asleep holy holy holy holy spirit amenity amen you want to see him look into the word let's just have a moment of prayer because the devil's trying to hinder sister Trudy croissant back there and she's having a lot of problems so let's pray I've already

in every way to keep us from bringing what you would want us to bring to the people now he's acting up Among Us and we just challenge him now upon the basis of your word because it's not us anyway it's not what we can do it's not Iris it's all in your hands so we condemn that devil that's trying to hinder our sister and we Proclaim it to be all as well because we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen amen I think she'll be all right I called Anna and she said she was still having a lot of trouble so remember her and just keep praying for her we want to thank everybody for praying for a wife about the the skin cancer that was on her face and they went back went in our Thursday and cut it all off and said they got everything there was no problem you know no trouble whatsoever but we thank you for for praying for her and taking and two remind us at the end of the service to pray over some prayer claws because we had them they were so small until we were losing some of them so I cut up another one to remind us the end of it to pray over these prayer Clause okay remember now there won't be any Services coming Wednesday that will be Christmas so we say to each one of you Merry Christmas and just have a good time in Christ all right the watch Night Service December the 31st Tuesday evening starting at eight o'clock the brother Timothy Burdette will be preaching for us and just come and be with us and bring your finger foods and things if you want it come on in earlier we'll be here six o'clock or a little better and just come and we'll have a time of Fellowship together before the service and all and then remember that then there will be no service on January the first because that would be the the next day following their service that night so remember that January the first no service remember Bible study will be on the fourth day of January at six o'clock so remember these and just pray that the Lord would bless remember Wade and June we'll be traveling going out to Oklahoma into that away Kansas and just remember to pray for them the Lord would bless remember all that will be missing some will be during that period of time so pray that the Lord would would be with each and every one of us if you like turning your scriptures return to Romans 8 where we've been reading from and then we will turn to Second Corinthians five it's going to be the Romans 8 Second Corinthians 5 we'll try to get into our thought that we bundled up so much and messed up so much this morning maybe we can preach it and make a better job I have it this evening but we pray that the Lord would bless each one now father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us thank you for all things you said you give them to us freely so we believe it We Believe Lord that you're with us that you'll bless and guide each and every one of us take care of everything Lord that your love would be made manifest here Among Us that we may see you and want to walk our hand forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us and just bless remember the sick among us there are Satan trying to hinder sister Trudy and we pray that you had touched and let everything be all right and the testimony be given we love you and we thank you guide us now forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you Lord and just have your way in Jesus name amen Romans 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren or for whom he did predestinate then he also called in whom he called and he also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified what then what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us okay second Corinthians we'll try to get to this point this afternoon for chapter five verse 1 through 4 for we know that if our Earthly houses this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this heresy we've grown earnestly designed to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word and I pray that you would look over my harshness and sternness and aggravation and whatever you want to call me and just look to one thing and believe that I'm just trying my best to get you and I to see Jesus Christ and where he's at and what we are because uh you know and I believe that God is real I do I believe there's a real God I believe he's more real than we are I believe he's more tangible every how you say that word you know real sound firm whatever and if we get that far today if we don't we'll take it up later we'll go into next year talking about this if nothing else that you say well did did God have a body said he did right he said he was in that body when he appeared to Moses when he appeared to Abraham he was in that body but see we look at things and we just don't want to make them to be on a real thing we want to kind of well God is a spirit but just remember God is trying to explain to us in human terminologies what he is in eternity now how can that be done the best we can do we mess it all up you know that's why I said this morning talking about brother random and the way he talked because see a theologian could never drop long enough to to be able to express enough to us for us to be able to see God as real and really they could never express enough to see you and I are real but you know what the thing that I want you to see more than anything else is the soul of that individual if it was just one person God gave his life that life was released out of that body to save just one person so how much or how real are we the spirit will were not just a spirit you know we're more real than anything could be yeah but Iran says you have within you the ability to create a world and go live on it but he said it's held by a bar you know not a buyer yeah Jesus was born out of Resurrection until the time was finished and then he could raise see where you and I are here because of what we are and what we're doing but when the bride relied on who she is and what she's here for amen she'll be gone let's see that's what I'm trying to get you to see that you and I are real we're not just uh some float around even if we die we have a place to go to whether we are our Christian or not we have a place to go to in every soul belongs to God Satan can't give you a soul he can't create there's no way he can do it well he he created me in nature no he didn't create you in nature he just guided you in the wrong direction if you're going to do anything you better realize the fact that you created your own nature you know you made your own nature you know the way that I preach you we God never put us in a pawn shop we put ourselves in the pawn shop he's trying to get us out all right but to just think about it the soul is what God is working on and that soul of that individual is more real than the body and spirit because the body and spirit can be destroyed you know are removed or whatever you want to call it but the soul of man only God can destroy that so which ones are real well I just brother Dale I just never seen my real self what do you mean what do you mean you've never seen your real self you mean you don't know your desires come on you don't know your own desires well I desire this I'm not talking about the junk garbage it went because we're human beings I'm not talking about fleshly things that are motivated or whatever I'm talking about a real desire don't you have a desire within you to serve God why would a heathen give their babies to an alligator or whatever if they didn't believe in God but see we don't think he's real we just think he's some form of a spirit part but just remember he created us and if he created us he's more real than we are and that's right but brother Dale I just thought God was a spirit and see here's what we think too we think God is a spirit and then he comes downward to try to make a body to come and live in well where did he come from and what was he just remember he's more real than we are I hope you follow that line but just remember now we were studying it talking this morning Ezekiel 18 4 says All Souls are mine Satan can't create a soul he can't create anything he perverts what God creates amen and he can't do anything in the world with us until God gets through with us no matter what he thinks he can try and he can't do it right all right before the world ever began in God's mind God knew how many Souls he would create and where they would take up or come into a body form to live in upon Earth would you go that way amen amen that before the world ever be gone if not then you're trying to make him like you and I were peanut brains that are trying to make a decision as we go along that way see he can say Jacob how I loved he saw how I hated before either one ever come into the world because of his foreknowledge all right see then think about it there's not going to be any extra bodies right they're not going to be any extra Souls it didn't come into being and that's where I'm so glad that the prophet explained it and whether we want to believe it or not but he said a baby's not a soul until it's birthed it's like a wiggling animal with animal Wiggles in the mama same as a human Wiggles into mama the animal body could have feelings in that form you know as well as a human being all right but it's not a living Soul until God breathes the breath of life into it and it becomes a living soul see that to me is greater than all other scientific knowledge that mankind could ever do him because you're thinking about just a cubicle and a little spot that God puts something here to put something here to put something here and then he just takes them out and you know no it's all in his foreknowledge and all of what he's doing but we'll get back to that all right we found that God could only is the only one that could create a soul just as well as he's the only one that can destroy our soul if God created All Souls then they would have to be created perfect because he cannot create anything imperfect I didn't say eternal I said perfect even according to Ezekiel 28 12 and 13 through there Satan was created perfect in Beauty even he was the anointed cherub that Stood Beside the Lord he was perfect in his creation he went wrong and become the devil he wasn't created the devil he become that all right see then that way that no matter what every human being they would ever come into the world would come into Satan's domain and have the nature of that domain and be perverted all except the Lord Jesus Christ which was God Almighty in his entrance into the human race all right now and no matter what a soul of man is created in the image of God even in the center yeah because why because he's he's got creative ability you know he can do things that animals can't do that all right the prophet would even call it on the message called questions and answers let's go ahead and start our number four brother we might as well do it if I have to slow down I'll slow down God I know and realize Satan is fighting this to try to keep it from being done he's fighting me and he's fighting everything but I'll get across what I believe and then we can deal with that go ahead number four which is questions and answers 19 54 515 paragraph 280. look what he says go ahead and roll it on up you can read all up and down about the Genesis 2 man in different things he's an animal dumb brute he's talking about animals right now he's not talking about man okay he's an animal dumb brute he hasn't got a soul he can't read and write he can't talk speak he's a dumb brute now here's where we're going brother don't know it they taught dogs to say words that's what I'm saying this morning you go down and you tell somebody Sue they gave me a perfect bill of health there's plenty of people died with a perfect million what are you trying to do why don't you admit you're an unbeliever I'm sorry forgive me I get started again because it tires me up look he can't read or write he can't talk speak he's a dumb brute but a man is in flesh like a brute but he's got a soul of God in him what makes him Immortal he even wants to call it now we know that doesn't mean Eternal but it means we have the ability to be made Eternal why because see what he's talking about and he can invent look what he can do he's on almost on the equal with God because he's the son of God even in his Fallen estate he's wonderful look at him the human being has a right to come to immortality if we believe but he's a soul and we'll read like he put it on like here's saying something he put it on now according to Blasphemous names turn around and said Adam was standing there coming up out of the earth that he was in and said God breathe into his nostrils and he become a living soul he said well what was it before then he was 16 elements right he need to became a living Soul all right we're going to see today what that really was getting to but look think about these things now even in his Fallen condition look at the next one and inside 1962. and now now being that he has made even in his Fallen condition yet he's in the image of his maker God and in one sense of the word he's the son of God fallen from Grace because that's what he is had there been no sin what would we have done right he's falling away from what God made him to be and he's following the state gives him them attributes to try to do something to bring himself back up to a place where something inside of him tells him that he come from now think about it because he knows he's not in the right condition yet because he sees death sickness and Sovereign heart aches and disappointments he knows he wasn't made for that yet no matter how far he is away from God there is something with inside of him that tells him that some inside something now a man is made up as a Triune being so body and spirit Even in our fallen estate we have creative abilities like Wade was talking about Wednesday TV was in the garden what was it not sitting there so oh give me the name of one you know some name or something yeah all right wasn't an automobile sitting out there no all of the material that it would take to make those things was in the garden all right and in doing that all I had to do would just be brought together who brought it together who brought together all of this material and made it into houses and cars and planes and man right right because he was in the image in his Fallen estate he's in the image of his creator because he has creative ability the Bible says the imagination of man's heart was continually evil but he had to put him out of the garden why look what it would be if you had an eternal soul and you out of the garden stinking like a natural carnal person it'd be trouble but you see folks now get the point let me get down to what I'm talking about whether you believe what I'm talking about or not just listening that's where I believe that the soul of an individual you go to the fatherless countries that have never heard the name Jesus that was amazing when they went back into the jungles of Africa or some continent like I believe it was Africa and they found a mother-son worship right where did that come from when they never heard of a white man or seen one you know where a black person who was saved you know what I mean they feed their kids to the alligators to try to piece them they worship somebody was telling me just the other day that the problem they were having now with the the Indian people well where was that somebody told me said the problem they were having with the Indian people now was that the Indian people were trying to lean back away from Christianity back to their old way of life because you know they've seen Christianity's fail and they're trying to lean back to their old form of life you know that like it was Geronimo when it saw visions they lived of the nature of the land and they felt a call of everything and they were in a lot of ways a whole lot better than we were right because they were just plain Indians run around and said that they believe in an imaginary way that their imaginary God has entered that Idol and he said and they can even hear voices speaking to him well could be very close might be better off to be that than it is some Christianity today right but yet we don't want it to be that way but you see the soul of an individual no matter what he is whether he's lost whether he's saved what he is it's a marvelous thing to think of being a person he said well I'm a person I'm Body Spirit and soul that's fine it takes that to make you just like father-son holy ghost makes one true and living God but just remember the soul is what God is working on we read that this excuse me this morning and he's working on that soul trying to contact us to save us he's not interested in Saving bodies that'll take place in the process because that's in the process of salvation all right he's interested in our soul read through the scripture now and just everything you read look at the word soul even though you may read the word heart as we were using this morning you know out of the heart precedes all things envious drivers you know Murder whatever comes out of the heart what out of the soul of man not out of the thumping gizzard that we call a heart the heart of man is the sinner or the the real part of your being that's real and that's where the soul is and you say well brother Dale you mean you believe souls are real I believe your soul is so real if you remove from right here you're going somewhere and you're not going to change looks I've got a quote in here somewhere where brought around and said it doesn't change your soul doesn't change because then it just changes the place you're either here you're there it doesn't change it would you know now I don't believe those are beyond the curtain of time the bride of Christ or they're in Old bodies but I ain't going to argue with you about them others in other dimensions I'm just not going to argue with you about it I'm going to leave it alone because I don't know I ain't never found where brought around said they wasn't looking old or young or whatever all right so we just leave that alone let it go nah the real you the part of you that we'll read in a minute that is your intelligence your intelligence is not your body that's that brain it's just a masses of you know computerized sales or whatever you don't call it um it's not just the spirit of man your intelligence is the real you because that's what's doing the thinking me all right and being the real you that intelligence that's a person and God is not working to save a spirit just some spiritual being he wants to say that from what come on from what are you going to save it from you knock a person in the head and they become paralyzed immobile from neck down or safe but you know what that don't stop their thinking right and you stop the mobility of the person right I believe God God's real I don't believe he was just a Cloud floating around and then he decided to come something else and then he decided to become something else and he finally created a body and said well that's good I'll just live right there he would already live in before then but around and said that's a difference in him and you or not he said he came in that word body form read who is this male chatted in case I don't get back to it tonight I mean this afternoon see we we had to bypass and come down but now when I get into what I'm going to say here then you're going to say how did we do this how did we do that just don't worry about how did we do we're not playing Howdy Doody that's a long time ago even the kids now don't even know about how to duty right any of the kids know about it now no they don't even know about it they know all this other stuff but us old kids known about howdy Duty you know you know but listen if you can believe that the soul of the individual is more real than this pulpit and if it's not more real I want to ask you a question do you believe the prophet said you have within you the ability to create a world do you believe that well then it's got to have it's got to be more real than this it would be able to bring it into being but see the soul of an individual is the real you now listen to what I'm saying when I start on this part next you're going to run haywire and people will run that away and run that away just stay with me I'm talking about the soul of an individual as to being the real you I am not talking about salvation at this moment of the message I'm talking about just us as human beings this human beings keep that in mind as we we read some that's why I can believe and I don't have to you know if I've ever done it come and show me where I've had to reject a quote the prophet was saying come on you got the internet you got the messages you got the ability to search me back to 19 and or to 2002 at least even on the internet come on and see if I've changed because I've always believed what I'm trying to talk about that God is real and there's the soul of man is real man it's just floating around or some spirit that motivates you you know now see that way we can tell whether we're Hypocrites or not gotta remember that the prophet said they were Hypocrites because out of their mouth they said one thing but their actions was another thing say you are the Messiah in the forms of saying it but then they would back out and say we know nobody can do what you're doing but then they turn around say and kill him for being what he was all right now see I believe what the prophet had to say in another way I can keep it lined up right so let's go now and go to where everybody knows where I'm fixing to head that's been around here for a while but let's go to number six which is 279 of the Hebrews chapter 2 part 3 57 823 to 8 28 school which is actually uh page 80 of the Hebrew Book even to those that don't have the ability to search go to page 80 in the Hebrew Book then you'll find this quote and when Man became into that body he had control of the fishes and the fowls and the beasts of the field now what body was that in the image of God created he him and gave you know male or female created them and gave them ruling ability over the animals so what did he create this is Spirit was God just a spirit they were there in theophany form right the soul to look at him and then there was no man to till the soil Genesis 2. he doesn't make male and female but there's no man to tell the soil he hadn't brought him into being first man was spirit being God's spirit being right right what form was God in what form was the man in all right so roll it on up you can read in between he's made out of the Dust of the earth he's made all the things and here's the one that where people go Haywire then but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany now this is not as I said something new for me to preach This is 40 years old or more when those two Soul people was trying to tell you how many Souls you had God was revealing to me that he was real and he was trying to get us to see how real we are but brother Dale I've always believed that my theophany was up there and I got a lot of quotes from The Prophet no I know what brother Rhino says he said it was up there and we're down here but I remind you he also said we always was eternal but he also said we had to receive eternal life to become eternal no see what I'm saying you can just throw quotes anywhere you want to let the prophet of God says your soul is your theophany do you believe that Jesus is so was his theophany let's establish that his soul was his theophany because that's the way he came before he came on down into human flesh all right so let's go ahead and read a little bit look at number seven this is called entombment 57 426 or 420 excuse me here he goes where did he leave when he left the Bible said he ascended and went and preached the souls that were in prison that repented not into long-suffering on the days of Noah remember the Bible says so spirit s but the word spirit and soul is interchangeable see the scripture says the spirit that brought around when he brings and he brings the law and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the long days in the days of Noah his soul his Spirit his theophany of his own being that pretty well covers it all done went down he said let's follow him he goes down and describes going on down the place of going downward and he describes a place of going upwards see soul to the unjust down there he went and preached to the souls in prison all right now look at this one this is a message called Faith 1961 813 which is uh paragraph four I think it goes through paragraph seven then when we receive Christ into our horse there's all that we have need of there's eternal life now Christ could not come back until three days was fulfilled because his Spirit was behind the screen like a bar like this that he could not cross over that bar because it was a spoken word that he was to lay in the grave for three days and three nights that's what kept Him from Raising right okay now he could not come back until that three days and nights was up then went three days and nights were up his Spirit was loose it went directly to his soul and his soul came back and he picked up the body and fulfilled what he said I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up again I have the power now we just read the quote before that his soul went to hell all right now he said describing it look at that now this is the quote that we're talking about now each one of you have power the same way what did he have to do he had power to lay his life down he had power to take his life back and watch now each one of you have power the same way because you are Sons and Daughters of God and the Very Spirit that's in you this morning the Holy Spirit has seen you this morning that same holy spirit will raise you up so you have power to raise yourself back up don't worry if you die don't worry about it when you die your soul will go the under the altar of God what not in right in the presence of God now you're because we'll divide that in a minute because the sold under the altar is not right directly into his friend you remember brother random when he went beyond the curtain of time he wanted to see Jesus he said he's in a higher dimension okay so hold on to that now your spirit will go to God but you cannot come back you remember the Bible that said the spirit the souls under the alt are crying how long how long they could not return until the scriptures fulfilled and right Christ could not return until the scriptures fulfilled then after the all has been done all the suffering's over and the Brethren has suffered the same things where we've suffered like they suffered and so forth then on that day you'll know exactly where you're buried your spirit will be turned loose from God and will come to that soul now the soul is that part of you who knows and understands your intelligence now watch him this now is 1961. you remember the vision I had not long ago or the little translation and I went into that place and saw those people now your spirit will come back to that body and that that kind of a body the soul and he's calling it a body which is the body that does not have to eat and so forth if this early type of natural meters are we have one already waiting a Celestial body and with that spirit and that soul and Celestial body you rise up again this Natural Body to that great Millennium seal you have the power in you now to do that now but that power that you have in you now could make a new world God doesn't have a little weak spots and big heavy spots that's powerful the least little touch of God is on the omnipotent see the least little touch of God all right you can actually create a world watch out but you have a reason for not doing why because what do we need one right right it wouldn't work but your soul now watch if his soul was his theophany now remember we'll get to it in a minute that's the offense body it's not just a spirit that floats around it's a body God lived in a body and it's called in forms of theophany look at the next one number eight notice these Souls unto the order this is taken from demonology in 1953 11 12. notice these sold under the altar here they sold I mean in Jesus here I read the text a few minutes ago and he goes more of My Flesh on you know the Hope neither would I suffer my Holy One to see corruption not leave my soul in hell now there's a scripture party it ain't going to leave your soul in hell and said nothing about his body or his spirit and he's going to leave us all in Hell a better scripture for that is found in Peter he said Jesus when he died he went and preached to the souls that were in Chains of darkness in prison waiting for the Eternal judgment that Jesus when he died at Calvary went and preached to souls unjust Souls that repented not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah now his soul is his theophany you see the point is we think but but brother I thought we had a theophany up there now here's one of them things you're going to have to think you remember the other day Revelation 7 where brother Branham says that is not the bride and two messages after then which that was in the seals two messages I showed up and he said it was the bride oh brother Dale that's contradictory no they're both right it's according to what you're applying it amen amen now to say your spirit went to hell you'd be right because it's his soul to say your soul went to hell they arrived in his soul is his theophany because that was the body he come in back before the foundation of the world and then he could create from that body which will be the word form I hope we get time to get to it but see we think that we've got something up yonder and we're down here that's right that's exactly right well I don't see how you can we down here and be up there why don't you ask God to reveal it to you why don't you take a look at the Statue of a perfect man you're born again at Faith right that's the new birth well you know the day you got the new birth did you have the headstone no you got to grow into it but it was already there you're going to say it wouldn't but that's God's mind now I'll come back through this again a dozen times I know you check where brother random is talking about that we already have that body that's exactly right I believe it because that's the positive of God's mind there's something pulling you right the positive of God's mind is pulling you an eye toward that being just like the statue of a perfect man when you get Faith it starts a pull up to the headstone all right see then it's right to say we have one waiting but it's right to say my soul is my theophany and I told you I wasn't talking about all about Christians but we're going to read a quote in a minute where that those Souls that he wouldn't preached to in hell they were in theophany also he said you've confused me no I didn't I have not confused you you were already confused and I exposed it so don't say brother Dale you're so D I can't understand if you'll pray ask God to speak to you amen and then listen with common sense you know just common sense because we're going to read in a minute because it said it under scripture in Corinthians we have one in heaven eternal do we have eternal life up there and we have eternal life down here come on you see folks we missed the whole thing it's just like the quotes from Brother random Soldier under the old are crying how long oh he straightened that out on the fifth seal he said Souls under the altar was the fifth sealed you he never said so done a daughter as if you have sealed Jew he said sold under the altar that cry how long how long to avenge our blood is the fifth sealed Jew he said because the bride don't ask for Revenge he said that's the way you can tell the difference then in 1965 the angel of the Lord referred to souls under the altar as being the soldier of those individuals he went and saw beyond the curtain of time you see I know when I start talking like that it requires a revelation to understand that but all I do is just ask you to go pray I don't ask you my wife my kids my grandkids great grandkids I don't ask them to believe what I believe I ask them to have their own Holy Ghost speak to them because me speaking to them is wonderful that's fine but it won't get my revelation but when God speaks it'll be revealed to you then nobody can't take it away from you that's right you mean you come all this way and you believe in one God and you no we don't understand everything about it do it no huh but we believe it and somebody come along said ain't one God in the Bible it's a trinity well I didn't realize that it's a trinity then you'd ever seen it you didn't even see it intellectually listen sold under the altar let's read it right now while we had it in okay number nine it's taken for trying to do God a service without his will without it being God's will 1965 11 27 so this is way after the opening of the seals okay paragraph 228 if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have on one already waiting well brother Dallas already over there well he describes it the good Heavenly Father permitted me to walk behind that curtain one day and see it how many heard that see look at the past the curtain of time there it was just the same as I'm preaching to you all are they stood Souls under the altar crying how long not just a myth somebody who had intelligence you know not just a myth it's somebody that had intelligence how long Lord see while we feel that ever now is our age huh listen go on to the next one we'll just stay after this we'll stay on things that are to be which in 1965 1205. paragraph 127 128. and he's coming down and said past and the boy stops it don't you remember her I said no now where's the at beyond the curtain of time right did you letter to Christ when she was 590. in case you see why she says precious brother I said well do do you go said no we're waiting here I said well if I passed over I want to see Jesus said you can't see him now watch somebody's telling him it right they said to him you can't see him now this is the scripture said sold under the altar he's just a little higher someday he will return we'll go back to Earth we don't eat or drink here Souls under the altar that takes it away from just being a filth sealed Jew Phil sealed you remember said how long how long to avenge our blood read your scripture the bride is beyond the curtain of time today and what did he see Souls real people he said back prior to this just like speaking to you he could feel them he could handle them he could hear them right now come on so they were real not just Spirits floating around okay look at the next one we brought back questions and answers on Hebrews 2 16 57 1002. his body was in the grave and his soul was in Hell preaching alive what about that he was in his theophany again his soul was down there with those people that were in theophany also now he's down there okay and was witnessing to them that they repented not in the long suffering see Church we're not opening up and asking God for a revelation we're trying to pull a revelation down into our category and that won't work message adoption paragraph 97 1965 18. and Paul said it does not yet appear just exactly what kind of a body we'll have but we know we'll have a body like his okay what did you ever what did he ever have that theophany body it's oh my God right yes sir he had to see off anybody yes sir when he died the Bible said that he is a personal pronoun again he went to hell and preached to the souls in prison hallelujah how did he do it he had sensitive feeling he had sensitive hearing he had sensitive speech he had preached with that same kind of body I saw those glorified ones in the other night he preached to the souls that were in hell that repented not in the long suffering in the days of Noah do we really believe that we really believe that that was his soul his being his person do we really believe that that Soul was that theophany that logos that theophany that Son of God that stepped out in the beginning and that's why it caused Jesus Christ the Creator God because he was real what do we think are you number 13. I got 132 33 of Hebrews chapter 4. 57 901e and as we had it the other night brought in the beginning was Spirit then from God went out the Lord gosh or the theophany which was the form of a man called the son of God prefigured he came in Earth in a body of Flesh are you reading or are you sleeping what was that sleep on the son of man's been behind the hand of sinful man he came in Earth in a body of Flesh even before he came in Jesus Christ right now swallow that one once brother all right I'll prove it to you he said see when Moses saw him he said let me Sue your form Lord and God hit him in the rock and when he passed by he said it was the back part of a man that was that theophany that's exactly then that theophany had to be made flesh not another person but the same person had to become flesh to take this thing out of death what about it what about it he came in a body now I've got it in here somewhere we'll get to it he came in a form to Abraham it was called Melchizedek right God in human flesh now watch Melchizedek the guy that ate the calf nerves where you got to be real careful why like Aaron said one time said he just sprinkled if I get this right or wrong you correct it with him he said he just sprinkled that the offney man down over that body and become God in human flesh or maybe the word of Flesh over the theophany body the things the way he was saying it all right you see what kind of a body was he in he was in a theophany he appeared to Moses and I said this morning Moses said Lord I'd love to see you don't you want to see him but yet you failed his presence you've been birthed by his presence you've you've been in in great atmospheres with him around you and I but you want to see him don't you Moses had spoke to him lived to ear mouth to mouth seen him in the burning bush seen him do all the things but he said Lord I love to see you he said just go stand in that Cliff to the Rock remember that was the same one that the water came out of you remember the cleft of The Rock and he went and stood in that cleft of The Rock and when he passed by he was evidently looking this way and when it did he went like that well he saw the back part of the man because he told him he said you can't see my face that no man can see my face he'll die we can see the back part a theophany Abraham sat down and fed Melchizedek meat and milk and bread he said well wait a minute we had a quote director a while ago I'm glad you're thinking you remember the quote that said in theophany you don't eat or drink okay Melchizedek was inside that body the body wasn't Melchizedek the body was just a spoken word into existence and back out of existence in there was the theophany the body of Jesus yep the human body of Jesus was not it's theophany it was a human body but inside of that body that's right dwelt the very God because it wouldn't his body it went to hell it was a soul from the inside of him think about it so let's read this part right here let's go to where who is this Melchizedek 1965. 221 the evening service start with paragraph 67. Now read it very carefully now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body we have not yet entered into the word form body we become the word here so we're going to read we bypassed it which don't mean it was iron we went around it it means it wasn't in existence Jesus came keep this in mind as we read Jesus came word form body theophany fullness around we have not yet entered through the word form body but a theophany twinkle little change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word and an amorphy body speaking of Jesus Christ right he came and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek then later we never heard no more of Melchizedek because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was a priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet simple he came away that he would be the fullest and he would know everything you and I are going to come away that we don't know everything right all right you come like Adam like me you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted when this life is finished here is this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word but now look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God see you can't be the word unless you are a thought you had to be in the thinking first which you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany but now you said your soul is he doesn't talk about Soul being too often anything remember the word he came in a word form body which is the theophany of God we come as human Mortals with a mortal Soul lost and our soul then is our theophany why because it's where you're going after you die come on folks you realize those souls in prison they had a soul right they were dire as a soul if I'm lost and I die I've got a place to go to why because my soul is what I am it's going to live on and can be called a theophany because of theophany means simply the body of God but if I'm born again my soul goes under the altar to wait because it's my theophy I already have it see that's the thing folks that I've tried for 40 something years to get people to get away from I sit back there in that Baptist Church and I long for some way for somebody to help me but I had met God not seen him and I knew that he was real and it wasn't just a well I hope we're going to heaven if we get to heaven we'll be all right but if we don't I guess there's another way somewhere else you can pay your way out if you go to Purgatory you said the Baptist never taught that uh you almost all afternoon you want to talk about baptist Doctrine you know nobody goes to hell anymore they're going to have to do away with it because everybody's going to heaven right that's what I hear all right you paved the parking lot right why that man painted the church he ain't going to hell now you tell me that's any different than giving the money to the priest and him paying you out right right no difference in it right right you're just using different words okay what you see in order to San Temptation you had to buy pasta theology you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father has given me will come to me and I'll raise him up in their last days see you had to be first it had to be something first all right and then you see you come right down the regular line from attribute for the foundation of the world his name is put on the last book of life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear disappear and then he become flesh and return back again who's that speaking of Jesus Christ resurrected that same body in a glorified condition well you bypass the theophany become a flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if it's Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting you take it and answer it we have not yet the bodies go ahead I don't have no time to argue with you but I ain't gonna do it I'm going to try to do the best I can to preach and let that's the Holy Spirit speak to you let's read Brother Anderson would you pull back up second Corinthians 5. and let's read it read it with an understanding of one thing the prophet says we've just proved a point I hope you do you can see it your soul is your theophany if you're a sinner it's where you're going to it's your body you're going to your deity is Satan you're the body of your God because the often means the body of God but if you're born again you're going upward and you already started eternal life as I say and while ago when that prophet of God started talking about eternal life I listen and I ask questions when I was in the Baptist I wanted to know I could read I wanted to know they talked about a god up in heaven or over the sea and I could read it he's not up there I could read Moses saying I could read Paul saying that and I wanted to beat him I got a chance too when I was about 11 years old did you see something that was a rarity to people but all right you don't have to believe me but from that day I wanted to find that God when brother random started talking the voice of the seventh angel when he began to talk about eternal life being here I said Lord that's what I saw he started talking about something that was real to me I didn't want to have to wonder whether I was going to be saved or not have to wait till the Judgment Day for it to be figured out I wanted to know here I still want to know I want to know if I'm right because if I'm wrong and I'll admit it I can be halved all right you see I'm always wondered about God and how real he is talked with him before I had a chance of receiving the Holy Ghost I could feel his presence so much with me until I turned around hard for it more real than you are I don't talk about something I don't know but I don't try to make you build on what I am it won't do a thing to you except one thing you can say well God did deal with a man and he can deal with me too because if you don't believe it that way you don't know what it is but let's read second Corinthians but read it with the understanding are you listening you understand it then when brother says it's up there it's up there but when he says this down here it's down here if you don't have eternal life down here and then have eternal life up there but you have a partial realization I know you don't like the word negative run around and use it he said you have a negative to positive you don't like that so we use it as well he said partial realization you remember the earnest of your inheritance we were on the other night the new birth is the earnest of your inheritance well you know what that means there's more to come so these virtual knowledge tempers facing God Holy Spirit love pulling us so in God's mind this thing's already over so when he writes and his Prophet interprets his Prophet sees it exactly as God sees it you realize that he stood one day and looked and saw the bride right perfect already redeemed already finished right but you know what we're still struggling right so now with the idea that he's right your soul is your theophany because that's the body you're living in your soul that goes to hell if you die if you're not born again it goes under the altar I'm sold under the altar if you're born again so the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world is carrying us one way or the other so let's just read simply read the scripture for we know that means we have a great understanding that if question number one our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were past tense dissolved past tense we have a building of God already and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens now we're not talking about a house right rooms and you know living room bedroom dining room bathroom he ain't talking about that kind of house he said in my father's house or many mansions in my father's kingdom are many palaces watch now for in this we groan we've done got the earnest of our inheritance right the new birth Desiring Earnest We Grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven I love the rest of these scriptures whether you do or not if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked now that's not talking about nudity right odd that Adam and Eve were naked and didn't know it but that's not talking about nudity that's talking about being clothed upon with a house which is from heaven right right a theophany what does the Omni look like and brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time one he recognized his first girlfriend he had maybe he did one he recognized his first wife amen she called him brother he didn't have any trouble knowing who she was why how was she 18 20 year old long black hair probably when she died she was gray-headed I don't know about his first wife I know his second wife was but 18 20 year old you know what it looked like hope didn't look like no what's her name one of the Hope doesn't hope didn't look like media and media didn't look like hope you know what baby came by and he's one of her was talking to him said do you know the reason she's so happy since she was 90 years old but he looked at her nah hey Granny all wrinkled you need to be ironed no he didn't see that that's right he saw 18 20 year old girl so she was 90 years old when she was converted amen that was her soul have you ever heard the prophet say it this way he said when you reach a certain age he said God takes a picture right he said Satan come on take them I said you can't take the life I'm quoting if you'd like it you can't take the life he had the picture what you look like but you know what I love we're gonna get back to predestination you know he made a picture before the foundation of the world that's what he's saying so brother Connie the one that before the foundation world and do you think you're going to look any different when you get here no it was 18 20 years old you're going to look just like that was back there amen right well because you're the same person amen just over into a human flesh I'm not going to look like brother dick and he's not going to look like me do you understand I'm talking about something real why do you think we got the pictures downstairs on the wall are the ones that's passed on I told him I said I want pictures of them 18 20 year old brother Sarah this morning you stand out looking at that Wednesday night I said brother that's a great story there I said those are people that have passed on that went to this church you know her loved ones close I said I want to know what you look like I want to know what you look like brother moat was like me he was already kind of got just a little bit you know and he got a little higher when I first met him not 56. but no 66 excuse me I'll get it right 60 something you see he'd already passed on beyond what God took a picture yeah we got them down there because we want to see them and when they walk in you don't have to be wondering oh sister Ruth she was real sick right at the last laying up in bed at home me and my wife went down to see her and we talked and we sat there and you know had a good time I looked over at my wife with a Carly I said look at her it might have been her eyes I don't know I ain't worried about it but our light a young woman not a sickly workly person at any age or you know burdens of anything she looked like she was about 20 years old baby God just let us see that a little bit ahead you know listen folks when we get Beyond a curtain of time as we pass on before it'll be our soul that goes there in one day 18 20 year old man come walking down through the aisles here but you know what if you're not into Brides you're not going to know that amen and somebody that says like sister Gayle said well there's brother Dale somebody over in a you know somebody else's they get the straight jacket I think we need to get her in a Nut House because they won't see it right don't tell me everybody's going to see it it's odd that brother random always referred to confis was that my right the Caiaphas was the one that said and Abraham and Sarah said we better get out of here they might be we've been recognized how did Caiaphas know what Abraham and Sarah looked like come on get off of it it's kind of odd he used him kind of odd is this morning that he was the high priest under the anointing that he could see things other people couldn't see kind of odd isn't it but is it odd folks but look not trying to get clothes on clothes with our house if you take it and I went down to preach on it because it's 40 years ago where it says in My Father's House were many mansions there are many theophonies why not be one when we get through one of these days get back to Genesis 1 26 and 27 but many theophanes but then Jesus turned around and said I go to prepare place for you brother Brian said we have nothing to do at least in future homes the other day we have nothing to do with the building of the future home there won't be no planting and doing this and doing that and one raise up another he said won't be there he said Jesus is doing every bit of it yep I like that song I'm sending up boards for my mansion in the sky I know it's a carnal story for them but it's not for me I'm sending up boards for my mansion in the sky because I'm going to need all of these virtues when I get there I hope you understand listen just think about it for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened just an Earnest of it for not for that we would be unclothed but closed upon what that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he's telling you what kind of clothes you're putting on what does it matter in eternity whether we have clothes or not we will because there will be others around but what does it matter Adam and Eve didn't know this naked that was the thing God said who told you he was naked me you take away all of this carnality of our minds and you don't have to worry about nudity gonna be a lot of weight loss come that time won't you I love that man you've seen me 18 20 years old it was just a rare pictures of me anyway I don't have a lot because I don't do too good in photographs in order to see me I'm going to stand in there with that old flat top haircut and no shirt on man hanging the baby clothes on the wash line we used to have door stoppers okay the church listen if this early Tabernacle be dissolved the second is dissolved I'm a soldier under the altar you know what I'm doing I'm saying how long really I'm saying church at Lula come on I've tried to teach it to me do you come on get in the word and get me back where I'm supposed to be because I won't be happy to be there even though that would be a great eternity of bliss of beauty and everything but yet those people that are wanting to come back here why because we're people and even though our body is not the real part of us that God is working on it is the part that he placed us in as I said he's not going to have any extra souls and nobodies you're not gonna have extra bodies and no souls he knows exactly what he's doing see I believe your soul then is your theophany in the basis that is is going to take you somewhere if it's a sinner it's going to take you down if it's a Christian it's going to go up right but we already have it here and there's the key you listen for a second please we talked about going to heaven we talked about all that would be in the great Mind by happy hunting grounds all the things But Here Come a prophet talking about eternal life here he said we already have eternal life and that was a day or two for a car run into it and killed him we already have it as far as God is concerned is over with but as far as you and I are concerned it ain't over here yet but it will be he said but I've always thought a theophany would become kind of a Heavenly it he is but a sinner has a place to go to which is his soul it will live on until a Judgment Day but a Christian has a place to go to and that's his soul and that'll live on until one day we'll return to these bodies and when we return to these bodies there ain't going to be no devil just try to stop us he can't fool with a little bride right your soul then is your theophany please go home and think about it don't just cut it off as saying but always bleed my Souls up in heaven I mean my theophthany's up in heaven I just went through an hour and a half telling you that's right because it's the positive of God's mind that's pulling us I'll give you a split second just to look at it was a man stood on this Earth one time his name was Jesus it was God Almighty and flesh you agree one day Matthew 17 I guess it is he went up on the mountain and he was transfigured the almighty God out of heaven spoke and said this is my son the police to dwell in here are you him he was shown brother Branham said his second coming Matthew 27 5 27 in there where it talks about that's literally taking you to but around uses it for here ye him when he said I know to you theologians and things this is the scripture speaking of his second coming in his second coming would be Moses and Elijah and Jesus to the Jews but he said it's prefigured here when God sees anything it's already finished he said I will put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman I've already done it it's already finished we got to live out the acts of the play gotta remember and who's this male Saturday we're put here to be tempted and tested let's see is it is it the unveiling God or Roberta Brown said that he put his bride here to prove to Satan that she would fall like that first bride did right and you know to prove it he's got to put us through the test right the only way we prove to Satan is for him to be able to challenge us but remember he can't defeat us you say well you could die in a split second brother Dale why is your unbelief there go don't write on my Tombstone I died come on it's right on there that I took a little journey to wait on you and one day I'll meet you somewhere in the air and see I don't want to do that I want to be here for the change let's stand come on brothers I want to be here for the change I want to be here to see death annihilated as I told you many many times where the moat told me one day he said brother Dale we got to find out what death is before we can talk about it being destroyed death is not dying going by the grave death is the carnality of our human mind the carnality of your human mind go home today 73 years old go home today sit down on the couch and say well I'm tired I ain't gonna do nothing else next day I ain't going to buy me something to eat it won't take just a few days and you're going to be bringing me something to eat down at the nursing home or the hospital one but fight it out with him oh he comes and hits me and he hits me hard and when he does I said hang on little boy you're going to see this body changed and if you can take it to the Grave they ain't got nothing to do with it why because I have eternal life what do we got brother 392 anybody have a need any questions and answers I'm not always I don't present everything the best way I know but any questions and answers bring them and let's talk about them I love them go ahead brother around us you know I like being real or need just a thought that you have there is everybody and do the same but the prophet said he let some people where they can be a witness to be a witness do you allowed that to happen to be a witness we can Witness God anybody have a name Jesus believe and let's see for the sale knocked down by the dog today and the dog trying
