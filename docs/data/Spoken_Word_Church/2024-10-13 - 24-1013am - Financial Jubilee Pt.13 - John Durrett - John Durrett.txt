========================================

praise the Lord amen you glad to be in God's house this morning amen well let's go to the Lord in word of prayer this morning precious Lord we thank you so much father once again for bringing us to your house Lord and we can just gather in your name father and hear from you and receive what you have for us Lord we pray you bless your people throughout this day Lord Jesus and we invite you now Lord just to take control have preeminence Lord help me to say the things you want me to say and Lord the things that shouldn't be said May those things not be said Lord we love you bless the rest of the service bless our pastor Lord Jesus on this special day just uh we thank you thank you for his life thank you for his service Lord Jesus we commit the rest of this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord amen well I thank the lord it's been a a minute seems since I've been before you and uh always honored always nervous my uh kids are asked me well you know what what makes you nervous well that it flows that's the key you know and I always pray you know Lord what what do you want me to say how can I say it you put it all together so that's what I'm praying this morning the Lord will do as we talk about financial Jubilee part 13 debt free heyen and I was you know thinking this morning you know um as I was praying just kind of preparing you know I thank God that he he made me free you know he paid a price for me when I was um 21 years old uh when I accepted that uh and um freed me from habits from send what I thought was Freedom you know I thought it was free I thought I was free especially growing up in this message I thought I was free to listen to what I wanted to listen to do what I wanted to do hang out with who I wanted to hang out and man I I remember coming into what I thought was that type of Freedom like man I'm getting older I'm getting I can do what I want to Dad is not as strong as he used to be you know hey we can we can handle this you know and um certainly that sin just started accumulating and um but God but God Amen he made the difference all all together all right it's my first time using this so let's see if we can get this going all right so you know we have talked about you know we spent a lot of time on financial Jubilee so I I hope and pray that you have been working on it you know and um pressing on I've enjoyed the testimonies that I've gotten from from some of you the victories that you've had and um I thank the Lord for that you know and I also heard some of the struggles that some of you have had but I like to say now I'm not the debt police so no tickets coming from me but I do hope through the word of God that you can see something that will give you the inspiration that you need on this journey the word says for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and cth the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it less happily after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man begin to build and was not able to finish my my my so it's counting the cost counting the cost to everything that we do you know and building on that Foundation that God has started in your life you know when God got a hold of me you know I I didn't understand everything and still continuing to learn because we're building something in this day we're building something you know it's not just God getting a hold of us and that's it he's building something in in us all of us and we have to take our time we got to slow things down I like to think of our Prophet you know we talked about the uh the Indian hunter that he was hunting with and brother Brenham was real hyped up you know trying to get to the top of the mountain where the elk was that's what he wanted to get there and the Indian was saying you know you got to slow down Down Slow Down slow down and brother Bren like oh we got to keep going he said he slowed down a little bit the Indian was saying that was still too fast he said he started walking the Indian was like that's still too fast and brother Brenham I love to hear him say he said the elk is up there that's what he told the Indian and the Indian told him they're El born there they've been there and he said you know what that he had some right truth in that and he told him he said look the Indian said you got to walk him once to look nine times amen and that just tells us to slow things down you know our life can get so out of CA cater we get into chaos and sometimes it becomes like you can't undo it but for the grace of God so we have to slow down we don't have to be in a rush with the Lord that's one wonderful thing about the Lord and we can learn what he wants from us to build on this Foundation that he has for us you know we're building something in the Lord you know we know the precious promises that he has for us we're building towards something and we have to learn how to build as we talked about last time counting the cost and um go back and listen to that you know planning your spending being slow enough to understand it and the world is designed to make it very complicated you know but a simple plan I talked about last time if your cash and your money is out of C there simple way get the cash out the bank put it in an envelope for the categories of EXP expenses that you have take the cash out of the envelope when the envelope is empty stop spending man if you did that from when you were young my my my but see that's how simple God is with his word it's a very simple plan but the Devil comes along makes things very complicated makes it very complicated and God wants us to rest in the Simplicity of his word that's his desire to rest in the Simplicity of his word but we have an enemy that we have to fight that's bringing all kind of different voices different conversations different thoughts that's his goal to try to bring along something that's more complicated until you get lost in it but remember that plan remember a simple plan anything that works that allows you to not spend more than you make is the start of the journey when you're talking about money that's the start of it I was telling the kids the other day you know and I'm sure I've said it before you know I I was 16 years old went into I think it was JC Pennies or Sears they had a $250 VCR I didn't have a dime but they told me they have credit cards I was like okay I signed up told me you are approved man I felt like oh my goodness I am growing up man I brought that $250 VCR home oh man I thought it was golden I don't know what happened to it but I don't know if I paid it off but that goes to show that was the devil's tactic getting me started in the wrong direction right so you know why Financial Jubilee you know what why how hearing recognizing and acting that's what it's about you know and I I always talk about financial Jubilee and you might say John what why you know you you seem to bring this all the time because I think it's something that we spend all our life dealing with and I think if we can see what God is trying to say in it then we can see it in the bigger picture I think young people can see it old people can see it middle-age anybody can see it and you can see what God is intending for for us and we can learn how to fight on this journey of money and with the greater things that God has for us so Financial Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free right so we're free in our finances we're free in this word of God if we want to go free if we want to go free that's very important but we are free and that's the message that God is telling us that we're free you know and I think God has done something very special in this church I mean it's one of the only churches that I heard that the pastor put the church and offered him to go through learning about Dave Ramsey and his teachings and things like that and that to me is amazing so why why God has done this here for this church why because God has a plan right he has a very special plan and we can take that and receive that he wants us to know we're free in all areas of our life why is that important if we can be faithful in the unrighteous thing like money then God will commit to us true riches right amen and that's the journey we want those true riches I mean we have an amazing message with Promises of true riches we see the examples in the word of God we know what God is trying to do he's trying to prepare a bride for himself that we can be so close to him when he comes to give us that true and full Revelation we're that close that the shadow becomes the hand that's what he says right so he's trying trying to prepare us in all areas of our life so we want those true riches that's what I'm after the true riches that God has promised for all of us amen but how are we going to do it I wish it was easy I wish you didn't have to train and I wish you didn't have to fight but you do and that's one thing being around this message all my life you know I I've seen two sides of it there's one side that's talks about this rest and it almost feels like you don't have to do anything you don't have to do anything but rest but I can tell you if you're thinking about rest in that way you're thinking about the world side of rest this is not a cruise ship as brother Wade always says it's not that kind of rest where you put your feet up and hey God is going to get me out of all of this I don't need to learn anything my my my you are in a world of trouble no you have to train and you have to fight amen and I learned that after coming to this word after being free from my sins there was a lot and still a lot I have to learn right every day training and learning we have to train and we learn have to learn and our Prophet says and so an Army first in getting ready for battle first they've got to be selected some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting amen that's him telling us that we've got to be trained we got to be dressed and guess what you've been selected right you all have been selected for this battle so we can train amen now there is a rest there's a rest in God's promises that's where we're resting and believing but we have to fight our way through this world and become Overcomers in this world but we do believe in his word as the rest that is the rest that it's talking about but not on this life's journey no no no it's a fight every day all the time amen and the word says let be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready she's prepared she's gotten herself ready what God brings in your path he wants you to learn and grow and to overcome and to make yourself ready praise the Lord Jesus amen I just want to pause and thank the Lord for something my wife and I you know it was uh years ago that she made herself ready just this week she made herself ready to be my bride I wasn't there she was staying with her mom in the hotel and getting prepared and I thank God I want to just recognize the lord gave us 25 years of marriage amen praise the Lord Jesus that's his grace and uh we both come from broken backgrounds and uh you know all the stats are stacked against us tell you they stacked against us but not with him that's right amen but we have to overcome amen both her and I we fight we try not to fight each other but we fight we fight to overcome all of the train all of the the garbage the background all of the strains it's almost like a daily thing we deal with because it's in us you know we've seen it we've seen family members walk away marriages broken on all sides that's what we' see that that's almost normal exactly so by God's grace we're creating new patterns by his grace so I'm rejoicing in the fact that the lord gave me 25 years of marriage that's his grace Amen to have done that and that's everything see we are indebted because of our past you know not just my parents they come with a history with a bad history past we all come from that history coming on down coming on down strains jeans all this stuff all the way back to our mom e all the way back all of us and that's in us and that's what we're trying to overcome in this hour all of the things so when we get born again that's the beginning that is the beginning you're now entering into the fight to overcome Amen to rest in his word but to train and learn and apply it to make ourselves ready amen for that hour that we know we know we're that close to so it's time to get ready in all areas of our life amen AB amen that's why this this one scripture means so much to me clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus says get all things off your hand get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen amen the time is now to make ready get ready clean your lives up heyen get it to where it's simple enough that you can have this this peace in your life to serve God to ask him Lord reveal more to me and you have some space for him to reveal more to you amen we need that space amen not only all of the negative stuff that's been stacked against us but think about the things that we should be building on Amen all of the history everything has come down to this hour all of the wisdom all of the word our Prophet his message all of it has come right down to today amen we've never been here today any of us but here we are with this revealed word these promises all stacked amen that we can take advantage of heyen I told you last time as I'm building on my family and where my dad comes from and slavery my granddad was a slave and we're building on all of that amen so when I see God moving it gives me strength that I don't have to go out and apply for this debt and get this debt and do this no I already got so much Lord let me handle these great things that you've already given me the fact that I have a wife for 45 years Lord let me handle that let me enjoy that by your grace why don't I need a car on debt when I have this when I have kids that are doing the best that they can by God's grace and they still there they still listen they still want to be home praise God lord Jesus I don't have time to sign up for this or that this debt no Lord I have time to get on my knees and pray for my children I don't need anything complicated in my life I need it as simple as God can have it so I can make ready and get ready and that's what we all need to do make ready get ready we know something is happening but the devil has so many things around us that we're so crowded and clouded that we can't get to that freedom that's right amen but God wants us to be free amen and that's why I believe our Prophet brought this say pay your debts get it right Make Ready amen and i' say come on you got something to do God just don't poke things down your neck you've got to believe it you've got to do some fighting see that's the fight the fight to believe it you're fighting to believe these promises that God has given us and I believe that after you fight God gives you things to let you see yes he's at work so I'm a firm believer if you apply these financial principles you see God working he starts stacking and you start saying oh Lord you are true you're true to all your promises amen that's what I tell my kids and my son and seeing him see God moving his life I'm like praise the Lord so you sing you sing the world is a liar the dev devil is a liar God is truth he wants the best thing for everybody he doesn't want you to have the broke downam things and everything oh bro that's not his goal his goal is for you to have the best as long as you can manage the best for his glory that's his desire but we got to believe it and we got to fight to keep that type of mentality remember the principles God owns it all he owns it he controls it he provides it do we believe that do we believe that he really owns it he controls that he provides it if we really believe that then we should never have to enter into debt we shouldn't have to do that if if we truly believe it now that's not easy in this world I know it's not easy in this world because it says like oh my goodness I maybe it's changed maybe God has changed you know and the world has gotten so complicated God can't deal with it anymore we got to kind of go the world's way do do we think that I used to think that I used to think that I I actually remember coming up in a message home and I had brothers and sisters and not just money but we would talk like you know that you used to could maintain your Purity you used to but it's not like that anymore you know you used to could do these type of thing and keep your life clean but it's kind of too complicated now so we kind of have to compromise a little bit more and go to way the world goes God understands no his word is here the precious promises the true riches that he has for us that hasn't changed that's why you can come along and says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever letting you know don't change my word is true not to keep you bound but to keep you actually free that's what he wants you to do to see him in everything amen so he's faithful with his part it's our part we run into the trouble we are stewards we got to be diligent we got to be faithful that's what's required of us avoid debt like the curse the blessing of the Lord and maketh with and he added no sorrow with it we have to avoid this thing amen and I don't stand here you know proud I I made many mistakes many and in every way made mistakes amen and I had to learn I had to come overcome I had to grow and again I still learning still overcoming but once I started learning what God wants from us that's what I try to avoid so I know debt is a terrible thing God does not want that for his people if we made mistakes there is a way out and I thank God because this message is packed packed with vitamins to help us get out of things that we get ourselves tangled up into amen praise God no the world is full of advertisements and television radio newspapers and the American people fall for such as that and if the American people fall for such as that amen we we have to learn we got to learn and and and with the word of God and every day he's preaching he's bringing the word of God to us you know it's up to us to apply it okay and then we should be feeling something if we're still alive and that's what I said you know brother Dale bringing the church through financial peace from Dave Ramsey and things like that and you know all of this you know it's up to us to apply it's up to us to say you know what you know I may have made some mistakes but I'm going forward I'm I'm done I'm done I'm done and Lord help me with the mistakes that I have made right okay amen and that's the same thing in every area of your life and everything right you know you make mistakes kids make mistakes all those types of things but you can get to a point by God's grace and say you know what no more no more Lord I'm I'm going to start fighting I'm going to start proving you in your word Lord Lord is your way better you know we we shouldn't be afraid of this word you know I like to tell my wife this if your product is good you don't have to be a worried you know and it seems the world is trying to make us feel worried even for our children as if if what we have is not good it's great it's wonderful you know that is the message that we need to bring that we are free daddy is free and nothing is going to steal my joy okay nothing is going to steal my joy because who gave it God gave it to me that's right so I'm happy yes the only concern I have for my children let me tell you is that they don't get to see the blessings that God has for them that's it right because I know it's better I know it's a better way I know it is the way and Jesus says I am the way the truth in the Life what do that mean in every single thing you're not going to find better advice from God but from God there's nothing you can seek better on how to live how to have your marriage how to raise your children how to walk in this journey from youth to death but through this word of God there is no way there is no better way he's safe and concluding I am the way the truth and the life done deal you can spend your life searching you're going to come right back yes sir so it's up to us as parents or those who are a little bit more seasoned to Hold Steady hold strong heyen Challenge fight yourself I know it gets you down and you see these things your children and family oh no let them see Mama and Daddy we good we got something that's precious you can only go but you're going to come right back because it's good amen we sad for you we ain't sad we're not down in the dumps no right we want you to have it too heyen we have billions that's how I feel with this journey and this word we have billions why are we worried why but that's the devil's goal to put your word aside your kids don't have nothing to look at you're sad you're down in the dumps I wonder they can walk off somewhere else because they get you caught up in this little twist instead of no Daddy's fine I love you this word is true kids I that's it we happy we enjoying dinner amen praise God we're not down amen we are winning people by his grace we have won through Jesus Christ amen the money God we talked a little bit about this you get your income you you give for tith you should your taxes your living debt that comes in picture on the journey early top section is what we call short-term money plans the bottom section is the long-term money plans and most people never get there because the enemy has a tactic and he tries to get you right there you start living in your debt you start Bal you get right caught up in there and you may spend the rest of your life never able to get to what we call true investing where you can do things with money that's very different right okay and that's the same way with the word of God if the devil can get us caught up and we become ineffect effective in our walk Born Again Believers but ineffective caught up in this trap can never get to the things that God can use you in a way that you may not even can imagine today amen and we have to come to something we have to come to something that God has promised us that we know we're in some type of vow right where we manifest what we've been talking about for years amen amen and that's the same thing with money if we can get through that and avoid that and get out of that then we can get to somewhere with money and again it's just an example of the precious promises that we can get to in the Lord amen God's GPS on Deb he says oh no man but to love one another for he that loveth another has fulfill the law the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrow is servant slave to the lender the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give thee rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand amen and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow amen look what God intended for the Jews in that scripture Deuteronomy 28 he said hey I'm going to bless the work of your hands he wanted the Jews to stand out as a special people where God is doing the providing and they're being that example that the world can look to and is no different for us today God intends for us to stand out as a special people not caught up with the way of the world showing that God provides right amen showing that we have this joy we have everything we have need of that's what he wants the world to see right amen and in order to do that remember we got to train and we got to fight to do it amen yes sir debt lies the world is full of it visa says it's all it takes Visa also says it's all you need discover says it pays to discover Master Carter you can imagine what that is already about it Masters you am so you have to avoid the way of the world and these are small things now you just get on the internet you can find some of everything my son I we always joke about it now and talk we actually went to a meeting and they were yelling they said OPM that's the way to do it OPM means other people's money you know and they were saying CH OPM OPM say it that's the only way OPM my goodness other people's money so him and I joke about it because now he got some wisdom he's like my goodness I can't believe they're saying that amen so it's full of it and all of the tactics are there the devil's job is to get you looking at one thing that you may lack forgetting about everything that you have right and making you doubt that you can get the things that you lack that's his goal I told him I said hey most of the time and we don't argue we don't hurt about anybody you know we we understand we understand a lot of times we just don't believe don't believe we can get to it don't believe we can save enough money to get to the car that we want we don't believe it maybe God is don't bless me like that so I got to go to Mastercard or this card dealer with a loan because I I don't believe for me it don't come that way I got to go this way no don't believe those lies man if you if the devil got that lie then you know God has his truth on the other side and that's where you have to fight to hold on to that all right as we come down I I wanted to share this path to being debt free vitamin packed from our Prophet I love the word of God because it's full of everything that you have need of so as we get ready to close I want to give you these vitamins from the message of the hour amen our Prophet says I went thousands of dollars in Deb and paid it back at a dollar a week but by God's grace I've got it paid amen so we can apply the pattern from the prophet amen it's so wonderful praise God getting debt free it's in Christ's revealed in his own word and you can go back you can go and listen to experts but I'm telling you it is lined up it's jammed packed in this message brother beram says as my duty to God I owe him my tithes I want to pay him my Tidings first amen so you got to continue to give and honor the true Master even if you're in debt you still need to pay your tithe then my next duty is to pay my debt that's right before spending investing pay your debts pay your debts now he's going to give you how because you well I still got to pay my bill yes if you can't pay you know more than 25 cents on that bill each pay payday every income should receive a portion should be dedicated to paying off that debt right every piece if it's just 25 cents that's all I have after my bills I got 25 yep that needs to go before I start getting something else that I want pay that portion says I'll come by and tell you about it I'll tell you if I can't do it this time never run from your creditors run towards them tell them you're nothing to hide you're doing the best that you can tell them I got a little bit this time hey I'll pay you but you're talking you're sharing you're talking about it now by the help of God I paid out every bit of it amen notice he said by the help of God pray for God's help and in time it will be repaid amen pay pray for his help just set your goal set the target I want to do this Lord I want to free myself up I want to be free I need your help he's there to help you can't pay him go tell him say I owe you and I'm going to pay you there you go and remember it's on God's books too you know that you do amen remember so you can't just walk away from these things so the wicked Borth and payeth not again but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth our Prophet is saying it's on God God books too that's why he's saying clean your lives up pay your debts get everything right make ready get ready he's telling you he says I'm trying to for myself and for all of us together try to be ready for we know we're getting near something he said I'm trying I'm trying I'm telling you I'm trying for myself trying for all of you and we're all trying together amen that's why I love the testimonies of the people coming and say hey you know what I'm I'm out of debt amen this is the last thing I got it's like heyen praise the Lord amen and that's where we want to be with the word of God just encouraging each other like am man I'm pressing on you know hey how are your kids doing I'm praying for your kids pray for mine amen we we know it's a battle we don't have to be perfect we're not perfect none of us he is perfect amen so we can be ourselves and say hey pray for one another let's get through this we're in This Together by God's grace so we want to be ready when the coming of the Lord is drawing so nigh now we want to be ready for that great hour don't continue living in bondage getting free from dead is getting ready for his coming our Lord wants you with no Financial leans to another I I believe that I believe the Lord wants us where we are free people yes we're free people we're not tied down to anything we don't owe anyone anything and we ready ready to go amen that's what God's desire for all of us the musicians can get ready to come on up you know and that's truly what he's doing trying to get us free trying to get us ready for this hour that we live in we're down to the end we know that amen amen and by God's grace I want us to be able to see him in everything you know to see uh the view not from the world's view you know and that's part of what I what I enjoy about financial Jubilee I know the young people coming up you know and money is like it can be sometime everything but I believe if they can see God working in these areas of their life it giv gives him confidence confidence in this word of God that we have if he can do it in this little thing of Mamon moneyy little thing then he can do it in the greater things and if I can get that across to all of us and remind myself of that all the time that God is faithful he set us free he brought us all together my my my my my and in conclusion he says we are free from sin amen we're free from the shackles we're free from Habits we are free from smoking drinking carousing because the Son of God has raised from the grave and has broke every feather my God we are free people praise His name all condemnation think about this word is setting us free condemnation is gone we can stand as Free People the debt has been paid the penalty is paid the sins are washed away and we are free oh we are free people praise the Lord God bless [Applause] you amen
