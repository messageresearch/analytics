[12:53] you need to be singing
[12:56] if you don't sing for us name for the
[12:58] lord
[12:59] okay but if you sing it for us then you
[13:01] sing it to the lord so that's okay
[13:03] but good good job girls
[13:06] and gentlemen that was really good we
[13:07] appreciate that that's one of the most
[13:08] favorite songs
[13:10] reason it is is is if it's not well
[13:12] you're sold today then you got a problem
[13:16] but that man that went through that song
[13:19] you ought to read it
[13:22] if he can stand in his day and lose his
[13:26] family
[13:30] under dwight moody's ministry which is
[13:33] good but not the ministry like we got
[13:37] the faith that
[13:38] we got but the faith he had he said
[13:44] though satan should buff it
[13:46] we think we have trials
[13:49] he lost his whole family all but his
[13:51] wife
[13:52] lost his whole family lost it lost a lot
[13:53] of money in chicago chicago fire i think
[13:55] he went bankrupt
[13:58] very wealthy man horatio spafford was
[14:02] but can you set in your study
[14:06] and say it is well
[14:08] with my soul
[14:10] it's well
[14:11] all is well
[14:13] i love that song all as well
[14:15] we've heard this message shalom
[14:18] and all is well
[14:20] there is a place of perfect rest
[14:23] behind the inner veil
[14:26] rest a little bride rest
[14:29] for all as well
[14:30] and man by way of announcement remember
[14:32] brother luis will be speaking for us
[14:34] wednesday night
[14:36] brother bob is still at brother richard
[14:37] wilson just remember them
[14:39] after we have communion and foot washing
[14:41] this afternoon we'll meet downstairs in
[14:43] the middle room
[14:44] those of you that are going to ohio
[14:47] we need to just get some pencil
[14:49] sharpening and what we need to bring and
[14:51] what time and all that
[14:53] we need to just get it together all
[14:54] right and also
[14:56] they remember
[14:57] the key three to be here with us on the
[14:58] seventh we are going to the camp meeting
[15:00] if anybody'd like to go we're our
[15:02] our car is full we don't have the ban
[15:04] anymore but if you'd like to go we're
[15:05] going on thursday
[15:07] and come back on friday we always like
[15:08] to support brother joe green
[15:10] and his efforts and uh
[15:13] there in ruth or rutherfordton
[15:15] north carolina so just remember that in
[15:17] your prayers listen to this
[15:19] the fundamental foundations of faith
[15:21] listen in 1955 the prophet of god says
[15:24] so i believe this with all my heart
[15:27] i believe that we're nearing the age
[15:28] that when people are going to recognize
[15:30] these things
[15:32] that we've had so much vain philosophy
[15:35] and so forth and teachings that ought
[15:37] not to be
[15:38] wow it's 1955.
[15:41] until it has set the human mind to a
[15:44] revolution of thinking on matters of
[15:46] this and that and taking away from the
[15:48] word of god
[15:50] listen to this
[15:52] as i've said faith doesn't come by
[15:54] fasting
[15:56] everybody believe brother brown was the
[15:58] prophet right all right got the right
[15:59] crowd
[16:00] faith doesn't come by praying
[16:05] reading a book
[16:07] all of that's good
[16:09] fasting praying and reading reading a
[16:11] book but faith comes by a settled
[16:13] something that's in the human heart
[16:17] that tells you just as sure as you come
[16:20] to this church tonight
[16:22] when you come home you told your wife
[16:25] that you'd be home after the service was
[16:26] over
[16:27] you do that unconsciously
[16:32] you must go out and get in your car and
[16:34] go home
[16:35] now
[16:36] you could not do it unless you have
[16:38] faith
[16:39] you could do it
[16:40] look how simple that is
[16:43] you'd never move from where you're
[16:45] sitting if you didn't have faith that
[16:47] you could raise up
[16:49] but you've done it so much and you just
[16:51] become so accustomed to those laws till
[16:54] it's a natural
[16:55] thing faith
[16:57] is a natural thing
[16:59] if you're a believer today
[17:02] your faith
[17:04] should be as common and natural
[17:07] as you getting in the car and
[17:09] turning the key and going to the house
[17:11] that's what the prophet said
[17:13] fasting's good
[17:15] praying is good
[17:17] and reading a book's good but faith
[17:19] comes from a subtle something that's in
[17:21] the human heart
[17:23] the soul
[17:24] not this thing the soul
[17:26] in your soul that's why it is well
[17:29] if it's not well with your soul today
[17:30] guess what it's all unsettled everything
[17:32] you got turmoil you got strife you got
[17:34] all the we got enough of that in the
[17:35] world
[17:36] but there's a subtle piece that a
[17:38] christian should have
[17:40] as uh brother spafford when he went
[17:42] across the river went across the ocean
[17:44] and the captain said right here is where
[17:45] your daughters
[17:47] met their death
[17:49] and that's when he penned
[17:52] no trials will come
[17:56] rest assurance
[17:59] is in control
[18:00] it is well
[18:02] it is well
[18:03] with my soul we think we have problems
[18:06] now you ain't have problems
[18:08] not when you've lost half of your family
[18:10] job had a problem
[18:12] job lost everything he had in just a few
[18:14] days
[18:14] but you know what he said i know
[18:18] my redeemer living so let's buy our
[18:19] heads dear lord thank you for the status
[18:21] you give us
[18:22] thank you for the wonderful music songs
[18:25] the worship father and
[18:27] we've done all those things and today
[18:29] lord we're going to hear from you just
[18:31] for a moment lord then we're going to
[18:32] institute communion and foot washing
[18:34] lord
[18:35] and we pray that you would be in all
[18:37] that that you would be in our service
[18:39] today lord as an active participant lord
[18:42] that you would go deep down into the
[18:43] heart and that you would strike the
[18:45] heart of man
[18:47] lord and change us lord
[18:49] we are coming to a body change but we
[18:51] have to be changed in our soul first
[18:54] there has to be a longing and a desire
[18:56] for the word of god before you can even
[18:58] help us
[18:59] and lord i pray that today that we will
[19:01] desire you not worry about this one or
[19:04] that one or the other who's looking at
[19:05] me and who don't care about me and who's
[19:07] not watching and who's watching and
[19:08] who's sitting beside me and who's not
[19:10] coming and who's coming and what kind of
[19:11] clothes they got on him
[19:13] no
[19:16] he said it as well with my soul
[19:20] i don't know about somebody else's but
[19:22] is he well
[19:24] with your soul tonight
[19:26] that's the question you need to ask in
[19:27] the name of the lord jesus
[19:29] amen
[19:31] in the beginning was the word and where
[19:32] was with god and the word was god
[19:35] and the word was made flesh
[19:37] and dwelt among us
[19:39] you know i was thinking
[19:40] this right here you see the statue of a
[19:42] perfect man
[19:44] that was in the flesh of god
[19:48] hello somebody
[19:51] the son of man's one that displayed
[19:52] those
[19:54] so the word was made flesh
[19:56] and dwelt among us and then brother
[19:58] brown says as we grow into the statue of
[19:59] perfect man guess what we are the word
[20:01] made flesh
[20:03] all right the son of man in the end time
[20:05] and the bride and be not conformed to
[20:06] this world but be transformed by the
[20:08] renewing of your mind we'll try to get
[20:10] to that this afternoon that you may
[20:13] prove now not god but you
[20:15] that ye may prove
[20:17] what is that good and acceptable and
[20:19] perfect will of god for i say through
[20:21] the grace given unto me to every man
[20:22] that's among you
[20:24] not to think of himself more highly than
[20:26] he ought to think
[20:27] you know the prophet of god told us that
[20:30] we're supposed to reverence the office
[20:33] right
[20:34] but we're no more than just servants
[20:36] we've got to understand that if you have
[20:37] an office in this church you're a
[20:39] servant you're not some hierarchy you're
[20:41] not some high falutin somebody
[20:43] we actually are servants to you
[20:46] what you desire today you're going to
[20:48] pull out of a servant
[20:49] what you desire
[20:51] your soul is going to pull the spirit
[20:53] that i was talking about those spirits
[20:54] you we can either get rid of the bad
[20:56] ones and then entertain the good ones
[20:58] the bible says sometimes we entertain
[21:00] what angels unaware
[21:02] why because we can't see any other
[21:03] dimension but we can see the effects of
[21:05] what's going on
[21:07] by what you think by what you do
[21:10] and that's what we're going to talk
[21:11] about confession
[21:12] and possession according as god has
[21:14] dealt every man the measure
[21:16] of faith so there is a measure of faith
[21:18] for as we have many members in one body
[21:20] and all members have not the same office
[21:22] so we be many are one body in christ and
[21:24] everyone remembers one of another
[21:27] having then gifts differing according to
[21:29] the grace that is given to us whether
[21:31] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[21:33] the proportion or portion in other words
[21:36] the proportion of faith you've been
[21:37] given
[21:38] amen because you're not given i'm not
[21:40] giving brother dardy's portion he's
[21:42] given his portion he has a portion of
[21:44] god that he's got to fulfill that i
[21:46] can't fulfill and man brother brown said
[21:48] when the bride realizes who she is and
[21:50] what she's doing here get out of
[21:52] ephraim's cornfield if you're not
[21:53] supposed to raise corn get over in your
[21:54] wheat field stay out of ephraim's field
[21:57] ephraim grows corn
[21:59] we need to get over here and grow our
[22:00] wheat if that's what we're supposed to
[22:01] do instead of everybody wanting to be
[22:03] preachers and everybody wanting to be
[22:04] this nobody wants to be that
[22:06] just get your just getting your job just
[22:08] get in your office and stay there that's
[22:10] what god wants so you may be seeing the
[22:11] lord as blessing to the reading of the
[22:13] word
[22:14] and we're going to go through this
[22:15] pretty quick we've already been through
[22:16] the firs the stages i this morning
[22:19] as as i keep bringing this back and keep
[22:22] going over and over again it seems like
[22:24] there's more
[22:25] people getting more
[22:27] every time that we bring in
[22:29] justification and sanctification and the
[22:31] baptism of the holy ghost there's little
[22:33] points or little things that you didn't
[22:35] cover before that you're covering now so
[22:37] i love god when because he knows we're
[22:39] human beings we're only going to get so
[22:40] much
[22:41] we're only going to get so much of the
[22:42] word of god and then the rest of it's
[22:44] going to fade away or like we said
[22:46] before we read a really good book well i
[22:49] read that book you know children are
[22:50] lightweight cement well i can kind of
[22:52] paraphrase it but i can't read it to you
[22:54] not from my i don't have a photographic
[22:56] memory neither do most of you
[22:59] have one either so we have to be told we
[23:01] have to be preached to
[23:03] we have to be shepherded we have to have
[23:05] the shepherd listen if a shepherd will
[23:07] get his sheep right to start with when
[23:09] they're little
[23:10] he's got a lot less problem with it when
[23:12] they get bigger so we thank god we had a
[23:14] good shepherd
[23:17] still got a good shepherd
[23:19] [Applause]
[23:22] his hook was soft
[23:27] mine may not be
[23:29] but if you've known how to take this
[23:32] the good one
[23:33] maybe you can deal with me for a little
[23:34] while but we good foundation folks good
[23:37] foundation you hear what brother ryan
[23:39] said remember a long time ago i told you
[23:41] i said brother adam said that teaching
[23:43] settles the church
[23:45] teaching if you'll take that teaching
[23:47] right it will you say well we'll just
[23:49] sit there and listen and we're right no
[23:51] there can be some amen and then some
[23:52] shouting and every once in a while we
[23:54] get happy and we go to screaming every
[23:55] once in a while but
[23:57] but you know what it's a deep settled
[23:58] feeling in your soul
[24:01] in your soul
[24:03] your soul is either faith or doubt
[24:04] there's no emotion
[24:08] it's faith or doubt
[24:10] the emotion is in the memories and
[24:11] conscious effects and imagination the
[24:13] spirit realm is where your emotion comes
[24:15] from and that emotion though is driven
[24:18] by what's inside
[24:20] that's why they that
[24:21] that horatio spafford he could out of
[24:23] his now his humanity he was a broken man
[24:28] his spirit was broke
[24:31] lost all of his income he was an
[24:33] insurance agent or something i think it
[24:34] was or something or an investment in
[24:36] chicago lost all that
[24:38] lost his family inside he probably was a
[24:40] broken man but way down deep inside i
[24:44] believe he had a new birth for his time
[24:46] he didn't know a prophet
[24:48] he come under dwight moody's message
[24:51] which is a reformer not a restorative
[24:53] restorer like we got now the prophet
[24:55] brought to restore all things
[24:57] dwight moody was under reformation which
[24:59] is fine
[25:01] and then he will be we'll see him again
[25:05] and we'll talk to him and he'll probably
[25:07] say i don't know how i wrote that song
[25:10] and the condition i was in i don't know
[25:12] he said but something
[25:14] something rose up
[25:16] that i don't even know
[25:18] why i did it but we do
[25:20] because he wrote one of the most
[25:21] beautiful songs that's ever been that's
[25:23] ever been sung
[25:25] he said i don't know why
[25:28] you know why it was for us
[25:30] it was the pull that we had in this end
[25:32] time to say it as well
[25:35] with my soul and then we talked this
[25:36] morning about sanctification
[25:38] how that the unclean spirit goes out
[25:40] walks in dry places we've been through
[25:42] that and remember i want you to
[25:44] understand about that new spirit that
[25:45] new spirit is something that people are
[25:47] going to have to be able to see
[25:52] you can't just say oh i got a new spirit
[25:54] not no when you get a new spirit look
[25:56] that spirit isn't god's spirit we know
[25:57] that that's your spirit but what he's
[25:59] doing he's softening up your spirit
[26:01] so that he can give you the holy spirit
[26:03] now if you'll come in those three stages
[26:05] you're fine
[26:08] but if you stop at number two you're not
[26:10] if you stop at sanctification think well
[26:12] i've got this great uh and most people
[26:15] i'm sorry but most people that's what
[26:17] you see because somewhere down the line
[26:20] they're gonna fall off
[26:22] because they have nothing to hold them
[26:23] they don't have a tie post they think
[26:25] they might have one
[26:26] but they don't have a typos and i'm
[26:28] sorry no and not everybody's gonna make
[26:30] it but i'm gonna preach like everybody's
[26:32] gonna make it now man
[26:34] because i it's not my it's not me to
[26:36] divide you all up it's god
[26:39] knows your heart
[26:41] and knowing your heart he knows what
[26:42] you're going to do but we'll get to it
[26:43] in a minute because of your confession
[26:46] if you confess you can't be healed you
[26:48] know what there's no way you could pour
[26:50] 55 gallons of jesus's own blood on top
[26:52] of your head and you will not get healed
[26:55] you've got to confess as sister freda
[26:57] did this morning and i've done in the
[27:00] past and you probably should practice it
[27:02] a little bit more
[27:04] to confess your faults i'll read it in
[27:05] the bible one to the other
[27:09] we don't have to air our dirty laundry
[27:12] but you need to confess privately if you
[27:14] need to confess to somebody or confess
[27:16] with a mediator whichever one you want
[27:18] to do but we need to get if we need to
[27:19] get things out of the way we're not
[27:20] going to move to the church without
[27:21] getting things out of the way amen
[27:24] so the baptism of my holy ghost is what
[27:26] seeing you have purified your souls
[27:29] and obeying the truth as we were talking
[27:32] about this morning obeying the truth
[27:34] what through the spirit you cannot have
[27:36] the truth without having the spirit of
[27:37] god
[27:40] pilate said what is truth
[27:43] well truth was standing in front of him
[27:45] but he rejected him
[27:47] right
[27:48] so what is true truth is the man that
[27:50] was standing in front of truth is the
[27:51] son of man ministry in the end time to
[27:54] me that is the truth
[27:56] being born again not of corruptible seed
[27:57] but of incorruptible seed i'm just
[27:59] background just for a minute because i
[28:00] need to get through over to where i want
[28:02] to go
[28:03] now we know we're predestinated do you
[28:05] really believe that you're
[28:06] pre-destinated
[28:07] i mean you've got to really believe that
[28:08] god puts you in this hour for a reason
[28:11] either to what manifest the devil or to
[28:13] manifest god
[28:15] no twainers
[28:17] remember the man sitting on the fence
[28:19] the devil walks up and says hey buddy
[28:20] what are you doing he said well i'm on
[28:21] the fence i don't know if i want to you
[28:23] know go over here on in in in god's
[28:25] eating or or you know or satan's eating
[28:28] satan said that's fine so that's okay
[28:29] you can stay sitting there all you want
[28:31] to he said i own that fence
[28:39] i don't like fence sitters
[28:41] god don't like fence sitters
[28:43] because you know what you can fall over
[28:45] to one side
[28:47] but if you're far away from that fence
[28:48] you're always going if you fall you're
[28:50] still on god's ground
[28:52] if you fall off of a fence you might
[28:54] fall over on the devil's side but if
[28:55] you'll get far enough away from that
[28:56] fence i don't know why people want to
[28:58] play around the edge of the message i
[29:00] don't know why people want to play
[29:01] around the edge of
[29:03] christianity
[29:05] come to church when you want to
[29:11] yeah and guess what you're gonna walk in
[29:12] this church one day and ain't gonna be
[29:13] nobody here
[29:16] and that little voice is gonna say
[29:19] i told you
[29:21] and you never paid any attention
[29:23] i'm sorry that's the bible
[29:26] like i said this morning that's not my
[29:27] idea that's the bible the bible tells us
[29:31] and the prophet of god never in his life
[29:33] ever said sit at home
[29:37] he said if you've got the holy ghost you
[29:38] can't wait for them to how many of you
[29:40] cannot i can't wait till we get to
[29:42] wednesday service
[29:44] i'd like to have service every night i
[29:45] said when i tell y'all last night i said
[29:47] last night i would love if i could
[29:48] afford it to quit my job and just for
[29:51] seven days in a row just teach this
[29:53] message
[29:54] but not feasible because
[29:57] air conditioner's still got to run
[29:59] we need gas in the car
[30:02] and it's called life but you know what
[30:03] god will make a way what we can do
[30:05] because some of the
[30:07] people that asked about doing a series
[30:10] on message 101 just kind of drop down
[30:12] and why we have a message and why we
[30:14] believe that god sent a prophet
[30:16] and it's not just what we believe we
[30:18] need to do it in scripture
[30:20] because it's all scriptural it's not so
[30:21] i don't i don't
[30:23] well i do i understand this because it's
[30:24] the devil the devil can't stand it
[30:27] so he puts all these things in there
[30:28] well he was wrong here and he was this
[30:30] that he was this scent the other i
[30:31] really don't care he took me to god
[30:34] and listen he made it more simple for me
[30:37] to have faith because you go talk to
[30:39] somebody out in the world and you ask
[30:41] them
[30:42] what's going to happen in the next five
[30:45] years
[30:46] you ask 10 people you'll get 11 answers
[30:51] kind of like they said about beekeepers
[30:52] if you take put 10 beekeepers in a room
[30:54] and ask them one question you're going
[30:56] to get 11 answers
[30:58] because there's opinions
[31:00] the baptist said shake hands and
[31:03] the mess of the said will sprinkle you
[31:06] the presbyterian said well if you get
[31:08] caught in the liquor store that's okay
[31:12] you know baptist won't talk to you
[31:14] in the liquor store
[31:15] but
[31:17] but
[31:20] but do you see what i'm saying though
[31:22] they're not built on a foundation
[31:24] you and i know not to be caught in the
[31:26] liquor store
[31:28] hello
[31:30] we know that god had to send a prophet
[31:33] because of all this
[31:34] stuff that's going on in the world that
[31:36] the baptist says they're right and the
[31:38] method says they're right
[31:40] and the pentecostal said it's shouting
[31:41] and speaking in tongues and if you don't
[31:43] you ain't got it that's wrong but they
[31:46] build their faith on that
[31:48] but it's a false faith
[31:51] it's false there's no there's no
[31:53] foundation sure they had it at one time
[31:55] but when god got ready to build the
[31:57] building guess what happened
[31:59] they said nope this is it
[32:00] we like it right here
[32:03] the baptist said now once they always
[32:05] say we like you know
[32:07] we like it right here
[32:08] as long as saint susie you know made a
[32:10] profession one time
[32:13] 12 years later she passes away or 20
[32:15] years later she's a good member of the
[32:17] church well she hadn't come to church in
[32:18] 20 years
[32:20] but we know the truth
[32:23] we have been taught
[32:24] and you know what it has ever been in
[32:26] here
[32:29] and every bit was in this book brother
[32:31] brown never changed this book
[32:34] he made it to where we could read it
[32:36] with confidence that we can open that
[32:38] book and know exactly what god said know
[32:41] exactly what justification is
[32:44] sanctification is the baptism of the
[32:45] holy ghost having faith going in a
[32:48] rapture not going through the
[32:49] tribulation hello somebody that ought to
[32:51] make you happy that we sitting here
[32:53] we've got the
[32:54] truth pilate what is truth this message
[32:57] of the hour
[32:59] this is truth and it's got to come
[33:01] through me and you it's got to come
[33:02] through a group of people
[33:06] that's why it's in the days of the voice
[33:08] of the seventh angel
[33:11] where's he sounding now he's sounding
[33:12] inside of me and you
[33:14] that voice is the voice of god
[33:17] to this generation
[33:19] and him also you trusted what after you
[33:21] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[33:22] your salvation whom also after that you
[33:24] believed
[33:26] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[33:27] promise which is the earnest of our
[33:29] inheritance until the redemption of the
[33:31] what purchased possession
[33:33] unto the praise of his glory then
[33:35] remember this morning we said god sent
[33:38] us a comforter
[33:39] not a reviler not someone with fear
[33:43] listen you ought to come into this
[33:45] church and be the most comfortable
[33:46] people
[33:48] listen to me in the
[33:50] world people go to venues now look what
[33:53] happened july the 4th in illinois
[33:56] in the middle of a parade
[33:58] this guy just opens fire
[34:00] he dresses up like a woman so he can't
[34:02] so you don't know who he is then he runs
[34:04] through the crowd and acts like somebody
[34:06] that's running away and he's got an
[34:08] ak-47 and he's what wounds 30 kills six
[34:13] i parade
[34:18] well i'm just going to say it
[34:20] i can understand shooting in bars
[34:24] happens all the time
[34:25] but i can't understand somebody in a in
[34:27] a fourth of july parade with kids there
[34:30] and god bless that little child
[34:32] i listen i'm still a human being
[34:35] but remember they found this little
[34:36] child that for a couple hours they kept
[34:38] watching this kid go back and forth and
[34:40] running through here and running here
[34:41] looking over here
[34:43] both of his parents had been killed
[34:46] right at the outset the first couple
[34:48] ones that were killed so they're laying
[34:49] dead in the street and the little boy is
[34:51] continuing going they think it's
[34:52] fireworks so he continues on through the
[34:54] crowd
[34:55] then ever you know all hell breaks loose
[34:57] chaos so the little boy's looking for
[34:59] his mom and daddy and they're both
[35:00] laying in the bushes passed away
[35:02] what a cruel cruel animal satan is
[35:05] amen
[35:07] i'm ready to conquer this place
[35:09] hey man i'm ready for something to come
[35:11] up
[35:12] and it's got to come up inside of you it
[35:14] can't come up in them they're out there
[35:16] running around going what i don't know
[35:19] maybe he was maybe he wasn't whipped
[35:21] when he was a kid maybe he was bullied
[35:22] when he was a kid like mom was talking
[35:24] about we were talking about the guy that
[35:26] shot all those kids
[35:28] in the class he went to the very
[35:31] classroom that he had problems with when
[35:32] he was a little kid somebody had done
[35:34] something to him and and they've traced
[35:36] it back to that
[35:39] and like i said this
[35:41] yesterday i said look
[35:43] video games you can let your kids play
[35:45] them if you want to
[35:47] but that is what is the inlet to your
[35:50] soul your eyes
[35:52] and they're sitting there playing in
[35:53] video games with the ak-47s and they're
[35:56] powerful they're killing people blood
[35:57] splattering everywhere and you know what
[35:59] they just hit reset and start over again
[36:01] well in your mind you can take a real
[36:03] ak-47 go
[36:04] and just hit reset and start over again
[36:07] see what the devil's doing
[36:08] but we've been sent a comforter thank
[36:10] god even in this vile world that we live
[36:13] in we've been sent a comforter look read
[36:16] your bible which is the holy ghost and
[36:18] the father will send in my name
[36:21] he shall teach you all things
[36:24] and bring all things to your remembrance
[36:26] whatsoever i have said
[36:29] unto you we were talking about the three
[36:30] and a half years of jesus's ministry
[36:33] and
[36:34] last night and that's all we got to work
[36:36] off of
[36:37] jesus preached three and a half years
[36:39] we've been preaching for over two
[36:40] thousand years on a three and a half
[36:42] year
[36:43] ministry
[36:45] how eternal is that
[36:47] that we've preached millions of sermons
[36:49] since since 80 30. oh for just three and
[36:53] a half years of one man god almighty and
[36:55] human flesh the son of man well guess
[36:57] what we're under that same ministry now
[37:00] a good short quick work is what god's
[37:02] gonna do in this place
[37:04] all right
[37:06] but you shall receive power after
[37:09] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[37:11] and you shall be witnesses
[37:13] unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria
[37:15] utter most parts of the earth we know
[37:17] that word is called dunamis which is
[37:20] strength or power and i like this one
[37:22] right here power for
[37:23] performing miracles and moral power
[37:28] moral power
[37:29] if the whole world would get the holy
[37:31] ghost we could do away with what we
[37:33] could do away with the police department
[37:36] everybody
[37:37] baptized with well guess what that's
[37:39] what we're going to live under
[37:41] when we get in the new city everybody's
[37:44] going to be born again everybody no
[37:46] malice no gown no hate
[37:50] listen we can't even fathom that
[37:53] because it so bombards us we'll get up
[37:56] in the morning i'll guarantee you we'll
[37:57] read in the paper or we'll look on the
[37:59] news and something awful is going to
[38:01] happen this afternoon so we're just used
[38:03] to that it's just bombarded but what
[38:05] about a day
[38:09] what about a day
[38:12] there's coming a day
[38:15] when no heartache shall come
[38:18] no more clouds
[38:20] in the sky
[38:22] no more tears to dim the eye
[38:25] all is what peace
[38:27] comforter
[38:29] peace
[38:30] forevermore on that happy golden shore
[38:33] you know what it's not it's not a
[38:36] fairytale story
[38:39] brother branham made it so real
[38:41] until you ought to be able to see your
[38:43] city now
[38:44] you ought to be able to see you're part
[38:45] of that city
[38:46] streets of gold you're not going to have
[38:48] to
[38:49] i'm going there you're not going to be
[38:51] where you got to hide something
[38:55] the bible says transparent gold
[38:58] so you can't hide your liquor bottles
[39:00] and you dope
[39:02] in glory
[39:04] won't be none
[39:05] because it'll be transparent gold you
[39:07] know brother john will walk by and
[39:08] sister alicia and they'll go hey brother
[39:10] sister junior we're sitting inside you
[39:12] know we're we're reading a message hey
[39:14] brother sister junior we're sitting
[39:15] inside you know we're we're reading a
[39:17] message book oh they gonna do away with
[39:18] a message and and no i don't think so
[39:22] how y'all doing good how are y'all
[39:25] ain't no bathroom so we don't gotta
[39:26] worry about now that
[39:29] y'all don't think like i do but i think
[39:31] man but to me that wells up something
[39:33] inside that that's what you've got
[39:34] already
[39:36] we gotta start letting that thing out
[39:39] start living what's inside of you i
[39:41] don't care whether it's good or bad
[39:43] if it's bad at least you'll realize it's
[39:45] bad
[39:46] and there's something you can do about
[39:48] it but if you try to think it's good
[39:50] we were talking last night you remember
[39:53] when the prophet of god went to pray for
[39:55] that woman that had been a sunday school
[39:57] teacher
[39:58] and she was dying
[40:00] remember
[40:02] and she said go get my pastor the pastor
[40:04] was there and she said you're a deceiver
[40:06] brother ryan said her real soul
[40:09] her real self
[40:11] raised up and said you deceive her
[40:13] you've told me wrong remember what the
[40:14] old preacher was doing give her a hypo
[40:16] well you know what a hypo is give her a
[40:18] needle give her a shot
[40:19] knock her out
[40:21] knock her out so she won't testify
[40:23] against me
[40:24] well there's no way enough that's going
[40:26] to knock him out her out
[40:28] to say you're a deceiver
[40:30] you deceived me all my life
[40:33] i don't listen you better hope you're
[40:35] not under a ministry like that because
[40:38] the baptist is that way the method is
[40:40] that way all denominations and some
[40:42] people in the message
[40:44] that think that they just call brother
[40:46] brown's name and
[40:48] god shows up
[40:50] no that ain't happening
[40:53] moral power
[40:55] and excellence
[40:56] of soul
[40:59] is it is it well
[41:01] with your soul it's not going to be well
[41:02] with your spirit for a while we're
[41:04] trying we're getting there we're going
[41:06] up the statue of perfect man
[41:07] but it better be you better have it
[41:09] settled in your soul
[41:11] that you got what you the goods
[41:13] as brother tom falbush would say you got
[41:15] the goods i'm not going to get there
[41:17] hold on he told us the evidence now this
[41:19] is the evidence of the holy ghost
[41:21] the evidence of the holy ghost is that
[41:23] we would have the teacher come and teach
[41:25] all truth but that teacher was an inside
[41:27] teacher not an outside teacher
[41:31] now when an ins with the teacher was the
[41:33] one that writes the bible tell you
[41:35] something different than what the bible
[41:36] says
[41:37] but that's what the denominations are
[41:39] building their
[41:41] churches on you can cut your hair
[41:43] you don't have to worry about not
[41:44] wearing pants
[41:46] you can come to church when you want to
[41:49] some of y'all still believe that
[41:52] but you know what you ain't gonna answer
[41:53] to me you know what you're gonna answer
[41:54] to god

[44:05] i'm listen i'm not this is not my
[44:07] opinion this i'm trying to get us to go
[44:10] up that statue of perfect man but if our
[44:11] foundation is not right
[44:14] you can forget it
[44:16] like i said this morning don't worry
[44:17] about the seals don't worry about daniel
[44:19] seven of weeds don't worry about we're
[44:20] eating in the millennium don't worry
[44:22] about where we're going
[44:24] when there are 1260 days are happening
[44:26] down here get born again
[44:29] come to church read your bible
[44:34] if you'll do that first
[44:36] that teacher
[44:38] is promised
[44:39] to take you up that statue of perfect
[44:41] man
[44:42] but you got to get the divine nature of
[44:44] god first
[44:46] first let's what brother brown said what
[44:48] have faith and be born again
[44:50] not faith and know the opening of the
[44:52] seals
[44:54] if this is hitting you right between the
[44:56] eyes you need it
[44:58] you'll never say you didn't tell me
[45:01] brother dale's been screaming it for 45
[45:02] years and i told him last night i said
[45:04] you know what brother branham preached
[45:06] so hard against denominations right
[45:09] he didn't destroy one of them
[45:12] not one said oh we'll just quit and go
[45:14] to start go to the tabernacle
[45:17] not one
[45:18] what brother brown in 1965 he said you
[45:20] pentecostals you get worse every year he
[45:22] was going to life tabernacle
[45:24] where he could preach very open he
[45:26] preached a lot of good sermons at life
[45:28] tabernacle because jack morris said
[45:30] preach what you want to preach but he
[45:31] said y'all get worse every year so for
[45:34] profit bringing the word of god bringing
[45:36] signs and wonders on the platform can't
[45:38] change you i sure can't
[45:41] god's going to have to change you
[45:45] and you're going to decide by your
[45:46] confession or your possession
[45:49] in just a minute if we ever get to it
[45:52] look those who were filled with the holy
[45:53] ghost heard the word received it and
[45:54] what live by it
[45:56] have i not told you anything outside the
[45:58] word of god i've not told you an opinion
[46:03] what's in the word of god so you know
[46:04] what you're not going to be judged by me
[46:05] you're going to be judged by this
[46:07] amen
[46:12] ruth can you sing excuses again excuse
[46:14] me
[46:16] we were talking about something
[46:16] downstairs and she started singing that
[46:18] song excuses excuses that's all i know
[46:20] she knows the rest of it
[46:22] for some reason
[46:23] those who
[46:26] do keep you awake those who did not have
[46:30] the spirit heard it only as carnal men
[46:33] put a wrong interpretation on it and
[46:36] went into sin
[46:38] didn't continue on as christians
[46:41] the prophet said if you turn the message
[46:42] of the hour down whatever message that
[46:44] was you go off into sin
[46:47] in every age is the age of the holy
[46:49] ghost for the true believer i see in
[46:50] every age the evidence was the same
[46:53] those who had the spirit the teacher
[46:55] heard the word and that spirit in them
[46:58] took the word and taught it or revealed
[47:00] it to them and they were of that group
[47:03] that what heard the messenger oh we love
[47:06] that god sent us a prophet right
[47:08] we do i'm not trying to be sarcastic we
[47:10] love that god sent us a prophet
[47:12] but are we doing what he said
[47:16] and his message and took it and
[47:19] sometimes lived it it's not what he said
[47:22] and lived it
[47:24] and what is the message of the hour the
[47:26] bible being revealed
[47:29] not your idea and my idea
[47:33] matthew 11 verse 12 says and from the
[47:34] days of john the baptist until now the
[47:36] kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and
[47:38] the violence
[47:40] take it by force
[47:42] this is not
[47:43] going to be spoons forks and knives
[47:47] it's swords
[47:49] it's a battle
[47:51] it's a battle to get up in the morning
[47:53] it's a battle it's about hey it's a
[47:54] battle go to work
[47:57] and then much less
[47:58] coming to church
[48:00] ii peter 1 verse 5 says simon peter
[48:02] servant apostle jesus christ what to
[48:04] them he's talking to a group of people
[48:07] to them that have obtained
[48:09] like precious faith
[48:11] what like them
[48:13] like peter y'all believe peter had the
[48:15] holy ghost listen it was written in the
[48:18] bible that peter got the holy ghost
[48:20] right on the day of pentecost 120 in the
[48:23] upper rim so he's got it
[48:25] so he's got this precious faith and he's
[48:27] telling us that we have obtained that
[48:29] same like precious faith
[48:32] with us through the righteousness of god
[48:34] and our savior jesus christ and i kind
[48:36] of stopped right there because i want to
[48:38] um
[48:39] interject this right here but i say unto
[48:40] you that every idle word this is where
[48:42] was that this morning
[48:43] that men shall speak they shall give an
[48:45] account thereof on the day of judgment
[48:47] for by thy words thou shalt be justified
[48:50] and by thy words
[48:52] thou shalt be condemned
[48:54] i'm just reading you the bible
[48:55] look romans 10 verse 9 that thou shalt
[48:57] what confess with thy mouth
[49:00] the lord jesus and believe in your heart
[49:02] so there's two things
[49:04] believing and confession
[49:06] that god hath raised him from the dead
[49:08] thou shalt be saved for with the heart
[49:09] man believeth unto righteousness and
[49:11] with the mouth confession is made unto
[49:14] salvation now that word confessed in the
[49:16] greek i kind of condensed it a little
[49:18] bit and
[49:19] it made it a little bigger so you can
[49:20] see what it says confess is what
[49:22] freedom would you do today
[49:25] you admitted guilt
[49:27] read it you admitted
[49:29] yourself
[49:30] i can't i can't confess
[49:33] susan's guilt
[49:37] no way i don't know what it is
[49:39] but i sure know mine
[49:42] hello somebody i know mine
[49:45] i know where my faults are i know the
[49:47] thoughts i've had of all y'all
[49:52] to admit i'm just kidding i love
[49:54] everybody i love every one of you i
[49:56] think we got the greatest group when bob
[49:58] was talking about it luis is back here
[49:59] in the back they go off to different
[50:01] places and they look and see we think we
[50:03] got problems
[50:05] we good
[50:07] right we good
[50:09] we're all right
[50:10] confess because you know what it comes
[50:13] down to the word of god it's not your
[50:14] feelings or my feelings or whether i
[50:16] like brother dale or whether you like
[50:17] brother whether you like me or don't
[50:18] like me that doesn't matter
[50:20] the word of god is always true
[50:22] it will always what you go back to is go
[50:25] back to the word of god don't go back to
[50:26] a feeling don't go back to an emotion go
[50:29] back to the word of god say what does it
[50:31] say right here
[50:33] what does it say right here
[50:36] because remember god can't change his
[50:38] mind about his word if he loved you to
[50:40] begin with and you you would love him
[50:43] when you got here
[50:44] he never did not love you
[50:47] it's an eternal thought of god
[50:50] to admit
[50:51] or declare one's self-guilt
[50:54] of what one is accused of
[50:58] freedom
[50:59] you accused yourself because you know
[51:01] what you did
[51:02] i'm just you know you don't mind
[51:04] i use freda because she won't fall over
[51:06] some of y'all be going
[51:10] i know you knew we were talking yeah so
[51:12] do i know you're pretty good
[51:14] you know we were talking about being 14
[51:15] years old
[51:17] she was my girlfriend at 14 years old
[51:20] 13 or 14. so anyway so we've known each
[51:23] other a long time but she i know i know
[51:25] kind of how she thinks that's kind of
[51:26] weird but um
[51:28] but like today i knew where she was
[51:30] coming from she wanted to get something
[51:32] out that was what there was there was
[51:34] you ever get that old feeling you they
[51:35] say stuck in your craw
[51:38] what your crawls your throat
[51:40] you get something stuck in your crawl
[51:41] what it won't come out
[51:43] and you know what it's going to do is
[51:44] choke you
[51:45] it's going to choke your christian life
[51:47] if you don't get rid of some of the
[51:48] stuff that you're doing me included
[51:51] that's that we're doing confess
[51:53] like i said before
[51:56] i said something about a brother
[51:58] and that stuck in my craw
[52:01] listen if a prophet of god
[52:05] come on somebody
[52:06] and you know where i'm going most of you
[52:07] do if a prophet of god
[52:09] going to lay hands now this is brother
[52:11] branham now
[52:13] oh i support reverend brother william
[52:15] branham the prophet of the end times
[52:17] everybody with me
[52:18] a man seventh church aged messenger
[52:22] teaching us perfection
[52:26] he goes to lay hands on a baby
[52:29] and god said stop right there
[52:35] i mean he's like and god said don't put
[52:37] what he say don't put your dirty hands
[52:40] on that child
[52:42] and brother branham
[52:44] instantly in his mind
[52:46] he knew what he'd done
[52:48] it was in there like i said frida didn't
[52:50] know what i'd done i didn't know what
[52:51] she done but it was in her mind what she
[52:52] did
[52:53] it was in brother brown's mind that what
[52:55] he done is he told a little white lie oh
[52:58] come on somebody
[53:00] he told a little white lion it wasn't
[53:02] really a lie he wasn't in the house he
[53:03] stepped outside of the house
[53:07] but
[53:09] he was there
[53:11] and they he had to go back what'd he do
[53:13] he said hold on a minute
[53:15] now what about a prophet coming into a
[53:17] home
[53:17] and you're you're you're trusting that
[53:19] he's gonna pray for your baby and it's
[53:21] gonna get well because he's the prophet
[53:24] he knows everything
[53:25] and he gets ready to do this and you
[53:27] know i mean it wasn't probably a booming
[53:28] voice god spoke to him in this in his
[53:30] heart and said
[53:31] don't put your hands on dirty hands on
[53:33] that baby
[53:34] so brother brown had to look at that
[53:36] mother and father and say hey hold on a
[53:37] minute i got to go make something right
[53:39] now what he had to do he didn't go
[53:40] outside and call on cell phones there
[53:42] wasn't any back then he had to get in
[53:44] his car and find that irs agent
[53:48] and apologize
[53:50] for lying
[53:51] what did he do he confessed
[53:54] but when he confessed that put him in a
[53:56] state of profession to a possession
[53:59] where he could come back and he said as
[54:00] soon as he laid his hands on the baby
[54:02] the baby got better now that's how god
[54:04] works folks i'm telling you that's why
[54:06] somebody quoted it the other day that
[54:08] that one unconfessed sin in this
[54:10] congregation
[54:11] one
[54:13] can make us bitterly fail
[54:15] it can stop
[54:16] the program of god one thing
[54:21] do we walk through that door
[54:24] and say god
[54:26] whatever it is
[54:27] number one
[54:28] bring it to my attention
[54:30] and number two give me time to get it
[54:32] right
[54:33] because see we're fixing to take
[54:34] communion and the bible says in the
[54:36] communion that if you have all in other
[54:37] words if there's something going on in
[54:39] your life and you partake of communion
[54:41] and you take of it wrong
[54:44] many are sick and weakly among you and
[54:47] many are dead
[54:49] may i quote the scripture many are
[54:50] asleep
[54:52] because
[54:54] we put so much on we put so much on
[54:56] taking communion
[54:58] but if you take it wrong it's killing
[54:59] you
[55:01] me and everybody
[55:04] but see this is the time of cleaning up
[55:06] getting everything out that's why i
[55:08] i talked to a brother one time and he
[55:10] said well we only take communion when
[55:12] we're ready i said well we would never
[55:13] take it
[55:18] this makes us get ready
[55:21] we know we gonna take it on the first of
[55:23] every month or the first sunday and the
[55:25] second one if we have visitors
[55:27] like we are today
[55:30] but it's that time where it just kind of
[55:32] rechecks us
[55:34] makes us confess
[55:36] makes us get right with god
[55:38] makes us try to do the right things
[55:41] come on people
[55:46] this ain't fooling around
[55:49] i knew listen when i was coming to this
[55:51] church as a young boy
[55:54] i knew not to take that communion
[55:55] because i wasn't a christian
[55:58] even though i may wanted to and my
[56:00] friend did and this one over here did i
[56:02] didn't take it
[56:04] because i knew if i did i was eating and
[56:06] drinking damnation
[56:08] to myself
[56:11] now folks if we let satan run around in
[56:13] our heads so much we'd never take it but
[56:16] when you confess
[56:18] it felt good that they didn't freedom
[56:20] felt good to get that out
[56:22] i felt good when i called that brother
[56:24] and said look brother i've said some bad
[56:25] things about you and i want to apologize
[56:26] he's all brother don't worry you're
[56:27] forgiven already
[56:29] but you know what that was for me it
[56:30] didn't matter i knew he would forgive me
[56:32] but that was for me to get that load off
[56:35] and then you know what i can move on
[56:37] with god i want to move on with god
[56:41] that's that pull i was talking about
[56:42] this morning you we talking about third
[56:44] pull that's the pull the pull is pulling
[56:46] us up that statue of a perfect man
[56:49] not a third pull when
[56:51] brother brown's got to come back and
[56:52] shoot a bear and and like chris was
[56:54] talking about you know put up a tent
[56:56] good grief come on we ought to be way
[56:59] beyond that
[57:03] brother brown said rapture and faith
[57:04] lies in the books and tapes
[57:06] i'll take what he said over your opinion
[57:08] any day of the week all right see he's
[57:11] gonna sick among you let him call for
[57:12] the elders of the church and let him
[57:13] pray over him
[57:14] anointing him with oil in the name of
[57:16] the lord
[57:17] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[57:18] sick watch this and the lord shall what
[57:20] raise him up and if he have committed
[57:22] sins they shall be forgiven do you know
[57:23] if you come here
[57:25] and you pray get prayed for anointed
[57:27] with oil in the name of the lord the
[57:29] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[57:31] the lord shall raise him up and if he
[57:33] has commanded sins they'll be forgiven
[57:34] him
[57:36] confess your faults one to another
[57:39] pray one for another that you may be
[57:41] healed
[57:43] the official fervent prayer
[57:46] of a righteous man
[57:48] availeth
[57:49] a little
[57:52] it said much
[57:54] now let's look at this word possess
[57:57] the word possess means to acquire
[57:59] to get
[58:01] procure a thing for what one's self
[58:04] it's my possession when june is my
[58:05] possession i married her i take her i
[58:07] took her as my possession amen that's
[58:09] what it says
[58:11] to marry a wife
[58:14] and that's what god's done he's took a
[58:15] bride
[58:17] amen
[58:18] first thessalonians four verse four said
[58:20] that every one of you
[58:25] watch
[58:25] every one of you
[58:27] i like what paul says
[58:29] every one of you not certain parts of
[58:31] you
[58:32] every one of you should know how to
[58:34] possess his vessel
[58:36] in sanctification and honor and i want
[58:38] you to hold that scripture because we're
[58:39] going to use it three or four thousand
[58:40] more times
[58:42] that is telling you about going up the
[58:44] statue of a perfect man
[58:49] that's not sanctification that the
[58:50] unclean spirit goes out and
[58:52] at baby form sanctification this is a
[58:54] daily sanctification
[58:56] you should know how to possess what
[59:00] knowledge
[59:02] not knowledge that you can do algebra
[59:06] no knowledge that what god says right
[59:11] possess his vessel
[59:13] in sanctification
[59:15] and honor
[59:17] manifestation of the spirit 1951
[59:21] now you come to the altar realizing
[59:23] you're a sinner and you're sorry for
[59:24] your sins you repent of what you've done
[59:27] if you can stay there and cry for a week
[59:28] in and out and you can stay there and
[59:30] cry for a week in and out and it would
[59:33] never save you until you believe in your
[59:34] heart
[59:36] that you are saved is that right then
[59:38] you confess it
[59:41] now he can't do nothing for you until
[59:43] you confess it
[59:45] is that right for he is the high priest
[59:47] of what your confession
[59:50] he can do nothing you confess me before
[59:52] men i'll confess you before the father
[59:54] is that right what you say i've done
[59:57] down here for you that's what i say the
[59:58] father in other words he said father
[1:00:00] they did this down here i'm standing for
[1:00:02] them i'm standing for them now they
[1:00:04] stood for me down here that's what he's
[1:00:05] saying
[1:00:06] you get that young man he's talking to
[1:00:08] somebody
[1:00:09] the high priest of your confession now
[1:00:12] here is he's sitting here well to make
[1:00:14] intercession on my confession and i have
[1:00:17] a right to confess that he's done
[1:00:20] anything for me that's in the redemptive
[1:00:22] blessing there you are what was the
[1:00:24] redemptive blessing he was wounded for
[1:00:26] our transgression bruised for our
[1:00:28] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:00:29] was upon him and with his stripes we
[1:00:31] were healed is that right
[1:00:34] that's every believer's possession
[1:00:37] that's mine
[1:00:39] that's mine
[1:00:42] the 70th week of daniel we were talking
[1:00:43] about this last night but not this this
[1:00:45] quote but we were talking about the 70th
[1:00:47] week of daniel there is such a thing as
[1:00:49] the 70th week of daniel
[1:00:51] not half a week all right
[1:00:53] i said all i'll imagine when it shifted
[1:00:56] down that doesn't even do it justice
[1:00:58] brother branham before this i cut it
[1:01:00] short brother brown there was somebody
[1:01:01] came to him and said brother brown said
[1:01:02] the way you're talking there's not
[1:01:03] anybody gonna make it
[1:01:05] all right when you get the real pure in
[1:01:08] heart born again of the spirit remember
[1:01:09] this was the only church age that christ
[1:01:11] was put out of his own church
[1:01:13] of all of them we got a great confession
[1:01:16] but do we have a possession is what
[1:01:18] we're talking about
[1:01:20] is christ really in the church it'll be
[1:01:23] very much in the minority
[1:01:27] so do i brother
[1:01:28] see it more and more
[1:01:31] and with just a few gonna make it
[1:01:33] fear not little flock but you know what
[1:01:36] i'm one of them you guys say you're one
[1:01:38] of them i confess i'm one of them
[1:01:42] okay sarah just went
[1:01:47] that's good that to me that says a
[1:01:49] million words
[1:01:51] she went
[1:01:53] right here
[1:01:56] thank you sarah
[1:01:58] that was perfect
[1:02:01] i was watching them
[1:02:03] somebody the other day and they'd just
[1:02:04] done a funeral and the brother joel
[1:02:06] brown's mother i think passed away
[1:02:09] and
[1:02:10] they said right before she died
[1:02:12] this is right before she died
[1:02:14] since she raised up in a bed and said
[1:02:17] wow
[1:02:20] wow
[1:02:23] that's enough for me
[1:02:26] because some of them will probably set
[1:02:28] up in the bed and go oh no
[1:02:31] no no no no no but she said they said
[1:02:33] she looked up in the sky and said
[1:02:35] wow
[1:02:37] she was entering into another dimension
[1:02:40] and it was so happy all cause she could
[1:02:42] say was wow
[1:02:45] that's a sermon in itself
[1:02:47] stand up and just say wow
[1:02:49] wow
[1:02:50] when something's unfolded to you wow
[1:02:54] simon peter servant the apostle of jesus
[1:02:56] christ to them that have obtained a lot
[1:02:57] precious faith with us through the
[1:02:58] righteousness of god to get back on our
[1:03:00] point here and our savior jesus christ
[1:03:02] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:03:04] through the knowledge of god and of
[1:03:06] jesus our lord according to his divine
[1:03:08] power i love that word divine
[1:03:12] hath given unto us
[1:03:15] all things that pertain unto life and
[1:03:17] godliness
[1:03:19] through the knowledge of him that has
[1:03:20] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[1:03:22] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:03:24] precious promises thank god he's heaping
[1:03:26] upon us
[1:03:27] that by these you might be partaker of
[1:03:29] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:03:31] corruption that is in the world through
[1:03:33] lust and besides this giving all
[1:03:34] diligence look add to your faith
[1:03:39] add to your faith
[1:03:42] not god's faith oh brother i'm reading
[1:03:44] the bible
[1:03:46] it says that to your faith i love what
[1:03:48] brother brown said one day he said you
[1:03:50] know what he said this is my eye
[1:03:53] because god gave it to me
[1:03:55] so this is my holy ghost because you
[1:03:57] know what god give it to me
[1:03:59] so this is what you're going to see your
[1:04:01] faith
[1:04:02] in action
[1:04:04] and we're going to talk about just for a
[1:04:06] minute renewing of the mind now faith
[1:04:08] i was i was thinking i thought well i'm
[1:04:10] going to look up
[1:04:11] a good definition for faith
[1:04:14] why in the world would i want to look up
[1:04:15] a good definition for faith when it's
[1:04:16] right here in front of our face
[1:04:19] why would i want to know what daniel
[1:04:20] webster said
[1:04:22] about
[1:04:23] faith
[1:04:24] the bible says
[1:04:26] now faith is the substance of things
[1:04:28] hoped for
[1:04:29] the evidence of things not seen that's a
[1:04:32] good enough definition for me
[1:04:34] for by the elders obtained a good report
[1:04:36] through faith we understand that the
[1:04:37] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[1:04:39] the things which are seen were not made
[1:04:41] of things which do appear in other words
[1:04:43] we go and we we take and create a car we
[1:04:46] create a car because we what we get
[1:04:48] metal
[1:04:49] plastic
[1:04:51] rubber
[1:04:53] gears
[1:04:54] that's already here
[1:04:56] and we make it with it
[1:04:59] god took it from nothing
[1:05:02] and made he knows every star by name
[1:05:05] he knows the day he created it
[1:05:08] and it's been billions and billions of
[1:05:10] years ago he knows exactly where he put
[1:05:11] them
[1:05:13] he knew exactly where to put the moon
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] you know that moon's the top of me and
[1:05:19] you
[1:05:20] do you know what happened in the fall or
[1:05:22] not in the fall but in during the flood
[1:05:24] remember the world was standing straight
[1:05:26] up
[1:05:27] now it's what 20 degrees or 18 degrees
[1:05:29] or how many degrees it wobbles that's
[1:05:32] why we got our spring summer fall and
[1:05:33] winter
[1:05:35] history lesson here or a
[1:05:37] science lesson here
[1:05:39] but what kept that thing from tilting on
[1:05:42] over
[1:05:43] what kept that world from going into
[1:05:45] chaos
[1:05:48] god had already put a moon right there
[1:05:51] and when that moon went around the earth
[1:05:53] it pulls it this way
[1:05:56] oh praise god
[1:05:58] when it goes over here
[1:06:00] it pulls it out of its chaos this way
[1:06:02] and it keeps it in orbit
[1:06:06] all the water in the ocean move about 20
[1:06:08] feet one way
[1:06:10] and then when she goes around the back
[1:06:12] side
[1:06:14] goes back this way
[1:06:15] what is a moon on top of the bride
[1:06:19] without us on this earth this earth
[1:06:21] would fall apart it would tilt so far
[1:06:24] over to one side it would destroy this
[1:06:26] place but thank god he put a moon
[1:06:30] and the bible tells us in the end time
[1:06:31] that the moon is going to be as bright
[1:06:33] as the sun
[1:06:35] seven times
[1:06:36] through seven church ages he's put a
[1:06:38] bride here to keep this world standing
[1:06:40] straight up if not this world's gonna
[1:06:42] look when this thing is over
[1:06:47] and there's no bride on the earth
[1:06:50] we were talking about last night
[1:06:51] total chaos
[1:06:53] no new birth no holy ghost
[1:06:56] no blood
[1:06:58] nothing it's the wrath of god poured out
[1:07:02] on the world
[1:07:03] don't be here
[1:07:06] whatever you got to do
[1:07:08] don't be here young people
[1:07:10] nothing in this world is worth staying
[1:07:12] here for
[1:07:13] nothing
[1:07:19] by faith abel offered unto god
[1:07:22] it just thrills my soul when you can see
[1:07:23] what god did
[1:07:26] for me and you
[1:07:30] he obtained a witness he was righteous
[1:07:32] god testifying of his gift
[1:07:34] and by he being dead yet speaketh
[1:07:36] remember the bible talks about i mean uh
[1:07:38] his blood speaking abel's blood by faith
[1:07:41] enoch was translated that he should not
[1:07:42] see death and was not found because god
[1:07:44] translated him for what before his
[1:07:46] translation he had this testimony that
[1:07:48] he pleased god
[1:07:50] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:07:52] please him
[1:07:53] so that's what i said before it it does
[1:07:56] that like brother brown said you can
[1:07:57] read books right here you can read books
[1:08:00] you can fast
[1:08:01] you can pray
[1:08:04] but without faith
[1:08:06] it's impossible to please
[1:08:08] god now we want to speak today on faith
[1:08:11] number five
[1:08:13] a different kind of faith there's
[1:08:15] different kinds remember we kind of hit
[1:08:16] on that the other sunday
[1:08:18] and we'll talk about it just a little
[1:08:20] bit now faith we're told in the bible
[1:08:21] faith cometh by hearing
[1:08:24] now you cannot be saved without faith
[1:08:27] and faith is something that you have to
[1:08:29] believe it's there
[1:08:32] that really nothing else will declare
[1:08:35] it's there but faith everybody reading
[1:08:38] that
[1:08:39] what an explanation by seventh grade
[1:08:42] kentucky kid
[1:08:46] scholars are going what
[1:08:48] what are you talking about
[1:08:51] now i'm trying to bring faith to you so
[1:08:53] she can be ready for this prayer line in
[1:08:54] the next few minutes now faith he that
[1:08:56] cometh to god must believe that he is
[1:08:58] what that he is god and it's impossible
[1:09:00] to please god without faith you cannot
[1:09:02] please him and if you say you believe
[1:09:04] god you have never seen him see so then
[1:09:08] you've got to
[1:09:09] go to faith
[1:09:10] go to believe it by faith and if you
[1:09:12] could see him it wouldn't be faith no
[1:09:13] more
[1:09:15] if jesus was standing right here
[1:09:17] you wouldn't have to have faith that
[1:09:18] jesus was standing right here
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:22] that's why the bible talks about the end
[1:09:24] of our faith
[1:09:25] there will be an end of our faith when
[1:09:28] we get into the future home we will not
[1:09:30] need faith anymore
[1:09:33] why would we need faith
[1:09:35] all knowing all seeing i'm not talking
[1:09:37] about god i'm talking about you
[1:09:41] travel like a thought
[1:09:43] we won't have to have faith but you know
[1:09:45] what it's the faith foundation that we
[1:09:47] built down here
[1:09:49] down here's where you're building your
[1:09:51] building not up there
[1:09:53] i'm spitting all over the place
[1:09:56] why christ speak
[1:09:58] look
[1:10:00] moses
[1:10:01] go down there i'll be with you
[1:10:03] it anointed the faith that was in him
[1:10:07] and it anoints us when we see that we're
[1:10:10] living in the last days i like what
[1:10:11] brother chris was talking about you know
[1:10:12] brother man preached modern events made
[1:10:14] clear by prophecy but we see prophecy
[1:10:17] made clear by the events that are here
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:20] find out because brother brown was
[1:10:22] prophesying folks we're not see it we're
[1:10:24] in it
[1:10:26] that's what i was telling those
[1:10:27] jamaicans years ago we were talking
[1:10:29] about the the vision that brother brown
[1:10:30] had of of the jamaicans running up the
[1:10:32] mountain
[1:10:34] and taking the gospel
[1:10:36] into jamaica
[1:10:38] well that's wonderful but until that
[1:10:40] happens it's just it's just a dream
[1:10:44] but once they stepped into that dream
[1:10:45] and the people literally started going
[1:10:47] and taking the message through jamaica
[1:10:50] they were fulfilling that prophecy and
[1:10:52] the vision that was seen
[1:10:54] so
[1:10:56] i drew you to step in the vision
[1:10:59] step in the vision of the word of god
[1:11:01] that the prophet of god brought in the
[1:11:02] end time
[1:11:03] that we can take a body change
[1:11:06] it anoints us when we see we're living
[1:11:08] in the last days to find out all these
[1:11:10] signs that we see being taking place now
[1:11:11] this is 19 what i say
[1:11:13] 1963
[1:11:16] that's 60 years ago
[1:11:18] is that right yeah 60 60 years ago we're
[1:11:21] almost in 2023 60 years ago
[1:11:25] if fond of these signs that we see
[1:11:27] taking place that spoke of in the
[1:11:28] scripture would take place in the last
[1:11:29] days all the way from heaven to the
[1:11:31] political powers the nature of the
[1:11:32] people the demoralization of the world
[1:11:35] among the women and how they would do in
[1:11:36] the last days and how the men would do
[1:11:38] well tell me about it and how the
[1:11:40] churches would do he'll leave the
[1:11:42] churches out and how the nations would
[1:11:44] do it how god would do
[1:11:46] and we see it all laying right here on
[1:11:48] us
[1:11:49] oh it anoints our faith it moves us out
[1:11:52] in the great cycle that's what i'm
[1:11:53] talking about folks put your faith in
[1:11:55] this message
[1:11:56] there's none other
[1:11:58] there's none other than this message of
[1:12:00] the hour nothing will take you to a body
[1:12:03] change nothing will take you up the
[1:12:04] statue of perfect man except this
[1:12:06] message of the hour
[1:12:10] it moves us out into great cycles it
[1:12:12] separates us from other things of the
[1:12:14] world
[1:12:16] no matter how little we are or how much
[1:12:19] a minority we are how much we're laughed
[1:12:21] at made fun of don't make a bit of
[1:12:23] difference
[1:12:24] that's all we see it
[1:12:26] there's something within us
[1:12:28] we were predestinated to see this hour
[1:12:32] here god has spoken it's already
[1:12:34] happened we see it and how we thank god
[1:12:36] for this oh then it brings out your
[1:12:38] faith when you see these things
[1:12:40] happening here
[1:12:41] listen to the world it's chaos to us
[1:12:44] it's prophecy
[1:12:47] we know what's going to happen romans 12
[1:12:50] verse 2
[1:12:52] be not conformed to this world but be
[1:12:53] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:12:59] why because everything you do right now
[1:13:00] is contrary
[1:13:04] if you didn't have the new birth you
[1:13:05] wouldn't want to be a church
[1:13:07] you'd want to be somewhere else
[1:13:10] right
[1:13:12] you sisters who put on a pair of pants
[1:13:14] because that's the world that's your old
[1:13:16] thinking
[1:13:17] why do these people leave the message
[1:13:18] most of them that leave the message they
[1:13:20] go right back out in the world it's like
[1:13:21] they do away with the bible while
[1:13:22] they're doing away with brother adam
[1:13:24] the bible's still true
[1:13:27] i don't care who's spoken through a dumb
[1:13:28] donkey
[1:13:30] but you can't go back and start cutting
[1:13:32] your hair wearing
[1:13:33] pants sisters if you turn this message
[1:13:35] down the bible still tells you not to do
[1:13:36] it
[1:13:38] good grief
[1:13:41] but their mind has not been renewed
[1:13:42] their mind is taking them back like some
[1:13:44] of y'all are falling off into sleep now
[1:13:46] and your mind is taking you to nowhere
[1:13:48] to land a nod leg up
[1:13:52] this is more important than your eyes
[1:13:53] being closed
[1:13:57] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:13:58] mind that you may what prove
[1:14:01] we're going to prove
[1:14:04] that god's right
[1:14:05] we're going to prove that william
[1:14:07] branham was the prophet of the end time
[1:14:09] you and i are going to prove it he's
[1:14:10] gone he can't say anything
[1:14:13] you and i are the voice that's going to
[1:14:15] keep this thing going
[1:14:17] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:14:19] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:14:21] i like good positive words i don't like
[1:14:24] negative words
[1:14:25] for i say through the grace given unto
[1:14:27] me to every man that is among you not to
[1:14:29] think of itself more highly than he
[1:14:30] ought to think but to think soberly
[1:14:32] according as god has dealt to every man
[1:14:34] the measure
[1:14:35] of faith what is that measure look a
[1:14:38] renewal that's to talk about your mind a
[1:14:40] renewal a renovation
[1:14:44] that rain

[1:14:48] think we're going to start praying to

[1:15:03] because the grass don't grow if it
[1:15:04] doesn't get rain
[1:15:05] and listen you don't grow if you don't
[1:15:07] get rain

[1:16:27] and let me dump all my trash in it
[1:16:30] well this is your dumpster i've never
[1:16:31] heard anybody call a church a dumpster
[1:16:33] well guess what
[1:16:35] this is where you are what cast your
[1:16:37] cares dump your trash
[1:16:40] freda dumped her trash today
[1:16:43] right here in this building you know
[1:16:44] what that filter will not let it go out
[1:16:46] that door the holy ghost will not let
[1:16:49] that go out because brother collie read
[1:16:51] about not returning void
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:55] but it will accomplish
[1:16:57] what it said
[1:16:59] but i want to ask you a question do you
[1:17:00] believe it well
[1:17:03] you know sister freda would have never
[1:17:05] walked up here if she hadn't believed
[1:17:06] they'd done any good
[1:17:09] hello somebody
[1:17:10] that was faith
[1:17:14] i'm we with you sister we desperate with
[1:17:16] her hey who's not desperate we're all
[1:17:18] desperate with her
[1:17:20] this is a life this is life
[1:17:23] and she's part of us
[1:17:26] but we got a measure of faith all right
[1:17:28] so let's get to that just for a second
[1:17:30] an instrument for measuring a vessel for
[1:17:32] receiving and determining the quantity
[1:17:34] of things like i said before
[1:17:37] how many quarts is it from here to lula
[1:17:41] now wait a minute
[1:17:42] quartz of measurement
[1:17:45] right
[1:17:46] how many quarts is it from here to
[1:17:48] alcohol
[1:17:49] two quarts three quarts
[1:17:52] it's a measurement
[1:17:53] but it's not right
[1:17:56] but now if i say how many miles is it
[1:18:00] we go ah that's right
[1:18:03] but if we want to bake a cake
[1:18:05] how many miles of chocolate do we need
[1:18:07] to use
[1:18:09] to do not enough
[1:18:14] we went on a cruise to alaska one time
[1:18:15] and the only reason i don't think it
[1:18:17] didn't matter what the boat looked like
[1:18:18] she said they've got a chocolate bar
[1:18:22] and it's 24 7.
[1:18:26] i mean she's embarrassing me
[1:18:28] [Laughter]
[1:18:34] but we don't measure miles by chocolate
[1:18:37] so we don't measure we have a measure of
[1:18:39] faith that
[1:18:40] luther had a measure of faith but you
[1:18:42] know what that measure of faith is not
[1:18:44] ours
[1:18:46] luther's measure of faith was the just
[1:18:48] shall live by faith
[1:18:50] he could smoke a pipe drink a beer
[1:18:52] and be he's a german he so he could do
[1:18:54] that all right
[1:18:55] and the
[1:18:57] god said all right live by the just
[1:18:59] shall live by faith i'm going to anoint
[1:19:01] that and that's yours all right
[1:19:04] but now me and you are over here in the
[1:19:06] age of full restoration
[1:19:09] not
[1:19:10] not
[1:19:11] reformation we're in restoration so this
[1:19:14] faith is not done away with it's just
[1:19:16] brought over and what enhanced or made
[1:19:18] more a graduated staff for measure what
[1:19:21] is measuring to do it measures how big
[1:19:24] or how long
[1:19:25] or how high
[1:19:29] the height
[1:19:30] the depth
[1:19:32] the length
[1:19:33] and the breath you can't count it when
[1:19:36] you talk about god's love
[1:19:38] but you have a measure
[1:19:40] of faith brother brown said statue of
[1:19:42] perfect man he says have faith
[1:19:44] and be born again that's laying
[1:19:46] the foundation
[1:19:48] june 1 jude 1 verse 3
[1:19:51] beloved now we're going to talk about a
[1:19:52] measure of faith here beloved when i
[1:19:54] give all diligence to write unto you the
[1:19:56] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:19:58] to write unto you now he's writing unto
[1:20:00] people christians
[1:20:02] and they exhort you that you should
[1:20:03] earnestly contend for the faith which
[1:20:05] was once delivered to the saints so
[1:20:07] somewhere it got lost
[1:20:11] somewhere got lost so there's a lost
[1:20:13] faith
[1:20:16] that's why we had to have the prophet of
[1:20:17] god
[1:20:18] to bring that faith of the fathers
[1:20:23] take us back to that faith of the
[1:20:25] fathers
[1:20:26] so that we can build this pyramid in the
[1:20:28] end time
[1:20:30] amen contend for the faith that was once
[1:20:33] delivered unto the saints it got lost
[1:20:34] down to the church ages like i read to
[1:20:36] you before
[1:20:37] man's ideas got involved
[1:20:40] denominations got involved divisions got
[1:20:43] involved
[1:20:44] god never intended for that
[1:20:46] for there are certain men well that's
[1:20:48] the problem
[1:20:50] i brought i'm not going to read this
[1:20:51] quote but i'm going to paraphrase it for
[1:20:52] you brother brown you know he always
[1:20:54] said his worst enemies were preachers
[1:20:57] and that's what he was telling him he
[1:20:59] said i sit around with a bunch of
[1:21:00] preachers you know what he said let me
[1:21:01] tell you what brother brown said
[1:21:03] if i can find i'd read it real quick but
[1:21:05] brother ryan said i'd rather be sitting
[1:21:06] at a table with witch doctors than to be
[1:21:08] sitting with the preachers i was sitting
[1:21:10] with the other
[1:21:12] day put in witch doctors and you'll see
[1:21:16] that's exactly what he said i'd rather
[1:21:17] be sitting with a table with witch
[1:21:19] doctors than to sit with preachers that
[1:21:21] i sat with the other day
[1:21:24] well that made you quiet good you ought
[1:21:26] to think about that
[1:21:28] that's how bad that spirit is if it's
[1:21:30] not right
[1:21:31] it's an evil witch doctor spirit if it's
[1:21:34] not truth
[1:21:36] but we must earnestly contend for the
[1:21:37] faith which is one delivered to the
[1:21:38] saints guess what that's what brother
[1:21:40] branham brought us back to
[1:21:42] he brought us back to that faith
[1:21:46] now what are you going to do about it
[1:21:48] for there are certain men crept in
[1:21:50] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:21:52] to this condemnation
[1:21:54] ungodly men
[1:21:56] turning the grace of our god into
[1:21:58] lasciviousness
[1:22:00] and denying the only lord god in our
[1:22:02] lord jesus christ so there was a lost
[1:22:04] faith
[1:22:05] then we talked a couple of sundays ago
[1:22:07] about faith for the time that's needed
[1:22:10] the loyal woman that had the blood issue
[1:22:13] she had faith for the time the prophet
[1:22:15] of god said
[1:22:17] remember the
[1:22:18] she had a blood issue that she
[1:22:21] her female trouble that she couldn't
[1:22:22] stop bleeding
[1:22:24] but look at if you'll just you say well
[1:22:26] that's that's
[1:22:28] that's pretty bad but you know what
[1:22:30] she couldn't do nothing
[1:22:32] she couldn't go into her husband because
[1:22:33] she was on her period come on people she
[1:22:35] couldn't go in the congregation
[1:22:37] for 12 years
[1:22:39] she was in bad shape
[1:22:41] everywhere she sat down was unclean
[1:22:45] according to the old testament
[1:22:47] read your bible
[1:22:49] she was unclean everywhere she went
[1:22:52] she was tired of it how many of us are
[1:22:53] tired of being unclean
[1:22:55] that's our problem we carry too much of
[1:22:57] this junk with us
[1:22:59] well i'm gonna preach a little bit today
[1:23:01] if that's okay
[1:23:04] your genuine faith will do it right
[1:23:06] there your genuine faith will make it so
[1:23:09] real to you
[1:23:10] look at that little woman with a blood
[1:23:11] issue she said if i can only touch the
[1:23:13] border of his garment
[1:23:15] i'll be made well
[1:23:16] and as soon as she did it she said she
[1:23:18] felt within herself
[1:23:20] that her blood issue
[1:23:22] had stopped
[1:23:24] she actually
[1:23:25] believed it
[1:23:28] she actually jumped up and down no she
[1:23:30] actually she believed it
[1:23:32] when she touched it to prove that it
[1:23:34] stopped jesus turned and said who
[1:23:36] touched me
[1:23:38] that's perfect faith
[1:23:40] and that same perfect faith tonight
[1:23:44] he brought it up 2 000 years
[1:23:47] that perfect faith tonight will touch
[1:23:50] jesus christ just as it did then
[1:23:53] that woman came with a perfect faith for
[1:23:56] that time
[1:23:58] notice now another talking about perfect
[1:23:59] faith 1963 we'll close here in just a
[1:24:01] second
[1:24:02] perfect faith is a master
[1:24:06] of all
[1:24:07] circumstances
[1:24:10] perfect faith masters all
[1:24:13] circumstances no matter what it is it
[1:24:16] masters it
[1:24:18] when you believe anything do anything
[1:24:20] and you got faith in what you're doing
[1:24:21] no matter what the circumstance is
[1:24:24] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:24:27] see it masters that circumstance if it's
[1:24:30] in a room of sickness and the lord
[1:24:31] reveals that this certain thing is going
[1:24:32] to happen you just speak it and go on
[1:24:35] oh don't uh don't don't don't no don't
[1:24:37] ask any questions
[1:24:39] don't ask any questions
[1:24:41] it masters
[1:24:42] all circumstances
[1:24:46] paul one day was on a
[1:24:48] was on a boat
[1:24:50] with clothes right here paul was on a
[1:24:51] boat
[1:24:53] god told him he had to go to rome
[1:24:56] remember
[1:24:59] he said i got to go to rome
[1:25:01] you remember they tried to stop him
[1:25:04] but he said i must go to the room god
[1:25:05] wants me to go to rome all right god
[1:25:07] said so
[1:25:08] keep that in your heart
[1:25:10] so here's paul he gets on a boat
[1:25:13] he gets in the boat
[1:25:14] and they go down through there to cyprus
[1:25:16] or wherever it is
[1:25:18] and the seas are just all over the place
[1:25:20] remember the story
[1:25:22] season is all over the place
[1:25:24] they start dumping cargo so if they
[1:25:26] start dumping cargo they ain't a lot of
[1:25:27] food left
[1:25:28] they ain't a lot of good water left when
[1:25:30] they start dumping cargo to lighten the
[1:25:31] load to get the boat up above the waves
[1:25:34] everybody with me
[1:25:35] paul's on the boat with 140 i believe
[1:25:37] people are 120 something people you're
[1:25:39] reading your bible
[1:25:41] you read the specifics i'm just going to
[1:25:42] tell you the story all right so they
[1:25:44] lightened the load and it still
[1:25:48] the bible says was contrary the wind was
[1:25:50] contrary in other words it was not
[1:25:51] blowing them to land it was blowing them
[1:25:53] out
[1:25:55] so they're getting together and they
[1:25:56] said look we're going to let down the
[1:25:58] boats and we're going to get off this
[1:25:59] ship
[1:26:00] as many as we can get off the ship paul
[1:26:02] said stop
[1:26:06] come on somebody faith masters all
[1:26:09] circumstances
[1:26:10] paul jumped up and said stop
[1:26:13] there was an angel came
[1:26:16] there was an angel came to me last night
[1:26:18] and said if you'll stay on this boat now
[1:26:21] how contrary is that
[1:26:23] to your carnal mind get off the boat
[1:26:26] it's sinking
[1:26:27] they were sailors they knew the water
[1:26:30] they knew the waves they knew how much
[1:26:32] that luke you're getting so big good
[1:26:34] grief what a young man good looking kid
[1:26:39] but they said this boat's not gonna make
[1:26:41] it
[1:26:42] paul said if you'll stay on this boat
[1:26:44] now god told me the boat was gonna be
[1:26:46] destroyed
[1:26:47] but he said if you'll stay on this boat
[1:26:51] every life not one life will be lost
[1:26:55] so they must have believed paul
[1:26:57] faith masters all
[1:26:59] circumstances
[1:27:01] now that's not the end of the story
[1:27:02] because remember the boat breaks apart
[1:27:05] and they're actually we watched there
[1:27:07] was a movie about that one time and
[1:27:08] they're they're on the you know they're
[1:27:10] they're hanging on pieces of the ship
[1:27:11] and they're finally making it to shore
[1:27:13] well there's a group of natives there
[1:27:16] so when paul comes up he must be a
[1:27:18] pretty personable guy because they look
[1:27:20] at paul and say
[1:27:22] well he must be a demon
[1:27:24] read the bible
[1:27:25] he must be a demon because he must have
[1:27:27] done something wrong he must have been a
[1:27:29] murderer
[1:27:30] he must have been a killer because
[1:27:32] because the gods they believe in gods
[1:27:35] the gods
[1:27:36] have broken up their ship
[1:27:39] and if i was paul i'd be going but
[1:27:41] nobody's dead
[1:27:43] i said nobody die the angel told me
[1:27:45] nobody would die
[1:27:46] just like the angel came to brother rama
[1:27:48] stood beside him in the cave and said
[1:27:50] get the people to believe who you are
[1:27:53] get to believe you and even cancer
[1:27:55] won't stand in your way
[1:27:57] amen
[1:27:58] paul had an angel brother branham had an
[1:28:01] angel
[1:28:01] you got one it's just hard to
[1:28:02] communicate with him
[1:28:04] hey man
[1:28:05] so anyway so paul
[1:28:07] they're saying well man this guy must
[1:28:09] have really messed up he's the head of
[1:28:10] this gang and they're all their boats
[1:28:12] destroyed they're stuck on this island
[1:28:15] there's no way for them to get off
[1:28:17] the gods must be really against them
[1:28:20] must be a murderer i think the bible
[1:28:22] says
[1:28:24] so paul
[1:28:26] goes together in wood to build a fire
[1:28:28] must have been pretty cold
[1:28:30] so he starts gathering wood
[1:28:33] and they're all watching him
[1:28:35] because he's a murderer
[1:28:37] he's got a devil on him
[1:28:39] all right everybody with me and this
[1:28:42] black mamba
[1:28:45] the bible didn't say it bit him it said
[1:28:47] it latched on his hand
[1:28:50] now to be bit and fall off is not so bad
[1:28:52] but when
[1:28:53] even with a b or anything if something
[1:28:55] latches on to you they're just shooting
[1:28:57] poison just as fast as they can shoot in
[1:28:59] your body
[1:29:00] because they're going through those
[1:29:01] hypodermic needles that are called teeth
[1:29:03] fangs
[1:29:04] said it latched onto paul's hand
[1:29:06] the bible said paul shook it off
[1:29:09] and kept getting wood
[1:29:12] and what did the natives say they turned
[1:29:13] their whole perspective around and said
[1:29:16] he must be a god
[1:29:19] so he went from being a devil to being
[1:29:21] god but you know what his faith
[1:29:28] when that poison that would have killed
[1:29:29] him in a couple of minutes
[1:29:31] went up his arm faith
[1:29:35] mastered that
[1:29:36] circumstance and changed it into nothing
[1:29:39] but maybe water
[1:29:41] it probably changed it into blood but it
[1:29:43] mastered
[1:29:44] his circumstance because he knew he had
[1:29:47] to go to rome he couldn't die on that
[1:29:49] island
[1:29:51] when you and i realize we can't die
[1:29:54] unless god's finished with us
[1:29:57] there's no way look at daniel
[1:30:00] daniel in the lion's den listen they
[1:30:02] didn't put him down there with a bunch
[1:30:03] of
[1:30:04] kittens amen
[1:30:07] and to be truthful they probably didn't
[1:30:10] feed those lives for about two or three
[1:30:12] days so they were real
[1:30:13] hungry
[1:30:16] and you know what they had eat human
[1:30:17] flesh before
[1:30:20] amen
[1:30:21] so they're letting daniel down and
[1:30:23] they're going that one's mine
[1:30:26] no that one's mine
[1:30:27] now there's enough for both of us we'll
[1:30:29] just tear him apart and eat him up
[1:30:31] when that saints foot hit the ground
[1:30:34] the bible told daniel though
[1:30:37] he was going to come out of captivity
[1:30:41] come on people
[1:30:42] he took the promise of god he said two
[1:30:44] more years i'm leaving this place
[1:30:47] right
[1:30:48] two more years i've been in captivity 68
[1:30:51] years
[1:30:52] i got two more years and god promised me
[1:30:55] god said so
[1:30:57] that i'm gonna get out of here these
[1:30:59] lines have nothing
[1:31:01] nothing to bring
[1:31:03] so the faith that went with daniel when
[1:31:05] his feet hit the ground they were going
[1:31:12] and knowing daniel he probably sat down
[1:31:14] right beside of them and he just
[1:31:18] if i was in there i'd say look you can
[1:31:19] have the next guy but you're not getting
[1:31:20] me
[1:31:25] faith
[1:31:26] in the old testament
[1:31:28] mastered
[1:31:30] the lines
[1:31:31] and shut their mouth
[1:31:33] shut them up
[1:31:35] how many lines do you want shut up in
[1:31:37] your life
[1:31:39] listen we're in a lion's den every day
[1:31:41] when we walk out in that world
[1:31:43] there's something or somebody wanting to
[1:31:45] eat us up all the time
[1:31:48] but when faith masters that circumstance
[1:31:50] see
[1:31:51] it masters all
[1:31:54] all
[1:31:56] circumstances
[1:31:58] you know why
[1:31:59] because god said so
[1:32:02] god gave paul a promise listen god gave
[1:32:03] david a promise
[1:32:05] you know what david did david walked out
[1:32:08] he didn't worry about he he didn't go
[1:32:10] kinda like joshua
[1:32:12] joshua goes up to the city of walls of
[1:32:14] jericho and joshua being a
[1:32:17] a a warrior he probably said
[1:32:20] all right that thing's gonna remember
[1:32:21] they could run chariot races across it
[1:32:24] it had to be 70 or 80 feet thick
[1:32:27] and probably 40 or 50 feet high because
[1:32:30] people built their houses on the side of
[1:32:31] this thing but now did joshua go now let
[1:32:34] me calculate it's going to take
[1:32:37] 2 000 pounds of dynamite
[1:32:40] and it's going to take us born a hole
[1:32:42] right through here
[1:32:45] god said walk around the thing for seven
[1:32:47] times
[1:32:49] and on your seventh time shout
[1:32:52] joshua didn't call it didn't get caught
[1:32:54] up in measurements
[1:32:55] he didn't get caught up in all the
[1:32:57] stones and the bricks and the rebar and
[1:32:59] all the different things he looked past
[1:33:01] that he looked at the promise of god
[1:33:03] and faith met that circumstance you know
[1:33:05] what when they blew that trumpet brother
[1:33:08] john
[1:33:11] disappeared
[1:33:13] in the ground
[1:33:15] and they just walked right over
[1:33:17] how many of you want to do that
[1:33:20] we want faith to master
[1:33:23] our circumstances
[1:33:25] david
[1:33:26] you gonna die son
[1:33:28] no i'm not
[1:33:30] i had a prophet
[1:33:32] i had a prophet prophesy over me and he
[1:33:34] poured oil on my head and he said i was
[1:33:37] going to be king of israel
[1:33:39] and even a giant don't care how big he
[1:33:41] is how many brothers he's got
[1:33:43] until i sit on that throne i can't die
[1:33:47] faith mastered
[1:33:49] that circumstance
[1:33:51] let's have faith
[1:33:53] the challenges of life
[1:33:56] the challenges of things that we do
[1:33:58] every day
[1:34:00] faith will master those circumstances if
[1:34:02] you'll let them do it
[1:34:04] what about
[1:34:06] from here
[1:34:08] to here is only just a foot or two
[1:34:12] and that poison as soon as it goes in
[1:34:15] boom i mean three minutes i think black
[1:34:17] mama three minutes you're dead three
[1:34:18] minutes
[1:34:20] cut your oxygen off you your lungs
[1:34:22] paralyzed um you've seen poison before i
[1:34:25] guess um
[1:34:27] that works in your body but something
[1:34:30] took over
[1:34:31] that he didn't need to go to a pharmacy
[1:34:37] he just said i got to go to wrong
[1:34:40] because god said so
[1:34:43] let's stand our feet
[1:34:46] coach god said so
[1:34:49] when we can realize that we're the bride
[1:34:51] of jesus christ in the end time and god
[1:34:53] said will not die
[1:34:55] somebody will come to perfection someone
[1:34:58] will come to the statue of a perfect man
[1:35:00] someone will destroy death that has been
[1:35:03] reigning for at least six thousand years
[1:35:06] something that our mind cannot
[1:35:09] comprehend but god said i renew it
[1:35:13] i'll put something in there that the
[1:35:14] world don't have
[1:35:16] i'll put faith
[1:35:17] the sixth sense
[1:35:19] in you
[1:35:21] and you'll be like daniel
[1:35:23] you'll be like paul
[1:35:24] you'll be like david like i said before
[1:35:27] god does not deal in numbers
[1:35:29] never has never will he can take one guy
[1:35:31] moses and destroy a nation as big as the
[1:35:33] united states
[1:35:35] listen russia's built up for years
[1:35:36] nuclear bombs and and millions of of of
[1:35:39] soldiers
[1:35:41] just to beat the united states
[1:35:43] god sent one man moses and he destroyed
[1:35:46] a nation
[1:35:47] the size of the united states
[1:35:49] our god
[1:35:50] is a wonderful god
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:55] if you have a need just for a moment
[1:35:58] oh if not we're going to continue right
[1:36:00] into the
[1:36:02] communion and foot washing
[1:36:03] god bless you we love you we love the
[1:36:05] lord thank you all for coming
[1:36:07] i hope that we our faith faith is the
[1:36:10] substance of things hoped for
[1:36:12] the evidence of things not seen listen
[1:36:14] have faith in the word of god don't put
[1:36:15] your faith in your car put your faith in
[1:36:18] politics and put your faith put your
[1:36:19] faith in god
[1:36:21] paul put his faith put his faith in god
[1:36:22] because god said so god told him he's
[1:36:24] going to rome so he said no i can't die
[1:36:26] till i go to rome
[1:36:27] well you and i we're the bride of jesus
[1:36:29] christ somebody's going to come to body
[1:36:31] change
[1:36:32] somebody's going to
[1:36:34] wipe death off of their sleeve
[1:36:38] faith masters
[1:36:40] all
[1:36:41] circumstances
[1:36:43] the prophet of god was never nervous
[1:36:44] when he had a prayer line
[1:36:46] he was never nervous when he took those
[1:36:47] demons all in control i'm sure the
[1:36:50] demons were just hopping back and forth
[1:36:51] in that other dimension
[1:36:53] didn't bother him
[1:36:56] because faith
[1:36:58] he got met with an angel
[1:37:00] and the angel gave him a commission
[1:37:02] he said they'll nothing stand before you
[1:37:04] and he said not even cancer
[1:37:06] so i mean he took it all not even cancer
[1:37:09] if you get the people to believe you and
[1:37:11] have faith so let's bow our heads just
[1:37:12] for a minute
[1:37:14] dear lord thank you for this day that
[1:37:15] you give us
[1:37:17] thank you for lord
[1:37:19] your people
[1:37:22] this is the pride
[1:37:24] of heaven
[1:37:25] but we're on earth now
[1:37:28] and lord i pray that you would be with
[1:37:29] each one of us lord
[1:37:32] may we confess until we can possess
[1:37:36] confess our faults one to the other
[1:37:39] lord i want to be possessed
[1:37:41] i want to be possessed by the almighty
[1:37:44] the world is possessed by demons and all
[1:37:46] and the chief devil himself
[1:37:50] but father many years ago you cleared
[1:37:52] that out of my soul
[1:37:54] and you put yourself in there
[1:37:56] lord now i pray that that will work
[1:37:58] itself out
[1:37:59] and the people here lord it will work
[1:38:00] itself out in them too lord
[1:38:03] that it'll work its way out like that
[1:38:04] little cocoon a little worm there's a
[1:38:06] butterfly in there somewhere it's just
[1:38:08] got to work its way out
[1:38:10] lord just be with us and sanctify us
[1:38:12] lord for this journey that we're on be
[1:38:14] with the ones that are sick lord even if
[1:38:16] we've seen people healed
[1:38:18] taking communion
[1:38:19] lord because it's what it's an is
[1:38:21] something that you promised
[1:38:23] you told us we'll read it here in the
[1:38:25] scripture that if we eat bad it's going
[1:38:27] to give us bad stuff but if we eat good
[1:38:29] then we have good
[1:38:30] lord just sanctify us and keep us
[1:38:32] blessed us in jesus name
[1:38:35] amen the bible says for i have received
[1:38:37] of the lord that which i also delivered
[1:38:38] unto you that the same night the lord
[1:38:40] jesus the same night in which he was
[1:38:42] betrayed took bread
[1:38:43] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:38:45] and said take eat this is my body
[1:38:47] which is broken for you this due in
[1:38:49] remembrance
[1:38:50] of me after the same manner also he took
[1:38:52] the cup
[1:38:53] and when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:38:55] is the new testament
[1:38:57] in my blood this do ye as often as you
[1:39:00] drink it
[1:39:01] in remembrance of me
[1:39:03] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:39:04] drink this cup
[1:39:06] you do shoe the door or show the lord's
[1:39:08] death
[1:39:09] till he come
[1:39:10] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:39:12] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:39:14] unworthily shall be guilty
[1:39:16] of the body and blood of the lord
[1:39:18] but let a man examine himself
[1:39:20] and sow let him eat of that bread and
[1:39:22] drink of that cup
[1:39:24] for he that eateth eateth and drinketh
[1:39:26] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:39:29] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:39:31] body
[1:39:32] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:39:34] among you
[1:39:35] wow
[1:39:36] and many sleep
[1:39:38] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:39:39] should not be judged but when we are
[1:39:41] judged
[1:39:42] we are chastened of the lord that we
[1:39:44] should not be condemned with the world
[1:39:46] thank god
[1:39:48] that's our promise we'll not be
[1:39:49] condemned with the world the world's
[1:39:50] going to be destroyed you're not
[1:39:53] wherefore my brother when you come
[1:39:54] together to eat terry
[1:39:56] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:39:58] lady meet at home and that you come not
[1:40:00] together under condemnation and the rest
[1:40:02] will i set an order
[1:40:03] when i come let's just have a few
[1:40:05] moments of silent prayer
[1:40:07] the prophet said pray for you pastor
[1:40:09] the pastor pray for you
[1:40:11] ask forgiveness if you need forgiveness
[1:40:13] confess if you need to confess but let's
[1:40:15] get this out of the way because we want
[1:40:17] to be pure in god
[1:40:19] i want to be able to take communion
[1:40:20] listen when i wasn't a christian i i was
[1:40:23] afraid of taking communion because i
[1:40:24] knew what it did to me
[1:40:26] but now the bible tells us to come
[1:40:28] boldly
[1:40:30] to the throne of grace
[1:40:32] take this communion if you have ought
[1:40:34] against somebody
[1:40:35] god knows if you're going to straighten
[1:40:36] it out or not
[1:40:37] if you straighten it out then go ahead
[1:40:39] and take communion if you don't then
[1:40:41] you're going to suffer the condemnation
[1:40:43] amen so let's power his
[1:40:56] lord we ask your blessings in jesus name
[1:40:58] amen
[1:41:00] the bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:41:01] it dear heavenly father again we come to
[1:41:04] this day lord
[1:41:05] that this bread lord was made with holy
[1:41:07] hands made with water and flower
[1:41:10] nothing added to it lord
[1:41:13] and that's the way you are there was
[1:41:14] nothing added to you father
[1:41:16] lord i pray that you would bless each
[1:41:17] one that partakes of this communion
[1:41:18] father and sanctify us in jesus name
[1:41:21] amen
[1:41:26] every time i do this i know probably
[1:41:29] terence is too young
[1:41:31] we used to sit on the countertop up
[1:41:33] there that house on top of the hill and
[1:41:34] mom and daddy would bring out the bread
[1:41:36] it'd be in the freezer in a box a little
[1:41:39] square away for about like that what am
[1:41:41] i about that big
[1:41:42] white as a sheet but it froze it was
[1:41:45] held over
[1:41:46] this is not going to be held over you
[1:41:48] know what i'm going to do with this one
[1:41:49] what's over what's over with this when
[1:41:51] there's what brother donnie gets all
[1:41:53] that up off the ground
[1:41:54] i'm going to take it home and i'm going
[1:41:55] to take a blow torch
[1:41:57] and i'm going to burn it to a crisp
[1:41:59] where nothing
[1:42:00] can eat it or even want to eat it it
[1:42:02] stinks actually gets all in your clothes
[1:42:04] but you know what we're doing that
[1:42:06] because we're not holding over
[1:42:08] we're getting new revelation the next
[1:42:10] time we're getting new revelation the
[1:42:11] next day
[1:42:13] we're not going to live off of old bread
[1:42:16] we're living off the living word of god
[1:42:18] so this will all be burnt to a crisp
[1:42:20] tonight
[1:42:21] before the day break comes
[1:42:23] we'll take a torch and just blow this to
[1:42:25] pieces
[1:42:27] and it'll be just a charred mess but you
[1:42:30] know what right now
[1:42:32] pretty good for you
[1:42:34] amen so this is an institution that god
[1:42:36] told us to do
[1:42:38] he told us to do this so so
[1:42:40] why are we going wrong we're not going
[1:42:41] wrong by doing it
[1:42:43] we're going wrong by not doing it amen
[1:42:48] i just want to let you know that's what
[1:42:50] we do i mean we don't hold this over we
[1:42:51] burn it i'll burn it every night when we
[1:42:53] have communion
[1:42:57] dear heavenly father lord this wine has
[1:42:58] been made by holy hands
[1:43:00] and i pray now father that it will
[1:43:03] be consumed lord and and we can when we
[1:43:06] close our eyes lord we can see you
[1:43:08] standing that night in front of the
[1:43:09] disciples
[1:43:11] and saying eat this bread and drink this
[1:43:13] cup
[1:43:14] because it shows the lord death until he
[1:43:16] comes lord we know you came and i know
[1:43:18] some people are not taking communion
[1:43:20] because they said jesus came in 1963 but
[1:43:23] that's not what the bible said
[1:43:25] the bible says to take this until you
[1:43:27] come
[1:43:28] and i believe in a physical coming here
[1:43:30] not to the earth but a coming and a
[1:43:31] bride and then we meet you in the air
[1:43:33] but until then lord we're going to
[1:43:34] continue to take communion we're going
[1:43:36] to continue to be washed by the water of
[1:43:38] the word continue to take the bread and
[1:43:40] and the cup lord and drink it and not
[1:43:43] drink an unworthily father just bless
[1:43:44] the people as they partake in jesus name
[1:43:46] amen
[1:43:49] come morning
[1:43:50] i'll wall
[1:43:52] by the river
[1:43:56] i'll rest near the
[1:44:00] evergreen tree
[1:44:03] i'll carry my cross there's a cross you
[1:44:07] gotta bear
[1:44:08] the midnight
[1:44:11] come morning
[1:44:13] there's glory
[1:44:16] for me
[1:44:18] sometimes i'm despised
[1:44:22] oh the world hates us satan really hates
[1:44:24] us
[1:44:26] and i
[1:44:27] question oh father
[1:44:31] how long
[1:44:34] then i take one
[1:44:37] more look
[1:44:39] at mount calvary
[1:44:42] and what does it do it renews my mind
[1:44:45] it gives me the strength
[1:44:47] to go on
[1:44:50] good morning
[1:44:52] i'll walk
[1:44:54] the prophet of god said sometime between
[1:44:55] six and nine in the morning when the
[1:44:57] rapture takes place we're going home
[1:45:00] we're gonna go to a place
[1:45:02] with the greenest grass you've ever seen
[1:45:04] in your life
[1:45:06] the brightest day you've ever seen in
[1:45:07] your life
[1:45:09] no clouds in the sky
[1:45:12] no sorrow
[1:45:14] no hard days
[1:45:15] and i know we're doing it now we're
[1:45:16] having heartaches and sorrow
[1:45:21] but the bible says those who endure to
[1:45:23] the end
[1:45:25] endure
[1:45:27] endure sickness endure heartache endure
[1:45:29] trouble trials
[1:45:31] your family turns against you
[1:45:33] the world turns against you you your
[1:45:35] neighbors
[1:45:37] your co-workers can't understand you you
[1:45:39] know why because your mind's not like
[1:45:40] theirs
[1:45:41] it used to be
[1:45:43] i hope they see a difference now
[1:45:45] if not you need to renew your mind
[1:45:49] because out of the heart proceedeth all
[1:45:51] things
[1:45:52] but it has to go through here and come
[1:45:54] out you gotta think it before you say it
[1:45:59] let's start thinking on these things
[1:46:01] we've talked about last night brother
[1:46:02] dale always said that for years for
[1:46:04] those of y'all that that weren't here in
[1:46:06] the early stages in the 90s and 2000s he
[1:46:08] would always say think on these things
[1:46:12] amen and then brother louise picked it
[1:46:13] up and preached sermon on him
[1:46:15] think
[1:46:16] well think about what i said today
[1:46:18] you're just going to say well it was a
[1:46:19] good sermon and go home and
[1:46:21] here's life
[1:46:24] build on it please
[1:46:27] i hope hope it didn't sweat for nothing
[1:46:31] i usually try not to do that but
[1:46:35] you just get happy when you start
[1:46:36] talking about faith because faith is the
[1:46:38] substance of things hoped for
[1:46:40] evidence of things not seen if you can
[1:46:42] see it i can see this water bottle i
[1:46:44] don't have faith that that water bottle
[1:46:45] is there
[1:46:46] but like brother adam said it was so
[1:46:48] simple he said he said now i may have he
[1:46:50] said i may have left my pocket knife
[1:46:53] on the
[1:46:54] on the dresser in the motel room he said
[1:46:56] but i'm going to believe it's in my
[1:46:57] pocket and he reached down his pocket
[1:46:59] and pulled it out now whether it was
[1:47:00] there or not i don't know but he said he
[1:47:02] might have left it left it there
[1:47:04] that's how simple faith is
[1:47:07] simply believing what that god said so
[1:47:10] paul
[1:47:12] how did you survive that snake bite god
[1:47:14] said so
[1:47:15] god said i was going to rome and i
[1:47:17] hadn't gotten to rome yet david how'd
[1:47:18] you kill that kill goliath
[1:47:21] god said so
[1:47:23] he said i was going to be a king and i
[1:47:24] wasn't a king yet so i'm going to
[1:47:25] believe what god said i don't believe
[1:47:26] what my anointing prophet told me
[1:47:28] let's partake
[1:47:33] thank you lord
[1:47:40] the supper being ended the devil having
[1:47:42] now put in the heart of judah says
[1:47:43] carrot simon's son to betray him
[1:47:45] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:47:47] all things into his hands and he was
[1:47:48] come from god
[1:47:50] and he went to god he rises from supper
[1:47:53] and laid aside his garments and took a
[1:47:54] towel
[1:47:56] wow
[1:47:57] what about a servant
[1:47:59] this man created the ground in nelton
[1:48:02] created the cloth that he used created
[1:48:04] the water that he used
[1:48:07] created the people that were standing in
[1:48:09] front of him
[1:48:11] and he washed their feet
[1:48:14] and ain't like now
[1:48:15] jerusalem was pretty muddy and pretty uh
[1:48:18] nasty with all the stuff you know
[1:48:20] brother brown talks about that when he
[1:48:22] talks about washing jesus's feet you
[1:48:24] know when the lady with her hair
[1:48:27] said oh said there was donkeys and all
[1:48:30] kind of things walking you're walking
[1:48:31] right over it right through it
[1:48:34] that's not now
[1:48:35] but we still wash each other's feet
[1:48:38] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:48:39] all things into his hands and he was
[1:48:41] come from god and went to god
[1:48:44] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:48:46] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:48:47] himself
[1:48:48] after that he poureth water into a base
[1:48:51] and then began to wash the disciples
[1:48:52] feed and wipe them with the towel
[1:48:54] wherewith he was girded
[1:48:55] then cometh he to simon peter
[1:48:58] and peter said unto him lord dost thou
[1:49:00] wash my feet
[1:49:02] jesus said
[1:49:04] what i do they'll know it's not now
[1:49:08] but you will
[1:49:10] when i come back as the comforter and i
[1:49:12] go inside of you you're going to
[1:49:13] understand what i said
[1:49:16] what i do thou knowest not now but thou
[1:49:18] shalt know hereafter
[1:49:21] peter said unto him thou shalt never
[1:49:26] wash my feet
[1:49:29] well there's peter with he's fixing to
[1:49:30] stick his foot in his mouth
[1:49:33] in just a second
[1:49:35] because jesus answered and said if i

[1:49:38] with me
[1:49:39] peter had enough sense to go sorry lord
[1:49:43] don't just wash my feet wash my hands
[1:49:45] and my head just give me a total washing
[1:49:47] and jesus said no

[1:49:51] his feet but is clean ever with and you
[1:49:52] are not all clean for he knew who should
[1:49:55] betray him therefore he said you're not
[1:49:56] all clean so after he had washed their
[1:49:58] feet and had taken his garment was set
[1:50:00] down again he said unto them know you
[1:50:01] what i have done unto you now that's a
[1:50:03] question mark
[1:50:04] he's asking him do you not know what

[1:50:09] you call me mastering lord and you say
[1:50:11] well for so i am
