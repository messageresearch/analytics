[19:20] I cannot fall for his greater than all
[19:24] in all the blood of the land
[19:30] [Music]
[19:36] I guess uh let me share with you I know
[19:38] uh all of you it's been here Church know
[19:41] that I've had experiences with kidney
[19:45] stones had five as a matter of fact
[19:47] anybody else had more than five
[19:51] it's not fun a lot of pain very painful
[19:56] but I've learned how to raise my pain
[19:59] level so that it I can tolerate pain
[20:04] but around September 18th
[20:08] I
[20:10] had a pain hit me in my uh back
[20:15] a little higher than what would have
[20:16] been a kidney stone but I thought it was
[20:18] a kidney stone so carried it around for
[20:20] a week or two
[20:22] and then I decided I'd go to the doctor
[20:25] and get it checked out we did a urine
[20:27] test and
[20:28] everything we normally do when we he
[20:30] checks me and
[20:32] he calls me uh
[20:35] that was around the 18th on the 21st he
[20:38] called me and said uh
[20:40] there's no evidence of a stone
[20:43] and uh
[20:45] I said where's the pain coming from he
[20:47] said I don't know he said I'm going to
[20:49] order you an MR
[20:52] all right
[20:53] yeah
[20:58] so well
[21:01] I get a call about the MRI
[21:04] and they said you need to come in
[21:08] so here's what they've had
[21:18] your body's full of cysts
[21:23] you're
[21:25] the right flank pain you have
[21:28] could be caused by a cancer of the
[21:30] kidney
[21:35] you have cysts scattered on your liver
[21:40] you're cold
[21:44] your pancreas has a seven millimeter
[21:48] assists with lesions three millimeters
[21:50] in length
[21:54] both kidneys have cysts 2.4
[21:58] by 2.3 centimeters
[22:03] eight by seven millimeter leisure
[22:10] lymph nodes eight millimeters
[22:16] both the hooks
[22:24] so we can only imagine
[22:28] from September
[22:31] until now
[22:34] what I've been walking it
[22:37] has affected my breathing at some point
[22:40] I don't wait I said
[22:42] I may have to give up singing
[22:44] because
[22:47] my lung capacity doesn't feel like it's
[22:49] right
[22:51] I'd stop you'll see me stop in the
[22:53] middle of a verse or so
[22:57] so
[22:59] they said I had five gallstones okay on
[23:02] top of that
[23:03] like I needed something else
[23:08] so
[23:11] he said the right pain the flank pain
[23:14] and
[23:16] Amy's looked at my charts and
[23:19] talked about the
[23:22] you know so what caused that pain how
[23:23] long what about the pain and he says
[23:26] well this is what happens isn't that
[23:28] that sister burst and it's like a
[23:32] releasing stuff in your body
[23:35] so
[23:37] so we're going to watch it
[23:40] so I come back
[23:42] the pain gets a little sharper and
[23:44] because when I had awesome my eyes are
[23:46] not in 2007 that brother Dale remembers
[23:49] they can talk they thought that was
[23:50] cancer at one time
[23:52] and we got through that the Lord healed
[23:55] me before the
[23:56] I was supposed to finish my 45-day
[23:59] treatment
[24:01] well anyway

[24:08] another MRI

[53:49] Hallelujah
[53:51] it would be something if you had a
[53:53] desire to see him
[53:56] and yet there was no way that that could
[53:58] possibly be
[54:00] how miserable we would be
[54:04] but there's a deep that caused unto the
[54:06] Deep
[54:07] and if there's something in US longing
[54:09] to see him that's the evidence There's A
[54:11] Hymn for us to see
[54:13] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:15] forever
[54:16] if you have your Bibles turn with us to
[54:18] the book of Acts I want to read from
[54:19] Acts chapter 28 starting at verse 1 and
[54:21] I know you've done been here for a while
[54:23] so we'll be just as quick as we can and
[54:25] we pray the Lord are just bless you in a
[54:28] great way today and
[54:30] we appreciate the testimonies and I was
[54:33] thinking it was talking about the prayer
[54:34] class while you're turning there I
[54:35] remember
[54:36] I think it was
[54:38] 2012 or
[54:40] 13 it was it was the year that Haiti had
[54:42] the earthquake when we was in Nicaragua
[54:44] for the Youth Camp that year at a place
[54:45] called Skylark and we had a huge prayer
[54:48] line that evening and so we was tearing
[54:50] off pieces of our handkerchief and
[54:51] giving it to the young people and said
[54:52] now when the Lord meets your need you
[54:55] send this back to us as a testimony of
[54:57] what the Lord did for you and before the
[54:59] prayer line was over those that was in
[55:00] front of the line was coming back around
[55:02] and giving us pieces of the crowd calls
[55:04] back the Lord
[55:06] amen it was wonderful
[55:10] I remember one year there's a brother
[55:12] came through the prayer line he was
[55:14] almost been over at a 90 degree angle I
[55:16] don't know if brother Louise was there
[55:17] that year or not but he was been over
[55:19] almost he's a bricklayer had blowed out
[55:21] his back laying brick and he came
[55:23] through the prayer line and before he
[55:25] got out the end of it the Lord had
[55:27] healed the man and he was standing
[55:29] straight up and he shouted that place to
[55:31] the ground it's just wonderful what God
[55:34] can do amen
[55:38] but he's the same right here in Lula
[55:40] Georgia
[55:41] amen
[55:43] Acts chapter 28 verse 1 we appreciate
[55:45] the opportunity to be here this morning
[55:48] appreciate brother Samuel and brother
[55:49] Wade
[55:51] acts 28 1. do you love him
[55:55] and when they were escaped and they knew
[55:56] that the island was called Melita I
[55:59] guess that's how you say it I'm not the
[56:01] sharpest knife in the drawer
[56:03] and the barbarious people showed us no
[56:05] little kindness for that Kindle to Fire
[56:07] and received us every one because of the
[56:10] present Reign and because of the cold
[56:13] and when Paul had gathered a bundle of
[56:15] sticks and laid them on the fire there
[56:16] came a viper out of the Heat and
[56:19] fastened on his hand
[56:21] and when The Barbarians saw that the
[56:23] venomous Beast hang on his hand they
[56:25] said among themselves
[56:28] no doubt this man is a murderer
[56:32] whom though he has escaped the sea yet
[56:35] Vengeance suffereth not to live
[56:39] and Paul shook off the Beast Into the
[56:42] Fire and felt no harm
[56:44] and how be it that they looked and when
[56:48] he should have swollen up or fallen down
[56:50] dead suddenly
[56:51] but after they looked the great wall and
[56:53] saw no harm come to him they changed
[56:57] their minds
[56:58] and said that he was a god
[57:05] oh my God
[57:07] how fast their opinion of Paul changed
[57:10] from being a murderer
[57:13] to a god
[57:15] when the snake venom met faith
[57:19] and that's what we want to speak on this
[57:21] morning when Faith was met
[57:24] Amen Let Us bow our heads
[57:27] Heavenly Father
[57:29] Thy word is true
[57:31] I commit this congregation
[57:34] and myself
[57:35] into your hands
[57:37] For Your Glory
[57:38] in Jesus name
[57:40] God bless you Saints you may be seated
[57:43] no brother Brandon has told us in the
[57:45] message perfect Faith he says perfect
[57:47] faith is the master of all circumstances
[57:50] amen perfect Faith Masters all
[57:54] circumstances no matter what it is
[57:57] it Masters it now just watch when you
[58:00] believe anything or do anything you've
[58:03] got to have faith in what you're doing
[58:05] we live in such a wishy-washy age when
[58:08] people are up and down and one day
[58:10] they're on fire and the next day they're
[58:11] cold and one day they're going but
[58:13] that's not what faith is
[58:15] when we come through those doors we need
[58:17] to come through those doors with a
[58:18] realization I am here for a purpose God
[58:22] could have put me in 88 she wanted to
[58:24] put me in but he put me in this age amen
[58:26] and he never put me here to fail but he
[58:28] put me here to overcome
[58:31] Hallelujah I am a Son of God whether I'm
[58:34] on the Mountaintop shouting the victory
[58:36] or whether I'm in the greatest battle of
[58:38] my life it does not determine who I am
[58:40] amen and when we come to those doors we
[58:43] need to come with the realization I am a
[58:45] son and a daughter of God and I have
[58:47] come to wreck havoc on Satan's kingdom
[58:51] Hallelujah
[58:52] Faith Masters that circumstance
[58:54] regardless of what it is you see faith
[58:58] is not a Hocus Pocus it's not a magic
[59:01] wand that you just wave over someone
[59:03] faith is not even what you feel
[59:07] faith is what you believe
[59:10] amen and faith has to have a resting
[59:14] place
[59:16] and the Bible teaches us that the word
[59:18] of God is the foundation that Faith
[59:21] rests upon
[59:23] the Bible says in Romans 3 4 said let
[59:26] God be true and every man a liar
[59:30] heavens and earth will pass away but not
[59:33] one word of God will fail us
[59:36] then we can sit here this morning with
[59:39] this confidence that God's word does not
[59:42] lie
[59:44] Nations will lie to us
[59:48] governments will lie to us politicians
[59:54] they'll lie to us
[59:55] and sometimes even people who are close
[59:58] to us will lie to us our feelings will
[1:00:02] lie to us our emotions will lie to us
[1:00:05] our Sensations will lie to us but the
[1:00:09] word of God Amen will never lie to us
[1:00:13] and every word of God is just as true as
[1:00:16] every word of God
[1:00:18] hey it's either all true or none of it's
[1:00:21] true
[1:00:22] the same God that said let there be
[1:00:24] light is there light
[1:00:26] did God keep his word that same God said
[1:00:29] behold I send you Elijah did he send him
[1:00:32] did he keep his word that same God said
[1:00:35] I am the Lord thy God who healeth all
[1:00:38] thy diseases
[1:00:42] Hallelujah
[1:00:44] and how does God prove his word to us
[1:00:46] God proves his word to us by bringing it
[1:00:50] to pass
[1:00:51] yes oh my the prophet said how I love
[1:00:55] him God always keeps his word God will
[1:00:58] keep his word every time
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:02] not 99 times out of a hundred
[1:01:05] those are pretty good odds
[1:01:08] I bet Vegas would like to have some odds
[1:01:10] like that that may be good for Vegas but
[1:01:13] it ain't good for God
[1:01:15] not 99 times out of 100 but 100 times
[1:01:19] out of a hundred God will keep his word
[1:01:23] yeah
[1:01:24] that's right Faith cometh by hearing
[1:01:26] appearing by the word of God when you
[1:01:29] hear what the word is saying to you
[1:01:33] you see it's a personal revelation
[1:01:38] you're not going to go because you're
[1:01:40] sending a message Church
[1:01:43] the devil goes to a message Church come
[1:01:45] on somebody
[1:01:46] but what is the new birth it's not
[1:01:49] signing your name on a road it's not
[1:01:51] shaking a preacher's hand it's not
[1:01:52] packing a spoken word book but what is
[1:01:55] the new birth it's Christ revealed to
[1:01:57] you personally
[1:02:00] Hallelujah you have met this person amen
[1:02:04] oh my God it's a personal revelation you
[1:02:08] and the word personally Hallelujah
[1:02:12] then no matter what the circumstance is
[1:02:14] they don't got one thing to do with it
[1:02:16] well the doctor says it's bad the
[1:02:19] situation is impossible circumstances
[1:02:21] has nothing to do with it when God says
[1:02:25] it'll be a certain way it will be that
[1:02:27] way
[1:02:27] [Applause]
[1:02:29] I remember when my daughter was struck
[1:02:31] by train and two of my family was killed
[1:02:33] and they gave us no hope and the doctors
[1:02:35] that I worked with I worked in surgery I
[1:02:37] could read in my eyes and CT scans and I
[1:02:40] knew all the medical terminology and
[1:02:42] they were coming to me and putting their
[1:02:43] arm around me telling me we're sorry
[1:02:45] Daryl your daughters hurt too bad she
[1:02:47] can't live her brain is damaged but God
[1:02:50] spoke to me Hallelujah sitting there in
[1:02:52] the waiting area at about two o'clock in
[1:02:54] the afternoon and he said your daughter
[1:02:56] shall live then it don't matter what the
[1:02:59] doctor says it doesn't matter what the
[1:03:01] CT scans God's word is true amen
[1:03:06] Hallelujah
[1:03:11] well you just imagine that you can say
[1:03:13] what you will all I know is she's 30
[1:03:15] year old today
[1:03:18] amen hallelujah
[1:03:20] Faith Masters that's circumstance
[1:03:23] amen Faith believes that God will work
[1:03:26] it out I don't know how he's going to do
[1:03:28] it but he's going to do it but he'll do
[1:03:31] it anyhow Faith Masters that
[1:03:34] circumstance and many times God don't
[1:03:36] ask us to understand right
[1:03:41] sometimes God says can you just trust me
[1:03:44] can you trust me that whatever you're
[1:03:47] going through right now it's for your
[1:03:49] good according to Romans 8 28 all things
[1:03:52] work to the good
[1:03:54] well I don't understand it sometimes he
[1:03:57] don't ask us to understand this again

[1:04:01] your life is bringing you to perfection
[1:04:07] Hallelujah
[1:04:08] Hallelujah
[1:04:10] Faith believes God will work it out I
[1:04:12] don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:04:14] to do it anyhow it Masters all
[1:04:16] circumstance you see faith and love is a
[1:04:20] relation
[1:04:23] you can't have faith unless you've got
[1:04:26] love
[1:04:28] because your faith is in a God Who is
[1:04:31] the very essence of love
[1:04:33] faith and love works together
[1:04:39] you see if he loved me enough to die for
[1:04:42] me so is that true if he loved us enough
[1:04:46] to die for us then don't he love us
[1:04:48] enough to heal us don't he love us
[1:04:49] enough to save me to deliver me to
[1:04:51] forgive me to Rapture me
[1:04:55] you have faith in the God who loves you
[1:04:57] and faith in what the word is saying
[1:04:59] about you
[1:05:02] Faith Masters every circumstance because
[1:05:05] it's not what you feel it's not what you
[1:05:08] see
[1:05:09] we don't see with the eyes of our head
[1:05:11] God gave us another set of us the eyes
[1:05:13] of our heart we see the Unseen we see
[1:05:16] what the eyes of the head cannot declare
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:20] yeah
[1:05:21] hallelujah it's not what you see it's
[1:05:24] not what you understand or what you
[1:05:26] reason out it's what you believe
[1:05:30] when you hear
[1:05:32] what the word is saying about you then
[1:05:36] that word takes preeminence
[1:05:39] over every circumstance
[1:05:42] when you see yourself
[1:05:45] in the scriptures
[1:05:47] let Mary the prophet of God said that
[1:05:50] that Sunday before that wash day on
[1:05:53] Monday when they were sitting on the
[1:05:54] porch of Joseph's house and then they
[1:05:56] was talking about the rabbi and about
[1:05:58] the sermon and Mary said you know I
[1:05:59] think it'd be good if we just read some
[1:06:01] scriptures and just said that's an
[1:06:02] excellent ideal and the prophet of God
[1:06:04] said she went in there and put out the
[1:06:06] scroll of Isaiah a virgin shall conceive
[1:06:08] and he said Mary said to Joseph Joseph
[1:06:10] dear what what the prophet Isaiah mean a
[1:06:13] virgin shall conceive and he gave the
[1:06:15] most famous profound statement that was
[1:06:18] ever spoke he looked at Mary and said I
[1:06:20] don't know
[1:06:23] I don't know but there's one thing I do
[1:06:25] know if God said it God will bring it to
[1:06:28] pass and we'll Hallelujah and the next
[1:06:30] day on the way down on a blue Monday
[1:06:33] wash day she ran into an angel who said
[1:06:36] Hail Mary thou has found favor with God
[1:06:39] and it was at that moment that Mary
[1:06:41] realized Isaiah was speaking of her
[1:06:47] it's me the word is speaking about me
[1:06:51] Hallelujah
[1:06:53] Hallelujah when you see yourself
[1:06:58] in the scriptures like Paul
[1:07:01] that we read about
[1:07:03] in Acts 23 10 it says that our Rose of
[1:07:06] great distinction and the chief Captain
[1:07:08] fear Elise Paul should be pulled to
[1:07:11] pieces of them
[1:07:12] commanded the soldiers to go down and
[1:07:14] take him by force from among them and
[1:07:17] bring him into the castle he said my God
[1:07:19] they're going to kill the man go get him
[1:07:24] and that night following while he was in
[1:07:27] the castle the Lord stood by him
[1:07:30] and said be of good cheer
[1:07:33] Paul
[1:07:34] for thou has testified of me in
[1:07:37] Jerusalem so must thou thou witness also
[1:07:40] at Rome
[1:07:42] so where is Paul headed
[1:07:45] to Rome why
[1:07:48] God said so
[1:07:51] how's it going to get there the
[1:07:54] circumstances doesn't matter
[1:07:56] he will get there because God said so
[1:08:03] and on his way there there arose a great
[1:08:07] storm
[1:08:08] 14 days and nights no man ate anything
[1:08:14] that's some kind of a storm
[1:08:16] the way we love to eat to have some kind
[1:08:19] of storms
[1:08:20] 14 days and nights
[1:08:23] and nobody took one bite of nothing
[1:08:26] but after a long absence as Paul stood
[1:08:29] forth in the midst of them and said sirs
[1:08:31] you should have hearkened unto me and
[1:08:33] not have loosed from crate to have
[1:08:35] gained this harm and this loss and now I
[1:08:38] exhort you to be of good cheer
[1:08:42] for there shall be no loss of in man's
[1:08:44] life among you but of the ship
[1:08:47] for that stood by me this night the
[1:08:49] angel of God whose I am and whom I serve
[1:08:52] saying fear not Paul
[1:08:55] oh God let us hear those words today
[1:08:57] it's such a neurotic age fear not little
[1:09:00] bride it's the father's good pleasure to
[1:09:03] give you the kingdom
[1:09:07] fear not Paul thou must be brought
[1:09:09] before Caesar and low God hath given
[1:09:11] thee all them that sell with thee
[1:09:16] why did the angel come and tell that to
[1:09:19] Paul how could he say such a thing he
[1:09:21] was saying what God had already said
[1:09:25] you know people come up for prayer and
[1:09:27] they say well the devil said this and
[1:09:29] the devil said that and the devil said
[1:09:31] this and I think sometimes they can't
[1:09:32] quote two good quotes but they can tell
[1:09:34] you everything the devil said
[1:09:37] and sometimes I wonder why do we listen
[1:09:39] to him why do you even listen to him
[1:09:46] amen
[1:09:48] stay with the word if you're going to
[1:09:50] quote something say what the word says I
[1:09:53] am an overcomer I am a son of God
[1:09:58] by his stripes I'm Healed
[1:10:01] well I don't feel healed that's got
[1:10:03] nothing to do with it
[1:10:05] we're not healed because we feel like it
[1:10:08] we're healed because the word said so
[1:10:11] oh yeah
[1:10:14] amen
[1:10:15] how could the Angels say such things he
[1:10:18] was saying what has already been said
[1:10:20] you must be a witness of me at Rome
[1:10:22] wherefore serves be of good cheer
[1:10:26] for I believe God
[1:10:30] anybody here believe God
[1:10:33] then be happy
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:10:35] be a good cheer well brother dial the
[1:10:38] economy and this and that and listen to
[1:10:40] me Trump ain't gonna fix it body ain't

[1:10:45] looking through a higher order amen
[1:10:47] he told us these things would come to
[1:10:49] pass he said when you see these things
[1:10:51] begin to happen lift up your head your
[1:10:54] redemption's almost night man we're not
[1:10:57] going down we're going up

[1:11:03] generals said by 2025 we'll be in a war
[1:11:05] with China and they got all these
[1:11:07] nuclear weapons and they all they got to
[1:11:09] do is push a button but let me tell you
[1:11:10] something the prophet of God said if
[1:11:12] they push that button before the bomb
[1:11:14] ever hits the United States this bride
[1:11:17] will be in glory
[1:11:20] then what are we we're just one button
[1:11:23] push away Hallelujah
[1:11:28] foreign
[1:11:30] land
[1:11:38] and some of the people on the ship
[1:11:41] started letting down these little boats
[1:11:44] acting like
[1:11:46] they were letting down anchors if I
[1:11:48] remember right the Bible says they were
[1:11:49] doing it under color
[1:11:53] but Paul said listen to me yeah you
[1:11:56] better stay off those websites
[1:11:59] you better you better not get off this
[1:12:02] ship get on some of these other ships
[1:12:04] listen to me the prophet of God said
[1:12:06] there's all kind of boats in Noah's day
[1:12:08] but there's only one boat that floated
[1:12:13] he said well I'm going to leave the
[1:12:14] message because I just want to get
[1:12:15] closer to Christ yeah and then you look
[1:12:17] at Facebook and they're wearing shorts
[1:12:18] and drinking beer they're really getting
[1:12:19] close
[1:12:22] somebody
[1:12:23] listen young people stay away from that
[1:12:25] nonsense stay with the word what did
[1:12:28] Paul tell them listen to me Brothers you
[1:12:30] better abide with this ship you better
[1:12:33] cut them boats loose and let them go and
[1:12:35] I say cut loose of the world Cut Loose
[1:12:37] of the things of the world
[1:12:40] don't you see what this nation's trying
[1:12:42] to do they're trying to divide us
[1:12:46] the prophet of God said that the Native
[1:12:49] Americans lost this country
[1:12:53] why because they were divided among
[1:12:56] themselves and the prophet said in the
[1:12:59] seals he said now remember America you
[1:13:01] sowed it now you're going to reap it
[1:13:04] right and what are they doing right now
[1:13:06] they're trying to divide Us by skin
[1:13:09] color all right come on somebody you
[1:13:12] might as well say man they're trying to
[1:13:13] divide Us by skin color they're trying
[1:13:15] to divide Us by political affiliation
[1:13:17] they're even trying to divide Us by
[1:13:19] vaccinations
[1:13:23] but that's Satan's tactic that's always
[1:13:26] been his tactic it's to divide and to
[1:13:28] conquer but I say to you little bride we
[1:13:31] are united
[1:13:32] Hallelujah by the blood of the Lamb of
[1:13:35] God
[1:13:36] yeah
[1:13:37] we are Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[1:13:41] God made us the way he wanted us to be
[1:13:44] right
[1:13:45] amen amen amen well I don't know where
[1:13:47] that come from but that's all right
[1:13:52] the ship finally broke up from the storm
[1:13:55] but notice what they did they took
[1:13:57] pieces of the ship and floated into the
[1:14:00] shore
[1:14:01] and building a fire to get dry and
[1:14:04] toward ball goes and gathers kindling
[1:14:07] and what a great lesson that is
[1:14:09] now Parker said listen boys I'm the
[1:14:11] church age messenger I'm the man of the
[1:14:13] hour I'm the prophet so I'm going to sit
[1:14:16] here now you boys go out there and get
[1:14:17] the wood
[1:14:18] no he led by example
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:23] you see people's got it so wrong
[1:14:28] the bride is not a servant to the
[1:14:30] ministry but the ministry is a servant
[1:14:33] to the bride
[1:14:35] the gift that's in brother Samuel's life
[1:14:37] and brother Louise's life and brother
[1:14:39] Wayne's life and his other brother's
[1:14:41] life brother brother black and different
[1:14:42] what that gift that's in their life is
[1:14:45] not for them it's for you
[1:14:48] God gave you that gift here
[1:14:52] then use the gifts that's among you amen
[1:14:59] he didn't setbackers and you boys you
[1:15:01] know he got any grapes I'm just gonna
[1:15:03] no he went out there and was gathering
[1:15:05] up wood
[1:15:07] and bringing it in unbeknownst to Paul
[1:15:10] there was a Viper
[1:15:12] that was in the wood and as he's thrown
[1:15:14] it in the fire it struck him on the hand
[1:15:17] and the Bible said that these these
[1:15:20] These are heathens because I can't say
[1:15:22] the other word of you excuse me
[1:15:24] they sit down to watch them die
[1:15:27] and they said this man must be some kind
[1:15:29] of evil to escape the storm and now be
[1:15:33] bit by a deadly snake
[1:15:37] now the Venom attacks the nervous system
[1:15:39] of this particular snake and it shuts
[1:15:42] down the breathing and they swell up and
[1:15:44] they die suddenly ain't no need to call
[1:15:47] 9-1-1 you're dead before you get the one
[1:15:49] dog
[1:15:50] all right they didn't even offer him any
[1:15:53] help they didn't even offer him any
[1:15:55] first date they just sat down to watch
[1:15:57] him die
[1:16:00] huh
[1:16:01] and that Venom coming up through Paul's
[1:16:05] body
[1:16:06] all at once that Venom
[1:16:08] met faith
[1:16:11] faith in the word that says you've got
[1:16:13] to go to Rome and appear to Caesar and
[1:16:16] when the Venom met faith that was oh God
[1:16:19] that was no more poison in the Venom
[1:16:23] en
[1:16:25] that's right Paul took the word of God
[1:16:28] over the fear of a deadly snake bite he
[1:16:31] just pitched it into the fire and
[1:16:33] gathered up more wood
[1:16:35] and the people of the island said
[1:16:37] he ain't a murderer
[1:16:40] he's a god
[1:16:46] my Lord
[1:16:47] think about that those heathens
[1:16:50] recognized that a man manifesting the
[1:16:53] word for his hour
[1:16:56] is deity and flesh
[1:17:00] and that's it
[1:17:05] they said Paul didn't say
[1:17:08] about it when I didn't die because he
[1:17:10] didn't say they said that
[1:17:13] okay God will make your enemy testify
[1:17:16] Who You Are
[1:17:20] a Son of God manifesting the word for
[1:17:22] his day his deity and flesh
[1:17:27] you got a quote for that yeah I do I'm
[1:17:31] glad you asked
[1:17:33] the prophet said when the Son of God by
[1:17:34] faith takes the word of God into his
[1:17:36] heart and speaks it back upon his lips
[1:17:39] it's just the same as guilty speaking
[1:17:44] that's right
[1:17:46] when he sat down and he didn't die they
[1:17:48] changed their mind he said this man's a
[1:17:49] god
[1:17:51] when snake bit him met Faith the three
[1:17:54] Hebrew children stay true to God's word
[1:17:56] that they would not bow their need to
[1:17:58] the king's commandment and he heated up
[1:18:00] the furnace seven times harder than it
[1:18:03] ever been heated
[1:18:04] so hot that it killed the men who threw
[1:18:07] them in there
[1:18:09] you talking about insanity
[1:18:12] they was trying to hurt the three Hebrew
[1:18:15] children and they killed their own men
[1:18:18] amen right right well let me say this
[1:18:21] the devil will destroy his own kingdom
[1:18:25] trying to stop this bride but I want the
[1:18:28] devil to know this morning he will never
[1:18:30] stop this bride
[1:18:35] amen
[1:18:37] they threw those boys in the fire and
[1:18:39] they testified our God is able to
[1:18:41] Deliver Us from this fiery furnace
[1:18:43] Shadrach Meshach Bendigo they were the
[1:18:47] Seed of Abraham and they had a promise
[1:18:49] of God that his seed would possess the
[1:18:52] enemy's Gates
[1:18:54] so they knew the king and his kingdom
[1:18:57] was not the gate possessors they were
[1:19:00] the gate possessors why because they
[1:19:02] were the Seed of Abraham and they stayed
[1:19:04] all God not on emotion not on sensation
[1:19:07] but based on the word of God I am the
[1:19:10] Seed of Abraham and I am the gate
[1:19:12] possessor amen right listen to me say to
[1:19:16] God the devil does not control the gate
[1:19:18] you do
[1:19:19] we are the Royal Seed of Abraham through
[1:19:22] Christ
[1:19:23] did the natural seed possess the gate
[1:19:25] yes they did Samson ripped up the gates
[1:19:28] backed them up on the hill threw him
[1:19:30] down said you won't you guys boys come
[1:19:31] up and get them
[1:19:33] amen thank you
[1:19:37] and they stayed with God's word
[1:19:41] they had a promise
[1:19:43] that when the Kings fiery furnace met
[1:19:47] faith
[1:19:49] Faith took the Heat
[1:19:51] and the smoke
[1:19:52] get out of the fire
[1:19:56] you see the fire was still there
[1:19:59] because when the king looked in if the
[1:20:01] fire had been gone he said hey it went
[1:20:03] out realighted but when he looked in he
[1:20:06] still saw the flames
[1:20:07] oh
[1:20:12] it's about this time we get happy at my
[1:20:13] church I'm going to try to behave
[1:20:16] think about that he took the Heat and
[1:20:19] the smoke the fire was still there amen
[1:20:22] but when the King's fire met the faith
[1:20:25] of the Hebrew children God took the Heat
[1:20:27] and the smoke out of the fire
[1:20:31] that's the God we serve he turns water
[1:20:34] into wine how many times does he have to
[1:20:37] do it before we'll believe him
[1:20:40] they're all going to God
[1:20:44] what about Daniel thrown in the Lion's
[1:20:47] Den them lines knew they had an easy
[1:20:49] meal that's a Happy Meal
[1:20:54] there's nowhere for the man to go
[1:20:58] had no doubt they had ate several men in
[1:21:00] their lifetime they had an appetite
[1:21:04] for human flesh and when they saw Daniel
[1:21:07] there they said yum yum here he comes
[1:21:11] yeah
[1:21:12] yeah
[1:21:14] think about it
[1:21:17] I thought oh my an easy this is an easy
[1:21:20] meal nowhere for him to go
[1:21:24] but when the hungry lions met faith
[1:21:28] Faith walked through Josh the prophet
[1:21:32] said the pillar of fire stood between
[1:21:33] Daniel and the Lions and the Lions went
[1:21:36] off and meowed like kittens
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:42] it went from a roar the meow meow
[1:21:52] I love having a good time
[1:21:59] a woman with a blood issue
[1:22:02] 12 years
[1:22:04] the bleeding
[1:22:06] would not stop can you imagine how
[1:22:09] nervous that would make you
[1:22:11] imagine how timid afraid to go out in
[1:22:15] public
[1:22:15] to be called unclean
[1:22:19] 12. years
[1:22:21] the bleeding would not stop spend all of
[1:22:24] her money the prophecy she sold the farm
[1:22:26] and everything
[1:22:28] but she saw Jesus
[1:22:31] and pressing through the crowd she
[1:22:34] believed that Jesus was the Christ
[1:22:38] anybody here believe that and she said
[1:22:41] if I can only Touch the Hem of His
[1:22:44] Garment
[1:22:45] she believed if she touched him she
[1:22:48] would get what she asked for and she
[1:22:50] slipped through the crowd and reached
[1:22:52] over no doubt she was smaller statue and
[1:22:54] all the people pressing in trying to
[1:22:55] touch him she couldn't get over their
[1:22:57] shoulders but was because of her statue
[1:22:59] and her timid she was got down it was
[1:23:01] reaching through their legs he said how
[1:23:04] could you say that because she touched
[1:23:05] the heel of His Garment she didn't touch
[1:23:07] his shoulder she didn't touch his back
[1:23:09] she was all the way down probably
[1:23:11] reaching between their legs
[1:23:14] and as soon as she touched him he
[1:23:17] stopped
[1:23:21] apparently can stop Jesus your faith can
[1:23:23] stop him this morning amen
[1:23:27] she slipped through the cloud she
[1:23:29] reached over and she touched me
[1:23:30] believing that she said when what
[1:23:31] happened that it would happen
[1:23:34] notice Jesus never said
[1:23:37] listen listen sis if you touch my
[1:23:40] garment you'll get well
[1:23:42] Jesus never said it Peter never said
[1:23:45] let's listen listen I'm one of his right
[1:23:47] hand men let me tell you you want to get
[1:23:49] a hold of you here's how you get a hold
[1:23:50] of you you just touch Peter never said
[1:23:53] that Jesus never said that who said if I
[1:23:57] could punch his touch His Garment she
[1:23:59] said it
[1:24:01] and she believed what she said
[1:24:04] and her words became the very word of
[1:24:07] God
[1:24:09] oh Hallelujah her words because we read
[1:24:12] her words today and her old words
[1:24:16] brought it into manifestation amen and I
[1:24:19] say do you speak to that storm speak to
[1:24:22] that habit speak to that fear
[1:24:28] Jesus never said it Peter never said it
[1:24:31] she said it
[1:24:35] in her words
[1:24:36] became his words
[1:24:44] her faith that he was the Christ
[1:24:48] brought her own words in the
[1:24:50] manifestation and when a blood issue
[1:24:53] that eluded the doctors for 12 years met
[1:24:57] faith the bleeding stopped why Faith
[1:25:01] Masters every circumstance
[1:25:06] I was in France a few years ago as a
[1:25:08] sister came to she was a Catholic came
[1:25:10] to someone invited to the service he's
[1:25:11] sitting right here with a brother
[1:25:12] sitting with the cane
[1:25:14] she speaks French I barely speak English
[1:25:18] somebody asked me one time said you
[1:25:19] speak a foreign language I said yeah
[1:25:20] English
[1:25:23] I couldn't understand her she couldn't
[1:25:25] understand me but at the end of the
[1:25:27] service I felt sorry for the woman
[1:25:29] and I just reached down and she was
[1:25:31] standing there with her hand on the cane
[1:25:32] and I just laid my hand over on her cane
[1:25:34] on her on her hand that was on the cane
[1:25:36] and I said father this poor woman's
[1:25:37] probably had a rough life probably don't
[1:25:39] understand anything that was spoke today
[1:25:41] but God in their old days just have
[1:25:43] mercy on her take her off that cane let
[1:25:45] her spend the rest of her life without
[1:25:46] the cane and I just went on and the next
[1:25:50] morning she was back in service and she
[1:25:52] said I want to testify
[1:25:55] and she stood up and she said I got up
[1:25:57] this morning and I didn't need my cane
[1:26:01] [Applause]
[1:26:03] all right
[1:26:06] and I was there in 2020 right before the
[1:26:09] pandemic broke and I was there and I saw
[1:26:11] the sister since that time she's
[1:26:13] repented of her sins been baptized in
[1:26:16] the name of Jesus Christ received the
[1:26:18] Holy Ghost she had long hair she was
[1:26:20] wearing dresses and guess what she was
[1:26:22] vacuuming the church
[1:26:25] oh God
[1:26:27] I said sis you're getting younger every
[1:26:30] time I see you you're getting younger oh
[1:26:32] listen to me little brother when I get
[1:26:34] older we're getting younger
[1:26:37] yeah
[1:26:38] Hallelujah
[1:26:43] I think of Joshua God told him Joshua I
[1:26:47] want you to March around the walls of
[1:26:49] Jericho and they'll fall before you
[1:26:54] now these walls they say that they could
[1:26:57] run chariot races on the top of these
[1:26:59] walls if I remember right rahab's House
[1:27:03] was built on top of the war
[1:27:07] some historians say they were 46 foot
[1:27:11] high and 80 foot thick
[1:27:14] man and God said Joshua I want you to go
[1:27:17] up there March around so many times
[1:27:19] sound the trumpet let out a shout and
[1:27:23] the walls are going to fall down
[1:27:31] assertion should I bring a Wrecking Bar
[1:27:33] nope
[1:27:34] backhoe nope bulldozer
[1:27:37] case of dynamite
[1:27:41] just go up there March around blow a
[1:27:44] trumpet
[1:27:45] and Shout
[1:27:47] and the walls are going to fall down
[1:27:51] just obey my word
[1:27:55] so silly
[1:27:57] carnal mind
[1:27:58] people even get quiet when you talk
[1:28:00] about it and it's in the Bible
[1:28:03] 46 foot high 80 foot thick
[1:28:07] and I found this I thought it was so
[1:28:09] good the prophet said Joshua knowing how
[1:28:11] thick those walls was because he built
[1:28:14] plenty of them down in Egypt he knew the
[1:28:16] cement that was in them how tight they
[1:28:18] were to hold them together giant races
[1:28:21] on top of them even built houses on top
[1:28:23] of them and Jocelyn knew all of this
[1:28:25] from an intellectual understanding
[1:28:28] but Joshua did not lead to his own
[1:28:31] understanding he believed what God Said
[1:28:33] was the truth and he obeyed his word
[1:28:37] and the walls fell down leaning not to
[1:28:41] his own understanding Joshua looked at
[1:28:43] the Unseen and he walked around the
[1:28:44] walls believing it would happen
[1:28:47] you see it all depends on what you're
[1:28:49] looking at but we don't look with the
[1:28:50] eyes of our head we look with the eyes
[1:28:52] of our heart
[1:28:53] and with 46 High
[1:28:57] 46 foot high walls
[1:29:00] met faith
[1:29:02] the walls
[1:29:04] came down
[1:29:05] jairus's daughter lay dead the mourners
[1:29:08] gathered to mourning they said trouble
[1:29:10] not the master anymore
[1:29:12] your little girl
[1:29:14] is dead
[1:29:16] oh that's such a that's such a solid
[1:29:19] word when you hear that word dead just
[1:29:24] but you see
[1:29:26] Jesus gave Jairus the remedy
[1:29:29] Jesus gave Jairus the remedy to every
[1:29:33] bad report
[1:29:34] all right
[1:29:36] he touched Jairus on the on the shoulder
[1:29:39] and he said two words
[1:29:42] only
[1:29:43] believe
[1:29:47] that's all he ever asked us to do
[1:29:51] not to figure it out not to reason it
[1:29:53] out not to even work it out
[1:29:55] just believe
[1:29:57] only
[1:29:58] belief
[1:30:01] Jesus standing at the grave of Lazarus a
[1:30:03] man that had been dead for days
[1:30:05] corruption had done set in even his
[1:30:08] sister said Lord
[1:30:09] he stinks
[1:30:12] but when a dead man oh God
[1:30:15] man a man who had faith in what the word
[1:30:17] said he was the prophet of God said
[1:30:20] Jesus had perfect Faith because he
[1:30:23] believed in what the word said that he
[1:30:25] was can you believe this morning and
[1:30:27] what the word says you are
[1:30:31] we are not a denomination we are not an
[1:30:34] organization
[1:30:35] we are not just a church member body but
[1:30:38] we are the body of Jesus Christ
[1:30:40] manifested on the earth thought of his
[1:30:42] bones flesh of his flesh Spirit of his
[1:30:44] spirit
[1:30:48] the prophet said she is human
[1:30:56] when a dead man
[1:30:58] met a man who had faith in what the word
[1:31:00] said he was and Jesus cried up Lazarus
[1:31:03] come forth
[1:31:05] man that had been dead four days stood
[1:31:07] on his feet
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:10] when death
[1:31:11] met Faith the maniac of good ERA let me
[1:31:14] hurry the maniac of gadera the Demons
[1:31:17] had him bound
[1:31:19] the Bible said he lived among the tombs
[1:31:21] and he cut himself with stones still
[1:31:23] have them today
[1:31:26] cutters
[1:31:29] but God is the remedy for cutters
[1:31:32] I was in the meeting a few years ago
[1:31:34] down to byc camp in Louisiana there's a
[1:31:36] sister down there that was a cutter she
[1:31:38] had all these scars up and down her arms
[1:31:40] where she'd cut herself and in this
[1:31:41] particular I believe it was the sunrise
[1:31:43] service if I remember right but in this
[1:31:45] particular service the people was
[1:31:46] praising the Lord and the sister said
[1:31:48] Lord I Want To Praise you so much I want
[1:31:49] to raise my hands to you so much but
[1:31:51] I've got these scars and I'm a shame
[1:31:53] devil and she said a boy spoke to her
[1:31:55] and said raise your arms and give me
[1:31:57] praise and when that sister raised her
[1:31:58] arms the scars disappeared off of her
[1:32:01] arms
[1:32:02] oh Hallelujah your back's against the
[1:32:06] wall praise His name when you feel you
[1:32:08] can't go out just lift your hands and
[1:32:10] say glad you receive that is in me then
[1:32:13] he that's in the world and you can
[1:32:14] praise your heart away
[1:32:24] cut himself with stones they tried to
[1:32:27] chain him and tame him
[1:32:30] but he'd break the chains and feathers
[1:32:32] and no man could tame him they tried to
[1:32:35] make him a good message believer giving
[1:32:37] him a few books and a picture of the
[1:32:39] pillar of Fire
[1:32:40] but you see our young people need a
[1:32:42] birth
[1:32:45] that token must be applied I don't care
[1:32:47] if you're eight or eighty right
[1:32:49] come on somebody
[1:32:51] we're not going because we believe God
[1:32:52] sent a prophet the devil believes that
[1:32:54] we're going because the token has been
[1:32:56] applied and he said when I see the blood
[1:32:59] I will pass over you
[1:33:02] you think you don't need this you need
[1:33:03] this young man
[1:33:06] Satan's just waiting to cut your throat
[1:33:08] out there
[1:33:09] you better listen to me
[1:33:10] right you better hide beneath the blood
[1:33:15] America's seen this better days
[1:33:17] Prophet said it's going to get gradually
[1:33:19] no he said not gradually but quickly get
[1:33:21] worse and worse and worse
[1:33:24] you know I read a study the other day
[1:33:26] they said that Darkness you place
[1:33:29] somebody in darkness and isolation it
[1:33:31] leads to Total Insanity and you take the
[1:33:35] darkness of laodicea
[1:33:37] and the oscillation of the pandemic
[1:33:40] and that's why they're killing each
[1:33:42] other on the streets right now
[1:33:44] and did not our prophet of God say it
[1:33:46] will come to pass that they will go
[1:33:48] totally insane
[1:33:56] it's crazy
[1:33:58] when a man thinks he's a woman and wins
[1:34:00] the swim meet
[1:34:02] and they give him a trophy
[1:34:06] they should give him shock treatments
[1:34:08] come on somebody that's insane
[1:34:13] when a man wins what Miss Universe
[1:34:15] because he's dressed like a woman and
[1:34:17] they go along with it it reminds me when
[1:34:19] I was a little boy and reread what was
[1:34:21] that book The Emperor's New Clothes
[1:34:22] anybody remember that he was going down
[1:34:25] the street naked and everybody oh
[1:34:26] brother clothes they're beautiful and
[1:34:28] somebody said are you crazy ain't got no
[1:34:29] clothes on
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:33] they have lost their minds
[1:34:37] and if you go along with it you need
[1:34:39] help I'm sorry
[1:34:43] amen
[1:34:44] well that's not politically correct I
[1:34:47] ain't interested in being politically
[1:34:48] correct honey all right that's the least
[1:34:50] of my worries
[1:34:51] come on somebody
[1:34:55] well they'll shut you up they'll never
[1:34:57] shut us up the prophet said God will
[1:34:58] take us up
[1:35:03] amen what did Jesus say you shall know
[1:35:05] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:35:08] free
[1:35:09] but anyway this man let me hurry this
[1:35:11] man he was demon-possessed living among
[1:35:13] the tombs cutting himself day and night
[1:35:15] and no man could tame him until they
[1:35:17] tried to tame him they tried to change
[1:35:19] him they tried to make him a part of
[1:35:20] society but he would do good for a while
[1:35:22] and then that would come back upon him
[1:35:24] and he'd rip off the chains and rip off
[1:35:26] his clothes and go back and live among
[1:35:27] the dead but what man could not do Faith
[1:35:30] could do
[1:35:32] what brought Jesus to the gallerias it
[1:35:35] wasn't the mayor the mayor never asked
[1:35:37] him to come it wasn't the organization
[1:35:39] that invited him it wasn't the pig
[1:35:41] Farmers that asked him to come they
[1:35:42] asked him to leave what brought him to
[1:35:45] the what brought him to the galleries it
[1:35:48] was the maniac who was living among the
[1:35:50] tombs cutting his flesh ripping off his
[1:35:52] clothes but he wanted help
[1:35:56] at the needy Soul was crying out for
[1:35:58] deliverance and Jesus on the other side
[1:36:00] of the sea heard his invite of faith and
[1:36:04] Jesus crossed the stormy sea to get to
[1:36:07] that one Soul crying out for help and
[1:36:10] he's the same Jesus this morning he'll
[1:36:13] come from glory for one needy soul in
[1:36:15] this building
[1:36:18] he'll come every time where he's wanted
[1:36:22] he'll come every time or he's wanted you
[1:36:25] need to put that on your refrigerator
[1:36:26] he'll come every time where he's wanted
[1:36:29] but he'll never come to where he's
[1:36:32] doubted
[1:36:36] well I don't know if he can help me
[1:36:37] don't worry
[1:36:39] that doubt will keep him away
[1:36:43] if you're doubting him just remember if
[1:36:45] you're doubting him just remember he
[1:36:48] will never be at your door
[1:36:51] all right
[1:36:52] so don't doubt
[1:36:55] just believe
[1:36:57] well the doctor said mine's the worst
[1:36:59] case he ever saw it's just a greater
[1:37:00] miracle
[1:37:03] Lord
[1:37:07] but if you love him and you want him
[1:37:09] he'll come any time that you call for
[1:37:12] him to come he's ready to come then that
[1:37:15] tells me right now in Lula Georgia he is
[1:37:18] ready to meet every need that's in this
[1:37:21] building this morning
[1:37:23] he don't want our money come on somebody
[1:37:25] he never asked for our money what he did
[1:37:27] ask us to believe him if those can't
[1:37:30] believe all things are possible
[1:37:34] you heard his Cry of faith and if you
[1:37:36] heard his Cry of Faith he'll hear your
[1:37:37] cry Faith you see that great storm could
[1:37:40] not stop Jesus from coming it could not
[1:37:43] drowned out that cry faith and let me
[1:37:45] say there is nothing that Satan has that
[1:37:48] can stop Faith from touching Jesus
[1:37:54] touching Jesus is all that really
[1:37:57] matters
[1:38:00] you know you feel sorry for some people
[1:38:01] they built so many walls around their
[1:38:03] life
[1:38:05] and they won't let him in
[1:38:09] oh won't you tear the walls down friends
[1:38:14] touching Jesus is all that really
[1:38:16] matters then your life will never be the
[1:38:19] same there's only one way that you can
[1:38:22] touch him You Must Believe when you call
[1:38:25] on his name
[1:38:27] listen to all her When Faith Cometh From
[1:38:30] an honest heart When Faith from an
[1:38:32] honest heart meets God them cogs just
[1:38:34] comes together like that and something
[1:38:36] has to take place I challenge this
[1:38:38] audience in the name of Jesus Christ let
[1:38:42] your faith connect with God like that
[1:38:44] and in a few minutes we'll have another
[1:38:46] Pentecost there'll be such a Revival
[1:38:48] breakout in this town that there won't
[1:38:50] be enough cops in the country to keep
[1:38:52] them down that's right there will be a
[1:38:54] real Revival when your faith meets him
[1:38:57] Hallelujah
[1:39:02] so listen you young people listen to
[1:39:05] this right here you don't go to hell
[1:39:07] because you're a sinner
[1:39:12] you go to hell because you refuse to
[1:39:15] accept the way away from hell
[1:39:18] there's a bypass and that's Christ
[1:39:20] there's a bypass from your sickness from
[1:39:23] a quick death from a premature grave and
[1:39:26] that's through Christ now you said to me
[1:39:29] being the beginning you sinned in the
[1:39:31] beginning and Christ died for your sins
[1:39:36] therefore he saved you when he died he
[1:39:40] saved you and he healed you when he died
[1:39:43] for he took your place now all you have
[1:39:48] to do is accept it by faith and receive
[1:39:51] it
[1:39:52] because there's nothing more to be done
[1:39:55] your healing is already paid for
[1:40:00] that oh can I tell it again
[1:40:04] I was in a restaurant here the other day
[1:40:06] and the waitress coming she said now
[1:40:08] y'all want anything else I said no ma'am
[1:40:10] we're fine we could just have the check
[1:40:13] and she said well somebody saw you in
[1:40:15] here
[1:40:17] and they paid for your meal it's already
[1:40:18] paid for
[1:40:20] I said well let me leave a tip no they
[1:40:21] left the tip too it's all took care of
[1:40:26] now I had one or two things
[1:40:28] I could have sat there and argued with
[1:40:30] her
[1:40:31] I said no I I don't see nobody here that
[1:40:33] I know you sure you've got the right
[1:40:35] table I don't want to walk out of here
[1:40:37] man here come the cops
[1:40:42] I could have argued with her
[1:40:44] I could have no no there ain't no way no
[1:40:46] I want to pay for it I want to make sure
[1:40:47] it's paid for
[1:40:49] it or I could have accepted it yeah
[1:40:53] and so you know what I said
[1:40:55] I said I received that thank you whoever
[1:40:57] done that thank you to this day I still
[1:41:00] don't know who done it but in your case
[1:41:02] you know who done it
[1:41:04] Jesus Christ did it for you and if you
[1:41:07] was the only person in Lula Georgia the
[1:41:09] only young person he would have went to
[1:41:11] Calgary for you if he was the only
[1:41:13] person ever sick he would have took
[1:41:15] every stripe on this back for your
[1:41:17] healing that's how much he loves you
[1:41:20] yeah sometimes it's so hard for us to
[1:41:23] accept love
[1:41:25] all right but I want you to understand
[1:41:27] man's love may be conditional you do
[1:41:29] this I'll do that but that's not the way

[1:42:33] about a month or so later John would get
[1:42:36] the letter he didn't answer it and
[1:42:38] they'd ride a horse to death and ride a
[1:42:39] horse to death and ride a horse to death
[1:42:41] and he'd get the answer to his letter in
[1:42:43] John say doing pretty good
[1:42:46] right but now we live in an age when we
[1:42:49] send a text if it don't go through

[1:43:01] I'm not going to ask who's guilty but I

[1:43:08] way
[1:43:10] Congressman Upshaw fell and broke his
[1:43:13] back as an 18 year old boy
[1:43:15] 62 years later
[1:43:18] he'd come out of a wheelchair
[1:43:29] it don't matter when it happens
[1:43:31] circumstances don't matter just be found
[1:43:34] believe it oh
[1:43:37] I was in Romania there's a young girl
[1:43:39] came up she's a gypsy girl and she was
[1:43:42] born without a help and when she walked
[1:43:44] her leg just swung like this she's on a
[1:43:45] crutch and when she stopped walking
[1:43:47] she'd have to stop her leg from swinging
[1:43:49] and she'd come up on a Friday night
[1:43:51] Kenny Capps had the morning service I
[1:43:52] had the night services and she come up
[1:43:54] on a Friday night and she wanted to
[1:43:55] repent of her sins and she worked that
[1:43:58] leg to get down her knees I said sis I
[1:44:01] said you don't have to do that you could
[1:44:02] stand right there and accept Christ as
[1:44:04] your savior but she wanted to get down
[1:44:06] on her knees and she worked that leg
[1:44:08] till she got down and I thought how many
[1:44:10] people have two good legs and never
[1:44:12] bowed before God all right buddy come on
[1:44:15] she'll condemn a bunch of them
[1:44:18] and she repented of her sins the next
[1:44:21] day she went out on a Saturday morning
[1:44:22] after the service in an icy River with
[1:44:25] that crutch and was baptized in the name
[1:44:27] of Jesus Christ she came back to the
[1:44:29] altar that night and she said I want God
[1:44:31] to heal me

[1:44:35] I want to have children she said who
[1:44:37] would marry me like this

[1:44:41] do if I was you I quit asking God for my
[1:44:44] healing and I'd start thanking him for

[1:44:55] for healing you when you go to bed at
[1:44:56] night you thank God for healing you and
[1:44:58] I said when God heals your heel you take
[1:45:01] this handkerchief you put it under your
[1:45:02] pillar and when God heals your hip send
[1:45:05] it back to me as a testimony of what he

[1:49:16] drop this here I want to drop this in
[1:49:18] and we'll close right here I want to
[1:49:20] look at hope versus faith okay
[1:49:24] now listen to this this is amazing this
[1:49:27] is a quote it's not my words this is a
[1:49:28] quote
[1:49:29] hope versus Faith now hope will agree
[1:49:32] with the Bible
[1:49:35] hope will say it's true
[1:49:37] hope will say I believe every bit of it
[1:49:41] hope will say I believe it's God's word
[1:49:44] hope will say I believe God keeps his
[1:49:46] promise hope believes all that
[1:49:49] but then hope says now I believe God
[1:49:53] will heal
[1:49:54] but look at my condition
[1:50:00] now friends
[1:50:02] we all believe God's A Healer
[1:50:04] amen amen we all believe God keeps his
[1:50:07] word
[1:50:09] and Satan will come to us say yeah God
[1:50:11] heals cancer
[1:50:13] but yours is the worst case the doctors
[1:50:15] ever saw
[1:50:18] and Hope
[1:50:19] we'll look to that
[1:50:24] hope will say God is my healer but the
[1:50:27] devil says yeah God heals but he's not
[1:50:29] going to heal you
[1:50:33] that's what hope does
[1:50:35] hope looks at the condition
[1:50:39] but faith
[1:50:41] Faith don't look at that faith comes
[1:50:44] around and says I don't care nothing
[1:50:45] about conditions God said so in its mind
[1:50:48] you see faith is Burly as I once said
[1:50:51] faith has hair on its chest and when it
[1:50:54] stands up and pulls out its big muscles
[1:50:55] everything vanishes away
[1:50:58] When Faith takes a hold when you believe
[1:51:01] it and take God in his word and say it
[1:51:03] so amen I believe it's so God will bring
[1:51:07] it to pass
[1:51:10] when you're out from under Superstition
[1:51:13] when you're out from under Babylon when
[1:51:15] you're out from under unbelief when
[1:51:16] you're out from under all these things
[1:51:18] and you are filled with God's own life
[1:51:20] your voice is his voice you are I've
[1:51:24] spoken yes sir yeah right Hallelujah
[1:51:28] Hallelujah
[1:51:30] Jesus promised he would heal us if you
[1:51:31] ask anything in my name I'll do it when
[1:51:33] you pray believe that you receive what
[1:51:35] you asked for and you shall have it it's
[1:51:37] yours believe it'll come to pass the
[1:51:39] time don't matter the circumstance don't

[2:20:17] was gonna come up here and tell brother
[2:20:20] Darryl let everybody lay hands on each
[2:20:21] other we'd have a prayer and then when
[2:20:24] he said that I said Lord that's just
[2:20:28] like it was it's a tabernacle I could
[2:20:29] hear Brother Branham say you know today
[2:20:31] just reach over and take somebody by the
[2:20:34] hand or reach over and touch it so we're
[2:20:36] going to see something great today
[2:20:38] you know what God spoke to me and he
[2:20:40] said I'm the same here as I was there
[2:20:44] [Music]
[2:20:46] he's the same here we love to Revel in
[2:20:50] the days of brother Branham and listen
[2:20:52] to the prayer lines what about today
[2:20:54] right what about right now same God same
[2:20:58] atmosphere same people the bride they
[2:21:02] were bright back there the bride here
[2:21:03] amen God bless you good to have each and
[2:21:06] every one of you here good to be in the
[2:21:08] house of the Lord see what you miss when
[2:21:10] you don't come to church this is good I
[2:21:12] like this you know you miss a lot but
[2:21:16] you know what you miss you miss
[2:21:17] fellowshipping with God right because he
[2:21:20] just dropped down after we did after we
[2:21:22] laid hands on each other he just he just
[2:21:24] he just dropped and you could see the
[2:21:26] virtue go out of that man you see him he
[2:21:29] poured his heart out man he ain't got
[2:21:32] nothing left and that's okay you know my
[2:21:35] football coach he said we might get beat
[2:21:37] 16 to nothing he said but if I have to
[2:21:39] drag you off the field and you look up
[2:21:40] at me and said I did my best he said
[2:21:42] that's all I want to hear that's right
[2:21:44] so today brother Daryl did his best
[2:21:47] and you did your best by pulling on the
[2:21:49] gift
[2:21:50] and I believe we're going to see a lot
[2:21:55] that's why we bring ministers then
[2:21:56] that's why we have special meetings it's
[2:21:59] not for
[2:22:00] brother Daryl or myself is for you it's
[2:22:03] for you to get something for you to get
[2:22:05] something fresh from God Amen and if
[2:22:07] you'll be seated just for a few minutes
[2:22:09] what sister Bella wants to give her
[2:22:10] testimony just for a little bit and uh
[2:22:13] before we dismiss and everybody's got
[2:22:16] something to something to give so we our
[2:22:19] sister's going to give us a
[2:22:22] this one
[2:22:23] this one okay all right okay
[2:22:28] I'll just make it quick but
[2:22:31] um
[2:22:32] pretty much when we came back from
[2:22:33] Nicaragua it felt like really any other
[2:22:36] trip that I've gone to because
[2:22:38] you know I grew up with with missionary
[2:22:40] parents and and so it's nothing whenever
[2:22:43] you go usually you just expect the same
[2:22:46] mundane thing my dad goes and preaches
[2:22:48] it's super hot and then
[2:22:50] it's just a lot of rice and beans it's
[2:22:52] just a very mundane thing for me because
[2:22:53] I've just been doing it for so long
[2:22:55] right and
[2:22:57] um you know I was able to take Nyla
[2:22:58] Michael and Jordan with me and it was
[2:23:00] super great loved it but the entire Camp
[2:23:03] nothing really happened
[2:23:05] in terms of me being able to bring
[2:23:08] something back and in my mind that
[2:23:10] wasn't that big of a deal because I
[2:23:12] wasn't expecting to say anything anyway
[2:23:15] but
[2:23:16] um then brother Wade asked me to say
[2:23:18] something and then I was like I don't
[2:23:20] know what I'm gonna say because nothing
[2:23:22] happened this time and so when we got
[2:23:24] back home you know I made some new
[2:23:27] friends so you know they all found me on
[2:23:29] Instagram they all wanted my number
[2:23:31] so you know we were texting back and
[2:23:34] forth I was texting one of my friends
[2:23:35] and we were just talking and she started
[2:23:39] telling me about
[2:23:41] what had happened to her a year ago and
[2:23:44] she said that she had had this 10 plus
[2:23:47] year relationship with these two girls
[2:23:50] and she said that jealousy and envy got
[2:23:53] in between their relationship and it
[2:23:56] completely broke everything off
[2:23:58] and so pretty much what happened was she
[2:24:01] got super backstabbed a bunch of times
[2:24:03] and she ended up falling into depression
[2:24:07] and anxiety she got diagnosed she was
[2:24:09] taking meds for it and during that
[2:24:11] entire time she was having to take
[2:24:13] medication for it and
[2:24:16] um
[2:24:17] she lost a bunch of weight because of it
[2:24:19] and I had seen her at the camps but I
[2:24:22] didn't really talk to her but she found
[2:24:25] me and so we were just we were just
[2:24:26] texting back and forth and she said
[2:24:30] um yeah I just lost a bunch of weight
[2:24:32] and I feel terrible because I can't gain
[2:24:34] that weight back
[2:24:36] and as soon as she said that it clicked
[2:24:38] to me that reminded me exactly of my mom
[2:24:40] because my mom all of her life has been
[2:24:43] super skinny and all of you know that
[2:24:45] she's just she's that's just her makeup
[2:24:47] and she when she was growing up she
[2:24:50] would cry about it because it was
[2:24:51] something so sensitive to her that she
[2:24:53] couldn't control
[2:24:54] and so I started telling her about my
[2:24:57] mom and then she was telling me but your
[2:25:00] mom's so beautiful your mom's so
[2:25:02] talented
[2:25:03] and in my head my I've always seen my
[2:25:05] mom as normal looking but I know that
[2:25:07] she's skinny I know she's not like
[2:25:11] she's not exactly this skinny that
[2:25:12] everyone else sees but I've always seen
[2:25:14] her as very normal because I grew up
[2:25:16] with her and so this sister her name is
[2:25:18] ISA she was telling me but your mom's so
[2:25:21] beautiful she walks around with so much
[2:25:22] confidence and she's so tall and the
[2:25:25] sisters in Nicaragua are super short
[2:25:27] okay so she's like she's so tall she's
[2:25:31] so light-skinned she's so pretty I'm all
[2:25:34] dark I'm super short
[2:25:36] um my hair is not that thick I'm super
[2:25:39] skinny I'm skin and bone
[2:25:41] I don't play any instruments I don't
[2:25:43] sing and I just started telling her
[2:25:45] about my mom and she I could feel that
[2:25:48] her faith was building up from the other
[2:25:50] side of the screen
[2:25:54] I haven't talked to her in a few days
[2:25:57] but her brother has told me that she's
[2:26:00] been singing her heart out
[2:26:04] that she hasn't stopped smiling
[2:26:08] and I didn't expect anything to happen
[2:26:11] after after Nicaragua yeah
[2:26:14] I really just thought that I'm just a
[2:26:16] Minister's daughter that's it
[2:26:19] and so that's just all I had to say and
[2:26:22] I didn't even think I was gonna cry but
[2:26:25] she's such close friends to me
[2:26:27] I don't have an older sister she's 20.
[2:26:30] and so my relationship with her has just
[2:26:33] grown so close
[2:26:35] and I'm just so proud of her and what
[2:26:38] she's able to do now it's only been a
[2:26:40] couple of days since I told her that but
[2:26:42] she's apparently improving so much in
[2:26:46] her self-confidence and everything else
[2:26:48] so
[2:26:49] I just want you guys to keep her in
[2:26:51] prayer because she deserves the absolute
[2:26:54] best okay
[2:26:55] her name is sister I said she's 20 years
[2:26:57] old she lives in shenandega so an
[2:26:59] escaper in your prayers okay
[2:27:02] [Music]
[2:27:09] well you don't think anything's
[2:27:11] happening don't worry something's
[2:27:14] happening let's stand to our feet
[2:27:17] anybody have anything else we've we've

[2:27:56] hey man um I actually I was I was gonna
[2:27:59] give this testimony earlier but um I
[2:28:01] didn't have time and I was asking um
[2:28:03] brother um brother
[2:28:07] thank you brother Terry but um it was
[2:28:09] too late so I figured I said well Lord
[2:28:11] if you want me to give this testimony
[2:28:12] let at the end of the service let him
[2:28:15] let somebody speak up and say does
[2:28:17] anybody else got something to say so
[2:28:18] that that's right there thank you
[2:28:20] um
[2:28:22] this is um
[2:28:23] I know we know the story of the prodigal
[2:28:25] son and I have a testimony of I wanted
[2:28:30] similar but it's the prodigal daughter
[2:28:31] and it got to do with me and my mother
[2:28:34] um we grew up in the message
[2:28:37] so growing up in the message we would go
[2:28:39] to tape services and we would visit
[2:28:41] other churches and it was just normal to
[2:28:44] me it was normal it was the norm it
[2:28:45] wasn't nothing
[2:28:47] um unusual
[2:28:49] so
[2:28:50] so
[2:28:51] um as I was growing up though it wasn't
[2:28:53] like I was exactly knowing what was
[2:28:55] going on it was just kind of like it's
[2:28:56] just something you do you get up and go
[2:28:57] to church and that's it we know about my
[2:29:00] mom testimonies and stuff and my dad
[2:29:02] also was a believer
[2:29:04] so it was normal so um as I got older
[2:29:09] I I drifted away
[2:29:11] so I wasn't um as I see some of you
[2:29:13] young people you sticking in church
[2:29:15] you're doing good I was I drifted away
[2:29:18] my family broke up and everything so it
[2:29:20] was already in a broken situation
[2:29:22] so when your family's not together you
[2:29:25] all you you kind of just
[2:29:27] you kind of just
[2:29:28] you know you just kind of like hey okay
[2:29:30] I'm free I didn't have nobody kind of um
[2:29:33] supervising me too much when we got up
[2:29:35] there we just was free we lived in a
[2:29:37] neighborhood full of kids so we would
[2:29:39] just go hang out and have fun
[2:29:40] but anyway as I turned into a teenager
[2:29:43] um like I said I took some path that I'm
[2:29:46] not too proud of
[2:29:47] and I was staying with my mom at the
[2:29:49] time
[2:29:50] um I was 14 I was staying with my mother
[2:29:52] and I started being really rebellious
[2:29:54] really rebellious skipping school I
[2:29:57] didn't like the situation I was in
[2:29:58] living with her and um she was a good
[2:30:01] mom but at the time my stepdad I wasn't
[2:30:03] used to him he was really strict and my
[2:30:06] my biological father wasn't so when this
[2:30:08] my stepdadders around now he's telling
[2:30:10] me what to do and you need to watch her
[2:30:12] at school go check on her school I was
[2:30:13] like man what is this this is just my
[2:30:16] life is ruined you know because my dad
[2:30:17] never was like that my real dad so
[2:30:20] anyway that started changing my mother
[2:30:22] attitude because he's getting on her to
[2:30:24] get on me and um I started getting
[2:30:26] rebellious to her because now she's
[2:30:28] becoming a new person
[2:30:30] so um I started getting really out of
[2:30:32] hand skipping school and everything so
[2:30:33] finally they came to me one day and was
[2:30:35] like look we're going to give you a
[2:30:36] decision to make either you abide by the
[2:30:39] rules or you go move with dad my dad so
[2:30:42] to me that sound like the golden like
[2:30:44] thank you this is exactly what I wanted
[2:30:47] to hear
[2:30:49] this is like the golden voice I wanted
[2:30:52] to hear so I I jumped on that I was like
[2:30:54] I want to go stay with Dad because I
[2:30:56] knew my dad wasn't going to be
[2:30:57] monitoring me and at that age you feel
[2:30:59] like man this is the beginning of Life
[2:31:01] you know
[2:31:02] and uh
[2:31:04] I went to go live with my dad
[2:31:06] but that was the beginning of Hell Gates
[2:31:09] opening up for me as well and uh I end
[2:31:12] up stealing my older sister's ID she was
[2:31:15] six years older than me I stole her ID
[2:31:17] ended up getting a permit with her age
[2:31:20] on it but my face on the picture so I'm
[2:31:23] I'm 20. so I can go anywhere in Atlanta
[2:31:25] and that's exactly what I did when I ran
[2:31:28] all over Atlanta different clubs and
[2:31:30] doing all these things and one day I got
[2:31:34] caught up really started getting darker
[2:31:36] and darker like when when you start
[2:31:37] entering into sin it take you further
[2:31:40] than you thought you was going to go
[2:31:41] because it's enticing at first and it's
[2:31:43] like wow I can do all these things and
[2:31:46] Satan is just telling you exactly what
[2:31:48] to do how to do it how to sneak around
[2:31:50] and do it but he don't tell you how deep
[2:31:52] you about to take you and he took me
[2:31:54] really really deep really deep where I'm
[2:31:57] not going to say a lot of things but use
[2:31:59] your imagination so I started working at
[2:32:02] an adult Club
[2:32:04] um at 14. okay and uh
[2:32:08] like I said it got really deep and dark
[2:32:10] I started uh isolating myself from my
[2:32:13] parents my brothers and sisters they was
[2:32:15] already in college and kind of on their
[2:32:16] own so it was just me I didn't have
[2:32:19] nobody to answer to nobody was
[2:32:20] monitoring over me so
[2:32:22] um I just started isolating myself I
[2:32:25] didn't keep in touch with my family at
[2:32:26] this time my dad was going through his
[2:32:28] own thing so I was on my own I moved out
[2:32:29] from him
[2:32:30] was living in a place by myself like a
[2:32:32] rooming house so we had like different
[2:32:34] roommates and stuff so my mom had no
[2:32:36] idea where I was at this was over a
[2:32:38] period of two years
[2:32:40] so um I was 16 now
[2:32:42] so one day I let her tell this part oh
[2:32:46] one day
[2:32:47] um when I was getting ready to go to
[2:32:48] work that day at this the place I was
[2:32:51] working at a club
[2:32:53] I that night I'm sorry I left my key
[2:32:56] inside of the club so when I when I took
[2:32:58] a cab home I realized I didn't have my
[2:33:00] house key I couldn't get in
[2:33:01] so I went back to the spot I was working
[2:33:04] at but it was already closed so I had to
[2:33:05] make a decision to go stay at the hotel
[2:33:07] that was close by and I just figured
[2:33:09] okay I'll just get up in the morning and
[2:33:12] go to work I don't usually work in the
[2:33:14] morning I usually work at night
[2:33:16] so uh that morning I woke up went to the
[2:33:19] um went back to the club went back there
[2:33:21] and got sat down and ate and everything
[2:33:23] somebody came back there and said um
[2:33:25] somebody here to see you a lady
[2:33:28] and uh I'm like a lady you know in that
[2:33:30] lifestyle you used to a man coming to
[2:33:33] see you so when I hear a lady here to
[2:33:34] see you I'm like what
[2:33:36] so I come out and from where I'm at I
[2:33:39] looked down probably like the same
[2:33:40] distance of the double doors I looked at
[2:33:42] and I see like a small image of a lady
[2:33:44] that's shaped like my mother and Lord
[2:33:47] holds no that's my mom is at the spot
[2:33:50] where I'm at and I'm super shocked
[2:33:52] because she didn't know where I was at
[2:33:54] and I'll let her tell the part that yeah
[2:33:56] how she got there well when I couldn't
[2:33:58] find Rebecca I was just praying all the
[2:34:00] time all every day I didn't know where
[2:34:01] to find her I don't know what happened
[2:34:03] to her and I know one day I was walking
[2:34:05] home from the bus and someone pulled
[2:34:09] over
[2:34:09] a person a young man want to give me a
[2:34:12] ride oh I knew the man so I said yeah I
[2:34:16] didn't say you know Rebecca you know
[2:34:18] where Rebecca is I said no he said I'm
[2:34:20] gonna tell you something I don't want to
[2:34:21] let her know I told you I'ma tell you
[2:34:23] exactly where she at she working at the
[2:34:25] club at such and such a place he said
[2:34:27] don't never ever tell her I was so happy
[2:34:29] he told me now I know to go where to
[2:34:31] find her now so I didn't go to those
[2:34:34] places I don't want nobody to see me
[2:34:36] that know me see me step in a place like
[2:34:38] that so when I went to the door now I
[2:34:40] asked him you know I see some young lady
[2:34:43] was going inside I accepted no Rebecca
[2:34:45] they said no we don't know who's Rebecca
[2:34:48] I said well that's my daughter you know
[2:34:51] they said well that's a real name I say
[2:34:54] yeah
[2:34:55] they said no in this place here we don't
[2:34:58] use their real name and she said she
[2:35:01] will she go and find what she's got he's
[2:35:03] a young girl working here now I bet
[2:35:05] that's her she's going to find her so
[2:35:08] she went by there yeah so they came back
[2:35:10] there and got me and like I said I look
[2:35:11] and see an image of a lady that's shaped
[2:35:13] like my mother and I'm super shot
[2:35:16] but something in me was also happy like
[2:35:18] it was like I needed it and didn't know
[2:35:21] I needed to see her I didn't know I I
[2:35:24] needed to see her so bad because I I was
[2:35:26] sick I was sick you guys and I didn't
[2:35:29] know how sick I was but I know I didn't
[2:35:31] know how to get out of it I didn't know
[2:35:33] how to get out of that grip and I was I
[2:35:35] was I was so gone and so wasted away
[2:35:38] with the alcohol and the drugs and just
[2:35:40] everything you know so when I saw her it
[2:35:43] was like I needed it so bad
[2:35:45] and um the the best part is she didn't
[2:35:49] judge me she didn't come and say what
[2:35:50] you doing here get out of here it was
[2:35:52] like she had she was so happy to see me
[2:35:54] I left that club I left out of there and
[2:35:57] we went back to the place I was staying
[2:35:59] at
[2:35:59] and she just lumped on me and I needed
[2:36:02] it so much I didn't need nobody telling
[2:36:03] me how wrong I was I was already I knew
[2:36:06] I was messed up so sometimes you don't
[2:36:07] even need somebody to tell you how
[2:36:09] messed up you were you just need that
[2:36:11] genuine unconditional love and that's
[2:36:13] what God put on her and um little by
[2:36:15] little we started hanging out more and
[2:36:17] more and um
[2:36:19] I started us my sister older sister told
[2:36:21] me about um signing up for school
[2:36:23] because I was still young she's like why
[2:36:25] don't you just go back to school you
[2:36:26] know go to this place called Job Corps
[2:36:28] so um I went ahead and signed up and I
[2:36:32] was you still kind of playing tug of war
[2:36:34] because you like you so caught up in
[2:36:35] this lifestyle but yet you know you got
[2:36:36] to get out you know you know you want to
[2:36:38] get out and uh they called me in three
[2:36:41] days I'm like look pack your stuff we
[2:36:42] got a ticket you're getting out of here
[2:36:43] in three days and I signed up to go to
[2:36:45] Kentucky uh School in Kentucky that was
[2:36:48] my exit out of there and I never went
[2:36:50] back I ended up getting married later
[2:36:51] not too long after that and everything
[2:36:53] that's another story but anyway my point
[2:36:55] is
[2:36:57] God used my mom like the prodigal son
[2:36:59] and she didn't judge me man I tell her
[2:37:01] up to this day just thank you so much
[2:37:03] for just having that genuine love that I
[2:37:05] needed that Unconditional Love sometimes
[2:37:08] that's all it takes to kind of just
[2:37:09] break somebody because if she would have
[2:37:11] fussed and handled in any kind of way I
[2:37:13] would have just rolled out and probably
[2:37:14] went somewhere else and got lost further
[2:37:16] deeper yeah but um I just want to share
[2:37:18] that to you young people if you got a
[2:37:19] parent and a father that's together and
[2:37:22] they work on you guys trust me it's for
[2:37:24] your best best insurance because sin
[2:37:28] will take you further than you want to
[2:37:29] go and cost you way more than you was
[2:37:31] willing to pay I promise you that
[2:37:37] thanks amen
[2:37:41] what a wonderful
[2:37:43] what a wonderful testimony appreciate
[2:37:46] you sharing that sister Rebecca
[2:37:48] appreciate Mama being there because
[2:37:50] she's the wrecker wouldn't be here today
[2:37:51] Mama Wouldn't Die she didn't act the way
[2:37:53] she did that day come on Zoe
[2:37:56] I learned in that more and more every
[2:37:58] day that I go I just you know just let
[2:38:01] God do the work you can't be their Holy
[2:38:03] Spirit God's got to be their Holy Spirit
[2:38:06] when God does the work he'll do it right
[2:38:16] or you can stand right here
[2:38:21] in Nicaragua there was a city called
[2:38:23] neon and basically
[2:38:27] basically over there
[2:38:29] um in Hispanic culture they like support
[2:38:32] like the solar system
[2:38:34] so there was a really big church and it
[2:38:36] was a Catholic Church
[2:38:38] and um
[2:38:41] there were like so many statues there it
[2:38:43] was so big
[2:38:45] and then I asked my dad because he used
[2:38:47] to be a Catholic well all those statues
[2:38:49] meant he explained to me them and then
[2:38:51] and I'm like
[2:38:53] all of those statues
[2:38:55] they don't make sense it's like
[2:38:58] it's kind of like cutting off pieces of
[2:39:00] a puzzle just to force it to fit it in
[2:39:03] the like masterpiece
[2:39:05] and I didn't understand no like what
[2:39:08] their like uh rituals were people were
[2:39:11] sitting there for hours praying I didn't
[2:39:13] know what they were saying it's like
[2:39:17] why are you doing this
[2:39:19] why
[2:39:22] so then I keep walking around I keep
[2:39:25] looking on all these things and it was
[2:39:28] just so confusing but as soon as I
[2:39:30] walked out of that Catholic Church I
[2:39:32] felt a little more safe with my family
[2:39:38] and I'm actually happy to be here
[2:39:41] because I'm not being forced to
[2:39:44] pray
[2:39:45] by the amount of time a candle will like
[2:39:48] light up and then melt down
[2:39:50] I feel I feel really free to pray
[2:39:54] by myself or with people
[2:39:57] praying praying were and praying in the
[2:40:01] right religion is a lot better than just
[2:40:02] being a Catholic
[2:40:05] now that I realize that religions are
[2:40:08] not just religions they they're just
[2:40:10] basically Babylon
[2:40:12] they just feel this confusion
[2:40:13] yeah yeah
[2:40:15] [Music]
[2:40:18] and there's um
[2:40:20] there was also another time in the
[2:40:23] island that we went to
[2:40:24] there was a church
[2:40:26] and I it was a really small Church
[2:40:29] I was sitting there well I wasn't really
[2:40:31] exactly sitting in the church I was
[2:40:33] outside because it was really hot in the
[2:40:34] church so I was sitting over there and
[2:40:36] then there was a drunk man who walked
[2:40:39] like into the entrance of the church and
[2:40:42] then he was just sitting there putting
[2:40:43] his shoulder on the wall and I was
[2:40:45] really like I didn't know if I was angry
[2:40:48] or confused or annoyed that he was there
[2:40:51] he just like subtly made me feel angry
[2:40:53] that he was just there
[2:40:55] so then my sister
[2:40:57] um told us to get back and get back and
[2:41:00] um the what's it called Sanctuary
[2:41:01] Sanctuary yeah so then we went back to
[2:41:03] the sanctuary and then he so then we
[2:41:06] were just we were just done praying and
[2:41:08] then he walks in and he says in Spanish
[2:41:10] he says in Spanish
[2:41:13] hey
[2:41:14] you're mentioning mentioning about God
[2:41:16] and everything oh Jesus the celestial
[2:41:18] father but then you're not mentioning
[2:41:20] about Holy Mary
[2:41:21] and I was everyone there was confused
[2:41:25] and then the pastor was like oh that's
[2:41:27] because you're a Catholic right and then
[2:41:30] he was like no I'm not a cast like I'm
[2:41:32] right
[2:41:34] so they kind of had to take him out of
[2:41:36] the church and I realized well
[2:41:39] Catholicism isn't really right and it's
[2:41:42] really confusing as well
[2:41:44] and as confuses that man he couldn't it
[2:41:47] to add on to that he was drunk
[2:41:49] um it confused that drunk man to
[2:41:51] thinking that he was right
[2:41:54] so I'm really thankful to be in this
[2:41:56] church and to know that that everyone
[2:41:58] here believes on the right thing
[2:42:01] that's a lot to say
[2:42:06] [Applause]
[2:42:10] well that's a miracle that's the most
[2:42:12] I've ever heard of her say anything
[2:42:13] since the time she was born let me just
[2:42:16] say this sometimes we get scared we're
[2:42:18] like oh we don't want our kids to visit
[2:42:20] that church or Catholic church or go see
[2:42:22] let them go see let me go get an
[2:42:24] experience and then they'll come and
[2:42:26] appreciate what they have what they've
[2:42:27] grew up we didn't that's not what we
[2:42:30] were our plans but that's what she came
[2:42:32] out of that so
[2:42:37] let's sing Amazing Grace
[2:42:40] let's thank amazing grace before we go
[2:42:42] home and really mean it
