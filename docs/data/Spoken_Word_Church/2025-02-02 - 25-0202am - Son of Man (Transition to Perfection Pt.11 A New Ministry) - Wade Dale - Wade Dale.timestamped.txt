[16:10] Lord good morning Ola
[16:16] everyone um sometimes when the preaching
[16:19] is going on the word is coming
[16:23] forward I think of a song or a verse or
[16:26] a chorus that goes along with what's
[16:28] being said
[16:30] I've been sitting on these two lines for
[16:32] years y'all years just never the
[16:35] opportunity to say them but once I say
[16:38] them you're going to recognize because
[16:39] we've heard it a thousand times and it
[16:43] goes like
[16:45] this into the sea of
[16:49] forgetfulness you placed all of my
[16:52] sins I'm the one that keeps reminding
[16:55] you over and over again into the sea of
[17:01] forgetfulness you placed all of my
[17:05] sins I'm the one that keeps going back
[17:09] over and over again amen we try to go
[17:13] back fish in that water in that sea of
[17:17] forgetfulness
[17:18] why
[17:20] why you heard me um I think I heard
[17:24] brother brandom
[17:26] say that it's the old songs that will
[17:29] carry us
[17:31] through so this is my one of my favorite
[17:34] choruses from the old and it goes like
[17:38] this shut in with God in a secret
[17:45] place there in the spirit
[17:50] beholding his
[17:52] face gaining new power to run in this
[17:58] race

[28:02] them Father just give us this day our
[28:04] daily bread Lord forgive us of our
[28:05] trespasses be with us today in the
[28:07] further of this service in Jesus name we
[28:09] pray amen we're going to take a little
[28:12] uh detour uh we were talking about a new
[28:14] doctrine but I was studying uh yesterday
[28:17] afternoon and uh a thought came to my
[28:19] mind that as we are um human beings
[28:25] there's a course that we all must take
[28:28] all right now that course that we take
[28:31] takes us through justification
[28:34] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[28:36] Ghost because remember three is
[28:38] perfection seven is completion but three
[28:40] is perfection everything God does pretty
[28:43] much he does in threes father son Holy
[28:45] Ghost Lord Jesus Christ all that all
[28:48] right is everybody with me on that so
[28:50] there's a requirement though that we
[28:52] must enter
[28:55] into and that's a required Doctrine
[28:59] they don't have it pulled up there yet
[29:00] but they will in a minute it's a
[29:02] required Doctrine it's like going to
[29:03] school if you're going to go to law
[29:05] school you're going to go to Harvard
[29:07] you're not going to go to pedmont
[29:08] college nothing against pedmont I went
[29:10] there but it's not a it's not a school
[29:12] for lawyers all right so you just don't
[29:14] go there if you know if you're going to
[29:15] be an attorney you're going to go to
[29:16] Harvard Yale or somewhere you can afford
[29:18] maybe ug or something like that but your
[29:21] specialization
[29:23] degree is where you're want to go to if
[29:25] you want to have in your mind brother
[29:26] Michael has in his mind he wants to be a
[29:28] a civil engineer well he needs to go
[29:30] take engineer classes right I mean he's
[29:33] got the required courses he needs to
[29:34] take the basic on but then when he gets
[29:36] up to a little more advanced he's got to
[29:38] take a lot of what a lot of math amen a
[29:43] lot of math and understand math and know
[29:46] how to put it on a piece of paper M
[29:47] Michael's
[29:49] going but anyway so we are required in
[29:53] this end time to become perfect
[29:57] Christian
[29:59] Amen in an imperfect
[30:02] body amen and an imperfect
[30:07] world all right but that's a requirement
[30:10] because God told us what he would do and
[30:13] even brother R tells us I I was looking
[30:15] up the word required and brother R says
[30:17] it a lot and we're going to get into a
[30:19] little bit today kind of divert a little
[30:20] bit not take so much time but let's go
[30:23] now to uh and read our scripture in 1
[30:25] Corinthians
[30:26] 2:9 appreciate brother Manuel back there
[30:29] interpreting we appreciate the the
[30:32] brothers that have come we we prayed
[30:33] many many many times that that God will
[30:36] send us some people for our Hispanic uh
[30:39] speaking brothers and sisters that can
[30:41] understand the word of God when it's
[30:43] being preached and we sure do appreciate
[30:44] them amen 1 Corinthians 2:9 but as it is
[30:48] written I have not seen nor ear heard
[30:50] neither enter into the heart of man the
[30:52] things which God hath prepared now watch
[30:54] God prepared I think about this morning
[30:56] you know God when he developed his plan
[30:59] he's Eternal he has no he has no other
[31:02] thought so this is his
[31:04] thought there's no time element in his
[31:07] thought his thought's
[31:08] eternal but he had to
[31:12] see to make the
[31:15] plan all right is everybody with me he
[31:18] saw that uh brother Ryan would need a
[31:21] certain scripture he had somebody write
[31:23] that 2,000 years ago 3,000 years ago
[31:25] 4,000 years ago
[31:26] Moses each one of you sitting here today
[31:29] you're part of the word of God because
[31:31] what God saw you needed now of course he
[31:33] saw
[31:34] some that turns it away he saw something
[31:38] that wouldn't take it he saw something
[31:39] that would drop out of school all right
[31:42] everybody with me but he saw somebody
[31:44] that's going to put on the cap and gown
[31:47] of unmar grace and favor and wear that
[31:50] to a graduation amen everybody with me
[31:53] you just got to realize and figure out
[31:56] for yourself that it's you
[31:58] cuz God already knows he knows the end
[32:01] from the beginning but he put these
[32:03] things he even put a prophet on the
[32:04] earth that give us a required doctrine
[32:06] that we're supposed to
[32:08] have but God hath revealed them unto us
[32:11] by his spirit for the spirit searches
[32:12] all things yay the Deep things of God so
[32:15] it's all right to get in deep water all
[32:18] right for what man knoweth the things of
[32:20] a man save the spirit of the man which
[32:22] is in him like I said before if brother
[32:24] Michael's going to be a civil engineer
[32:26] he's got to study that
[32:28] and and and you know he may have to work
[32:30] at McDonald's to pay for his degree but
[32:32] once he gets out he's got to go do what
[32:34] the degree says you and I have got to do
[32:37] what the degree tells us for this end
[32:39] time to do and that's to
[32:42] become mure Christians right not babies
[32:47] and mature enough to where God can stand
[32:49] there and not say oh don't say that no
[32:52] he gives us full Authority that's what
[32:54] that's what we're looking at when we're
[32:55] talking about this new ministry brother
[32:56] rhe thir pull and all those things
[32:58] speaking of the word not just taking it
[33:01] in but speaking it all right everybody
[33:03] with me for what man knoweth the things
[33:05] of a man save the spirit of the man
[33:06] which is in him we study all these
[33:08] different things mechanics and all these
[33:09] different things even so the things of
[33:11] God knoweth no man but the spirit of God
[33:13] so we need to study the word of God now
[33:15] we have received not the spirit of the
[33:17] world but the spirit which is of god if
[33:19] you're born again today that's you that
[33:21] we might know the things now watch that
[33:23] we might know the things that are freely
[33:25] given to us of God you may be SE the
[33:27] Lord as his Blessing to the reading the
[33:29] word and I want to take it in this
[33:31] aspect if you don't mind
[33:33] today because what's happening is is
[33:36] when we're transitioning to a a new
[33:38] message or we're transitioning from
[33:41] partial to perfect or from from um from
[33:44] being babies to being adults all right
[33:47] there's a transition or a shift Jesus
[33:50] comes out and he he says I give you a
[33:53] new
[33:54] commandment I give you a new way amen
[33:57] now wasn't new that he developed he took
[33:59] it from the Old Testament he just
[34:01] magnified it okay everybody with me so
[34:04] new doesn't mean nothing here there's
[34:05] something there when it is in God cuz
[34:07] remember we're look in Revelation 21 now
[34:11] see here's one of the great Revelations
[34:13] that we got from brother brandom is
[34:15] God's not going to totally annihilate
[34:17] this earth right even though it says a
[34:21] new Heaven and a new Earth all right
[34:24] just like me and you he is not going to
[34:26] annihilate your body if your body is
[34:28] blown to Pieces it will come back
[34:30] together if you're bride I just believe
[34:32] that God knows where every sell listen
[34:34] he knew wherever sell was in the ground
[34:37] from the food your mom and daddy ate to
[34:40] develop you sometimes we we think boy
[34:43] that's impossible well I thought the
[34:45] Bible says With
[34:46] God all things are possible amen so
[34:50] Revelations 21 if we're going to talk
[34:51] about we're looking at this transition
[34:54] to Perfection now that's the word being
[34:56] given to us all right the doctrines
[34:59] being turned back to the faith of the
[35:01] Fathers as we've been speaking but you
[35:03] got to we got to we got to bring it in
[35:05] and live it we've got to we've got to
[35:06] absorb it and become it yes we can just
[35:10] hear it and it just bounce off our head
[35:11] that does us no good but it will go into
[35:14] somebody because John
[35:16] saw a new Heaven and a new Earth now he
[35:19] not only saw he didn't see Brick and
[35:23] Mortar he saw
[35:26] people sister Ruth pointed her finger
[35:28] she said me you ought to say the same
[35:31] thing John saw me and you coming down
[35:34] out of Heaven as a restored
[35:37] bride white no
[35:42] wrinkles and adorned for a husband who
[35:45] is happy to be your
[35:48] husband and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[35:51] Earth so if we're going to talk about
[35:52] this new message or this new thing that
[35:55] that people um of course they're
[35:57] combating it online that's fine with me
[35:59] I don't care but a new Heaven and a new
[36:01] Earth so there's got to be something
[36:04] taken from the old listen to me
[36:06] something taken from the old and made
[36:09] new by the word of God yes what's going
[36:14] to turn a new Heaven or the old heaven
[36:17] and old Earth what's going to turn it to
[36:18] a new Heaven and new earth the word of
[36:20] God absolutely and that's what's going
[36:22] to change me and you the word of
[36:26] God now saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[36:29] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[36:31] were passed away that's where brother R
[36:33] gets the word Anon and which doesn't
[36:35] mean annihilate it just means change
[36:37] form all right same way with me and you
[36:39] when you became a Christian you got the
[36:40] same hand you had when you were a
[36:43] devil right some of y'all weren't but
[36:46] that's okay some of us were God didn't
[36:49] have to take this old flesh and throw it
[36:51] away and then bring you in New flesh he
[36:53] took the flesh you had see I'm telling
[36:55] you folks this is the Great mystery am
[36:59] this is the greatest mystery since the
[37:00] dawn of time is that God is going to
[37:03] perfect a bride sitting in human flesh
[37:07] that is the world looks at you and
[37:09] you're like they're like I don't see
[37:11] anything it's not for the world to
[37:14] see we are a mystery you want to talk
[37:16] about the mystery of God to be finished
[37:18] that's me and you being finished that's
[37:21] you and I being finished that's the word
[37:23] of God being in you and I finishing this
[37:25] thing up because you know what there's
[37:27] no other
[37:28] we're it this is it there's no other but
[37:32] the first heaven and first Earth were
[37:33] passed away in other words what when I
[37:36] saw this when you look at Paul when he
[37:38] says leaving the principles of the
[37:40] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[37:42] perfection in other words not going to
[37:45] annihilate Heaven you're not going to
[37:46] annihilate Earth uhuh you're just going
[37:49] to change his form you're going to
[37:50] change it Absol amen is everybody with
[37:52] me so he's going to do that's why I love
[37:55] the future home he's he's doing the
[37:57] believer the same way he does the Heaven
[37:59] and Earth but it's from justification
[38:02] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[38:03] three first Paul second pull third pull
[38:06] everything three 1 2 3 1 2 three
[38:08] everybody with me so we're going to stay
[38:10] with that for a little while all right
[38:12] and I John saw the holy city New
[38:14] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[38:16] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a
[38:20] husband he saw us completed come on and
[38:25] you're the city so you're going to be
[38:28] the one that's going to settle on this
[38:29] Earth come on subdue it oh yeah we're
[38:32] going to have fun in the
[38:34] Millennium but remember death is still
[38:38] there time is still there the devil is
[38:43] still there okay but not in us no we the
[38:48] bride has come to a place to where she
[38:50] is without spot or wrinkle here on this
[38:52] side all right everybody with me and
[38:55] it's by the word of God and it's by us
[38:58] being restored back you got to start by
[39:00] the faith of the fathers you got to
[39:02] start there all right what we've been
[39:04] harping on we got to start whatever they
[39:07] had in the book of Acts the book of
[39:10] Corinthians Paul James Peter all those
[39:14] great ones they had the faith of the
[39:17] fathers they were the fathers and they
[39:20] had the faith but you and I started as
[39:23] children and now we got to grow up to
[39:26] that faith of the fathers yes now listen
[39:28] we got to have
[39:31] faith we got to have faith to believe
[39:33] they were
[39:35] right amen we got to have faith to
[39:38] believe they were right then when we do
[39:40] that when we believe that they had it
[39:43] and now we have it the same way they had
[39:45] it then brother rown says then now it
[39:47] takes rapturing Faith see it takes a
[39:51] higher Faith to go it's the same
[39:53] Faith it's the same Faith but now it's
[39:56] going to be Perfection faith faith is
[39:58] going to take us and we're going to
[40:00] believe that right now amen death has no
[40:04] hold on you right now you got to start
[40:07] believing you say I don't feel like it
[40:08] nobody act Jesus didn't say how do you
[40:11] feel it he said Do you believe it yes
[40:15] Abraham I'll promise you Abraham went to
[40:17] bed that night after he met mzd and he
[40:20] probably groan and ate on his way
[40:24] down and probably had to straighten his
[40:26] leg he was 9 9 years old when he went to
[40:30] bed he wasn't when he woke back up there
[40:33] was a change that night God changed his
[40:36] atoms in his body didn't take his body
[40:38] and throw it away and bring another one
[40:40] he changed that body and then he reached
[40:42] over and changed Sarah's body and they
[40:44] got up real fast not like they went down
[40:47] well same way with you and I what a
[40:50] glorious time yes this word is changing
[40:52] us it should be changing us every day
[40:55] every week every hour every every time
[40:57] we do every time we read the word of God
[41:00] it should change us into that image that
[41:02] God saw all right everybody with me on
[41:05] that but remember man got involved and
[41:10] that wasn't all just man it was the
[41:11] devil the devil got involved in
[41:16] man and they started believing things
[41:19] that were not in the Bible they started
[41:21] believe in things that was not in the
[41:22] new Old
[41:23] Testament when they went to n
[41:27] they started believing things that
[41:28] wern't even in the Bible at all Trinity
[41:31] all these different things that we
[41:32] talking about so what do they do by
[41:35] their influence they killed the word of
[41:37] God they didn't kill the word of God
[41:38] they killed the effects of the word of
[41:40] God and you and I today it's like
[41:43] brother the Bible say there there
[41:44] there's things that activate in our life
[41:46] that we can close God down or we can
[41:48] open it up absolutely we can absolutely
[41:51] everybody with me we can do that so
[41:54] that's why we have to get things right
[41:55] we have to get things out of the way
[41:57] that's why we have to have a restored
[41:59] Doctrine but a required Doctrine and
[42:02] we'll read that in just a few minutes
[42:03] where brother B tells us that Hallelujah
[42:06] so Jesus comes down off the mountain he
[42:07] says tell this Vision to no man what was
[42:10] the vision that he was talking about we
[42:13] don't talk about that much what was the
[42:15] vision he
[42:17] saw Moses Elijah and
[42:22] Jesus transformed or transfigured on the
[42:25] mountain yes
[42:27] all right brother Brown was talking
[42:29] about that you know they were telling
[42:30] him about his second coming they were
[42:32] revealing it to him and then now where's
[42:35] Moses and Elijah in this whole fix
[42:37] they're going to be over there when we
[42:38] leave but the son of man was standing in
[42:41] the middle of them and when Peter looked
[42:43] up and said let's build three
[42:44] Tabernacles he gets all um excited but
[42:48] when he turns and looks the next time he
[42:50] sees Jesus that's the one he's got to
[42:52] follow he can't we're not to follow
[42:54] Moses and Elijah that Elijah you
[42:57] understand number five we're supposed to
[42:59] number four but not number five but
[43:01] anyway even on that mountain who was
[43:03] left Jesus Christ he was the only one
[43:05] left on the whole Mountain so he says
[43:07] tell this Vision to no man until the son
[43:08] of man be risen again from the dead
[43:10] brother R tells us and we talked about
[43:12] the indictment where that they have
[43:14] killed him they killed him and put him
[43:16] back on the cross now you talk about
[43:18] people and and I'll not read this to
[43:21] save time but remember brother Brown
[43:22] said he said the same spirit that put
[43:25] Jesus on the cross
[43:28] is here
[43:29] today same devil that put Jesus on the
[43:32] cross who put him on the cross the
[43:34] Sinners nope the prostitutes
[43:38] nope the religious people of the world
[43:41] it's what put him on the cross and
[43:42] that's what's happening now that's why
[43:44] there's got to be a restored word back
[43:46] there's that's why there's got to be a
[43:48] as we're going to read here in a minute
[43:49] a special group of
[43:51] people that has prophetic Insight you
[43:54] and I know what's going to happen I
[43:57] don't care what Mr Trump's going to do
[43:59] it doesn't matter we know how this is
[44:01] going to end up there's going to be a
[44:03] beast and an image brother Brown said
[44:06] the Beast was a pop and the image was
[44:08] the United States yes sir give me
[44:10] something
[44:11] else that's why we're going to have to
[44:13] be a military we're going to have to be
[44:15] a power cuz we're going to speak for the
[44:19] pope well praise God you believe it or
[44:21] not but that's we're in a system now
[44:24] that that's what's going to happen amen
[44:29] just be
[44:30] ready cuz we may be you think well we
[44:34] got a religious president that's
[44:38] baloney the last one I think was Abraham
[44:41] Lincoln brother R said and George
[44:42] Washington so we're way up the road this
[44:46] way I'm just telling you what he said
[44:48] some of them may go to heaven I don't
[44:49] know but the corruptness of what's going
[44:51] on see the spirit of this time the
[44:54] requirement of this time is is for them
[44:56] to turn up the heat on the true
[44:59] bride somehow they're not going to pick
[45:01] us out and say well that's brandom
[45:02] people and we're going to we're going to
[45:04] follow Bob they already follow him
[45:05] anyway we're going to follow sorry buddy
[45:08] we're going to follow we're going to
[45:09] follow you know all the we're going to
[45:12] follow they follow us anyway I mean how
[45:15] in the world we were uh brother Joe and
[45:17] I were talking that um on the uh

[45:41] church I'll show it to you after service
[45:44] for brother Wilson and I have been
[45:45] conversing and I told him I'd like for
[45:46] him to come preach for us cu the people
[45:49] but so brother Wilson Henry those like
[45:50] brother um Joe was saying how everything
[45:53] comes around full circle starts out
[45:55] there he's out in Arizona he's
[45:57] conversing with us and and asking about
[46:00] each one of you that hadn't seen Mom he
[46:02] asked about her brother Gary that's your
[46:03] brother-in-law but back when and uh so

[46:08] because he clicked online and he watches
[46:10] us and he may be watching us now but
[46:12] sorry brother Wilson I called your name
[46:14] but he sent me a message one day about a
[46:16] year ago and he said man your hair sure

[46:34] that's how much of an impact we have of
[46:36] all of us connected to somebody that we
[46:38] knew way years and years ago that have
[46:41] come back together and there was another
[46:42] brother in Augusta that sent a message
[46:45] the other day two messages actually and
[46:47] said he really appreciated us being on
[46:48] Facebook live cuz that's why he was
[46:50] watching us and we had known him since
[46:52] he was a kid back in Augusta at brother
[46:54] Glenn Do's church so um but what am I
[46:57] saying I'm saying that we are it this is
[46:59] all come on this is all that God's going
[47:03] to do he's doing it through the bride
[47:06] and he's getting us together he's not
[47:07] separating us the world would love to
[47:10] separate us maybe even they want to
[47:12] separ the religious World wants to
[47:13] separate
[47:14] us but the reason they're W to do it is
[47:17] is because there's an unfamiliar Spirit
[47:19] among
[47:21] them amen your spirit is not familiar
[47:24] with this world it shouldn't be now as I
[47:26] read that SCP
[47:28] amen now we live in the world we do we
[47:30] act listen your body is not
[47:33] perfect your spirit realm to a degree is
[47:36] not perfect working on it but your soul
[47:39] is either perfect or not absolutely one
[47:42] of the two but even as a born again
[47:44] believer your spirit realm is still
[47:47] being impacted by the world that's right
[47:50] that's why we have to have a statute of
[47:51] a perfect man that's why brother Ram
[47:53] said these virtues are required that's
[47:56] where I got this um got this from they
[47:58] they
[48:00] required
[48:05] Doctrine so Jesus tells us that El Li
[48:07] truly shall first come and restore all
[48:09] things do you know when he spoke that
[48:12] word he had you and I on his mind
[48:15] because it was never restored until the
[48:17] end time yes sir come on John the
[48:21] Baptist was dead by
[48:22] then they right cut his head off so
[48:25] Elijah number four is only one that can
[48:27] do that cuz now what's he going to do
[48:29] when he goes over there he's going to go
[48:31] over there and get a group of 144,000
[48:34] and get them baptized with the Holy
[48:36] Ghost but they're not
[48:38] bride they're going to be restored back
[48:41] to True Israel but they're not bride
[48:43] that's right you and I are the only
[48:46] people that are bride abolutely the
[48:49] world is not
[48:50] bride that's right that's right so we're
[48:54] coming to we're in we're not coming
[48:56] we're in a restoration message
[48:58] absolutely if you're not being restored
[49:00] today you got to catch up you got to
[49:04] well I'll read it to you in a minute
[49:06] brother M says look then I mention it
[49:08] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[49:09] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[49:11] bringing these two thoughts together now
[49:14] watch bring the two thoughts together
[49:16] you'll see that it won't take just
[49:17] ordinary study I was telling you this
[49:19] the other day when you go to college
[49:21] when I went to college from high school
[49:23] yeah I was straight A I never did make a
[49:25] bee in high school don't ask me about
[49:27] the first year of
[49:29] college cuz I didn't think you had to
[49:31] study I just want to play
[49:34] ball but it's a requirement that you
[49:36] study amen it's a requirement for you to
[49:40] study the subject that you are going to
[49:43] go to graduate
[49:45] in even though it may be four years away
[49:48] 40 years away for some of us 50 years
[49:50] away 30 years away 20 years away there
[49:52] is going to be a graduation day yes sir
[49:56] where we're going to to get the diploma
[49:58] the absolute unmar Grace Ring Of God is
[50:01] going to be placed on our hand and he's
[50:04] going to be happy Amen to do it amen
[50:07] sure he's happy with us now but he's
[50:08] going to be happy to slip that band on
[50:12] your
[50:13] finger yes sir he'll be smiling he'll
[50:16] say finally that's the one I saw before
[50:18] the foundation of the world that's the
[50:20] people I saw before the foundation of
[50:22] the world you and I are recipients of
[50:25] his grace
[50:27] Hallelujah and we're also recipients of
[50:30] his
[50:30] wedding cuz we're the bride there is no
[50:34] other bride you and I are the bride
[50:37] there's not two Brides standing at the
[50:39] altar unless you weird like the people
[50:41] are now but it's usually one male one
[50:44] female all right I like what Trump said
[50:46] say did say the other day he said
[50:47] where's going to be just two genders
[50:49] male and a female well thank God for
[50:51] that but you know how many they going
[50:53] how many people going to listen to that
[50:54] brother John none none of them
[50:57] them because it's a perversion so now
[51:01] watch this book now what this Bible
[51:03] can't be reveal to anyone but a special
[51:06] class of people it will take one with
[51:09] prophetic Insight all right now watch it
[51:12] requires the ability to hear from God
[51:16] that's why study to show yourself
[51:18] approved that's
[51:20] right not just come to church and let
[51:22] the pastor do it for you study yourself
[51:25] it doesn't matter if it's 15 minutes
[51:27] just get your mind on God for a little
[51:29] while get it off of everything else and
[51:32] I know it's tough I know it
[51:36] is man I'll promise you it's coming up a
[51:38] year I've been pastor of the church and
[51:40] I sure appreciate your or most of your
[51:44] confidence can't please everybody but um
[51:48] daddy my daddy said if you please
[51:50] everybody you're a
[51:51] hypocrite so that I'm not so um amen
[51:56] anyway
[51:58] so I come here and I I have to think
[52:01] about something to do bring the
[52:03] preachers in it's kind of like almost
[52:05] like being an
[52:06] administrator also being a pastor you
[52:08] got to be administrator because I got to
[52:10] take care of all you I want all you to
[52:11] be comfortable I want all you to be
[52:13] happy I want all of you to have
[52:14] something to do I don't want you just
[52:15] come into church and just sit here and
[52:16] listen to Somebody preach there's things
[52:18] I like to do and there's things that we
[52:20] can do as a church and and you go back
[52:22] and I you know I got three different
[52:24] calendars in the back making schedules
[52:26] of who to bring in to preach and you
[52:27] pray over things you pray over the
[52:29] things that we're going to do like the
[52:30] Valentine's banquet and and we're going
[52:32] to have a July the 4th meeting again
[52:34] we're going to have this again we're
[52:35] going to have that again we're going to
[52:36] brother we're going to brother Andre's
[52:40] July the 18th 19th and 20th so put that
[52:44] on your calendar Thursday Friday uh
[52:46] Friday Saturday and Sunday remember we
[52:48] went most of those went last year pre
[52:50] please make a point to go we'd love to
[52:53] we'd love to uh to have everybody there
[52:57] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[52:59] the spirit or it never becomes
[53:04] clear how we need to hear from God and
[53:07] lay ourselves open and become yielded to
[53:09] the spirit to hear and know
[53:13] amen there's a lot of things we know
[53:15] about do we know a lot about
[53:18] God I mean there's a lot of things we
[53:20] know about but do we know enough about
[53:24] God cuz see
[53:27] I think brother Bob read if you'll read
[53:28] that book it's either intervail or why
[53:31] are my people so tossed about that one
[53:34] yeah you you read a quote out that right
[53:35] why are my people so tossed about read
[53:38] that book if you're tossed
[53:40] about go read the book there's your
[53:44] required that's your required study if
[53:46] you're being beat up and knocked around
[53:48] sure we all are but you just got to know
[53:50] how to handle it why are my people so
[53:53] tossed about brother Brown said it's
[53:54] because of what it's because of people
[53:56] not being born again basically about
[54:00] people not being born again that's who
[54:01] gets tossed
[54:03] about but remember when we become
[54:05] Christians we're not be TOS tossed about
[54:08] by every wind of Doctrine that's right
[54:09] right as the Bible says or the slot of
[54:12] man that's
[54:13] right look if Revelation is beyond you
[54:16] I've read this two Sundays in a r or
[54:17] read it third if Revelation is beyond
[54:20] you I can't get it all right that comes
[54:23] out of your mind I can't get this have
[54:25] you made your yourself available to get
[54:27] it have you even studied the scripture
[54:29] we read or studied the book you know you
[54:31] don't have to if you don't want to but
[54:33] don't look at me and say I can't
[54:35] understand it God put somebody here
[54:38] either me brother Bob even brother
[54:40] Michael different one Sunday school
[54:42] class teachers brother Aaron anybody
[54:44] that brother Ryan he put put somebody
[54:47] here to answer your question if hold on
[54:49] minut if you're his
[54:53] child am he cannot teach the devil child
[54:58] anything sorry about that he
[55:01] can't remember famous quote from Brother
[55:04] Dale years ago he said God does not
[55:09] adopt can you finish it the devil's
[55:14] kids he won't they're not his he's not
[55:18] obligated to them but when you get born
[55:20] again he's obligated to see you through
[55:23] absolutely but you got to make yourself
[55:25] available amen amen right that's the way
[55:28] you
[55:30] are that's the way you are ever going to
[55:32] get it a revelation is to come from God
[55:34] it never comes by human natural
[55:37] endowments you can get up here and you
[55:38] can be so eloquent you can speak your
[55:40] words so nice and you can speak so fine
[55:43] and keep half of y'all
[55:46] awake but it's not going to come by it's
[55:48] going to come by what not
[55:51] endowments endowments is something I I I
[55:54] give him some money I'm giving him some
[55:55] money to give it to a school that's an
[55:57] endowment all right but an
[56:00] enduement Jesus said go to the Jerusalem
[56:03] till you be what ued we read that what
[56:06] was that a long time ago endued means go
[56:08] in if you're endued with power from on
[56:11] high it's got to go in so brother R says
[56:12] but by spiritual Endo not endowment you
[56:16] can even memorize the scripture and
[56:18] though that's wonderful that won't do
[56:20] it it has to be a revelation from God I
[56:23] like what Dad said one time he said he
[56:25] said you know I don't I don't I can't
[56:27] give you and I maybe not be able to find
[56:29] you know give you the answer he said but
[56:31] I know you give me long enough he said
[56:33] I'll find it in the Bible or I'll find
[56:34] it in the prophet's message there'll be
[56:35] an answer to that question and see
[56:38] because why he
[56:40] searched H he knew where to find it do
[56:44] you know where to find it not me you got
[56:48] to find it for
[56:49] yourself amen search out your own
[56:52] salvation with fear and trembling we may
[56:54] not get anywhere today but I believe
[56:56] believe we need to get this thing
[56:58] settled that we're not tossed about that
[57:00] we're you're listen you're going to have
[57:02] storms you're going to have them you're
[57:05] having them right
[57:10] now but as I said many times before a
[57:14] tragedy defines a Christian it doesn't
[57:16] destroy God can't destroy his own
[57:20] kids but you got to figure out whether
[57:22] you a kid or not if you're not his kid
[57:25] and you got an you become his
[57:28] kid amen because every tragedy look at
[57:32] David come on what a
[57:35] tragedy look at all the different one
[57:37] Moses what a tragedy a murderer look at
[57:41] all the things in the in the Old
[57:43] Testament all those people even Paul
[57:46] Paul had a tragedy he was killing
[57:49] Christians or having them killed right
[57:52] Peter was cutting people's ears off
[57:54] cussing at God yes just to be southern
[57:58] English cousing of God or
[58:01] cursing right but God used every one of
[58:04] them in a powerful way because they got
[58:07] rid of that and yielded theirself to God
[58:10] went to the upper room found out that
[58:12] they were his kids and then they said
[58:16] Dad help me Father help me to understand
[58:20] what's going on it says in the word that
[58:22] no man can say that Jesus is Christ
[58:24] except by the Holy Ghost you have to
[58:26] receive the Holy Ghost huh see there and
[58:28] then and only then can the spirit give
[58:31] you the Revelation that Jesus is the
[58:33] Christ the anointed one that's why my
[58:35] brother R tells us and even Paul Peter
[58:37] tells us get the divine nature of God
[58:40] that is the new birth yes it is a divine
[58:42] nature of God you got to get that before
[58:45] you can grow yes
[58:48] sir amen you got to get in the right
[58:50] School know what right books to read
[58:54] know what to study come on well get the
[58:57] divine nature of God and I'll promise
[58:59] you he will anoint what you're looking
[59:02] at that's way he does me brother Bob
[59:05] different on we know that when we're
[59:06] looking here we somebody I mean we may
[59:08] read that we may read that and be doing
[59:10] this and find another one but
[59:12] something's going to pop out amen amen
[59:15] then you go back over here to the same
[59:16] one you flipped over and you go well I
[59:18] missed that why wasn't your time right
[59:21] God had God had got the cogs in your
[59:23] mind working and then all of a sudden
[59:26] boom he drops
[59:28] down how many times have you read
[59:30] scripture how many times y'all read the
[59:32] Bible brother College probably read it
[59:33] 100 times over and over again but I'll
[59:35] guarantee you he'll come to me and say
[59:36] you know the Bible said that he's read
[59:39] it 100 times amen but it wasn't your
[59:41] time to see it that's why it's an
[59:43] eternal word of
[59:44] God it just keeps unfolding every little
[59:48] thing I just turned to the Book of
[59:50] Esther who would have known who Mori was
[59:53] who would have known the actions of
[59:54] Esther would be the actions of
[59:58] us huj who would know that she had an
[1:00:02] uncle named Mori which means little
[1:00:06] man we wouldn't have known it without
[1:00:09] the spirit of God inside of us that's
[1:00:11] right to point us to that right because
[1:00:14] remember in the Book of Esther God's not
[1:00:16] even mentioned this is just a story
[1:00:18] God's not even mentioned in the Book of
[1:00:19] Esther and some of the scholars even
[1:00:21] question why that's in there and like
[1:00:24] the book of mccabes or the book of job
[1:00:26] is not in there because supposedly job
[1:00:28] wrote his own book but I'm I don't I
[1:00:31] know if he wrote this one or not but uh
[1:00:34] but they got all these other books and
[1:00:35] like brother Brown tells us that they
[1:00:36] got this book and that book but this
[1:00:38] book right here amen this is it come on
[1:00:41] this seals the deal for me I don't need
[1:00:43] I don't need somebody to bring me a book
[1:00:45] of the macbes which might be just a good
[1:00:46] history book but this has no no error no
[1:00:52] contradiction all right so now we know
[1:00:54] where the curriculum book is
[1:00:57] right and we have had a master teacher
[1:01:00] yes amen you got the Holy Ghost but you
[1:01:03] got a master teacher slides in there and
[1:01:05] he teaches his
[1:01:10] class one day we will realize what God
[1:01:14] sent me and you we'll realize I think
[1:01:17] we're trying to now but you we are a
[1:01:19] special sure enough class of people that
[1:01:22] God only is going to reveal things to us
[1:01:25] and not to nobody else in the world that
[1:01:27] is correct I just believe that we need
[1:01:30] to call on God for Revelation more than
[1:01:32] anything in the world we have accepted
[1:01:35] the Bible we have accepted the great
[1:01:37] truths of it but it still is not real to
[1:01:39] most people because the Revelation by
[1:01:42] the spirit is not
[1:01:47] there so now let's look here real
[1:01:50] quick Isaiah 28 Whom Shall he teach
[1:01:53] knowledge to whom shall he make to
[1:01:56] understand Doctrine them that are weaned
[1:01:58] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[1:02:00] Isaiah is telling us it's okay to be a
[1:02:03] baby there is milk there for you there's
[1:02:06] breast there there's elhad the breasted
[1:02:08] one where we can call on God but there's
[1:02:10] going to be a time where God's going to
[1:02:14] say don't come
[1:02:16] here you ask and you'll receive you say
[1:02:20] to this mountain be moved whatever
[1:02:23] Mountain You' got in your life say to
[1:02:26] that mountain say
[1:02:28] move and but now remember it says don't
[1:02:30] doubt in your heart cuz what's going to
[1:02:31] happen is as soon as you say move the
[1:02:33] devil's going to
[1:02:34] move it may make it worse but remember
[1:02:37] tragedy does not destroy a Christian it
[1:02:42] defines who they are abolutely
[1:02:44] look at Jesus pretty good tragedy right
[1:02:48] there hung him on a cross said he was a
[1:02:51] wine biver said he was uh had Sinners
[1:02:53] and prostitutes were his friends called
[1:02:56] him bsy buub what else do you need hung
[1:02:59] him on a cross but praise God yes that's
[1:03:02] what they
[1:03:03] did CU he did it for me and you yes sir
[1:03:07] so the teaching is that which is taught
[1:03:09] or doctrine that's what we're talking
[1:03:10] about Doctrine it's concerning
[1:03:13] something it's not just preaching A good
[1:03:15] sermon and telling you what this one
[1:03:17] said and telling you what that one said
[1:03:20] or even maybe reading quotes every once
[1:03:21] in a while but what is it it's something
[1:03:25] that that that God sorry through me some
[1:03:30] of the minister brothers are trying to
[1:03:32] get you to
[1:03:33] see amen I know like dad's always said
[1:03:37] he said I know what I'm looking at we
[1:03:39] just ain't got there
[1:03:40] yet amen and it take him you think I'm
[1:03:44] slow I was looking at something the
[1:03:45] other day on sermon 37 on marriage and
[1:03:48] divorce well good grief 37 sermons on
[1:03:51] married and divorce well that's my dad
[1:03:53] but he broke it down where we understand
[1:03:55] what's going going on and I appreciate
[1:03:58] God giving us that and being able to go
[1:04:01] back and archive those sermons and watch
[1:04:02] them too
[1:04:04] so so the act of teaching or instruction
[1:04:07] in religious Assemblies of Christians to
[1:04:09] speak in the way of teaching look in
[1:04:12] distinction from other modes of speaking
[1:04:14] in public you can't take what you have
[1:04:18] take what we're preaching today and go
[1:04:20] over to the next person over here and
[1:04:22] preach
[1:04:23] it like I said before when I go and
[1:04:25] March to preach for the Methodist Church
[1:04:27] I'm not going to tell them God s a
[1:04:28] prophet if they
[1:04:31] ask wise as a serpent harmless as death
[1:04:35] but what we speak as I was telling y'all
[1:04:37] before we speak a Heavenly language we
[1:04:40] speak an language of unknown
[1:04:45] tongues amen go tell them that they'll
[1:04:48] look at you like you're
[1:04:50] crazy if they call Jesus crazy and bails
[1:04:53] you above what they going to call you if
[1:04:55] you do the same thing I remember they
[1:04:58] were astonished at What doctrine what
[1:04:59] does doctrine do here's my point
[1:05:02] Doctrine brings
[1:05:03] power Doctrine brings confidence
[1:05:07] Doctrine brings Faith especially when we
[1:05:09] know that God can't lie that's right
[1:05:12] God's word can't lie it landed in a man
[1:05:16] that could
[1:05:20] lie but when it comes to
[1:05:23] Doctrine I'm not saying a lie any other
[1:05:25] time I was telling you he was born in
[1:05:26] sin just like me and you talking about
[1:05:28] brother Brandon amen but his Doctrine
[1:05:30] was the truth amen and we'll stand that
[1:05:34] day and say that ain't nothing but the
[1:05:35] truth now God can't honor false doctrin
[1:05:39] everybody with me God cannot honor false
[1:05:41] Doctrine and will not stand I mean he'll
[1:05:44] stand it he'll wink at it but come to a
[1:05:46] Time the Bible says where truth has got
[1:05:48] to be truth yes nothing else but that
[1:05:51] what if brother Brandon would have been
[1:05:52] a false
[1:05:53] prophet spoke a false false word and had
[1:05:57] your right said that ain't nothing but
[1:05:59] the truth brother Brandon now God would
[1:06:01] not have done what he did to that
[1:06:04] sister he gave her power through brother
[1:06:07] brandham gave power to speak eternal
[1:06:10] life you can believe this or not into
[1:06:12] those two
[1:06:13] children
[1:06:15] hello they got converted didn't they she
[1:06:18] said the salvation of my two sons and
[1:06:20] God gave them to
[1:06:22] her because the doctrine was right and
[1:06:24] the man presented was right and she
[1:06:26] agreed with
[1:06:28] it wow you say Doctrine is not important
[1:06:31] Doctrine is very important right you
[1:06:33] have no power without a Doctrine amen
[1:06:36] listen Adolf Hitler had a
[1:06:38] Doctrine he sent millions of people to
[1:06:41] death his own countrymen to death
[1:06:44] because of a doctrine that he was going
[1:06:47] to get rid of the white race I mean
[1:06:49] going to have a white race get rid of
[1:06:50] the Jews and he was going to take over
[1:06:52] the world that was his Doctrine and he
[1:06:55] preached it and they say he was greatly
[1:06:57] anointed I guess he did cuz he giv the
[1:07:02] you know I think 12 million people over
[1:07:04] there in his country gave their life
[1:07:06] just because of a Doctrine and guess
[1:07:08] what happened that Doctrine had a little
[1:07:10] bit of power but that Doctrine did not
[1:07:12] have the power of God so he ended up
[1:07:14] committing
[1:07:17] suicide Romans 16 ver 17 now beseech you
[1:07:20] Brethren mark them which cause divisions
[1:07:22] and offenses contrary to the doctrine
[1:07:24] which you have learned brother Bob
[1:07:26] covered that this
[1:07:27] morning and avoid
[1:07:30] them Ephesians 4:11 how we going to get
[1:07:33] this required
[1:07:35] Doctrine he gives some Apostles some
[1:07:37] prophets some evangelist some pastors
[1:07:39] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:07:41] Saints now are you a saint
[1:07:43] today do you want to be perfected yes
[1:07:46] sir here's the the prescribed way of
[1:07:50] doing it right very simple well I think
[1:07:53] I can no I don't care what you thought
[1:07:56] amen right for the work of the ministry
[1:07:59] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:08:01] till we now look so this is going this
[1:08:03] vehicle I think about this the other day
[1:08:05] when you read that till we all come into
[1:08:07] the unity of faith in other words we
[1:08:08] weren't that's right we were not in the
[1:08:11] unity of Faith right but under this
[1:08:14] five-fold ministry it's going to bring
[1:08:16] us together under that Doctrine yes
[1:08:20] everybody with me amen it's going to
[1:08:22] bring us together to knowledge of who
[1:08:25] the Son of God is it's going to bring us
[1:08:28] to a perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:08:31] stature of the fullness of
[1:08:33] Christ that we henceforth be no more
[1:08:35] children in other words wean off the
[1:08:41] breast that we henceforth be no more
[1:08:43] children tossed to and
[1:08:46] fro and carried about with every wind of
[1:08:49] Doctrine well I wonder if this one's
[1:08:50] right have you heard what this one said
[1:08:52] I don't know about this one you heard
[1:08:53] about what that one said what's this one
[1:08:54] got to say about about it you better run
[1:08:57] it through your
[1:08:58] filter amen whereby they lie and wait to
[1:09:01] deceive but speaking the truth and love
[1:09:03] who this five-fold ministry that's what
[1:09:06] this whole thing is about five-fold
[1:09:08] Ministry bringing us to Perfection
[1:09:10] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:09:12] into him in all things which is the head
[1:09:15] even Christ now remember God in
[1:09:17] Revelations 21 he's bringing a new
[1:09:19] Heaven and a new Earth why because the
[1:09:21] first Heaven and the first Earth is full
[1:09:23] of sin that's right the first and first
[1:09:25] Earth is full of all different things
[1:09:27] that we don't need anymore that's right
[1:09:29] same way with me and you yes sir listen
[1:09:32] you got a new Heavenly language when you
[1:09:34] got born again yes sir when he came in
[1:09:36] and possessed your Earth you started
[1:09:39] listening from things above not from
[1:09:40] things below abolutely so God changed
[1:09:43] you he's already changed
[1:09:45] you you just waiting on that yes moment
[1:09:49] in the twinkling of an eye cuz listen

[1:09:57] service there's no new
[1:10:00] book it's going to change your
[1:10:02] body it's going to come from what you
[1:10:04] got inside of
[1:10:08] you cuz that thing so
[1:10:11] strong that if the resurrection happened
[1:10:13] today brother Dale brother Mo brother

[1:10:37] that whatever they got that's now
[1:10:38] Eternal come on somebody it's Eternal in
[1:10:41] that dimmension is going to come and
[1:10:42] make it their body Eternal and stand on
[1:10:45] an earth that's not
[1:10:48] Eternal for a moment 40 or 50 days we're
[1:10:52] going to walk with them 40 50 days folks
[1:10:54] and they're going to be and we are too
[1:10:55] we're going to be changed do you believe
[1:10:58] that become a
[1:11:00] Believer if not we have no
[1:11:04] hope what the Bible say we're of men
[1:11:06] most miserable unless we know what this
[1:11:08] Doctrine
[1:11:09] is amen statue of perfect man now
[1:11:13] watch these fellas wasn't required what
[1:11:16] these fellas are now look he's pointing
[1:11:18] at the Statue of perfect man cuz he drew
[1:11:20] this chart everybody with me remember
[1:11:22] he's one
[1:11:25] God gave him the scripture remember he
[1:11:26] was squirrel hunting I believe he sat
[1:11:29] down on a tree with a piece of paper and
[1:11:30] a pen and he said this is what I drew so
[1:11:34] that's what he drew he put all that
[1:11:35] together cuz Peter didn't do that Peter
[1:11:38] just tell us add this add that add this
[1:11:40] add that right but brother Brandon put
[1:11:42] it in with all the church age Messengers
[1:11:43] correct all the church ages where the
[1:11:46] holy spirit's supposed to be there where
[1:11:48] the Capstone of love is and all those
[1:11:53] ads amen now watch amen these fellas
[1:11:55] wasn't required what these fellas are
[1:11:57] this wasn't required what this was in
[1:11:59] other words if you're not going to be a
[1:12:01] civil engineer it's not required that
[1:12:03] you learn to be
[1:12:04] one
[1:12:06] amen if you want be just a regular human
[1:12:10] that's your I don't want to be just a
[1:12:12] regular
[1:12:12] human I want to be a human with God
[1:12:15] inside of
[1:12:17] me this wasn't required what this
[1:12:20] was what each Church age had a
[1:12:22] requirement but it wasn't full
[1:12:24] requirement and it wasn't a restoration
[1:12:26] requirement remember it was a
[1:12:28] Reformation
[1:12:29] requirement but he brought his church up
[1:12:32] the same way he brought his church up
[1:12:34] the same way he's bringing his people
[1:12:38] right then Peter here says first seven
[1:12:40] things Faith virtue see come up
[1:12:43] knowledge Temperance I'm sorry I got too
[1:12:45] fast I'm sorry about that
[1:12:48] brother patience godliness brotherly
[1:12:50] love and brotherly kindness and then the
[1:12:52] love of
[1:12:53] God the holy ghost now watch Christ in
[1:12:56] the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:12:59] you in the true baptism of the Holy
[1:13:02] Ghost now brother BR have you got two
[1:13:03] baptisms here is one false and one
[1:13:07] real I'm reading what you
[1:13:11] said remember that word true Jesus was
[1:13:14] called the faithful and true witness not
[1:13:17] that he was ever false but it's like the
[1:13:19] tuning Fort it's a true if it's a SE
[1:13:22] tuning Fort when you hit that thing I
[1:13:24] don't care how long you hit it how much
[1:13:25] it's still going to ring SE everybody
[1:13:27] know what I'm talking about I don't know
[1:13:28] what you call those things what you call
[1:13:30] those things
[1:13:31] girls tun in
[1:13:34] Fork tuning fork but you hit that tuning
[1:13:38] fork and it's fit SE it's going to
[1:13:40] always ring
[1:13:42] SE so the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:45] what away from any
[1:13:51] hindrance look if you got these working
[1:13:54] in your life you got a lot less
[1:13:56] hindrance than you did down here
[1:13:59] absolutely so that's what he's talking
[1:14:01] about that Holy Spirit fills in the
[1:14:04] cracks some of us we just need the
[1:14:06] cracks filled in or some of y'all just
[1:14:08] needs the crack I need a lot more than
[1:14:09] that cracks filled inen we come to a
[1:14:13] place to we're get we're come to
[1:14:15] maturity where they just may be a little
[1:14:17] crack and and God's going to fill that
[1:14:19] in or the Holy Ghost is going to seal it
[1:14:21] in amen everybody with me but it's
[1:14:24] because of the required doctrine that
[1:14:26] you're sitting under today not just me
[1:14:28] but I'm talking about the day and hour
[1:14:29] that you live
[1:14:30] in he comes in the true baptism of the
[1:14:33] Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues
[1:14:36] sealed in
[1:14:37] you then God lives in a tabernacle
[1:14:40] called the building the living
[1:14:42] Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling
[1:14:44] Place he's not talking about a
[1:14:45] tabernacle he's talking about you abely
[1:14:47] when a man possesses these kinds of
[1:14:49] thing I listen sometimes we talk about
[1:14:51] being
[1:14:52] possessed I don't mind it
[1:14:55] when it's a right
[1:14:57] possession when it's a holy ghost that
[1:14:59] possesses me not a ghost
[1:15:02] Hallelujah that don't make you happy
[1:15:04] when you got the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:15:06] you that'll make you happy I know we
[1:15:08] have bad days terrible days sometimes
[1:15:11] but something is going to light your
[1:15:14] face up something will it doesn't matter
[1:15:17] what a phone call a text message come on
[1:15:19] somebody somebody says we're praying for
[1:15:22] you I love you I got that heart in it's
[1:15:25] beating in on my on my uh WhatsApp you
[1:15:29] know that means
[1:15:30] something well it does mean something to
[1:15:33] me anyway hallu but until these virtues
[1:15:36] here go into you you're still now watch
[1:15:39] you're still off the real true
[1:15:41] foundation of
[1:15:43] faith I'm just reading quote but when
[1:15:46] these virtues grow in and you added that
[1:15:49] to that then you are a living Monument
[1:15:52] you are a living moving
[1:15:56] Idol why am I against organized religion
[1:16:00] and that's the way God does the church
[1:16:02] he beats every Creed every denomination
[1:16:05] every man-made Dogma until he sees his
[1:16:08] own life reflecting in you now what is
[1:16:11] he saying let me interpolate that he
[1:16:13] beats every false
[1:16:15] Doctrine
[1:16:16] amen every denominational
[1:16:20] idea ever something that you come up
[1:16:23] with or me amen come on every man made
[1:16:28] Dogma that comes from man didn't come
[1:16:29] from God until he sees his own life
[1:16:32] reflecting in you absolutely if I do not
[1:16:34] the works of my father believe me not
[1:16:37] see if what is purpose to the church now
[1:16:39] listen to this real quick if what is
[1:16:41] purpose to the church now what do you
[1:16:43] mean brother Ram it's a
[1:16:45] requirement it's purpose for us to be
[1:16:47] here today it's purpose for us to listen
[1:16:49] to the word of God it's purpose for us
[1:16:52] to know that God sent us a Malachi 4
[1:16:56] absolutely absolutely if what is
[1:16:59] purposed to the church the life that was
[1:17:01] in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't
[1:17:04] you stand
[1:17:05] still if you haven't got patience virtue
[1:17:09] all these things Temperance things
[1:17:11] godliness brotherly kindness and all
[1:17:12] these things now watch that's
[1:17:15] required of
[1:17:19] you I underline that required of you no
[1:17:24] matter what you done no matter how much
[1:17:25] You' shouted how many churches you've
[1:17:27] joined how many feathers you've pinned
[1:17:29] into
[1:17:31] yourself don't do it wait till genuinely
[1:17:35] from your heart you can forgive till in
[1:17:38] your heart you have brotherly kindness
[1:17:40] no matter if they pull a handful full of
[1:17:42] beard from one side you can turn the
[1:17:44] other cheek with sweetness until those
[1:17:47] virtues no matter what they say to you
[1:17:50] remembering the
[1:17:53] Lord if there's anything we're lacking
[1:17:56] let's do it I say the church today if
[1:17:58] there anything lacking let's do it let's
[1:18:00] find out what it is and let's do it if
[1:18:02] there's anything lacking with us let's
[1:18:05] get back to that restored let's remember
[1:18:09] what he
[1:18:11] required not what we think we ought to
[1:18:14] have but what he said we've got to have
[1:18:18] is that all right amen what was that in
[1:18:21] 1963 this was right before the seals
[1:18:23] were preached
[1:18:26] we got to have it that way the way that
[1:18:29] he said it the way he said it yes not
[1:18:34] the way we thought it the way he said
[1:18:36] it then talks about false Doctrine in
[1:18:39] Timothy Timothy says don't have anything
[1:18:41] to do with them if they teach any other
[1:18:43] Doctrine don't give heed to them if it
[1:18:45] ain't edifying don't worry about it
[1:18:47] don't don't even talk about
[1:18:49] it if any man Teach otherwise and
[1:18:51] consent not to Wholesome words even the
[1:18:53] words of our Lord and to the doctor
[1:18:54] which is according to God L he's proud
[1:18:56] not knowing nothing but doting about
[1:18:58] questions and Stripes of words I told
[1:19:01] y'all before couple weeks ago brother
[1:19:03] called me and and they um there's a um
[1:19:08] people on the internet now they're
[1:19:10] saying that brother brandham said he
[1:19:12] hated Cadillacs and never would own one
[1:19:14] and then now he owned one cuz somebody
[1:19:15] gave him one or
[1:19:21] then yeah let that sink in for a minute
[1:19:25] why are we worried about
[1:19:27] cars what did the man
[1:19:30] say he said what God said he actually
[1:19:35] picked up the mind of God and gave it to
[1:19:37] me and
[1:19:39] you I don't care if you don't didn't
[1:19:41] like potatoes I don't care if he didn't
[1:19:43] like corn or blah blah blah blah blah
[1:19:46] blah blah blah amen oh watch Charlie
[1:19:49] Brown every once in a while you hear
[1:19:51] that teacher going wow w wow w w w w
[1:19:53] well that's exactly what that is why
[1:19:56] there's no substance to
[1:19:58] it I told that brother I said why you
[1:20:01] even listening to
[1:20:02] that when I got to the first sentence
[1:20:06] I'd cut it off first sentence brother
[1:20:08] Ram said he'd never have a Cadillac now
[1:20:10] have a Cadillac but somebody gave him
[1:20:11] one and he and he took
[1:20:13] it beig
[1:20:17] whoppy but he's proud not knowing you
[1:20:19] know what it's lack of
[1:20:22] teaching it's lack of the new birth and
[1:20:25] any teaching in this message is why
[1:20:27] people are leaving right I'm
[1:20:29] sorry the lack of it you can preach on
[1:20:32] love and you can be happy and you can
[1:20:34] you can you know do the do the you know
[1:20:37] the wave and all that stuff but unless
[1:20:39] you're
[1:20:41] taught amen unless you're taught you
[1:20:45] what you're going to have strifeful
[1:20:46] words doting questions whereby cometh
[1:20:49] Envy Strife railing evil surmising
[1:20:52] perverse disputings of men of corrup up
[1:20:55] minds and destitute of the
[1:21:01] truth supposing that gain is godliness
[1:21:04] from such withdraw
[1:21:08] yourself so Paul tells us leaving the
[1:21:10] principles the doctrine of Christ we
[1:21:11] covered this the other day but let's
[1:21:13] just make sure we get it down pack let
[1:21:15] us go on into Perfection so Paul what we
[1:21:18] got we've got a foundation we're not
[1:21:20] going to do away with it just like God
[1:21:23] this is where I kind of went back read
[1:21:24] this and talks about look
[1:21:27] Foundation when God created this
[1:21:31] Earth he never meant for it to be
[1:21:34] annihilated that's
[1:21:38] right but man says see that's another
[1:21:41] Doctrine you go talk to denominational
[1:21:43] people they say oh god look he said he's
[1:21:45] going to destroy
[1:21:47] it he going to destroy every bit of this
[1:21:49] oh just to annihilate it we're going to
[1:21:52] go live in heaven
[1:21:54] where will that
[1:21:56] be see they don't even understand that
[1:22:00] heaven and Earth are going to be made
[1:22:02] new and we're going to come down from
[1:22:05] heaven on Earth and live on this Earth
[1:22:08] that was what restored by three
[1:22:12] processes
[1:22:13] right water blood and
[1:22:17] fire justification sanctification
[1:22:20] baptism Holy Ghost everybody know that
[1:22:21] justification Moses I'm not Moses Noah
[1:22:24] justification water baptism
[1:22:26] justification Justified but sat sin was
[1:22:28] still there come to sanctification Jesus
[1:22:31] Christ died on the cross he shed his
[1:22:32] blood it actually dripped on the Earth
[1:22:34] but what did it do it only saved his
[1:22:36] children it didn't save nobody else come
[1:22:39] on
[1:22:40] Amen but when you come to the fire of
[1:22:42] God that's where the separation comes
[1:22:44] amen only the
[1:22:47] bride now listen only a bride's going to
[1:22:50] survive any of
[1:22:52] that any of it
[1:22:55] we're caught away we're out of the way
[1:22:57] when God destroys all that but what's
[1:22:59] going to happen is he's just going to
[1:23:00] burn this thing off and we're going to
[1:23:02] just set right back down on top of
[1:23:04] it therefore leaving the principle of
[1:23:06] the doctrine of Christ let us go into
[1:23:07] Perfection not laying again the
[1:23:09] foundation of repentance in other words
[1:23:11] what's going to happen is when the new
[1:23:12] Heaven and new earth comes it's not
[1:23:14] going to be the
[1:23:16] same they not going to be beer joints
[1:23:18] and cars and all that no all that's gone
[1:23:23] passed away
[1:23:25] done away with just like what it was in
[1:23:27] the Garden of Eden I I picked up on
[1:23:29] something I'm not going to have time
[1:23:31] today but when you go back to the Christ
[1:23:33] the mystery of God revealed what did
[1:23:34] Brother R say he said all God was he
[1:23:36] poured into Christ all Christ was he
[1:23:38] poured into the church and then he added
[1:23:40] something take her back to that
[1:23:43] eden-like condition oh praise God thank
[1:23:46] God for a prophet that moved us through
[1:23:48] those things and told us where Christ
[1:23:51] was the Bible tells us in Matthew Jesus
[1:23:54] speak speaks and says hey they're going
[1:23:55] to tell you that Christ is over
[1:23:58] here don't go over there now why are you
[1:24:01] not going over there cuz you know where
[1:24:03] Christ is if you're just a Wandering
[1:24:06] Soul you don't know where Christ is
[1:24:07] today come on oh I know it's in the
[1:24:09] preacher it's in this it's
[1:24:12] in better be in you abolutely
[1:24:16] so all these things that we
[1:24:19] have are
[1:24:21] foundational things that we need to grow
[1:24:23] by amen all right so the doctrine has to
[1:24:27] be a required Doctrine to get us to that
[1:24:31] all right now
[1:24:35] look so what's happening now I want you
[1:24:37] to look look notice now everybody that
[1:24:39] realize Satan controls all political
[1:24:41] power of the world he said in Matthew 4
[1:24:45] all the kingdoms belong to him that's
[1:24:46] the reason they fight War kill now
[1:24:48] remember isn't that strange they were
[1:24:50] given this sword to kill one another
[1:24:51] he's talking about the second the seal
[1:24:53] all my notice when he did that he did
[1:24:55] not have the ecclesiastical power yet
[1:24:58] but he started in with a demon of a
[1:25:00] false
[1:25:02] teaching right demon of a false teaching
[1:25:08] Doctrine all right but what did that do
[1:25:12] if if you accept that you become it yeah
[1:25:17] I want to accept the truth and become
[1:25:20] it I want to accept the true doctrine of
[1:25:23] Christ and become it
[1:25:25] it not just accept it but become it am
[1:25:29] so what happened to them they became
[1:25:31] that false teaching now remember it was
[1:25:34] a do it was a
[1:25:36] saying it was a deed we'll get into it
[1:25:38] in the seals and then it became a
[1:25:40] Doctrine and then that Doctrine didn't
[1:25:43] stay there it became incarnate in a pope
[1:25:46] that's
[1:25:47] right listen right your life starts with
[1:25:51] a saying somebody told you about brother
[1:25:53] Rand somebody told you about Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ you might have not known nothing
[1:25:57] you just heard something a
[1:26:00] saying a deed you started coming to
[1:26:03] church you started doing trying to do
[1:26:04] the things huh then when you get born
[1:26:07] again what it become a Doctrine it
[1:26:09] become what you live
[1:26:12] by and then what that word's going to be
[1:26:15] incarnate in me and you listen the
[1:26:18] doctrine we have today is what's going
[1:26:20] to take us out of here amen nothing else
[1:26:23] there's not a new doctrine from another
[1:26:24] preacher or a new uh sermon coming or a
[1:26:28] new it's
[1:26:30] here it's just getting in it and
[1:26:33] becoming it he started with a false
[1:26:35] teaching that teaching became a doctrine
[1:26:38] that Doctrine became incarnate and a
[1:26:40] false prophet and then he went just to
[1:26:43] the right place he never went to Israel
[1:26:45] he went to Rome n see Rome Satan knows
[1:26:47] where to go that's why he's coming in
[1:26:50] this message and doing what he did he's
[1:26:53] trying to destroy this man message amen
[1:26:56] he's not worried about
[1:26:58] them he's got them amen he's worried
[1:27:01] about where the true teaching is cuz he
[1:27:04] wants to be the
[1:27:06] God of this evil
[1:27:08] age everybody with
[1:27:10] me where did the first Doctrine come
[1:27:13] from outside of the Bible you historians
[1:27:14] you know where it came from from Rome
[1:27:16] exactly where it started if you want to
[1:27:18] start an uproar you tell the Baptist
[1:27:20] that he believes everything the Catholic
[1:27:22] believes except a few things yeah go
[1:27:24] ahead you better do it from a distance
[1:27:27] amen cuz they'll fight you they they
[1:27:30] know that they know that the Catholic
[1:27:32] church is the old mother they say
[1:27:34] that that's right but they don't read
[1:27:36] the part where she had daughters that
[1:27:37] agree with the mama come on amen
[1:27:43] amen notice when they got back when
[1:27:45] these saints of God tried to hold up
[1:27:47] that word Rome came right in and
[1:27:49] accepted dogmas instead now let's just
[1:27:52] see what she did somewhere were fought
[1:27:54] teaching and we know what that was right
[1:27:55] the false teaching was all these
[1:27:57] different things all the we listed them
[1:28:00] all and we'll get into them but the
[1:28:01] doctrine that you and I are required to
[1:28:05] see
[1:28:06] is on Christ The Mystery of God
[1:28:09] reveal brother Brown said the church is
[1:28:11] the blood of Christ by the spirit
[1:28:14] because the life is in the blood so
[1:28:15] where's the Life of Christ that's in me
[1:28:17] and you all right is everybody with me
[1:28:19] so the last sent me and you and then by
[1:28:21] a three-fold manner we're coming back to
[1:28:23] restor ation by three-fold manner the
[1:28:25] words coming back in
[1:28:27] power amen justification sanctification
[1:28:30] baptism ghost listen when you get
[1:28:33] Justified come on you don't know a false
[1:28:35] doctor from a real one not yet come on
[1:28:38] you just you think that's good I I I
[1:28:43] found something I can attach myself to
[1:28:46] but now remember that demon is still
[1:28:49] there right all right everybody with me
[1:28:52] that demon is still there
[1:28:54] so what's he going to do he's going to
[1:28:56] try to attach hisself
[1:28:58] to come on he really ain't let go of you
[1:29:03] yet right if you're Justified you just
[1:29:05] get your sins chopped off same demon
[1:29:07] still there
[1:29:09] right then you got to move to
[1:29:10] sanctification yes sir where you start
[1:29:13] coming to church reading your Bible some
[1:29:14] of y'all ought to try
[1:29:16] that and doing trying to do brother
[1:29:18] Brown said you become a what he become a
[1:29:21] part of a religious order all right so
[1:29:23] there's a lot of people can be
[1:29:24] Sanctified but they're not
[1:29:27] bride amen they can be foolish virgin
[1:29:30] they can be given eternal life but
[1:29:31] they're not bride you're not bride until
[1:29:33] that unclean Spirit goes out of you and
[1:29:36] stays out of you yes and you're sealed
[1:29:38] in with God yes amen that's like listen
[1:29:42] before we close you take the Earth
[1:29:44] behold I give you a new Heaven and a new
[1:29:47] Earth behold today I give you a new
[1:29:50] Heaven and a new
[1:29:52] Earth you
[1:29:55] we're speaking a Heavenly language
[1:29:58] Heaven has come down to Earth come on
[1:30:01] somebody we're not trying to go to
[1:30:04] heaven right trying to get Heaven
[1:30:08] here and listen Paul tells us that if
[1:30:12] you're born again you're already living
[1:30:14] in Heavenly
[1:30:16] places in Christ Jesus you're already
[1:30:18] living not waiting you're already living
[1:30:21] in it now things are going to happen in
[1:30:24] life that's fine that's okay like I said
[1:30:27] before you know how to work through
[1:30:30] them the biggest support group you got
[1:30:32] don't worry about going to a
[1:30:34] psychiatrist I'm sorry if you go to one
[1:30:35] that's
[1:30:36] fine but talk to somebody's born
[1:30:39] again they'll have a lot more sense than
[1:30:41] some psychiatrist that ain't born again
[1:30:44] so they'll give you pills to take or
[1:30:46] something to watch or something to look
[1:30:47] at or something to do
[1:30:49] or Dr Jesus will tell
[1:30:52] you believe the word
[1:30:55] believe what I
[1:30:56] said I said you can do all things do
[1:31:01] Christ who strengthens
[1:31:02] you that there's nothing formed is going
[1:31:05] to bother you even though it raise up
[1:31:09] that there's nothing going to stop the
[1:31:11] bride from making it

[1:41:37] a way for you to be able to be required
[1:41:40] if that is even a word brother R made
[1:41:41] some up so I'm goingon to make some up
[1:41:43] but the communion message is telling us
[1:41:45] what there's something new
[1:41:48] coming out of something old CU brother
[1:41:50] listen Jesus was in the Old Testament
[1:41:55] the New Testament didn't happen until
[1:41:56] the death of the
[1:41:57] testator so he was prophesying there's
[1:42:00] something new coming that may just have
[1:42:02] been a few days but but he they had to
[1:42:04] wait when he resurrected another 40 or
[1:42:06] 50 days and then there was 11 days to
[1:42:08] Pentecost so there was a good bit of
[1:42:09] time he was prophesying there's
[1:42:11] something new coming amen but it's going
[1:42:14] to come out of the Old Testament it
[1:42:16] can't come any different Paul proved
[1:42:18] that by writing half of the of the or
[1:42:20] over half of the New Testament just
[1:42:23] using the Old Testament Scrolls now I'd
[1:42:25] love to been sitting there brother Bob
[1:42:27] with him and looking over his shoulder
[1:42:29] and him rolling them Scrolls back come
[1:42:32] on and he's sitting there reading it as
[1:42:34] a Jew and he's reading it and he
[1:42:37] stops and he starts
[1:42:39] writing he keeps reading he keeps
[1:42:42] reading about Isaiah and Jeremiah and
[1:42:44] all one he stops and starts writing what
[1:42:47] God put something in his mind God saying
[1:42:50] this is what I meant right here and when
[1:42:52] these people get the Holy Ghost this is
[1:42:54] what they're going to see they're going
[1:42:55] to see you writing this and them reading
[1:42:58] it and then we're going to see the god
[1:42:59] of the Old Testament and the New
[1:43:00] Testament remember brother R said he
[1:43:02] thought the Old Testament Jesus hated
[1:43:04] him or God hated him and then Jesus
[1:43:06] loved him and he said I found out the
[1:43:07] same person he was just reading through
[1:43:09] different eyes so let's all read through
[1:43:11] different
[1:43:12] eyes for I have received of the Lord
[1:43:14] that which I also delivered unto you
[1:43:16] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:43:18] which he was betrayed took bread when he
[1:43:20] had given thanks he break it and said
[1:43:22] take eat this is my body body which is
[1:43:23] broken for you look this do in
[1:43:26] remembrance of
[1:43:28] me after the same manner also he took
[1:43:31] the cup and when he had up saying this
[1:43:32] Testament is the New Testament in his
[1:43:35] blood not the blood of the ghats that's
[1:43:38] right he identified it in my blood and
[1:43:41] I'm sure they were
[1:43:43] going they still didn't know what was
[1:43:45] going
[1:43:46] on CU they were I mean they were Jews
[1:43:49] goat sacrifices and animals and all that
[1:43:52] and he's saying this is something new in
[1:43:54] my
[1:43:55] blood but now I'm telling you on the day
[1:43:57] of Pentecost that
[1:44:00] quickened in their heart amen that right
[1:44:03] there quickened in their heart this is
[1:44:05] what Jesus was talking about right here
[1:44:09] that this do you as often as you drink
[1:44:10] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:44:12] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:44:14] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:44:16] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:44:19] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:44:21] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:44:22] and blood love of the Lord but let a man
[1:44:24] examine himself there is a way to get
[1:44:27] right let a man examine himself and so
[1:44:29] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:44:31] that cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:44:33] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:44:35] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:44:38] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:44:40] sickly among you and
[1:44:42] many fall
[1:44:44] asleep for if we would judge ourselves
[1:44:46] we should not be judged but when we are
[1:44:48] judged we are chasen of the Lord that we
[1:44:50] should not be condemned with the world
[1:44:52] praise God
[1:44:53] God we will not stand the Judgment of
[1:44:56] this world if you're born again it's
[1:44:59] passed away it's passed you passed from
[1:45:01] Death un life amen wherefore my brethren
[1:45:03] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:45:05] for another if any in hunger let him
[1:45:07] meat at home that you come not together
[1:45:08] under condemnation the rest will I set
[1:45:10] in order when I
[1:45:13] come what a
[1:45:16] great it's just an
[1:45:19] honor that Paul wrote this in
[1:45:22] Corinthians
[1:45:23] wasn't even there so it was wrote by the
[1:45:25] holy spirit so it's exactly the way God
[1:45:27] wanted us to hear it in the end time
[1:45:29] amen or even down Through the Ages
[1:45:31] that's the way he want us to hear not
[1:45:32] Peter's
[1:45:33] version not John's version a
[1:45:37] prophets yes hearing from the mind of
[1:45:40] God picking up the mind of
[1:45:42] God Amen I wasn't there but this is what
[1:45:46] happened praise God for Revelation see
[1:45:48] there's prophetic people reading a
[1:45:51] prophetic message and that's me you we
[1:45:53] get the between the
[1:45:57] lines Bible said he took bread and
[1:45:59] blessed it dear heavenly father Lord
[1:46:01] this has been made Lord the way it's
[1:46:02] supposed to be with holy hands father
[1:46:05] Lord with nothing added father just
[1:46:07] something that that we have to put to
[1:46:09] cook father just like you did there at
[1:46:11] that night and I pray Lord that you
[1:46:12] would touch each one of us Lord and
[1:46:14] bless each one as we partake in Jesus
[1:46:16] name amen
[1:46:26] and Paul the way he instructed all
[1:46:28] that it was for a group of of people
[1:46:31] that they didn't know any better
[1:46:33] Corinthians they just ate and drank all
[1:46:35] the time right so he was catching them
[1:46:39] or not catching them but he was saying
[1:46:40] well they're we're having the Lord's
[1:46:41] supper tonight well they go and they'll
[1:46:43] eat fish and uh probably some lamb and
[1:46:47] some potatoes and all and and then they
[1:46:49] would drink right and Paul said wait a
[1:46:53] minute this is not the Lord's Supper
[1:46:55] this is your
[1:46:57] supper the Lord's Supper is to be
[1:47:00] taken with
[1:47:02] sorrow but
[1:47:06] happiness there's a man did this for
[1:47:09] us and he said do this till I
[1:47:14] come I I you know I just don't I don't
[1:47:17] understand how a Christian can get by
[1:47:20] without taking communion I just don't
[1:47:22] see how that's can happen I don't
[1:47:24] because it's an ordinance it's something
[1:47:26] it's a required Doctrine de Heavenly
[1:47:29] Father Lord thank you for this wine it
[1:47:31] was made a year ago now father and it's
[1:47:33] just getting better with age father just
[1:47:35] like your word father and Lord as we
[1:47:37] partake of it may we remember you father
[1:47:40] and remember that night when you lifted
[1:47:41] that cup this you said this is something
[1:47:43] new this is something you're not going
[1:47:45] to understand now but you will
[1:47:47] understand later and father you gave us
[1:47:49] that comforter you gave us the one the
[1:47:51] guide by the Holy Ghost goes to tell us
[1:47:53] what this is all about father just bless
[1:47:55] each person as they partake in Jesus
[1:47:57] name
[1:48:01] amen you know he he had uh when he got
[1:48:05] up there to the upper room he knew what
[1:48:08] was coming he knew at that time what was
[1:48:11] going to
[1:48:14] happen but the prophet of God said he
[1:48:17] had to go to
[1:48:18] Gethsemane he had to go to the Garden he
[1:48:20] said that's where he fought it out
[1:48:24] have you had your Gethsemane
[1:48:26] yet he told us to Bear a
[1:48:28] cross but we don't have to hang on it
[1:48:31] but we have a cross to
[1:48:33] bear but we don't have to die like he
[1:48:36] died right we don't have to we're not
[1:48:39] going to he's been crucified one time oh
[1:48:42] the world crucified him
[1:48:43] absolutely and put him to an open shame
[1:48:46] because of the indictment brother Rand
[1:48:47] BR is what they're doing is is they're
[1:48:49] taking the word of God and making it of
[1:48:51] none effect to the people that happened
[1:48:54] when Jesus was alive he looked at the
[1:48:57] denominational world or looked at the
[1:48:59] the Christians of the world supposedly
[1:49:01] and he said by your Traditions you've
[1:49:03] made the word of God of none effect to
[1:49:04] the people in other words they can't get
[1:49:06] any healing or salvation or not
[1:49:08] salvation but they can't get any healing
[1:49:09] or can't get anything relief because
[1:49:12] you've just done what same way they did
[1:49:14] it at um at NAA they added all these
[1:49:17] other things because what did Jesus say
[1:49:19] by your Traditions he didn't say by the
[1:49:21] word he said by your Traditions the
[1:49:24] traditions of man you've made this
[1:49:26] doctrine of none effect to the people
[1:49:29] but now I
[1:49:30] believe I believe brother boy it's
[1:49:33] become to be affected it's affecting a
[1:49:36] group of
[1:49:38] people and I hope it infects
[1:49:41] us CU if it infects us it's in us I want
[1:49:45] it to affect everything we
[1:49:47] do everything we think about sure listen
[1:49:51] there's one man standing this pull pit
[1:49:53] that knows we live a human life more
[1:49:55] than we live a Christian
[1:49:56] Life oh don't get don't get don't get
[1:50:00] all self-righteous on me we have to
[1:50:03] worry about
[1:50:05] bills kids car wife
[1:50:10] husband I was thinking about that this
[1:50:11] today where Paul said it's better to
[1:50:15] marry than to burn but if you cannot
[1:50:16] marry he said it'd be good to do that
[1:50:18] why because if you marry what' he say he
[1:50:20] said you got to take care of your wife
[1:50:22] you got to make her happy you got he
[1:50:23] always said that about the wife you got
[1:50:24] to make the wife happy happy wife happy
[1:50:27] life but you got in other words you do
[1:50:29] you have these different things you got
[1:50:30] to to worry about we are human beings
[1:50:32] we're still here like June she she'd Lov
[1:50:35] to been
[1:50:36] here but that's her
[1:50:39] blood and and I'm sure knowing my wife
[1:50:42] she done laid hands on
[1:50:44] her she's already laid hands on Ain't No
[1:50:48] Doubt so you
[1:50:51] see we do live a Christian life but we
[1:50:54] do live a human life and we do make
[1:50:58] mistakes but what what did Brother
[1:51:00] around tell us the mark of a true
[1:51:02] Christian
[1:51:04] was oh that we don't make no mistakes
[1:51:07] that's not what he
[1:51:09] said he said the mark of a true
[1:51:11] Christian if he falls
[1:51:14] down he gets back up and continues
[1:51:18] on that's the mark of a true Christian
[1:51:22] we're going to fight a lot of
[1:51:25] battles but the Victory Is Ours through
[1:51:28] Jesus nobody else is going to do
[1:51:31] it the Holy Ghost inside of you is going
[1:51:34] to lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:51:36] not the Holy Ghost inside of me is going
[1:51:37] to lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:51:38] the Holy Ghost inside of you is going to
[1:51:40] do
[1:51:43] it as we were talking before I think the
[1:51:46] B touched on it we're not and you see it
[1:51:50] and and it it's it comes from a spirit
[1:51:54] because it's not come from God because
[1:51:55] when God tells us
[1:51:59] um to be humble we'd be humble right and
[1:52:03] then there are times when you have to
[1:52:06] correct but don't let the devil beat you
[1:52:08] so much till he beats you down because
[1:52:10] there's victory in what you just went
[1:52:12] through everybody with me yes do you
[1:52:15] hear me that's why I said Christians
[1:52:16] have Victory not ever defeat oh they're
[1:52:19] defeated no they just never was a
[1:52:21] Christian
[1:52:22] you see people leave like brother Brown
[1:52:25] was talking about different one talking
[1:52:26] about people leaving well they never had
[1:52:28] that
[1:52:29] toost if you got that toost you listen
[1:52:32] you going to have problems heartaches
[1:52:34] trials but look to God he promised us
[1:52:38] we'd make
[1:52:40] it and if we fall get back
[1:52:44] up get back up and go again I yes sir
[1:52:48] I'd rather have somebody do
[1:52:50] that he didn't say be perfect remember
[1:52:53] he sure he said be therefore perfect I
[1:52:54] understand
[1:52:56] that are
[1:52:58] complete but we're still Christian I
[1:53:00] we're still Christians and we and living
[1:53:01] in a human
[1:53:03] body but one
[1:53:07] day you'll overcome
[1:53:09] it God will do it through you you will
[1:53:13] be an overcomer when God changes your
[1:53:16] body I don't care if we have to go by
[1:53:18] the grave or if we're standing right
[1:53:20] here God's going to do it through you
[1:53:22] amen but let's look to the author and
[1:53:24] finish of our faith let's look to the
[1:53:26] god that says I've got a a new testament
[1:53:28] coming there there's a there's a a a new
[1:53:32] commandment that's what Jesus
[1:53:35] said there's not a new word but there's
[1:53:37] a new word are a new ministry as brother
[1:53:40] R was talking about so we're going to
[1:53:42] transform into that with the third pull
[1:53:44] and all the different things preaching
[1:53:45] of the the seals and all that but you
[1:53:48] just pray that God give you Revelation
[1:53:50] you pray that God would put in
[1:53:51] somebody's
[1:53:54] mouth we're just
[1:53:58] servants come
[1:53:59] on not not Warlords or or or Lords over
[1:54:03] you you got one Lord he don't make
[1:54:06] mistake but he gave a five-fold Ministry
[1:54:08] to help you along yes and pray that God
[1:54:11] will put it in somebody's mind to look
[1:54:14] at on the word of God and put it on
[1:54:15] print and preach it to
[1:54:18] you that's my prayer and it doesn't
[1:54:21] matter who it is if a God sent person it
[1:54:23] don't matter amen let's take
[1:54:34] communion thank you
[1:54:42] Lord the Bible tells us that
[1:54:45] after suppers
[1:54:48] ended what' he do say now all y'all wash
[1:54:51] my feet did
[1:54:55] he they probably didn't even know what
[1:54:57] he was doing until he started doing what
[1:54:59] he was doing supper being ended the
[1:55:01] devil having now put in the heart of
[1:55:02] Judas to carry it Simon's son to betray
[1:55:05] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:55:07] given all things into his hands and that
[1:55:09] he was come from God and went to God he
[1:55:11] rises from supper laid aside His Garment
[1:55:14] took a towel and GED
[1:55:17] himself after that he poured water in
[1:55:20] the basin
[1:55:22] and began to wash feet and to WIP them
[1:55:24] with a towel where withth he was gted
[1:55:27] then cometh he to Simon Peter Peter said
[1:55:29] Lord thus thou wash my feet oh Peter
[1:55:33] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:55:35] do thou knowest not
[1:55:37] now but Thou shalt know
[1:55:41] Hereafter Peter sath unto him Thou shalt
[1:55:43] never wash my feet Jesus answered and
[1:55:45] said if I wash thee not thou Hast no
[1:55:47] part with me Simon Peter said unto him
[1:55:51] Lord not my feet only but my hands and
[1:55:53] my head Jesus said to him he that is
[1:55:56] washed NE is not saved to wash his feet
[1:55:58] but is clean every with and you are
[1:55:59] clean but not all for he knew who should
[1:56:01] betray him therefore he said you are not
[1:56:03] all clean so after he had washed their
[1:56:06] feet and taken the Garment sat down and
[1:56:08] he said unto them know you what I've
[1:56:10] done to you asking a question do youall
[1:56:11] know what I just did you call me master
[1:56:13] and Lord and you say well for so I am if

[1:56:43] we're all down here you ought also to
[1:56:45] wash one another's feet that's just the

[1:56:49] human flesh can kneel down and wash
[1:56:52] Dirty
