listen to what I say cuz God's going to speak to you today it becom my lot for you to listen to the word of God through these ministers that's all way we're going to get it through the foolishness of preaching are we going to get out of here because that's what God promised he said he gave some Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for what perfecting of the Saints not to get you just a little bit not to perfect you and that we all come together in the unity of the faith how are we going to know what the unity is if somebody doesn't tell us cuz Satan will give you his version of unity the Baptist will give their you you you know their version of unity and and the world will give you uh you know the world United now under whatever you want to be rainbow you choose it you know you you don't even have to choose your gender until you're five or six years old you know and then you decide who you are how weird is that Sodom and Gomorrah right all over again just debauchery on every hand F to the world but you know what we used to be a religious Nation but the prophet of God told us in 1956 that the United States turned God down C he doesn't even pray for the United States anymore yeah that's what he said I pray for the people in it and the people that that are that are getting caught up in this system of of um of what's going on in the world the politics and all the things you see the wars and rumors of wars but didn't the Bible tell us this is what was going to happen it's not something that we uh many times before I've told you you go talk to people out in the world uh even a nominal Christian they don't exactly know what's going on they think maybe this is the Antichrist or the number uh tattoo are are we're going to have seven years of tribulation or like um like Sister Christine back there you know they put that movie out um Left Behind well now there's left behind two how you going to get left behind twice I mean what right so I mean how's it going to happen how I ain't going to get left behind the first time so I ain't going to worry about that but the world will they'll be deceived and fooled and they'll get left behind and they'll still think brother Bram said he said they'll still think they're getting saved that anointing will be so strong from the devil till the people will think they're still getting healed they're still getting saved and he said too late then all right so let's go to the lord well let's let's get these announcements out of the way oh if whatever we're doing what we're doing with Sister Barbara Sister Barbara needs that email that she's been talking to y'all about and if you look at me kind of strange go talk to brother Sister Barbara but she needs to have that she's looking at done in about a week so most of you all of you know what I'm talking about if you don't ask your neighbor but don't ask a certain neighbor what's going on so anyway so not to be exclusive but y'all know what I'm talking about it'll be wonderful we got a lot of things going on uh remember brother Bob brother Aaron all them brother Lis will be speaking Wednesday night U remember next Saturday we will have Bible study at 6:00 to 8 and we will have a prayer meeting from 5: to 6:00 so if you want to come a little bit early and come in here and pray a music will be on no talking no fellowshipping you come in here to pray we'll Fellowship downstairs and we'll do questions and answers from 6:00 to 8 on Saturday and then brother Dutch Scott will be here the next Friday speaking for us on that Friday evening April the 8th at 3:00 we'll have a fellowship meeting brother Chris long will be here with us and then also on the 9th brother Chris will be with us and that will be Easter Sunday so we'll keep those things in our prayers and we have several other meetings coming up some in July we have some brothers coming to speak for us and I really appreciate the five-fold ministry that we can listen to to the word of God and you don't have to listen to me or some around here you know brother B said don't let this get common though don't let it be common don't let it be a common religion don't let it be oh that's just brother Ry no it might be God speaking to you and you might miss your hour of visitation so let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this time you give us thank you for this day that we're living in thank you for the word of God thank you for giving us even a chance just a chance to have eternal life just an opportunity for us then to have this message placed in our laps the greatest message since the Lord Jesus youself yourself came on the earth is laying in our laps today and Father what are we going to do with it are we going to let it just slip through our fingers as sand or are we going to hang on to it hold on to it Pour it in ourself so that we can be more like you this world from the beginning of time has been waiting on that at Adam and Eve condition before the fall where there is complete control with a human being with their soul Eternal and there be no sin well that's what we're heading to and the plan that you give us seemed like it was marred and seemed like it was you were going to have to go back to the drawing board as they say but no everything falls right into place because Lord your plan and purpose is perfect you knew what you were doing now Lord you continue to know what you're doing you've not lost anything you'll not lose anyone father everything that's part of this plan you saw before the foundation of the world by knowledge and you saw us even right here today standing right here today at this very moment you saw this in your mind just as Vivid as is it as it's happening right now and Lord I pray that you be well pleased with us here today and the hearers and the speakers father I pray that You' just bless each one Lord that's on the highways a lot of them are coming back today brother Aaron Brother Bob brother Boyds and brother um Gary and different ones Lord they traveling back brother Michael all those Lord that are coming back from South Carolina Lord I pray that you'd be with them Lord on the highways bring them back together Lord in you father be with ones that are sick Lord sister Freda there with her kidneys hurting Lord we stopped and prayed there middle uh 1:00 or whatever it was Lord I pray that you would just bless her Lord just rain down blessings upon our sister and father may she feel like it and just feel absolutely wet with the saturation of the Holy Ghost Lord that rain that falls that sometimes we feel it ourself even that little tingle that feeling of of beautiful rain drops falling on our head Lord that's the healing power of the Lord Jesus Lord I pray that should be with every one of the other ones that are sick too not leaving anyone out that we'll all get the blessing Lord even the ones here in the building today Father rejuvenate us Lord there's times Lord that we feel some sometimes sure enough about not wanting to get out of bed to do anything but father we get up and when we put our feet on the floor we say thank you Lord thank you Jesus we put our feet on the floor and as a prophet of God says many times I've I've chuckled when he says when you put when a Believer puts their feet on the floor all devils in Hell tremble well sometimes we don't feel like that Lord when we're first getting out of bed we feel like that we can't move a muscle but father somewhere deep down inside that inside of the inside man there's something going on in a supernatural world that surely the demons are shaken and Lord I pray that each one of us will have that anointing today to drive that demon of whatever it is away from us and completely out of the building father give us this day our daily bread and be with us in Jesus name amen yeah I kind of chuckle sometimes when you get out of bed you put your feet on the floor and you go oh man all devils in hell are trembling I can't hardly get out of bed but I'm going to believe what that Prophet said in a supernatural Realm we're waking up right and he's not gone boys and girls he's right there with us so I just want him to know next time you put your feet on the ground say Satan here I come this is how you're going to be defeated whether I look like it or not amen he's defeated he's already defeated how's he going to be defeated through the Bride of Jesus Christ so let's start here again now this is part 97 we're heading toward 100 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth second Peter 1 and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness I hope we get to that today in your patience Luke says this is Jesus telling us in your patience possess ye your souls you know somebody's in control is patient right somebody's in control is patient cuz you we go Haywire that's not being patient and usually what happens we goof up we do like brother Brown we go out past the plan of God or we we even go out go out to past the plan of us our day like brother John we go out and say oh man should have done that you you know well there's a do over you can do over you're good we just back up and and let's remember that that how many times have you we were talking about crop pots and and microwave you know you go into the house and and uh we used to and even when we hunt we like to put U potatoes and carrots and roast in a crock pot turn it on low and then go out and do our business and hunt and do whatever and then when we come back oh the smell oh it smells so good that thing's been cooking the whole time but then you get some you look in the potatoes are a little bit hard what's the first thing you do throw them in the microwave well that's the same way with us we want to have a religion that is a crock pot religion but sometimes we look over there and we see that microwave sitting over there and we like to throw stuff in it and what happens if you put something in a microwave and get it too hot it explodes and you have a mess everywhere amen and most time you sisters have to clean it up 1 Timothy 3:16 Says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh right now amen justified in the spirit right now seen of angels you I can't see but you know what they can it says seen of angels it doesn't say see Angels so the angels that are encamped about us today they're looking into this Dimension seeing us and they're going come on we can't do anything without you we're just standing here at attention you know you you you ask and we come preached unto the Gentiles happening right now believed on in the world right now received up into Glory we're heading in that direction am man you can be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word we were talking this morning about the plan and purpose of God I want you to understand there's no other way that's what was getting trying to get in my head the other day there's no other way we cannot start and and have our own plan the plan's got to be the plan and purpose of God and man until and I just say this boldly until the prophet of God came in this end time man did not know the complete plan of God they did not know the complete Plan of Redemption or maybe they had a a thought of it or they thought this was right or they thought that was right they thought father son Holy Ghost was the way to be baptized they thought that there was an eternal hell they thought that there was three gods or three persons in a godhead they thought all these things but when the prophet of God come he brought that plan and purpose of God and he says this is it and you know what God Vindicated that it was it there's no other there's nothing other than this you say boy that's real bold I listen I stake my soul on this right here right that's right you say yeah I do he brought me to Christ and brought more than the denominations brought me than the world brought me than the different ones that had their ideas brought me the prophet of God brought I don't care if he didn't do what they said he did and he was not in Arizona and he didn't shoot this and he didn't kill that I don't care he took us to God Amen and he took the plan brought the right plan here on to us now to the world it's to us today that's right it's not to the world it could be listen it could be we're not we're not exclusive God says we're exclusive right God says if you're my bride this is what you're going to get it's like we were talking about this morning there's a group inside of a group there's groups inside of groups because listen Paul even stands up one day and he says not all Israel is Israel not all bride is bride brother Brown said there's been Brides brides churches Brides churches and he makes this long uh sentence about that he said but there'll come one one one true bride that will not get out of line she will stand in Step she will catch the mind of God see that's why I believe that's what brother R's job was he was to bring us and and give us the mind of God and then we decide whether we take it or not right that's what he was doing to the denominational world he said here this is the truth I'm not going to shove it down your throat but I'm bringing you the truth God's vindicating it every night by giving us signs and wonders and if you don't take it I can't make you right right I think I have a quote in here or or maybe for later where brother Bown says says I come here every year said you Pentecost to women you still cut your hair you still wear makeup you still wear pants he said it's not doing you he said it's doing some good but it's not doing what what brother Brown and I've always said this brother Brown did not destroy one denomination as much as he preached against them as much as he told them they were of the Harlot system they ain't a what said okay we don't want to be Baptist no more we just going to completely do away with that denomination we're all going to be message Believers no what there was 969 when he was here there's 13,000 different denom ations in the world now so guess what Satan just kept on going but there's a group of people there's a group of people inside a group of people that's going to take this message as the prophet said and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord that's going to what that's going to walk with God and be not one day but you're not going to do it we're not going to do it halfway amen I that's just a plan I'm sorry I didn't make it I'm just here to enforce it right that's what we are we're not here we're like deacons deacons don't make the rules they enforce the rules so that's why we're here we're here not to make the rules but to enforce them to give them to you and you know what there's a law of speeding out here right now right there's a law of drinking alcohol and if you drink you know you du want Dr or Dr drink while you're driving right did that stop people from doing it course full of people that drink and drive that drive over the speed limit it hasn't stopped anything but it has stop the ones that it needs to stop and those of us that don't drink doesn't matter anyway amen if you ever worried about a DUI Law being changed why don't apply to you same way with these things in the Bible we can do away with a lot of our problems if we'll get into this not makeing make it a law but make it Grace hello somebody come on I I don't worry about whether they're passing laws whether I can drink and and two beers now instead of four or or why oh lord they're going to start closing the beer joints at 10:00 oh my word so what you ought to close them and down but does that bother you it shouldn't bother you things like that should bother no shouldn't bother people out in the world but it does cuz why do they make the law cuz there's somebody there listen this is kind of funny but if you look on these things that you buy especially lawnmowers you buy a lawnmower and there's a little thing right down here with a man with his hand in the blade right that says do not put your hand right here guess why that sticker's there some man put his hand hand underneath there while it was going right cuz somebody did it well that's why God's got things in the Bible cuz he knows people are going to do it but he's also going to know there people that won't ever do it amen so that's why I take Grace I see that I see the law part of it but but brother brownon preached the sermon Church choosing law for Grace they chose the law when they should have took all this as Grace cuz the grace to me is though if I do I'm not going to ask how many has had a speeding ticket in the past several months I haven't but but if you did then you get Grace why you have to go pay a penalty though I mean you go have to pay a fine but there is Grace there they don't just take you out and hang you on hang you up in a tree no there's a law that covers that same way in the Bible there's Grace that covers you if you do something wrong cuz Christians do things wrong sorry to let y'all in on that if you got a problem send email Sister Barbara Jesus died for one purpose that was to save those who God forign knew let me give you a little let me give you a little um a little snippet here that that helps me a lot because a lot of people confuse that when you talk about for knowledge predestination in the message is it's like even brother brandham he said you know what he said predestination is a a bad word to use well it's still a bad word to use if you don't know what you're doing all right you got to make it by forn knowledge the Bible says those who he forew he did predestinate so what comes first for knowledge he forew therefore he could predetermine that you were going to have a seed or a word that was put aside for you right at the time of your new birth but not something you going have from the time of your natural birth right everybody with me but God forew that so brother could say in the mind of God if you if you have that eternal life you always was eternal not you that I'm looking at but you that's inside of you is what I'm looking at that thing never had a beginning or am cuz if it had a beginning it will definitely have an end all right so to me for knowledge is the most simple thing to explain but it's the most hard thing for people to understand so we we know one thing for sure brother D been preaching predestination that's probably one of his one of his favorite topics but it all comes by for knowledge so four for f o r e for no so those he fornew he predestinated so he could see what's going on and he see the choice you made right good or bad he saw the choice you made and and he saw he even saw you never make another one cuz see you can't he can't see us choose to have eternal life and he impart it to us and then see that on down the road even brother BR said God's not an Indian giver he's not going to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you're going to mess up so bad he's going to take it away from you that's why he says he he said I think it's a church AG book he said I want to settle this in security about security I believe in eternal security if you believe it like he believes it and I believe it but not like the Baptist believe it once saved always saved I mean man you in the Baptist Church you shake a hand you give you know you make a decision they say and you don't have to go to church the rest of your life you can drink smoke cuss you can do whatever you want to do but now when they bury you you got it cuz back you know 50 something years ago you made a decision well that's not true we know that but eternal security is is one saved always saved if you get born again you get born again you can't get unborn again you get born again you are what sealed to the day of your Redemption sealed to the day of your Redemption everybody with me on this I'm going to keep you awake God knew there was going to be somebody saved or he knew he [Music] forne therefore if you know what's going to happen tomorrow if you know for a fight let me tell you something El I hope the Rapture takes place on Sunday cuz all the demons are getting ready for Monday and they're going I got them I'm going to make that tire flat before they get them to go to work I'm going to make them late I'm going to make them sick on Monday and we going to be going later devil we going to disappear before Monday happens amen may do y'all like Mondays I do not like Mondays Mondays at the post office is heck you've got two days worth of mail you got to deliver and two days worth of y'all's packages that y'all ordered basically they're on Herbert seer's road several on Herber siger's road that I'm looking at now and that are not here but I Don't Like Mondays I just don't like them cuz it's it you you you come out of today you got you got just a wonderful anointing you know and and and we go downstairs or we go eat or we go talk about the word of the Lord and how good he was or good he was today and how good he is in then in the morning like I said you wake up your car won't start the alarm clock won't go off you just laid all week just messes everything up but let's make Sundays let's make Mondays Sundays now let's let's when we get up put our feet on the ground tomorrow let's just remember God is with us today as much as he was Sunday all right so you say that to yourself so there had to be a preparation or a way made for them to be saved so see there's a there's a way or a plan that God has and what we have to do is is connect ourself to that plan all right God's not going to make us and force us but he's going to make it so available that we can accept it or reject it so available but he knows who's going to and who's not therefore his plan now look our plan is just like all over the board messed up we can go a hundred different directions but God's plan is he's got one drawing and he knows exactly what's going on all the way down through here we don't but see so according to his plan and purpose he can do these things and he can tell you know he said well they're going to pray about this but they're not going to pray about so much about this they're going to go ahead and make this mistake God can't make you not make that mistake if he saw you make it to begin with all right but he did see as brother B says many times he said he did see you get down on your knees and say God forgive me you know Satan comes up and says hey you see what they did hey you see what they did and and the Lord says no I didn't see it but I can hear their voice they says forgive me Lord for what I'm doing look if there wasn't in other words there wasn't a plan salvation wasn't possible we can just go home eat drink and be married so God for knowing that people would be saved let me say this too for knowing that we would want more that we would want more of God that we would want more than just coming to church reading our Bible that we would want to be the word made flesh amen amen knowing who they were he had to lay a plan down so now in order to be God he had to know who will do it or he wasn't God cuz he's omnipotent I'm presentent omnicient he knows everything he's at every place all powerful so for knowledge looks back and says that he for saw this so he saw it and knows that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning how could he write a Bible if he didn't know what the beginning was and didn't know what the end was he wrote the Bible amen right man didn't write it man pinned it but he didn't write it God wrote the Bible and knows that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning and therefore knowing that all these marvelous days that we're living in now and stand to witness and see the things that we've seen now God had to make a preparation for it in other words Paul or Peter sits in in in second Peter and he writes this and pin it to the church everybody with me all right stay with me for a minute he pin that to the church right add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience in other words that you'll be what in other words you'll be you'll be a complete person and then through the church ages though you see brother brandham he he says he says a lot of that gets laate down cuz even Jude tells that we're to contend for that faith that was once delivered to the Saints so it hadn't been delivered even in Wesley's day even in Luther's day that Faith now Faith was delivered but not that one not that faith of the fathers the faith was delivered but like I said before I read it to you several times faith alone won't do it in the end time faith alone will not do it you can have all Faith Paul says know all Mysteries and not have what not have the Holy Ghost in your soul many people that are leaving the message are proving that they never had charity in their soul they never had the new birth you can't leave this message and have the new birth you can be confused but you can't leave this message and say it's no good that brother Brown wrong that he's you know this and that you can't do that you know what if you believe you can do that you're going to get caught in too if you believe that you're going to get caught in it too but if you've got charity you will not fall from this message amen you might fall down flat on your face and have and and and make mistakes and sin but you'll never leave this message because this is the love of God to a group of people that don't even deserve it if you think you deserve this message you need to hit the altar nope you don't deserve none of this think about that but God seeing that you wanted it more than your neighbor did why' your neighbor not get it he didn't want as more as you as much as you did he saw you keep punching and keep punching keep going keep striving in other words like I said before this is the battle it's not picnic the purpose of the Holy Ghost the father God the Father dwelling in you working out his plans how many times you look up the word plan brother R talks about PL so God did have a plan and we got to get in that plan we can't go around it we can't be where we say well I don't think that'll now how can you tell God I don't think that'll work that's right it will work you just don't want to put yourself in it working out his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption working where through you making you a coworker with him I wish you could see that coworker with him HS and join HS with Christ whatever Christ gets you get the problem is is we maybe don't want a lot of the things that uh it cost too much for us to give up this part of our life Pride somebody had it written down a piece I think something Deany did pride and the Bible says pride comes before fall right Pride we're too pride is we we don't we don't we don't want to do exactly that I want to have some knowledge but I want my own listen yesterday or Friday when Micah and Esther got married she gave up everything she had she gave up her name she is not a black anymore she's not a pure woman anymore understand what I'm talking about she's give herself completely to Micah laid everything on his shoulders and said you got to take care of me according to the holy vows sickness and in health good times and bad times credit debt cash did y'all have any money fights oh come on now Alisa is just smiling John's going we all do we all do we all have money fights well I said well never mind let's keep going but I want you to see this this is what struck me because look do we have the Holy Ghost to hunt for lost souls you said brother way you're preaching on statute per man that's above it well if we if we lose that that we're above trying to get people into the into the fold or getting people born again we've lost the very foundation of the plan and we have to go back and reach back thank God he reached down and got me and you and now he's reaching back in case we are slipping and falling and by pre the foolishness of preaching he's trying to bring us all up at the same time we're not all going to come at the same time but you know what don't leave me behind Lord don't leave me behind but you got to make yourself available in the plan right cuz what a Satan do he says well no that's not the plan here's the plan when it strikes into the heart and takes us abod there's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls wow that's what's the matter with the meetings today there's not enough Spirit touch in it to go for the souls of the Lost and the dying it's more to make a name or a church or a building or a denomination instead of a soul winning program how pitiful I hope this church never gets to where it's us for no more and we're done and I don't want no more in and I you know we're no I why I pray for your kids my kids amen your spouses your moms your dads call their names all every night it may be redundant but I'm old and to keep from forgetting I have a list that I go by every night try not to forget anybody now God's secret mystery I'm glad you said Thank you nobody else did I want to thank you all dad pray for us he gets up all night and praise mom too what brother what did Brother Dell tell brother Al brother Al said brother Dell I couldn't go to sleep last night he said so I prayed for you and he or he said I went then went to sleep brother Dell said Lord wake him up let him pray for me again now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it now what was his motive to bring us back to an Eden condition now to bring us back to an Eden condition what was Adam Adam was standing there the Son of God but he was the first Adam he had these virtues and the head but he was missing a piece he wasn't a redeemer but he had headship over this Earth he controlled this whole earth and Eve was right there with him right so he had headship now see we don't have headship over this Earth we need to have headship over this one first right but he had headship over the whole world I mean he could just go like brother bar said he go tree move over there I don't like you over there Eve says oh it's a little too cool today well let's turn the let's turn the heat up now how many of us have done that before yeah that's what I mean but that's what we're getting back to but that's what Adam was Adam was the ruler of this Earth he controlled every animal he controlled everything thing that happened on the face of the Earth and we lost that in the garden because of what happened and then when God withdrew himself from the earth that's when the fall happened and we're living in it ever since but there was something he was trying and going to achieve in order to let himself be expressed because first it wasn't a Moon Star Adam or anything he was God he was God but he actually look he is actually wasn't God at that time cuz God is not God is an object of worship it wasn't anything to worship him so what did he do he wanted those attributes to be expressed and him was love and him was father and him was to be son savior healer and all those great attributes that we see look brother M brings it today that we see already expressed they were in God so he saw them expressed we see them expressed listen the mind of God when you walk in the this world realize one thing for sure you're the only person that's in that right mind you're the only person that's in the mind of God you're the only person you said oh now what about my brothers I said you better find out if you are it's all right to know that brother Donnie is or brother Lis is but I got to know if I'm in the mind of God if I'm in the will of God Amen so we got to have a deep call cuzz if there's a deep call there's got to be a deep to respond if we're calling out for God he's got more to give us that's why with these virtues we've got to actually ask for them amen we got to ask for them how many of how many of you have asked every time we go to a step God give me virtue that brother's explained to me as much as he can what virtue is now I want some of it no knowled I want knowledge I don't want knowledge that puff it up because remember true Holy Ghost knowledge is a revelation which will drive you down amen amen that's correct there was something in there called out for more of God you might have been living in a Justified state but you wanted the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why I believe in the steps folks if you can't put in your own life justification and when you move from justification you move to sanctification and you knew God was doing something in your life that nobody ever done before you couldn't do it yourself listen you didn't want to do it the real you I mean the one that was in you that that time no that that that I didn't want to do it uhuh I didn't want to go to church oh bro I was born out of the womb going to church now you be born a liar but that's why brother brand always told us justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost because you could be in a Justified condition but you got to know that you got to come to a realization that I've been Justified now Lord get that unclean Spirit out of me that's right change my attitude give me be a new spirit but it's not the Holy Spirit remember we've never been through all this it's a new spirit to get in contact with God and to make him what what brother I'm saying that he can get along with your spirit he said you can't even get along with yourself and that was me can is there times that you can get along with yourself not many well y'all pray for me all y'all just smiling sometimes I can get I can be right with me but most time I can't cuz there's always that little thing sitting here but I know the day I got Justified and the walk that took me through that and then I come to a satified condition and the walk that I came through that amen I say me you going to have listen this has been explained for 50 years that you didn't just come to the message and just drop into a seat and it all come poured down on top of you you had to come through a walk crockpot Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost finally you got something to eat finally you're cooking now the very reason that there is a holy spirit is because you were hungering for it Bible says those that what hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled I know this is simple but we've got to get this down first am before we can have any of this if we think we've got all these and all of a sudden like brother Brown says you you you fall off right here Foundation becomes to crumble and have cracks in it but look what we're talking about this morning Enoch walked with God there was no other nothing else it says about Enoch except he walked with God so he walked with God and and you know what it's kind of strange that Enoch built a pyramid so Enoch builds the pyramid and now the pyramid is being used for all kind of things and even brother brandham comes up and when when when God tells him says go to Second Peter write all them virtues down and then put them in a pyramid amen put them in a pyramid there's Enoch's walk that's Enoch's brick laying ability right there we got to have the same thing cuz what it do with Enoch Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him the same way with me and you we're going to have to walk with God more and more every day are we're not going to make it to the top these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generation and Noah walked with God and Noah and only a few people were saved during that time he preached 120 years boy talking about 120 years he said it was going to rain not one drop not one drop not one scientific note that says well maybe no because remember the ground was what watered from the from the ground that's right brother Brown said not a cloud in the sky got to have clouds to have rain the brother Brown says look now we'll go let's go to Temperance we got to get to patience here real quick Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoken to you you know and and you all know me that I'm pretty quick on the tongue but I'm getting better cuz you know what I'm doing now I'm counting to 10 in my head before I say something sometimes sometimes one two sometimes 11 10 but in answering kindness with wrath is spoken to you how many times that we had to eat our words those of you that are asleep your hands are being raised spiritually cuz we've all been quick on the trigger we've all been and what did it do most of the time pie in the face Mo right most of the time it ain't going to work out if you jump to conclusions so be patient that's why Temperance and patience works together all right but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness if you still blow up and Sass and fuss and stew and carry on you ain't got it it won't vulcanize new talked about vulcanization let's go to patience remember it's not in the Old Testament a man who has not swerve from his deliberate purpose now you see with patience you got to know what you patient for though well I'm just patient patient for what patient that my kid will come to the Lord patient that my husband will come to the Lord see so there's something there's an endgame to that patience I have patience for this God has patience for you cuz he knows you'll either come to this spot or you won't come to this spot he knows the world is going to be redeemed but there's a lot of things got to go through it but he's got it right here that's what he's looking at brother R said Abraham looked at the promise not the circumstances right if he would have rode down in a diary for 25 years he' had never had that baby right he just said God promised it God's going to deliver it a man who has not swerve from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfast steadfast waiting for do you know Simeon Simeon was brother mam said he was way up in his age in his 90s ' 80s or '90s you know who Simeon is Right Simeon was promised by God he wouldn't die until he saw the Lord's Christ folks he waited his entire life for One Promise entire life now he didn't just go over there and sit in the temple and get fat and eat Cheetos right right I believe he went out looking for that every day that's right cuz he knew that Messiah had to come waiting he said for the consolation of Israel and then one day what happened one day brother Brown said he felt something pick him up he felt something draw him that's right as he said in that in the um 20th century prophet said Drew him right to the Fountain hundreds of babies probably getting circumcised that day and here stands a little 16y old girl or 17y old girl with a brand new baby no different than any other baby he didn't look the Catholic Church puts this little halo around the baby there ain't no Halo there now he's God we know that but he didn't walk around with this little light all over him no he was hid he was hid in a crowd but what did God do he went he went he said Simeon I'm fixing to show you the promise that I promised you years and years and years ago brother rown said he felt the pull and said he felt the pull got right up to the baby and said let me have him he said Lord let your servant depart in peace for I have seen the consolation of Israel in other words I I have seen the Messiah I've went through 80 something years of waiting on this promise just for one promise didn't make him no great I don't he wasn't a bishop or or he wasn't the high priest for sure or it would have said he was no he was somebody that worked in the temple he did his job like brother Brown said a little washwoman going to work man with his lunch box under his arm is what God is looking for if they are yielded to him let's skip through here a little bit be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit what the promises for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater I saying this morning he just raised his hand and said hey I'm going to do it Abraham I know you're going to mess up I told you to go by yourself and here you take your cousin or you whatever he was neew here I told you not to do that I told you don't go to Egypt he goes down to I told you not to do he goes God says I'll do it I'm going to swear by myself I'm not swearing by Abraham I'm not swearing by Adam I'm swearing by myself now where is he today he wasn't in Abraham like he's in you right now he was not in anybody in the Old Testament like he's in you right now all the great ones the Moses all the different ones they didn't have the Holy Ghost by by the new birth they had a holy ghost anointing that way they could do what they did they killed somebody or or commit adultery and God just seemingly Let It Go but he didn't let it go like that but David if he had had the Holy Ghost he' never had his best friend killed he never committed adultery against his best friend amen but he had an anointing you and I have the person dwelling inside of us in good times and bad times hey we're married to just like that marriage vow says good or bad rich or poor sickness and health brother Brown said one time and I'm going to try to find that he said you ought to love God more when you're sick than you are when you're well cuz you know something's coming you know he's the Healer how could you be how can you know he was a Healer if you never got sick I've been so sick and I know y'all have to that you you didn't even couldn't pray but you know what what you do you just lay there and wait or you just stand there and wait or you just sit there and wait you just keep going just keep going keep going my breth count it all joy I want y'all to call call me every time y'all get in a a problem I do I want you to call me you got my phone number but I want you to be laughing right I want you to be praising God nothing negative now when you fall into many Temptations count it all joy knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire look wanting nothing that's your perfect man you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ in other words we getting up here into into patience but so many of us trying to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us now there's the trouble we can find these things happening you know you know it you know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heaps of Ministers of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right and that's why I'm here this morning look brother brandham knew what he was here for he might have not have said I'm a prophet he knew he was a prophet deep down inside but he was here to teach this little church he was here to teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many would like to be that second Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us to us word not willing that any should perish but all should come to repentance James 5:7 says be patient therefore Brethren until the coming of the Lord behold the husband waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth who's the precious fruit of the earth you and I are amen and hath long patience for it how about an eternal person waiting on us think about that an eternal person waiting an eternal person having patience but you know why it's because of us until he received the former or early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh let's continue on statute of perfect man fourthly we want to add patience to your faith if you got faith it worketh patience the Bible said so this is patience that's the next thing going to build this stature God has to get real material in his building see how short we are brother and sisters see why we're at yes sir see we have Glory we have shouts and things but because we got faith and like I said before it's good to have special meetings and everybody get motivated and activated and we do shout some and we do you know enjoy the glory of the Lord but it's like brother Donnie Reagan said he said that's a special meeting that's why that word special is in there CU it's not every day you have a special meeting Wednesdays and Sundays Wednesdays and Sundays you're laboring the ox is laboring right and you're laboring not so much you you you shout and speak in tongues or shout or or even say Amen most time because but you got faith but look you got faith but we have Glory we have shouts because we got faith but when we come down to these things here yes these things right here God can't build us into that stature see he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things we fall slide off with it he can't build his church praise God he does build his church though but look faith alone won't do it this is kind of where we was at this morning elshad brother Brown said that Abraham we find out he didn't obey God just right now he made ready and had faith in the promise but see we can still have faith in the promise and not obey still it'll hinder us huh we can have faith we all have faith in the word of God if you're born again you got faith all right you have faith in the promise but sometimes we don't obey it I I'm I'm reading what's in red look still it hinders us now you say I believe in the Holy Spirit I believe I should be baptized with the Holy Spirit now no matter how much you believe you got to obey that commission obey that commission just faith alone won't work because because faith without works is dead that's right now when we think of works stop just a minute right here when we think of Works what do you think oh we got to make sure that we we're on the serving line and we make sure that we take the trash out and we make sure that the pews get clean and we make sure that ain't works that ain't works works is that right there that's having virtue for someone that's having knowledge to be able to help somebody to be able to sit around a table and some of us get together and and you know say what about this I've always had a question about this and you answer the question or or the question gets answered by somebody it doesn't really matter how the question gets answered I just want the correct answer to the question and the person that ask it I want them to be satisfied with it all right because faith without works is dead so there's got to be Works behind that faith see you can't tell me some like I said this morning you can't tell me that somebody can sit in the message Pew for 30 years and then deny the whole message and say it's wrong that brother R's wrong he's just a false prophet how can you do that well that you can but you fall away there's no way to get back unless you repent and go back just like the borderline Believers got people today you find in the Bible that says for it is impossible for those which are once enlightened here we go and made partakers of the Holy Ghost and fall away to renew themselves again into to repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and count the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing in other words what do you say it God's blood is not strong enough to do away with my problems that's what you're saying right that's what this person's saying seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aesh and count the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing and done despite to the works of Grace Hebrews 10 it says it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living God and those people you've seen them come to church they'll come and they'll say oh I believe yes sir but they'll they believe it but they'll never lay their hands to it to turn one will to help it go on that's not serving in a child line that's not cooking the best squ cro SLO that's good wonderful very credible extremely important to some of us but to God that's not works that's just being a good fellow human being a good Christian person look because he says look look never lay their hands to it to turn one wheel to help it go on God I don't want to ever hinder somebody that's why I say in the service you walk through that door you come up for prayer whatever it is if you're sitting back there you need to say God clean my slate clean my slate make sure I'm not the one that's going to have to stand and say you're the one that caus this person to not get healing I don't want that but it's so simple to say God forgive me when we take communion listen when you take communion if you start and I know what the devil will do he's going to give you 7,000 reasons to not take it you did this I think sister I think sister Anna did she looked at me wrong the other day and and I don't think I don't think she needs to take it it's her fault you worry about your fault right but when I take communion I do the same thing though I said Lord if I made it cuz brother R will tell you in the communion message he said now if you've committed a wrong to somebody he said if you can't get to him right then he said go ahead and take communion he said but you better go get that took care of as soon as you're finished all right don't let it Linger on like Brother D said Don't Let It Go two weeks and say well it was their fault to begin with no you going to have to deal with God right that's why I like to have communion every month clean your slate off don't let that thing pile up listen don't let stuff pile up get it out of the way and be able to take communion cuz what is communion communion with God you're not communing with your brother and sister here you're communing with God you're saying God I believe that's the last commission you gave your disciples before you passed this life into another life and you're not coming back here in your Corporal body until we leave this place and this is the closest we're going to get now it's not turn that does not do like Catholic it does not turn into the Flesh of God or Jesus and the Flesh and the blood but it's a symbol he said do this till I come do this till I come so it's a symbol that that we're not communing with each other we're communing with God that one time uh it's like you know we always and I know Sister Rebecca's uh being an accountant and different things there's time when you check up things you know you let things go and she wishes you wouldn't so she wouldn't have to long do your taxes talking to the Dales the way Dale Jun but if it you know you have a checkup time where everything's got to come up in Balance all right well that's what you got to do to me with communion I look at it that way for me it doesn't let it linger three months down the road when I come in on communion I take it serious you better take it serious cuz it it'll tell you that many have fell asleep died because of taking communion wrong you say well I don't never take it now I see you go on the other side you let the devil do that but now clean your slate say God today of any other day before I touch that cup before I touch that bread sanctify me Lord you said you would amen clear my slate check me up get me to balance at zero now I might have a big balance coming the next month but God right now balance me at zero get me to where I zero me out and I trust in what you said you said do this till I come you know there people in the message in the message is quit taking communion CU they think we're in the Millennium I still want to take them to a zoo throw them in with the Lions cuz a lion's supposed to lay down with a lamb in the Millennium you understand what I'm saying yeah we're supposed to have rulership over the animals let's toss them over in the lines Den we'll find out if they in the Millennium or not that's right they believe it but they'll never lay their hands on to turn Wheels to help it go on I've told y'all many times before just like taking communion if you don't take communion it shows that you do have a problem okay and then i' for many years a lot of people took communion and when foot washing time come out the door they went well Jesus told Peter if you don't do it you have no part with me I think to me that settles it and I don't wait on my favorite person to wash your feet either well I'm going down that road anyway but really why wouldn't you want to wash your brother's feet you know what Pride you're too proud if Jesus Christ himself washed them dirty feet of those disciples you and I ought to do the same thing and be happy are ye if you do them is what the Bible says happy are you but he turned to Peter he said Peter if you don't if I don't you don't let me wash your feet said you'll have no part with me you say oh that was for Peter well no that was for me it gets rid of my pride when I get down and wash somebody like brother Tom Ernest always man he he looked you right in the face he said it's an honor to wash your feet brother and he'll get down and big old you Tom big tall guy brother dick Addison brother Al they couldn't hardly walk right you'd have to help him up you know what I don't care if we have to put a pulley on this ceiling and pull them up by pulley if they want to get down wash somebody's feet praise the Lord we'll help them up you know what God will reward their effort I'm sorry didn't mean to get off on that but I guess I did but they hung along just the same they never got to enter the promised land he's talking about the people that were unbelievers just those who came back with faith that we could now what if that group would have looked and said oh the amorites in other words my sin's too strong I've done too much but you see Caleb and Joshua still the people cuz they wasn't looking for at the amorites how big they were if we keep looking at how big this sin is or how big this world is and how we're going to get so caught up in the government and we're going to take the mark of the beast and we're going listen if you're born again you're not Lord if you are going to take the mark of the beast you're not born again right and brother R said you won't know it till it's already done how big the city was they were looking at a promise God said I give you this land it's yours now God give you your healing each one of you it's yours well now God just didn't go over there and took a broom and sweep out Canaan and all the amorites and the Hittites and all of them and swept them out and said come on in Israel this is yours they've even planted crops for you no sir they had to fight for every inch of the way now this was their promised land they had to fight for yeah that's right but they had the promise of Victory God told Joshua wherever The Souls of your feet tread that I've given you so Footprints means possession we were talking about that this morning Footprints means possession that's why to me foot washing is important because your feet mean something how blessed and how beautiful are the feet of them that carry the gospel beautiful because Footprints is possession everywhere you walk you're possessing the gates of the enemy brother R said look patience with what what kind of patience first thing is what have patience with who God if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience you say well brother wait how does that work well if you got patience if you've got faith Abraham was the father of our faith he had faith faith and that made him patient I didn't say impatient having faith that my kids are going to come to the Lord and be full of the Holy Ghost before the Rapture takes place if I have real true faith it won't put me in a hurry it'll settle me put me in patient mode and just wait on God that's right can't save them to begin with I'd been saved 30 something years ago if Mama had been my savior but she's not but she she she cried out to God Dad cried out to God different ones each one of you somebody somebody you may never met him in your life you said boy my my parents were Sinners and my grandparents were Sinners and somebody brother Brown son said some Old Saint got on her knees and said God Save My Generation save my people save them it doesn't matter in spite of this one not making it save somebody if You' got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith work as patience When God says anything look you believe it and look by faith you take it see that's right you've got patience well I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just as sick what patience now Noah he had patience if it didn't come today it'll be here tomorrow why God said so God said so let me tell you something we have come to a spot in the in the word of God where look we know who God is he's not third person of a trinity he's not three people he's one God so we know that God we've come to another place to where we know what this said by the prophet's message right so we know in that little three words God said so because you know what somebody in the world can say well God said so well he's the third person in the Trinity said to baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost sure he did but not the way you wanted so when we make that statement when brother rown makes that statement to me it just thundered out all over the world God said so because you know who that God is you know what he said is the truth and so be it to me folks that's patience if it' been up to us we' the Rapture would have took place a long time ago but he's Let It Go he's Let It Go he's Let It Go he's Let It Go to where now we see others coming back in we see others um going out but he knew that now we find God comes this far look waiting for the church too but it'll be there don't you worry he promised it Isaiah 40:28 musicians come on I'll stop right here hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fth not neither is he weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength how many of you want to get in that so do I even the youth shall Fain and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk see some's going to run some's going to walk and not fade as the song says teach me Lord teach me Lord to wait where does it tell you to wait at though down on your knees let's stand to our feet I'll read this and then we'll close the trouble of it is with we people now listen this was 1962 think of all the advancements that we have now that they didn't have back then we got phones that we can go in and and order everything from a car almost to a house on our phone and brother BR says look we're in too much of a hurry it's just got to be done right now can't come back no more see and when you get that in your mind that you're going to Lo when you get that in your mind you're going to lose right there you're own Lo losing ground right there you have nothing to stand on you must be patient they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and mount up with wings like an eagle I like that just be patient wait look God's in no hurry he let the Hebrew children walk right into the furnace before he ever moved a finger we'd be nerv I'm sure they were nervous in their s but you know what they stood there and said they said our God we're going to worship him we're not going to worship yours you're not going to make us not worship Our God and if he in other words if he don't come on the scene we're going to die and meet him in just a few seconds but oh my did he not come on the scene and listen not even did they get burned they didn't even smell like smoke when they come out God so Sanctified them man he put them in a fiery furnace and brought them out just like they on a Alaska Voyage that's right and let Daniel go right in the line listen lowered him right down Daniel probably wasn't shouting speaking in tongues he probably was worried a little bit about those lines but when he saw that line walk by him and just walk by him and then sit down beside of him and start puring like a kitten he knew right there that something was going on God was on the scene Jesus look watch this Jes Jesus went Plum into the grave his soul went to hell then raised him up through the bottomless pit right out through the grave cut every Avenue of the devil off and went straight into Glory with it see he's in no hurry he's God we just get in a hurry is the only thing you see we miss it so don't be in a hurry wait and watch listen take the scripture examine it see if it's right and if it's right hold on to it if it's not tell me so I can get it right that should be our prayer then remember what happened with Noah remember Noah Noah here here's the great Crescendo of his sermon he comes up today 120 of of his 120 year sermon and God says get in the ark God said get in the ark all right so whatever voice Noah had been listening to he listened to that one too he knew it was God God said get in the ark so Noah's like it's going to rain soon as them doors shut it's going to

there's nothing else any better than this that's not an invention man has never come to this part to be able to be a group of people that can talk to a god that's real that's Eternal that's right here waiting to give you everything you need the I'm walking in New of life I cannot fall forer than all the blood of the you know they had to have faith that night of the Passover they had to believe something had never been written they had to believe a man it wasn't wrote down brother John it wasn't in the sky it wasn't published and and hand it out to everybody God told Moses tell your people take a lamb kill that lamb take the blood and put it over the doorpost and don't get out stay in there eat that lamb don't don't don't fry it don't put no herbs on it this is not a party right this is getting ready to go it's a solemn time and look don't get delator and sit down and take your shoes off and put your house shoes on he said because we're leaving you're leaving this place as soon as a death angel passes you're going out of here yes but if you're not under that blood you'll die also you know people that they were this far from death and that far from life right inside the door they were safe if they just stepped right outside the door they died they believed that that blood was going to protect them they believed and that's why brother B preaches the token talk about the token in the end time we understand while that blood had to be shed we understand why Jesus had to shed his blood we understand how all those symbols and everything but that Blood Brother Bown then he comes he sums everything up in a sermon he says the bride is now the blood by the spirit the bride is now the blood by the spirit so whatever went over that doorpost was the bride whatever hung at Calvary say what you wish that's the bride but now we understand that by the spirit of God we're that blood you that's pretty strong brother that's pretty well well you talked to brother Brown about it he said now see he come to a place now the bride is the blood by the spirit that means the same spirit that was in that blood The Same Spirit is inside of me and you and he's ready to not just give us a little Redemption he didn't put it over your doorpost he put it inside of you so now you're protected the blood's been applied you're walking in newness of life we can't fail we may look bad we may look bad hey we got Monday coming up okay but God willing we'll be here Wednesday to hear here brother Louise and we'll have made it through another Monday amen count those we count all these other days count every Monday as a blessing to get through but but same thing with us in our walk with God we all have Mondays in our walk we all have Sundays in our walk that's right and our weak but let's not be weak in faith let's believe that sure we got a trial to go through but on the other side is a blessing those children of Israel would have died if they would have went outside of that blood but everyone that stayed inside I like that talking about the movie The of Ten Commandments you see that death angel coming down that black and you see it hitting the ground and start spreading out well you know what it don't didn't go under no crack in the in the the one that had the Blood Cuz you know what happened that Death Angel he goes down and he looks and he sees blood he keeps going he finds one it's not he goes right in cuz that was his commission God told him said take the firstborn and if they're not apply if they don't apply the blood get them out of you know take them out and they did all of Israel the Bible said all of Egypt was screaming even the firstborn of the cattle everything that was first born died that night except the ones that were covered with the blood they did what a preacher told them to do that's right I cannot fall for greater than all the blood of the Lamb singing as your dismiss be here Wednesday night than all my S is the blood that still cleanses me
