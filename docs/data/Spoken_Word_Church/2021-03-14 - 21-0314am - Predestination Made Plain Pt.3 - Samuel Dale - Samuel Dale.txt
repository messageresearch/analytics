is getting longer and all and as we're getting all of us getting older it's coming up about the day and time that we're living but we pray that you would just guide each one of us reach down and touch the sick and deliver each one we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen matthew 22 this is the uh marriage supper you know that invites and thing but we're just mainly wanting the last part of the service part part of the scripture but we'll start on verse 10. so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there a man which had not owned a wedding garment and he saith unto him friend how came was thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the king to the servant bind him hand and foot and take him away cast him into the outer darkness then there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for as many as our as far as many are called for many excuse me are called but few are chosen now that's the main part of what we're doing to get to that after a while in the in the message okay let's go to second peter 1 verse 10. wherefore to rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never follow for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ now the point see i'm getting back over here you've got the wedding services you've got the wedding the coming in the bride the bridegroom and the thing and the things of happening of all life and then here you're coming down to seeing how that you get an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly unto the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yeah i thank you meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance okay you may be seated lord that is blessing to the word i kind of look back there and every time i look back i get kind of wondering if i'm leaning because there's there's a whole lot more over here on this side now we're over here on this side and it looks like the building is moving over so you know just stay where you at okay all right amen now i've tried to uh bring some things on predestination and all like that and we've studied it and talked about it and we the life's message we tried to cover some things about how does god predestinate all right we know predestination is a destiny determined before you know your your destiny is that it's it's determined if there's a destiny and then you know we're looking at the end of all things and i believe we're down here to where we can comprehend in this day that we have the destiny is here and what is our destiny what is our what is our uh point what are we supposed to be looking at in this age because there is a destiny their every age had a word or seed you know to give to that age and every age has fulfilled that and brought it forth in manifestation all right see then it comes to the basis of knowing that god and how he predestinates and how does he predestinate by what by foreknowledge not the fact that anybody he would desire anybody to be lost he wants everybody to be saved but he knows they won't be and we know that we have that understanding within ourselves to comprehend the point you know that that as many people as are in the world they're just not going to to to be saved but what you know everybody because it's not for everybody it's for a chosen people but how did he choose that now that's our point that we've been driving at for for time and you know and all is how can we how can god predetermine or set a destiny for someone you know without it being crossing up in and it looks like he picked one you know choosing one and losing the other all right now if we look at that basis then we're we're making everything on a a basis of choosing without having a situation and then when it comes to jacob and esau jacob have i loved and he saw how i hated well now we know that the words are for the hate word is not the right term to use there but it's it's not saying that god hates he saw he just don't like his ways i think see you you say well he hated no no he he didn't hate because god can't hate there's nothing within him to be able to hate his his whole makeup his whole thing is love his whole nature his ways is doing his love and and it cannot be determined to where it would be you know well god hates this person and loves that one no it's based on whether or not he saw buy for knowledge that's the main thing right for knowledge for knowledge is back there destiny is going to where you're going to predestinated unto the which means a position that you must come to that we'll get to that this afternoon more the lord willing but to think about it that how does god do that without choosing or picking but yet we know he does choose and pick right because he chose us all right we'll read it in the scriptures to get on around in a minute he we never chose him right he chose us he cannot override your free moral agency that can't work he must give you the right to choose but he knows your choice now if he's god then truly he would know before the foundation of the world so then he could go ahead and write all the names in the book or leave the names out of the book of life because he's god and he's infinite he's finite in all of his doings he he is uh you know to the basis of of you can't pull anything over on him so don't try that you know try to figure out well where this that or the other just accept it like it is that's what i've tried to get you to see just to simply talk about predestination in the terms and points of seeing that you know that god before the world ever begun in his mind he could see everything that would ever take place all right so then he would see that some people would want to be saved and he could see that some people would not accept their salvation all right so then it would be left on some reason or surpr some point or are the thoughts you know well well how does he do that because if he just picks out i'll take this one and reject that one then that's respect of persons and that's overriding your free moral agency so he's got to allow you to to do and it's got to be that uh like we talk about the the the book of life written before the foundational world when jesus christ stood as a lion slain before the world ever begun but see that had to come to a place to take place that was in god's mind all right well see one day it became a reality somewhere around 2000 years ago see that he died on calvary all right then we can see that he made the place he set the time the destiny that before the world not that he set a point but he knew what would take place that's what i've tried to get you to think on predestination think about it as god knowing all things all right see then jesus christ stood as a lamb slain before but yet that happened two thousand years ago in reality all right see you and i that's what i'm trying to get you to look at now we're in reality we're sitting here right now in reality right in reality now sitting here right now this is our destiny all right this is our point this is where we're living okay now we're going to have to go further on because there's a destiny set for things and all and there's something that see you you say well i'm a born-again christian well that's great we'll get to that this afternoon on your predestinated in adoption that that's not your birth it's not your adoption your adoption is your placing or setting and looking at somebody finding today where we're at our destiny and see then you'll see what it means when you come up to predestination and the point of where it goes to on adoption but to get to the point now that's what we're talking about predestination is a destiny determined all right we covered the said in about three minutes two messages so far trying to get the point of seeing how does god predestinate it's not how we think about it it's not what we think it is me because we'll get it all messed up but it's whether or not he what he knows all right and see if you say he doesn't know then what kind of a god are you serving me so give him the right study it like that and think about it that he would could foreknow before the world ever begun and see that and see that you would choose you would choose him as your savior that you would choose him as your god like the old testament form see and we studied that about abraham and him and what did god why did god go to abraham what was his reason what did he why did he choose as we look at it why did he choose abraham because you're not talking about the new birth so you get over into the new birth you get into a deeper meaning or thoughts about what you're talking about and you can see more that he that we were chosen in him all right not just the proponent of saying we were chosen of him and that's true that's good but we were chosen in him but go back there as i did with you and try to talk about abraham what made god ex go to abraham there must be something some reason some point that you look at to where that you can see god does not pick and choose you know i'll take one won't take the other but he knows he knows your destiny you don't know it but he knows your destiny he knows you're going to all right we may not know that much we have to live day by day that's why i keep emphasizing if we'll ever get to realize right where we're sitting now we're sitting in our predestination we're sitting in our destiny our destiny is being formed all right everything's coming in order all right then as it does then we can look at it and see where we're at right now see when we get to it this afternoon you'll see more about it that the scripture says you know that we were chosen of him he said i chose you you didn't choose me well then all right it looks like you ain't got nothing to do with anything all right now that's what i tell you that you've got to understand about the bible and the way it is and the way the word of god turns out to be because on one set of scales or one way of looking at it he chose you you didn't have anything to do with the choosing but on the other side of the same scale you're looking at it and the fact that you chose him you accepted him all right see it has to be done that way to bring both of them into view and when you do you bring it together in a situation of saying well now he chose me so it don't matter what i do or what it is because he chose me all right now see that won't work all right but the fact was true that he did choose you but then the fact is true that you must accept him he cannot override your free moral agency and make you is choose him right no he knew though before knowledge going all the way back in the mind of god all the way before the foundation world he knew before the world ever begun before anything ever started or he had in his mind what he was going to do he was going to have a group of people he was going to bring into being a people upon the earth he knew that in his foreknowledge all right but not only that he knows what those people will do see that way he's not making you choose him he's looking at the fact of what you did you accepted him if you don't bring it on the point of a free moral agency to put it to worthy he can't override that and make you saved but he can look at what will take place and know what your salvation is and have everything ready now when you get down to where we're at now from where we are sitting today and i'm going to say it that way where you'll uh i'll try to keep everything trying to make it certain lining up to where we are now all right not yesterday and not tomorrow but we'll get to it this afternoon and the prophet says you're predestinated unto adoption all right somebody has to come to that place see then somebody has to reach that pla and it is based upon what you accept right statute of perfect man is not based upon god just pouring it into you it's based on what you can accept all right we've got to get that right see because where we are now going on nobody i don't mean to get into the season but i'll repeat it don't bother see nobody in no age has been predestinated unto adoption but this age here you're predestinated to a destiny every age has a seed a word a predestination and a destiny to come to that place martin luther is wade was bringing out the other day and these brothers have been talking about martin luther of the just shall live by faith that was the predestinated word for that age all right see then once he reached that age he had reached his position and he had to go by the grave he couldn't stay here see then john wesley comes along with sanctification all right that was another word predestinated that had to take place and in doing that see then his destiny that god before the world saw john wesley come to that place and he had the word for him all right she come in through your zeus street and thing and that's good but remember that's not the finish of the story the finish of the story is in me and you and we've got to remember one thing he could see the beginning and the end in the beginning before the world ever begun anything any anything other than being in his mind right let's don't try to get anything out of that let's get it into that when we finish up the message maybe this afternoon we'll talk about gifts and callings there's gifts and callings that are without without anything you do that god does give them to us but we've got to get the rest of it right up to there we've got to understand that no matter what takes place what here there had to be a foreknowledge of knowing that god would send a prophet in this day of malachi 4. and that would be a predetermined seed to take place in the day that you and i are living well just think of it on one thing why can't you think of it this way if he predestinated a prophet for the age a seed a word for the age he would have to predestinate a people to accept that word we're going to go beyond four knowledge when we eventually get there you see you can't go do that why not he's the infinite god he knows all things so he knows everything this is well one way as he knows the other way all right but are you thinking with me what how does he predestinate we know he does not predestinate we've been through these you and they can bring this up if they want to on the the quotes i'm beginning lately to just give you the tape it's out of and and going to trying to get you to understand to help us to realize that go to number one which is the harvest time where pre god has predestinates by his foreknowledge all right and then he can set the destiny by that foreknowledge and not by your desires he desired that everybody be saved and we have to look at the thing and seeing that we didn't desire him we didn't understand now but we didn't desire him he chose us right all right then when he chose us see then i've got to ex to accept what he done knowing that he has a destiny set for me we're living our destiny you understand we're living every day our destiny yeah right right we're beyond pentecost jesus streets and things by the opening of god's word all right and in being that then our destiny is set right but we've got to come to that destiny we've got to come to that place don't you think that god before the world knew what we would do don't you think he knows what your desire is now how did we covered about abraham what caused god to look to abraham when there were a lot of people in the world in that day and he chose one man abraham right right now why did he choose him because by his foreknowledge abraham chose him or accepted him he knew abraham would accept what he's doing that was what i was trying to drive that last week to get you to see it he knew what abraham would do and that's what drawed him to abraham he knew his brother brown said he said he knew abraham would teach his children he knows whether or not you'll teach your children and try to bring them to the truth amen all right see then his predestination is not to look down through time and say i need somebody so oh i'll just take this guy now there was something about abraham and i tried my best to explain it to you abraham the bible said believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness so whatever you make abraham to be or have or whatever make it the point that god knew see then that way you won't be running over into our day in our times and getting the message and bring the quotes and try to prove our point oh that we we were back there before the foundational world well in god's mind yeah but in god's mind everybody was back there in god's mind he wrote the book of life right right but he also wrote if daniel has it there's books see that's what i'm trying to get you to see and get you to look at god for new everybody amen he knows what everybody will do he's not just speaking and choosing you've got to get to where you're at to be able to understand that this is the only age that will bring it to the picking and choosing so you and i have a choice we can take the word we can receive it we can go up the statue of a perfect man or we can just laze around and say forget it but you know nobody's ever had that except you and i now get that point nobody's ever had the opportunity that you have that's what i've been driving at that's what i've been trying to preach to you you have an opportunity that nobody has ever had right amen because you can go back to seeing how that you could be a part of god and how that the prophet would say god is not complete without you now i didn't make those statements your prophet did all right but you see there was something about abraham that caused god to move into that position he said well he he foreknew right he foreknew that that abraham would receive him that's what i'm trying to drive to to get you to see by his foreknowledge he knew abraham would do what he would do but he knew the rest of the people would do what they would do so he's not picking and choosing right he's going by the fact of what he knows he knows abraham would do the way he done that's right but he knows he could deal with you know with anybody else in that day he could deal with them for a hundred years and they'd never move one stitch you just think about abraham get what i'm talking about get your predestination get out all of your your great ideas of oh if i was back before the world then i'll be all i'll be back before well everybody was back before the world in god's mind that's right every person that would ever be in the world every gnat that would ever come into the world was in the mind of god before the world so that's why i've always tried to teach you i don't want to be what god thinks of in his mind i want to be a part of the one that's doing the thinking amen amen i want to be a part of him amen see then that way then i'll find out that i'm not picking i mean he wasn't picking and choosing but yet he was that's what i'm telling you i can cover the scale and go one way and preach to you about how that god chose you and you didn't choose him you didn't have nothing to do with it you know you know you can bring it all down because that's the way people go but turn right around and go over on the other side of the scale and preach the point that god was looking at you and you made a choice he said well i just don't understand it because one way you're saying i made a choice another way you're saying i didn't make a choice that's what i'm talking about that's what i want us to see there was a whole world full of people god could come down and talk to a lot of them but why did he choose abraham see there was something about the nature of the man what does he wind up to be i think it's four times said our father abraham why does it wind up to be that abraham is the father of faith ever what he was looking at in abraham wound up one day to walk on this earth in the human flesh and wound up dying to give his life where you could have an eternal life you can't just put it on one way and look at it and say well i i just don't understand i just i just accept the fact that he he he died for me well that's good but we're in a day when it's meaning more to us than ever that there's something about this end time that god has been waiting on the people he's waiting on you and i he's waiting for you and i to come to our choice to worthy he can look at it and say that was what i saw before the world ever begun was you making that choice and i've been just waiting in other words that's the way god would say it was human terminology i was just waiting for you to come to the place to where you could accept it see there's something about you that's different well a new birth that's all right but remember abraham was a man without the new birth he never had the new birth to make a choice from you have something that motivates your choice today you come a long ways to be able to get here today something motivated that choice huh see you didn't have to you could stay home flat tape you know you could just stay at home flat tight get the tape just play it but listen church he's not looking for the people that just want to well i would listen to the tapes i do this out now i'm just i'm in the message i'm listening to the prophet i get it straight from the prophet i don't listen to nobody else well you think god didn't see that would you think god didn't see you struggling to get here today i remember brother zemer was talking about this brother told him about it and you know and he was going to jeffersonville and and brought around and told him said you struggled all the way here he they asked him sit or talk to him said well what about it what huh he said i just got in the car and drove there but to brother branham it was a great struggle there's no telling what went in between all of that he may have had a flat tire he may have had a disney he may have had that he may have had a wreck he may have had all kinds of things and god looks at it like that he's looking at your desire he predestinates according to your desire not according to his own desire because he desired that everybody be saved but he looks at your desire he looked at abraham and he saw a man that he contacted him and then he knew that he'd contact him many many times in his journey and it would keep unfolding but he knew what abraham would do so abraham's called the father of faith i've always tried to get you to see that there's a man without the new birth without the new birth that man still there was something about him that god looked down and saw him it's like i said we'll get the gifts and callings without repentance what about moses what about all the gifts that was in the man what about brother branham what about all the gifts it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it's the word of seed you've got to accept the word for your age and your time but you've got to find it the prophet preached the message there recognized in your day in its message we believe brother branham was a prophet we've been well praise god but there's a lot more goes with it see a predestinated group of people that their destiny before the world ever begun was already set wait a minute we see it was set because he looked back there and saw it or in other words he sat there and saw it i asked you a question about predestination was god before the world looking at the whole world ahead of him and seeing it or is he looking at it now is this what he was looking at why can't you move it up to where we are come on do you understand what i'm getting at you understand what i'm saying what predestination him sitting back there looking to the forward or his predestination him living it with us your prophet could talk about the lamb that stood before the foundation of the world and all like that but then turn right back around and say but you know that took place 2000 years ago you realize what would have happened had that not taken place 2000 years ago it would have made the word a false prophecy you realize your prophet said there's going to be a bride to come to a change of the body and if somebody don't reach there then it would wind up being false prophecy but don't you worry about it it's already predetermined all we got to do is just walk that's what i'm trying to get you to see it ain't hard you say how are we going to get out of here brother dale how are we going to come to a change of the body how are we going to when we fulfill the word that is predestinated in the age that we're living that's right amen when we live the life see then god did choose you for some reason but he didn't choose everybody for some reason so i keep going back to it he looked at abraham and he saw in that man what he was looking for someone that he could come down and contact and get him to line up and go with him and walk when there was the whole world it could have picked any of them like i've always tried to get you to to think about their little virgin mary how many little virgins in that day was going around saying you know i could be that girl i could be that one the bible speaks because they could read it you remember brother branham while he was doing he said joseph and mary was sitting down and said they were talking about the message and the hour and all and he said that was what was on her mind if she was going to the well that morning to get some water and god just stepped out in the form of an angel but you see she said what the key was why did god choose her the key was what's she saying that's right when he told her that angel told her what was said and she said uh first off she's right uh how can i do it not knowing a man right that was human that was all he said god's gonna take care of that then she just turned around and said be it unto me according to what you've told me that was what contacted god are you following me if you're looking for anything to contact god with go back to his word see i've tried to tell you about it you know and i'm not trying to make anything of me in their thoughts or anything but that was the thing that caught me i told my wife i said i was reading the bible one day and i told her i said before the end of the world comes there's gonna be two prophets well see i couldn't get it straight i didn't know how to straighten it up so i had malachite three malachi 4. and i said i could see that well why would i see it when the theologians couldn't see it they didn't see it they didn't accept it when it came right see by the proof of what it was as to whether or not it was right or not and what i was doing i accepted it quick as i heard it and never had any trouble except in the message right why all right and look at it easily by it being that away god had something he could come down and contact me with that's right when brother mark begin to talk about a prophet coming in and down then like i told you about that man one day at work was talking about the jehovah witness and their doctrine he said if you just believed in prophets me and you could talk i said i got a little bit of understanding of the bible i said let's go let's let's get started talking i i think i can i think i can kind of hang with you a little bit about prophets you know because there i was trying to talk to him about who the prophet was you know all right what are you with me see i'm trying my best to get you to see this point some reason or some point sure god looked down and he saw every move every man would ever make everything he saw that he would give everybody a change and he wouldn't pick or choose sure he would choose in the bases that when we accepted him because you've got to accept him as your savior you say he accepted me that's the important thing no no he's working on the basis that you accepted him and then when you come to the point of seeing that you accepted him as your savior then he can bring salvation on the view into view to break it make it personal he saw before the world ever begun that the man would die on a cross right but you know what one day that man had to die on the cross or it would have just been no good think about where you come from and how you heard about the message in the thing just think about that sometimes and how that you con you you was contacted as we call it or you you you know you come into the message you you received it you walked in it i can say i can tell a few of your thing or boyd raised his hand well you know what he had to do he had to quit this job had to go through this job and go through that job and come to gainesville well then he had to meet janet and then he had this i'd had help what about it just think about it this thing ain't haphazard and it's simple once you see it get it all straight of how that god could set back before the world and see everything that would ever take place but the way i think see i'm sorry that's just the way i think i think he can go over here and look back that away i think god can go to the end and look back and see the beginning he's infinite see so then i'm asking you is this the predestination you're living your predestination you've accepted jesus christ as your savior right all right according to the prophet now he said that's predestination he said but now predestination is not your new birth adoption and things not your new birth stature of perfect man is what you got to be dealing with now so we're a group of people that's got something personal right out of the word of god that has got to be fulfilled in our age we have got to come to the place of the statute of a perfect man and why can't we say us why can't we believe it's us see think about it how that god crossed your path that's what i was trying to do with you the other day in the messenger how that god contacted abraham how that god contacted moses how that god contacted david see there was something about david that the bible says he's a man after my own heart now he was a murderer he was all kind of thing but you know what he had a nature about him that god life you know what his nature was he loved god that's simple he loved god see he didn't know about all the things but he just knew but then one day he came in contact with the prophet i like what uh uh saul said you know he's trying to talk to her one time it's in the movies this man's ways but it was a good point he said telling them boys and i said just be aware of an old man with a bottle you know what i'm talking about he contacted saul he anointed him he'd become king he had a lot of trouble all through his life he said just beware of an old man with a bottle i thought somebody picked that up in that movie and put it in there is a good point but listen do you see how that he could predetermine something by the fact of what that person would choose okay ephesians says 1-3 he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world now let's try to bring this thing up a level because looking at it from the old testament standpoint see you're not looking at it to where this fulfills what it wants to be this is a new testament scripture this is speaking of jesus christ it was fine back there christ was spoke of through the bible he's read he done and all but yet when we come to the new testament part to think about what happened what happened the day you accepted him as your savior you realize the bible says that no man can come to god unless the father calls him okay then that's why i read the scriptures i make your calling and election sure make your calling an election be scriptural or understanding [Music] make it be what the bible's talking about not some well if i was if i predestinated i'll be there god knew he knew i won't be saved you realize what we're doing today proves whether we are chosen of god what you're doing right now the thoughts you're having right now and things about what i'm talking about is proving whether or not you are called of god well brother dale just don't understand see then you're not called of god see i hate to say those statements but i want to say them to where that you'll think where you'll think about it where you'll sit down and ponder it sometimes in your mind and praying and asking god reveal this to me the word i can see what's going on it sounds like to hear that he has chosen me but it sounds like over here that i had to choose him see then we we finalized it by saying you can't do both of them well you can in god because he chose us but he knew what we would do he didn't give you eternal life before the world that's the problem with the people see i always was eternal that's in god's mind because it took 6 000 years to get from god's mind of jesus christ dying on the cross to get it into a stage of reality right come on are you with me it took 6 000 years or well 4 000 to bring it up to be technical to bring it to where that he could die on a tree like i've always said to you he couldn't die at two years of age two years of age he couldn't be your savior he couldn't be your healer he had to wait till the time he couldn't be your advocate until he become of age to where he could fulfill that and his ministry only lasted a three and a half year period but yet it finished by calvary see in calvary is where he where we were chosen at was we chosen before the world or was we chosen when he died on a tree in god's mind he saw us and saw what we do but in reality you couldn't accept salvation until jesus christ died are you with me you had to wait you had to be so then it's not just a haphazard thing that well we we do this or that see i keep referring to abraham and then try to bring it over now to where we're taking it into the new birth for this afternoon but there was something about abraham and god knew now listen i'm going to say it and i mean it this way because i'm going to say it that way abraham was the only man in the world that god could come down and contact him and that he would follow him now you tell me i'm wrong there and i'll tell you you sure don't understand the word of god there was a world full of people billions even if you want to cut it down with brother dale it wouldn't be and see you want to get technical with me i'll get technical if you had a million if you had ten thousand i still am all i still a large point of what i'm talking about did he pick one man he chose one man but you see what was he going by in his mind in reality he met abraham that's what i'm talking about trying to get you to see in reality the calvary come to pass then you could bring salvation into view abraham met god in reality real personal saw him talked with him fed him communion see god was looking there and he said lord before the world this is the man are you women and listen to one talking about god could look before the world by his infinite foreknowledge and thing he said i'm looking for somebody that i could contact did he wind up being the father of faith that he wind up all the things and wind up the book of of hebrews 11 lays a lot on abraham and he says i've i've got the man now all i got to do is let him know it i've chosen him and everything's going to be all right but now he's got to choose me in other words he's got to make up his own mind now that there's something about this it's a reality you take moses listen i was thinking about him the other day you're taking reading the scriptures on what i'm studying on there's moses he goes out on the backside of the desert right he gets run off he goes out he's out there for about 40 years and all at once something began to talk to him in a way that a bush got on fire he went to see about it then god began to talk to him you think god didn't know how to contact him the way brother branham brings it if you'll listen to him he said what moses was he said he was a uh uh he was a in other words he had the ability to study it out and he thought about now that bush is not supposed to be burning moses was a very smart man he could teach the egyptians and them egyptians could do a lot of things in that day but there when he contacted moses he said moses i want you to go he said i can't talk i can't do it he tried to do everything he could to get out of it look at that human god said okay i'll give you a mouth aaron will be your prophet he'll be your mouthpiece and you bring up any excuse you want to i'm going to answer that excuse and i'm going to tell you moses said who do i tell them he said i believe that you're the god of abraham isaac and jacob but he said i want something personal now i want this thing to be where they there's not going to be any argument when i get down there where i won't be obscured i can step out and say this is it he said just go tell him i am sensing now why did moses grab that all at once there's not a word in there i've read that and studied that and pondered over it thinking about there's not one word in there that moses said another word after that when he said i am that i am he said okay i'm ready to go brother brown said he run away taking his kids throwing them on on the the back of the donkey now he went naturally probably moses as a human being he probably thought a lot about it he thought well surely there's a contact i've made here with something supernatural so i could go down there and just whoop the whole crowd because remember moses was the the leader in in all the armies and everything of of egypt he could have caused it insurrection but he said get you a stick and let's go by this stick you'll be able to take over that nation he said well i see now it's not going to be my my power with a a group of army buddies that's going to help me get this thing started i'm kind of facing it by myself and he goes walking out what caused david to just say why are y'all so scared of that guy standing out there well he ain't nothing a little old run him standing out there and david looking over there like you know hey look at that little old run out there said man that's what that man was saying to him he ain't never a little runt come out here to fight me but to david he the giant was just a run he didn't care he said the buyer the line took care of them i just take care of this right he put five smooth stones in there because they said that he had four brothers that might come up to help him right so he said i'll just make sure and care enough to where i got enough to take care of them because i'm going to take care of the whole thing because i've done met in person now listen i want you to listen abraham met the person of god called melchizedek two or three times out of his meeting moses met god in a burning bush david met god with that crucial oil that was poured on his head because like i've always tried to get you to see once david was anointed he wouldn't obscure to nothing once he was anointed to be king he knew one thing for certain he was going to be king because the prophet told him the word told him he probably thought it over and thought well i may not live but just a few days after doing but i'm going to sit on that throne because god doesn't told me predestination made simple god before the world looked down through time and saw all that would ever take place and all it would ever be but it's like i've told you why can't you say god's over here right now looking back why can't you realize that he's here with you i thought that's what that i am meant when moses i'm asking you have you ever had a personal experience like moses with an i am at a burning bush have you ever met god and enough to worry that you know that he's real i told you about the story and all that that's what uh luke said he he likes for me to tell him stories that's one thing he like i told you the story of what happened with wade when i asked god to give some sign or someone or whatever for what i could talk to wade about his salvation and i saw a foot like of a deer where we was hunting at even the neighbor down there where you could go talk to him and he went around he said sam saw this deerfoot some way in a dream and said we just went around there behind the church and said darn enough three legs and a nub you know it didn't bother him he didn't throw off on all of it he talked about it said he saw it in a dream well see there i was all upset sitting up there in the woods because some crazy female i thought had got out there and spraying perfume everywhere because the sweetest melon you ever smell come down through them woods and i said now lord all of this that the other everything had went wrong everything in the day had went wrong just totally backwards to whatever the only thing that made me stay down there i had the only vehicle that could pull the camper so i stayed with them to whether they could get set up and everything then i left and come on home the next day you know and our wade killed this big old deer well i asked him on the way home i said do you think that's kind of unusual he said yeah that's your head i said well then let's talk a little bit because god done told me something unusual i was supposed to see that he said daddy that ain't all of it he said donald stumbled all over them woods trying to find a place to put me up and he said i couldn't use the bathroom and he said i had to use the bathroom at the base of the tree you know that's taboo and the deer come right up to where he was at and he shot him and killed him had to jump over and shoot him in the opposite side my point is what i believed god would someday come in contact with me about that because he showed me dreams and showed me things about it have you ever had anything just to be so personal and you see it come to piss you know you see it yourself something comes to price you understand what i'm driving at god come down to mo abraham so much until abraham saw a man he come so close into moses until moses met a man in a burning bush david met a man that was a king of israel and he come forth to fight the battle something personal is your salvation before the foundation of the world everybody wants to try to make it something if i was back there now i know i'll be back there well what are you trying to make it i'm trying to make it right here this is my predestination it was determined that i be here today to bring the message that's my predestination that's the way i look i look at things personal god is real he'll come to you if he'll just believe it that way but it may be in the stillness of the night it may be through somebody maybe any kind of thing he's got some reason well what was his reasoning abraham that he saw before the world ever begun that there'd be a man on the earth he'd be looking for a place for this seed to land because that's what he was doing because that was the word and he saw there was one man who would accept it two thousand years or ever what it took going before the foundation over to where abraham was and god just stops him for a minute and says abraham abraham says what i mean we look at it as a five-minute story today that god appears to abraham and then he just no i think it could have been quite a little bit and abraham was thinking it over and mulling it in his mind what's going on here he said come follow me like i say about those disciples he walks up to the disciples he says come follow me no they just throw down everything left now before the world ever begun god saw that but he knew he'd have to be there personally with them for it to ever amount to anything is your religion that personal is it personal enough to hold you when everything goes wrong brother branham did you keep your religion no no it kept me what about it just trying to get you to think about it trying to get you to think john 15 and 6 says ye have not chosen me but i chose you but now here's my point always to do it what if they hadn't accepted that as being god romans 8. in number six talking about a um jacob and esau come on just bring it on up what shall we say to these things to this is there any unrighteousness with god in other words did god choose it looks like he did because he said moses i'll have mercy on whom i'll have mercy i'll just do what i want to but does he do what he wants to does god do what he wants to do or does he know what it'll take to contact you but brother dale you talk like we need to be prophets and this that and the other well why not we'll get to it this evening about predestination god picks and chooses who what he wants to do with his gifts you agree if you don't you got a problem but gifts and callings are without repentance you don't repent to get a gift but all gifts don't come predestinated eternally all gifts come predestinated as to god knowing he's going to give them but the fifo ministry is predestinated eternally from god but yet we don't want to look at it like that but why not what made god contact you every how you want to bring it however you want to do it you want to bring it down whatever he came down one day and contacted you maybe in the still of the night maybe in some you know maybe while somebody was preaching maybe while somebody was you know directing or doing whatever all kinds of things i remember brother tatum i i used to we used to talk a lot he said i'm sitting out there on that tree and he said it just he said just like raindrops coming down on me the spirit of the lord coming present to him see it was a reality have you ever met him as real have you ever had the burning bush experience you ever been to that basis that you could feel his presence and just know that he's real i've turned around and looked to try to and then realize hey i need to just stop instead of looking i don't need to try to find him he's already found me because he's real god is real he's not just a fugitive of your imagination or some thought you have in your mind or some good point that you're thinking about he's real children just talk to him he likes to talk to you but make your calling now let me get this last point real close make your calling and election sure now what that means to me is one thing make sure of your salvation make sure of one thing that god before the world set back there and in his mind he saw everything that would ever take place he saw you sitting right here today before the world make your calling and election put it in the word of god make it real make it something that you can be proud of to do and contact that he's made with you what about it can you make your call can you put your calling because see many are called but few are chosen that's what the word says many are called why because they're called to come to him but they don't come but don't you think he knows that before the world he knew what it would take to call you to get you to stop if josh was here he could tell you a lot about his when he tried to silly oh there he is back in the corner sitting down when he tried to pass that car and wrecked up and everything two or three people stopped behind him and josh gets out of the car and that old tree i still see it every time i go by there there's a piece of bark missing about that big where he sideswiped that tree and people said where's that other guy he said what do you mean he said there was nobody in the car but me he said we saw a man i think was three people said we saw a man get out of the car and walk down through the woods well you know what it's about time to wake up when you get it like that it's time to wake up danny when you go head first off to the house of kapoor down beside of it's about time to wake up somebody's trying to get our attention it's that personal to me it's real god is real he's not just a fidget of your imagination he's real wants to talk to us he wants to fellowship with us come on musicians he wants to have a little time with me and you god loves his people he wants to talk you know he wants to fellowship with you he wants you to to accept him and let him do the rest but the first thing or all things to just remember one thing predestination looks back to foreknowledge so god before the world looked down and saw every gnat that would ever be in the world and every time it bat its eye and saw you and every day you're living but see to remember now this is what i'm saying see tomorrow's not here let's don't worry about it today is the day of salvation today is the time to make your decision to accept him as your personal savior and let him take care of the rest of it no matter what age you are how old or what he's doing he's waiting on us because he's trying to contact us could it be he's not he's not going to do everybody the same way so everybody's not going to have the same burning bush you don't have to wait to try to find you a bush somewhere to talk to god well when he does that with me i'll talk to him no no it might be anything during the night or in a day or whatever it might be might ever be something a wreck or something to happen something just happening to you because it's personal when they were in the upper room there was 120 and they had little licks of fire sitting on each one of them they had something real is your experience real i'm just trying to get you to think about these things just talking about these things and saying predestination is very simple god predetermines but what he foresaw then he can set the destiny of each and every one of us but remember as he sets that destiny he's leaving you and me because we'll get to it this afternoon see faith versus knowledge temperature all those things has got to be in somebody in the end time we're the people that predestination there's never been a people predestinated unto adoption except this end time people now because even your pentecostals couldn't accept it they accepted the birth the prophet said they made their mistake by not going on see you and i are going to go somebody's going to go to a change of the body that's a predetermined position you remember the women in the bible that asked them said let our children sit here in this hour on your side in the in your kingdom he said that's not for me to give he said but it's predestinated somebody's going to be there see your predestination hangs on the basis of whether or not you can believe that it's personal to you what do we got brother joe let's stand let's just sing that song i just want to thank you lord and i just want to thank you lord for letting me hear your words such glory reveal to me god looked down and saw everything that would ever take place [Music] face to face [Music] [Applause] [Music] me thank god [Music] can you say lord just come find me [Music] was wretched [Music] her the preaching the message of grace [Music] we pray that what we've tried to make lord into words that would be brought into the hearts of the people lord that we're living our predestination we're walking each day in the word we've had a burning bush experience and a lot of things we've met god in a lot of ways but now it's time for you to come on the scene to each one of us and father just reach down and touch each one remember all the sick among us remember sister sister cleat the lord and all the things our and sister to it see father brother isle [Music] brother colley brother daugherty lord and all these brothers remember a wife lord just reach down and make it something personal that we can walk off this earth in you you chose us but we've got to accept the fact of you choosing us and we got to walk not just sit down and say well i've done it and finished now but to walk in you just have your way lord forgive our sins be with wade and tune them on the way back home today and just take care of them let your loving grace be with each one in jesus name amen you just missed lord thank you
